{"id": "3924891", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice SAYLOR.\nThis is a direct appeal from a sentence of death imposed by the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, following Appellant Junious G. Diggs\u2019 conviction of the first-degree murder of Johnetta Bryant and related charges.\nBackground\nOn March 16, 2002, thirteen-year-old Kaneesha Cooper (\u201cKaneesha\u201d) was sitting on her front porch on Beaumont Street in Philadelphia while her mother Johnetta Bryant (the victim) and Kaneesha\u2019s two brothers were inside. Kaneesha was playing with her friend Marquis, and her brothers were upstairs watching television; the victim was in the first-floor dining room. At approximately 7:00 p.m., Appellant, a neighbor known to Kaneesha as \u201cBinky,\u201d arrived and asked if Kaneesha\u2019s mother was home. Kaneesha \u2014 who was aware that Appellant had recently argued with her mother \u2014 indicated that she would get her mother from inside and bring her out, but that Appellant should not go inside because her mother might be getting dressed. Appellant did not wait, however, and entered the home directly behind Kaneesha, pushing the latter out of the way to approach the victim. When Appellant saw the victim, the two started arguing. Kaneesha picked up the phone to call the police because her mother had told her that Appellant was not allowed in the house. While trying to place the call, Kaneesha heard her mother say, \u201cGet out of my house,\u201d to which Appellant replied, \u201cOkay, you going to call the cops, try to get me locked up[?]\u201d He then produced a gun and shot the victim a total of ten times, killing her. Kaneesha ran to her friend\u2019s home nearby and summoned the police.\nWhen the police arrived, Kaneesha\u2019s twin brother Klinton told them that he heard gunshots while upstairs with his younger brother. Kaneesha, who was now back at her home, told police that \u201cBinky\u201d shot her mother. Kaneesha and her siblings were transported to the police station, where she gave a statement and identified Appellant from a photo array. Meanwhile, Appellant fled the Commonwealth and was ultimately apprehended two months later upon his return to Philadelphia.\nAn autopsy revealed that the victim was shot twice in the groin, once in the upper arm consistent with a defensive wound, once in the face, and six times in the back of the head. The medical examiner testified that some of the wounds were consistent with an individual standing over the victim and shooting downward. In this regard, a Crime Scene Unit officer who inspected the scene also observed that at least four shots were fired at close range in a deliberate downward motion, penetrating an area of the carpet that was saturated with blood. Three of these rounds landed in the basement, and one became embedded in the dining room floor. No empty shell casings were recovered from the basement.\nOn March 5, 2004, a jury found Appellant guilty of first-degree murder, burglary, criminal trespass, and possessing an instrument of crime. At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jurors found one aggravating circumstance \u2014 that the killing was committed in perpetration of the felony of burglary, see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6) \u2014 as well as the \u201ccatchall\u201d mitigator, see id., \u00a7 9711(e)(8). Having unanimously concluded that the former outweighed the latter, the jury set the penalty at death. See N.T. March 9, 2004, at 44; 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv). The court formally imposed the death penalty and additionally sentenced Appellant to an aggregate term of seven-and-a-half to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment for burglary and possessing an instrument of crime. The court did not impose a separate sentence for criminal trespass, as it considered the offense to merge with burglary for sentencing purposes.\nAfter an automatic appeal was lodged with this Court, trial counsel withdrew and appellate counsel was appointed. This Court then remanded the record for preparation of an opinion. The trial court filed its opinion and supplemental opinion on September 7, 2006, and October 10, 2006, respectively.\nSufficiency and Weight of the Evidence\nAppellant first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the first-degree murder conviction. To obtain a conviction for first-degree murder, the Commonwealth must demonstrate that: a human being was unlawfully killed; the defendant was the killer; and the defendant acted with malice and a specific intent to kill. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2501, 2502(a); Commonwealth v. Moore, 594 Pa. 619, 628, 937 A.2d 1062, 1067 (2007) (citing Commonwealth v. Collins, 550 Pa. 46, 50, 703 A.2d 418, 420 (1997)). In determining whether there was sufficient evidentiary support for a jury\u2019s finding to this effect, the reviewing court inquires whether the proofs, considered in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, are sufficient to enable a reasonable jury to find every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. See Commonwealth v. Crews, 436 Pa. 346, 348, 260 A.2d 771, 771-72 (1970). The court bears in mind that: the Commonwealth may sustain its burden by means of wholly circumstantial evidence; the entire trial record should be evaluated and all evidence received considered, whether or not the trial court\u2019s rulings thereon were correct; and the trier of fact, while passing upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight of the evidence, is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence. See Commonwealth v. Cousar, 593 Pa. 204, 217, 928 A.2d 1025, 1032-33 (2007); Commonwealth v. Harper, 485 Pa. 572, 576-77, 403 A.2d 536, 538-39 (1979).\nAppellant admits that, because he shot the victim multiple times at close range, the jury was permitted to infer that he acted with malice, and therefore, that he committed murder. He thus focuses his argument on the question of whether he acted with a specific intent to kill Ms. Bryant. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Taylor, 583 Pa. 170, 186, 876 A.2d 916, 926 (2005) (observing that, apart from felony murder, any murder committed without specific intent constitutes third-degree murder). In this respect, although he concedes that forming a specific intent to kill \u201ccan take but a moment,\u201d Appellant maintains that the evidence was insufficient to support that conclusion, as it seemed rather to indicate that he entered the house calmly and then acted upon a sudden provocation when confronted with \u201chollering\u201d by the victim.\nAlthough Appellant also references other factors that might be consistent with a finding that he did not harbor a specific intent to kill, the overarching difficulty with his argument is that he interprets the evidence in a manner most favorable to himself. Viewing the proofs favorably to the prosecution, it is relevant that Appellant had recently argued with the victim, arrived at the her house with a gun, ignored her daughter\u2019s directive to stay outside (and indeed pushed the daughter aside to enter the residence), responded in an angry manner to the victim\u2019s command to leave the premises, and then shot the victim a total of ten times, including twice in the groin, once in the face, and six times in the back of the head. Of particular importance is the testimony provided by the ballistics expert and the medical examiner indicating that Appellant stood over the victim, firing downward at the back of her head while she lay face-down on the floor. As a specific intent to kill may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body, see Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 580 Pa. 303, 308, 860 A.2d 102, 106 (2004), we conclude that the jury was justified in finding Appellant guilty of first-degree murder.\nAppellant also questions whether the evidence was sufficient to support his burglary conviction. An individual commits burglary \u201cif he enters a building or occupied structure, or separately secured or occupied portion thereof, with intent to commit a crime therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the actor is licensed or privileged to enter.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3502(a). The only question Appellant raises is whether the evidence showed that he was not privileged to enter. He maintains that he was known to, and liked by, the family; highlights testimony to the effect that Kaneesha had ushered him into the home, see N.T. March 3, 2004, at 79 (reflecting Marquis\u2019 testimony that Appellant asked Kaneesha \u201cif her mother was in, she said yes, and she escorted him in\u201d); and discounts Kaneesha\u2019s contrary testimony as coming from an \u201cinterested witness.\u201d He also argues that the record does not reflect that Kaneesha ever told Appellant he was not permitted to enter.\nAppellant states, correctly, that he had known the family for a number of years \u2014 indeed, there was testimony that he was a neighbor whom Kaneesha had seen approximately every other day of her life. Notably, however, there was also evidence indicating that, in all those years, Appellant had only been inside the victim\u2019s home on one occasion, see N.T. March 3, 2004 at 34 (testimony of Kaneesha Cooper); that the victim had told her family members that Appellant was not permitted inside, see id. at 30; that Appellant had to \u201cshove\u201d Kaneesha out of the way in order to enter, see id.; and that the victim immediately ordered Appellant to leave the house as soon as she saw him, see id. at 43-44 (testimony of Kaneesha Cooper, recounting that her mother \u201cjumped up when she saw me come in and [Appellant] was right behind me. First thing my mother said was get out.\u201d). Furthermore, regardless of how the situation may have appeared to Marquis, the jurors apparently believed Kaneesha\u2019s specific recollection that she had told Appellant not to enter the premises at the time of the incident. See generally Cousar, 593 Pa. at 219, 928 A.2d at 1033 (an appellate court is not authorized to substitute its estimation of a witness\u2019s credibility for that of the jury); Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 415, 383 A.2d 155, 167 (1978) (\u201cA jury has the duty to weigh the evidence and resolve conflicts therein.\u201d). As for Appellant\u2019s assertion that Kaneesha never told him he was not permitted to enter, the record is to the contrary, as Kaneesha testified as follows:\nSo I walked up the [outside] steps to go get my mother, and before I hit the door, he was right behind me. And I said, \u201cOh no, you can wait, I\u2019ll go get her for you because I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s dressed.\u201d\nN.T. March 3, 2004, at 29. This reflects that Appellant lacked permission to enter the residence. Although Appellant suggests that Kaneesha\u2019s instructions conveyed that he was privileged to enter if, in fact, Ms. Bryant was already dressed, see Brief for Appellant at 15-16, he cannot prevail on this assertion because, taking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, Kaneesha\u2019s directive was to wait outside, and her expressed concern about her mother\u2019s possible state of undress was merely the explanation for the directive.\nWhen all of the above evidence is viewed favorably to the Commonwealth, it adequately supports the jury\u2019s finding that Appellant was not licensed or privileged to enter the premises, and that he entered \u201cwith intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3502(a).\nAppellant also briefly argues that the verdicts were against the weight of the evidence. As to the burglary conviction, Appellant largely repeats his arguments concerning evidentiary sufficiency, noting in particular that only one witness (Kaneesha) provided the testimony suggesting a lack of privilege to enter, and that that witness\u2019s recitation of the events was in tension with the testimony of her friend, Marquis. He adds, as well, that there was no protection from abuse order in place, and that nothing in the record indicates that he had been told on any prior occasion that he could not simply enter the victim\u2019s house at will. Appellant again, in this context, emphasizes that he was known to, and liked by, the victim\u2019s family. As for the murder charge, Appellant highlights that there was no proof of any \u201cbad blood\u201d between himself and the victim; rather, he suggests that the proofs at trial demonstrated that as soon as he entered the home, he was \u201cverbally attacked by the victim,\u201d which caused him to fly \u201cinto a rage, firing multiple times.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 21. This, Appellant indicates, is consistent with third-degree murder, not with premeditated murder.\nA motion for a new trial alleging that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence is addressed to the discretion of the trial court. An appellate court, therefore, reviews the exercise of discretion, not the underlying question whether the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. The factfinder is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence and to determine the credibility of the witnesses. The trial court will award a new trial only when the jury\u2019s verdict is so contrary to the evidence as to shock one\u2019s sense of justice. In determining whether this standard has been met, appellate review is limited to whether the trial judge\u2019s discretion was properly exercised, and relief will only be granted where the facts and inferences of record disclose a palpable abuse of discretion. Thus, the trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial based on a weight of the evidence claim is the least assailable of its rulings. Cousar, 593 Pa. at 222-23, 928 A.2d at 1035-36 (citing Commonwealth v. Keaton, 556 Pa. 442, 464, 729 A.2d 529, 540-41 (1999)).\nIn response to Appellant\u2019s weight-of-the-evidence claim, the common pleas court recounted the substantial trial proofs indicating that Appellant entered the premises uninvited and without permission, and fired six rounds into the back of the victim\u2019s head after being instructed to leave. As for Appellant\u2019s contention that he \u201cflew into a rage,\u201d thus negating any inference of premeditation, Appellant fails to point to any evidence in the record supporting such a contention. Although Appellant did apparently adopt a confrontational attitude toward the victim immediately before killing her, the jury did not extrapolate this evidence to find that he suffered a sudden bout of passion that prevented him from forming a specific intent to kill. Particularly in view of the forensic evidence, recited above, tending to show that Appellant specifically intended to kill his unarmed victim, the jury\u2019s findings in this regard do not shock one\u2019s sense of justice. Accordingly, the trial court acted within its discretion in rejecting this claim.\nAlleged Prosecutorial Misconduct in the Guilt Phase\nAppellant next avers that he is entitled to a new trial because the Commonwealth, in its closing argument to the jury, stated that the victim\u2019s daughter, Kaneesha Cooper, told anyone who would listen to her for the past two years (the time between the incident and the trial) that Appellant killed her mother. The prosecutor argued as follows:\n[PROSECUTOR]: You heard the testimony of K[a]neesha Cooper as she sat here as grown up as a 15 year old can be under the circumstances. Faced her mother\u2019s killer and told you, the members of the audience and anybody who would listen, he shot my mother, Binky, killed my mother. She came in here, she faced you all, she faced him, and she said it. And it wasn\u2019t the first time K[a]neesha Cooper has said it. As a matter of fact, for the last two years, she has been telling anyone who would listen to her that Binky\u2014\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.\n[PROSECUTOR]: \u2014 Killed her mother.\nTHE COURT: Overruled.\nN.T. March 4, 2004 at 108-09.\nAppellant submits that there is nothing in the record to establish that Kaneesha Cooper \u201chas been telling anyone who would listen\u201d about the shooting. He maintains the prosecutor embellished the Commonwealth\u2019s case with facts extrinsic to the record, which had the effect of bolstering her central witness\u2019s credibility, and that the trial court erred in overruling counsel\u2019s contemporaneous objection. The Commonwealth responds that the argument represented permissible oratorical flair and/or a permissible inference from the evidence that was presented, and that the statement was not prejudicial in any event because Appellant admits he was the killer.\nIt is undisputed that Kaneesha Cooper identified Appellant as the shooter, and that she never wavered from this identification or from her recitation of the facts that led up to the shooting. Thus, even to the extent the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that Kaneesha also told other, unnamed, individuals that \u201cBinky shot my mother\u201d exceeded the scope of the facts known to the jury, it does not appear to have been especially prejudicial; this is particularly true as Appellant has never denied shooting Ms. Bryant, and has instead argued that he lacked a specific intent to kill. See, e.g., N.T. March 4, 2004, at 91 (reflecting counsel\u2019s guilt-phase summation in which he stated that \u201c[Appellant] shot her, and shot her dead,\u201d but urged the jury not to find premeditation); id. at 97 (indicating counsel\u2019s continuing guilt-phase summation to the effect that \u201c[t]hird degree murder would be the right decision in this particular case.\u201d); Appellant\u2019s Rule 1925(b) Statement at 1 (\u201c[Appellant], acting in a rage, killed the victim.\u201d). Thus, because the prosecutor\u2019s embellishment was both relatively minor and irrelevant to the contested issue of specific intent to kill, any error by the trial court in overruling counsel\u2019s objection was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nGuilt Phase Jury Instructions\nIn his last two. guilt-phase claims, Appellant alleges that the trial court erred during the jury charge when it defined malice, and when it remarked that it might have to re-instruct the jury on the elements of first-degree murder. Neither claim is preserved for review, as counsel did not raise any contemporaneous objection to the jury charge, and the errors that he asserted during his post-instruction colloquy with the trial court did not pertain to either of these alleged errors. See N.T. March 5, 2004 at 39-46. Thus, these issues are waived and may only be reviewed within the framework of an ineffectiveness allegation during post-conviction proceedings. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (\u201cIssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d); Commonwealth v. May, 584 Pa. 640, 654, 887 A.2d 750, 758 (2005); see also Commonwealth v. Freeman, 573 Pa. 532, 560, 827 A.2d 385, 402 (2003) (abrogating the relaxed waiver doctrine for capital direct appeals). Appellant also proffers that, in the event counsel\u2019s objections are deemed not pertinent to the alleged jury instruction errors, his attorney provided ineffective assistance for failing to raise any pertinent objection. As this Court stated in Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726 (2002), such ineffectiveness claims must await collateral proceedings under the Post Conviction Relief Act. See id. at 67, 813 A.2d at 738 (\u201cWe now hold that, as a general rule, a petitioner should wait to raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel until collateral review.\u201d).\nAlleged Need for Separate Mitigation Counsel\nNext, Appellant contends that he is entitled to a new penalty hearing because he was not provided with a separate attorney for the penalty phase of his trial. In support of this claim, Appellant asserts that counsel told the court that he had expected a separate lawyer to handle the penalty phase, and that he had written to the president judge requesting either authorization to bill the government for a second attorney or an additional fee for handling the mitigation aspect of the case himself. See Brief for Appellant at 25 (quoting N.T. March 8, 2004 at 18). Nevertheless, Appellant does not maintain that counsel either requested that the trial court appoint another lawyer or objected to the lack of one, nor does our review of the record indicate that any such request or objection was made. Rather, counsel recited that two other individuals in his office (including another attorney) had been helping him plan for the mitigation case; affirmed that he was \u201cprepared to go forward\u201d with the penalty phase, N.T. March 8, 2004 at 18-19; and ultimately presented several mitigation witnesses, including a forensic psychologist who testified at length concerning Appellant\u2019s troubled upbringing, developmental delays, functional illiteracy, and apparent psychotic tendencies, see id. at 76-107 (testimony of Dr. Steven Samuel); see also Brief for Appellant at 29 (declining to find fault with trial counsel\u2019s \u201cmarshalling of witnesses,\u201d but arguing nonetheless that the \u201ccourt administration\u201d was at fault for allowing Appellant to proceed with an attorney whom he did not trust). Thus, pursuant to Grant, any error along the lines of that which Appellant now advances must be raised within the framework of an ineffectiveness claim during post-conviction review proceedings.\nPenalty Phase Jury Instructions\nAppellant takes issue with the manner in which the trial court instructed the jury during the penalty phase concerning the finding and weighing of aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and states that counsel \u201cinexplicably\u201d failed to object to these instructions. Because this claim was not raised below, it is waived and cannot be reviewed at this juncture. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (\u201cIssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d); Freeman, 573 Pa. at 560, 827 A.2d at 402 (abrogating the relaxed waiver doctrine for capital direct appeals). To the extent Appellant attempts to raise an assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel, such a claim must await collateral review. See supra note 5.\nNon-Statutory Aggravating Factor\nIn his only preserved claim from the penalty-phase of trial, Appellant suggests that the trial court erred in overruling counsel\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s alleged introduction of a non-statutory aggravating circumstance. During its summation, the Commonwealth proceeded as follows:\n[PROSECUTOR]: So when we think about aggravators, the aggravator in this case that the Commonwealth has established beyond a reasonable doubt is that during the course of committing this crime he did so with a felony, and that felony was burglary. Now, on top of the burglary, on top of the shooting, multiple shootings, on top of her being unarmed, on top of her being\u2014\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, your Honor.\n[PROSECUTOR]: \u2014 in her own house\u2014\nTHE COURT: Overruled.\n[PROSECUTOR]: \u2014 he did all of that in front of his [sic] kids. In front of her children. And that is the aggravator that we\u2019re asking you to consider.\nN.T. March 9, 2004 at 20-21.\nAppellant contends that these comments were improper, as the permissible aggravating factors are enumerated by statute, and they do not include the fact that the killing occurred in front of the victim\u2019s children. While acknowledging that the Commonwealth is permitted some latitude to employ oratorical flair, Appellant argues that advocating for non-statutory aggravators is beyond the scope of such latitude, and references Commonwealth v. LaCava, 542 Pa. 160, 666 A.2d 221 (1995), and Commonwealth v. Morales, 549 Pa. 400, 701 A.2d 516 (1997), for support. In LaCava, this Court vacated the appellant\u2019s death sentence and remanded for a new sentencing hearing because, during the penalty phase summation, the prosecutor launched into a prolonged tirade concerning drug dealers being a \u201cleech on society\u201d and ruining neighborhoods, and had, in effect, turned the jury\u2019s sentencing decision \u201cinto a plebiscite on drugs and drug dealers and their destructive effect on society.\u201d LaCava, 542 Pa. at 191-192, 666 A.2d at 237. The Morales court also ordered a new sentencing hearing due to improper prosecutorial argument in the penalty phase; in that matter, the prosecutor had, in effect, invited the jury to impose the death sentence as a means of compensating for the lenient treatment that the criminal justice system had allegedly afforded to other offenders, and as a way of forestalling any similar treatment that might otherwise be given to the defendant. See Morales, 549 Pa. at 425-26, 701 A.2d at 528-29. Appellant indicates that this case is similar to LaCava and Morales because the Commonwealth relied on \u201cpurely extraneous and improper matters\u201d as a basis for sentencing him to death.\nFor its part, the Commonwealth posits that any issue concerning introduction of a non-statutory aggravator is waived because counsel\u2019s objection occurred before the prosecutor mentioned the victim\u2019s children or indicated that the factors mentioned should be considered as an aggravator, and no new objection was lodged after the district attorney made the statements of which Appellant now complains. The Commonwealth avers that this is understandable because \u201cit was clear from the prosecutor\u2019s preface that \u2018the aggravator in this case ... is that during the course of committing this crime, [Appellant] did so with a felony, and that felony was burglary.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Commonwealth at 33-34 & n. 16.\nIn our view, the objection can fairly be seen as covering the line of argument that the prosecutor was malting concerning extrinsic factors, thus preserving the issue for our present review. Moreover, while the circumstances that the prosecutor emphasized may have been relevant to the grave-risk aggravator had it been \u25a0 presented for consideration, see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(7), they do not relate to burglary so as to trigger the (d)(6) aggravator. Therefore, the challenged comments were improper, particularly as the prosecutor preceded them with, \u201cNow, on top of the burglary ...\u201d and thus, counsel\u2019s objection should have been sustained. The question is whether the court\u2019s failure to sustain the objection was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAs noted, Appellant argues for a finding of prejudice based on LaCava and Morales. In each of those decisions, the Commonwealth had encouraged the jury to center its attention on the concept that broad, societal ills could be at least partially remedied by sentencing the defendant to death. In a similar vein, this Court has held that \u201cpenalty phase arguments requesting that the jury send a message [to society] with its verdict are prejudicial per se.\u201d Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 580 Pa. 303, 330, 860 A.2d 102, 119 (2004); see also Commonwealth v. Chambers, 528 Pa. 558, 586, 599 A.2d 630, 644 (1991) (concluding that advocating for a death sentence predicated upon religious writings constitutes reversible error because it suggests that the jury should base its decision on an independent source of law). By contrast, prosecutorial death penalty arguments directed solely to the events underlying the litigation at hand have generally been evaluated on a case-by-case basis for prejudice, even where they have had the arguable effect of misrepresenting Pennsylvania law. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Simmons, 541 Pa. 211, 662 A.2d 621 (1995) (allowing a death sentence to stand notwithstanding the prosecutor\u2019s improper (albeit indirect) suggestion that the defendant could be paroled if sentenced to life imprisonment rather than death, where the trial court had issued a curative instruction to the jury).\nPresently, the district attorney did not argue for the death sentence as a way to ameliorate the problems of, or send a message to, society at large. Rather, her remark can be construed, at most, to imply that one of the aggravating factors permitted under Pennsylvania law is that Appellant killed Ms. Bryant in front of her daughter. Any misconception in this regard, however, was dispelled by the trial court\u2019s subsequent jury charge, in which the court clarified that the only two aggravating factors submitted were that the defendant has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person, see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9), and that the defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony, see id., \u00a7 9711(d)(6), specifically, burglary. See N.T. March 9, 2004 at 29 (\u201cIn this case the felony involved is burglary as I have defined the crime of burglary to you during the trial.\u201d). See generally Commonwealth v. Stokes, 576 Pa. 299, 306, 839 A.2d 226, 230 (2003) (\u201cA jury is presumed to follow the court\u2019s instructions.\u201d). The verdict slip likewise recited that only the (d)(6) and (d)(9) aggravators were being submitted for the jury\u2019s consideration.\nThe district attorney\u2019s passing reference in this regard was also unlike the lengthy diatribe at issue in LaCava concerning the evils perpetrated upon society by drug dealers. See LaCava, 542 Pa. at 191-92, 666 A.2d at 236 (quoting the prosecutor\u2019s protracted speech denouncing individuals who sell illegal drugs). It was a brief, offhand remark that appears to reflect possible momentary confusion on the part of the prosecutor, particularly as she had indicated, immediately prior to the challenged remark, that the sole \u201caggravator in this case\u201d is that the killing occurred in perpetration of the felony of burglary. Accordingly, the comment does not seem more than minimally prejudicial when viewed within the context of all of the circumstances of the case. See generally Commonwealth v. Dennis, 552 Pa. 331, 347, 715 A.2d 404, 411-12 (1998) (reciting that the effect of improper prosecutorial argumentation must be evaluated by \u201cconsidering all the circumstances of the case\u201d). We therefore find that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nStatutory Review\nHaving concluded that Appellant\u2019s convictions were proper and that none of his claims of error entitles him to relief, we must affirm his sentence of death unless we find that: (i) the sentence was the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; or (ii) the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3). Upon careful review of the record, we are persuaded that the death sentence was not the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, but resulted from properly introduced evidence that Appellant intentionally and deliberately shot Johnetta Bryant to death. We also conclude that the evidence was sufficient to support the single aggravating factor found by the jury in relation to the killing. Specifically, the fact that Appellant was convicted of burglary in connection with the shooting of Ms. Bryant provides sufficient evidence to support the aggravating circumstance that Appellant committed the killing in perpetration of a felony. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6).\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of sentence. The Prothonotary of this Court is directed to transmit the complete record of this case to the Governor of Pennsylvania in accordance with Section 971 l(i) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(i).\nFormer Chief Justice CAPPY and former Justices BALDWIN and FITZGERALD did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justice EAKIN and BAER join the opinion.\n. The need for a supplemental opinion arose because Appellant was granted permission to file a supplemental Rule 1925 statement raising issues pertaining to the jury charge once the transcript of that charge became available.\n. Appellant\u2019s argument in this regard is consistent with his presentation to the jury in which he conceded malice and sought a third-degree murder verdict.\n. For example, she told several police officers as well as other individuals at the crime scene that Appellant had shot her mother; she then repeated this accusation in her statement to the police, in her identification of Appellant from a police photo array, and in court. Her account was corroborated by her friend, Marquis Parker, who saw Appellant enter the victim's house, heard the argument between Appellant and Ms. Bryant, heard the ensuing gunfire, and then immediately witnessed Kaneesha run out of the house crying and screaming, \u201cBinky shot my mother.\u201d See N.T. March 3, 2004 at 75-87.\n. Appellant does claim that it was standard protocol in Philadelphia to afford all capital defendants a second attorney, and so he was denied equal protection and due process. See id. at 26-27. However, Appellant does not reference any policy documents to this effect or advert to any relevant evidence. Therefore, his presentation to this Court is insufficient to establish a constitutional violation. In all events, any constitutional claim based on the lack of a second attorney for mitigation purposes is waived, as it was not raised before the trial court. See generally Commonwealth v. Moore, 594 Pa. 619, 627, 937 A.2d 1062, 1066 (2007) (citing Freeman, and recognizing that the relaxed waiver doctrine is unavailable for any capital direct appeal filed after May 30, 2003).\n. Appellant acknowledges the rule established in Grant, but requests that it not be applied here. However, he does not identify any exception to the Grant doctrine that would obtain in the present case. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Bomar, 573 Pa. 426, 826 A.2d 831 (2003) (establishing a narrow exception to Grant for cases in which the post-sentence court has conducted an evidentiary hearing on the ineffectiveness claim and resolved it on the merits); Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 576 Pa. 258, 269, 839 A.2d 202, 208 (2003) (acknowledging that Grant expressed a \"strong preference ... to postpone review of all ineffectiveness claims to the collateral process,\u201d and that the Bomar exception only pertains where the lower court conducted a hearing and provided a full consideration of the issue). Appellant does suggest that there is no need for evidentiary development, but we disagree, as there is little in the present record to indicate whether counsel's stewardship was deficient or whether Appellant suffered any prejudice. See generally Commonwealth v. Cooper, 596 Pa. 119, 133, 941 A.2d 655, 664 (2007) (\"To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the defendant bears the burden of establishing: 1) an underlying claim of arguable merit; 2) no reasonable basis for counsel's act or omission; and 3) prejudice as a result, that is, a reasonable probability that but for counsel's act or omission, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d).\n. Appellant does not take issue with the references to the victim being unarmed and in her own home. In any event, these statements were based on the trial evidence and were within the bounds of permissible advocacy."}
