{"id": "875826", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nThe undisputed facts of this case bring it within the principles of Loux & Son v. Fox et al., 171 Pa. 68. For reasons given in that case, we think due diligence was exercised in presenting the check in question for payment; and hence the learned court erred in directing a verdict for the defendant. There appears to be nothing in the case that requires extended comment.\nJudgment reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded."}
