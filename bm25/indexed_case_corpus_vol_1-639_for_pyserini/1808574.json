{"id": "1808574", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Superior Court which reversed a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of York County. Appellee\u2019s parental rights to her son, C.A.E., were terminated following the Orphans\u2019 Court\u2019s determination that Appellant York County Children and Youth Services (hereinafter YCCS) had shown by clear and convincing evidence that the factors listed in 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2511 were present in this case and that Appellee was incapable of caring for her son. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed, holding that YCCS had not established Appellee\u2019s incapacity by clear and convincing evidence. We hold that Superior Court exceeded its scope of review and, accordingly, reverse.\nAppellee\u2019s child was one of triplets born four months premature on September 17, 1982. Two of the triplets died shortly after birth. He suffered and continues to suffer from numerous medical problems. He remained in the hospital for almost fourteen months after birth and requires, and will continue to require, constant medical care. During the fourteen months C.A.E. was in the hospital, Appellee visited him infrequently and made no effort to learn to care for him.\nIn July 1983, YCCS filed a petition for custody with the Juvenile Division of the Court of Common Pleas of York County. The child was adjudged to be dependent, and his custody was awarded to YCCS for foster care. He remained in the hospital until December 1983, when he was released into the custody of foster parents.\nIn November 1984, Appellee revoked her previous consent to give C.A.E. up to foster parents. A number of hearings were held, at one of which the father\u2019s parental rights were terminated without opposition. Following the hearings, the Orphans\u2019 Court terminated Appellee\u2019s parental rights. Superior Court reversed.\nWe recently reaffirmed that the scope of appellate review where the Orphans\u2019 Court has involuntarily terminated a natural parent\u2019s right to a child is limited to the determination of whether the decree of termination is supported by competent evidence. See In re Adoption of Faith M., 509 Pa. 238, 240, 501 A.2d 1105, 1106 (1985), and cases cited therein. The burden is on the party seeking termination to show by \u201cclear and convincing\u201d evidence that grounds to terminate exist. Id., 509 Pa. at 240, 501 A.2d at 1106; In the Matter of the Adoption of G.T.M., 506 Pa. 44, 46, 483 A.2d 1355, 1356 (1984).\nThe Superior Court recognized the proper standard of review. We find, however, that Superior Court misapplied the standard \u2014 erroneously substituting its own independent interpretation of the facts as it perceived them to be from the record.\nThe statutory grounds upon which the Orphans\u2019 Court based its termination decree are found in 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2511(a)(2), (5). These sections provide:\n(a) General rule. \u2014 The rights of a parent in regard to a child may be terminated after a petition filed on any of the following grounds:\n(2) The repeated and continued incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal of the parent has caused the child to be without essential parental care, control or subsistence necessary for his physical or mental well-being and the conditions and causes of the incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal cannot or will not be remedied by the parent.\n(5) The child has been removed from the care of the parent by the court or under a voluntary agreement with an agency for a period of at least six months, the conditions which led to the removal or placement of the child continue to exist, the parent cannot or will not remedy those conditions within a reasonable period of time, the services or assistance reasonably available to the parent are not likely to remedy the conditions which led to the removal or placement of the child within a reasonable period of time and termination of the parental rights would best serve the needs and welfare of the child.\nIn finding that Appellant had met its burden of showing by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory grounds above were met, the Orphans\u2019 Court made numerous findings of fact. These facts, which are supported by the record, show the following:\nC.A.E. is a very small child, suffering from retarded physical development and many respiratory problems. He requires compulsive medical care, which a layperson may be trained to give with long-term, rigorous training. (N.T. 1/31/84, p. 51). His condition is such that any lower respiratory tract disease could be lethal. (N.T. 1/31/84, p. 50). Also, the child\u2019s condition will continue to be critical for at least several years of his life. (N.T. 1/31/84, p. 50).\nThe doctor who treated C.A.E. when he was born testified concerning the child\u2019s condition and about Appellee\u2019s capacity to care for the child. He opined that Appellee is incapable of caring for C.A.E., mainly because she was uncommitted to the fact that medical care would save the baby\u2019s life. (N.T. 1/31/84, p. 53). Appellee\u2019s psychotherapist also testified that he did not think Appellee was capable of giving the kind of care necessary for C.A.E.\u2019s survival. (N.T. 1/31/84, p. 70). He thought that Appellee\u2019s current pregnancy and the fact that she was soon going to regain custody of another child would put considerable stress on her and be too much for her to handle with C.A.E.\nEvidence showing that Appellee\u2019s visits to the hospital were infrequent, erratic and of short duration was presented. A hospital social worker testified that Appellee became frustrated when trying to feed the baby, had very little interaction with the baby and arrived at the hospital to visit unannounced numerous times. (N.T. 1/31/84, pp. 11, 28-9). A physician testified that Appellee had placed a pyramid shaped object with an eye in the center on the baby\u2019s crib, instructed the hospital to use eucalyptus leaves in treating the baby, and brought faith healers to the hospital to cure the child. (N.T. 1/31/84, pp. 46, 48).\nAppellee testified on her own behalf. She stated that her long absences from visiting the child were caused by her unstable emotional state, use of excessive medicine and trouble in her personal life. (N.T. 2/23/84, pp. 43, 45, 47-50). She testified that she is on her way to solving her problems and accepting her child. (N.T. 2/23/84, pp. 50-54).\nThe trial court\u2019s termination of Appellee\u2019s parental rights was predicated upon the fact that C.A.E. is in a precarious physical state and needs constant care and attention. The trial court found that Appellee is incapable of caring for the child and has deprived him of care necessary for his well-being. Since these conclusions were supported by the record, they should not have been disturbed.\nSuperior Court injected another factor into its decision by overturning a credibility determination of the lower court. Superior Court found that Appellee had the potential to develop skills to care for the child and that this was sufficient to prevent termination of parental rights. In the Matter of Adoption of Ellingsen, 348 Pa.Super. 169, 175, 501 A.2d 1123, 1127 (1985). It is clear, however, that the trial court found that history indicates that Appellee does not have the capacity to ever care for C.A.E. Appellee showed little interest in C.A.E. from the day he was born. Once a child has been placed in foster care, a parent has an \u201caffirmative duty to work towards the return of the child.\u201d In re Adoption of J.J., 511 Pa. 590, 515 A.2d 883, 890 (1986) (quoting In re: William L., 477 Pa. 322, 333, 383 A.2d 1228, 1233 (1978)). Appellee has done nothing to work toward that goal, other than to petition the court for custody, and make sporadic visits to the child. The only evidence presented that indicated that Appellee would be capable of caring for C.A.E. was Appellee\u2019s own testimony, which the trial court obviously regarded as incredible. To make a conclusion that Appellee would be capable of caring for the child, then, Superior Court erroneously disregarded the trial court\u2019s finding that Appellee\u2019s testimony was not credible.\nWe cannot say, from this record, that Appellee has made efforts to maintain any kind of parental interest in her son. The lower court did not abuse its discretion in terminating Appellee\u2019s parental rights, and we believe that this decision was made after careful consideration of the needs of the child.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed, and the order of the Court of Common Pleas of York County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, is reinstated.\nMcDERMOTT, J., concurred in the result.\nNIX, C.J., filed a dissenting opinion in which FLAHERTY, J., joined.\nFLAHERTY, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which NIX, C.J., joined.\n. The lower court pleadings contain the child\u2019s full name rather than his initials throughout these proceedings. We do not in any way condone the use of the child\u2019s name and accordingly have changed the name to initials in the caption and throughout the opinion.\n. Appellee named two different men as C.A.E.'s father on different occasions. It is not clear from the record who is the actual father, but neither opposed the termination of parental rights."}
