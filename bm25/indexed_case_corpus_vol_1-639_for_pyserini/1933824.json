{"id": "1933824", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThis is an appeal in a trespass action instituted in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia from an order granting appellee\u2019s motion to remove the judgment of non pros, taken by the appellant for failure of the appellee to file a complaint within twenty days after a rule was filed requiring appellee to do so or suffer judgment of non pros.\nThere is no dispute about the facts. The death of appellee\u2019s decedent on November 24, 1967, was allegedly caused by the malpractice of certain physicians and the negligence of appellant. A summons in trespass was filed November 15, 1968, and was served on appellant five days later. On March 11, 1969, counsel for the appellant wrote to appellee\u2019s counsel requesting him to file a complaint without the necessity of a formal rule. It was alleged and admitted that the following day appellant\u2019s counsel, by telephone, agreed to an extension of time in which to file a complaint because appellee\u2019s counsel, without the hospital records in the possession of the appellant, doubted the validity of this cause of action. Although these records were made fully available to appellee\u2019s counsel, no complaint was filed. On May 12, 1969, appellee\u2019s counsel was notified that a rule to file a complaint within twenty days or suffer a judgment of non pros, had been filed. After the expiration date of June 2, 1969, appellant\u2019s counsel notified appellee\u2019s counsel that a judgment of non pros, would be taken if the complaint was not promptly filed. A second warning was later given appellee\u2019s counsel indicating that a judgment of non pros, would be taken on July 2, 1969.\nNone of this correspondence was heeded and a judgment of non pros, was taken on July 7, 1969. Even after that date appellant\u2019s counsel, on July 8, 1969, graciously agreed not to oppose an opening of the judgment if a complaint was filed by July 15, 1969. No complaint having been filed, appellant\u2019s counsel closed its file and so informed appellee\u2019s counsel on August 28, 1969. Notwithstanding, appellee filed a complaint on September 23 1969, which was later returned by the Prothonotary as having been accepted in error. Thereafter, appellee\u2019s counsel petitioned to remove the judgment of non pros., which petition was granted by the court below following oral argument.\nThis Court has very definitely stated the criteria for opening a judgment of non pros. : \u201c(1) the petition should be timely filed; (2) the reason for the default reasonably explained or excused; and (3) that facts constituting grounds for a cause of action be alleged.\u201d Thorn v. Clearfield Borough, 420 Pa. 584, 586, 218 A. 2d, 298, 299 (1966). In this same vein, we have stated: \u201cA request to open a judgment of non pros, is by way of grace and not of right. Its grant or refusal is peculiarly a matter for the lower court\u2019s discretion.. An appellate court may not reverse the lower court\u2019s ruling unless ah abuse of discretion is' clearly evident: Brigham v. Eglin\u2019s of Phila., 406 Pa. 99, 176 A. 2d 404 (1962).\u201d Mazer v. Sargent Electric Co., 407 Pa. 169, 171, 180 A. 2d 63, 64 (1962).\nThe sole reason assigned by appellee\u2019s counsel\u2014accepted by the lower court\u2014as justification for the delayed filing was the alleged inability of counsel to discuss the matter with the appellee since both the appellee and his wife \u201cbecame emotionally upset when again confronted with a reminder of [their] daughter\u2019s death.\u201d However, a reading of the correspondence between counsel reveals that at no time was this difficulty ever mentioned. Furthermore, there is no medical or psychiatric evidence in the record supporting the otherwise bald allegation of appellee\u2019s counsel that appellee would be so distressed. Indeed, it is interesting to' note that such difficulty did not hamper the filing of complaints against the individual physicians involved.\nAnalogous to the procedure here involved is a defendant\u2019s petition to open a default judgment. In connection therewith, we have held that although defendant\u2019s counsel may be involved in other matters, the existence \u00f3f these obligations provides no excuse for opening\u2019 the judgment even though the client may he severely prejudiced. Walters v. Harleysville Mutual Cas. Co., 417 Pa. 438, 207 A. 2d 852 (1965). '\nWe are of the opinion that no reasonable explanation has been given for this inexcusable delay exceeding the bounds of generosity exhibited by appellant\u2019s counsel and that the lower court clearly abused its discretion.\nOrder reversed.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell and Mr. Justice Roberts took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nMr. Justice Cohen took no part in the decision of this case.\nSeparate actions were instituted against the individual physicians and were still listed for trial at the time of oral argument of this appeal.\nOriginally the petition sought to strike the judgment of non pros. However, it was amended at oral argument below, thereby avoiding the situation presented and discussed in Cox v. Felice Perri & Sons, 412 Pa. 415, 195 A. 2d 79 (1963). Like the lower court, we will treat the petition as one to open rather than strike the judgment of non pros. See, e.g., Whatley v. Baynard, 437 Pa. 498, 264 A. 2d 721 (1970) ; Mazer v. Sargent Electric Co., 407 Pa. 169, 180 A. 2d 63 (1962)."}
