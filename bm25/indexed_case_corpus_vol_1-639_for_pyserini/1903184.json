Fulton, his wife, appeal to this Court from a final judgment of the Court below in favor of plaintiffs Charles W. Mains and Ethel Mains, his wife, in declaratory judgment proceedings.\nOn July 1, 1960, the developers of an area known as Driftwood Acres in O\u2019Hara Township, Allegheny County, filed of record their plan for the development of that area. The plan shows the easement of a 30-foot right of way for the transmission lines of Duquesne Light Company, in part across the rear or northerly ends of six lots including part of defendants\u2019 property.\nIn June, 1964, plaintiffs contracted with Duquesne Light Company to relocate its lines so that thereafter they would occupy, inter alia, the 30-foot right of way which was partly over defendants\u2019 properly. When defendants refused Duquesne permission to erect its lines across their property and denied the legal existence of the right of way shown in the plan, Duquesne refused to proceed further in the relocation of its lines.\nPlaintiffs thereupon brought this declaratory judgment proceeding to determine whether or not in fact and in law Duquesne possessed the easement across defendants\u2019 property. Duquesne was named as one of the defendants in these proceedings. At the trial, the Court submitted six factual questions to the jury, and thereafter gave judgment for the plaintiffs.\nIn Sheldrake Estate, 416 Pa. 551, 207 A. 2d 802, the Court said (pages 553-554) : \u201c\u2018(1) While the grant of a petition for a declaratory judgment is a matter of sound judicial discretion: \u201cThis Court now adheres to the view that declaratory judgment proceedings must not be entertained if there exists another available and appropriate remedy, whether statutory or not: McWilliams v. McCabe, 406 Pa. 644, 179 A. 2d 222; State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Semple, 407 Pa. 572, 180 A. 2d 925.\u201d Lakeland Joint School District Authority v. Scott Township School District, 414 Pa. 451, 200 A. 2d 748.\n\u201c \u2018In State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Semple, 407 Pa., supra, the Court said (pages 574-575) : \u201cThe principles to guide the lower courts in determining whether or not a declaratory judgment proceeding should be entertained was recently clarified by this Court in McWilliams v. McCabe, 406 Pa. 644, 179 A. 2d 222 (1962). Therein we declared, inter alia, (1) that a declaratory judgment proceeding is not an optional substitute for established and available remedies; (2) that it should not be granted where a more appropriate remedy is available ; (3) that it should not be granted unless compelling and unusual circumstances exist; (4) that it should not be granted where there is a dispute of facts, or such controversy may arise; and (5) that it should not be granted unless there is a clear manifestation that the declaration sought will be a practical help in terminating the controversy.\u201d \u2019 \u201d\nMoreover, declaratory judgment proceedings will not lie unless all the parties having an interest in the issue are joined: Mohney Estate, 416 Pa. 107, 204 A. 2d 916; Carlsson v. Pa. General Ins. Co., 417 Pa. 356, 207 A. 2d 759; Bracken v. Duquesne E. & Mfg. Co., 419 Pa. 493, 215 A. 2d 623. In this case, as all the parties in interest were not joined, it is clear that a declaratory judgment proceeding will not lie.\nJudgment vacated.\nMr. Justice Cohen and Mr. Justice Roberts concur in the result.\nPlaintiffs could have proceeded by an action in equity or by an action at law to quiet title.\nEmphasis added in Sheldrake Estate Opinion.\nItalics, ours.\nCertainly all other owners in the development of Driftwood Acres had an interest and none were joined,"}
