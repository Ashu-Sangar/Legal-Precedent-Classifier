The judge\u2019s certificate is that \u201cthe amount involved in this proceeding exceeds the sum of $1,500,\u201d but that is not the test of jurisdiction. It is the sum in controversy in this particular suit, and that is $572, although the judgment for that sum may incidentally settle the right to future sums which will exceed $1,500."}
