{"id": "888326", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis case, \u2014 involving questions of fact which the jury alone-had the power to determine, \u2014 appears to have been carefully tried and fairly submitted to them with substantially accurate and adequate instructions. We find nothing in any of the fourteen specifications of which the defendant had just reason to complain; nor do we think that either of said specifications requires discussion.\nJudgment affirmed."}
