{"id": "891399", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe find nothing in either of the specifications of error that would justify a reversal or modification of the judgment. The Superior Court was clearly right in holding that the second proviso in the first section of the act of April 15, 1891, is unconstitutional and void. Its judgment is so fully vindicated in the opinion sent up with the record that it is unnecessary to add anything to the reasons therein given.\nJudgment affirmed."}
