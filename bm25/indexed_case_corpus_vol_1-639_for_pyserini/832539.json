{"id": "832539", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe are of opinion that the nonsuit was properly entered. The title to the real estate in question was in Alice E. Harvey, and there was nothing upon the face of it to show that Anderson Harvey, her husband, had any interest therein. The judgment and execution against the husband did not appear in the line of title. As Mrs. Harvey acquired the' property from a stranger, and not from or through her husband, there was nothing to put a purchaser upon notice.\nJudgment affirmed."}
