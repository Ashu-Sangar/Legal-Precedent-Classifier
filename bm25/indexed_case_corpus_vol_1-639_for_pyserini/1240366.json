{"id": "1240366", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nA review of the record reveals no error in the Chancellor\u2019s Adjudication Sur Account save the item covered by Defendant\u2019s Exception No. 2 which refers to the \u201cCourt\u2019s failure to deduct from the gross profits of the partnership the uncollectible accounts receivable.\u201d In its final Opinion the learned lower court accepted the correctness of this Exception to the extent of permitting one-half of $363.60, representing the accounts receivable which had become uncollectible prior to the date of dissolution, to be deducted from the amount to be paid plaintiff by defendant, thus reducing this amount from $3,071.50 to $2,889.70. We agree that this was in accordance with the facts and the law applicable thereto.\nWe also agree that defendant wus not entitled to any compensation for services in operating the partnership business after plaintiff withdrew from active participation. Generally speaking, a partner is not entitled to compensation for services in performing partnership matters or in winding up its affairs. A right to compensation arises only where the services rendered extend beyond normal partnership functions: Bracht v. Connell, 313 Pa. 397, 404, 170 A. 297, 300; Herman v. Pepper, 317 Pa. 349, 352, 176 A. 201, 202. The facts of this case quite clearly demonstrate that the services in question were only those necessary to the successful operation of an existing partnership, and therefore no compensation for the performance of such services could properly be claimed.\nThe final decree, therefore, is affirmed on the Opinion and Order filed by the court en banc.\nDecree affirmed. Costs to be paid by Appellant."}
