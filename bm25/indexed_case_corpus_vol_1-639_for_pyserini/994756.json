{"id": "994756", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nThe legal questions involved in this appeal are substantially the same as in Brock v. Steel Company, ante, p. 249,\nThe testator here gave his trustees a power of sale but expressly excluded the Cornwall ore banks, his language being, \u201c but not to make any sales of the principal which I forbid,\u201d and the power to sell being limited to his estate \u201c other than Cornwall ore banks.\u201d As said in Brock v. Steel Company there is no express prohibition of sale by order of court and it would have been ineffectual if there had been. For the reasons set forth in the opinion in that case the decree is affirmed."}
