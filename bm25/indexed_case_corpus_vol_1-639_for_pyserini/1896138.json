Equitable Trust Co., 215 Pa. 413, 417, 64 Atl. 591, 592 (1906), or clear agreement by the parties, Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company v. Philadelphia Transportation Company, 404 Pa. 541, 548, 173 A. 2d 109, 113 (1961), or some other established exception, see Hempstead v. Meadville Theological School, 286 Pa. 493, 134 Atl. 103 (1926).\u201d Corace v. Balint, 418 Pa. 262, 271, 210 A. 2d 882, 886-7 (1965). Appellees contend that a statute supports the allowance of counsel fees in this case. Section 516 of the Business Corporation Law, added by the Act of August 27, 1963, P. L. 1355, \u00a71, 15 P.S. \u00a72852-516, to the Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, 15 P.S. \u00a72852-1 et seq., provides, inter alia: \u201cB. In any such [derivative] suit instituted or maintained by a holder or holders of less than five per centum of the outstanding shares of any class of such corporation . . . unless the shares . . . held by such holder or holders have a fair market value in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($50,-000), the corporation in whose right such action is brought shall be entitled at any stage of the proceedings, to require the plaintiff or plaintiffs to give security for the reasonable expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, which may be incurred by it in connection with snch suit, and by the other parties defendant in connection therewith, for which it may become liable pursuant to subsection C of this section 516, to which security the corporation shall have recourse in such amount as the court having jurisdiction shall determine upon the termination of such action.\n\u201cC. The reasonable expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, of any party defendant incurred in connection with the successful defense of such suit shall be assessed upon the corporation. . . . The amount of all such expenses so assessed shall he awarded as costs of the suit and be recoverable in the same manner as statutory taxable costs. . . .\u201d\nPlaintiff-appellant owns more than five per centum of the outstanding shares of the defendant-appellee corporation. Accordingly, the corporation could not have required plaintiff to put up the security provided for in \u00a7516B. However, appellees contend that \u00a7516B is merely a method by which the corporation may secure and recover from a financially insecure plaintiff its own litigation expenses and those assessed against it under \u00a7516C. On the other hand, they contend that \u00a75160, especially the last quoted sentence thereof, provides that a corporation may recover all such expenses from a losing plaintiff, irrespective of the size of latter\u2019s interest in the corporation. The argument must fail because it is not in accord with the language or the purposes of \u00a7516.\nSection 516C is derived from, and as material to this case is identical to, the now repealed \u00a73 of the Act of April 18, 1945, P. L. 253, 12 P.S. \u00a71323. The latter was, in turn, based upon \u00a761-a of the New York General Corporation Law, added by N.Y. Laws 1941 c.350. The purpose of \u00a75160 and its precursors is \u201cto encourage capable and responsible persons to become officers and directors and to reduce the hazard of an honest director\u2019s bearing personally the heavy expense of defending a suit.\u201d Hornstein, Directors\u2019 Expenses In Stockholders\u2019 Suits, 43 Colum. L. Rev. 301 (1943). Under \u00a7516C, this objective is attained by shifting the expenses of successful individual defendants to the corporation not to the losing plaintiff. With respect to the like provision of the New York General Corporation Law, the Court of Appeals of that State held: \u201cThe effect of that statute was to impose upon the eorpora tion the burden of paying the reasonable expenses . . . incurred by an officer or director who successfully defended himself against a charge of wrong to the corporation. No additional burden was imposed by the statute upon any individual plaintiff or defendant.\u201d (Emphasis partially supplied). Shielcrawt v. Moffett, 294 N.Y. 180, 61 N.E. 2d 435, 438 (1945). See also, Hornstein, Directors\u2019 Expenses In Stockholders\u2019 Suits, supra; Reader, Suits Against Corporations, 12 P.S. \u00a7\u00a71221 to 1820, page 8 (1953). That part of \u00a7516C which directs that the expenses \u201cso assessed [against the corporation] shall be awarded as costs . . . and be recoverable in the same manner as statutory taxable costs . . . .\u201d merely provides the method by which the successful defendants recover from the corporation the amounts assessed against it. Hornstein, Directors\u2019 Expenses In Stockholders\u2019 Suits, supra, at pp. 304-305; Cf. Reader, Suits Against Corporations, supra. Accordingly, \u00a7516C in no way established a right in the corporation to recover from an unsuccessful plaintiff the \u201creasonable expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d directly incurred by the corporation or assessed against it under \u00a7516C in the type of shareholder\u2019s derivative action regulated by \u00a7516.\nSection 516B, on the other hand, does permit such recovery \u2014 but only under the circumstances provided therein, viz., when the plaintiff or plaintiffs hold \u201cless than five per centum of the outstanding shares of any class of such corporation . . . unless the shares . . . have a fair market value in excess of fifty thousand dollars . . .\u201d and the corporation requires the plaintiff or plaintiffs to give security for such expenses. Section 516B was derived from, and as material to this case is identical to, the now repealed \u00a72 of the Act of April 18, 1945, P. L. 253, as amended, 12 P.S. \u00a71322. The latter was, in turn, based upon \u00a761-b of the New York General Corporation Law, added by N. Y. Laws 1944, c. 668. The purpose of \u00a7516B and its precursors is to prevent \u201cstrike suits\u201d \u2014 shareholder derivative actions begun \u201cwith the hope of winning large attorney\u2019s fees or private settlements, and with no intention of benefiting the corporation on behalf of which suit is theoretically brought.\u201d Security For Expenses Legislation \u2014 Summary, Analysis, and Critique, 52 Colum. L. Bev. 267 (1952). See also Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 547-549 (1949). It was thought that such \u201cstrike suits\u201d were usually brought by shareholders with only a small financial-stake in the corporation and who, therefore, had little to lose by starting an action. However, it also was recognized, as Mr. Justice Jackson observed in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., supra, at p. 548, that the shareholder\u2019s derivative suit is a \u201cremedy born of stockholder helplessness . . . long the chief regulator of corporate management and has afforded no small incentive to avoid at least grosser forms of betrayal of stockholders\u2019 interests.\u201d Consistent with this background, the New York \u201csecurity for expenses\u201d legislation, followed by Pennsylvania and now embodied in \u00a7516B, was not intended to discourage derivative actions generally, a result which would follow if appellees were to prevail, but only to prevent \u201cabuses attending the maintenance of such actions by persons whose financial stake in the corporation is slight.\u201d Isensee v. Long Island Motion Picture Co., 54 N.Y.S. 2d 556, 559 (1945). Accordingly, the deterring burden of providing security from which the corporation may be reimbursed was imposed \u201conly upon unsuccessful plaintiffs . . . who hold less than five percent of the stock of the corporation unless their shares have a market value in excess of $50,000\u201d. Id., at pp. 559-560, and not upon plaintiffs with an interest above that prescribed in \u00a7516B.\nThus, because \u00a75160 does not provide a right in the corporation to recover \u201creasonable expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d from an unsuccessful plaintiff, and because the corporation can recover such expenses under \u00a7516B only by having recourse to the security provided for therein, and because the plaintiff here had not been and could not be required to give such security, it necessarily follows that \u00a7516 does not support recovery of such expenses or fees from this plaintiff.\nAppellees further contend that Pa. R. C. P. 2230(b), requiring approval of court before a voluntary nonsuit may be entered in a class action, gives the court the power to condition its approval as it did in the present case. Not only is this a non sequitur but also it overlooks the very different and inapposite purpose of Pa. R. C. P. 2230(b) which is to protect nonjoined members of the class from prejudicial and binding action by their representative. 3 Goodrich-Amram \u00a72230(b)-l. Moreover, we would not unnecessarily construe a Rule of Civil Procedure in a way which would make it contradict an express statute on the same subject.\nAppellees have failed to show any basis for the allowance of counsel fees as part of the \u201ccosts\u201d that plaintiff may be required to pay under Pa. R. C. P. 231(a) and 1523 if he commences his suit anew. Accordingly, that part of the order which allows counsel fees must be vacated.\nOrder as modified affirmed. Costs on appellees.\nSubsection A of \u00a7516 sets forth the type of derivative suit regulated by the section: \u201c. . . any suit brought to enforce a secondary right on the part of one or more shareholders against any officer, or director, or former officer or director of a corporation, domestic or foreign, because such corporation refuses to enforce rights which may properly be asserted by it, , ,\nWhen \u00a7516 was put into the Business Corporation Law in August of 1963 the Act of April 18, 1945, P. L. 253, as amended, was repealed. See Act of August 27, 1963, \u00a72(36). Plaintiff instituted his suit before the repeal of the 1945 Act but the lower court\u2019s orders, which purportedly relied on that Act, was entered after its repeal. However, since \u00a7516 is identical to the Act of 1945 in respects material to the issue before us wo need not determine which of the Acts should have been applied by the lower court.\nIt provided: \u201cThe reasonable expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, of any party defendant incurred in connection with the successful defense of such suit shall be assessed upon the corporation, or if any party defendant shall be successful in part only, or if such action shall be settled with the approval of the court having jurisdiction thereof, the reasonable costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees, of any such party defendant shall be assessed upon the corporation in such amount as the court shall determine and find to be reasonable in the circumstances. The amount of all such expenses so assessed shall be awarded as costs of the suit and be recoverable in the same manner as statutory taxable costs.\u201d\nIt provided: \u201cIn any action, suit or proceeding against one or more officers or directors, or former officers or directors, of a corporation . . . brought in its behalf ... by one or more stockholders . . . the reasonable expenses, including attorneys fees, of any party plaintiff or party defendant incurred in connection with the successful prosecution or defense of such action . . . shall be assessed upon the corporation . . .; and the amount of all such expenses so assessed shall be awarded as special costs of the action, suit or proceeding and recoverable in the same manner as statutory taxable costs.\u201d\nIt provided: \u201cIn any such suit instituted or maintained by holder or holders of less than five per centum of the outstanding shares of auy class of such corporation\u2019s stock . . . the corporation in whose right such action is brought shall be entitled, at any stage of the proceedings, to require the plaintiff or plaintiffs to give security for the reasonable expenses, including attorneys\u2019 fees, which may be incurred by it in connection with such suit, and by the other parties defendant in connection therewith, for which it may become liable pursuant to section three of this act, to which security the corporation shall have recourse in such amount as the court having jurisdiction shall determine upon the termination of such action.\u201d\nIt provided: \u201cIn any action instituted or maintained in the right of any . . . corporation by the holder or holders of less than five per centum of the outstanding shares of any class of such corporation\u2019s stock . . . unless the shares . . . held . . . have a market value in excess of fifty thousand dollars, the corporation in whose right such action is brought shall be entitled at any stage of the proceedings before final judgment to require the plaintiff or plaintiffs to give security for the reasonable expenses, including attorney\u2019s fees, which may be incurred by it in connection with such action and by other parties defendant in connection therewith for which it may become subject pursuant to [\u00a761-a] of this chapter, to which the corporation shall have recourse in such amount as the court having jurisdiction shall determine upon the termination of such action.\u201d\nTlie general discussion of the \u201csecurity for expenses\u201d or \u201canti-strike suit\u201d provisions in the following authorities leave no doubt about the matter: Lapchak v. Baker, 298 N.Y. 89, 80 N.E. 2d 751 (1948); Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., supra; Murdock v. Follansbee Steel Corp., 213 F. 2d 570 (3d Cir. 1954); Security For Expenses Legislation \u2014 Summary, Analysis, and Critique, supra; Hornstein, New Aspects of Stockholders\u2019 Derivative Suits, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 1 (1947) ; Reader, Suits Against Corporations, sura, at p. 7. Indeed, it was this very disparity of treatment, based on the size of the stockholders\u2019 interest, that grounded an unsuccessful attack on the constitutionality of New Jersey's \u201csecurity for expenses\u201d provision in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., supra."}
