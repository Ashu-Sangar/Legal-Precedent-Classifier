{"id": "1100738", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nThe Commonwealth appeals from the order vacating Tyrone Moore\u2019s death sentence and granting him a new penalty hearing under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. Moore cross-appeals from the denial of his remaining claims for relief under the PCRA.\nIn 1988, a jury found Moore guilty of first degree murder, conspiracy, robbery, theft by unlawful taking, and recklessly endangering another person. At the penalty hearing, the jury found two aggravating circumstances, no mitigating circumstances, and fixed the penalty for the murder at death. This Court affirmed on direct appeal. Commonwealth v. Moore, 534 Pa. 527, 633 A.2d 1119 (1993), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1114, 115 S.Ct. 908, 130 L.Ed.2d 790 (1995).\nMoore filed a timely PCRA petition, in which his principal claim was appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to present on direct appeal relevant facts showing trial counsel should have presented mitigating evidence during the penalty phase. He raised thirteen other issues as well.\nThe PCRA court held a hearing solely on the issue of appellate counsel\u2019s failure to proffer the mitigating evidence trial counsel should have presented at the penalty phase. The court concluded appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to present such evidence; it reversed the death sentence and remanded for a new penalty hearing. The court did not address Moore\u2019s remaining issues, which were deemed denied without a hearing. This appeal followed.\nIn reviewing an order granting or denying post conviction relief, we examine whether the PCRA court\u2019s determination is supported by the evidence and whether it is free of legal error. Commonwealth v. Williams, 557 Pa. 207, 732 A.2d 1167, 1176 (1999). To be entitled to relief under the PCRA, Moore must show, as to each claim, that \u201cthe allegation of error has not been previously litigated or waived,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(3), and that \u201cthe failure to litigate the issue prior to or during trial, during unitary review or on direct appeal could not have been the result of any rational, strategic or tactical decision by counsel.\u201d Id., \u00a7 9543(a)(4). An issue is previously litigated if \u201cthe highest appellate court in which the petitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue....\u201d Id., \u00a7 9544(a)(2).\nThe record reveals issues 1, 2, 5, 7, 10, and 11, as well as portions of issues 6 and 9, have been previously litigated. \u201c[P]ost-conviction review of claims previously litigated on appeal cannot be obtained by alleging ineffective assistance of prior counsel and by presenting new theories of relief to support previously litigated claims.\u201d Commonwealth v. Peterkin, 538 Pa. 455, 649 A.2d 121, 123 (1994); Commonwealth v. Bracey, 568 Pa. 264, 795 A.2d 935, 939 n. 2 (2001) (same); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(3). Moore\u2019s arguments for these issues are nothing but retooled versions of his arguments on direct appeal; as such, they are previously litigated and he is not entitled relief.\nMoore\u2019s remaining issues assert trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness during the guilt and penalty phases, as well as appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to raise these issues on direct appeal. Any alleged error during the guilt and penalty phases has been waived because of trial counsel\u2019s failure to raise it; Moore may still obtain relief for trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness if he can show appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue the claims. See Commonwealth v. Rush, 576 Pa. 3, 838 A.2d 651, 656 (2003) (citing Commonwealth v. McGill, 574 Pa. 574, 832 A.2d 1014, 1022 (2003) (when court is faced with \u201clayered\u201d ineffectiveness claim, only viable ineffectiveness claim is that related to most recent counsel, appellate counsel)).\nWe set forth the standard for preserving \u201clayered\u201d ineffectiveness claims in McGill and Rush:\nIn order to preserve a claim of ineffectiveness, a petitioner must \u201cplead, in his PCRA petition,\u201d that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise all prior counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Additionally, a petitioner must \u201cpresent argument on, i.e. develop each prong of the [Commonwealth v.] Pierce [, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987)] test\u201d as to appellate counsel\u2019s deficient representation. \u201cThen, and only then, has the petitioner preserved a layered claim of ineffectiveness for the court to review; then, and only then, can the court proceed to determine whether the petitioner has proved his layered claim.\u201d\nRush, at 656 (citations and footnote omitted); see also McGill, at 1021-23.\nThe \u201cPierce test\u201d requires Moore to prove, with respect to appellate counsel\u2019s performance, that: (1) the underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness has arguable merit; (2) appellate counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to pursue the claim; and (3) but for appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, the result on direct appeal would have differed. See McGill, at 1022-23. This \u201cperformance and prejudice\u201d test was first enunciated in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and was recognized in Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987), as the proper test under the Pennsylvania Constitution. Failure to address any prong of the test will defeat an ineffectiveness claim. Basemore, at 738 n. 23 (citing Rollins, at 441) (ordinarily, post conviction claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may be denied by showing petitioner\u2019s evidence fails to meet single one of three prongs for claim).\nMoore has met the pleading requirement for his remaining issues, as he alleged the ineffectiveness of both trial and appellate counsel in his PCRA petition, as well as in his appellate brief. He also presents argument concerning his underlying claims of trial error and trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, satisfying the first prong of Pierce with respect to appellate counsel. However, he fails to develop the remaining two prongs concerning appellate counsel\u2019s stewardship; thus, he has failed to preserve his claims of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness as required by McGill.\nIn cases where the appellant has established the arguable merit of his underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, remand may be warranted for the opportunity to correct his deficient pleading of the remaining two prongs regarding appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Rush, at 657. \u201cNevertheless, there is simply no need to remand a PCRA petition when the petitioner has not carried his Pierce burden in relation to the underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, since even if the petitioner were able to craft a perfectly layered argument in support of his claim, the petitioner\u2019s claim would not entitle him to relief.\u201d Id., at 657-58, 838 A.2d 651. Thus, we need not remand if Moore has not met his burden of proving the underlying trial counsel ineffectiveness.\nMoore\u2019s first claim regarding the guilt phase is that the prosecutor improperly argued the jury could find specific intent to commit murder based on Moore\u2019s participation in the robbery, even if Moore had not been the shooter. In closing, the prosecutor stated:\n[L]et\u2019s say [Moore] did everything that [co-conspirator] Ricardo Scott said he did, except fire the shot. Under those circumstances, ladies and gentlemen, if the Commonwealth has established beyond a reasonable doubt that he was there, that Tyrone Moore in fact participated in the robbery, that he was part of this plan, then I submit to you we have already found him guilty of the crimes charged beyond a reasonable doubt. It is not necessary for the Commonwealth to establish Mr. Moore as the shooter to find him guilty of murder. That is not the law.\nN.T. Trial, 9/12/83, at 645.\nMoore argues both trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to challenge this error; however, there was nothing improper about the prosecutor\u2019s statement in the context in which it was made. Moore was charged generally with criminal homicide; he could have been found guilty of second or third degree murder, not just first degree murder. The prosecutor was merely explaining how the jury could find Moore guilty of second degree murder; he went on to argue that the evidence established Moore was the shooter, so the jury could find him guilty of first degree murder. See id., at 645-47. The trial court instructed the jury concerning all levels of criminal homicide and clearly stated that to convict Moore of first degree murder, they had to find he had killed the victim and that he had done so with specific intent. Id., at 661-67. Accordingly, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s statement. As this claim is meritless, Moore\u2019s claim of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is necessarily defeated as well. McGill, at 1023. Therefore, we need not remand to review the remaining two prongs of Pierce with respect to appellate counsel. See Rush, at 657-58; McGill, at 1025.\nIn his second guilt phase issue, Moore alleges the Commonwealth failed to disclose exculpatory evidence, in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963). Specifically, he claims the Commonwealth coerced the false testimony of two witnesses, intimidated another witness into not testifying, paid witnesses for their testimony, and failed to reveal the extent of the incentives offered in one witness\u2019s plea agreement. While other evidence may have been helpful to Moore\u2019s case, in the end, none of this evidence as alleged tends to prove Moore\u2019s innocence of the crime; Moore only attempts to smear the Commonwealth\u2019s case by these averments of misconduct. The PCRA court rejected these claims without a hearing, and we perceive no abuse of discretion in its doing so. Accordingly, neither trial nor appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to raise this issue, McGill, at 1023, and remand for further development of it is unnecessary. Rush, at 657-58; McGill, at 1025.\nMoore next alleges various errors during jury selection. Moore claims the trial court improperly sustained an objection to defense counsel\u2019s attempt to ask a prospective juror whether she had been in the company of people who expressed an opinion about Moore\u2019s guilt. However, the record reveals this juror stated she had no fixed opinion concerning Moore\u2019s guilt or innocence, she would be able to keep an open mind and make a determination only after having heard all of the evidence, and she was not prejudiced against Moore because of his race. N.T. Voir Dire, 9/12/83, at 7-10. Accordingly, Moore was not prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s ruling, or the manner in which voir dire of this juror was conducted; therefore, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge the court\u2019s ruling.\nMoore claims trial counsel should have \u201clife qualified\u201d the jury. However, \u201calthough such questions are permissible, they are not required and counsel is not ineffective for failing to pose them.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hardcastle, 549 Pa. 450, 701 A.2d 541, 543 (1997) (citing Commonwealth v. Blount, 538 Pa. 156, 647 A.2d 199 (1994)). This claim is meritless.\nMoore claims trial counsel was ineffective for not attempting to rehabilitate a juror who the Commonwealth challenged for cause because she stated she could not impose the death penalty. However, Moore does not allege that but for counsel\u2019s failure to rehabilitate this juror, the result at trial would have differed. Having failed to demonstrate prejudice, Moore is not now entitled to relief.\nMoore claims trial counsel should not have accepted jurors whose answers revealed potential bias; he alleges the racial bias of one juror, and points to the fact that another juror had a family member in law enforcement and a third juror\u2019s family member had been the victim of a crime. However, the one juror\u2019s reference to the fact he had a \u201ccolored\u201d gentleman for a roommate does not amount to racial bias; the juror offered this fact as support for his statement that the races of the victim and Moore would have no effect on him. N.T. Voir Dire, 9/12/88, at 83. The juror whose brother was a police officer stated that fact would not influence her decision, id., at 111, and the juror whose brother had been a crime victim said she did not think it would prevent her from being fair and impartial. Id., at 140. Trial counsel cannot be said to be ineffective for accepting these jurors. As none of Moore\u2019s claims regarding trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in connection with jury selection entitle him to relief, his claims of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness fail, see McGill, at 1023, and there is no need to remand. Rush, at 657-58; McGill, at 1025.\nMoore\u2019s final guilt phase issue cumulatively alleges various errors and omissions by trial counsel: failing to impeach two witnesses with prior inconsistent statements, failing to investigate the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged coercion of these witnesses and intimidation of another witness, failing to call a co-conspirator as a witness, failing to object to testimony which inaccurately suggested a certain witness had identified Moore, conceding the strength of the prosecution\u2019s identification evidence, and failing to impeach a witness with crimen falsi convictions and the extent of the incentives in his plea agreement. The claims concerning counsel\u2019s failure to impeach witnesses, as well as the failure to investigate the alleged intimidation and coercion of witnesses, are retooled versions of Moore\u2019s unsuccessful Brady claims. The remaining allegations of trial counsel\u2019s error do not rise to the level of prejudice requiring reversal of Moore\u2019s conviction; he fails to demonstrate the result at trial would have differed but for counsel\u2019s performance. Because Moore is not entitled to relief on his claim concerning trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, his claim of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness fails, McGill, at 1023, and remand is unnecessary. Rush, at 657-58; McGill, at 1025.\nWith respect to the penalty phase, the Commonwealth alleges the issue of trial counsel\u2019s failure to present mitigating evidence was previously litigated on direct appeal, and therefore the PCRA court erred in granting Moore relief on this claim.\nOn direct appeal, Moore alleged trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence, but appellate counsel was unable to specify what that evidence was. Instead, counsel requested an evidentiary hearing as an investigative tool, to establish what mitigating evidence could have been presented. This Court denied counsel\u2019s request, and concluded trial counsel was not ineffective:\n[MJuch of appellant\u2019s argument improperly refers to information outside the record. To the extent that appellant finds support in the record for his arguments, such support is clearly insufficient to support a finding of ineffectiveness. Rather, the record clearly reveals that appellant received zealous and competent representation throughout these proceedings under the circumstances.\nPresumably, counsel would likely be found ineffective in an instance where they failed to obtain evidence in mitigation reasonably available or failed to conduct a reasonable investigation. In such an instance, it would be readily apparent that counsel were just going through the motions during the penalty phase, especially where no evidence in mitigation is presented.... [SJuch is not the case here.\nObviously, just as there are cases where evidence in mitigation exists, there are those instances where no evidence in mitigation exists or is obtainable by reasonable means. Thus, the mere fact that [Moore\u2019s] trial counsel presented no specific evidence in mitigation does not render their performance ineffective.... [TJhe record reveals that defense counsel made substantial efforts on appellant\u2019s behalf in this case, and they cannot be faulted for the lack of available mitigating evidence given the circumstances present, which included the failure of any member of appellant\u2019s own family to appear after being served with subpoenas. Trial counsel made zealous argument in mitigation of appellant\u2019s crime during the penalty phase given the limited evidence in mitigation, and appellant fails to advise this Court what mitigating evidence could have been offered.\nMoore, at 1134-35 (emphasis added).\nBecause appellate counsel did not specify what evidence could have been offered, this Court could not conclude on the record before it, that trial counsel was ineffective. Thus, the issue of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness was addressed on direct appeal.\nBefore the PCRA court, Moore argued appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to supplement the record to include what was missing\u2014the mitigating evidence available at the time of trial. Thus, Moore\u2019s claim is not the traditional \u201clayered\u201d ineffectiveness claim where the underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness has been waived and only exists in relation to the \u201cmerit prong\u201d regarding appellate counsel\u2019s performance. Rather, the claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness was decided adversely to Moore, and he now contends appellate counsel was ineffective in this regard. In other words, Moore alleges, but for appellate counsel\u2019s failure to advise this Court of what mitigating evidence trial counsel should have presented, he would have prevailed on his claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. As such, the claim of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness was not previously litigated.\nHaving concluded Moore\u2019s claim was properly before the PCRA court, we must determine whether he has established all three prongs of the Pierce test regarding counsel\u2019s performance. Complicating this matter, appellate counsel, who was the first counsel to represent Moore after trial counsel, was obliged to raise trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness on direct appeal, see Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687 (1977) (ineffectiveness claims must be raised at time defendant gets new counsel, or they are waived), even though there was no record of what mitigating evidence was available to trial counsel. Appellate counsel did not have the benefit of this Court\u2019s ruling in Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726 (2002) (overruling Hubbard to extent it requires trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness be raised at time when petitioner obtains new counsel; petitioner should wait to raise claims of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness until collateral review). Therefore, in order to preserve the issue of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, appellate counsel had to raise it on direct appeal; however, as the PCRA court noted, he did not point to any evidence outside the record which trial counsel should have offered.\nOn collateral review, although the PCRA court did not have the benefit of this Court\u2019s decision in Grant, its decision did what Grant sought to achieve; it heard testimony concerning the evidence actually available to trial counsel, heard testimony from both trial and appellate counsel, made credibility determinations, and assessed trial counsel\u2019s stewardship under the three Pierce prongs. This is indeed the better practice, since \u201cthe role of an appellate counsel is to review the record for claims of error, but not necessarily to uncover extra-record claims.... \u2018[B]ecause there is no constitutional requirement for appellate counsel to search outside the record for error, an ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim that is in substance a trial counsel claim requiring extrinsic evidence may be dead on arrival.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 736-37 (quoting Woods v. State, 701 N.E.2d 1208, 1222 (Ind.1998)). Accordingly, we turn to the PCRA court\u2019s review of Moore\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence.\nIt is well settled that failure to present mitigation evidence, without more, is not ineffective assistance per se. Commonwealth v. Beasley, 544 Pa. 554, 678 A.2d 773, 778 (1996) (citing Commonwealth v. Yarris, 519 Pa. 571, 549 A.2d 513, 531 (1988)). At the penalty phase, trial counsel told the court at sidebar that, after discussion with counsel, Moore did not wish to testify concerning mitigating circumstances. N.T. Trial, 9/12/83, at 713. Counsel also stated he was unaware of where Moore\u2019s then-wife was, Moore\u2019s sister was no longer present in the court room, and he -had not heard from any of Moore\u2019s family or friends. Id. Thus, counsel concluded, \u201cWe have really nothing to offer by way of opening or argument evidence, just closing argument.\u201d Id. During closing, defense counsel argued, \u201cthere may be mitigating circumstances in this case ...,\u201d id., at 723, but did not detail what these might have been.\nAt the PCRA hearing, Moore\u2019s mother, sister, and ex-wife testified concerning Moore\u2019s traumatic and abusive childhood, including witnessing his father slash his mother\u2019s throat. While this may or may not be perceived as mitigating (one juror might see this as reason for sympathy; another might see it as assuring Moore his violence permanently ingrained in him), the reason it was not provided was not strategic, and we cannot disagree with the PCRA court\u2019s determination that the jury should have been given this.\nThese witnesses further testified they would have testified at the penalty phase. The PCRA hearing brought to light the fact Moore\u2019s mother was not subpoenaed, but that she would have testified at the penalty phase, had trial counsel explained to her the proceeding and the significance of her testimony. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/25/00, at 472-86. Moore\u2019s sister, although not subpoenaed, was present at trial; however, she was not told prior to trial that she might be needed to testify. Id., at 494. Trial counsel did not approach her until a recess during the guilt phase, and never explained to her that she would be needed for the penalty phase which would begin the next day. Id., at 498-500. Consequently, she left at the end of the guilt phase, unaware of the nature of the penalty phase and the need for her testimony. Id., at 500-06, 509-11. Moore\u2019s ex-wife was subpoenaed to present alibi testimony at the guilt phase, but did not appear. Id., at 516-17, 525, 535. However, trial counsel never told her she could testify at the penalty phase or explained the nature of the proceeding to her. Id., at 518, 521-22. She testified that, although she \u201chad [her] reasons,\u201d id., at 530, for not giving alibi testimony at the guilt phase, she would have given mitigating testimony at the penalty phase, had the proceeding and the significance of her testimony been explained to her. Id., at 524, 526, 531-34.\nThese witnesses were obviously more cooperative in 2000 than in 1983, and we sympathize with trial counsel\u2019s frustration with them. However, the PCRA court found these witnesses credible, PCRA Court Opinion, 9/22/00, at 9, and we will not disturb its determination as fact finder. See Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, 553 Pa. 485, 720 A.2d 79, 93-94 (1998) (this Court is bound by PCRA court\u2019s credibility determinations where there is record support for those determinations).\nThus, the record from the PCRA hearing reveals: (1) these witnesses existed; (2) they were available to testify at the penalty phase; (3) trial counsel knew of their existence; (4) they were prepared to cooperate and would have testified at the penalty phase; and (5) the absence of their testimony prejudiced Moore. See Commonwealth v. Crawley, 541 Pa. 408, 663 A.2d 676, 679-80 (1995) (test for ineffectiveness for failure to present witnesses). Mitigating evidence is a crucial part of the penalty phase, and trial counsel\u2019s failure to present any evidence, particularly in the face of the two aggravating circumstances presented by the Commonwealth, was not to the benefit of Moore. As the PCRA court noted, Moore was an uncooperative client, but not to an extent that relieved trial counsel of the duty to investigate potential mitigating evidence, particularly where counsel had no other penalty phase strategy. Cf. Commonwealth v. Williams, J-99-2000 (failure to investigate and present psychiatric mitigating evidence was not ineffectiveness where counsel\u2019s strategy was to portray defendant as good son and athlete, although strategy was unsuccessful).\nUnder the circumstances in this case, presenting no mitigating evidence, when such evidence was arguably available, was not a reasonable tactic. Without any mitigating evidence before the jury, Moore\u2019s only chance at receiving a life sentence would have been if the jury did not find either of the aggravating circumstances proven. This was not likely, given the factual basis for them shown in the evidence presented by the Commonwealth; therefore, the absence of any mitigating evidence prejudiced Moore. As the PCRA court noted:\n[E]vidence could have been presented during the penalty phase which would have established for consideration by the jury, that Moore\u2019s life was traumatic, abusive, neglectful, cruel, and harmful to his emotional development. The record established Moore was abused by his alcoholic father, he witnessed his mother receive beatings and when he attempted to protect his mother as a young child, he himself was beaten. He witnessed his father slash his mother\u2019s throat and after this event he lived in fear and became withdrawn. Testimony also revealed Moore was neglected and he had various physical ailments that were not cared for. It was evident from the testimony presented that Moore\u2019s childhood was one of constant trauma, fear, and terror. Clearly, this [c]ourt finds this type of evidence constitutes mitigating evidence and further finds it should have been presented to the jury and not having done so was prejudicial to Moore. Obviously, this is the type of evidence that demonstrates a reasonable probability that a different result could have occurred at Moore\u2019s capital penalty phase trial.\nPCRA Court Opinion, 9/22/00, at 9. Accordingly, the grant of a new penalty phase hearing is proper in this case.\nHaving concluded the PCRA court did not err in ruling Moore is entitled to a new penalty hearing, we need not address the remainder of his penalty phase issues. See Commonwealth v. Cuevas, 574 Pa. 409, 832 A.2d 388, 396 n. 3 (2003) (citing Commonwealth v. Merchant, 528 Pa. 161, 595 A.2d 1135, 1139 (1991)) (where capital case is remanded for new penalty hearing, remaining penalty phase issues are rendered moot and need not be addressed).\nAccordingly, the PCRA court\u2019s order granting Moore a new penalty hearing is affirmed, and the denial of relief on his remaining issues is affirmed.\nOrder affirmed; case remanded. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which Justices NIGRO and BAER join.\n. Moore committed the killing while perpetrating a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6), and in the commission of the offense Moore knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim, id., \u00a7 9711(d)(7).\n. Moore's other issues were:\n1. Whether Moore\u2019s rights under the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments were violated when, although made aware of a conflict between Moore and defense counsel, the trial court failed to hold a hearing and permitted the trial to proceed with conflicted counsel.\n2. Whether Moore\u2019s appearance at trial branded him with an unmistakable mark of guilt in violation of the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n3. Whether the prosecutor improperly argued the jury could find specific intent to commit first degree murder based on a finding of participation in the robbery, and the court failed to correct this error.\n4. Whether Moore\u2019s death sentence must be vacated because the sentencing jury was never instructed that, if sentenced to life, Moore would be ineligible for parole.\n5. Whether the jury\u2019s sentencing verdict is ambiguous as to the aggravating circumstance or circumstances found, rendering the verdict unreliable and depriving Moore of meaningful appellate review, in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n6. Whether defense counsel conceded a nonexistent aggravating circumstance; told the jury that if sentenced to death, Moore would not commit any more robberies or murders; told the jury that the case would be appealed; and failed to argue any mitigating circumstances, constituting an ineffective closing argument at the penalty phase.\n7. Whether the trial court failed to take protective measures to combat the pervasive, inflammatory publicity about this case, and counsel were ineffective for failing to renew their motion for change of venue, in violation of the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n8. Whether relief is appropriate because of error under Brady v. Maryland and related errors.\n9. Whether Moore is entitled to relief from his death sentence because the jury imposed death based on its finding of the nonstatutory aggravating circumstance of \"reckless endangerment\u201d and because the statutory \"grave risk of death to another\" aggravating factor is vague and overbroad in violation of the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n10. Whether the death sentence was unconstitutionally infected by nonstatutory aggravation regarding Moore\u2019s prior convictions.\n11. Whether the trial court\u2019s penalty phase instruction that the jury\u2019s verdict must be unanimous was misleading and coerced the jury to return a death verdict, in violation of the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.\n12. Whether Moore was denied his rights under the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments when the trial court impermissibly restricted voir dire, and trial counsel were ineffective for failing to rehabilitate a juror challenged by the Commonwealth, failing to life qualify jurors, and accepting biased jurors.\n13. Whether errors and omissions on the part of defense counsel during the guilt phase denied Moore his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, as guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.\nMoore\u2019s Brief, at 2-3.\n. An assessment of this prong requires Moore to establish each Pierce prong with respect to trial counsel\u2019s performance; failure to establish any one of the prongs will defeat the entire claim. Commonwealth v. Basemore, 560 Pa. 258, 744 A.2d 717, 738 n. 23 (2000) (citing Commonwealth v. Rollins, 558 Pa. 532, 738 A.2d 435, 441 (1999)). This \"merit\u201d prong has been referred to as containing a \"nested\u201d argument\u2014trial counsel's performance must be addressed in order to determine whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. See Rush, at 656.\n. \"[W]hen a court is faced with a \u2018layered\u2019 claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the only viable ineffectiveness claim is that related to the most recent counsel, appellate counsel.\u201d Rush, at 656. See also McGill, at 1022 (defining traditional \"layered ineffectiveness\u201d: only claim of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness that PCRA counsel may raise is that of appellate counsel's ineffectiveness for failing to raise, on direct appeal, claim of trial counsel's ineffectiveness).\n. This situation is distinguishable from one where ineffectiveness is alleged and a new theory is presented in support of a previously litigated claim. See Peterkin, at 123. Moore\u2019s claim is based on the fact there was no mitigating evidence presented at the penally phase; therefore, this issue does not rest solely upon previously litigated evidence. See Commonwealth v. Miller, 746 A.2d 592, 602 nn. 9 & 10 (Pa.2000) (where claim involving evidence involves other previously unchallenged evidence, claim was not previously litigated and merits will be reached).\n. Although the PCRA court concluded \"appellate counsel was ineffective in not following proper appellate procedure which would have allowed the Supreme Court to consider matters outside the record ...,\" PCRA Court Opinion, 9/22/00, at 4, the court did not conduct the \u201cperformance and prejudice\" analysis mandated by Pierce with respect to appellate counsel. However, in light of the evidence produced at the PCRA hearing and the PCRA court\u2019s conclusions based on this evidence, we need not remand for further analysis of appellate counsel's stewardship.\n. Trial counsels\u2019 testimony at the PCRA hearing was unfortunately but understandably equivocal, at best, about whether they had attempted to contact or interview these witnesses, and whether they explained mitigating circumstances to Moore 18 years before. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/25/00, at 19, 31, 33-35, 37-38, 40-41, 60-61, 71-72, 90-92, 100-101, 106-107, 115-116, 132-33.\n. Cf. Commonwealth v. Williams, 577 Pa. 473, 846 A.2d 105 (2004) (no relief due, where PCRA court did not find witnesses credible concerning appellant's claim of trial counsel's ineffectiveness for failing to investigate, develop, and present significant mitigating evidence).\n. Issue 4, and the portions of issues 6 and 9 not previously litigated."}
