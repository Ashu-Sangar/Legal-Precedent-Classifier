{"id": "1776254", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Superior Court affirming a decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County which directed appellants Wells Fargo Land and Mortgage Co. and Northeastern National Land Co. (Wells Fargo) to construct a theatre building pursuant to a lease agreement with appellee Easton Theatres, Inc. Because Wells Fargo has complied with the decree, we dismiss the appeal as moot.\nThe parties\u2019 agreement permitted appellee to seek financing for the construction project, provided that a mortgage be obtained \u201cwith the leased premises as the only security.\u201d Appellee obtained an offer of a loan from the Continental Bank, \u201cevidenced by the bond or note of your companies secured by a first mortgage.\u201d Wells Fargo rejected the offer without first seeking to determine whether the requirement of a bond or note had been intended to impose personal liability or merely to afford procedural advantages to the lender in the event of default.\nAppellee instituted the present proceedings upon Wells Fargo\u2019s refusal to accept the proposed financing. On October 17,1978, the court of common pleas directed Wells Fargo to commence construction of a theatre building within thirty days or post a supersedeas bond in the amount of $200,000. Wells Fargo then appealed to the Superior Court, but did not file a bond or seek an alternate stay. See Pa.R.A.P. 1732. While the appeal was pending, appellee sought to have Wells Fargo held in contempt for its noncompliance with the decree. On December 11, 1978, the court of common pleas denied appellee\u2019s request, concluding \u201cthat it is not in the best interest of either side for construction to commence pending appeal ... [and] that a supersedeas bond is the least burdensome remedy.\u201d Nonetheless, Wells Fargo continued to refuse to file a bond or begin construction.\nOn May 7,1979, after the Superior Court had affirmed the decree of specific performance, the court of common pleas found Wells Fargo in contempt. The Superior Court denied Wells Fargo\u2019s petition to stay the order of contempt, and at some time thereafter construction was commenced. The theatre building has been open for business since December 21, 1979.\nDespite its compliance with the decree, Wells Fargo seeks a reversal of the decree on the theory that it acted properly in summarily rejecting the Continental offer. Wells Fargo also seeks a remand of the record for the fashioning of additional \u201cappropriate relief.\u201d Presumably the latter request for relief reflects Wells Fargo\u2019s belief that it has been harmed by its having to construct the theatre at 1979 prices, instead of prices in effect in 1973, when the building was to have been built.\nWe are not persuaded that either request for relief can survive in the face of Wells Fargo\u2019s compliance with the court\u2019s decree. \u201cOrdinarily, a party who consents to, or acquiesces in, a judgment or order cannot appeal therefrom.\u201d 9 Standard Pennsylvania Practice Ch. 38, \u00a7 162, pp. 134-35. See Brown v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Health, 495 Pa. 456, 434 A.2d 1179 (1981); Reese v. Adamson, 276 Pa. 253, 119 A. 920 (1923). Here, Wells Fargo was given every opportunity by the court of common pleas to maintain the status quo while its appeal was pending. Nevertheless, Wells Fargo chose to ignore the orders of the court of common pleas until, as a result of its own willful inaction, it had to begin construction of the theatre building or face enforcement of the contempt citation. In these circumstances, equity manifestly requires that Wells Fargo be held responsible for the consequences of its conduct and that its appeal be dismissed as moot. Appeal dismissed. Each party to pay own costs.\nFLAHERTY, J., files a dissenting opinion, in which McDermott, j., joins;-\n. This case was reassigned to this writer on June 11, 1982.\n. See Ladner, Conveyancing in Pennsylvania \u00a7\u00a7 12.01, 12.14 (4th ed. 1979).\n. Wells Fargo has, of course, overlooked the fact that the Increase in the construction price has resulted in a correspondingly greater return on Wells Fargo\u2019s investment. To the extent that the building constructed in 1979 is worth more, Wells Fargo receives a proportionately greater tax advantage in depreciating the building over its useful life. See Kaczkowski v. Bolubasz, 491 Pa. 561, 421 A.2d 1027 (1980) (rejecting practice of discounting awards for future lost earnings to present value in favor of \u201ctotal offset\u201d approach which recognizes effect of inflation in depreciating value of dollar).\nThe question of whether appellee Easton Theatres in fact suffered a compensable loss as a result of the delay was not addressed by the Chancellor and remains to be decided. 265 Pa.Super. 334, 352, 401 A.2d 1333, 1343 (1979).\n. We perceive no basis for addressing the merits of the controversy on a theory that collateral estoppel would be asserted to prevent Wells Fargo from initiating any future civil action against Easton Theatres. The only determination of the Superior Court from which Wells Fargo has chosen to appeal is that relating to the decree of specific performance. Wells Fargo has not challenged the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that Wells Fargo\u2019s breach of the lease agreement may entitle Easton to recover lost profits. See supra note 2. Thus, any possibility of collateral estoppel arising from a dismissal of this appeal is a possibility of Wells Fargo\u2019s own making, and may not influence this Court\u2019s decision on whether to address the issue of specific performance long after the theatre has been built. See Pa.R.A.P. 2116. See also Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114 (1974)."}
