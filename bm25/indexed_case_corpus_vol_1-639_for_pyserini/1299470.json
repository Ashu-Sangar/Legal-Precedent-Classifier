{"id": "1299470", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Boic,\nJudgment on a single bill was entered by confession in Philadelphia County on March 9, 1955, against defendants. On March 15, 1955, the record of this judgment was exemplified and entered in Delaware County.\nOn February 5, 1960, a petition to open the judgment was filed in Delaware County, and, after hearing, an order was made, dated July 15, 1960, opening the judgment and letting the defendants in to a defense. The plaintiff appealed.\nThe matter before the Delaware County court was coram non judice, under the Act of April 16, 1840, P. L. 410, 12 PS \u00a7891. It had power over the judgment only for purposes of lien, revivals and execution, but had no power to inquire into the merits of the controversy. That was for the original judgment court alone.\nIn First National Bank & Trust Co. of Bethlehem v. Laubach, 333 Pa. 344 (1939), 5 A. 2d 139, we said: \u201cSection 1 of the Act of April 16, 1840, P. L. 410, (\u2018construed\u2019 by section 11 of the Act of April.16, 1845, P. L. 538), provides for the transfer of judgments from one court of common pleas to another, and that \u2018as to lien, revivals, executions, and so forth,\u2019 the transferred judgment \u2018shall have the same force and effect, and no other,\u2019 as if the judgment had been entered originally in the court to which the transfer was made. It is to be noted that this act is entitled \u2018An Act Belating to Executions, . . .\u2019 and it does not undertake to deal with a transferred judgment other than for purposes of realizing thereon. Such a transferred judgment is merely \u2018a quasi judgment, and that too only for limited purposes\u2019: Brandt\u2019s Appeal, 16 Pa. 343, 346. It has been held time and again that the court of tbe county to which the judgment is transferred has no power over it except for purposes of execution, and cannot inquire into its merits. That can be done only by the court in which it was originally obtained: King v. Nimick, 34 Pa. 297; Mellon v. Guthrie, 51 Pa. 116; Beck v. Church, 113 Pa. 200; Nelson v. Guffey, 131 Pa. 273; Lehigh & New England R. R. Co. v. Hanhauser, 222 Pa. 248; Shotts & Co. v. Agnew & Barnett, 81 Pa. Superior Ct. 458, 461.\u201d\nTo the same effect are Banning v. Taylor, 24 Pa. 297 (1855), and Williams v. VanKemp, 370 Pa. 359 (1952), 88 A. 2d 49.\nThe order is reversed, costs on the defendant."}
