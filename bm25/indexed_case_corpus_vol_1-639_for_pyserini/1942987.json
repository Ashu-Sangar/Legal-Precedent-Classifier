{"id": "1942987", "contents": "Opinion\nPee Cueiam,\nAfter an altercation between John Pushkarsh (appellant) and one Michael Pizzichetti, each filed complaints against the other charging assault and battery before different magistrates. A hearing on appellant\u2019s complaint was conducted and Pizzichetti was bound over for action by the grand jury. Prior to any hearing on Pizzichetti\u2019s cross-complaint, appellant filed an \u201capplication to enjoin further proceedings\u201d in the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County. After argument, the court below refused to enjoin the proceedings on Pizzichetti\u2019s complaint before the second magistrate and this appeal followed.\nSince this criminal matter is not directly appealable to this Court, Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P. L. 673, \u00a7202, 17 P.S. \u00a7211.202 (Supp. 1971), and no petition for plenary jurisdiction was filed, the matter is transferred under \u00a7503 (b) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act to the Superior Court, which has jurisdiction under \u00a7302 of said Act. There is no merit to appellant\u2019s argument that jurisdiction is conferred upon this Court by Article V, \u00a710(a) and (c) of the Constitution of this Commonwealth. In this manner we do not reach the questions of whether the instant appeal is interlocutory and, if so, whether \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d exist which justify appellate review. See, e.g., Com. v. Heckathorn, 423 Pa. 626, 225 A. 2d 227 (1967); Com. v. Haushalter, 423 Pa. 351, 223 A. 2d 726 (1966).\nThe appeal is transferred to the Superior Court."}
