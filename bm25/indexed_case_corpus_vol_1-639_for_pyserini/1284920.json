{"id": "1284920", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nMary Boreth, appellant, filed an application for a use registration permit to operate a beauty shop in the basement of her premises. The application was refused and the zoning board, after a public hearing, also refused to issue the permit to her. Thereafter, she took an appeal to the court of common pleas contending that the operation of her beauty shop is a \u201chome occupation\u201d as that term is defined in the Philadelphia ordinance. From an order dismissing her appeal, she took the present appeal.\nThe appellant is co-owner, with her husband, of premises 1247 Levick Street, Philadelphia, which is located in an area zoned \u201cD\u201d Residential under the zoning regulations. However, a beauty shop is not a permitted use under the regulations set forth in Section 14-207 (1) of the Philadelphia Code of General Ordinances.\nDespite this, appellant seeks to avail herself of Section 14-216, which provides for accessory uses that are permitted in residential districts. She contends that a beauty shop is a \u201chome occupation\u201d as that phrase is defined in Section 14-102(17) : \u201cAny lawful occupation customarily conducted in a dwelling as an incidental use.\u201d\nIn Gold v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, 393 Pa. 401, 143 A. 2d 59 (1958), we held that a one-chair barber shop conducted in the basement of premises located in a \u201cD\u201d Residential District in Philadelphia was not a \u201chome occupation\u201d and, therefore, was not permitted as an accessory use. What Mr. Justice Arnold said there at pp. 403, 404 is particularly appropriate to the instant case: \u201cWhether this is a use \u2018customarily conducted\u2019 in a dwelling as an incidental use has not heretofore been determined by this Court. It is to be noted that the use must not only be \u2018incidental\u2019 to, but must also be \u2018customarily conducted\u2019 in, a dwelling. Thus, that it might be incidental to his living in the home is not sufficient, and merely because he would have only one chair, operate only by appointment, or display no signs, would not determine the matter. A practical and sensible approach to the question leaves no doubt that this is not a customary use of a dwelling, such as sewing or cooking might be. Barbering is a commercial use, and not ordinarily or customarily conducted in a home. It is a business ordinarily conducted in a business shop or building.\u201d\nThe appellant seeks to avoid the impact of that decision by attempting to display factual distinctions applicable to beauty shops as contradistinguished to barber shops. She also urges the similarity between beauty culture and homemaking, millinery work, dressmaking, and sewing as home occupations customarily conducted in a home. These distinctions are not sufficient to merit the abandonment of our decision in the Q-old case, supra.\nBeauty culture treatment today has become an extensive operation in relation to the type of equipment, accouterments, and quarters necessary for this type of enterprise. The operators now have at their disposal a multitude of dyes, lotions, hair dressing preparations and complicated electrical machinery which have characterized this as a commercial operation and not one that is \u201ccustomarily conducted in a dwelling.\u201d Very recently, this Court dealt with State Beauty Culture Law, Act of May 3, 1933, P. L. 242, as amended, 63 P.S. \u00a7507 et seq., in the case of Department of Licenses and Inspections v. Weber, 394 Pa. 466, 147 A. 2d 326 (1959) and held that the beauticians must comply with both state and city requirements in the operation of their beauty salons. A review of the Philadelphia Code, \u00a76-402, et seq, and the Beauty Culture Law discloses an intention on behalf of the State Legislature and the Philadelphia City Council to deal with these operations as commercial activities and not as \u201chome occupations.\u201d For example, Section 14 of the Beauty Culture Law, Act of May 3, 1933, P. L. 242, as amended, 63 P.S. \u00a7520, provides that any room used wholly or in part for a beauty shop cannot be used for residential purposes. In view of this, it is scarcely arguable that this comprises an incidental use that is ordinarily conducted in a home. Moreover, the Philadelphia Code in Section 14-303 (1) (S) specifically provides for the establishment of beauty parlors in \u201cA\u201d Commercial Districts. It appears inconceivable that the legislators intended that this use also be permitted in \u201cD\u201d Residential Districts. Cf. Bonasi v. Haverford Township Board of Adjustment, 382 Pa. 307, 115 A. 2d 225 (1955). Moreover, to hold that there is a distinction between barber shops and beauty parlors in view of their essential commercial characteristics is to indulge in gossamer-like distinctions that would do violence to the zoning regulations.\nWe are here faced with the duty of interpreting the ordinance as written and to use the legislative dictionary set up in this ordinance. See Sterling v. Philadelphia,, 378 Pa. 538, 106 A. 2d 793 (1954). Even though, after reviewing the record, we deplore the manner in which one of the neighboring protestante sought to stifle the appellant from competing against him under the guise of enforcing the zoning regulations, we must conclude that beauty shops are not \u201chome occupations\u201d within the meaning of the ordinance and the refusal to grant the use registration permit was proper.\nOrder affirmed."}
