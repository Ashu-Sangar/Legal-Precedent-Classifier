{"id": "1904981", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Roberts,\nThis is an appeal from the action of the court below sustaining preliminary objections of appellee, the Philadelphia Housing Authority and dismissing the complaint.\nAppellant, Ruth M. Faden, brought suit in her capacity as a taxpayer of the City of Philadelphia against the Philadelphia Housing Authority, seeking to set aside a contract between the Authority and H. Gold, Inc., a contractor, and for such other relief as would be just and equitable. The gravamen of her complaint was that the contract in question, which was for the replacement and conversion of coal-fired boilers at an Authority housing project, had not been awarded to the lowest responsible bidder as mandated by the Housing Authorities Law, Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 955, \u00a711, as amended, 35 P.S. \u00a71551.\nThe Authority filed preliminary objections to the complaint, alleging, inter alia, that a taxpayer lacked standing to challenge Authority action since no tax funds were directly involved. The objections were sustained on this ground and the complaint dismissed. This appeal followed.\nApproximately three months subsequent to the filing of the appeal the Authority moved this Court to dismiss the appeal under Supreme Court Rule 41, on the ground that the controlling question had become moot. In support of its motion, the Authority alleged that all work to be performed under the contract had been completed, thus dissolving the controversy and precluding equity from granting the requested relief.\nIn her answer to this motion, appellant asserted that she was without sufficient knowledge or information to form a belief as to the truth of the Authority\u2019s allegations and that all means of proof thereof were in the exclusive control of the Authority. The allegations were therefore denied and proof demanded.\nThis Court is of the opinion that the motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the controlling question had become moot must be denied. Appellee has failed to support its allegations by depositions, as required by Supreme Court Rule 41 when such allegations are controverted. In these circumstances, it would be necessary to receive proof of the allegations contained in the Authority\u2019s motion before it can be ruled on, a task for -which the court below is far better equipped than this Court.\nMore importantly, even assuming the correctness of appellee\u2019s averment that the work on the furnaces has been completed, this does not moot this litigation. Appellant\u2019s prayer for relief in the court below did not seek only to restrain the defendant contractor from performing its duties under the contract, it also sought to restrain the defendant Philadelphia Housing Authority from performing its duties and in addition \u201csuch other and further relief as may be deemed just and reasonable.\u201d Thus it may be that appellant is still entitled to restrain the Housing Authority from making some part or all payment to the appellee-contractor, cf. Yoder v. Luzerne Township School District, 399 Pa. 425, 160 A. 2d 419 (1960); Philadelphia Co. v. Pittsburgh, 253 Pa. 147, 97 Atl. 1083 (1916) or if payment has been made, that some other relief in the nature of restitution of moneys to the Housing Authority may be available to appellant. By saying this we in no way intimate any view as to the type of relief, if any, which could appropriately be granted by the court below in this case; all we do say is that, absent any argument by appellant showing why such further relief is not available, this Court cannot say that completion of performance renders this case moot.\nWe turn, therefore, to the sole issue raised by this appeal: whether appellant, as a resident and taxpayer of the City and School District of Philadelphia, has standing to institute an action in equity against the Philadelphia Housing Authority.\nThis Court has recently struggled with the concept of standing as it affects the right of a taxpayer to maintain a suit against a public body. See, e.g., Price v. Philadelphia Parking Authority, 422 Pa. 317, 221 A. 2d 138 (1966); White v. Philadelphia, 408 Pa. 397, 184 A. 2d 266 (1962); Loewen v. Shapiro, 389 Pa. 610, 133 A. 2d 525 (1957). And although many reasons have been advanced for granting standing to taxpayers, the fundamental reason for granting standing is simply that otherwise a large body of governmental activity would be unchallengeable in the courts. Note, Taxpayers\u2019 Suits: A Survey and Summary, 69 Yale L.J. 895, 904 (1960). Moreover, it has been recognized that \u201cthe availability of such litigation is insurance against the instances in which responsible prosecutors, usually political officers, are themselves allied with the action challenged or are overly burdened to identify and rectify every . . . illegal practice.\u201d Id. at 911; see also Jaffe, Standing To Secure Judicial Review: Public Actions, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 1265, 1280, 1282 (1961).\nYet the reasons for permitting taxpayer litigation involving nonauthority governmental bodies seem to be forgotten when applied to suits brought against public authorities. Rather than recognize the fact that public policy favors judicial review of the statutory and constitutional validity of the acts of public bodies and officials, courts too often require strict compliance with the traditional requirements, developed long before the advent of the public authorities, that the taxpayer establish a direct pecuniary loss. Merely because a governmental unit has chosen to perform its public functions through an authority rather than directly affords no basis for granting such an authority greater immunity from taxpayer challenge than the body which created the authority. Nor does a rule permitting taxpayers to challenge in court the conduct of public authorities create the possibility that public functions will be unduly disrupted by the groundless legal challenges of isolated individuals. The courts\u2019 proven ability to deal effectively with such challenges to governmental bodies receiving direct tax support can just as easily be employed to protect public authorities receiving indirect tax support. Cf. Schade v. Allegheny County Inst. Dist., 386 Pa. 507, 511, 126 A. 2d 911, 913 (1956).\nThis Court has recently recognized the need to subject the activities of public authorities to judicial scrutiny. In Price v. Philadelphia Parking Authority, 422 Pa. 317, 329, 221 A. 2d 138, 145 (1966), the Court stated: \u201cAs public bodies, . . . [authorities] exercise public powers and must act strictly within their legislative mandates. Moreover, they stand in a fiduciary relationship to the public which they are created to serve and their conduct must be guided by good faith and sound judgment. See Schwartz v. Urban Redevelopment Auth., 411 Pa. 530, 536, 192 A. 2d 371, 374 (1963); Heilig Bros. Co. Inc. v. Kohler, 366 Pa. 72, 77-78, 76 A. 2d 613, 616 (1950). The mushrooming of authorities at all levels of government and the frequent complaint that such bodies act in an arbitrary and capricious manner in violation of existing law dictate that a check rein be kept upon them. Schwartz v. Urban Redevelopment Auth., 411 Pa. 530, 536, 192 A. 2d 371, 374 (1963); Keystone Raceway Corp. v. State Harness Racing Comm., 405 Pa. 1, 5, 173 A. 2d 97, 99 (1961). These considerations dictate that the independence of authorities from some of the usual restrictions on governmental activity not be extended so as to insulate them from judicial scrutiny through the medium of taxpayers\u2019 suits.\u201d (Emphasis supplied; footnotes omitted.)\nThe authority in the instant case is \u201ca public body, corporate and politic, exercising public powers of the Commonwealth . . . .\u201d Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 955, \u00a710, 35 P.S. \u00a71550. Its property is exempt from most taxes. Ibid, \u00a723, 35 P.S. \u00a71563. To the extent that the activity of the Philadelphia Housing Authority creates tax exempt property, which benefits from the provision of municipal services it would seem that the taxpayer has a pecuniary interest in seeing that its functions are not improperly conducted. Cf. Price v. Philadelphia Parking Auth., supra at 325-27, 221 A. 2d at 143-44. Moreover the Philadelphia Housing Authority is empowered to agree to make payment to the City of Philadelphia in lieu of taxes for \u201cimprovements, services, and facilities\u201d, so long as such payments do not exceed the cost thereof to the City, Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 955, \u00a723, 35 P.S. \u00a71563, and that such an agreement has in fact been made. This fact emphasizes the taxpayers\u2019 interest in the operation of the Housing Authority, since the misuse of funds jeopardizes the Authority\u2019s ability to make the agreed upon payments \u201cin lieu of taxes.\u201d\nAppellees urge that White v. Philadelphia, 408 Pa. 397, 184 A. 2d 266 (1962), in which we rejected a taxpayer\u2019s claimed standing to enjoin the City, School District and Housing Authority of Philadelphia from enforcing an ordinance empowering the Authority to purchase and rehabilitate selected non-contiguous properties precludes us from finding standing here. We believe, however, that this Court\u2019s broadened philosophy of standing outlined a few months ago in Price v. Philadelphia Parking Authority, supra, supersedes White and that a denial of standing to appellant Faden here would be in conflict with the Price philosophy. We therefore overrule White insofar as it is inconsistent with the decision here.\nMuch the same reasoning we have used to deal with the appellees\u2019 reliance on White applies equally to their reliance on Loewen v. Shapiro, 389 Pa. 610, 133 A. 2d 525 (1957), although it should be noted that ground of the Loewen Court\u2019s denial of standing is somewhat distinguishable from those urged here, as is attested by the fact that the author of the White opinion dissented to that portion of Loewen dealing with standing.\nUnder these circumstances, we are compelled to conclude that the taxpayer in the present case has standing to challenge the action of the Philadelphia Housing Authority and that the chancellor erred in sustaining the preliminary objections of the Authority.\nDecree of the court below dismissing the complaint is reversed and the record remanded for further proceedings consistent herewith. Each party pay own costs.\nThe papers filed by appellees do not make clear whether their mootness claim is based solely on the averment that the contractor has completed his work or whether the mootness claim is also based on the claim that the Housing Authority has made payment and thus completed its performance under the contract.\nAll that appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal alleges with reference to completion of performance is: \u201c5. Since the filing of the appeal the Appellee, H. Gold, Inc. has fully performed the said contract which appellant seeks to enjoin; and the conversion and replacement of the boilers at the aforesaid project from coal to gas fired has been accomplished. 6. As a result of the completion of performance of said contract an actual controversy in this case does not exist and the Court could not grant the Appellant the relief requested in her Complaint.\u201d While it is true that appellee\u2019s brief (filed subsequently to its motion to dismiss) contains the statement that: \u201cAll performance under the contract which Appellant seeks to enjoin has been completed.\u201d we feel the phrasing of this statement, without more, does not in the circumstances clearly enough suggest that appeUee\u2019s mootness claim is based on payment by the Housing Authority.\n\u201cAt any time prior to that herein fixed for the filing and service of the Brief of appellee, he may move ... to dismiss . . . because the controlling question has, for any reason, become moot. ... A copy of the motions, and papers attached thereto, shall be filed in this Court and served on the opposite party, who may reply within five days after service thereof. Matters averred in either motion or answer, which do not appear of record, must be sustained by an affidavit of the truth thereof, and, if controverted, must be supported by depositions.\u201d\nWe are also precluded from mooting this appeal by the fact that it was the unilateral action of appellees that brought about the conditions upon which the mootness claim is based. A defendant to a suit in equity may not oust a Court\u2019s jurisdiction merely by performing an act sought to be enjoined.\nCompare Mayer v. Hemphill, 411 Pa. 1, 190 A. 2d 444 (1963)."}
