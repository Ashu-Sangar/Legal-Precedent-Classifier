{"id": "875937", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThere was no error in making the decrees referred to in the first specification, nor in dismissing the exceptions to the master\u2019s report recited in the third specification. The questions involved in the assignments of error, so far as they are material, have been so fully considered by the learned master that we deem it unnecessary to add anything to what he has said.\nThe decree is affirmed on his report, and the appeal is dismissed with costs to be paid by the defendant."}
