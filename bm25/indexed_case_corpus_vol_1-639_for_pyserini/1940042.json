{"id": "1940042", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Robebts,\nThis appeal arises out of a contest over a will which was executed by Abraham Cohen, M.D., on December 31, 1968, while he was a patient in the Abington Memorial Hospital. This will was duly admitted to probate, and Letters Testamentary were granted thereon. On December 10, 1970, the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, after hearing, dismissed the appeal of Dr. Richard W. Cohen, the testator\u2019s only child, from the Register\u2019s decree. This appeal followed.\nAppellant contends that his father\u2019s will should be denied probate. He alleges that the testator did not have testamentary capacity at the time he signed the will. In addition, he alleges that the testator did not intend to make the disposition of his estate which the will of December 31,1968, would effect. After a careful review of the record, we reject both of appellant\u2019s contentions and affirm the decree of the orphans\u2019 court.\nPreliminarily we should note that in reviewing the decision of the orphans\u2019 court, our task is to assure that the record is free from legal error and to determine if the chancellor\u2019s findings are supported by competent and adequate evidence, and are not predicated upon capricious disbelief of competent and credible evidence. See, e.g., Holtz Will, 422 Pa. 540, 544, 222 A. 2d 885, 888 (1966); Hunter Will, 416 Pa. 127, 136, 205 A. 2d 97, 103 (1964).\nTbe record establishes that on June 11, 1968, testator, a physician, prepared for himself a will which in essence divided his estate equally between his wife and his son. On the evening of December 29, 1968, testator had his wife drive him to the Abington Memorial Hospital. There testator, a member of Abington Memorial\u2019s staff, was placed in the hospital\u2019s coronary care unit.\nOn the evening of December 31, 1968, I. Jerome Stem, Esq., brought to the hospital a new will which he had prepared at testator\u2019s request. This will contained a bequest to testator\u2019s wife in the amount of the maximum marital deduction, and created a residuary trust whose income was to be distributed to testator\u2019s wife. The will was signed that evening. Testator was released from the hospital on January 29,1969, and died less than three months later on April 18, 1969.\nAppellant urges that testator lacked testamentary capacity at the time he executed the December 31,1968, instrument. We have long held that once the execution of a will is proved by the required two witnesses, as it was here, a \u201cpresumption of testamentary capacity\u201d arises which can only be overcome by \u201cclear, strong, and compelling evidence.\u201d Brantlinger Will, 418 Pa. 236, 242, 210 A. 2d 246, 250 (1965). We agree with the orphans\u2019 court that appellant has failed to sustain his burden of proving that testator lacked testamentary capacity.\nAppellant produced two witnesses on the issue of testamentary capacity. Dr. Roderick Kitchell, testator\u2019s attending cardiologist, admitted that at the time of testator\u2019s hospitalization he was \u201cnot particularly-interested\u201d in testator\u2019s mental condition. When asked for his opinion of testator\u2019s competency on December 31, 1968, the most that Dr. Kitchell could state was: \u201cI would say that his judgment was not of the best.\u201d\nAppellant\u2019s other witness, Dr. Bernard L. Segal, had never examined or even seen testator. Nevertheless, Dr. Segal testified that on the basis of the hospital records it was his opinion that testator \u201ccould not have possessed full testamentary capacity\u201d. However, Dr. Se-gal\u2019s testimony was subsequently rebutted by Dr. Theodore Bodman, a cardiologist who testified from the hospital records on behalf of the proponents of the will.\nProponents, on the other hand, presented a great deal of convincing evidence of testator\u2019s capacity. Betty J. Kerling, a nurse at Abington Memorial Hospital and one of the subscribing witnesses to the contested will, testified that testator knew that he was signing a will that had been prepared previously. The testimony of Attorney Stem indicated that testator was alert and fully aware of what he was doing when he signed the challenged will. Testator\u2019s widow testfied that on December 31, 1968, her husband\u2019s memory and judgment were unimpaired. Furthermore, proponents produced check stubs which indicated that testator, on December 31, 1968, wrote several checks in payment of his home mortgage and office rentals. Such evidence is particularly relevant in view of our oft-repeated holding that \u201ctestamentary capacity need not rise to the level required to conduct business affairs.\u201d Brantlinger Will, supra, at 248, 210 A. 2d at 253.\nAppellant\u2019s second contention is that testator did not intend to adopt the testamentary scheme set forth in the will of December 31, 1968. Appellant is correct in his assertion that if the December 31, 1968, will is to be admitted to probate, testator must have had knowledge of the contents of that will. Blume v. Hartman, 115 Pa. 32, 39, 8 Atl. 219, 222 (1887); see 1 BoweParker: Page on Wills, \u00a75.8. For a will is defined as \u201c 'the legal declaration of a man\u2019s intentions, which he wills to be performed after his death\u2019 . . .\u201d Sciutti Estate, 371 Pa. 536, 539, 92 A. 2d 188, 189 (1952) (quoting Blackstone). And if a decedent had no knowledge of the contents of a document purportng to be his will, it cannot be said that such a document is a declaration of that decedent\u2019s intentions.\nAlthough proof of execution of a will raises the presumption that testator had knowledge of its contents, Spence\u2019s Estate, 258 Pa. 542, 547, 102 Atl. 212, 214 (1917); Frew v. Clarke, 80 Pa. 170, 180 (1876), proponents did not merely rely on this presumption. Instead, although Attorney Stem admitted that testator never read the will which he signed on December 31, 1968, either on that date or subsequently, Attorney Stern did testify that he prepared the probated will in accordance with testator\u2019s express instructions that he wanted to leave his entire estate to his wife. Furthermore, Attorney Stern testified that when he visited testator in the hospital on December 31, 1968, he explained the provisions of the probated will to testator. In order to counter Stem\u2019s testimony, appellant and a Sol Berman testified that testator indicated subsequent to December 31, 1968, that he wanted to divide his assets equally between his wife and his son. However, after reviewing all this testimony, we cannot say that the chancellor\u2019s finding that testator had knowledge of the contents of the December 31, 1968, will was erroneous.\nAccordingly, the decree of the orphans\u2019 court is affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell and Mr. Justice Pomeboy took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nWe have consistently held that the test for testamentary capacity is whether the testator, at the time he executed the will in question, had an intelligent knowledge regarding the natural objects of his bounty, of what his estate consists, and of what he desires done with his estate, even though his memory has been impaired by age or disease. See, e.g., Protyniak Will, 427 Pa. 524, 529, 235 A. 2d 372, 375-76 (1967) ; Hunter Will, 416 Pa. 127, 134-35, 205 A. 2d 97, 102 (1964).\nAppellant visited his father on the evening of December 31, 1968, but when asked whether he considered his father capable of executing a will at that time, he stated: \u201cThere\u2019s no way that I could evaluate capability. He was asleep when I came in. He was arousable.\u201d\nWe have never held it to be a sine qua non of a valid will that testator read the will.
