{"id": "1745084", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nIn 1927, testator Isaac Frank created an irrevocable trust by which he received income for life. At his death, his three children, William K. Frank, Robert J. Frank and Bessie Frank Anathan, were to receive income from the trust for their respective lives. The trust provided that, upon the death of each child, \u201cthe share of the income from the trust fund of the one so dying shall be paid to his surviving wife or her surviving husband\u201d for life or until remarriage. If a child died without a surviving spouse, or upon death or remarriage of the surviving spouse, the trust for that child continued for the benefit of his or her issue, who were to receive income in equal shares per stirpes until termination of the trust. The trust was to end\n\u201cat the decease of my last surviving child, and when both my daughters-in-law and my son-in-law shall have died or remarried then and thereupon the corpus of this trust estate shall be divided into three equal parts or shares\nThe trust provided that upon termination, the trustees would divide the principal into three equal parts to be distributed as each of testator\u2019s children had appointed or, in default of exercise of the power of appointment or if the child died without issue surviving, to the child\u2019s heirs at law under the intestate laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nWhen testator created the trust in 1927, his daughter Bessie Frank Anathan was 41 years old. She had married Simon Anathan more than fourteen years previously and bore him two children. Bessie died in 1976. Testator\u2019s second child, William K. Frank, was 36 years old in 1927 and married to Florence K. Frank since 1914. The couple had three children. Florence K. Frank died in 1940. Five years later, William K. Frank married Mary K. Frank, by whom he had one child. William K. Frank died in 1964. Mary K. Frank is now 67 years old. Testator\u2019s third child, Robert J. Frank, was 30 years old in 1927 and married to Cecilia K. Frank for five years. He and Cecilia had two children. Robert J. and Cecilia Frank were divorced in 1951. That same year, Robert J. married Ruth Louise Frank, who remained his wife until her death in 1963. The couple had a son. Robert J. Frank died in 1964.\nRobert J. Frank appointed his share of the trust to his children, Alan, Joan and Barbara. William K. Frank declined to exercise his power of appointment if the trust terminated before his wife Mary\u2019s death or remarriage but, if the trust ended at her death or remarriage, appointed to his surviving issue. Bessie Frank Anathan appointed her share to her issue living at the time of distribution.\nUpon the death of Bessie Frank Anathan in 1976, the trustees petitioned the orphans\u2019 court for distribution. Appellants, Barbara Frank Dane, Joan Frank Apt and Alan Frank, children of Robert J. Frank, argued to the auditing judge that the trust was intended to terminate upon Bessie\u2019s death because she was testator\u2019s last surviving child. Their position was that under the provision terminating the trust \u201cat the decease of my last surviving child, and when both my daughters-in-law and my son-in-law shall have died or remarried . . ., only individuals married to testator\u2019s children at the time of execution of the trust could be a daughter- or son-in-law. Because all those individuals had died by 1971, appellants asserted that the trust ended in 1976 when Bessie died. Appellees Mary K. Frank and her daughter Maude, argued that Mary was a daughter-in-law of testator and that consequently the trust could not terminate until she either died or remarried. The auditing judge determined that Mary K. Frank was a daughter-in-law and that therefore the trust had not terminated. The orphans\u2019 court en banc, equally divided, affirmed the determination of the auditing judge. The only question on this appeal is whether Mary K. Frank is a \u201cdaughter-in-law\u201d within the terms of the termination clause of the trust. We hold that she is a \u201cdaughter-in-iaw\u201d and affirm.\nIn McDowell National Bank v. Applegate, 479 Pa. 300, 304-305, 388 A.2d 666, 668 (1978), this Court again announced:\n\u201cAs in any matter involving interpretation of a [trust], the intent of the testator, if it can be ascertained, must prevail. Estate of Sykes, 477 Pa. 254, 383 A.2d 920 (1978); Blough Estate, 474 Pa. 177, 378 A.2d 276 (1977); Hamilton Estate, 454 Pa. 495, 312 A.2d 373 (1973). To determine this intent, \u2018a court examines the words of the instrument and, if necessary, the scheme of distribution, the circumstances surrounding execution of the will and other facts bearing on the question.\u2019 Estate of Sykes, 477 Pa. at 257, 383 A.2d at 921; accord, Hamilton Estate, supra; Chambers Estate, 438 Pa. 22, 263 A.2d 746 (1970). This intent \u2018must appear with reasonable certainty, such that there can be little doubt of his intent.\u2019 Estate of Sykes, supra. Only when the intent does not appear with reasonable certainty will a court resort to rules of construction. Id.\u201d\nAccord, Flinn Estate, 479 Pa. 312, 388 A.2d 672 (1978); Schappell Estate, 424 Pa. 390, 227 A.2d 651 (1967); Houston Estate, 414 Pa. 579, 201 A.2d 592 (1964).\nNeither the language of the instrument nor the scheme of distribution demonstrates testator\u2019s intent with reasonable certainty. Appellants argue that in the provision terminating the trust, the words \u201cboth\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d in the phrase \u201cboth my daughters-in-law and my son-in-law\u201d indicate that testator had in mind only those personally known to him. This conclusion is unjustified. Most likely, \u201cboth\u201d and \u201cmy\u201d seemed to testator a convenient way to refer to the wives of his two sons, whoever they would be when testator\u2019s children died.\nTestator directed that upon the death of each child, his or her share of income would pass to \u201chis surviving wife or her surviving husband,\u201d but did not use the possessives \u201chis\u201d or \u201cher\u201d and \u201csurviving\u201d in the termination clause. From this variation in wording, appellants conclude that only in the former provision did testator intend to include possible future in-laws. We agree with the auditing judge that no such intent can be derived from the difference in & wording.\nSurrounding circumstances also fail to reveal testator\u2019s intent with reasonable certainty. Appellants argue that testator intended to exclude a future daughter-in-law \u201cin view of the ages and long standing family circumstances of his children and generally accepted social standards of that time,\u201d and \u201cprobably did not envision a divorce by any of his children or the remarriage of a child after divorce or the death of his own spouse.\u201d Appellants have offered no evidence to support their assertions regarding \u201cgenerally accepted social standards of that time,\u201d and we refuse to take judicial notice of a fact far from established as incontestable or a matter of common knowledge. Commonwealth ex rel. Duff v. Keenan, 347 Pa. 574, 33 A.2d 244 (1943). Moreover, the circumstances of testator\u2019s life and family contradict appellant\u2019s conclusion. In 1927, all of testator\u2019s children were under 42 years of age and had been married no longer than 14 years. Robert J. Frank had been married just five years. Thus, appellants err in describing the family circumstances as so long standing and established that testator could not \u201cenvision\u201d changes within his childrens\u2019 families, including death, divorce and remarriage.\nAppellants further argue that testator\u2019s scheme of distribution was to vest remainder interests in his grandchildren at the earliest possible time, which would be thwarted by the view that Mary K. Frank was a daughter-in-law for purposes of the termination clause. On the contrary, the scheme of distribution does not appear designed to vest remainder interests of grandchildren to the exclusion of other interests created in the instrument. The trust creates interests for both testator\u2019s children and their spouses and for grandchildren, but does not indicate that one is to have preference over the other. Appellants\u2019 argument simply substitutes as a conclusion their desire to take remainder interests as of 1976 rather than at a later time.\nWe cannot conclude that testator\u2019s intent appears with reasonable certainty. We therefore resort to a canon of construction to supply testator\u2019s likely intent.\nWe recently reaffirmed that \u201cwhere a testator employs a class designation, his intent is to include not only those known to him but all that may come into the class described unless there is some contrary intent manifested.\u201d McDowell National Bank v. Applegate, 479 Pa. at 306, 388 A.2d at 669 (quotation marks omitted) (bequest to \u201cchildren\u201d included children adopted after execution of instrument); accord, Earle Estate, 369 Pa. 52, 85 A.2d 90 (1951) (bequest to male children of testator\u2019s sons bearing family named included grandsons born after testator\u2019s death); Wanamaker\u2019s Estate, 335 Pa. 241, 6 A.2d 852 (1939) (bequest to \u201cgrandchildren\u201d included those born after testator\u2019s death). Testator did not refer by name to particular daughters-in-law in the termination clause; nor did he otherwise describe them so they could be identified as though specifically named. Rather, he used a class designation. Because no intent to the contrary exists in the trust, we construe the termination clause to include Mary K. Frank, who, after execution of the trust, became a daughter-in-law of testator and stood in that relation to him.\nAppellants argue that this canon of construction produces a violation of the common law Rule Against Perpetuities, which voids interests where a possibility exists that they will not vest until more than twenty-one years after lives in being at the creation of the interest. McDowell National Bank v. Applegate, supra (citing cases). Thus, appellants argue that the possibility existed that, if any of testator\u2019s children remarried, the second spouse would have been born after creation of the trust in 1927, and that, if the trust continued during the life of the second spouse, the gift in default of appointment to the heirs of Bessie Frank Anathan, to be determined at termination of the trust, would occur later than twenty-one years after lives in being. Appellants therefore contend that, to save the trust from a violation of the Rule Against Perpetuities, we must interpret the termination clause to exclude in-laws not married to testator\u2019s children at the time of creation of the trust. See Farrington Will, 422 Pa. 164, 220 A.2d 790 (1966) (instrument should be construed, if possible, to give it legal effect).\nOur interpretation, however, does not cause the trust to run afoul of the Rule. Although we have never applied the Rule to gifts in default of appointment, the better view is that the common law contains an actual events test for such gifts. That is, compliance with the Rule is determined according to actual events rather than by possibilities. Restatement 2d of Property, \u00a7 1.4 (comment i) (Tentative Draft, 1978); 6 American Law of Property \u00a7\u00a7 24.35, 24.36 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952); cf. Warren\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 112, 182 A. 396 (1936) (gift by appointment). Thus, testator\u2019s trust is subject to the actual events test, not the possibilities test.\nUnder the actual events test, Mary K. Frank was a life in being when testator created the trust. No interest can vest later than twenty-one years past her life because the last interests to vest do so upon either her death or remarriage. Thus, construction of the trust\u2019s termination clause to include Mary K. Frank as a \u201cdaughter-in-law\u201d presents no violation of the Rule Against Perpetuities. See Pearson Estate, supra.\nAppellants argue in the alternative that, because testator provided for three independent per stirpital lines of distribution, and all income and principal interests have vested in two of the per stirpital lines, the trust as to those lines should be terminated. This conclusion would allow appellants to receive their interests in the principal even though the trust would continue for the benefit of Mary K. Frank and the children of William K. Frank. Partial termination of a trust, however, is permitted only where the testator has not expressed an intent that the trust remain intact. Card\u2019s Estate, 337 Pa. 69, 9 A.2d 552 (1939). Here, testator clearly specified that the trust would end only at the decease or remarriage of all his daughters- and son-in-law. When testator has designated the time at which the trust will terminate, this Court must respect that instruction.\nDecree affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nAPPENDIX\nPOMEROY, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nEAGEN, C. J., joins in the Opinion of the Court and files a concurring opinion.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nLARSEN, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which MANDERINO, J., joins.\n. See Appendix, infra.\n. Thomas Frank, James Frank and Margaret Frank Green, children of William K. Frank by his first wife, Florence, took part in the orphans\u2019 court proceedings but have not appealed from the court\u2019s decree.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(3), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(3) (Supp.1978).\n. The Decedents, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6104(b) (1975), provides:\n\u201cVoid interest; exceptions. \u2014 Upon the expiration of the period allowed by the common law rule against perpetuities as measured by actual rather than possible events, . . . .\u201d\nFormerly, this section did not apply to instruments, such as testator\u2019s executed in 1927, taking effect before January 1, 1948, the effective date of the predecessor of \u00a7 6104(b), the Estates Act of April 24, 1947, P.L. 100, \u00a7 20, 20 P.S. \u00a7 301.20. Pearson Estate, 442 Pa. 172, 275 A.2d 336 (1971). The Legislature has recently amended the Code to apply the actual events test to \u201call interests heretofore or hereafter created.\u201d 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6104(d) (as amended, effective June 27, 1978). Cf. Arrott Estate, 421 Pa. 275, 217 \u00c1.2d 741 (1966) (Principal and Income Act applicable to trusts created before effective date of the Act); Tyler Trusts, 447 Pa. 40, 289 A.2d 441 (1972) (same). This amendment is particularly salutary because it lays to rest a doctrine which often worked to defeat the intentions of the donor. Newlin\u2019s Estate, 367 Pa. 527, 80 A.2d 819 (1951); accord, 6 American Law of Property \u00a7 24.36 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952). The Legislature\u2019s amendment fortifies our conclusion that the better view of the common law Rule Against Perpetuities examines actual events for gifts in default of appointment."}
