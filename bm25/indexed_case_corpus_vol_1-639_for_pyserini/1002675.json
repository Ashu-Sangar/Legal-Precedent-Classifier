{"id": "1002675", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe assignments of error are in such manifest violation of the rules of court that they ought strictly to be disregarded. Counsel should understand by this time that rules of court are made for the certainty and facilitation of business, and compliance with them is the first requisite to entitle parties to a hearing even in a case of homicide.\nBut even if properly assigned the complaints of error here are totally devoid of merit. The first, that the judge refused \u201c to give the jury instructions for manslaughter,\u201d is not correct in fact unless it is meant that he should have directed a verdict of manslaughter which would, have been manifest error.\nThat the shot which killed the deceased was aimed at another person does not in any way vary the nature and degree of the crime.\nJudgment is affirmed and record remitted to the court below for execution."}
