L. 2762, 20 PS 844, provides that the United States estate tax shall be equitably prorated \u201cexcept in a case where a testator otherwise directs in his will.\u201d The single question is whether testatrix has so otherwise directed.\nCorinne M. Wahr, the testatrix, by her will bequeathed a piano to a named legatee and $50,000 to a friend: The residue she directed: \u201c. . . shall be divided into twelve- equal.. shares or parts, and such twelve shares, or parts. T give and bequeath as follows. . . .\u201d .Testatrix\\:then- gives three of such shares to a named beneficiary\"; three more to eighteen named individuals; tioo more to three named institutions of learning and the remaining four to a church, four hospitals and an institution for the blind.\nThe estate was subject to the United States estate tax amounting to $483,132.58 (with possible additional amounts yet due), which was paid out of the estate by the executor. The Pennsylvania Transfer Inheritance tax, payable by the beneficiaries, was also paid.\nIn computing the value of the \u201cnet estate\u201d taxable under the United States estate tax statute, it is provided that for the purpose of the tax \u201cthe value of the net estate shall be determined ... by deducting from the value of the gross estate ... (d) The amount of all bequests, legacies, devises, or transfers . . . for the use of any corporation organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes. . . .\u201d: Internal Revenue Code, Act of Feb. 10,1939, c. 2, 53 Stat. 123, as amended, 26 U.S.C.A. sec. 812.\nThe Pennsylvania Proration Act of July 2,1937, supra, provides: \u201cWhenever it appears . . . that an executor, administrator, . . . trustee, or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity, has paid an estate tax, levied or assessed . . . under the provisions of any estate tax law of the United States heretofore or hereafter enacted upon or with respect to any property required to be included in the gross estate of a decedent under the provisions of any such law, the amount of the tax so paid, except in a case where a testator otherwise directs in his will, shall be equitably prorated among the persons interested in the estate to whom such property is or may be transferred, or to whom any benefit accrues. Such proration shall be made by the orphans\u2019 court in the proportion as near as may be that the value of the property, interest or benefit of each such person bears to the total value of the property, interests and benefits received by all such persons interested in the estate. . . . For the purposes of this section, the term \u2018persons interested in the estate\u2019 shall . . . include all persons who may be entitled to receive or who have received any property or interest which is required to be included in the gross estate of a decedent, or any benefit whatsoever with respect to any such property or interest, whether under a will or intestacy, or by reason of any transfer, trust, estate, interest, right,. power, or relinquishment of power, taxable under any of the aforementioned laws, providing for the levy or assessment of estate taxes.\u201d (Italics supplied)\nThe Proration Act of 1937 has been declared constitutional by this Court: Harvey Estate, 350 Pa. 53, 38 A. 2d 262; Stadtfeld Estate, 359 Pa. 147, 58 A. 2d 478. Judge Klein (now President Judge) of the Philadelphia Orphans\u2019 Court, in Harvey Estate, supra, in a scholarly opinion, gave the legislative history of the doctrine of equitable proration, which is reported in 47 D. & C. 12. The purpose of the act was to achieve equality of tax contribution and to relieve distributees from inequalities which may result from imposition of the federal estate tax: Jeffery\u2019s Estate, 333 Pa. 15, 3 A. 2d 393; Mellon Estate, 347 Pa. 520, 32 A. 2d 749; Harvey Estate, supra; Stadtfeld Estate, supra.\nThe statutory mandate is that the tax shall be equitably prorated. The ruling of the court below was founded on the equitable ground that gifts which did not contribute to the tax should not share the proration liability. With this we agree. We so decided in Harvey Estate, 350 Pa. 53, 38 A. 2d 262, p. 58, where it is said: \u201c. . . in our opinion the application of the equitable doctrine of contribution demands that the tax be borne commensurately by those whose gifts contribute' to the tax burden and conversely that there be eliminated from such burden all whose legacies do not in any way create or add to the tax.\u201d\nAppellants maintain with vigor that testatrix \u201cotherwise directs in her will,\u201d when she provides that her residuary estate be divided into equal shares and thus precludes tax proration under the act. An equal division of assets, however, does not necessarily mean an equal taso burden. For example: if a testator directed that his estate be divided into two equal shares, one of which he bequeathed to a child and the other to a collateral relative, could it be logically contended that the word \u201cequal\u201d also related to transfer inheritance tax? We think not. As none of the gifts to the charities contributed to the federal tax burden, it is just and equitable that such charitable gifts should be relieved from the payment of any part of such tax. Testatrix\u2019s use of the word \u201cequal\u201d does not indicate contrary intent.\nWe agree with the learned court below that parol evidence is inadmissible to explain, construe or contradict the terms of a will, for which principle no citation of authority is necessary.\nDecree affirmed at cost of appellants."}
