{"id": "878548", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe single question in this case is, whether the learned president of the common pleas erred in holding that the order, allowing the defendants to appeal from the award of arbitrators without payment of costs, did not also relieve them from entering into the required recognizance, and in making, pursuant theretoj the peremptory order recited in the specifications of error? We are clearly of opinion that he did not.\nAccording to section 27 of the act June 16, 1836, P. L. 301, prescribing the \u201crules, regulations and restrictions \u201d under which either party may appeal from an award of arbitrators, the necessary prerequisites are: (1) making the specified oath or affirmation ; (2) payment of \u201c all costs that may have accrued,\u201d and (3) entering into the required recognizance. As to the second prerequisite, section 28 of the act provides for obtaining \u201c an order that the .... appeal shall be good,\u201d without payment of costs, in certain cases wherein the judge making the order is satisfied that the party applying therefor is, \u201c by reason of poverty, unable to pay the costs; \u201d but, there is no provision in the act, or elsewhere, authorizing the court or a judge thereof to make an order, in forma pauperis, relieving appellants of the class to which defendants belong from complying with the third necessary prerequisite above mentioned.\nIt would, no doubt, have been competent for the legislature to have relieved that class from compliance with the third prerequisite as well as the second, but it does not appear to have been their intention to do so.1 While the policy of the act is to prevent frivolous appeals, the exception as to payment of costs, above referred to, was made for a reason apparent in the exception itself. In the 31st section, a further exception is made in favor of executors, administrators, minors, etc. As to that class, it is declared, \u201c the appeal shall be good without payment of costs, or entering into recognizance, if such appellant shall not have taken out the rule of reference.\u201d In Morton\u2019s Admrs. v. Morton, 11 Pa. 398, it was held that this exception did not relieve the administrators from complying with the first prerequisite of the 27th section of the act. As was said in that case, \u201c the old maxim is, the exception proves the rule, that is, makes the general rule good, so far as the exception does not reach.\u201d\nIt follows from what has been said that the decree should be sustained.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellants.\nPee Cueiam:\nAnd now, April 15, \u201996, the decree filed in this case on the 6th April, \u201996, is amended by adding the following words, viz: \u201c With leave to the appellant to perfect the appeal taken by him from the award of arbitrators by giving the recognizance required by law within twenty days from the date of this decree,\u201d viz, the 6th day of April, 1896."}
