{"id": "1714943", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThese six appeals arise from appellants\u2019 convictions in the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County, for violations of the Uniform Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, all of which occurred during the months of April to June, 1972, Appellants raise no objections to their convictions. However, they contend that their sentences were imposed in accordance with a policy agreed to in advance by the three judges of the court and the district attorney\u2019s office without reference to either appellants\u2019 individual characteristics or to the circumstances of the particular offenses. An equally divided Superior Court affirmed the sentences in a per curiam order. Judge Spaeth, in his opinion in support of reversal joined by Hoffman and Cercone, JJ., stated:\n\u201c[T]he record demonstrates: That the three judges had agreed in advance that the sentence to be imposed for a sale of heroin should be three to ten years imprisonment plus a fine, without consideration being given to the defendant\u2019s individual characteristics, the sentence to be consecutive if more than one sale were proved; and that each of the six appellants was sentenced in accordance with this agreement. From these facts it follows that the sentences were illegal.\u201d\nWe agree and vacate the sentences imposed and remand for resentencing.\nI.\nAppellants were all charged with the illegal sale of controlled substances. There was no evidence of a conspiracy among the appellants, and no claim is made that the sentences imposed were based on such an allegation.\nAppellant Harry Martin appeared before the Honorable Wilson Bucher on September 21, 1972, and pleaded guilty to three sales of heroin. The undercover agents involved gave a brief recitation of the circumstances of the sales, and an inquiry was made into the voluntariness of the guilty plea and of the waiver of trial by jury. Thereafter, defense counsel and appellant\u2019s mother were allowed to present evidence concerning appellant\u2019s background. At 10:00 a. m. the court recessed until 2:00 p. m. When court reconvened, Judge Bucher imposed a sentence of three to ten years imprisonment to be served consecutively, and a fine of $2,500 for each of the three sales, i. e., nine to thirty years and $7,500.\nAppellant Rafael Nieves was tided before the Honorable W. G. Johnstone, Jr., with a jury on September 25, 1972, and was found guilty of five counts of selling heroin. Appellant\u2019s attorney, at the outset of the trial, moved for a pretrial psychiatric examination because there was evidence that appellant was insane. He also moved for a change of venue asserting that the court had adopted an illegal sentencing policy. Both motions were denied without comment. At the sentencing hearing, only passing reference was made to appellant\u2019s background and mental capacity, and the question whether appellant was an addict, raised by defense counsel, was ignored. A sentence of three to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, to be served consecutively, and a fine of $100 for each count, was then imposed, i. e., fifteen to fifty years and $500.\nAppellant Warren Ca\u00f1\u00f3les was tried before Judge Bucher, sitting with a jury; he was found guilty on September 28, 1972, of three counts of selling heroin. The jury added the words \u201cwith recommendation for treatment\u201d to its verdict form. At the sentencing hearing, testimony was presented to the effect that appellant was addicted to heroin, that he had no prior offenses other than a minor drinking violation, and that he did not sell heroin for profit. These contentions were neither denied nor contradicted, and the court, before imposing sentence, made no further inquiry into any of these matters. During the hearing, the court made the following comments :\n\u201cHe [appellant] was found guilty here of sales and we treated the others the same way.\nI shouldn\u2019t have to torture myself. The court has already determined it\u2019s three to ten years is that it\u2019s going to do. Why should I do any different in this case?\nThe legislature says it\u2019s serious and they expect the courts to impose sentences to deter. I haven\u2019t heard any reason why we shouldn\u2019t give the standard sentence we have been giving this term of court.\nThe rehabilitation is a legislative and executive matter. I have nothing to do with rehabilitation.\nI don\u2019t think these sentences mean what they say, either.\nI am going to sentence just as we have sentenced in the past.\u201d\nThese comments were made in response to attempts by defense counsel and an undercover agent to show that appellant Ca\u00f1\u00f3les sold only to users; that he was heavily addicted; that he was not a threat to the community; and that he was in need of treatment. These mitigating and extenuating circumstances were deemed irrelevant. The judge sentenced appellant \u201cjust as we have sentenced in the past\u201d: three to ten years imprisonment, to be served consecutively, and a fine of $100 for each count, i. e., nine to thirty years and $300.\nAppellants Hector Burgos and James Keyes appeared separately before the Honorable W. Hensel Brown on September 29, 1972. Appellant Burgos pleaded guilty to two counts of selling heroin, and appellant Keyes pleaded guilty to three counts of selling heroin, two counts of selling cocaine and one count of selling marijuana.\nThe court made virtually no inquiry into either the circumstances of the crimes or appellants\u2019 backgrounds at either sentencing hearing. Appellant Burgos received a sentence of three to ten years imprisonment, to be served consecutively, and a fine of $1,500 for each count, i. e., $8,000 and six to twenty years. The sentence imposed on appellant Keyes was one to two years imprisonment, and a fine of $500 for the sale of marijuana; the same sentence for the two sales of cocaine; and three to ten years imprisonment, and a fine of $2,500 for each of the three sales of heroin, the prison terms to be served consecutively, i. e., eleven to thirty-four years and $8,500.\nAppellant Dale Troop was the last of the six appellants to be sentenced. He was found guilty of a single sale of heroin in a trial before Judge Brown, sitting with a jury. The sentencing hearing began immediately following the jury\u2019s verdict and consisted of statements filling a total of two and a half typewritten pages. The court made virtually no inquiry into the circumstances of the crime or appellant\u2019s background, and imposed a sentence of three to ten years imprisonment and a fine of $2,500 for the single count.\nThe record amply demonstrates that the three judges had agreed in advance that the sentence to be imposed for a sale of heroin was to be three to ten years imprisonment plus a fine, and all of the sentences were to run consecutively. In no case was a pre-sentence report ordered. No meaningful inquiry was made into the appellants\u2019 backgrounds, individual characteristics, relative culpability or prospects for rehabilitation, despite clear evidence that the appellants\u2019 offenses were committed in varying circumstances. In short, all appellants\u2019 sentences were based on an abstract predetermination of the sentence to be imposed for the particular offense, without regard to the individual circumstances of particular cases.\nII.\nMr. Justice Schaefer of the Supreme Court of Illinois has stated:\n\u201cThe quality of a nation\u2019s civilization can be largely measured by the methods it uses in the enforcement of its criminal laws.\u201d\nSentencing procedures, which have undergone substantial revision during the last one hundred years, have become a reflection of the effectiveness of that enforcement. At one time, sentencing by a court after a finding of guilt was purely ceremonial, since there was but one penalty at law for any given crime. However, during the nineteenth century, when incarceration became the primary mode of punishment, the practice of discretionary sentencing began. At first this took the form of executive pardons, and the judge\u2019s duty remained only to apply the sentence mandated by law. However, discretionary sentencing soon became an integral part of judicial procedure; the sentencing court had increasing discretion in its choice of sentence. This development re-fleeted the move toward individualized sentencing, which attempted to rehabilitate, as well as to punish, the offender.\nThe indeterminate sentence won early recognition in Pennsylvania. The Act of June 19, 1911, P.L. 1055 \u00a7 6, as amended, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1057 (1964), provides in pertinent part:\n\u201cWhenever any person, convicted in any court of this Commonwealth of any crime punishable by imprisonment in a State penitentiary, shall be sentenced to imprisonment therefor in any penitentiary or other institution of this State, or in any county or municipal institution, the court, instead of pronouncing upon such convict a definite or fixed term of imprisonment, shall pronounce upon such a convict a sentence of imprisonment for an indefinite term: Stating in such sentence the minimum and maximum limits thereof; and the maximum limit shall never exceed the maximum time now or hereafter prescribed as a penalty for such offense ; and the minimum shall never exceed one-half of the maximum sentence prescribed by any court.\u201d\nThe Legislature reinforced these provisions by allowing suspension of sentence and probation, at the sentencing court\u2019s discretion, in all but the most serious crimes. Act of June 9, 1911, P.L. 1055, \u00a7 1, as amended, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1051 (1964). The court has the power to use this sentencing alternative where:\n\u201c. . . the said court believes that the character of the defendant and the circumstances of the case [are] such that he or she is not likely again to engage in an offensive course of conduct, and that the public good does not demand or require that the defendant should suffer the penalty imposed by law . . ..\u201d\nId. Moreover, if more than one sentence is being imposed on the defendant at one time, the sentencing court has the power to have them run concurrently or consecutively. The Legislature gave the trial court the power to order a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric and diagnostic examination of the defendant in order to properly determine the appropriate disposition.\nPennsylvania\u2019s procedure of indeterminate sentencing carries with it an implicit adoption of the philosophy of individual sentencing. This necessitates the granting of broad discretion to the trial judge, who must determine, among the sentencing alternatives and the range of permissible penalties, the proper sentence to be imposed. The importance of this discretion cannot be overemphasized ; many commentators argue that it is one of the most important, and most easily abused, powers vested in the trial court today. In United States v. Waters, 141 U.S.App.D.C. 289, 437 F.2d 722, 723 (1970), Judge Wilkey, speaking for the court, states:\n\u201cWhat happens to an offender after conviction is the least understood, the most fraught with irrational discrepancies, and the most in need of improvement of any phase in our criminal justice system.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth argues that this sentencing discretion should not be disturbed unless the trial court exceeds the statutorily prescribed limits or is so manifestly excessive as to constitute too severe a punishment. See Commonwealth v. Williams, 456 Pa. 550, 551-52, 317 A. 2d 250, 251 (1974); Commonwealth v. Lee, 450 Pa. 152, 156, 299 A.2d 640, 642 (1973); Commonwealth v. Person, 450 Pa, 1, 4-5, 297 A.2d 460, 462 (1972); Commonwealth v. Wrona, 442 Pa. 201, 206, 275 A.2d 78, 81 (1971).\nIt is true that the sentence imposed is normally left undisturbed on appeal because the trial court is in a far better position to weigh the factors involved in such a determination. However, we have held that the court\u2019s discretion must be exercised within certain procedural limits, including the consideration of sufficient and accurate information. In Commonwealth v. Green, 396 Pa. 137, 151 A.2d 241 (1951), a first degree murder case, we held that the trial court abused its discretion when it imposed the death penalty solely on the basis of the criminal act. There was no consideration of the character of the convicted individual and no inquiry was made into any extenuating or mitigating circumstances. See also Commonwealth v. Irelan, 341 Pa. 43, 17 A.2d 897 (1941); Commonwealth v. Garramone, 307 Pa. 507, 161 A. 733 (1932). In Commonwealth v. Phelps, 450 Pa. 597, 301 A.2d 678 (1973), we held that, if the court orders a presentence report, defense counsel has a right to examine its contents before sentencing and, if he contests any portion, to offer evidence in rebuttal. We note further that such review is in conformity with the ABA Project on Minimum Standards of Justice, Standards Relating to Appellate Review of Sentencing, \u00a7 3.2 (Approved Draft, 1968):\n\u201cThe authority of the reviewing court with respect to the sentence should specifically extend to review of:\n(ii) the manner in which the sentence was imposed, including the sufficiency and accuracy of the information on which it was based.\u201d\nThe procedures employed by the sentencing court in the appeals before us today ignore the basic premises of Pennsylvania individualized sentencing. Here, as in Green, the nature of the criminal act was used as the sole basis for the determination of the length of sentence, and all sentences of imprisonment were to run consecutively. Thus the court failed to exercise its broad discretion in accordance with the applicable statutory requirements.\nThe sentence must be imposed for the minimum amount of confinement that is consistent with the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense, and the rehabilitative needs of the defendant. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1321(b) (Supp.1975). At least two factors are crucial to such determination \u2014 the particular circumstances of the offense and the character of the defendant. Pa. R.Crim.P. 1403(a)(2) provides that all pre-sentence reports shall include such information. We hold that regardless of whether a pre-sentence report is ordered, the sentencing court must at least consider these two factors in its sentencing determination. Failure to give such individualized consideration requires that these sentences be vacated.\nObviously, the extent and the contents of a pre-sentence inquiry will vary depending on the particular case. A more extensive and careful investigation is clearly called for in felony convictions, particularly where long terms of confinement are contemplated. The ABA Project on Minimum Standards of Justice has stated the essential and adequate elements of a full pre-sentence report. We note that most of these factors are clearly relevant in any sentencing disposition, although the weight given by the sentencing court to any one factor must depend on the particular case.\nIn these cases the court did not order any pre-sentence reports although it was authorized to do so. See Pa. R.Crim.P. 1403. Normally such reports should be used, although they are sometimes unnecessary because other sources of information are available. However, pre-sentence reports are of obvious importance to the sentencing court. In Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 249-50, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1084, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1965), the United States Supreme Court stated:\n\u201c[Pre-sentence] reports have been given a high value by conscientious judges who want to sentence persons in the best available information rather than on guesswork and inadequate information. To deprive sentencing judges of this kind of information would undermine modern penological procedural policies\nThe ABA Project on Minimum Standards of Justice, Standards Relating to Probation \u00a7 2.1 (Approved Draft, 1970), recommends that a pre-sentence report is peculiarly necessary in any of the following circumstances: 1) where incarceration for one year or more is a possible disposition; 2) where the defendant is less than twenty-one years old; and 3) where the defendant is a first offender. These situations require the utmost care in sentence determination. We are therefore requesting that the Criminal Procedural Rules Committee prepare a recommendation for the Court amending Rule 1403 to require that, whenever a sentencing court fails to order a pre-sentence report in any of these situations, it shall place in the record its reasons for dispensing with such report.\nOrder of the Superior Court affirming judgments of sentence reversed. Judgments of sentence vacated and cases remanded for resentencing.\nEAGEN, J., concurs in the result.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which JONES, C. J., joins.\n. Act of April 14, 1972, P.L. 233, \u00a7 1 et seq., 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-101 et seq. (Supp.1975). These convictions arise under id. \u00a7 13(a)(30), 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30).\n. Commonwealth v. Martin, 226 Pa.Super. 181, 313 A.2d 264 (1973). We allowed this appeal under the authority of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp.1975).\n. Commonwealth v. Martin, 226 Pa.Superior Ct. 181, 190, 313 A. 2d 264, 269 (1973) (Spaeth, J., Opinion in Support of Reversal, joined by Hoffman and Cercone, JJ.).\n. Appellant had no prior record; had gone to the first semester of college but had dropped out for financial reasons; had held numerous employment positions; had served in the Armed Forces in Vietnam and received an honorable discharge; and had grown up ih a broken home. Appellant had used heroin before, but it was unclear whether he was addicted to the drug.\n. Appellants assert that during this recess the three judges and the district attorney\u2019s office conferred to determine the sentencing of all six appellants. Brief for appellants at 3. Appellee made no response to this contention, but there is nothing in the record to support it.\n. The court stated that it was applying the Drug, Device, and Cosmetic Act, Act of September 26, 1961, P.L. 1664, as amended, formerly codified as 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-20(d). The permissible range of sentence for the sale of heroin under that act was a fine not to exceed $5,000 and imprisonment of not less than five nor more than twenty years. In fact, the proper statutory provision, to the extent it does not set a greater penalty, was Act of April 14, 1972, P.L. 233, \u00a7 13(f)(1), 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(f)(l) (Supp.1975). See Commonwealth v. Santiago, 462 Pa. 216, 340 A.2d 440 (1975). The latter provision sets as a maximum sentence of $250,000 fine and fifteen years of imprisonment. We need not decide here whether this mistake alone would amount to an abuse of discretion by the sentencing court. However, it is obvious that the proper exercise of discretion requires that the court have an accurate understanding of the range of penalties allowed for by the Legislature.\n. The following exchange occurred during the abbreviated sentencing hearing:\n\u201cMR. SHAY [defense attorney]: This man was a user for five years. There seems to be a distinction between a pure user and a seller. But the user who sells to support his own habit\u2014\nTHE COURT: You have no concern about the victims.\nMR. SHAY: Yes, sir. I think he should not receive an over-burdensome sentence.\nTHE COURT: Okay, I will not give him an overburdensome sentence.\u201d\nNo further inquiry into appellant\u2019s addiction occurred.\n. The following colloquy constitutes appellant Burgos\u2019 entire sentencing hearing:\n\u201cTHE COURT: Mr. Burgos, do you understand the English Language?\nMR. ROMEREZ (interpreter): No, he does not, sir.\nTHE COURT: Has he been advised of the consequences of entering a guilty plea to the offense of selling a narcotic, heroin?\nMR. HAYNES [defense attorney]: Yes, he has, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: How much education has he had?\nMR. HAYNES: Eighth grade, sir.\nTHE COURT: In Puerto Rico?\nMR. HAYNES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Is he entering this plea of his own free will and without fear, threats or promises?\nMR. HAYNES: Yes, sir.\nTHE COURT: Does he understand that for a first offense of this nature, he could get a $5,000 fine and be sentenced to a minimum of five years to a maximum of twenty years? And, on a second offense, he could get a $15,000 fine and a minimum of ten years and a maximum of thirty years?\nMR. HAYNES: Yes, Your Honor. He is a first offender, sir.\nTHE COURT: Not that the court is going to give that but that is what could be given.\nMR. HAYNES: Yes, sir, he understands that.\nYour Honor, these are members of his family here. He has had a lot of medical problems. He presently has a accute [sic] venereal disease and a stomach disorder. He has spent a lot of time in the hospital. He hasn\u2019t been able to work.\nTHE COURT: How much did he sell here?\nTROOPER ECKENRUDE: On the first day, sir, he sold me four decks for $40.\nTROOPER GILLSON: On the Fifth of June, he sold four foil packets for $40.\u201d [Sentence imposed.]\nBecause there was no trial, this colloquy is the sole basis upon which appellant was sentenced. It offers absolutely no basis for a determination of mitigating circumstances, appellant\u2019s background, or motivation for the sale.\nIn appellant Keyes\u2019 hearing the prosecution maintained that appellant was not a user, but only a seller, of heroin. Appellant\u2019s counsel brought to the court\u2019s attention appellant\u2019s ill health, family and work status, all of which the court chose to ignore.\n. Apparently only one sentence was imposed for the two sales.\n. The following colloquy constitutes the entire sentencing record:\n[Motion for new trial denied.]\n\u201cTHE COURT: [W]hat has been the sentence imposed in other cases?\nMR. LUCARELLI [district attorney]: Three to ten years. That was the Commonwealth\u2019s offer in this case.\nTHE COURT: I don\u2019t p\u00e9nalize anybody for going to trial. This is a first offense?\nMR. STAINTON [defense counsel]: Yes, your Honor, I believe it is.\nMR. LUCARELLI: Your Honor, I might say, it is the Commonwealth\u2019s opinion that this man is not an \u00abaddict and has been selling these drugs for profit only.\nMR. STAINTON: I think Mr. Lucarelli is asking the Defendant be punished for going to trial.\nTHE COURT: Others were pushers too, Mr. Lucarelli, and they entered guilty pleas and even though the jury disbelieved him, and rightfully so, still he had a right \u2014 Constitutional right to go to trial.\nNow, what is the fine that is imposed on these cases?\nMR. LUCARELLI: There has been varying amounts. One person got a seventy-five hundred dollar fine on three counts\u2014\nTHE COURT: All right. Anything you want to say?\nMR. STAINTON: No, Your Honor.\u201d [Sentence imposed.]\n. The Commonwealth argues that different sentences were imposed because of the differences in the amount of the fines. This contention is without merit. It appears that the fines were based solely on whether the particular defendant had any assets. Thus they reflect neither the backgrounds of the appellants nor the circumstances of the crime. Furthermore, the terms of imprisonment are the real and effective sentences, and, in these cases the prison terms are identical.\nMr. Justice Nix, in dissent, asserts that no such plan existed, relying on five cases which were not appealed. These cases do not alter our conclusion. Two unappealed cases, Commonwealth v. Brown and Commonwealth v. Ortego, according to appellee\u2019s appendix to its brief, were sentenced in accordance with the court\u2019s predetermined \u201cstandard sentence.\u201d They therefore fully support appellants\u2019 allegations. The sentencing hearing in Com monwealth v. Cordova occurred a year and a half after all appellants had been sentenced. Commonwealth v. Gonzales is also distinguishable because, according to appellee\u2019s appendix to its brief, the defendant was sentenced on two counts, but only one of these was for the sale of heroin \u2014 the subject of the sentencing plan. Thus, only Commonwealth v. Amaro might challenge this conclusion, and the record does not establish on what basis the \u201cnon-standard\u201d sentence was imposed.\nEven assuming these cases do not confirm the existence of a sentencing plan, they do not alter the fact that these six appellants were sentenced according to such a plan. There is no basis for the dissenting opinion\u2019s conclusion that \u201cthe record conclusively establishes sales of heroin for profit absent any significant mitigating or extenuating circumstances\u201d or for its assertion that the crimes were inspired by \u201cgreed.\u201d First, there was evidence before the sentencing courts that these defendants committed the crimes in strikingly different circumstances. For example, appellant Ca\u00f1\u00f3les, according to the uncontradicted testimony of both the Commonwealth\u2019s undercover agent and appellant\u2019s counsel was heavily addicted and did not sell for profit, yet he received a stiffer sentence than appellant Burgos, who was alleged to be unaddicted and a pusher. These differences were treated as irrelevant and were ignored. (See supra at 653-654.) Second, the sentencing hearings were too cursory to establish that no mitigating or extenuating circumstances existed (see, e. g., supra at 653-654, note 8; supra at 654, note 10). No pre-sentence reports were requested by the sentencing courts to correct this deficiency. The dissenting opinion\u2019s reliance on the colloquy in appellant Martin\u2019s sentencing hearing is misplaced. That colloquy occurred prior to imposition of any of these sentences and prior to the time that, appellants contend, the sentence procedure was determined (see supra at 651-652). As the remaining sentencing colloquies demonstrate, these sentences were imposed without reference to any mitigating or extenuating circumstances. Third, to deny the existence of a \u201cstandard sentence\u201d without regard to individualized circumstances in these six cases ignores the very words used by at least one of the sentencing judges (see supra at 652-653).\nFinally, the dissenting opinion\u2019s characterization of these sentences as \u201cuniform\u201d is inaccurate. The arbitrary decision to make the sentences consecutive, without regard to the circumstances of the individual defendant, resulted in widely differing sentences. Such arbitrary determinations, made prior to the sentencing hearings which are intended to provide information for making the determinations, have no place in an individualized sentencing scheme (see infra at 657, n. 23).\n.

See also Note, supra note 13, at 822.\n.

The Legislature has recently codified this philosophy that has long been implicit in our law:\n. . the court shall follow the general principle that the sentence imposed shall call for the minimum amount of confinement that is consistent with the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense, and the rehabilitative needs of the defendant.\u201d\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1321(b) (Supp.1975).\nThis section is part of the Sentencing Code, enacted on December 30, 1974, effective March 30, 1975. Consequently, it is not, as such, applicable to these sentences, imposed in 1972.\nThe principle articulated in section 1321(b) is substantially the same as the general principle enunciated by the ABA Project on Minimum Standards of Justice. See ABA Project on Minimum Standards of Justice, Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures \u00a7 2.2 (Approved Draft, 1968). The commentary to that section makes clear that it is based on the committee\u2019s strong view that dislocation of the offender from the community should be minimized.\n. There have been numerous attacks on indeterminate sentences on the ground that they are inherently unfair. Many authorities now advocate a return to sentencing for specific terms in at least some situations. See, e. g., Struggle for Justice: A Report on Crime and Punishment in America Prepared For the American Friends Service Committee, 147-48 (1971); Frankel, Lawlessness in Sentencing, 41 U.Cin.L.Rev. 1 (1972). Such a change, however, if deemed desirable, must come from the Legislature.\n. Indeed, many cite it as a primary source of unfairness within the indeterminate sentencing procedure. Professor Kadish states:\n. the new penology has resulted in vesting in judges and parole and probation agencies the greatest degree of uncontrolled power over the liberty of human beings that one can find in the legal system.\u201d\nKadish, supra note 15, at 916.\nProfessor Davis discusses the wide disparity in sentencing practices caused by this uncontrolled discretion. He urges procedural structuring which would change \u201cunguided discretion to guided discretion.\u201d K. Davis, Discretionary Justice 133-141, 135 (1969). See also Palmer, A Model of Criminal Dispositions, 62 Geo.L.J. 1-59 (1973); ABA Commission on Standards of Judicial Administration, Standards Relating to Trial Courts, \u00a7 2.00(c) (Tentative Draft, 1975).\n. We note that the same factors relevant to other determinations of sentencing are applicable to the decision to have terms of imprisonment run consecutively rather than concurrently. See generally ABA Project on Minimum Standards of Justice, Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures, \u00a7 3.4 (Approved Draft, 1968).\n. Contrary to the dissenting opinion\u2019s assertion, we too believe that the seriousness of defendant\u2019s crime may itself necessitate imposing total confinement rather than probation. The applicable statute, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1325 (Supp.1975), states:\n\u201cThe court shall impose a sentence of total confinement if, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and the history, character, and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that the total confinement of the defendant is necessary because:\n(3) a lesser sentence will depreciate the seriousness of the crime of the defendant.\u201d\nHowever, we cannot agree with the dissent\u2019s apparent assertion that the nature of defendant\u2019s crime can dictate not only total confinement but also a fixed term of confinement without regard to individual circumstances.\n. See note 20 supra.\n. \u201c(A) a complete description of the offense and the circumstances surrounding it, not limited to aspects developed for the record as part of the determination of guilt;\n(B) a full description of any prior criminal record of the offender;\n(C) a description of the educational background of the offender;\n(D) a description of the employment background of the offender, including any military record and including his present employment status and capabilities;\n(E) the social history of the offender, including family relationships, marital status, interests and activities, residence history, and religious affiliations;\n(F) the offender\u2019s medical history and, if desirable, a psychological or psychiatric report;\n(G) information about environments to which the offender might return or to which he could be sent should probation be granted;\n(H) supplementary reports from clinics, institutions and other social agencies with which the offender has been involved;\n(I) information about special resources which might be available to assist the offender, such as treatment centers, residential facilities, vocational training services, special educational facilities, rehabilitative programs of various institutions to which the offender might be committed, special programs in the probation department, and other similar programs which are particularly relevant to the offender\u2019s situation;\n(J) a summary of the most significant aspects of the report, including specific recommendations as to the sentence if the sentencing court has so requested.\u201d\nABA Project on Minimum Standards of Justice, Standards Relating to Probation, \u00a7 2.3 (Approved Draft, 1970). See also, Advisory Council of Judges of the National Probation and Parole Association, Guides for Sentencing, 33-47 (1957).\n. Two federal circuits have adopted a similar policy. In United States v. Frazier, 479 F.2d 983 (2d Cir. 1973), the court held that a sentencing court abused its discretion by neither ordering a pre-sentence report nor justifying its action in the record. Accord, United States v. Manuella, 478 F.2d 440 (2d Cir. 1973). In United States v. Dinapoli, 519 F.2d 104 (6th Cir. 1975), the court held that, prior to sentencing a youthful offender to a substantial term of imprisonment, the sentencing court must order a pre-sentence report and conduct a sentencing hearing.\nMany respected commentators would make pre-sentence reports mandatory in situations similar to those proposed here. See, e. g., American Law Institute, Model Penal Code Sentencing Provisions \u00a7 7.07(1) (Proposed Official Draft, 1962); Davis, supra note 21, at 138; National Advisory Commission on Criminal Justice, Standards and Goals, Corrections \u00a7 16.10 (1973)."}
