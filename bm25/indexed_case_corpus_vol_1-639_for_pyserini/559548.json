{"id": "559548", "contents": "OPINION\nNEWMAN, Justice.\nJames Dennis (Appellant) appeals from the Judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (trial court) sentencing him to death on his conviction for first degree murder. We affirm.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nAt approximately 1:50 p.m. on October 22, 1991, seventeen-year-old Chedell Williams (Victim) and her friend Zahra Howard were climbing the steps to enter the Fern Rock SEPTA station at Tenth and Nedro Streets in Philadelphia when they were approached by Appellant and another man. The men blocked the girls\u2019 path and Appellant demanded that the Victim give him her earrings. The girls turned and ran. Appellant followed the Victim and grabbed her in the street. He ripped the earrings from the Victim\u2019s ears, drew a .32 caliber handgun, and shot her in the neck, killing her.\nThree witnesses had protracted and unobstructed views of Appellant during and after the shooting: Zahra Howard observed the shooting from a nearby fruit vendor\u2019s stand; Thomas Bertha, a stone mason who was working on a nearby building, heard the gunshot and saw Appellant flee the scene; and James Cameron, a SEPTA cashier, observed the shooting from approximately eight feet away. Each of the three witnesses positively identified Appellant as the perpetrator from a photo array, at a lineup, and again at trial.\nAt Appellant\u2019s jury trial, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of the three eyewitnesses, as well as evidence that Appellant had a gun of the type used in the murder and clothing resembling that worn by the perpetrator. Appellant argued that the eyewitnesses had misidentified him, and claimed that he was on a bus to the Abbottsford Homes at the time of the murder. The jury returned verdicts of guilty on charges of first degree murder, robbery, criminal conspiracy, violating the Uniform Firearms Act, and possessing an instrument of crime.\nAt the penalty hearing, the Commonwealth sought the death penalty on the basis of two aggravating circumstances: that Appellant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6); and that, in the commission of the offense, Appellant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the Victim, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(7). Defense counsel raised three mitigating factors: that Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(1); Appellant\u2019s age at the time of the crime (twenty-one), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(4); and the general mitigating factor of Appellant\u2019s character and record, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8). The jury found one aggravating circumstance, killing while in the perpetration of a felony, and one mitigating circumstance, no significant history of prior criminal convictions, and that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating circumstance. Accordingly, the trial court sentenced Appellant to death.\nAppellant filed Post-Verdict Motions, which the trial court denied, and then appealed to this Court.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this appeal, Appellant challenges various aspects of both the guilt phase and penalty phase of his trial. We address the issues seriatim.\n1. Alleged Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\nAppellant argues that his trial counsel was ineffective in a number of respects. To prove ineffectiveness of counsel, Appellant must show that: (1) the claim is of arguable merit; (2) counsel had no reasonable basis for the action or inaction; and (3) if not for counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, the outcome of the trial would have been different. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987). We apply this standard to Appellant\u2019s claims, as follows:\na. Failure to investigate witness Latanya Cason\nAt trial, Cason testified that she saw Appellant at the Abbottsford Homes, about four miles from the crime scene, at approximately 4:00 to 4:30 p.m., more than two hours after the 1:50 p.m. shooting. Cason\u2019s recollection of the time was based on her belief that she had left work and gone to cash a welfare check at approximately 2:00 p.m. During their investigation, however, the police came into possession of a Department of Public Welfare (DPW) receipt showing that Cason cashed her check at 1:03 p.m.\nIn light of this evidence, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate Cason, because an investigation would have revealed that she was mistaken about the time she saw Appellant at the Abbottsford Homes. Had trial counsel been effective, Appellant argues, Cason would have supported Appellant\u2019s alibi by testifying that she saw Appellant at approximately 2:30 p.m. Appellant also argues that the Commonwealth withheld the DPW receipt in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to discover the violation.\nAppellant\u2019s claims fail for a number of reasons. First, even if trial counsel had investigated Cason and discovered that she saw Appellant at the Abbottsford Homes at 2:30 p.m., her testimony would not support Appellant\u2019s alibi, because the murder occurred at 1:50 p.m., forty minutes earlier than Cason\u2019s earliest estimate. Moreover, Cason\u2019s testimony would have been cumulative of the testimony of witness Willis Meredith, who testified that he saw Appellant at the Abbottsford Homes at approximately 2:15 to 2:30 p.m. See Commonwealth v. Hall, 549 Pa. 269, 701 A.2d 190 (1997), cert, denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 1534, 140 L.Ed.2d 684 (1998) (counsel not ineffective for failing to present cumulative testimony); Commonwealth v. Robinson, 487 Pa. 541, 410 A.2d 744 (1980) (same). Finally, it is clear that there clearly was no Brady violation. The DPW receipt was not exculpatory, because it had no bearing on Appellant\u2019s alibi, and there is no evidence that the Commonwealth withheld the receipt from the defense. Accordingly, Appellant\u2019s claims of ineffectiveness regarding Cason and the DPW receipt have no arguable merit.\nb. Failure to impeach mtness Charles Thompson\nThompson, who was in a singing group with Appellant, testified that, on the night of the murder, he saw Appellant with a gun that resembled the murder weapon. On direct examination, Thompson admitted that he had an open criminal case for drug possession. Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach Thompson with evidence that his open drug case was for possession with intent to deliver, a felony, not simple possession, a misdemeanor. Appellant also argues that the prosecutor violated Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972), by knowingly offering Thompson\u2019s false testimony, and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to discover the violation.\nAppellant\u2019s claims have no merit. Trial counsel adequately cross-examined Thompson on other matters and offered testimony of other members of the singing group that undermined Thompson\u2019s credibility. Consequently, counsel\u2019s showing that Thompson was charged with possession with intent to deliver instead of simple possession would have been of little or no benefit to Appellant. Even if the proposed impeachment had caused the jury to disbelieve Thompson\u2019s testimony in its entirety, considering the overwhelming evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt, there is no indication that the outcome of the trial would have been different. As for the alleged Giglio violation, Appellant presents no evidence that the prosecutor knew that Thompson\u2019s open case was for possession with intent to deliver instead of simple possession. Consequently, Appellant fails to demonstrate ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to Thompson.\nc. Failure to establish the Victim\u2019s height\nAt trial, the medical examiner testified that the bullet that killed the Victim entered her neck and traveled in a slightly downward path. Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to establish the Victim\u2019s height, five feet ten inches, relative to Appellant\u2019s height, five feet five inches, because such evidence would have cast doubt on Appellant\u2019s ability to shoot the Victim such that the bullet would travel in the manner described by the medical examiner. This argument is patently without merit. According to the eyewitnesses, prior to shooting the Victim, the killer ripped the earrings from her ears, thereby pulling her head and neck down. Ergo, the relative heights of the killer and the Victim were irrelevant.\nd. Failure to call eyewitnesses who did not identify Appellant\nAppellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call eyewitnesses David LeRoy and Anthony Over-street, both of whom observed the shooting but did not testify at trial. LeRoy told the police that he \u201ccaught a glimpse\u201d of the killer\u2019s face, but could not identify him at a photo array. Overstreet identified Appellant from a photo array, but made a misidentification at a lineup. Although these two witnesses could not positively identify Appellant as the killer, Appellant does not show how their testimony would have discredited that of the three eyewitnesses who did positively identify him. Hence, this claim warrants no relief.\ne. Failure to raise a Batson claim\nIn voir dire, the prosecutor exercised twenty peremptory challenges, dismissing thirteen African-American venirepersons, two Hispanic venirepersons, and five Caucasian venirepersons. Appellant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory challenges violated Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise this issue. This argument is meritless. In the first instance, Appellant fails to indicate the race of forty-seven of the 170 venirepersons. Without such information, there is no basis for a Batson claim. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Johnson, 542 Pa. 384, 668 A.2d 97 (1995), cert, denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 90, 136 L.Ed.2d 46 (1996). Furthermore, Appellant offers no evidence that the prosecutor exhibited racial animus in striking African-American venirepersons. Indeed, the impaneled jury included four African-American jurors and one African-American alternate, which indicates a lack of racial animus. Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise a plainly baseless Batson claim.\nf. Failure to object to \u201cbad character\u201d evidence\nAs part of Appellant\u2019s defense case, trial counsel presented nine \u201cgood character\u201d witnesses who testified that Appellant had a good reputation in the community for being honest, truthful, peaceable and law abiding. In rebuttal, the Commonwealth presented three \u201cbad character\u201d witnesses who testified that Appellant\u2019s reputation in the community was exactly the opposite. Two of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses were victims of robberies allegedly committed by Appellant, and the other was a police officer who was investigating the robberies. Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses because, he alleges, they were not members of Appellant\u2019s community and had no foundation for their testimony other than their knowledge of specific bad acts, to which they could not testify. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Scott, 496 Pa. 188, 436 A.2d 607 (1981).\nAppellant\u2019s argument has no merit. All three of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses testified that they knew people in Appellant\u2019s community and were familiar with Appellant\u2019s reputation among those people. Hence, trial counsel had no basis to object to their testimony regarding Appellant\u2019s reputation. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hansell, 185 Pa.Super. 443, 447,137 A.2d 816, 819 (1958) (citations omitted) (\u201cThe test [for admitting reputation evidence] is whether the witness knows the voice of the resident community [concerning the defendant\u2019s reputation].\u201d)\ng. Failure to investigate the Victim\u2019s school records\nIn his opening and closing statements, the prosecutor described the Victim as an aspiring college student. Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate the Victim\u2019s school records to determine whether her grades were good enough for her to go to college. This argument is baseless and warrants no further consideration.\nh. Failure to request a mistrial due to evidence of Appellant\u2019s unemployment\nOn direct examination, the prosecutor asked Appellant\u2019s father whether Appellant had ever worked during the two years Appellant had lived with him. The purpose of the question was to establish motive. Trial counsel objected to the question, and the trial court overruled the objection. The following day, the prosecutor brought to the court\u2019s attention caselaw holding that a defendant\u2019s unemployment may not be used to show motive. See Commonwealth v. Barkelbaugh, 526 Pa. 133, 584 A.2d 927 (1990); Commonwealth v. Haight, 514 Pa. 438, 525 A.2d 1199 (1987). The court gave the jury a curative instruction, directing them not to consider unemployment as a motive. Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a mistrial based on the erroneous admission of evidence of Appellant\u2019s unemployment.\nAppellant\u2019s argument has no merit. The trial court\u2019s curative instruction is presumed to be sufficient to cure any prejudice to Appellant, see, e.g., Commonwealth v. English, 548 Pa. 528, 699 A.2d 710 (1997), and he offers no evidence to rebut this presumption. Consequently, no relief is due.\ni. Failure to seek suppression of clothing\nPursuant to a valid search warrant, the police seized clothing from Appellant\u2019s father\u2019s home (where Appellant resided) that matched eyewitnesses\u2019 descriptions of clothing worn by the killer. The clothing was lost or destroyed before trial, and therefore was never introduced into evidence. Nevertheless, the prosecutor questioned Appellant and his father about the clothing. Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek suppression of the clothing, and for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s questions about it.\nAppellant\u2019s arguments have no merit. Because the clothing was lost or destroyed before trial, there was no need to seek its suppression; and, instead of objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s references to the clothing, trial counsel emphasized the absence of the clothing to derogate the credibility of the prosecutor\u2019s entire case. Trial counsel\u2019s strategy was clearly a reasonable attempt to advance Appellant\u2019s interests, and therefore cannot be deemed ineffective.\nj. Failure to object to the trial court\u2019s Kloiber instruction\nWith respect to identification testimony, the trial court instructed the jury that they \u201cshould receive the testimony with caution.\u201d Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object that, pursuant to Commonwealth v. Kloiber, 378 Pa. 412, 106 A.2d 820 (1954), the trial court was required to instruct the jury that they must receive the testimony with caution, not that they should do so. In this case, however, the three eyewitnesses who testified had protracted and unobstructed views of Appellant and consistently identified him as the killer throughout the investigation and at trial. Accordingly, there was no need for a Kloiber instruction, and the trial court\u2019s instruction that the jury \u201cshould receive the [identification] testimony with caution\u201d could only have benefited Appellant.\nk. Bolstering the prosecutor\u2019s credibility during closing argument\nDuring his closing argument, trial counsel made, inter alia, the following remarks:\nMr. King [the prosecutor] is probably the top prosecutor in [the District Attorney\u2019s Office], and certainly a gentleman I respect to the utmost---- But, ladies and gentlemen, as if his vast skills are not enough, in this case he has at his fingertips all of the vast resources of his own office, the District Attorney\u2019s Office---- But, ladies and gentlemen, what does James Dennis have? James Dennis simply had, ladies and gentlemen, the prayers of his family and me. That\u2019s it.\nN.T., October 15, 1992, at 52-53. Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for making these comments that disparaged his own skills and bolstered the credibility of the prosecutor. Appellant, however, does not demonstrate that trial counsel\u2019s strategy was unreasonable, nor that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s remarks. Hence, we cannot conclude that trial counsel was ineffective.\n1. Failure to object to evidence of Appellant\u2019s prior drug conviction\nDuring the penalty phase of the trial, the prosecutor presented the testimony of the court clerk, who erroneously testified that Appellant had been convicted of possession of crack cocaine with intent to deliver. In fact, Appellant had been convicted of simple possession. On cross-examination, trial counsel questioned the clerk about the error, and she corrected it. The trial court subsequently instructed the jury that, as a matter of law, Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, i.e., that Appellant had proven the mitigating factor of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(1). Although Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the clerk\u2019s testimony, in light of the trial court\u2019s instruction, Appellant could not have suffered any prejudice. Ergo, no relief is due.\nm. Failure to \u201clife qualify\u201d the jury\nDuring voir dire, the trial court, pursuant to Wither-spoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968), \u201cdeath qualified\u201d the jury by asking venirepersons whether any of them could not impose the death penalty under any circumstances. Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request that the court \u201clife qualify\u201d the jury, pursuant to Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992), by asking the venirepersons whether any of them would automatically vote for the death penalty if they found Appellant guilty of first degree murder. We have held, however, that counsel\u2019s failure to \u201clife qualify\u201d a jury constitutes ineffectiveness only where the defendant shows that one or more of the impaneled jurors would automatically impose the death penalty. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Morris, 546 Pa. 296, 684 A.2d 1037 (1996). Here, Appellant does not even attempt to meet this burden. Hence, the ineffectiveness claim fails.\n2. Prosecutor\u2019s Closing Argument in the Guilt Phase\nAppellant argues that improper comments in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument deprived him of a fair trial and violated his right to due process. To warrant relief, however, Appellant must show that, considering all the circumstances of the case, the unavoidable effect of the comments was to prejudice the jury against Appellant, causing them to form a fixed bias and hostility toward him such that they could not render a fair and impartial verdict. See Commonwealth v. Jones, 546 Pa. 161, 683 A.2d 1181 (1996). We have held that \u201cthe first and brightest line\u201d of impropriety in a closing argument is \u201cat the point where the language and inferences of the summation no longer relate back to the evidence on the record.\u201d Commonwealth v. Johnson, 516 Pa. 527, 530, 533 A.2d 994, 996 (1987). In this case, while we believe that some of the prosecutor\u2019s comments in his closing argument were inappropriate, we do not believe that the argument in its entirety crossed this line.\nWe begin by noting that the evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt was, by any estimate, quite overwhelming. The Commonwealth presented three eyewitnesses to the murder, and each positively identified Appellant as the perpetrator from a photo array, at a lineup, and again at trial. There was evidence that Appellant had a gun of the type used in the murder and clothing resembling that worn by the perpetrator. This Court has held that, \u201c[w]here evidence of guilt is overwhelming, a prejudicial remark by the prosecutor will not be grounds for reversal.\u201d Commonwealth v. Carter, 537 Pa. 233, 643 A.2d 61, 76 (1994). See also Commonwealth v. White, 515 Pa. 348, 528 A.2d 596, 599 (1987). Consequently, Appellant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct has one strike against it from the outset.\nAppellant first complains of the following remarks:\nIn this case, ladies and gentlemen, let\u2019s get back to why I am standing up here talking to you. Sometimes I realize that there are people who are happy in their jobs, there are children who are happy, there are people able to go to sleep without locking their doors, where young ladies can walk the street at night and not be afraid, and where young ladies could, in fact, be young ladies.\nMr. Mandell [defense counsel] mentioned motive. Must there be a motive? Are we coming to a situation of the haves against the have nots? Are we coming to a situation that when you get up in the morning and decide what to wear, what jewelry to wear, that you put a target on your chest and on your back? \u2019Cause this is what this case is about.\nThis case is about right and this case is about freedom. We\u2019re talking about the right that is right. We\u2019re talking about the right to take public transportation. We\u2019re talking about the right to be able to use public transportation without the fear of someone waiting to get paid, someone waiting to rip you off. \u2019Cause this is what this case is about, ladies and gentlemen. It\u2019s not about race, it\u2019s not about size and height. What it\u2019s about, ladies and gentlemen, is this. A young lady named Chedell Williams. Another way of putting it would be something such as this. That my best witness is not here. That\u2019s why I\u2019m standing here.\nN.T., October 15,1992, at 87-90.\nAlthough these comments strayed somewhat from the evidence, and were therefore inappropriate, we cannot conclude that their unavoidable effect was to prejudice the jury against Appellant to the extent that they could not render a true verdict. Indeed, we have previously allowed similar remarks about the impact of a defendant\u2019s actions on the community. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Thompson, 538 Pa. 297, 648 A.2d 315, 323 (1994) (Prosecutor\u2019s remark that, \u201cwhat we are really talking about is beyond those walls, beyond those windows, spilling out into the streets of North Philadelphia, where ordinary people walk, live, breathe and die, every day,\u201d was not improper); Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 460 Pa. 686, 334 A.2d 588, 593 (1975) (Although the comments were inappropriate, the jury could still render a fair verdict where the prosecutor commented that, \u201cit\u2019s difficult at best to live in a community of Philadelphia where crime has been so rampant that people are afraid to walk the streets. Women are afraid to go out after dark. Men are afraid to walk their dogs or go to the corner to put a letter in the mail box. Something must be done about this sort of thing.\u201d).\nNext, Appellant focuses on the following passages:\nIn an urban situation, Ladies and Gentlemen, it\u2019s now popular to use cliches. Back in a drug epidemic, somebody said, \u2018just say no.\u2019 And all the citizens were up in arms following \u2018just say no.\u2019 Then at another time, someone said, \u2018get involved.\u2019 And then what people call the ghetto code, I don\u2019t see anything, I don\u2019t know anything, I don\u2019t want to become involved.\nAnd believe me, Ladies and Gentlemen, at this time when the male role in the community is questioned, it is refreshing to see two men like Mr. Cameron and Mr. Bertha stand up, out of outrage, stand up, because someone has to stand up, with the degree that our young people are laid down.\nTwo finger rings, one gold chain, earlobes bleeding from where the earrings were snatched. Did she leave a legacy? I hope she did. And it\u2019s not in a \u2014 it\u2019s not in a slogan or cliche, don\u2019t wear jewelry. It\u2019s not in a slang and it\u2019s not in a cliche, if you wear jewelry go in a group. What this is about, ladies and gentlemen, is stopping the person from trying to take advantage. Wearing earrings when they sell you those earrings, they don\u2019t put a sign on them that says, wearing these earrings might be hazardous to your life. But that\u2019s the reality under which we now live.\nN.T., October 15,1992, at 92-98.\nThese excerpts, however, present an incomplete and distorted picture of the prosecutor\u2019s full closing argument. It is fundamental that, \u201cin order to evaluate whether [the prosecutor\u2019s] comments were improper, we must look at the context in which they were made.\u201d Commonwealth v. Morales, 549 Pa. 400, 424, 701 A.2d 516, 528 (1997). See also Commonwealth v. Carpenter, 533 Pa. 40, 617 A.2d 1263, 1267 (1992). Here, Appellant overlooks the fact that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were interspersed with commentary specifically pertaining to the testimony presented at trial:\nYou heard the truth from the friend, Miss Howard. She was there.... [Defense counsel] stands up and he says, that\u2019s not enough. Because she said, \u201cI think.\u201d You saw her on the stand, ladies and gentlemen. Was she lying? Was she evasive? Did she stand strong? Did at any time she say, this is not the man?\nBut our evidence didn\u2019t stop there. In an urban situation, Ladies and Gentlemen, it\u2019s now popular to use cliches. Back in a drug epidemic, somebody said, \u2018just say no.\u2019 And all the citizens were up in arms following \u2018just say no.\u2019 Then at another time, someone said, \u2018get involved.\u2019 And then what people call the ghetto code, I don\u2019t see anything, I don\u2019t know anything, I don\u2019t want to become involved. In this case, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would hasten to add that wasn\u2019t the case. You have Zahra Howard, the friend, you have James Cameron, the bus driver, you have Thomas Bertha, the contractor. Why did they get involved? Because something happened that should not have happened. Something happened that was tragic. And maybe, as my grandmother once said, if you can\u2019t stand for something, you\u2019ll fall for anything. And in this particular case, I would submit to you that you witnessed a show. That show didn\u2019t come from this side of the room, but it came from that side of the room.\nMiss Howard, thank you for coming forward. Charles Thompson, he came in here. Yeah, he\u2019s the only person I called that had some kind, of taint on him. He has an open case involving drugs. But who is a friend of? What group is he a member of?\nOh yeah, I\u2019m the prosecutor in this case. I call the shots. I decided who you would hear, the form of the evidence you would hear. I would submit to you that you heard from the witnesses. You saw what there was to see.\nN.T., October 15,1992, at 91-92 (emphasis added).\nConsidering these remarks in context, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor strayed so far from the evidence that Appellant was deprived of a fair trial. On the contrary, the remarks are well within the bounds prescribed by Johnson, supra. See also Commonwealth v. Ragan, 538 Pa. 2, 645 A.2d 811 (1994) (Taken in context, prosecutor\u2019s comments focused on the evidence, and therefore warranted no relief).\nSimilarly, the final passage of which Appellant complains focused primarily on the evidence of record:\nAs I sit down, ladies and gentlemen, the buck stops right here. And I\u2019m not talking about the buck that goes up and down, I\u2019m talking about the buck that you are. You are this community. You are the Commonwealth. This case is entitled the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania versus James Dennis. These are your streets. This is your town. The victims, the witnesses, and the defendants are products of a system that we all support. Mr. Lincoln said, \u2018judgment falls on a person when there\u2019s something within that person we cannot abide.\u2019 I would submit to you that\u2019s greed and murder. If you believe the witnesses and if you believe them when they say James Dennis is the man, that\u2019s the man, that\u2019s his face, it was a gun like this, he had a gun like this in his waistband, forget the would have, should have, could haves and deal with it.... In this case, I submit to you, Miss Williams suffers in any final solution. Miss Williams is dead, and the evidence shows that James Dennis killed her. The Commonwealth asks you for a verdict of guilty of murder in the first degree. We will not compromise where, I submit to you, that was a cold blooded act of murder, willful, deliberate, and intentional, based on the testimony of the witnesses and the doctor. Thank you. And as I said in my opening, stick a fork in him and turn him over. He will be done when you say he is done.\nN.T., October 15,1992, at 102-04 (emphasis added).\nAs we noted in Hamilton, supra, the prosecutor should not have couched his argument in terms of general societal problems to the extent that he did. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the fact that the focus of the argument consistently returned to the abundant evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt. The Commonwealth presented three credible witnesses who testified with unyielding certainty that they saw Appellant shoot Chedell Williams, and the prosecutor made this testimony the core of his closing argument. Consequently, we cannot conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks so prejudiced the jury against Appellant that they could not evaluate the evidence fairly and impartially.\nFurthermore, we note that the trial court repeatedly warned the jury that they must put aside emotion and decide the case solely on the evidence:\nThis case is not to be concerned or governed by emotion, it\u2019s to be governed strictly by the evidence, and your decision is to rely strictly on the evidence and not on emotions.\nConsider the issues in this case fairly, impartially, and without passion, prejudice or sympathy---- You must be very careful in analyzing what the evidence is and using all of those faculties in determining what the true facts are in this case. And I can\u2019t stress too strongly that that has to be decided without sympathy or emotion.\nIn trying to find the truth about a matter, the first thing that you do is examine the evidence, coldly and dispassionately, without sympathy for one side or the other. You\u2019re like a scientist. All you\u2019re interested in is to find the truth, unaffected by any other consideration.\nThese instructions were more than sufficient to eliminate any prejudice caused by the prosecutor\u2019s comments. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Scarpino, 494 Pa. 421, 431 A.2d 926, 932 (1981) (\u201cAny possible prejudice [caused by the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument] was addressed and eliminated by the trial judge\u2019s prompt attention to the matter.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 496 Pa. 546, 437 A.2d 1175, 1177-78 (1981) (\u201c[T]he judge\u2019s cautionary instruction covered any emotional appeal contained in [one of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks] as well as the other references to which trial counsel objected.\u201d).\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances \u2014 overwhelming evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt, the prosecutor\u2019s consistent references to the evidence, and the trial court\u2019s ample cautionary instructions \u2014 we cannot conclude that the unavoidable effect of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was to prejudice the jury against Appellant such that they could not render a fair and impartial verdict. Accordingly, we grant no relief.\n3. Prosecutor\u2019s Closing Argument in the Penalty Phase\nAppellant also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument in the penalty phase was unduly prejudicial. We review the prosecutor\u2019s remarks to determine whether \u201cthe sentence of death may have been the product of passion, prejudice or in any way arbitrary.\u201d Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 54, 454 A.2d 937, 958 (1982), cert, denied, 461 U.S. 970, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327 (1983); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3).\nFirst, Appellant argues that the prosecutor improperly \u201cinjected himself into the process\u201d by commenting on the fact that he cancelled a planned vacation so he could participate in the sentencing hearing, by referring to his own feelings about the case, and by stating that he \u201cowe[d] it to the memory of Chedell Williams, and ... to the family\u201d to be present at the sentencing hearing. Although Appellant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comments amounted to \u201ca personal vouching that the death penalty was the only appropriate sentence,\u201d this interpretation has absolutely no foundation. We can discern no prejudice as a result of these remarks.\nAppellant further argues that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the passions of the jury, e.g., by comparing Appellant\u2019s age (twenty-one) to that of the Victim (seventeen) and urging the jury to reject age as a mitigating factor, by discounting Appellant\u2019s mitigation witnesses, and by repeatedly exhorting the jury to \u201cstop Jimmy Dennis.\u201d Again, Appellant fails to show any prejudice as a result of these comments, particularly in light of the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury that, \u201cyour decision should not be based on any feeling of vengeance, it should not be based on prejudice.... Your decision should be based on the evidence and the fact of the inferences that reasonably flow from the evidence.\u201d N.T., October 19, 1992, at 141. As we held in Commonwealth v. Chambers, 528 Pa. 558, 581-82, 599 A.2d 630, 641-42 (1991):\nThere is nothing improper in the prosecutor arguing the appropriateness of the death penalty because that is the only issue before the jury at the penalty phase of the trial. [Citation omitted]. In the case at bar, the trial judge determined that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were not prejudicial .... Further, the judge reminded the jury of their duty under the law and that their determination of the facts, not the beliefs of counsel, governed the outcome of the case. These instructions put the prosecutor\u2019s comments into their proper context and dispel any argument of prosecutorial misconduct.\nThus, we find no impropriety in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument.\n4. After-discovered Evidence\nAppellant argues that he is entitled to a remand for consideration of after-discovered evidence. To warrant relief, after-discovered evidence must meet a four-prong test: (1) the evidence could not have been obtained before the conclusion of the trial by reasonable diligence; (2) the evidence is not merely corroborative or cumulative; (3) the evidence will not be used solely for purposes of impeachment; and (4) the evidence is of such a nature and character that a different outcome is likely. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. McCracken, 540 Pa. 541, 659 A.2d 541 (1995); Commonwealth v. Wilson, 538 Pa. 485, 649 A.2d 435 (1994). Here, neither of Appellant\u2019s two items of after-discovered evidence meet this test.\nFirst, Appellant argues that the case should be remanded to consider the statement of Shanaqua Ramsey, a friend of Zahra Howard, one of the eyewitnesses to the murder. On April 3, 1997, Ramsey gave an affidavit in which she stated that when Zahra Howard returned to school after the murder, she told Ramsey that she was not sure if the person she identified (Appellant) was the killer because she did not get a good look at the killer. Ramsey\u2019s statement fails to meet at least two prongs of the after-discovered evidence test: the alleged conversation between Ramsey and Zahra Howard took place nearly a year before trial, and there is no evidence that it was discoverable only after trial; and the evidence would only be used to impeach Zahra Howard. Hence, this claim warrants no relief.\nNext, Appellant argues that a remand is necessary to consider the January 24, 1996 statement of Charles Thompson, in which Thompson recanted his statement to the police about seeing Appellant with a gun, and claimed that he lied on the witness stand during the prosecutor\u2019s direct examination. Recantation, however, is notoriously unreliable, particularly where the witness claims to have committed perjury. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. McNeil, 506 Pa. 607, 487 A.2d 802 (1985). Moreover, there is no indication that the substance of Thompson\u2019s statement could not have been elicited on cross-examination at trial. Hence, no relief is due.\n5. Remand for Evidentiary Hearing on the Batson Issue\nAppellant argues that he is entitled to a remand for consideration of the Batson issue. This argument is meritless. See Issue 1(e), supra.\n6. Remand to Complete Discovery\nAppellant argues that he has had difficulty obtaining discovery in this case, and, therefore, the case should be remanded to ensure that the record is complete. This argument is completely without foundation, and therefore warrants no further consideration.\n7. Proportionality of Sentence\nFinally, Appellant argues that the case should be remanded for a new sentencing hearing because, he alleges, his sentence is disproportionate to the sentence in similar cases. This argument is patently without merit. A sentence of death is not uncommon where the defendant has committed a robbery that results in murder. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Uderra, 550 Pa. 389, 706 A.2d 334 (1998); Commonwealth v. Harris, 550 Pa. 92, 703 A.2d 441 (1997); Commonwealth v. Hall, 549 Pa. 269, 701 A.2d 190 (1997), cert, denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 1534, 140 L.Ed.2d 684 (1998); Commonwealth v. Washington, 549 Pa. 12, 700 A.2d 400 (1997); Common wealth v. Gibson, 547 Pa. 71, 688 A.2d 1152, cert denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 118 S.Ct. 364, 139 L.Ed.2d 284 (1997).\nCONCLUSION\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, we affirm Appellant\u2019s convictions for first degree murder, robbery, criminal conspiracy, violating the Uniform Firearms Act, and possessing an instrument of crime, and we affirm his death sentence.\nZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion in which FLAHERTY, C.J., and SAYLOR, J., join.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6101 etseq.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 907.\n. Although Appellant does not raise the issue, pursuant to Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 454 A.2d 937 (1982), cert, denied, 461 U.S. 970, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327 (1983), we are required to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to sustain Appellant's conviction. Here, three eyewitnesses positively identified Appellant as the perpetrator, and there was evidence that Appellant had a gun and clothing resembling those of the killer. Thus, the evidence was more than sufficient to sustain Appellant\u2019s convictions for first degree murder and related crimes.\n. Although the murder weapon was never recovered, a ballistics expert testified that there was a ninety-nine percent (99%) chance that the bullet that killed the Victim was fired from a Harrington and Richardson handgun.\n. The jury was not informed of the witness\u2019 specific history with Appellant. Instead, the witnesses merely testified as people who knew Appellant's reputation in the community.\n. Appellant also alleges that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the introduction of his school records and for failing to object to the prosecutor's intimation that his alibi defense was fabricated. These claims are patently meritless, and therefore warrant no further comment.\n. N.T., October 15, 1992, at 91.\n. Id. at 107.\n. Id. at 114."}
