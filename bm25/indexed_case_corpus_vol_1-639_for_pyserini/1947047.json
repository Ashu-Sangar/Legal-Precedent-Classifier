{"id": "1947047", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Mandeeino,\nAppellant, Norman M. Jackson, was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to serve not less than ten nor more than twenty years. In this appeal from the judgment of sentence, the only question raised is whether the trial court unfairly participated in the trial as an advocate and thereby deprived the appellant of an impartial jury trial.\nAppellant gave a statement in which he admitted that he shot the victim during a fight in the appellant\u2019s apartment. According to the appellant\u2019s statement, a fight began when the victim refused to engage in homosexual relations with the appellant\u2019s roommate because he was black. Appellant stated that he accidently shot the deceased during the fight. The prosecution introduced evidence establishing that the shooting was not accidental. In order to establish a modus operandi, one of the witnesses called by the Commonwealth was Eichard Yos. He testified that he had once been invited to the appellant\u2019s apartment where he was robbed and stabbed by the appellant and his roommate.\nMany of the alleged errors raised by the appellant concerned questions by the trial court when Yos was testifying.\nOn one occasion, Yos, who had testified about knife wounds he received from the appellant, was asked to stand up and point to the area of injury on his chest. After Yos pointed out the areas, the court asked if there was a scar and when Yos replied in the affirmative the court suggested that the scar be exhibited. As the scars were being shown to the jury, defense counsel peered at the scars and shrugged his shoulders. Defense counsel admits that he was' attempting to convey to the jury the minor and inconsequential nature of the scars. Defense counsel was admonished by the court. The court said, \u201c. . . If you have a comment to make, you may cross-examine the witness, but don\u2019t cater to the gallery. This is no joking matter. . . .\u201d\nWe do not agree that the above described participation by the judge constituted error. When the trial court asked about the scar and suggested that the scar be shown, the subject matter of the knife wounds had already been opened up. The trial court did not introduce any new area of inquiry. The trial court had no knowledge about the existence or non-existence of the scars when the request was made. We do not think that the trial court unduly participated as an advocate for the prosecution.\nThe court\u2019s admonishment of defense counsel for shrugging his shoulders after looking at the scars was not an improper comment. Defense counsel was not on the witness stand and his gesture admittedly was to convey an opinion to the jury. We find no error in this matter.\nThe next objection raised by the appellant concerns a comment by the trial court when defense counsel was attempting to impeach Vos\u2019 character by showing that Vos was incarcerated in a State Penitentiary. Defense counsel made several references to a State Penitentiary as the place of Vos\u2019 incarceration. The court interrupted and stated, \u201c. . . I don\u2019t think it is referred to as a State Penitentiary, it is a State Correctional Institution and it is a minimum security institution. . . .\u201d This reference by the trial court was an accurate statement. We note that Vos had already testified that he was incarcerated in a minimum security institution. The court\u2019s statement was not an unfairly prejudicial comment.\nThe next objection raised by defense counsel also occurred during the cross-examination of Vos. Defense counsel was inquiring as to whether Vos had ever seen anybody in the Sportshaven Bar who was a businessman carrying a brief case who had arrived in a chauffeur-driven automobile. This question was asked by defense counsel because Vos had previously testified that after meeting appellant at the Sportshaven Bar, the appellant called for his chauffeured-driven automobile. The court interrupted and said, \u201c. . . If he were in the bar, how would he see how they arrived? I don\u2019t know whether this bar has transparent windows where he would see how they came in or not, you might inquire. . . .\u201d According to defense counsel, this interference by the trial court was helpful to the witness. We note, however, that the trial court ended its comment by suggesting that defense counsel should first inquire as to whether or not Vos was in a position to see people arriving at the Bar and in what vehicle they might have arrived. The court\u2019s statement was not unfairly prejudicial.\nAlso during the cross-examination of Vos, defense counsel in one of his questions asked Vos whether he went off with \u201c. . . this millionaire. . .\u201d in the chauffeured-driven automobile. The court then interrupted and inquired whether there was any testimony in the case about a millionaire. There was no such testimony in the case. This reference in defense counsel\u2019s question was not a reference taken from testimony previously in evidence and we can see no error.\nThe last objection raised involving Vos\u2019 testimony concerns the court\u2019s remarks after an objection by the. prosecuting attorney had been sustained. At that point, the defense counsel began to speak and the court stated, . . Did you hear the ruling? Then, don\u2019t argue with the court afterwards. In the first place, you asked the question about two or three times. You will not characterize witnesses\u2019s testimony whether it be yours or anybody else. The jury hears the testimony and they will pass upon it, it is not for you to say. . . .\u201d We do not consider the trial court\u2019s comment as prejudicial.\nIn addition to the objections recited above, all of which occurred during the testimony of the witness Vos, defense counsel objects to a question that the judge asked while defense counsel was closing to the jury. During his closing to the jury, defense counsel told the jury that the defendant had given a statement and . . the statement is the reason the defendant didn\u2019t take the stand, because it tells his story. . . .\u201d Immediately after the defense counsel made his statement to the jury, the court interrupted and inquired, \u201c. . . Well now, just a moment, Counsel, are you standing on the statement or are you questioning the statement? We simply want to know. You have a right to do whatever you want, but I am not certain of your position here. . . .\u201d After the trial court\u2019s question, defense counsel answered that he was just questioning what parts of the statement were accurate and which were not. Defense counsel further stated that \u201c. . . I am not willing to accept it all or to discard it all. . . .\u201d After this response the court replied, \u201c . . All right.. . .\u201d We do not see any prejudice in the court\u2019s question.\nAnother error alleged by defense counsel occurred during the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury. In reviewing the testimony, the trial court stated that the appellant had said in his statement that he had called for his chauffeur who later arrived and met appellant and the victim and drove them to the apartment. This was an error by the judge in reviewing the testimony. The appellant did not admit this version of the events of the evening. It was Vos, while testifying, who stated that the appellant had called for his chauffeured-driven car to drive them to the appellant\u2019s apartment. There is no doubt that this was a factual error by the trial court. We do not, however, consider that it is reversible error. After the charge, the trial court asked counsel if anything had been misstated, or omitted ox* overlooked. Following an off the record discussion, the court informed the jury that part of his charge about defendant\u2019s statement was incorrect. The court then said that it was one of the witnesses who testified about the chauffeur. In its charge the trial court also made it quite clear to the jury that their recollection of the facts was controlling and they were to rely on their recollection and not the trial court\u2019s recollection if they felt the trial court had made a mistake.\nWe have reviewed other objections raised by the appellant involving questions by the trial court during expert testimony and find that the trial court- did not unfairly participate in any of the questioning.\nWe have read the entire testimony of this trial and examined the trial court\u2019s participation at those points claimed by defense counsel to be error. Considering the entire trial, the charge and the closing addresses, we do not find any grounds for reversing the judgment of sentence. The trial court did not participate as an advocate in any way which, deprived the appellant of his right to trial by an impartial court and jury.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nMr. Justice Pomeroy concurs in the result."}
