{"id": "912475", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe respondent admitted in her testimony that when she left her husband she intended to leave him forever. She went away to remote regions, Chicago and San Francisco, and was gone between two and three years, long enough to bring herself within the operation of the divorce law. We think the testimony shows that her desertion of her husband was wilful and malicious, and he was therefore entitled to a decree.\nDecree affirmed."}
