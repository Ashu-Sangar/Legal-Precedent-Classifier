{"id": "1753767", "contents": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nOn April 22, 1971, appellant\u2019s husband, a voluntary fireman in the Collingdale Fire Company for over twelve years, responded with other members of said fire company to a fire. While fighting this fire, appellant\u2019s husband collapsed and he subsequently was pronounced dead on arrival at a local hospital. The cause of death was a coronary .occlusion brought on by exposure to fire and by the excitement and extreme exertion of fighting a fire.\nAppellant filed a claim for benefits for herself as surviving widow and her four children under The Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act, Act of June 21, 1939, P.L. 566, No. 284, \u00a7 101 et seq., as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7 1201 et seq. (1978-79 Supp.) (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d), alleging that her husband\u2019s death was caused by an \u201coccupational disease\u201d. Following a hearing, a referee awarded the requested compensation which award was affirmed by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board. The Delaware County Court of Common Pleas affirmed the Board\u2019s decision and upon further appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed the Court of Common Pleas\u2019 decision, holding that volunteer firemen are not entitled to compensation under the Act. Commonwealth v. Bley, 28 Pa.Cmwlth. 342, 368 A.2d 872 (1977). We reverse. Volunteer firemen are entitled to compensation under the Act.\nIn construing a statute, we are governed by the Statutory Construction Act of 1972, Act of December 6, 1972, No. 290, \u00a7 3 et seq., 1 Pa.C.S.A. 1501 et seq. (1978-79 Supp.) which provides, among other things, that \u201cthe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d \u00a7 1921(a); \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d \u00a7 1921(b); and section 1921(c) provides that if \u201cthe words of the statute are not explicit, the intention of the General Assembly may be ascertained by considering, among other matters: . (3) The mischief to be remedied . . .\u201d and \u201c(5) The former law, if any, including other statutes upon the same or similar subjects.\u201d\nThe relevant sections of the Pennsylvania Occupational Disease Act (the Act) are Sections 1201 and 1208(o).\nSection 1201 provides that the Act \u201cshall apply to disabilities and deaths caused by occupational disease as defined in this act, resulting from employment within this Commonwealth, irrespective of the place where the contract of hiring was made, renewed, or extended, and shall not apply to any such disabilities and deaths resulting from employment outside of the Commonwealth.\u201d\nSection 1208 provides in pertinent part:\n\u201cThe term \u2018occupational disease\u2019 as used in this act, shall mean only the following diseases:\u201d\nThere then follows a list of diseases and occupations numbered subsections (a) through (o). Our concern is with subsection (o) of section 1208 which provides:\n\u201cDiseases of the heart and lungs, resulting in either temporary or permanent disability or death after four years or more of service in firefighting for the benefit and safety of the public, caused by extreme overexertion in times of stress or danger or by exposure to heat, smoke fumes or gases, or arising directly out of the employment of any such fireman. The Commonwealth shall pay the full amount of compensation for the disability under the clause.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nThere is no doubt that the deceased had \u201cfour years or more of service in firefighting for the benefit of the public\u201d and that he died in a manner set forth in the statute [\u00a7 1208(o)]. The Commonwealth contends, however, that the language of section 1201 which provides \u201c . . . deaths caused by occupational diseases . . . resulting from employment within this Commonwealth . . . \u201d and the language of section 1208(o) which provides \u201ccaused by extreme overexertion in times of stress or danger or by exposure to heat, smoke, fumes or gases, or arising directly out of the employment of any such fireman\u201d means that for a fireman to recover under this Act, he must have been in a paid employment situation. Thus, continues the Commonwealth, as decedent was a volunteer, he was not in an employment situation and hence, was not covered by the Act. This argument fails because the word \u201cemployment \u201d as used in the Act refers to the manner of death as opposed to the relationship of the fireman to those he serves or is answerable to. This is so as to preclude a fireman from recovering benefits from a fire that has nothing to do with his area of service (fireman\u2019s house burns down and he dies as a result thereof while sleeping or a fireman dies while fighting a fire in another state or a fireman dies while viewing a movie when the theater burns down).\nOur interpretation is further supported by the fact that prior to 1965, Section 1208(o) provided:\n\u201cDiseases of the heart and lung, resulting in death after four years or more of service in the full time salaried occupation of firefighting for the safety of the public caused by extreme overexertion . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nIn 1965, section 1208(o) was amended [Act of December 17, 1965. P.L. 1121, \u00a7 1, 77 P.S. \u00a7 1208(o) (1978-79 Supp.)] by the legislature to delete the words \u201cthe full time salaried occupation of\u201d and now read as set forth supra. Thus, the legislature removed the requirement of a firefighter being a full-time employee and a salaried or paid employee in order to recover under the Act.\nAdditionally, we are aware, just as the legislature was aware when they enacted the aforesaid deletion, that firefighting, whether paid or voluntary, is an extremely hazardous occupation. Firemen risk their lives for us, the citizens. We work, sleep and go about our business and pleasure in a relative degree of comfort because we know that our firemen are willing to take this, risk to protect us and our loved ones. In interpreting this Act, it is rather inconceivable that the legislature did not want to give all firemen an equal degree of comfort; that is, a knowledge that if they should die in the line of duty, their loved ones will be compensated in some manner. We adopt the language of the Superior Court in Butler v. United States Steel Corp., 205 Pa.Super. 508, 211 A.2d 35 (1965) \u2014 \u201cThe Occupational Disease Act must be liberally construed to effectuate its remedial and humanitarian purposes.\u201d See, 1 Pa.C.S.A. 1928(c).\nLastly, the Commonwealth contends that to allow recovery in cases such as this may threaten the financial integrity of the Act. [Citing Herman v. Kandrat Coal Co., 205 Pa.Super. 117, 208 A.2d 51 (1965)]. No evidence of such a threat has been submitted in this case. We note, however, that if all municipalities converted from a volunteer fire department to a \u201cfull time salaried\u201d fire department, taxes would have to be raised substantially.\nReversed.\nO'BRIEN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nNIX, J., filed a concurring opinion in which MANDERINO, J., joins.\nEAGEN, C.
