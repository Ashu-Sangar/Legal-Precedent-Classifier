{"id": "1048565", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal by the plaintiff below is from the dismissal of his exceptions to the partnership account filed by the defendant. They were vague and indefinite, failing to specify any particular error or errors in the account, and nothing appears in either of the two assignments before ns directing our attention to any specific error that ought to be corrected. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed, at appellant\u2019s costs."}
