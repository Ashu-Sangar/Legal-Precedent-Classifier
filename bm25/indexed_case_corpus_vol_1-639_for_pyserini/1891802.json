{"id": "1891802", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThe inception of this controversy was the municipal election held on November 5, 1963, in Northumberland County. \u201cAmong other officers to have been elected at that election was the entire board of county commissioners, and, consequently, the two judges of the court of common pleas of the county acted as the return board to compute and canvass the votes: Pennsylvania Election Code, Act of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, \u00a71403, as amended (25 P.S. \u00a73153) (hereinafter referred to as the Election Code).\n\u201cThere were four candidates for the three offices of county commissioner and prior to the computation and canvassing of the ballots of absentee electors it appeared that Oscar E. Kehler (D) had received 19,626 votes; W. Fred Kohler, Jr. (R) 19,480 votes; George F. Perles [Perles] (D) 19,060 votes; and Fred E. Hoffman [Hoffman] (R) 18,729 votes. The ballots of absentee electors received by the county board of elections (and not then counted) totalled 765.\u201d\n146 of the absentee ballots were rejected by the board of elections as bearing postmarks later than election day: See Election Code \u00a7\u00a71305-B and 1307-B, 25 P.S. \u00a7\u00a73149.5 and 3149.7. As the remaining ballots were removed from their outer envelopes, counsel for Perles began to challenge, ultimately challenging 485 of the remaining 619 votes. These challenges were overruled. \u201cAfter all of the ballots of absentee electors had been thus canvassed (and with the apparent agreement of all parties including the interested candidates, their attorneys and watchers, the tabulators, the county chairmen of the two major political parties, and the two common pleas judges sitting as a return board) the still-sealed inner envelopes containing the overruled, challenged ballots were commingled with the envelopes containing unchallenged ballots and at that point they were all opened and the ballots therein counted.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Perles received votes on 96 of the absentee ballots and Hoffman on 505. When these ballots were tabulated with the other ballots cast, the final result was a victory for Hoffman by 78 votes.\nThe counting of the absentee ballots was concluded on November 17, 1963, and the votes were tallied on November 18 and 19. On November 22, 1963, the board signed the official books which confirmed the results of the canvass and computation of the absentee ballots. On November 22, 1963, Perles filed an appeal, and Hoffman moved to dismiss the appeal as having been untimely filed. On December 3, 1963, the two law judges of Northumberland County disqualified themselves from hearing the appeal because they had previously acted as the return board in the election. This Court then appointed Judge R. Dixon Herman of the 12th Judicial District to specially preside in the matter. Argument was held on December 18, 1963, and on January 2, 1964, the appeal was dismissed and the order of the County Return Board affirmed. It is from this action of the court below that Perles now appeals.\nOur review of this case is in the nature of narrow certiorari. As Mr. Justice Eagen, speaking for this Court, stated in Meell Appeal, 405 Pa. 184, 185, 174 A. 2d 110, a case wherein the validity of certain absentee ballots was challenged: \u201cThe appeal from the order of the election board to the court of common pleas was pursuant to the provisions of the Act of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, \u00a71407, 25 PS \u00a73157. This statute provides, \u2018No appeal shall be allowed or granted from any order or decree of the court of common pleas made in pursuance of this section.\u2019\n\u201cThe scope of review, therefore, in this Court is in the nature of narrow certiorari and the inquiry is limited to a determination of whether or not the court had jurisdiction; whether or not the proceedings were regular; whether or not the court exceeded its power and authority; and, whether or not there was a violation of constitutional rights. The question of the validity of ballots involved is not for us to say: [citing cases].\u201d (Emphasis supplied).\nIt appears that Perles is now asking us, by couching his argument in terms of \u201cjurisdiction\u201d and \u201cauthority\u201d, to pass again upon the validity of the ballots. This we cannot do: Meell, supra.\nAn examination of the instant record indicates that the court below did have jurisdiction and did not exceed its authority.\nPerles urges that the manner of the application by the court below of Article XIII-B of the Election Code to the general election of 1963 is in violation of Article 8, \u00a7\u00a74, 7 and 19 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. This question is now raised for the first time and for that reason cannot now be considered. As we said in Archbishop O\u2019Hara\u2019s Appeal, 389 Pa. 35, 46, 131 A. 2d 587: \u201cIt is well settled that, as to appellants, \u2018matters not raised in, or considered by, the court below cannot be invoked on appeal even though they involve constitutional questions\u2019: [citing cases].\u201d\nIt may not be amiss to note that even if our scope of review did permit us to inquire into the validity of the ballots and, upon such inquiry, we determined that some of the ballots were invalid, such a determination would not require the elimination of all the absentee ballots, as urged by the appellant. This is an instance where one rotten apple does not spoil the entire barrel. The envelopes containing the votes, to which challenges were made and overruled, were mingled with the unchallenged votes and all the absentee ballots were opened and counted. As a result, there is no possible manner whereby we could determine which votes, if any, were cast illegally.\nThe disfranchisement of even one person validly exercising his right to vote is an extremely serious matter. If, assuming, arguendo, some but not all of the ballots were invalid, and we should declare all the absentee ballots void because of the few that might be invalid, we would be disfranchising a large number of voters whose votes have not been shown to be invalid. In Norwood Election Contest Case, 382 Pa. 547, 552, 116 A. 2d 552, this Court stated: \u201cEvery rationalization within the realm of common sense should aim at saving the ballot rather than voiding it. Speaking to this very point, Chief Justice Maxey stated in the Bauman case [Batman Election Contest Case, 351 Pa. 451, 454, 41 A. 2d 630]: 'The power to throw out a ballot for minor irregularities, like the power to throw out the entire poll of an election district for irregularities, must be exercised very sparingly and with the idea in mind that either an individual voter or a group of voters are not to be disfranchised at an election except for compelling reasons.\u2019 \u201d\nOrder affirmed. Costs on appellant.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell and Mr. Justice Roberts concur in the result.\nFrom the opinion of the court below. Record pp. 69a and 70a.\nThe challenges which Perles asserts in his argument on appeal to this Court are instances where ballots were counted (a) where the absentee electors had indicated on the Official Absentee Form that they required assistance in voting (there is no proof that such assistance was offered or received) ; (b) where the Official Application and Official Declaration were signed by the elector\u2019s mark, rather than his signature; (c) where there was no reason marked on the official form for the elector\u2019s absence from the polls; (d) where the elector had failed to \u201cmark out\u201d a reason for his or her absence on the official absentee form, but placed a small \u201cx\u201d alongside the reason of unavoidable absence because of business, occupation or duty, therefore, allegedly, making it impossible to conclude which reason the elector was indicating; (e) where, as interpreted by the court below, the reason for the elector\u2019s absence was that of occupation or, business, the date appearing on the application opposite the elector\u2019s signature was different than that appearing opposite the Chief Clerk\u2019s signature, therefore, allegedly, showing that the elector did not apply in person for his absentee ballot.\nFrom the opinion of the court below. Record p. 71a.\nAct of June 3, 1937, P. B. 1333, \u00a71301-B, added Act of January 8, 1960, P. B. (1959) 2135, \u00a72, as amended, 25 P.S. \u00a7\u00a73149.1-3149.8. The Act of August 13, 1963, P. B. 707, No. 379, effective January 1, 1964, is not applicable in this controversy.\nUnder Section 1407 of the Election Code, supra (25 P.S. \u00a73157(a)), it is provided: \u201cAny person aggrieved by any order or decision of any county board regarding the computation or canvassing of the returns of any primary or election . . . may appeal therefrom within two Hays after such order or decision shall have been made, whether then reduced to writing or not, to the court of common pleas of the proper county . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied). The \u201corder\u201d of the county board in the case at bar was made November 17, 1963. The appeal of Perles was taken on November 22, 1963, more than two days after the board\u2019s order. On this ground, the appeal of Perles was subject to dismissal,"}
