{"id": "1787742", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nThe parties in the instant appeal frame the issues as being whether Section 602 of the Health Care Services Malpractice Act (Act), Act of October 15, 1975, P.L. 390, as amended, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1301.602 (Supp.1983-84), applies to medical malpractice cases settled within the exclusive jurisdiction of the common pleas courts. We need not address this issue, however, inasmuch as the arbitration process in the area of medical malpractice has been declared unconstitutional. Heller v. Frankston, 504 Pa. 528, 475 A.2d 1291 (1984); Mattos v. Thompson, 491 Pa. 385, 421 A.2d 190 (1980). The statutory section in question, entitled \u201cReduction of award by other benefits,\u201d is no longer viable. Heller v. Frankston, supra; Mattos v. Thompson, supra.\nAccordingly, the Order of the Superior Court is hereby affirmed.\nHUTCHINSON, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nPAPADAKOS, J., did not participate in this case."}
