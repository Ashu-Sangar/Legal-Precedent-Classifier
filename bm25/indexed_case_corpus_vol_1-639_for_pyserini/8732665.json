{"id": "8732665", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nAppellant was found guilty of burglary, larceny, receiving stolen goods, possessing burglary tools, and conspiracy. He was sentenced to four to fifteen years imprisonment. The Superior Court affirmed appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence, and we granted allowance of appeal. Appellant claims that a codefendant\u2019s self-incriminating statement which exculpates appellant should have been admitted at trial as a declaration against penal interest.\nAfter reviewing the record, we find this claim to be without merit. Consequently, the judgment of sentence is affirmed."}
