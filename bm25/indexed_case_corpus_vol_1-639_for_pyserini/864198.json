{"id": "864198", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn view of the testimony before the jury there was no error in refusing to affirm either of defendants\u2019 points recited in the first and second specifications respectively. The case appears to have been carefully tried and submitted to the jury with instructions which, with the exception of said points, were satisfactory to both parties. We find nothing in the record that would justify us in sustaining either of the specifications. Judgment affirmed."}
