{"id": "434756", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\n\"Williams, J.\n\u2014 It is clear that the appeal in this case must be dismissed. If the absolute confirmation of the auditor\u2019s report is to be regarded as a decree of distribution, then the appeal, not having been taken within the twenty days allowed by the act, was too late: Dawson\u2019s Appeal, 3 Harris 480. But if it cannot be so regarded, then the appeal was premature. The whole proceedings were manifestly erroneous and void for want of jurisdiction. The money was not in court when the auditor was appointed to make distribution, and, so far as appears, is still in the hands of the sheriff. The fund not being pdthin its grasp, the court had no power, even with the agreement of the parties interested, to decree its distribution: Williams\u2019s Appeal, 9 Barr 267; Masser v. Dewart, 10 Wright 534; Atkins\u2019s Appeal, 8 P. F. Smith 86. Nor was the defect cured by the Act of 28th June 1871, relating to the distribution of moneys r.aised by sheriff\u2019s sales, P. L. 1376, which was not intended to be retroactive.\nAppeal quashed. \u25a0"}
