{"id": "903470", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe find no error in the learned trial judge\u2019s rulings on questions of evidence, or in his finding of facts. In this, as well as in refusing to find as requested by the plaintiff, he is fully sustained by the evidence. There is nothing in either of the specifications that requires discussion. Plaintiff\u2019s request, \u201c to find as matter of law that, under all the evidence,\u201d she \u201c is entitled to a decree restraining the defendant from further prosecution of his business as a distiller and brewer of malt liquors upon the premises described in the bill,\u201d was rightly refused, because it was unwarranted by the facts properly found. In view of these facts there was no error in dismissing the bill.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
