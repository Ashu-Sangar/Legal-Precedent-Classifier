{"id": "1075700", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nAppellant claimed $30,000 from the estate of his deceased father, basing the demand on a check to claimant\u2019s order, signed by decedent, almost four years prior to his death; counsel for appellant contended that a partnership had been proved between the father and son and that the check represented an indebtedness arrived at in the settlement of this partnership. The court below found, however, that \u201cthere was no partnership between decedent and claimant,\u201d and that \u201cdecedent was not indebted to his son.\u201d The majority of this court feels there is evidence on the record to sustain these controlling findings, and, hence, that the decree appealed from must stand.\nThe decree is affirmed; costs to be paid out of the fund for distribution."}
