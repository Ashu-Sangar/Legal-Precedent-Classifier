{"id": "4233921", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 25th day of March, 2013, the Order of the PCRA court dismissing appellant\u2019s third PCRA petition is AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part. The Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County is affirmed to the extent it concludes that recusal of the Honorable Scott D. Keller of the Court of Common Pleas is unwarranted. See Memorandum Opinion, CP-06-CR-118-97, dated 2/29/12. The Order is reversed to the extent it determines that appellant Roderick Johnson\u2019s Brady claim, arising from discovery materials produced during the federal habeas corpus proceedings in the unrelated case of Johnson v. Folino, No. 2:04-cv-02835 (U.S. District Court, E.D.Pa.), is untimely under the Post-Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546.\nThis Court concludes that appellant has demonstrated that the information discovered during the federal habeas proceedings constitutes \u201cnewly discovered\u201d facts for purposes of the (b)(l)(ii) exception to the jurisdictional time bar. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h). The PCRA court\u2019s alternative merits holding on the Brady claim was conclusory and conflated the timeliness assessment and the merits. Accordingly, on remand, the PCRA court is directed to conduct an appropriate merits review of appellant\u2019s Brady claim. Furthermore, in assessing Brady materiality, the court is reminded of the requirement to consider the \u201ccumulative\u201d or \u201ccollective\u201d effect of all of the relevant undisclosed evidence. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995); see also Cone v. Bell, 556 U.S. 449, 129 S.Ct. 1769, 1782-86, 173 L.Ed.2d 701 (2009) (discussing Kyles and considering whether cumulative or collective effect of undisclosed evidence was material).\nFurthermore, appellant\u2019s Application for Leave to File Post-Submission Communication is GRANTED.\nMadame Justice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963)."}
