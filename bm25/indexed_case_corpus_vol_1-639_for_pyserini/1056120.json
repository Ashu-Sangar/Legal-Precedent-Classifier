After making a number of bequests she blended her whole estate in the residuary clause and gave it to the appellant, the Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania of Free and Accepted Ancient York Masons. Her lands thus became bound by necessary implication for tbe payment of the legacies, for wbat the \u201crest and residue\u201d of the estate will be, cannot be ascertained until the debts, legacies and expenses of administration are paid: Cook et al. v. Petty et al., 108 Pa. 138; Sloan\u2019s App., 168 Pa. 422. The decree below but gives effect to the intention of the testatrix, and is affirmed, at the costs of the appellant."}
