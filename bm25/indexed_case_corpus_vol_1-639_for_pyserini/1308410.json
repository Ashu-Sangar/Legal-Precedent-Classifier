{"id": "1308410", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nThe appellants, John Jaindl and Fred J. Jaindl, are owners of 42 acres of farm land in an essentially rural area of Upper Macungie Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania. Planning the operation of a turkey farm thereon, they sought a zoning permit for the construction of certain buildings necessary to the operation. The zoning officer of the township granted the permit. An abutting landowner, Brooke Y. Fidler, appealed the grant of the permit to the township board of adjustment. The board dismissed the appeal. Fidler then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County. . No additional testimony. .was taken. The court, upon the record presented, concluded that the board, committed an error of law and an abuse of discretion, reversed, and revoked the permit. The landowners, John and Fred J. Jaindl, appeal.\nSince the issue was decided by the court below solely upon the record before the board, the scope of our review is limited to whether or not the evidence supports the board\u2019s factual findings and whether or not the board abused its discretion or committed an error of law in making its decision: Tidewater Oil Co. v. Poore, 395 Pa. 89, 149 A. 2d 636 (1959); Magrann v. Zoning Bd. of Adj., 404 Pa. 198, 170 A. 2d 553 (1961).\nThe township zoning ordinance, effective January 1, 1959, divided the municipality into four classifications or districts, namely, \u201cResidential,\u201d \u201cAgricultural,\u201d \u201cCommercial,\u201d and \u201cIndustrial.\u201d The land involved is located in that area zoned \u201cAgricultural.\u201d\nThe section of the zoning ordinance pertinent to an \u201cagricultural\u201d district provides as follows: \u201cSection 501. use regulations. A building may be erected or used, and land may be used or occupied for any of the following purposes, and no other: 1. Any use permitted in R1-Residential District (Class 1). 2. Agriculture, and all business incidental to the processing and marketing of farm products, except as excluded in Section' 502 hereof.\n\u201cSection 502. use exceptions. The erection or use of land and buildings for the following purposes is hereby prohibited: 1. The use of garbage as feed. 2. Commercial slaughterhouses, canneries, grain elevators, warehouses, markets, auctions, bazaars, stockyards, cold storage houses, deep freeze plants, gristmills, feed and grain mills, fertilizer plants, tallow mills and all other pursuits of a commercial nature; provided however, that the Board of Adjustment may grant a special exception and allow any of the above mentioned prohibited uses if the land and buildings are owned by and are to be operated by an agricultural cooperative association, grange or other organization of farmers, the majority of whom reside in Upper Macungie Township, subject to such rules and regulations as the Board of Adjustment may deem necessary in order to comply with the spirit of this ordinance.\u201d\nThe board concluded that the contemplated use of the land was agricultural and, hence, a proper use under the terms of the ordinance. The prime question for our decision is the correctness of this ruling. The contestant-appellee contends that the business intended is a large-scale commercial venture, is not agricultural, and is specifically prohibited under Section 502(2) of the ordinance which proscribes against \u201call other pursuits of a commercial nature.\u201d\nThe facts are as follows: The appellants purchase from a source in California between 150,000 and 400,000 turkey eggs annually. The eggs are hatched at Wennersville, Pennsylvania. The poults are presently raised and housed on appellants\u2019 properties at Huckleberry Hill and Siegersville, Pennsylvania. It is intended to establish a similar raising and housing plant on the land involved.\nBetween 40,000 and 50,000 poults will be transported from the hatching site and housed in fifteen \u201cpole barns,\u201d elevated above the ground, to be constructed on a portion of the land in question. They will be so housed and fed until six or seven months old, when they will be trucked to another site beyond the township limits for the purpose of butchering and processing for market. A portion of the land will be cultivated for the purpose of growing grain to be used as feed, but the yield will be sufficient to feed no more than 3000 or 4000 turkeys a year. The remaining feed necessary will be purchased and transported from outside sources. The \u201cpole barns\u201d will accumulate annually 900 tons of manure.\nThe use contemplated is definitely \u201ccommercial.\u201d Whether or not it is \u201cagricultural,\u201d as well, is the perplexing problem.\nSince the township ordinance failed to define \u201cagriculture\u201d or \u201cagricultural,\u201d the term must be interpreted and applied in accordance with its usual and generally accepted meaning: Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P.L. 1019, \u00a733, 46 P.S. \u00a7533; Commonwealth v. Bay State Milling Co., 312 Pa. 28, 167 A. 307 (1933); and, Commonwealth Tr. Co. Mtg. Invest. Fund Case, 357 Pa. 349, 54 A. 2d 649 (1947). The word \u201cagriculture\u201d is a derivative of two Latin words, \u201cagri\u201d meaning field, and \u201ccultra\u201d meaning cultivation. In its narrowest sense, it concerns the tilling and cultivating of the soil. See, Commonwealth v. Carmalt, 2 Binney 235 (1810). However, it has from an early date reasonably and logically assumed a much broader meaning.\nWebster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed. 1961) defines \u201cagriculture\u201d as: \u201cThe art or science of cultivating the ground, and raising and harvesting-crops, often including also feeding, breeding, and management of livestock; tillage; husbandry; farming; in a broader sense, the science and art of the production of plants and animals useful to man, including to a variable extent the preparation of these products for man\u2019s use and their disposal by marketing or otherwise. In this broad use it includes farming, horticulture, forestry, dairying, sugar making, etc.\u201d\nThe Oxford Universal Dictionary (3d ed. 1955) defines \u201cagriculture\u201d as: \u201cThe science and art of cultivating the soil; including the gathering in of the crops and the rearing of livestock; farming (in the widest sense).\u201d\n3 C. J. S. Agriculture \u00a71, page 365, states: \u201cIn a limited sense, \u2018agriculture\u2019 is the cultivation of grain and other field crops for man and beast; but, in a broader sense, the word signifies the science or art of producing plants and rearing animals useful to man, including certain matters incidental thereto.\u201d Also on the same page \u201cagriculture\u201d is: \u201cthe art or science of cultivating the ground, including harvesting of crops and rearing and management of livestock.\u201d on page 368, it states: \u201cThe distinction between arable agriculture, which includes the cultivation of the ground and the growth of crops, and pastoral agriculture, which comprises merely the feeding and management of the flocks and herds of the farm, has been observed since the earliest times: \u2018Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.\u2019 \u201d See also, Hardy v. Gapen, 141 Pa. Superior Ct. 101, 14 A. 2d 892 (1940).\nIt is fundamental that restrictions imposed by zoning ordinances are in derogation of the common law and must be strictly construed: Rolling Green Golf Case, 374 Pa. 450, 97 A. 2d 523 (1953); Lord Appeal, 368 Pa. 121, 81 A. 2d 533 (1951) ; and, Medinger Appeal, 377 Pa. 217, 104 A. 2d 118 (1954). Such restrictions must not be so construed as to fetter the use of the land by implication. The permissive widest use of the land is the rule and not the exception, unless specifically restrained in a valid and reasonable exercise of the police power.\nViewing the ordinance in this light, it is our conclusion that the use proposed of the land in question is proper and permitted under Section 501 (2) thereof. Clearly, the word \u201cagriculture\u201d therein does not mean only the tilling of the soil. The raising and housing of turkeys is well within the reasonable meaning of the term. It is significant that the term \u201cagriculture\u201d was used and not \u201cfarming,\u201d which might well impose a far different connotation. This was, undoubtedly, done with deliberate purpose. Also, the words \u201cbusiness incidental to the processing and marketing of farm products\u201d are influential. No restrictions were attached and the meaning intended, therefore, must be all inclusive and comprehensive.\nNor are we convinced that because this agricultural venture includes a large-scale commercial activity that it is precluded under Section 502(2). This section restricts itself to the conduct of certain specified commercial pursuits except under defined conditions. It was not intended to entail an agricultural business. Further, the number of turkeys to be raised and housed on the property is no more controlling than the number of cattle on a dairy farm would be if such an application were involved. Likewise, the fact that only a relatively small quantity of the necessary feed will be cultivated on the property is not conclusive. If this concept were correct, an ordinary dairy farm would be precluded if it purchased the necessary needs of the stock from outside sources.\nFinally, the argument asserted that the general provision of the ordinance as to \u201cProhibited Uses\u201d (Section 806) forbids the agricultural enterprise involved is not persuasive. This provides: \u201cNo lot or parcel of land shall be used for the following purposes: . . . (d) Any trade, industry or business that is noxious or offensive by.reason of odor, dust, gas smoke, vibration, illumination, or noise, or that constitutes a public hazard whether by fire, explosion or otherwise.\u201d\nThis prohibition has no application to agricultural districts and was not so intended. Such a construction would completely nullify and destroy the entire agricultural provision of the ordinance. Every farm gives off odors of manure, cattle, chickens, turkeys, fertilizers etc., all of which are offensive to the uninitiated nostril. Such aroma is \u201cthe usual\u201d in agricultural areas.\nAn ordinance, like a statute, must be \u25a0 construed, if possible to give effect to all of its provisions: Statutory Construction Act, supra, Sections 51 & 52 (2); and, Commonwealth, v. McHugh, 406 Pa. 566, 178 A. 2d 556 (1962).\nGuided by these considerations, the inevitable conclusion is that when the township prohibited therein any trade or business that is offensive by reason of odor, noise, etc., it did not intend these words to include such odors and noises that are inseparable from ordinary farming or agricultural activity.\nWe find no abuse of discretion or error of law- in the decision of the board of adjustment.\nThe order of the court below is reversed.\nEmphasis supplied."}
