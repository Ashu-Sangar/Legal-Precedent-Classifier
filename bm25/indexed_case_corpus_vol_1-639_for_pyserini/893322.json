{"id": "893322", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe quite agree with what was said by'the learned president of the orphans\u2019 court in overruling appellant\u2019s exceptions and confirming the auditor\u2019s report. We find nothing in the record that would justify a reversal or modification of the decree; nor is there anything in either of the questions presented by the specifications of error that requires discussion. For reasons given in the opinion of the court below the decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
