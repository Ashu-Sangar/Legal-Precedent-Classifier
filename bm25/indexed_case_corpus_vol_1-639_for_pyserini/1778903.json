{"id": "1778903", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nThe Commonwealth filed a petition for allowance of appeal from an Order of the Superior Court which reversed Arthur J. Metzler\u2019s conviction of aggravated assault. Metzler was convicted of aggravated assault and sentenced to no less than fifteen months nor more than four years imprisonment. The Superior Court reversed, ruling that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of sanity was so inadequate, as a matter of law, the fact finder could not be satisfied of defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Metzler, 300 Pa.Super. 19, 445 A.2d 1277 (1982).\nAn examination of the record convinces us that there was sufficient evidence of sanity to allow the trial judge to determine that Metzler failed to meet either part of the M\u2019Naghten test. In order to escape criminal responsibility, defendants must show they are laboring under such a defect of reason, at the time of the act, that they are either incapable of knowing what they were doing or were incapable of judging that it was wrong. Commonwealth v. Demmitt, 456 Pa. 475, 321 A.2d 627 (1974). Evidence was presented to show that Metzler initially flirted with the victim and was rebuffed. After he assaulted the victim, he immediately left the premises. Upon being apprehended less than one hour after the assault, he admitted striking the victim. At trial, Metzler testified that he knew what he was doing and that it was bad.\nTherefore, in reviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, Commonwealth v. Blevins, 453 Pa. 481, 309 A.2d 421 (1973), it was error for the Superior Court to reverse Metzler\u2019s conviction for aggravated assault. Accordingly, we hereby grant the Commonwealth\u2019s petition, reverse the Order of the Superior Court, and reinstate the conviction and sentence of Metzler as entered by the trial judge.\nROBERTS, J., files a dissenting statement."}
