{"id": "1031248", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nSharswood, J.\nThe lease by the plaintiff in error to Harding was in this instance a contract by him to erect the building. He wras to be paid, not in money, but in the term for years of the premises; the increased rent would be his until the termination of the lease, when it would enure to the benefit of the life-tenant and owners in fee. It is clear that Mrs. Fisher was \u201c the person in possession at the time of commencing the said building and at whose instance it was erected,\u201d and so within the letter as well as spirit and intention of the Act of April 28th 1840, sect. 24, Pamph. L. 474. The case is not distinguished from Woodward v. Leiby, 12 Casey 437; Leiby v. Wilson, 4 Wright 63; Hopper v. Childs, 7 Id. 310.\nIt is equally clear that the provisions of the Act of August 1st 1868, Pamph. L. 1168, do not apply. That act is specially confined to debts contracted \u201c in or about the repair, alteration or addition to any house.\u201d The claim filed in accordance with the fact is for a debt contracted, \u201c for and toward the erection and construction \u201d of the building. Although the words \u201c alteration and repairing of and improvement\u201d are added, they are evidently mere surplusage and cannot change the character of the lien.\nJudgment affirmed."}
