{"id": "1787711", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court, 73 Pa.Cmwlth. 59, 457 A.2d 213, granting summary judgment to the State Ethics Commission in a class action brought by incumbent school directors seeking declaratory and injunctive relief from the enforcement of Sections 4, 5 and 9 of the Public Officials Ethics Act (Ethics Act) on the grounds that these sections of the act are unconstitutional. These sections of the act provide, in essence, that a public official must, as a condition for taking the oath of office or continuing to perform his duties, and as a condition to receive payment for his services, file a statement of financial interests, \u00a7 404(d), which statement shall include the following information with respect to the public official and members of his \u201cimmediate family,\u201d i.e., \u201c[a] spouse residing in the person\u2019s household and minor dependent children,\u201d \u00a7 402:\n(1) The name, address and position of the person required to file the statement.\n(2) The occupations or professions of the person required to file the statement and those of his immediate family.\n(3) Any direct or indirect interest in any real estate which was sold or leased to the Commonwealth, any of its agencies or political subdivisions; purchased or leased from the Commonwealth, any of its agencies or political subdivisions; or which was the subject of any condemnation proceedings by the Commonwealth, any of its agencies or political subdivisions.\n(4) The name and address of each creditor to whom is owed in excess of $5,000 and the interest rate thereon. However, loans or credit extended between members of the immediate family and mortgages securing real property which is the principal residence of the person filing or of his spouse shall not be included.\n(5) The name and address of any person who is the direct or indirect source of income totalling in the aggregate $500 or more. However, this provision shall not be construed to require the divulgence of confidential information protected by statute or existing professional codes of ethics.\n(6) The name and address of any person from whom a gift or gifts valued in the aggregate at $200 or more were received, and the value and the circumstances of each gift. However, this provision shall not be applicable to gifts received from the individual\u2019s spouse, parents, parents by marriage, siblings, children or grandchildren.\n(7) The source of any honorarium received which is in excess of $100.\n(8) Any office, directorship or employment of any nature whatsoever in any business entity.\n(9) Any financial interest in any legal entity engaged in business for profit.\n(c) The statement of financial interest need not include specific amounts for any of the items required to be listed.\n65 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 405(b), (c). The penalty section of the act provides, in pertinent part:\n(b) Any person who violates the provisions of ... section 4 [section 404 of Title 65] is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or be both fined and imprisoned.\n65 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 409(b). This appeal followed Commonwealth Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Ethics Commission.\nAppellant school directors allege that these provisions of the Ethics Act are unconstitutional as to the directors in that the statutory provision for criminal prosecution in the event of non-disclosure of the financial affairs of members of his immediate family denies due process to the school director because, in the case of these directors, the act would impose criminal liability based on an inability to comply with the act\u2019s requirements, not an unwillingness to comply. Further, appellants urge that the reporting requirements of the act are unconstitutional as to the immediate families in that the requirements of the act invade the family members\u2019 right of privacy. We agree that both due process and privacy violations render the family reporting provisions of the act unconstitutional.\nI.\nThe penalty section of the act, \u00a7 409, supra, by its terms, provides that a public official who does not file the information required by \u00a7 404 \u201cis guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined ... or imprisoned ... or ... both.\u201d No mention is made of a requirement of criminal intent or criminal culpability. To the contrary, criminal liability may be imposed by the mere non-compliance with the reporting requirements of the act. The public official, therefore, on the one hand, is required to file financial information concerning himself and his immediate family, and failure to do this may result in criminal liability; but on the other hand, the official may have no means to acquire and file the information he is required to produce. As we have had occasion to observe before, a married couple is not a single entity, but separate individuals, each of whom controls or has the right to control his own life, associations, finances, and affairs generally:\nAny presumption of identity of interest [between husband and wife] is based upon the same outmoded social conditions and policy as was the common law legal fiction of unity of person of husband and wife.\nH< * >}\u00a1 * He #\nModern conditions demand that courts no longer engage in automatic and unsupported assumption that one\u2019s pecuniary or proprietary interest is identical to that of one\u2019s spouse.\nEstate of Grossman, 486 Pa. 460, 472-73, 406 A.2d 726 (1979). See also Snider v. Thornburgh, 496 Pa. 159, 180 (Opinion of Mr. Justice Flaherty), 186 (Opinion in Support of Reversal, Mr. Chief Justice Roberts), 436 A.2d 593 (1981). Thus, under the terms of the Ethics Act, criminal liability may result from non-compliance with reporting requirements with which a public official may have no ability to comply. Imposition of such criminal liability offends due process, for it is axiomatic that criminal liability may not be imposed for the failure to perform acts which a person has no power to perform. Rather, the essence of our criminal law is the imposition of criminal liability for voluntary, culpable acts, see 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 301, 302, which are offensive to public order and decency. Thus, the reporting requirements of the Ethics Act do not withstand a due process challenge.\nII.\nEqually troublesome, however, is the act\u2019s infringement on the privacy rights of the public official\u2019s family. This Court has recognized the existence of a constitutionally guaranteed right of privacy based on Article 1, \u00a7 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides:\nAll men are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, of acquiring, possessing and protecting property and reputation, and of pursuing their own happiness.\nFollowing the suggestion of the United States Supreme Court in Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 97 S.Ct. 869, 51 L.Ed.2d 64 (1977), we have adopted a two pronged analysis of privacy as involving (1) a freedom from disclosure of personal matters and (2) the freedom to make certain important decisions. In Re June 1979 Allegheny County Investigating Grand Jury, 490 Pa. 143, 150-51, 415 A.2d 73, 77 (1980). The interest in avoiding a disclosure of personal matters, this Court has said, \u201cfinds explicit protection in the Pennsylvania Constitution, Art. 1, \u00a7 1____\u201d Id. Thus, there is a recognized privacy interest sought to be protected in this case; it is in the nature of freedom from disclosure of personal matters; and it is constitutionally based.\nWhile it is true that the disclosures required by the act do not require the listing of particular sums of money, business associations are, nevertheless, required to be listed and particular individuals and business entities named. As to an office holder himself, such reporting requirements are a permissible intrusion into one\u2019s privacy, Snider v. Thornburgh, 496 Pa. 159, 436 A.2d 593 (1981), but such an intrusion into privacy must be viewed quite differently when it affects private persons who, unlike the public official, do not hold themselves out as public figures or as seekers for public office.\nIt is not the case, of course, that every intrusion into an individual\u2019s privacy is impermissible. As just mentioned, this Court has approved the very intrusions at issue in this case as applied to the office holder himself, Id. We have also held that an investigating grand jury may subpoena hospital medical records containing reports of patients\u2019 tissue specimens, In Re June 1979 Allegheny County Investigating Grand Jury, supra; that a commission of the General Assembly may compel a person to reveal his personal affairs to the extent that such disclosure is reasonably required for the general purpose of the inquiry, Annenberg v. Roberts, 333 Pa. 203, 2 A.2d 612 (1938). On the other hand, we have held that the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under Art. I, \u00a7 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution \u201cis tied to the implicit right to privacy in this Commonwealth,\u201d which protects a customer\u2019s \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy in records pertaining to their affairs kept at the bank,\u201d Commonwealth v. De-John, 486 Pa. 32, 49, 403 A.2d 1283, 1291 (1979). In all these cases there is implicit a balancing of an individual\u2019s right to privacy against a counterveiling state interest which may or may not justify, in the circumstances, an intrusion on privacy.\nThis balancing process must be carried out with recognition of the nature of the privacy right and its important relationship to other basic rights. Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is has ably described the right of privacy and its relation to our sustained viability as free and healthy individuals as follows:\nThe makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness. They recognized the significance of man\u2019s spiritual nature, of his feelings and of his intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure and satisfactions of life are to be found in material things. They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against the government, the right to be let alone \u2014 the most comprehensive of rights and the right most valued by civilized men.\nOlmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478, 48 S.Ct. 564, 572, 72 L.Ed. 944, 956 (1928) (Dissenting Opinion of Mr. Justice Brand\u00e9is) (Emphasis supplied). Thus, it may be said that government\u2019s intrusion into a person\u2019s private affairs is constitutionally justified when the government interest is significant and there is no alternate reasonable method of lesser intrusiveness to accomplish the governmental purpose. Whether there is a significant state interest will depend, in part, on whether the state\u2019s intrusion will effect its purpose; for if the intrusion does not effect the state\u2019s purpose, it is a gratuitous intrusion, not a purposeful one. Here, while the family reporting requirement does great damage to privacy interests, it does not realistically hold out much hope for effectiveness: a public official determined to evade the financial reporting requirements of the act will merely transfer various property interests to individuals or business entities outside of his immediate family. Thus, although certain financial disclosures of an office holder\u2019s family may be of public interest, it cannot fairly be said that such disclosures represent a significant state interest. Moreover, when one considers the likely impact of the Ethics Act upon the associational rights of the family members under the United States Constitution and the Pennsylvania Constitution, the infirmities of the act for overbreadth become apparent:\nA law is void on its face if it \u201cdoes not aim specifically at evils within the allowable area of [government] control, but ... sweeps within its ambit other activities that constitute an exercise\u201d of protected expressive or associational rights.\nTribe, American Constitutional Law, \u00a7 12-24, p. 710 (1978), quoting Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U.S. 88, 97, 60 S.Ct. 736, 741, 84 L.Ed. 1093, 1100 (1939). While it may be true that some public officials would be apprehended after they had breached the public trust or dissuaded from improper activity by the family reporting requirement of the Ethics Act, it is certainly true that all of a public official\u2019s family members will suffer a chilling effect on their freedom to associate with persons or business entities of their own choice, knowing that these associations will be subject to public scrutiny and appraisal.\nFor these reasons, we hold that the reporting provisions of the Ethics Act relating to family members are unconstitutional in that they violate the due process rights of the public official and the family\u2019s right to privacy under Art. 1 \u00a7 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\nReversed.\nROBERTS, C.J., joins Part I of this opinion.\nHUTCHINSON, J., files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nNIX, J., files a dissenting opinion in which LARSEN, J., joins.\n.

Thornburgh:\nWhere disqualification from office and criminal liability result not from unwillingness, but from inability to comply with the [Ethics] act\u2019s requirements, the imposition of these sanctions is fundamentally unfair and clearly violates the due process requirements of the Constitutions of the United States and Pennsylvania.\n496 Pa. 159, 186, 436 A.2d 593, 606 (1981) (Opinion in Support of Reversal).\n.

The Allegheny County Grand Jury case was a plurality opinion, but Mr. Justice Larsen and this writer, albeit in dissenting opinions, joined the majority in recognizing a constitutionally based right of privacy.\n. The nature of the governmental purpose in this case is well expressed at the beginning of the act:\nThe Legislature hereby declares that public office is a public trust and that any effort to realize personal financial gain through public office other than compensation provided by law is a violation of that trust. In order to strengthen the faith and confidence of the people of the State in their government, the Legislature further declares that the people have a right to be assured that the financial interests of holders of or candidates for public office present neither a conflict nor the appearance of a conflict with the public trust. Because public confidence in government can best be sustained by assuring the people of the impartiality and honesty of public officials, this act shall be liberally construed to promote complete disclosure.\n65 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 401.\n.
