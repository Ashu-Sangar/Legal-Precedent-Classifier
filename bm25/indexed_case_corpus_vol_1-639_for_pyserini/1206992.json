{"id": "1206992", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from a judgment and sentence upon a conviction for involuntary manslaughter. .\nOn January 10, 1939, at 6:40 p. m., appellant was operating a Ford automobile in a. southerly direction on Ridge Avenue at or near'the intersection of that avenue with Rector Street, which enters Ridge Avenue from the east but which does not continue westward Of Ridge Avenue. ' His automobile struck a young woman named'Philomeh\u00e1 Wilson while she was crossing Ridge Avenue,' killing her instantly. The Commonwealth produced testimony that the defendant\u2019s car was being driven at about 60 miles ah'hour. Defendant was placed on trial on April 26, 1939, \u2019and oh the following day was found guilty of the charge of involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to undergo imprisonment in the Philadelphia County Prison for a term of T8 months and to pay a fine \u00f3f $25.00. Upon appealing to the Superior Court a new trial was granted (see 138 Pa. Superior Ct. 180,10 A. 2d 22). Defendant was \u00e1gain placed on trial on June 26, 1940, and was found guilty of involuntary 'manslaughter. The Verdict contained a recommendation Of mercy; Defendant was then sentenced to undergo imprisonment in the Philadelphia County Prison for \u00e1 term of one year. Upon appeal to the Superior Court, the judgment was affirmed. An appeal was thereupon allowed to this court.\nThe first assignment of error is as follows: \u201cThe Superior Court erred in overruling appellant\u2019s fourth assignment of error. 'This assignment was as follows: \u2018The court below erred when in defining the crime of involuntary manslaughter the jury were instructed that it is committed by a lawful act which merely approximates unlawfulness) as follows: \u201cThis defendant is charged with involuntary manslaughter, and The definition of involuntary manslaughter, members of the jury, is where it plainly appears that neither death nor great bodily harm was intended, but \u2022 that the death was caused accidentally by some unlawful act not amounting to a felony, or by the commission \u00f3f a lawful act, not merely carelessness, but so rash and reckless as to approximate unlawfulness.\u201d \u2019 \u201d j\n...On .this phase of the ease the Superior Court said: \u201cAs. to the second- question, appellant recognizes, that his complaint of the \u25a0 use of. the word \u2018approximate\u2019 in the charge of the. court was fully argued on the first appeal to this court,. and appellant\u2019s contention dismissed. The trial court followed Commonwealth v. Gill, 120 Pa. Superior, Cf. 22, 182 A. 103, and Commonwealth v. Matteo 130 Pa. Superior Ct. 524, 197 A. 787. Careless, negligent, and reckless conduct is. not . necessarily an unlawful act, that is, an act forbidden-by law, but it may under- certain circumstances approximate unlawfulness so that , in the mind of -the law. it amounts to an unlawful act. However,, death Caused by, or resulting as a consequence of, recklessly driving a motor vehicle is involuntary manslaughter;\u201d\nThe basis of the present appeal-is the .use of. the word \u201capproximate\u201d in the excerpt-quoted from the instructions. The verb \u201capproximate\u201d, literally means-to \u201ccome near\u201d. Webster\u2019s. New International Dictionary, 2d ed., defines it as follows: \u201cto advance near\u201d. -The instruction complained of amounted to this: If the death of the victim named in the. indictment was-caused by the defendant\u2019s commission of an, act so rash and reckless as to come near to being unlawful, he could be convicted of involuntary manslaughter. \u2022 This was error. It: fell short .of what the Commonwealth charged-in the indictment and it lowered the standard of proof legally required, of the. Commonwealth, in order to warrant a conviction of the charge.made. .\\When recklessness of conduct causes another\u2019s death, it must in order to-sustain a charge, of involuntary, manslaughter amount to unlawfulness of conduct., \u201cAn unlawful act such as constitutes an element of involuntary, manslaughter is a thing which one has no right to do\u201d; quoted in Warren on Homicide, Vol. 1, sec. 86, p. 420, from State v. Woods (Del.) 77 Atl. 490. No person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter unless he kills another by acting unlawfully. It is immaterial whether the unlawful act . which is an essential of involuntary, manslaughter was unlawful in its inception as, e. g., discharging a deadly weapon into a crowded street,, or became unlawful after it was begun, as, e. g., driving a car in a public street and so accelerating its speed as to make it naturally tend to ca\u00fase death or great bodily harm to persons in that street.. The first example is of \u00e1n inherently unlawful act; the second is of an act (driving a car) not unlawful in itself but done without due caution, i. e., in an unlawful manner. In Com. v. Godshalk, 76 Pa. Superior Ct. 500, that court, in an opinion by President Judge Orlady, said at page 503: \u201cReckless driving upon the highway is not the exercise of reasonable or ordinary care in. the use of it, and is a failure to perform a duty imposed by law.\u201d\nThe Act of March 31,1860, P. L. 382, sec. 79, amended by the Act of April 11, 1929, P: L. 513, sec. 1, 18 PS sec. 2226, provides : \u201cIf any person shall be charged with involuntary manslaughter, happening in consequence of an unlawful act, it shall and may'be lawful for the district attorney, with the leave of the court, to waive the felony and to proceed against and charge such person\u2019 with a misdemeanor,\u201d etc. In other words, the very essence of the crime of involuntary manslaughter is the death of a human being \u201cin- consequence of am unlawful aot\u201d. The Act of April 28, 1871, P: L. 244; sec. 1, 19 PS sec. 352, provides: \u2018In any indictment for involuntary manslaughter it shall not be necessary to set forth the manner in which or the means by which the death of the deceased was caused, but it shall be sufficient in every indictment for \u25a0 involuntary manslaughter to charge that the defendant did unlawfully. kill and slay the deceased.\u201d\nIf the contention of the Commonwealth is corr\u00e9ct, it would be sufficient in any indictment for involuntary manslaughter to charge that the defendant did \u201calmost unlawfully kill and slay the deceased.\u201d The Commonwealth\u2019s contention is- not correct, for he whose acts merely approximate unlawfulness is doing nothing criminal and for such acts he is not subject to indictment. To make out a case of involuntary manslaughter, it must be proved that the death of a human being was caused by another\u2019s unlawful act. It is immaterial whether the unlawfulness of the act is inherent in its very nature and, purpose or arises only from the manner of performing an act which in its inception and aims is not unlawful.\nThe law nowhere countenances careless, negligent \u00e1nd reckless conduct when that conduct menaces the physical well-being of others. Such conduct is therefore unlawful. It may not be unlawful if it menaces only the well-being of the reckless individual himself. It becomes so when others are brought within its compass. In Bisson v. Kelly, 314 Pa. 99, 110, 170 A. 139, this court said: \u201cIt is a primary social duty of every person to take thought and have a care lest his action result in injuries to others. This social duty the law recognizes and enforces, and for any injury resulting from any. person\u2019s lack of elementary forethought, the law holds that person accountable. A normal human being is held to foresee those injuries which are the consequence of his acts of omission or commission which he, as a reasonable human being, should have foreseen.\u201d\nWhat we have said herein is in harmony with what has long been the accepted law as to involuntary manslaughter. Blackstone in his Commentaries, Lewis Ed., Book 4, star page 192, says: \u201cThe second branch, or involuntary manslaughter, differs also from homicide excusable by misadventure in this, \u2014 that misadventure always happens in consequence of a lawful act, but this species of manslaughter in consequence of an unlawful one. . . . So, where a person does an act lawful in itself, but in an unlawful manner, and without due caution and circumspection, as. when a workman flings down a stone or piece of timber into'the street and kills a man, this may be either misadventure, manslaughter, or murder, according to the circumstances urn der which the original act was done. If it were a' country village where few passengers are, and he calls out to all people to have a care, it is misadventure only; but if it were in London, or other populous town, where people are continually passing, it is. manslaughter, though he gives loud warning, and murder if he knows of their passing and gives no warning at all, for then it is malice against all mankind.\u201d\nIn Com. v. Gable, 7 S. & R. 422, at 427, this court, in an opinion by Chief..Justice Tilghman, said: \u201cInvoluntary manslaughter is, where it plainly appears that neither death nor any great bodily harm was intended, but death is accidentally .caused by some unlawful act, or an act not. strictly unlawful in itself j but done in an unlawful manner and without due caution.\u201d In Com. v. Micuso., 273 Pa. 474, 477, 117 A. 211, this court said: \u201cDeath caused by recklessly driving a motor vehicle, or. by carelessly discharging a firearm in a populous place, are examples of involuntary manslaughter.\u201d\nIn Com. v. Mayberry, 290, Pa. 195, 138 A. 686, this, court, speaking through the present Chief Justice, said-: \u201cInvoluntary manslaughter consists in \u2018the killing of another without malice and unintentionally, but in doing some unlawful act not amounting, to a felony, nor naturally tending to cause death or great bodily harm, or. in negligently doing some act . lawful in itself, or by the negligent omission .to perform a legal duty\u2019: 29 C. J. [sec. 134] page-1148,\u201d and other citations. The. next and concluding sentence of this section 134 on page 1148 of C. J. states: \u201cThe unlawfulness of the act in connection with which the killing occurs is the element which distinguishes involuntary manslaughter from a killing excusable as by accident or misfortune.\u201d 90 American State Reports, p. 572, lays down this principle: \u201cCriminality may be affirmed of a lawful act carelessly done. . . . The negligence must. be. such a: departure from what would be the conduct of an ordinary prudent or careful man under the same circumstances as to evidence a disregard of human life or an indifference to consequences.\u201d ,\n|while the basis of a charge of involuntary man- ^ slaughter is the causing of another\u2019s death by' one\u2019s negligent act or negligent, omission to act, the proof of negligence that will support that charge must be something more than the slight negligence which will support a civil action for damages based, on negligence] \u00a3 In 26 American Jurisprudence, sec. 210, p. 299, it is well stated: \u201cAside from the facts that a more culpable degree of negligence is required in order to establish a criminal homicide than is required in a civil action' for damages and that contributory negligence is not a defense, criminal responsibility for a negligent homicide is ordinarily to be determined pursuant to .the general principles of negligence, the fundamental of which is knowledge, actual or imputed, that the act of the slayer tended to endanger life. The facts must be such that the fatal consequence, of the negligent act could reasonably have been foreseen. It must appear that the,death was not the result of misadventure, but the natural and probable result of a reckless or culpably negligent act.\u201d\nIn Com. v. Pierce, 138 Mass. 165, 52 American Reports 26\u00e1, Justice Holmes said: \u201cKnowledge of the dangerous character of a thing is only the equivalent of foresight of the way . in which it will act. We admit that, if the thing is generally supposed to be universally harmless, and only a specialist would. foresee; that in a given case it would do damage, a person who did not foresee it, and who had no warning, would not. be held liable for the harm.\u201d Michie on Homicide, Yol. 1, page 178, says:' \u201cWhere, the unlawful act which produces death is unintentionally but'negligently, done, the. defendant is guilty of. involuntary manslaughter. On a trial for involuntary manslaughter in causing death by negligence, the issues ar\u00e9 whether the death of the deceased was reasonably to be considered as a consequence of that negligence.\u201d\nOn the other hand, the proof of negligence to support a charge of. involuntary manslaughter need not be proof of acts or omissions exhibiting reckless, wicked and wanton disregard of the safety of- others. Negligence of that high degree will support a charge of murder in the second degree, as this court recognized in Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, 293 Pa. 218. In Com. v. Mayberry, 290 Pa. 195, this court, in an opinion by the present Chief Justice, said: \u201cHad the appellant at bar dashed down Highland Avenue and. wantonly, recklessly and in disregard of consequences hurled his car against another or into a crowd or over a person on sidewalk or street and death resulted, then, considering the kind of instrumentality that an automobile is, we are not prepared to say that he ought not to face the same- consequences that would be meted out to him if he had accomplished death by wantonly and wickedly firing a gun: People v. Brown, 53 Cal. App. 664, 200 Pac. 727.\u201d\nIn Com. v. Beattie, 93 Pa. Superior Ct. 404, 408, that court said: \u201cIf this defendant wantonly, recklessly and in disregard of consequences drove his car into the Zurn car and death resulted, we are not prepared to say that \u2018a consciousness of peril or probable peril to human life was not to be imputed to defendant,\u2019 (Shorter v. State, 147 Tenn. 355, 247 S. W. 985) which would establish the element of malice which is requisite in murder.\u201d'\nIn 1 East\u2019s Pleas of the Crown, 263, is laid down this rule: \u201cA person driving a carriage happens to kill another: If he saw or had timely notice of the mischief likely to ensue, and yet wilfully drove on, it will be murder ; for the presumption of malice arises from the doing of a dangerous act intentionally. There is the heart regardless of social duty. If he might have seen the danger, but did not look before Mm, it will be manslaughter, for want of due circumspection. But if the accident happened in such a manner that no want of due care could be imputed to the driver, it will be accidental death, and he will be excused.\u201d\n. If the appellant in the instant case ran his car in a manner which was rash and reckless at . the time and place in question, he was guilty of an unlawful act, for he was doing something the law forbids. He could not be convicted if the act which had fatal consequences only approximated unlawfulness. In criminal trials the proof offered by the Commonwealth must, measure up to the charge made in the indictment. Here the charge was that defendant \u201cunlawfully killed\u201d the victim named,'],\nThe first assignment of error is sustained. The judgment is reversed and a new trial ordered."}
