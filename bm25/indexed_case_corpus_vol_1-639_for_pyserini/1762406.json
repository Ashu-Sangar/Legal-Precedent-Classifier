{"id": "1762406", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis direct appeal is from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County holding appellant in contempt of court. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment of sentence.\nThe relevant facts are as follows: Appellant, Thomas E. Harting, Esquire, is and was a public defender in Lancaster County. On Friday, July 16, 1976, in the course of representing a client at a suppression hearing, appellant made three objections to testimony given on direct examination by a police detective. The objections were as to hearsay utterances, and upon appellant\u2019s making his third objection, the following occurred:\nMR. HARTING: I\u2019m objecting to what Mr. Miller said.\nTHE COURT: Objection overruled. Do you understand the difference between hearsay for truth and falsity\u2014\nMR. HARTING: Yes I do. Do you understand it, Your Honor?\nTHE COURT: Yes I do. I\u2019ll speak to you later about this impertinence. Proceed.\nMR. HARTING: Your Honor, I move that you replace yourself as a presiding judge and have another judge in this case.\nTHE COURT: I\u2019ll speak to you later. Overruled.\n(Notes of Suppression Hearing at 13).\nAt the conclusion of the suppression hearing on Friday afternoon, the judge dismissed everyone from the courtroom except for appellant, a clerk and a court reporter. At that time, the following exchange took place:\nTHE COURT: Now Mr. Harting, I did not understand the remark you made to the Court as to whether I knew something about the law, or words to that effect. What was the reason for that remark which I take to be an impertinence?\nMR. HARTING: I took it to be an impertinence when you asked the same question to me, Your Honor. If we are to have any kind of proper discussion on whether or not you or I understand the law, I think we ought to be on equal terms. I think, Your Honor, you\u2019re a judge. You are paid forty thousand dollars a year. You should have the temperament and patience as that of an attorney, and when you ask questions and try to force attorneys and try to embarrass them in front of the court thing in front in open court, I think that you are not doing your judicial function.\nTHE COURT: And you think that question I asked you was a question which was deemed and intended to embarrass you?\nMR. HARTING: It was in the same context as my question.\nTHE COURT: And you think\u2014\nMR. HARTING: They are almost identical.\nTHE COURT: And you think my question to you was intended to embarrass you?\nMR. HARTING: If you thought the question I asked you was intended to be one of impertinence \u2014 yes.\nTHE COURT: And you think that was the intention of the Court \u2014 to embarrass you?\nMR. HARTING: There was no doubt it was taken that way. In other words, you asked me if I understood the law.\nTHE COURT: Is there anything further you wish to say about this?\nMR. HARTING: No, Your Honor.\n(Whereupon the hearing adjourned.)\n(Notes of Suppression Hearing at 34-36).\nOn Monday morning, July 19, 1976, the judge held appellant in contempt of court and ordered him to appear later that afternoon for sentencing. At the sentencing proceeding, appellant appeared, with counsel, before all four judges of the Lancaster County Court and his counsel was given an opportunity to speak on his behalf. Appellant apologized to the court at that time for his previous behavior. Finally, the President Judge administered a severe reprimand to appellant for his disrespectful conduct.\nThe statute upon which our jurisdiction is based states, in relevant part: \u201cThe Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final orders of the Courts of Common Pleas in any of the following classes of cases . (5) direct criminal contempt . . . .\u201d (emphasis added). Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, supra Note 1. Appellee objects that this appeal is premature, arguing that the court below did not enter a judgment of sentence on appellant\u2019s conviction and that a conviction without a sentence is not a final order. Thus, we must determine initially whether the \u201csevere reprimand\u201d which was administered to appellant as the sanction for his contemptuous remarks constitutes a judgment of sentence, i. e., a final appealable order.\nTraditionally, contempt is punishable by fine or imprisonment. See, 17 P.S. \u00a7 2042. The recently enacted Sentencing Code, however, authorizes a variety of sentencing alternatives, depending upon the circumstances of each case. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1321. One of the enumerated alternatives is \u201c[a] determination of guilt without further penalty\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1321(a)(2), which may be imposed by the court \u201c[i]f in light of all the circumstances, probation would be appropriate under \u00a7 1322 . . . ., but it appears that probation is unnecessary . . . .\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1323.\nIt appears that we have before us a sentence of \u201cguilt without penalty.\u201d Although an order of probation may have been appropriate in this case, it is apparent that probation was unnecessary.\nIn some instances, the court may decide that the needs of justice are fulfilled by a determination of guilt alone, without necessity for further penalty. The shame and trauma of public conviction may be punishment enough and there may be no need of any plan for \u2018reformation\u2019 or control. In such cases, the courts should be free to make such a judgment without requiring useless probation.\nS. Toll, Pennsylvania Crimes Code Annotated, \u00a7 1323, (Supp. 1978) (Report of Special Committee of Pennsylvania Bar Association). Thus, the lower court, in meting out a \u201csevere reprimand\u201d, acknowledged appellant\u2019s guilt without imposing any other form of punishment. As such, we have a \u201cdetermination of guilt without further penalty\u201d as authorized by 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1321,1323, which constitutes a final, appealable order.\nHaving determined that this case is properly before us, we now turn to a consideration of the merits. Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his contempt conviction under the Act of June 16, 1836, P.L. 784, \u00a7 23, 17 P.S. \u00a7 2041, reenacted as 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4131, which provides, in pertinent part:\nThe power of the several courts of this Commonwealth to issue attachments and to inflict summary punishments for contempts of court shall be restricted to the following cases, .\nIII. To the misbehavior of any person in the presence of the court, thereby obstructing the administration of justice, [hereinafter \u201csubsection III\u201d]\nWe agree with appellant and accordingly reverse the judgment of sentence.\nThe principles controlling convictions for contempt are well settled:\nIn a prosecution for criminal contempt, the Commonwealth has the burden of proving every element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt ... To prove criminal contempt of court which may be acted upon under authority of subsection III of the Act of June 16, 1836, the Commonwealth must prove an improper intent, an action and an obstruction of the administration of justice.\nIn re Johnson, 467 Pa. 552, 557, 359 A.2d 739, 742 (1976). The threshold issue is whether appell\u00e1nt\u2019s remarks obstructed justice. \u201c[F]or conduct to be an obstruction of the administration of justice, it must interfere with and disrupt the orderly process of a court.\u201d Id., 467 Pa. at 558, 359 A.2d at 742. \u201cMere affront to the trial judge is not enough.\u201d Id., 467 Pa. at 560, 359 A.2d at 743. \u201cAn obstruction of the administration of justice is a significant disruption of judicial proceedings.\u201d Commonwealth v. Garrison, 478 Pa. 356, 372, 386 A.2d 971, 979 (1978). \u201c[T]hat remarks are injudicious ... an affront to the dignity or sensibility of the court ... or even disrespectful or insulting . will not, without more, justify conviction for summary criminal contempt.\u201d Id., 478 Pa. at 373, 386 A.2d at 979. Inappropriate and ill-mannered conduct that \u201cdid not obstruct or delay the hearing . . . falls short of that misbehavior which may be punished under subsection III of the Act of 1836.\u201d In re Cogan, 485 Pa. 273, 282, 401 A.2d 1142, 1146 (1979). Appellant\u2019s conduct, judged by the foregoing standards, did not amount to that which would be punishable as criminal contempt. The remarks made by appellant were of momentary nature and we do not find the progress of the hearing to have been impeded thereby. Appellant\u2019s remarks were, however, clearly impertinent.\nA lawyer has the responsibility of representing his client to the fullest extent possible, within the bounds of the law. Code of Professional Responsibility, Canon 7, EC 7-1. As advocates in an adversary system, lawyers must be afforded significant latitude to vigorously pursue their client\u2019s cause. Such obligation, however, in no way lessens the lawyer\u2019s absolute duty to respect and uphold the dignity of the judicial process, Id., EC 7-36; ABA Standards, The Defense Function, \u00a7 7.1.\nThe \u201claw\u201d is given corporeal existence in the form of the judge. When carrying out the judicial function, the judge becomes a personification of justice itself. When presiding over any aspect of the judicial process, the judge is not merely another person in the courtroom, subject to affront and insult by lawyers. \u201cThe obligation of the lawyer to maintain a respectful attitude toward the court is \u2018not for the sake of the temporary incumbent of the judicial office,\u2019 but to give due recognition to the position held by the judge in the administration of the law.\u201d ABA Standards, The Defense Function, \u00a7 7.1, Commentary at 259. The judge is the court, and a display of insolence and disrespect to him is an insult to the majesty of the law itself.\nDisrespectful conduct by an attorney while in the court\u2019s presence has much greater impact and is much more than merely a dispute between judge and lawyer. \u201cPublic respect for law derives in large measure from the image which the administration of justice presents. It is not enough that justice be done; there must also be the appearance of justice . \u201d ABA Standards, The Defense Function, \u00a7 7.1, Commentary at 260. As Mr. Justice Pomeroy so pertinently stated,\nUnlike the lay person, the lawyer is duty bound to manifest an attitude of professional respect toward the court and its processes. His conduct in the courtroom can have great impact on the extent to which the proceedings are perceived as fair and dignified by juror, defendant, witness, and spectator. He possesses the unique capability of denigrating the proceedings through eloquently clothed charges of impropriety.\nIn re: Johnson, 467 Pa. at 565, 359 A.2d at 746 (Pomeroy, J., dissenting).\nThe suppression judge appropriately characterized appellant\u2019s remarks as impertinent. A lawyer may become frustrated when his objections are repeatedly overruled, but this does not give him license to publicly insult the judge\u2019s intelligence. Appellant\u2019s questioning the judge as to whether he understood the law of hearsay was manifestly improper. Furthermore, appellant\u2019s later comment that he and the judge \u201cought to be on equal terms\u201d when discussing the law and his comment upon the judge\u2019s \u201ctemperament and patience\u201d evidence a clear lack of respect for the office of judge. By directing impertinences to the judge, appellant has engaged in conduct warranting firm disapproval even though the conduct did not rise to the level of contempt.\nJudgment of sentence reversed and appellant discharged.\nEAGEN, C. J., filed a concurring opinion.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which O\u2019BRIEN and. KAUFFMAN, JJ., join.\nNIX and LARSEN, JJ., filed dissenting opinions.\n. Appeal is taken pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, Art. II, \u00a7 202(5), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(5), (current version at 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722(4) (Pamph.1979)).\n. We are clearly dealing with direct criminal contempt since the court\u2019s primary purpose was vindication of its dignity and authority and the allegedly contumacious behavior occurred in the actual presence of the court. See Commonwealth v. Marcone, 487 Pa. 572, 410 A.2d 759 (1980).\n. Act of June 16, 1836, P.L. 784, \u00a7 24, (current version at 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 4132 (Pamph.1979)).\n. Act of December 30, 1974, P.L. 1052, No. 345, \u00a7 1, as amended, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1301 et seq. (Supp.1979-80).\n. The guidelines for determining the appropriateness of an order of probation are set forth in 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1322:\n\u00a7 1322. Order of probation\nThe following grounds, while not controlling the discretion of the court, shall be accorded weight in favor of an order of probation:\n(1) The criminal conduct of the defendant neither caused nor threatened serious harm.\n(2) The defendant did not contemplate that his conduct would cause or threaten serious harm.\n(3) The defendant acted under a strong provocation.\n(4) There were substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the criminal conduct of the defendant, though failing to establish a defense.\n(5) The victim of the criminal conduct of the defendant induced or facilitated its commission.\n(6) The defendant has compensated or will compensate the vic- . tim of his criminal conduct for the damage or injury that he sustained.\n(7) The defendant has no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present crime.\n(8) The criminal conduct of the defendant was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur.\n(9) The character and attitudes of the defendant indicate that he is unlikely to commit another crime.\n(10) The defendant is particularly likely to respond affirmatively to probationary treatment.\n(11) The confinement of the defendant would entail excessive hardship to him or his dependents.\n(12) Such other grounds as indicate the desirability of probation.\n. The court below did not identify the specific subsection of Section 23 pursuant to which it acted. Because the appellant states in his brief that he was held in contempt under subsection III and because we are of the opinion that the misbehavior must fall within the purview of subsection III, if it comes within 17 P.S. \u00a7 2041 at all, we do not consider the applicability of the other subsections.\n. Because we find appellant\u2019s conviction to be unsupported by the evidence and reverse the judgment of sentence on this ground, we need not reach appellant\u2019s due process claim that he should have been tried before a judge other than the one who presided at the suppression hearing and at whom the complained of language was directed."}
