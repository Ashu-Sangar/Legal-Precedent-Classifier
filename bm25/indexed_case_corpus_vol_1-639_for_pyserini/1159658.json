{"id": "1159658", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThe appellant, who was the plaintiff below, filed suit against the appellee in an action in trespass for malicious prosecution and false arrest. He claimed that the defendant, Pitt Publishing Company, falsely charged that he.\u201carmed with a revolver did unlawfully on a public highway attack and rob affiant [an employee of defendant] of valuable papers of the value of $10.\u201d Upon this charge he was arrested, restrained of his liberty, and required to furnish bond for hearing, later being discharged by the jfistice of the peace. After trial the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $25,250. Eules by defendant were entered for judgment n. o. v. and for a new trial. The rule for judgment n. o. v. was made absolute on the ground that the proof did not show that the individual who had the plaintiff arrested was authorized so to do by the defendant company.\nThis is the background of this case: In 1926, the plaintiff bought a regular newspaper route of the Sun-Telegraph. Sometime later the defendant became the publisher of this newspaper, and a controversy arose among the distributors, the result of which was that the circulation manager orally agreed that the dealers would be guaranteed the right to distribute this paper on their routes if they would cease delivering the Press. The plaintiff complied with this condition. He claims that sometime pifior to the present controversy the defendant had been trying to take over his route and had been endeavoring to ascertain who his customers were. The plaintiff then talked to the circulation manager, stating that he would be willing to sell his route. The latter replied : \u201cThis is a big company. We don\u2019t buy anything like that; we will just go and take it.\u201d On July 28,1930, a number of defendant\u2019s employees followed plaintiff\u2019s newsboys. Later plaintiff was informed that one of defendant\u2019s employees, Conner, was following another of his newsboys on his route, taking down customers\u2019 names. Plaintiff caught up with Connor, asked him to hand over the slips in his hand containing these names and to stop following the boys. A few days later plaintiff was arrested on the charge of \u201chighway robbery and carrying firearms.\u201d Subsequently it was more specifically charged that he robbed affiant of valuable papers of the value of $10. He gave a bond for a hearing, and was later discharged.\nThe question here is: Was there sufficient evidence to go to the jury, which, if credited, would constitute legal support of the finding that Connor in making a criminal information against Kirschman was acting on the authority of the defendant? Plaintiff attempted to tie the Pitt Publishing Company (defendant) to his arrest, by the testimony of three witnesses, including himself. First, he testified that he asked Connor why the latter had had him arrested and Connor replied: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to do it, but if I didn\u2019t do it, the Sun-Telegraph would have fired me.\u201d This testimony is incompetent to prove Connor\u2019s authority to make the information. At most, it expresses only Connor\u2019s opinion of what would have happened to him if he had not taken this action against Kirschman. This opinion must have been based upon either a conjecture or on what somebody connected with the \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d had told him. Who this somebody was does not appear, and if it did it would have to be followed by proof that this person had authority to act for the Pitt Publishing Company on a matter \u00f3f this kind. This testimony is too imponderable to count for anything in the legal scales which determine whether plaintiff came forward with the proof required. Plaintiff also called in rebuttal an officer named Zygello, who testified that he was near a group of Sun-Telegraph men who had congregated about five o\u2019clock in the afternoon of July 28, 1930. A man whom he described as \u201cone of the bosses\u201d \u201cwent in,\u201d the witness said, \u201cand telephoned to the Sun-Telegraph and when he came out he said, \u2018Con-nor, if you don\u2019t make an information against him, you will be fired.\u2019 \u201d All the witness knew as to the identity of this man ivas that \u201che represented himself to be one of the bosses.\u201d Zygello\u2019s testimony obviously possesses no probative value on the pivotal issue.\nPlaintiff particularly relies upon the testimony of Miss Helen Kirschman, his daughter, who testified that subsequent to the arrest of her father she was called on the telephone from the Sun-Telegraph office by Mr. Bloom, who was the circulation manager for the paper at that time. She was asked: \u201cWhat did he say to you with respect to that matter that your father had at Alderman Verona\u2019s office? A. He said the suit that was started, he knows it wouldn\u2019t be heard and my Dad didn\u2019t have to appear at Verona\u2019s office. Q. Did he tell you what the suit was for that he was talking about? A. Highway robbery. Q. Did he say it was the suit that the Sun-Telegraph had started? A. Yes, he did.\u201d This last question was highly improper and if objected to it would undoubtedly have been excluded. But even this question and answer unobjected to do not constitute evidence of sufficient weight to carry the case to the jury. The question was obviously \u201ca catch question.\u201d It assumed a fact not in evidence, to wit, that this suit had been started by the Sun-Telegraph. No such fact had been established, even assuming that the \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d and the Pitt Publishing Company are synonymous (an assumption to which the plaintiff with the burden resting upon him is not entitled). No court with due regard for justice would ever permit such an improper question, with its answer, to be used as the sole or chief support of the heavy burden resting upon plaintiff in an action of this kind. Questions of this character have always met with the condemnation of judicial tribunals. Joseph Chitty in his Praetice of the Law (2d ed.), volume III, page 901, says: \u201cIt is an established rule, as regards cross-examination [and, of course, it is an even stronger rule in direct examination, as here], that a counsel has no right, even in order to detect or catch a witness in a falsity, falsely to assume or pretend that the witness had previously sworn or stated differently to the fact, or that a matter had previously been proved, when it had not [italics supplied]. Indeed, if such attempts were tolerated, the English Bar would soon be debased below the most inferior of society.\u201d In Hardy\u2019s Trial, 24 How. St. Tr. 754, Mr. Erskine was cross-examining a witness to the proceedings of an alleged seditious meeting, and asked: \u201cThen you were never at any of those meetings but in the character of a spy?\u201d \u2014 \u201cAs you call it so, I will take it so.\u201d This method of questioning was then and there condemned by Lord Chief Justice Eyre. A case in which a question closely paralleling in attempted adroitness the question in the case at bar occurred in the Parnell Commission\u2019s Proceedings, 19th day, Times\u2019 Rep. pt. 5, page 221. The \u201cLondon Times\u201d had charged the Irish Land League with complicity in crime and outrage. A constable testifying to outrages was cross-examined by the opponents as to his partisan employment by the \u201cTimes\u201d in procuring its evidence. The question asked him was as follows: \u201cHow long have you been engaged in getting up the case for the \u2018Times\u2019?\u201d The following colloquy then took' place: Sir H. James : \u201cWhat I object to is that Mx*. Lockwood, without having any foundation for it, should ask the witness \u2018How long have you been engaged in getting up the case for \u201cThe Times\u201d?\u201d\u2019 Mr. Lockwood \u2014 \u201cI will not argue with my learned friend as to the exact form of the question, but I submit that it is perfectly proper and regular. If the man has not been engaged in getting the case for \u2018The Times\u2019 he can say so.\u201d Sir H. James: \u201cI submit that my learned friend has no right to put this question without foundation. Counsel has no right to say \u2018When did you murder A. B.?\u2019 unless there is some foundation for tlie question. . In this same way he has no right to ask \u2018How long have you been engaged in getting up this case?\u2019 for it assumes the fact.\u201d . . . President Hannen : \u201cI do not consider that Mr. Lockwood was entitled to put the question in that form and to assume that the witness has been employed by \u2018The Times.\u2019 \u201d\nWigmore on Evidence, volume II (2d ed.), section 780, says: \u201cA question which assumes a fact that may be in controversy is leading, when put on direct examination, because it affords the willing witness a suggestion of a fact which he might otherwise not have stated to the same effect. Conversely, such a question may become improper on cross-examination> because it may by implication put into the mouth of an unwilling witness, a statement which he never intended to make, and thus incorrectly attribute to him testimony which is not his.\u201d\nWhen the witness was asked the question: \u201cDid he say it was the suit that the Sun-Telegraph had started?,\u201d she was really asked merely to .identify the suit that Mr. Bloom, the circulation manager, had discussed with her in the telephone conversation, the sole purpose of which conversation was to notify her that her father did not have to appear at the alderman\u2019s office. This question and answer cannot fairly he interpreted by anyone as meaning that he (Bloom) had positively informed her that the Sun-Telegraph had started the criminal proceedings against Kirschman. Even if it were given this interpretation, we would still have the question as to what authority Bloom, the circulation manager, had to bind the Pitt Publishing Company in a matter of this kind. However, we do not reach this point in the case because the question itself is open to condemnation and even though it stands in the record unobjected to, no court with due regard for the proprieties of judicial procedure and the just end such procedure serves would permit such a \u201ccatch\u201d question with its answer to constitute the chief or sole support of a verdict. The apparent purpose of this question as opposed to its hidden purpose was to identify the suit that Bloom was talking about. This is plain from the preceding question which was: \u201cDid he [Bloom] tell you what the suit was for that he was talking about? A. Highway robbery.\u201d Then followed the objectionable question already discussed. We will permit this \u201ccatch\u201d question to have no more weight in this case than it would have if it had not masked a hidden import. Its prima fade import was identification of the suit referred to in the telephone conversation as the suit started by a Sun-Telegraph employee; its concealed import was to fix responsibility on the Sun-Telegraph (meaning thereby the Pitt Publishing Co.). Advocates cannot ask questions containing cryptic meanings, elicit answers based upon the question\u2019s apparent meaning and then expect courts to adopt the cryptic meaning as the question\u2019s exclusive import. Suits are not justly won that way.\nThere is no evidence to show that Connor was authorized by the defendant to prosecute Kirschman. There is no evidence to show that such authority could be legitimately inferred from the nature and scope of his employment. It is not necessary to discuss the question of whether or not Bloom was authorized by the defendant to initiate this suit or that such authority could be fairly inferred from the nature and scope of his employment, for Bloom is not on this record sufficiently identified with this suit to bring forward that question. The law as to the liability of a principal for the acts of his alleged agent in instituting a malicious prosecution is set forth in Markley v. Snow, 207 Pa. 447, 56 A. 990. We there held that \u201cthe act of the agent becomes that of the principal only when expressly authorized or when his authority to act may fairly be inferred from the nature and scope of the employment.\u201d This question has more recently been discussed in Farneth v. Commercial Credit Co., 313 Pa. 433, 169 A. 89; Bowman v. Press Publishing Co., 316 Pa. 531, 175 A. 483, and Edwards v. Power Gasoline Co., 109 Pa. Superior Ct. 253, 167 A. 487.\nThe court below did not err in deciding that the conclusion that the Pitt Publishing Co. was responsible for the criminal prosecution of Kirschman, was not legally permissible from the evidence plaintiff produced.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
