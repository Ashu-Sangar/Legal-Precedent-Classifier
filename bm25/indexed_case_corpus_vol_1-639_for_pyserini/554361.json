{"id": "554361", "contents": "Opinion,\nMb. Justice Clark :\nWilliam E. Hance, the testator, was in his lifetime engaged in mercantile pursuits at Plymouth, Luzerne county. He failed financially in November, 1877, and in the year 1883 compromised with his creditors, paying twenty-five per cent, for a release of their respective claims. W. M. Sinclair, one of his creditors, had on the 14th January, 1878, obtained a judgment against him in the Common Pleas of Luzerne county for debt in $659.55 with $8.62 cost. On the 30th June, 1883, this claim was compromised, Sinclair accepting $179.54 \u201c in full satisfaction of the judgment, debt, interest, and costs,\u201d this sum being slightly in excess of twenty-five per cent, of the original debt.\nOn the 4th May, 1885, Hance, having previously made his last will and testament in writing, died, unmarried and without issue. By his will, which was duly probated, he provided, inter alia, as follows: \u201c It is my will and I do order, that the balance due my old creditors, whose claims were compromised, be paid in full. It is my will, that the residue of my estate go to my brother, Edwin A. Hance,\u201d etc. The settlement of his estate shows a balance in the hands of the executors, of $22,134.70.\nIn the distribution the Sinclair judgment was presented to the auditor for allowance, under that clause of the will above quoted. The auditor deducted $179.54; computed interest from 30th June, 1883, the date of th\u00e9 compromise, and awarded Sinclair $566.81 in full of the balance due to him.\nThe appellant contends that, under the terms of the will, the interest ought to have been computed from the date of the rendition of the judgment, 14th January, 1878, to the 30th June, 1883, the date of the compromise, and that the $179.54 then paid, should be treated as a partial payment and the balance ascertained accordingly.\nIt is true that the provision for Sinclair as one of his \u201c old creditors \u201d is to be regarded as a legacy to him. The compromise having been fully executed, Hance was legally discharged from all liability to Sinclair; the original debt was merged in the judgment and the judgment was satisfied. In a legal sense, therefore, there was nothing due \u201d \u2022 Sinclair; the debt had been discharged ; and the interest, as incident to the debt, ceased to accrue when the debt was extinguished. But, in a less restricted and more popular sense, that may be said to be due which in justice and propriety ought to be ppid. When the testator directed that \u201c the balance due his old creditors whose claims were compromised \u201d should be paid, he of course did not mean the balance which was legally due to them, for 'that would be to give the provision no effect whatever. He meant that his executors should pay to them the balance which was justly due and ought to be paid to them respectively, although there was no legal obligation resting upon him for payment thereof, either debt or interest. But if the creditors ought in justice to receive the debt, it is alike just that they should receive the interest; the latter was \u201c due \u201d in the same sense as the former; the payment of the balance due includes both; yet the money, to which Sinclair is entitled under the will, is neither debt nor interest. It is a legacy the amount of which however is to be computed upon the footing of his previous claims.\nWe discover no intention of the testator that the balance was to be of the principal only, or of the principal and part of the interest. The testator\u2019s intention is to be gathered from the words of the will; there is no obscurity, repugnancy, nor ambiguity in the language of the will which calls for explanation ; nor is the intent defectively stated, and the intention, thus clearly expressed, must be carried into effect. That the compromise was computed upon the debt alone, and that a schedule of the debt of each claim was entered in the testator\u2019s book, is of little consequence. These extraneous circumstances cannot affect the plain expression of his will that the \u201c claims of his old creditors \u201d should be paid \u201cin full.\u201d\nThe compromise was of the \u201c debt, interest, and costs \u201d ; the testator\u2019s plain direction is that the \u201c balance due \u201d upon the \u201c claims \u201d shall be paid \u201c in full,\u201d and we understand this to be in full of the balance of the debt, interest, and costs.\nThe decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court is reversed, and the record is remitted, in order that distribution may be made in accordance with this opinion."}
