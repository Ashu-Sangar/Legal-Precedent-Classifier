{"id": "584410", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nIn 1972, appellants petitioned the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County to set aside a 1969 decree of distribution. The court refused the requested relief and dismissed the petition. We affirm.\nOn June 25, 1949, decedent, Mihaly Kasula, then a resident of the Soviet Union, died intestate. For a number of years decedent had resided in Allegheny County and had been employed by the United States Steel Corporation. His estate\u2019s only asset was $2,949.80 in the corporation\u2019s pension fund. Letters of administration were granted to decedent\u2019s grandson, a resident of Allegheny County, on October 30, 1961.\nOn September 6, 1963, the orphans\u2019 court entered a decree which, inter alia, awarded to the Commonwealth, as custodian, the sum of $1,524.53, representing intestate shares of a purported son and daughter of decedent said to be living in the Soviet Union. These shares were to be held by the Commonwealth without escheat subject to the provisions of the Act of July 28, 1953, P.L. 674. Subsequently, on August 12, 1969, upon petition of the administrator, a final decree of distribution was entered. That decree directed the Commonwealth to repay to the estate the sums held, and directed the administrator to distribute that amount to known intestate heirs, three grandchildren of decedent living in the United States. Pursuant to that decree, the balance of the estate was distributed.\nAlmost three years thereafter, on June 19, 1972, a petition to set aside the 1969 decree of distribution was filed by the substitute attorney in fact for the alien claimants. That petition was dismissed. Appellants\u2019 exceptions were then argued before the court en banc and dismissed. This appeal ensued.\nThe critical question presented is whether appellants offered sufficient proof to establish their claim as heirs of Mihaly Kasula. The orphans\u2019 court as factfinder and the court en banc determined that they did not. We conclude that this determination is supported by the evidence, and therefore affirm.\nManifestly, a court may not decree distribution to persons whose identity as proper beneficiaries of a decedent\u2019s estate has not been established. In cases such as this, involving intestacy, two facts must be proved. A claimant must demonstrate not only Ms \u201cidentity as a qualified statutory heir but also that such an heir in fact existed.\u201d Demczuk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 218, 282 A.2d 700, 703 (1971).\nThe burden of proving heirship rests with the claimant. Demczuk Estate, supra; Krepinevich Estate, 433 Pa. 78, 248 A.2d 844 (1969); Bokey Estate, 412 Pa. 244, 194 A.2d 194 (1963); Davis Estate, 365 Pa. 605, 76 A.2d 643 (1950); Link\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 319 Pa. 513, 180 A. 1 (1935). The standard of proof necessary to sustain that burden was set forth by this Court in Bokey Estate, supra at 250, 194 A.2d at 197. We there said that \u201c \u2018the evidence must be so clean-, precise and definite in quality and quantity as to satisfy the court below that the relationsMp claimed existed.\u2019 (Emphasis supplied)\u201d (quoting Link\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 319 Pa. 513, 522-23, 180 A. 1, 5 (1935)). Here, neither the auditing judge nor the court en bane were satisfied that appellants established the claimed relationship.\nBoth the existence of foreign heirs and specifically appellants\u2019 identity as heirs were in controversy here. During the twenty-three years following decedent\u2019s death, appellants presented only the following evidence in support of their claim. On August 16, 1960, Iniurcolleguia, an association of lawyers in Moscow, U.S.S.R., dispatched a letter to the TJMted States Steel Corporation Pension Fund. That letter stated that a certain Nikolai Kasula, an appellant here, asked the association to represent Mm as a beneficiary of Ms father\u2019s estate. Approximately one year later, another letter was sent. That letter stated that the association also represented one Anna Fentsik, a daughter of decedent, who had also survived her father. On May 15, 1969, a power of attorney was executed before a Soviet notary by persons purporting to be Anna and Nikolai, and forwarded to the United States. No other evidence was offered by appellants.\nThe evidence in opposition to appellants\u2019 claim established that repeated requests by counsel for the administrator for evidence of appellants\u2019 entitlement to share in the estate were unproductive. His numerous letters remained unanswered. Moreover, decedent\u2019s grandson testified that neither his mother nor his grandfather (who had lived with him when he resided in the United States) ever mentioned the existence of any children living in the Soviet Union. He further testified that he had \u201clittle interest in the relatively small sum of money involved . . . .\u201d The court, in evaluating the evidence, declared that \u201c[the grandson\u2019s] testimony impressed us as being true.\u201d\nOn the evidence before it, the orphans\u2019 court concluded that appellants had failed to prove either the existence of any foreign heirs or their own identity as intestate beneficiaries. The court consequently refused to disturb the earlier 1969 adjudication and dismissed appellants\u2019 petition. This action was approved by the court en banc.\nThis Court\u2019s scope of review in cases of this nature is well defined. On appeal, it is not for the appellate court to assess the credibility of the testimony. Our evidentiary review is limited to a determination of whether the findings of fact of the chancellor are supported by sufficient, competent evidence.\n\u201cWe will not retry this case. The question for us to consider is, first, whether there is evidence to support the findings of fact and whether the findings of fact support the decree. The court below and the court en banc made a thorough review of all the evidence and arrived at certain findings. If the evidence supports the findings and the findings in turn justify the decree, the decree will not be set aside . . . .\u201d Pusey\u2019s Estate, 321 Pa. 248, 260, 184 A. 844, 849 (1936) (emphasis in the original, citations omitted); accord, Shewchuk Es tate, 444 Pa. 249, 260, 282 A.2d 807, 313 (1971); Mintz Trust, 444 Pa. 189, 196, 282 A.2d 295, 299 (1971).\nAppellants contend, however, that the court\u2019s findings were contrary to the evidence. Their position, it would appear, is that the recitals of kinship set forth in a power of attorney executed before a notary are conclusive proof of the facts asserted. This Court has held precisely to the contrary. Bokey Estate, supra at 251-52, 194 A.2d at 197-98. Here the power of attorney shows only that persons purporting to be decedent\u2019s children appeared before a notary, asserted their claims of kinship, and in his presence executed the document. As in Bokey Estate, the writing is an assertion, not proof. It is obvious that this document alone or in concert with appellants\u2019 other evidence fails to establish by clear, precise, and definite proof, as required by Bokey Estate, either the existence of any children in the Soviet Union or the affiants\u2019 identity as decedent\u2019s heirs.\nIn the absence of such proof, there is no basis for disturbing the court\u2019s decree.\nDecree affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nNeither appellants\u2019 identities nor entitlement were then adjudicated. In his 1963 petition captioned \u201cpetition to pay balance for distribution,\u201d the administrator clearly questioned the existence of any Soviet heirs, there stating:\n\u201cThere has been no verification of the existence of Nikolai . . . and Anna . . . both of whom are supposed to be living in the TJ.S.S.R. . . .\n\u201c. . . [S]aid petitioner . . . does not believe the existence of said individuals in the TJ.S.S.R. and therefore requests the court at this time to make distribution [awarding a two-thirds interest to the state treasury without escheat] for a limited time, and if the two alleged heirs ... do not claim said funds, then said monies to be decreed to [the known heirs].\u201d\nThis decree was only a partial distribution to known heirs and payment of the balance to the state treasury without escheat. The administrator proposed this distribution to avoid suspending the entire estate for an indefinite period. Because of uncertainty in 1963 as to the existence of a possible aunt and uncle, the administrator merely requested the court to hold the balance of the estate for a reasonable time to see if any competent evidence would surface showing the existence of any other heirs. The 1963 decree by its own terms was not final. Only after waiting six years, during which no evidence of entitlement was produced, did the administrator, in 1969, petition the court to decree final distribution. The dissent mistakenly elevates a 1963 partial custody-type distribution to the status of a final adjudication of appellants\u2019 kinship.\nThis Act, frequently called the \u201cIron Curtain Act,\u201d was since declared unconstitutional, Demczuk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 282 A.2d 700 (1971) ; see Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U.S. 429, 88 S. Ct. 664 (1968), and was repealed. Act of June 30, 3972, P.L. 508, No. 164, \u00a7 3.\nA power of attorney executed in the Soviet Union on May 15, 1969, named the New York law firm of Wolf, Popper, Boss, Wolf & Jones to represent the foreign claimants. New York counsel subsequently nominated James Francis Lawler, Esq., of Philadelphia as substitute attorney in fact.\nSee also Bobko v. Ukrainian Workingmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, 71 Lackawanna Jurist 86 (Pa. C.P. 1970) ; Slotkin Estate, 40 Pa. D. & C.2d 334 (O.C. Phila. 1965), aff\u2019d per curiam, 423 Pa. 628, 222 A.2d 597 (1966) ; Martinzik Estate, 25 Pa. D. & C.2d 701 (O.C. Phila. 1962).\nAny notion that the Act of April 27, 1876, P.L. 49, \u00a7 1, 28 P.S. \u00a7 223 (1958), compels the factfinder to accept as true an affiant\u2019s assertions of kinship is contrary to this Court\u2019s express holding in Bokey Estate, 412 Pa. 244, 194 A.2d 194 (1963). There this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice (now Mr. Chief Justice) Jones, unequivocally held that the statutory phrase \u201cprima facie evidence of the matters therein set forth\u201d refers only to matters set forth by the notary, not to those of the affiants. Id. at 252, 194 A.2d at 198.\nMoreover, this Court in Bokey specifically held: \u201c \u2018The essence of the notarial certificate is that the document has been executed, and that the notary knows that he is confronted by the signer, and that the signer is asserting the fact of his execution.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 252, 194 A.2d at 198 (quoting Scott v. Penn Title Ins. Co., 49 Berks County L.J. 36, 39 (Pa. C.P. 1956)). See Sheaffer v. Baeringer, 346 Pa. 32, 36, 29 A.2d 697, 699 (1943).\nThe dissent inaccurately states the issue in this case. Neither this Court nor the orphans\u2019 court has questioned either the validity or authenticity of appellants\u2019 power of attorney. That American lawyers may, in accordance with the terms of the power, represent appellants before our courts and assert whatever rights appellants may have is not questioned. The power of attorney was here given the same recognition and effect as was done in Demczuk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 282 A.2d 700 (1971), and Bokey Estate, 412 Pa. 244, 194 A.2d 194 (1963). A claimant\u2019s right to have his interests advanced by counsel designated in a power of attorney must not be confused with the issue of proof of kinship in this case. Here the issue is whether the adjudications of the orphans\u2019 court and the court en banc that appellants did not prove their heirship are supported by the record.\nSee Demcmk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 282 A.2d 700 (1971), in which the applicable burden of proof was satisfied. In Demcmk, in addition to producing a power of attorney, the claimant demonstrated his identity by introducing affidavits of heirship executed by members of the village in which decedent\u2019s family resided, and copies of birth, death, and marriage certificates. Collectively, this evidence proved claimant\u2019s identity. Id. at 220-21, 282 A.2d at 704-05. See Comment, The Demise of the \u201cIron Curtain\u201d Statute, 18 Vill. L. Rev. 49, 65 (1972). Obviously, such proof is lacking in this case.\nFor further discussion of the necessity of and means for proving kinship and identity, see .Tones, Pennsylvania Custodial Statutes : Orphans\u2019 Court Proceedings for Recovery of Nonescheated Funds, 39 Temp. L.Q. 153, 164-68 (1966).\nThe dissent erroneously contends that our decision is \u201can unjustified intrusion into the area of foreign affairs.\u201d However, Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U.S. 429, 88 S. Ct. 664 (1968), and Demczuk Estate, 444 Pa. 212, 282 A.2d 700 (1971), upon which the dissent relies, surely do not stand for the proposition that courts may not require proof of heirship before distribution is decreed. Requiring all claimants \u2014 foreign and domestic \u2014 to prove their entitlement is fundamental to the sound administration of estates and does not offend foreign policy.\nIndeed, it has recently been observed: \u201cThe kinship of an alien heir in cases of intestacy, and the existence and identity of the heir are . . . usual matters of proof necessary to establish a valid claim to property .... Such qualifications are unaffected by Zschernig since these judicial inquiries are . . . objective and reasonable. Inquiry into these matters of proof would appear to proceed from a state\u2019s right and duty to guarantee a just distribution of an estate . . . .\u201d Recent Case Note, 72 Dick. L. Rev. 675, 681 (1968) (footnotes omitted).\nHere, claimants were faced with the same burden as American claimants. Any claimant is required to prove his identity and kinship before the orphans\u2019 court can make an award in his favor.\nThe dissent erroneously argues that a foreign claimant having executed a power of attorney asserting the affiant\u2019s kinship is entitled to share in a decedent\u2019s estate without producing corroborative evidence even in the face of other competent and contradictory evidence which the court finds credible. If the dissenting view were to obtain, a foreign claimant by use of a power of attorney would prevail with less evidence of heirship than any other claimant."}
