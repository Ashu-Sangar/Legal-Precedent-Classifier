{"id": "465895", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearns,\nThe sole question in this motor vehicle accident case is whether the defendant was guilty of negligence. The verdict was for the defendant. The refusal of the court below to grant a new trial is the error assigned.\nPlaintiff\u2019s decedent stopped his truck on a branch road approximately twenty feet before its junction with a main highway. The intersection was icy and slippery. The defendant, approaching in a truck from decedent\u2019s left on the highway, attempted to make a right turn into the branch road, but his truck skidded into decedent\u2019s truck, injuring decedent (the death, however, was caused solely by a generalized cancer). It was agreed that the decedent was not eontributorily negligent.\nTwo eyewitnesses to the accident appeared at the trial, one for each party. Their stories were contradictory. Plaintiff\u2019s witness, who was driving a third truck in back of decedent\u2019s truck, stated that defendant\u2019s truck made the right-hand turn at a speed of about thirty miles per hour. Defendant, the other eyewitness, said he had slowed down to five to eight miles per hour. Plaintiff\u2019s witness testified that decedent\u2019s truck was pushed sideways a distance of four to five feet; defendant stated it was moved three or four inches. Plaintiff\u2019s witness said the decedent\u2019s truck had stopped at the time of the collision, while defendant stated it was still moving. It was also denied by defendant that plaintiff\u2019s witness was even in sight at the time of the accident.\nIt is thus obvious that two conflicting versions were presented to the jury. Under plaintiff\u2019s view, the defendant was negligent in approaching the intersection at an excessive rate of speed. Defendant contended, on the contrary, that it was merely a case of skidding, which, of course, does not of itself establish negligence: Simpson v. Jones, 284 Pa. 596, 131 A. 541; Johnson v. American Reduction Co., 305 Pa. 537, 158 A. 153; Dahlman v. Petrovich, 307 Pa. 298, 161 A. 550; Master v. Goldstein\u2019s F. & P., 344 Pa. 1, 23 A. 2d 443; Hatch v. Robinson, 99 Pa. Superior Ct. 141; Wertz v. Shade, 121 Pa. Superior Ct. 4, 182 A. 789; Valley Motor Tran. Co. v. Allison, 153 Pa. Superior Ct. 221, 33 A. 2d 485. The jury returned a verdict for the defendant.\nAs this Court said in Yago v. Pipicelli, 343 Pa. 222, 22 A. 2d 699: \u201cIt has been pointed out in numerous decisions that the granting of a new trial on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence is peculiarly for the court below, and its refusal to grant one for that reason is not, on appeal, a matter for review, in the absence of a palpable abuse of discretion.\u201d See also: O\u2019Farrell v. Mawson, 320 Pa. 316, 182 A. 538. There manifestly was no abuse of discretion. The credibility of the witnesses was properly for the jury.\nPlaintiff\u2019s contention that the verdict is contrary to the incontrovertible physical facts is without merit. We have repeatedly held that this doctrine is inapplicable when dependent upon estimates of distances and the speed of moving objects. See Cunningham v. Pa. R. R. Co., 352 Pa. 571, 43 A. 2d 825, and cases therein cited.\nJudgment affirmed."}
