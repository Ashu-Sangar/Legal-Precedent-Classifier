{"id": "582208", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nAppellant, Mamie Brittain, was charged with the murder of her friend, Deborah Barley. Following a jury-waived trial, the court found appellant guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Post-trial motions were denied, and, on February 27, 1973, sentence of not less than one day nor more than five years imprisonment was imposed. This direct appeal followed. We affirm.\nOn April 10, 1971, the loud playing of a stereo in the Brittain home awakened appellant, who had been taking a nap in an upstairs bedroom. She went downstairs, where Deborah Barley and several mutual friends were listening to music. Deborah was wearing a pair of slacks that she had borrowed without permission from appellant. Appellant recognized her slacks and asked Deborah to remove them. When Deborah refused to comply, an argument ensued. Appellant, who admits she is \u201cvery quick tempered,\u201d then ran upstairs and got a knife. She returned armed and again demanded her slacks, but Deborah refused. Angered, appellant stabbed Deborah once in the chest. The single wound proved fatal.\nPolice were immediately summoned. Officer Rogers of the Philadelphia police arrived, saw the victim prostrate on the floor, and asked what had happened. This general inquiry was directed to no one in particular. Mamie Brittain volunteered, \u201cI stabbed her.\u201d The officer, without first giving appellant the warnings mandated by Miranda v. Arizona then asked her, \u201cWhat did you stab her with?\u201d She responded, \u201cA knife; it is upstairs under the bureau.\u201d The knife was retrieved and appellant taken to police headquarters.\nAt police headquarters, a detective advised appellant of her Miranda rights. Appellant indicated her willingness to talk; within one hour a complete oral confession was obtained.\nPrior to trial, defense counsel moved that all statements given both at the Brittain residence and at police headquarters be suppressed. The motion was denied and the statements introduced into evidence over objection. On this appeal, Brittain challenges the admissibility of her oral statements.\nThere can be no question that appellant\u2019s first statement, \u201cI stabbed her,\u201d was properly admitted. Miranda warnings were not required before Officer Rogers asked generally of the several persons on the scene what had happened. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 477-78, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 1629-30 (1966); Commonwealth v. Jefferson, 423 Pa. 541, 545, 226 A.2d 765, 767-68 (1967). The officer\u2019s initial inquiry cannot be equated with interrogation; appellant\u2019s first response surely was volunteered. Commonwealth v. Yount, 455 Pa. 303, 308, 314 A.2d 242, 245 (1974); Commonwealth v. Miller, 448 Pa. 114, 121 n.2, 290 A.2d 62, 65 n.2 (1972).\nAfter appellant volunteered that she had committed the stabbing, she was, as the Commonwealth correctly recognizes, a suspect. See Commonwealth v. Marabel, 445 Pa. 435, 283 A.2d 285 (1971); Commonwealth v. Sites, 427 Pa. 486, 235 A.2d 387 (1967). Moreover, after appellant gave this incriminating statement, \u201cshe Was certainly not free to leave and at least technically On custody.\u2019\u201d Commonwealth v. Jefferson, supra at 546, 226 A.2d at 768. See Orozco v. Texas, 394 U.S. 324, 89 S. Ct. 1095 (1969); Commonwealth v. D\u2019Nicuola, 448 Pa. 54, 56-58, 292 A.2d 333, 335-36 (1972); Commonwealth v. Sites, supra at 492, 235 A.2d at 390. Appellant\u2019s second statement, \u201cA knife; it is upstairs under the bureau,\u201d should therefore have been suppressed as the product of improper custodial interrogation not preceded by Miranda warnings.\nThe admission of appellant\u2019s second statement is precluded by this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Jefferson, supra. As in Jefferson, Brittain\u2019s first response \u201cwas truly a volunteered, spontaneous, freely-made utterance to general questioning of citizens in the police fact-finding process.\u201d Id. at 545, 226 A.2d at 768. However, after appellant volunteered that she had stabbed Deborah Barley, as in Jefferson, \u201ca new situation had arisen.\u201d Id. Our holding in Jefferson controls the instant case: \u201cAs of then, [Officer Rogers] knew there had been a stabbing and [Brittain] was, by her own admission, the perpetrator. She should immediately have been advised of her right to remain silent before further questioning ensued, and such warning not having been given renders her statements made from that point on constitutionally inadmissible.\u201d Id. Accord, Commonwealth v. Yount, supra at 311, 314 A.2d at 246; Commonwealth v. Feldman, 432 Pa. 428, 432-33, 248 A.2d 1, 3-4 (1968).\nThe Commonwealth argues, however, that Officer Roger\u2019s second question, \u201cWhat did you stab her with?\u201d, was proper as merely a clarifying inquiry. We do not agree. The officer\u2019s second question was interrogation and not a neutral inquiry of a clarifying nature. Only recently this Court held: \u201c[A]fter an incriminating, but ambiguous, statement is volunteered ... a question which does not do \u2018anything more than clarify statements already made,\u2019 in the absence of any coercion or prompting, subtle or overt, is permissible.\u201d Commonwealth v. Yount, supra at 310, 314 A.2d at 246 (emphasis added). See Commonwealth v. Youngblood, 453 Pa. 225, 234, 307 A.2d 922, 927 (1973); Commonwealth v. Simala, 434 Pa. 219, 226 n.2, 252 A.2d 575, 579 n.2 (1969).\nIn Yount, the appellant went to a police station and there volunteered, \u201cI killed that girl,\u201d without specifying his victim. Yount\u2019s incriminating statement was plainly ambiguous. We there held admissible appellant\u2019s identification of his victim given in response to a police question asking him to identify \u201cthat girl.\u201d Here, however, appellant\u2019s initial statement was in no sense ambiguous. By her first statement, volunteered while appellant was standing in the same room with Deborah Barley\u2019s body, appellant indicated both that she had killed someone and identified Deborah as her victim. There was no ambiguity to clarify. The officer\u2019s second question sought more than mere clarification.\nInterrogation as to the details of a crime may not be equated with permissible clarification of ambiguity. Consequently, admission of appellant\u2019s second statement was error. On this record however, this error was clearly harmless beyond a reasonable doubt Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S. Ct. 824 (1967); Commonwealth v. Davis, 452 Pa. 171, 305 A.2d 715 (1973); Commonwealth v. Padgett, 428 Pa. 229, 237 A.2d 209 (1968).\nAppellant\u2019s statement that the stabbing was with a knife, while inadmissible, involved only a description of the weapon used and its location. These details on this record were only repetitive. The essential elements of proof of the weapon already appeared by other evidence in the Commonwealth\u2019s case. At most, Brittain\u2019s statement \u201cplayed an insignificant role in the trial,\u201d and was the subject of \u201cminimal prosecutorial use.\u201d Commonwealth v. Padgett, supra at 238, 237 A.2d at 213-14. Furthermore, no objection to the admission of the knife was interposed.\nMoreover, after proper and adequate Miranda warnings, appellant freely gave an admissible confession at police headquarters. This properly-admitted confession repeated the same details contained in her second, improperly-admitted statement. At trial, appellant also testified to the same details, admitting both the stabbing and the identity of the weapon used. In light of both appellant\u2019s confession and her in-court testimony, it must be concluded that the error of admitting her second statement was cured and its admission rendered harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Brown, 438 Pa. 52, 57, 265 A.2d 101, 104-05 (1970); Commonwealth v. Collins, 436 Pa. 114, 121-22, 259 A.2d 160, 164 (1969); Commonwealth ex rel. Edowski v. Maroney, 423 Pa. 229, 233, 223 A.2d 749, 752 (1966); Commonwealth ex rel. Adderley v. Myers, 418 Pa. 366, 368, 211 A.2d 481, 482-83 (1965); see People v. Jacob son, 63 Cal. 2d 319, 330, 405 P.2d 555, 563, 46 Cal. Rptr. 515, 523 (1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 1015, 86 S. Ct. 1954 (1966).\nFinally, we note that two eyewitnesses testified under oath that they saw appellant stab the victim with the knife, substantially corroborating appellant\u2019s improperly-admitted statement, her confession, and her testimony. This testimony further served to render the error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Davis, supra.\nReview of this record satisfies us that in light of appellant\u2019s properly-admitted confession, her in-court testimony, the substantial corroborative eyewitness testimony, and the minimal impact appellant\u2019s unwarned statement played in this trial, admission of the statement \u201cA knife; it is upstairs under the bureau\u201d was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no basis for disturbing the trial court\u2019s judgment.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nThis Court\u2019s jurisdiction is found in the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp. 1973).\n384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966).\nA written confession was also obtained, but not used at trial.\nAppellant also contends that the knife was improperly admitted into evidence. No pretrial motion to suppress the knife was made; its admissibility, therefore, may not now he questioned. Pa. R. Crim. P. 323(b); Commonwealth v. Sasser, 453 Pa. 622, 309 A.2d 352 (1973). Also, admission of the knife was not objected to at trial.\nSee generally Kamisar, \u201c 'Custodial Interrogation\u2019 Within the Meaning of Miranda,\u201d in Institute of Continuing Legal Education, Criminal Law and the Constitution\u2014Sources and Commentaries 335 (1968).\nAppellant further argues that this confession was tainted by the statement obtained at the Brittain home. See e.g., Commonwealth v. Ware, 438 Pa. 517, 265 A.2d 790 (1970). A prerequisite to impermissible taint, however, is a causal connection between the two statements. Commonwealth v. Rowe, 445 Pa. 454, 458-60, 282 A.2d 319, 321-22 (1971) ; Commonwealth v. Frazier, 443 Pa. 178, 181, 279 A.2d 33, 35 (1971).\nHere, the causal link is missing. Appellant\u2019s full confession cannot be realistically viewed as the product of the disclosure of the detail that she used a knife which was upstairs. If any statement caused appellant\u2019s oral confession, it was the earlier admission, \u201cI stabbed her,\u201d volunteered on the scene in the presence of the police officer and the eyewitnesses.\nAppellant\u2019s argument also overlooks the fact that she testified at trial to the same details contained in the challenged confession. Indeed, appellant\u2019s trial strategy was to admit the stabbing but to show that it was done without premeditation and in anger. See Commonwealth ex rel. Adderley v. Myers, 418 Pa. 366, 211 A.2d 481 (1965)."}
