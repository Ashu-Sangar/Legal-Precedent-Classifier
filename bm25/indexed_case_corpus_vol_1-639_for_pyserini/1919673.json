Blose, 430 Pa. 209, 241 A. 2d 918 (1968).\nThe petition for allocatur is granted, the order of the Superior Court, affirming the denial of the petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, is reversed, the order of the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Cumberland County is vacated and the record is remanded for a new trial.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell dissents."}
