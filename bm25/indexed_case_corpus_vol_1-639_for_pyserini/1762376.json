Ferrell, was convicted of third degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime in connection with a fatal stabbing incident. Appellant presents three arguments on appeal: (1) that error was committed by denying a motion to suppress appellant\u2019s self-incriminating statements; (2) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a third degree murder conviction; and (3) that the Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 906 (1973) bars simultaneous convictions for murder and possession of an instrument of crime.\nAfter a thorough review of the briefs and record, we have found these arguments to be without merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed."}
