{"id": "1776190", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nNIX, Justice.\nThe sole issue in this appeal is whether the referee properly found that the instant employer, The Evening Bulletin, a former Philadelphia newspaper, had knowledge of claimant\u2019s concurrent employment for purposes of computing claimant\u2019s average weekly wage pursuant to Section 309(e) of the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (Act) in effect at the time of the claimant\u2019s injury.\nIn a prior opinion we remanded the instant case to the Commonwealth Court for review of the proper rate of compensation to appellant, Harold D. Katz, after holding that appellant had complied with the notice provisions of the Act, Section 312, 77 P.S. \u00a7 632. Upon remand, 48 Pa. Cmwlth. 425, 409 A.2d 970, the Commonwealth Court held that Section 309(e) requires that the employer know of the other employment if the employee\u2019s wages from all employers are to be considered as if earned from the employer liable for compensation and that claimant\u2019s employer, The Evening Bulletin, did not have \u201cactual\u201d knowledge of his concurrent employment. That court reversed the order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, affirming the referee\u2019s award of benefits to appellant and remanded the case for recomputation. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board which affirmed the referee\u2019s award of benefits.\nThe underlying facts as stated in our prior opinion are as follows:\nAppellant Katz worked part-time as a substitute \u201cmailer\u201d and \u201cstuffer.\u201d In this capacity, he collected newspapers off the presses and, by machine or by hand, stuffed supplements into the papers and stacked them for distribution. Appellant\u2019s union, the Mailer\u2019s Union, acts as the hiring agent [emphasis added] for both the Philadelphia Inquirer and The Evening Bulletin. The newspapers inform the union of the number of substitute part-time mailers they will need on a particular night and the union assigns the jobs to its members.\nOn May 29, 1970, appellant was directed at the union hall to go that evening to the plant of the Bulletin. Until then, appellant had worked only at the Inquirer. Once at the plant appellant spoke only to the man who showed him to his work area. At the end of his work shift, approximately 2:30 a. m. on the morning of the 30th, appellant left the plant building. In an unlighted area of the employee parking lot, he fell over a broken manhole cover and injured himself. Appellant\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation claim arose out of this accident.\n485 Pa. at 538, 403 A.2d at 518 (1979).\nThe applicable provision of the Act in effect on the date of appellant\u2019s injury was Section 309(e), 77 P.S. \u00a7 582(e) which provided in pertinent part:\n\u00a7 582. Wages; computation for purpose of determining compensation\nWhere the employee is working under concurrent contracts with two or more employers and the defendant employer has knowledge of such employment prior to the accident, his wages from all such employers shall be considered as if earned from the employer liable for compensation.\nIn the development of this area of the law, there was a perceived tension between the interests of the employer and employee in determining whether the wage base should be limited to the earnings of the employee in the employment in which the injury occurred or whether it should include the total earnings of the employee. There was a concern that the employer might be required to provide compensation greater than the wages actually earned in that particular employment and the affected carrier would be called upon to make an outlay in excess of the premiums received. It was also contended that employment in a more hazardous occupation would be unfair to the employer providing a less hazardous employment. The illusory quality of the latter concern is readily apparent. Whether the concurrent employment is risky or safe in no way affects the impact of the concurrent employment wage rule on the employer in whose employment an injury has actually occurred.\nEqually as transparent is the first objection. It is obviously repulsive to legislation, that is remedial in intent, to construe such legislation as relegating a claimant to a part-time wage basis, although his actual earnings are that of a full-time member of the labor force. Moreover, any isolated example of an injustice will be eradicated by an overall view of the situation. It is legitimate to consider the employer\u2019s sector as a composite, since that is the perspective used to determine premiums for workmen\u2019s compensation coverage. It is not fair to apply such a perspective to the individual workman whose entire life and that of his family may be dependent upon the award received in a given case. Most state legislatures have, as has Pennsylvania, deleted limitations and permitted wages from all employers to be considered in determining the rate of compensation due. Thus, today, the question before us would not have arisen and appellant clearly would be entitled to have his wages from the concurrent employment calculated in arriving at the appropriate compensation rate.\nThe Commonwealth Court concluded that the former version of Section 309(e) required a demonstration of the \u201cactual\u201d knowledge of the employer of the concurrent employment prior to the injury. In so ruling, that court ignored the long and well established tradition in our law that certain relationships between parties requires the knowledge of one to be imputed to the other. A prominent example of this principle is the relationship between a principal and agent.\nIt is well settled in the law of this jurisdiction that knowledge of an agent, acting within the scope of his authority, real or apparent, may be imputed to the principal, Corn Exchange Nat. Bank & Trust Co. v. Burkhart, 401 Pa. 535, 165 A.2d 612 (1960); Evans v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 294 Pa. 406, 144 A. 294 (1928); Matthews v. Rush, 262 Pa. 524, 105 A. 817 (1919) and therefore, knowledge of the agent is knowledge of the principal. Fidelity Bank v. Pierson, 437 Pa. 541, 264 A.2d 682 (1970); Nat. Bank of Bedford v. Stever, 169 Pa. 574, 32 A. 603 (1895).\nIt is a conceded fact in this record that the Bulletin elected to use the Mailer\u2019s Union as the hiring agent for obtaining employees to fulfill the task in question. It is also without doubt that the Union was aware that the persons selected to serve as substitute \u201cmailers\u201d and \u201cstuffers\u201d were drawn from a pool which performed the same services for other employers. As noted in the opinion of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, \u201c. .. it is a common practice in the newspaper industry to hire these substitutes on a regular basis for weekend purposes.\u201d\nGiving full deference to the then existing legislative perception of fairness to the employer, we do not share the view of the Commonwealth Court that it requires an interpretation of Section 309(e) that would insulate the employer against knowledge concededly possessed by the employer\u2019s agent. The employer chose to delegate the hiring decision to its agent, the Union. The knowledge relevant to that decision possessed by the agent cannot be avoided by the principal. Accepting the Commonwealth Court\u2019s premise that the legislature enacted the 1939 amendment to Section 309(e) to satisfy due process concerns, see 1A, Barbieri, Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 5.38(12) (1975), those concerns would not justify ignoring the relevant facts possessed by the employer\u2019s hiring agent. We therefore reject the Commonwealth Court\u2019s implicit conclusion that the then existing knowledge requirement must be interpreted as excluding the well settled principle that the principal is charged with the knowledge of its agent.\nAccordingly, we hold that the referee correctly found that the Bulletin had prior knowledge of appellant\u2019s concurrent employment for purposes of Section 309(e). The Order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the award of the referee as affirmed by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board is reinstated.\n.

In 1972, the legislature amended Section 309(e) to delete the knowledge requirement. The amended version states: \u201cWhere the employee is working under concurrent contracts with two or more employers, his wages from all such employers shall be considered as if earned from the employer liable for compensation. 77 P.S. \u00a7 582(e) (Supp.1981-1982).\n. See 3A 2 Larson\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation, \u00a7 60.30.\n. See footnote 3.\n. The original version of the Act which was adopted in 1915, Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, art. III, \u00a7 309, did not contain the knowledge limitation upon wages of concurrent employments. In 1939 that requirement was first added. Act of June 21, 1939, P.L. 520, \u00a7 1."}
