{"id": "878695", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Cegdee Justice Stebbett,\nThis case was argued with number 209 July term, 1895\u2014 John W. Peale against same defendant \u2014 supra, p. 543, in which an opinion has just been filed. In principle, the eases are substantially the same. The only alleged difference, that need be noticed, is that in the case referred to the suit was brought by the person for whose accommodation the indorsement by the defendant was made. Li this case, the plaintiff is the immediate indorsee of that person, and received the note from him after maturity. If this be so, he is in no better position than the accommodated indorsee \u2014 the plaintiff in the other case: Clay v. Cottrell, 18 Pa. 408; Bower v. Hastings, 36 Pa. 285; Wilson v. Savings Bank, 45 Pa. 488; Hoffman v. Foster, 43 Pa. 137 ; Chester v. Dorr, 41 N. Y. 285. In one of these cases,\u2014 Bower v. Hastings, \u2014 it was held to be a good defense, in; an action by an indorsee against the maker of a promissory note, \u201c\u25a0that it was made for the accommodation of the payee, without consideration, and negotiated by him when overdue.\u201d The fact that the note in suit was indorsed and delivered to the plaintiff, after maturity, by the party for-whose accommodation the indorsement was made, is distinctly set forth in plaintiff\u2019s statement, and also in the affidavit of defense.\nAgain, as was said in Wilson v. Savings Bank, supra, \u201c A pe'rson who takes a bill or note after it is due, takes it subject to all objections in respect of want of consideration or illegality, and all other objections and equities affecting the instrument itself and to which it was liable in the hands of the person from whom he takes it.\u201d The fact that defendant\u2019s indorsement was without consideration, and made at the request of John W. Peale, by whom the note was indorsed and delivered to plaintiff after maturity, sufficiently appears in the affidavit of defense.\n. \u2022 We: think the learned court erred in holding that the .affidavit of defense is insufficient, as well as in assuming the sufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s statement.\nJudgment reversed and procedendo awarded."}
