{"id": "1775336", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nAppellant, John Rush, appeals from the denial of relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act [PCHA], Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-1 to 14 (Supp. 1979-1980). The issue of the admissibility of his confession was decided adversely to him in his direct appeal, Commonwealth v. Rush, 459 Pa. 23, 326 A.2d 340 (1974), and is therefore finally litigated. PCHA supra at 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-4(a)(3); Commonwealth v. Slavik, 449 Pa. 424, 297 A.2d 920 (1972).\nAppellant also asserts that his trial counsel were ineffective for not raising objections to hearsay testimony implicating John Rush; to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning availability of witnesses to the defense not called but subpoenaed by the Commonwealth; to the prosecutor\u2019s remarks made during summation and finally for not raising on appeal the admissibility of a hearsay statement as a dying declaration. Our examination of the record satisfies us that these contentions are without merit. See Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A.2d 349 (1967). Therefore, the Order of the Court below is affirmed.\nMcDERMOTT, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case."}
