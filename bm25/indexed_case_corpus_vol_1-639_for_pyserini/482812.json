{"id": "482812", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nEAGEN, Justice.\nIn a nonjury trial, Melvin Fields was convicted of murder in the second degree and conspiracy. Motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were denied, and a prison sentence was imposed on the murder conviction. This appeal was then filed.\nThe only issue posed by the appeal is whether or not the evidence at trial was sufficient to sustain the murder conviction. We conclude it was not.\nAs we have said many times previously, \u201c \u2018[T]he test of the sufficiency of the evidence ... is whether, accepting as true all the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom, upon which if believed the jury could properly have based its verdict, it is sufficient in law to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime or crimes of which he has been convicted.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Smith, 447 Pa. 457, 463, 291 A.2d 103, 105 (1972).\nThe instant prosecution stemmed from the fatal shooting of Herman Press. The Commonwealth\u2019s case against the appellant, Fields, was presented in this manner.\nThe first witness was Johnnie May Gale, who testified that on September 25, 1972, about 10:30 p. m., she and Press were seated on the doorstep in front of her residence on West Dauphin Street in Philadelphia, when \u201ctwo boys\u201d whom she did not know and could not identify \u201ccame around the corner and said to Herman [Press] are you from 29?\u201d When asked what happened then, Miss Gale responded, \u201cThey shot him\u201d and then fled. Then in answer to the question, \u201cHow many people shot him, one or two?\u201d, the witness replied \u201cOne\u201d.\nThe next witness was Alan Presbury, who testified that while he was in the kitchen of his residence which was \u201caround the corner\u201d on 31st Street from Miss Gale\u2019s residence, he heard \u201csome shots\u201d; that he ran to the front door and \u201csaw three men running past the door\u201d; that he recognized one as Fields and another as Leroy Gause, both of whom he knew before; and that as the three ran he saw Fields move his hands \u201cdown into his pants .... Like he had something under his shirt.\u201d When asked if he saw any weapons, the witness said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d\nThe third and final witness for the Commonwealth was a police detective who testified that he went to a hospital shortly after the shooting; that Press was in the emergency room and in response to questions said he was seated on the steps with his girl friend when \u201cBoonie [Leroy Gause] and Melvin Fields came up and asked if I was from 29. He didn\u2019t give me a chance to answer. He just shot about five times.\u201d When asked who shot him, Press said \u201cBoonie\u201d.\nThe report of the medical examiner was then made part of the record by stipulation. It evidenced that Press had been wounded five times from gunshots; that one such wound, from which a .22 caliber bullet was recovered, demonstrated the bullet penetrated the liver, right renal artery and inferior vena cava.\nWhile the Commonwealth concedes Gause did the shooting, it has and still urges that Fields aided and abetted therein. Of course, if this were so, Fields would be criminally responsible the same as Gause, the principal felon.\nTo \u201caid or abet\u201d in the commission of a crime one must be an active partner in the intent to commit it. Commonwealth v. McFadden, 448 Pa. 146, 292 A.2d 358 (1972), and Commonwealth v. Strantz, 328 Pa. 33, 195 A. 75 (1937). While this may be established by circumstantial evidence, the proof must lead to more than suspicion and conjecture. See Commonwealth v. McFadden, supra. Furthermore, mere presence at the scene of a crime is not in itself, sufficient to establish that one is an active partner in the intent of another to commit the crime. Cf. Commonwealth v. Leach, 455 Pa. 448, 317 A. 2d 293 (1974), and Commonwealth v. Pierce, 437 Pa. 266, 263 A.2d 350 (1970). Likewise, flight from the scene of a crime, without more, is not enough to show one is such an active partner. Cf. Commonwealth v. Roscioli, 454 Pa. 59, 309 A.2d 396 (1973); and, Commonwealth v. Bailey, 448 Pa. 224, 292 A.2d 345 (1972).\nIn our view, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was inadequate, as a matter of law, to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Fields was an active partner in Gause\u2019s intent to shoot Press. Read in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the record proves that Fields arrived' at the scene of the shooting with \u201cBoonie\u201d, the killer; that he may have asked Press if he \u201cwas from 29\u201d; that after \u201cBoonie\u201d shot Press, Fields ran from the scene with \u201cBoonie\u201d. There is nothing in the testimony to indicate Fields had any prior knowledge of Gause\u2019s lethal intent or that he in any way counseled or participated in the shooting. Under the circumstances, the proof left too much to conjecture.\nJudgment reversed, and Fields is ordered discharged.\nJONES, C. J., and NIX, J., dissent.\n. Sentence was suspended on the conspiracy conviction.\n. This evidence was admitted as a dying declaration without objection.\n. See Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, \u00a7 1105, as amended, 18 P.S. \u00a7 5105 (repealed 1972), which was extant on the date of the crime.\n. It is not clear from the testimony if Fields was the one who asked the question."}
