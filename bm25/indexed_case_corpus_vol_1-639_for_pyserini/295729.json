{"id": "295729", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWhen this case was here before (267 Pa. 483) we ruled that the issues involved were for the jury; since then they have been submitted to a jury and found against defendant.\nThe following excerpt from the opinion of the court below, entering judgment for plaintiff, is all that need be said in disposing of the present appeal: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s contention now is, that the opinion of the Supreme Court [referred to above] was largely based on admission of facts in the record [of the first trial] and that the evidence produced on the second trial was not of such a character as to sustain the verdict; we cannot agree with this contention. In our judgment there is no substantial difference in the facts admitted on the first trial and the proofs offered on the second; and there is nothing in the facts and circumstances which developed on the second trial that would warrant the court in saying as a matter of law that the deceased was guilty of contributory negligence.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed."}
