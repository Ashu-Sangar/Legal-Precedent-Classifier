{"id": "1818955", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis appeal requires us to interpret Pa.R.Crim.P. 229 in reviewing the propriety of amending a criminal complaint at trial to include victims of assault who were not named in the original complaint. The trial court allowed the amendment on the ground that appellant was not surprised or prejudiced by the addition of new victims, and appellant was convicted. We reverse, due to violation of Rule 229.\nThe appellant, Frank DeSumma, was offended one evening by the inconsiderate driving of Frank O'Hara, who cut him off in traffic. Appellant exchanged angry words with O\u2019Hara, then displayed a handgun, menacing O\u2019Hara and his four passengers, while the two vehicles were proceeding side-by-side on the highway. After both drivers pulled off the highway, a police officer arrived and took statements of the parties. Appellant voluntarily surrendered his loaded handgun, which he was licensed to carry, and was then arrested and charged with simple assault upon O\u2019Hara and recklessly endangering O\u2019Hara, in violation of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2701(a)(3) and 2705. Appellant was not charged with assaulting or endangering the four passengers, though their names were available in the police report.\nAt appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing, only O\u2019Hara and the arresting officer testified against appellant. None of the passengers appeared at the hearing. The Commonwealth established a prima facie case through O\u2019Hara\u2019s testimony that appellant pointed a gun at him while both were driving their cars, and by the officer reading his report into the record, including the portion identifying the four passengers.\nBefore appellant\u2019s trial, however, O\u2019Hara disappeared and could not be subpoenaed to testify for the Commonwealth. One of the passengers, Michelle Sharper, was available and was summoned to testify. Due to O\u2019Hara\u2019s absence, the Commonwealth moved to amend the information to add the names of the four passengers, requesting that the first count charge appellant with assaulting O\u2019Hara and four named passengers and the second count charge appellant with recklessly endangering O\u2019Hara and four named passengers. Because the four passengers had been identified by name at the preliminary hearing, the trial court granted the motion, reasoning that appellant could not claim surprise and that the amendment did not prejudice him in any way. The court categorically refused, however, to add counts naming individual passengers in the additional counts. Over appellant\u2019s objection, he was tried on the amended two-count complaint, wherein each count named five victims instead of one.\nFollowing a jury trial, appellant was convicted of simple assault; he was acquitted of recklessly endangering another person. Superior Court affirmed his judgment of sentence, following the rationale of the trial court. Judge Wieand, in dissent, expressed the opinion that the amendment did not comply with Pa.R.Crim.P. 229, which prohibits amendments charging additional or different offenses. Relying on cases such as Commonwealth v. Johnson, 336 Pa.Super. 1, 485 A.2d 397 (1985), and Commonwealth v. Stanley, 265 Pa.Super. 194, 401 A.2d 1166 (1979), aff'd 498 Pa. 326, 446 A.2d 583 (1982), the dissent maintained that the purpose of Rule 229 is to give a defendant adequate notice and time to prepare for trial without risk of last-minute additions to the charge which materially alter potential defenses. Judge Wieand concluded that the amendment was prejudicial because it added an additional and different offense:\nHe arrived for trial anticipating that he would be required to defend against a charge that he had pointed a loaded gun at O\u2019Hara with the intent of putting O\u2019Hara in fear of imminent bodily injury. At trial, however, he found that he was required to defend against an accusation that he had intended to put in fear of bodily injury the passengers in the other vehicle with whom he had not exchanged words and with whom he had no quarrel. Until the time when trial started, there had not been either accusation or testimony that appellant had intended to menace anyone but the driver with whom he had quarreled.\nCommonwealth v. DeSumma, 367 Pa.Super. 634, 640-41, 533 A.2d 453, 456 (1987) (dissenting opinion).\nPa.R.Crim.P. 229 provides:\nRULE 229. AMENDMENT OF INFORMATION\nThe court may allow an information to be amended when there is a defect in form, the description of the offense, the description of any person or any property, or the date charged, provided the information as amended does not charge an additional or different offense. Upon amendment the court may grant such postponement of trial or other relief as is necessary in the interests of justice.\n(Emphasis added.) This rule, taken in conjunction with the holding of Commonwealth v. Frisbie, 506 Pa. 461, 485 A.2d 1098 (1984), bars the amendment which was permitted in this case.\nIn Frisbie, this Court overruled the notion that \u201c[wjhere there is but one act of cause of injury, or death of a number of persons, there is but one injury to the Commonwealth\u201d; we therefore held it permissible for a court \u201cto impose multiple sentences on a defendant for a single act.\u201d Id., 506 Pa. at 465, 485 A.2d at 1099. Thus Frisbie was charged with nine separate counts of recklessly endangering another person due to a single reckless act which endangered nine people, garnering him nine separate consecutive sentences for the nine offenses. We stated that \u201cin resolving the issue of whether a single act which injures multiple victims can be the basis for multiple sentences, our task is to simply determine whether the legislature intended that each injury constitute a separate offense.\u201d Id., 506 Pa. at 466, 485 A.2d at 1100.\nIn construing 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2705, recklessly endangering another person, the Frisbie court concluded that the offense was defined \u201cwith respect to an individual person being placed in danger of death or serious bodily injury, and that a separate offense is committed for each individual person placed in such danger.\" Id. (Emphasis supplied.) Similarly, in Commonwealth v. Williams, 514 Pa. 124, 130, 522 A.2d 1095, 1098 (1987), we held that an attempt to murder three people by a single act of arson would constitute three separate offenses of attempted murder, for criminal homicide is defined as causing \u201cthe death of another human being.\" (Emphasis added.) The same is true of simple assault, prohibited by 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2701(a)(3), which states that a person commits assault if he \u201cattempts by physical menace to put another in fear of imminent serious bodily injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) With respect to crimes defined in such language, the number of offenses depends on the number of victims rather than on the number of acts committed by a defendant.\nApplying this interpretation to the case of appellant, it is clear that a charge of attempting to put O\u2019Hara in fear of bodily injury is a different offense than a charge of attempting to put O\u2019Hara, Michelle Sharper, and three other passengers in fear of bodily injury. The latter, in fact, constitutes five separate offenses against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth. It is therefore clear that the amendment of appellant\u2019s information at trial from an assault upon O\u2019Hara to an assault upon five people was impermissible under Rule 229 which prohibits an amendment from charging \u201can additional or different offense.\u201d\nThe prejudice engendered by the eleventh-hour amendment is obvious. It was implicit in the quoted portion of Judge Wieand\u2019s dissenting opinion, supra, in that at least two defenses \u2014 justification under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 503 or consent under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 311 \u2014 might have been raised with respect to O\u2019Hara but not with respect to the remaining passengers. Other potential defenses may have been vitiated as well by the amendment.\nAccordingly, the order of the Superior Court is reversed, and appellant is discharged.\nNIX, C.J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nPAPADAKOS, J., files a dissenting opinion in which McDermott, j., joins."}
