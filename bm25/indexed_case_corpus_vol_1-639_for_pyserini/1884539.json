{"id": "1884539", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nA Pittsburgh police car, operated by Patrolman Cyrus Cramer, came into collision with an automobile owned by Dominick Dinardo and operated by his son Thomas Dinardo. Cramer brought an action of trespass against Thomas Dinardo for personal injuries; the City of Pittsburgh sued Thomas Dinardo for damages sustained to its vehicle; Dominick Dinardo sued Cyrus Cramer in one action and the City of Pittsburgh in another action for his property damage.\nThe four cases were consolidated for trial. The jury in open court orally announced in Case No. 1 that both drivers were negligent. In Case No. 2, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant Dinardo. In announcing its verdict in Case No. 3, confusion developed. No. 1 juror said they found in favor of Dimardo. No. 5 juror volunteered: \u201cIt can\u2019t be,\u201d whereupon No. 1 juror said: \u201cI am sorry. I probably answered that improperly,\u201d and then added: \u201cThere is no fault found.\u201d After interrogation by the court, juror No. 1 changed from \u201cno fault found\u201d to \u201cWe found negligence on the part of them.\u201d In Case No. 4, juror No. 1 announced \u201cNegligence on both parts.\u201d Since the owner Dinardo was not present at the accident and was not involved tortiously, the question would arise as to whether, in view of Cramer\u2019s declared negligence, owner Dinardo would not be entitled to a monetary verdict for his property damage.\nThe trial court instructed the jury to return for further deliberation. On the way from the courtroom to the jury room, juror No. 1 had a seizure of some kind and was unconscious for about fifteen minutes. The court, then, on its own motion, declared a mistrial. The defendant Dinardo appealed seeking a reinstatement of the verdicts arguing that the trial court was without power to declare a mistrial, once the verdicts had been recorded.\nWe cannot say, in view of the extraordinary situation which developed when the jurors were reporting their verdicts, that the point of no return, as to unalterability of verdict, had been reached.\nIn the case of Eastley v. Glenn, 313 Pa. 130, the jurors, coming to the end of their deliberations of a late Friday afternoon, sealed their verdict and returned to their respective homes. On the following Monday morning, they handed their verdict to the trial judge who read it, and handed it to the clerk who stated in the usual form: \u201cMembers of the jury, hearken to your verdict as the court has recorded it; in this issue joined [naming the parties], you say you find a verdict for the defendant and so say you all?\u201d There was no dissent.\nCounsel for the plaintiff then polled the jury and two of the jurors stated that they had voted for the plaintiff. The court ordered the verdict be entered as a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff appealed. In reversing the action of the trial court, Justice Kephart, later Chief Justice, said: \u201cAs the trial judge intimated, the reception of the verdict was irregular. Reading the verdict slip with the prefix, . . hearken to your verdict as the court has recorded it,\u2019 followed by an oral dissent, with or without poll, by a member of the jury before dismissal, is not returning or recording a verdict as is required by law. When a jury is polled, as stated in Snaman v. Donahoe\u2019s, Inc., 307 Pa. 282, 285: \u2018The only verdict is that which the jury announces orally in court and which is received and recorded at the direction of the court as the finding of the jury.\u2019 To the same effect is Rottmund v. P.R.R. Co., 225 Pa. 410, 414: \u2018 \u201cThere is no verdict of any force except a public verdict, given openly in court\u201d ... All the authorities agree that the only verdict is that which the jury announce orally in court and which alone is received and recorded as the jury\u2019s finding.\u2019 The written verdict, prepared in the jury room and handed to the clerk, when it is objected to as in this case, is no part of the record and has absolutely no significance whatever as the verdict of the jury; the verdict is the oral announcement. . . .\n\u201cThe verdict in this case was not ordered recorded until the close of the discussion in the assignment room. Prior to that time two jurors, when polled, had varied from the verdict which had been read to them from the form sent with the jury to the jury room. In Scott v. Scott, 110 Pa. 387, 390, where substantially the same situation occurred, it was said: \u2018 \u201cAfter the verdict recorded the jury cannot vary from it, but before it be recorded they may vary from the first offer of their verdict, and that verdict which is recorded shall stand; . . .,\u201d \u2019 and we find no reason to alter this rule.\u201d\nThe Eastley decision was cited with approval by Chief Justice Maxey in the case of Commonwealth v. Johnson, 359 Pa. 287, where he also quoted from Scott v. Scott, 110 Pa. 387: \u201c \u2018After the verdict recorded the jury cannot vary from it, but before it be recorded they may vary from the first offer of their verdict, and that verdict which is recorded shall stand.\u2019 \u201d\nIn the present case, conflicting statements were \u2022made by the jurors as to just what their verdicts were. Therefore, the verdicts could not be recorded at that point. While they were in the process of proceeding to possible reconciliation of views with a unanimously reached conclusion to end their labors, one of the jurors was felled by a seizure which could not help but affect the deliberating equilibrium of the rest of the jurors. At any rate, the trial judge, who was present, was of that opinion, and we cannot say, in reviewing the entire matter, that he was in error or that he abused his discretion in ordering a new trial.\nAffirmed."}
