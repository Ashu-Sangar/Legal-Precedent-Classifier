{"id": "1708125", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nThe only issue involved in this appeal is whether a spring-activated hand gun which shoots small steel pellets (commonly called B-B-s), is a \u201cfirearm\u201d within the meaning of Section 716 of the Penal Code, Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872,18 P.S. \u00a7 4716. The statute proscribes the pointing of \u201ca gun, pistol or other firearm at any other person.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThe Superior Court, being equally divided, affirmed appellant\u2019s conviction for violation of Section 716. Commonwealth v. Lowary, 226 Pa.Super. 115, 313 A.2d 317 (1973). Judge Spaeth wrote an opinion in support of reversal which was joined by Judge Hoffman and Judge Cercone. In his opinion Judge Spaeth said:\n\u201cIt may be granted that a B-B gun is a \u2018gun\u2019, and may be (and in the present case was) a \u2018pistol\u2019, but that is beside the point. The statute proscribes pointing \u2018a gun, pistol, or other firearm . . . .\u2019 Accordingly, it is not a crime to point a B-B gun unless it is a \u2018firearm\u2019. This is so as a matter of grammar; \u2018other\u2019 modifies \u2018gun\u2019 and \u2018pistol\u2019. It is also so as a matter of legal precedent, as may be seen from Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Comm., 119 Pa.Super. 292, 181 A. 73 (1935). There, the statute required approval of a \u2018transaction involving] . . . the assumption of any obligation or liability, whether as guarantor, endorser, or otherwise . . . .\u2019 Citing \u2018the general rule, that words of a general import are limited by words of restricted import immediately following and relating to the same subject, 59 C.J. 980\u2019, id. at 297, 181 A. at 75, this court held that \u2018by the use of the language, \u201cwhether as guarantor, endorser, or otherwise,\u201d the Legislature modified and restricted the import of the word \u201cassumption,\u201d to transactions of secondary liability.\u2019 Id. So here: By the use of words of \u2018restricted import\u2019, i. e., \u2018or other firearm\u2019, the legislature \u2018modified and restricted the import\u2019 of the preceding words of \u2018general import\u2019, i. e., \u2018gun, pistol\u2019.\n\u201cThe question, therefore, is not whether appellant pointed a B-B gun that was a \u2018gun\u2019 or \u2018pistol\u2019 but whether he pointed a B-B gun that was a \u2018firearm\u2019, and the answer is that he did not, because a B-B gun is not, and cannot be, a \u2018firearm\u2019. The statute does not define \u2018firearm\u2019. (Footnote omitted.) When a statute does not define a word, the word is to be understood according to its \u2018common and approved usage\u2019. 1 Pa. S. \u00a7 1903 (a). The common and approved usage of \u2018firearm\u2019 is \u2018a weapon from which a shot is discharged by gunpowder.\u2019 Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary 854 (1961).\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Lowary, 226 Pa.Super. 115, 116-17, 313 A.2d 317, 318 (1973) (Spaeth, J., in support of reversal) .\nWe agree with the above portion of Judge Spaeth\u2019s opinion. We know, however, that the definition of firearm may not be necessarily limited to those weapons from which a shot is dispersed by gunpowder alone. Weapons using some propellant other than gunpowder might also be properly classified as a firearm. Those activated by mechanical means such as springs, however, are not firearms within the statute.\nJudgment of sentence reversed.\nJONES, C. J., and POMEROY and NIX, JJ., concur in the result."}
