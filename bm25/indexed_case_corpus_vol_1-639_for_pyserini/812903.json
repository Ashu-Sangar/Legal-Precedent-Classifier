{"id": "812903", "contents": "Opinion,\nMe. Chief Justice Paxson :\nIf the appellant had supported her claims before the auditor by competent proof, we would have had the question before us whether the presentation of said claims before a previous auditor in the same estate, without an adjudication thereon, tolls the statute of limitations. The auditor rejected her claims as insufficiently proved,' in which he was sustained by the court below. It requires a strong case\u2014a palpable error\u2014to justify us in reversing both the court and the auditor upon a question of fact.\nWe are unable to see any grounds of reversal in this case. The Baney claim of $500, referred to in the third assignment, was not supported by so much as a scintilla of proof. The documentary evidence relied on to establish it, was offered but not admitted, because not proved. So much of Mr. Fox\u2019s testimony as bore upon the claim was hearsay. The auditor was right in holding there was no legal evidence in support of it.\nNor are we prepared to say tliat there was error in rejecting the claim of the appellant referred to in the second assignment. It may be, as stated in \u00b0the argument of ber learned counsel, that it \u201c was as fully proved as the nature of the case admitted.\u201d It was a very old claim, and we can readily understand bow such a claim is more difficult of proof than one of recent origin. But we cannot apply a more lenient rule to a claim because it is stale; on the contrary, such claims require additional caution, and tbe rules of evidence should not be relaxed in tlieir favor. It is quite as easy to establish an old claim against a dead man\u2019s estate as it is to defeat it.\nThe decree is affirmed, and tbe appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
