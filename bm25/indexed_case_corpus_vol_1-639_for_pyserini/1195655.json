{"id": "1195655", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nPlaintiff brought an action in trespass against defendant for the death of her son, Michael Vescio.\nDefendant produces and distributes electric current for light and power, and as part of its business maintains and operates a transforming sub-station at Warren, Pa. The entire premises of this sub-station are enclosed by a high wire fence, and entrance to the premises is only through a small building. Within the enclosure there are transformers and wires, with structures supporting them.\nOn the morning of November 8, 1936, P. J. Crowley, defendant\u2019s employee, was in charge of this sub-station. While two other employees of defendant, Smith and Schaffer, were engaged in making repairs to the steel structure and were mounted thereon, Smith in some manner came in contact with a \u201clive\u201d wire, which burned him, rendered him incapable of helping himself, and as a result he was thrown across the girder and wiring, and his clothes ignited. Crowley shut off all the power and, with Schaffer\u2019s help, put out the fire. Crowley, realizing that he and Schaffer would not be able to get Smith down, looked out toward the public highway, saw Michael Vescio, plaintiff\u2019s decedent, age 21, and some others on the sidewalk outside the fence, and asked that some of them come into the station to help him. Vescio and a few others responded. Crowley procured a ladder and Vescio climbed it to get to the wires to help Smith. Crowley testified: \u201cI got to the switchboard\u201d and \u201cshut off all the incoming power, to the best of my knowledge.\u201d Having done this, Crowley thought that all the lines were dead. After Vescio helped to tie a knot in a rope around Smith\u2019s body, preparatory to lowering the latter to the ground, he stepped back and encountered a \u201clive\u201d wire of high voltage, which resulted in his death.\nAs Vescio was unmarried, his mother instituted this action against defendant. The latter filed an affidavit of defense in the nature of a demurrer, setting up, inter alia, that defendant \u201cat the time he received the injury which caused his death was acting in the course of his employment as a temporary emergency employee of the defendant, and, therefore, the only liability of the defendant would be under-the Workmen\u2019s Compensation laws\u201d of this state. The demurrer was overruled. The jury rendered a verdict for plaintiff in the sum of $10,000. Defendant\u2019s motions for judgment n. o. v. and for a new trial were overruled and judgment was thereupon entered on the verdict. This appeal followed.\nThe first proposition of the appellant is that the deceased was an employee within the protection of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and that therefore an action for his wrongful death did not lie. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, excepts from its provisions those persons whose employment is \u201ccasual in character and not in the regular course of the business of the employer.\u201d In Blake v. Wilson, 268 Pa. 469, 112 A. 126, this court held that where a woman owning and operating a farm and engaged in no other business, employs a school teacher, during the temporary suspension of his school, to roof and paint a silo, the construction of which had been suspended for some time, and such employee is killed while at work on the silo, the accident is \u201ccasual in character and not in the regular course of the business of the employer,\u201d within the meaning of section 104 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 2,1915, P. L. 736. In Justice Stewart\u2019s opinion in that case he said: \u201cThe one rule which the court is allowed to apply in such case is limited to a consideration of the objects of the enactment, its purpose, and the appropriateness of the language used to the supposed purpose, in view of the legislature. . . . All will agree that its primary and general purpose was to substitute a method of accident insurance in place of common law rights and liabilities for substantially all employees, except such as are by express terms or necessary implication excluded from its operation.\u201d Justice Stewart held that the two conditions, i.e., the casual employment and employment not in the regular course of the employer\u2019s business, must concur to constitute the exception. He said that the character of employment in that case \u201cmay well be regarded as casual considering . . . that it was out of the line of his regular employment. . . . An employee\u2019s engagement is casual in character when it comes about by chance, fortuitously, and for no fixed duration of time.\u201d In considering the question, was the employment in the regular course of the employer\u2019s business, he said: \u201cThe regular course of the business can only refer to the experience and custom in the conduct of the business as is of usual, if not daily, occurrence and observation.\u201d He also said: \u201cThe word \u2018regular,\u2019 as it is used in the statute, does not qualify the word \u2018business\u2019 but the course of the conduct of that business.\u201d He cited the case of Maryland Casualty Co. v. Pillsbury, 172 Cal. 748. There a machinist was employed by a farmer* merely to repair a tractor, and it was held that the repairing of the tractor was not in the usual course of the occupation of the farmer.\nIn Passarelli v. Monacelli, 121 Pa. Superior Ct. 32,183 A. 65, that court held that \u201cworkmen are engaged in casual employment when they are employed only occasionally, irregularly or incidentally as distinguished from those employed regularly and continuously. . . . The words \u2018regular course of business of the employer\u2019 have reference to the habitual or regular occupation that the party is engaged in with a view of winning a livelihood or some gain: Blake v. Wilson, 268 Pa. 469, 112 A. 126, and the most natural meaning is that they refer to the normal operations which regularly constitute the business in question, excluding incidental or occasional operations arising out of the transaction of that business, such as, now and again repairing the premises, appliances or machinery used therein.\u201d In Sgattone v. Mulholland & Gotwals, Inc., 290 Pa. 341, 347, 138 A. 855, this court said: \u201cWhen the employment is by chance, without fixed duration of time, it may be said to be casual, but, even if so, the master is responsible if the work was in the regular course of his business, by which is meant during the normal operations which constitute it [citing cases].\u201d The question whether on the facts found an employment was casual in character or in the regular business of the employer within the meaning of the act, is one of law: Callihan v. Montgomery, 272 Pa. 56, 115 A. 889, and Boyd v. Philmont Country Club, 129 Pa. Superior Ct. 135.\nIn the case at bar the employment of the deceased was clearly casual in character, as that phrase has been interpreted by the appellate courts. It was also not in the regular course of the defendant\u2019s business but under an abnormal, unexpected and accidental circumstance, which cannot be properly regarded as being \u201cin the regular course of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d Defendant\u2019s regular course of business is the generation, transmission and sale of electric current. It is not in the business of removing injured workmen from perilous situations and starting them on the way to medical or other necessary attentions. There is nothing in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act to bar this action of tort.\nThe next proposition of appellant is that the plaintiff failed to make out an actionable case. In Janock v. B. & O. R. R. Co., 252 Pa. 199, 97 A. 205, this court said: \u201cGranting the burden was on plaintiff to furnish evidence of negligence beyond the mere fact of the happening of the accident, it is not, however, necessary in all cases to prove negligence by positive evidence. There are many instances where the burden resting on plaintiff may be met by proof of circumstances from which the jury are permitted to infer negligence on the part of defendant.\u201d In Maerkle v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., 311 Pa. 517, 165 A. 503, we said: \u201cIn Shafer v. Lacock Hawthorn & Co., 168 Pa. 497, 504, 32 A. 44, this court quoted approvingly from Sherman & Redfield on Negligence, sections 59 and 60, as follows: \u2018The accident, the injury and the circumstances under which they occurred are in some cases sufficient to raise a presumption of negligence and thus cast on the defendant the burden of establishing his freedom from fault. When the thing which causes the injury is shown to be under the management of the defendants and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants that the accident arose from a want of care.\u2019 \u201d To the same effect is Maltz v. Carter, 311 Pa. 550, and Gawronski v. McAdoo, 266 Pa. 449. In MacDougall v. Penna. Power & Light Co., 311 Pa. 387, 166 A. 589, we said: \u201c \u2018A higher degree of care and vigilance is required in dealing with a dangerous agency [in that case electricity] than in the ordinary affairs of life or business, which involves little or no risk of injury to persons or property\u2019: 20 R.C.L. sec. 47, page 5.\u201d\nWhile in the case at bar there is testimony that the current was \u201cshut off,\u201d the fact remains that Michael Yescio, while on defendant\u2019s premises by invitation, received through his body an electric current of sufficient voltage to cause his death. If the current had been completely \u201cshut off,\u201d as under the circumstances it should have been, this accident would not have occurred. If the switches which Crowley testified he opened at the time in question were in fact open and if the switchboard itself was not defective, it is a legitimate inference that the wire which deceased came in contact with would not have carried a charge of electricity. Crowley\u2019s testimony as to shutting off the current by throwing the switch was corroborated by witness J. R. Campbell, who was the operating engineer at the plant. He testified that Crowley \u201copened up all the switches on the different circuits.\u201d He was asked: \u201cDid that cut off the electricity where this body [i.e., Smith\u2019s] was?\u201d He answered: \u201cIt did.\u201d He said that Crowley \u201copened the controls of the switchboard, what we call cleaning house, every switch up through it.\u201d Arnold Scheaffer, another witness, testified that on the morning of the accident and before it took place, he was ordered to Avork on the switchboard, that he and Smith (who'was fatally injured just before Yescio came in contact with the \u201clive\u201d wire) started to work about 8 a. m. He said that he \u201cfound some bushings which were dirty\u201d and that he \u201cwent to clean those.\u201d He also said that he was working on a particular switch which \u201cwas out of adjustment and did not malee proper contact.\u201d It was a little later after he and Smith had worked on these switches that Smith, who \u201chad noticed some bolts out on the steel structure on the tubing that was isolated,\u201d \u201cstarted to crawl\u201d up about fourteen feet on the structure \u201cto get over there to replace bolts.\u201d (It was there that Smith, according to this witness, \u201clost his balance\u201d and \u201cgot too near the \u2018live\u2019 circuit,\u201d and was fatally burned.) From this testimony that there was something defective in the switchboard that morning, though Scheaffer testified that he and Smith \u201ctightened up the switch and adjusted the contacts,\u201d and from all the other testimony in the case, and in the absence of exculpatory evidence, the happening of this fatal accident to Vescio presented a case for submission to the jury and supports a verdict in favor of the plaintiff.\nAppellant bases an assignment of error upon the court\u2019s permitting Dr. Cashman, a witness called by the plaintiff, to repeat the conversation between himself and workman Smith, who, upon being taken to the hospital, made statements to the doctor that he thought the current had been shut off but that it was not shut off until after Vescio was electrocuted. At this time Smith was described as being in severe agony and pain, \u201cmorphine in large doses was given and he talked incessantly about his pain and about the fact that he thought the current was shut off.\u201d Appellant maintains that \u201cthis testimony was inadmissible because it was hearsay, and was definitely not res gestae because it lacked the spontaneity required to bring that within the exception to the hearsay rule, and would not be binding upon the defendant in any event.\u201d This testimony would not be inadmissible simply because it was made by some one other than Vescio. \u201cThat nervous excitement which renders an utterance admissible may exist equally for a mere bystander as well as for the injured or injuring person, and therefore the utterances of either, concerning what they observed, are equally admissible\u201d: Wigmore on Evidence, 2nd ed., Yol. 3, sec. 1755. However, on account of the lapse of time between the accident to Smith and his statement about it, it is doubtful if his statement, even though apparently a spontaneous one, can be regarded as part of the res; gestae. See Com. v. Fugmann, 330 Pa. 4, 17, 198 A. 99. It is not necessary to decide this, for assuming this testimony was improperly admitted, it was not prejudicial to the defendant since there was no substantial dispute about the fact that those involved in this accident thought the current was turned off or about the fact that the wire which Yeseio came in contact with was a \u201clive\u201d one.\nAppellant complains that the verdict of $10,000 is excessive. The testimony showed that on November 8, 1936, the date of Veseio\u2019s death, he was between 21 and 22 years of age and that he was unmarried. He supported his mother with weekly contributions ranging from $10 to $15, which included payments for his room and board on those occasions when he was at home. When he worked away from his mother\u2019s home, he made the same contributions to her. He also bought her considerable household equipment such as an electric iron and washer, and he provided her with coal. He also paid the interest on a mortgage of $1500 on his mother\u2019s property and occasionally paid something on the principal. He also paid the taxes. The mother received no support from her husband who had deserted her and \u201cwent back to the old country\u201d ten years previously. The undertaker\u2019s expenses in this case were $543.50 and the burial expenses $56.70, making a total of $600.20. As to decedent\u2019s earnings, it was shown that when he worked for the General Electric Company in Erie, they ranged from $25.00 to $30.00 per week. It was testified that he was the only person contributing to his mother\u2019s support aud that he had promised her that he would never get married as long as she lived, so that he could take care of her. The mother at the time of her son\u2019s death was 58 years of age.\nIt was the duty of the jury to consider, in arriving at a verdict in this case, the age of the mother, how long she would be likely to live, and whether or not her son would continue to support her during her life\u2019s duration. It also had the right to consider the probability that he might marry and thereby diminish his ability to support his mother. In estimating what amount the mother would lose in future contributions from her son, it was the duty of the jury to reduce this to its \u201cpresent worth,\u201d i.e., to a sum which if paid on the date of the verdict would then be a just cash equivalent of the sum total of such lost future contributions. See Littman v. Bell Telephone Co., 315 Pa. 370, 377, 172 A. 687.\nUnder the evidence, our conclusion is, applying the tests laid down by law for measuring damages in cases of this character (see Gay dos et al. v. Domabyl, 301 Pa. 523, 152 A. 549), an award in excess of $6,600 cannot be sustained.\nThe judgment of the court below is reduced to $6,600 and, as modified, is affirmed."}
