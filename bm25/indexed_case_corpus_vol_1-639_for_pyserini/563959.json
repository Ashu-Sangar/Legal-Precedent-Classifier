{"id": "563959", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThe question here is whether the agreement of December 10, 1885, is a conditional sale or a bailment. The learned \u2022 court below ruled that it was a bailment, and we see no error in this. The case comes distinctly within Rowe v. Sharp, 51 Pa. 26, and Enlow v. Klein, 79 Pa. 488, and that line of cases.\nJudgment affirmed."}
