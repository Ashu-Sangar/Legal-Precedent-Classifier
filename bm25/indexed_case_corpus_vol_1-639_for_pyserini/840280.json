{"id": "840280", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nIf the jury\u2019s attention was not called to all the questions of law involved in this case, it was not the fault of learned counsel on either side. It appears that forty-two points for charge \u2014fourteen by plaintiff and twice that number by defendant\u2014 were presented and fully answered by the learned president of the court. In the main, his answers appear to have been satisfactory to both parties, for tbe only subjects of complaint here are bis refusal to affirm defendant\u2019s nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-third and twenty-eighth points, respectively, as presented. In the latter he was requested to charge: \u201c Under all the evidence in this case the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant.\u201d This he very properly refused to do, for the very good reason that the evidence tended strongly to show that defendant\u2019s negligence caused the injury complained of, and there was no admitted or undisputed fact or facts in the case that would have justified him in declaring, as matter of law, that plaintiff was guilty of any negligence that contributed to her injury. An examination of the somewhat voluminous testimony shows that defendant\u2019s liability depended on questions of fact which were clearly for the consideration and determination of the jury. These questions were fairly submitted to them in a very clear and comprehensive charge, which appears to be free from error.\nFor reasons above suggested, there was no error in the learned judge\u2019s answers to either of the points recited in the first three specifications, in which he was substantially requested to say that, under certain facts and circumstances therein stated, the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence and could not recover. The facts and circumstances, of which these points are respectively predicated, were neither admitted nor established by undisputed evidence, and hence it would have been manifest error to have affirmed them without qualification.\nReferring to the twentieth point, the learned judge said, in substance: If this means to ask us to say, as matter of law, that it was physically impossible for plaintiff not to have seen the train approaching the crossing, we cannot affirm it. \u201c If it means, \u2014 and we so understand it to mean, \u2014 that if you find that it was a physical impossibility for her not to see this train moving, if she looked, we think the point is well taken. As we read the point, we think it asks us to say that it is shown by the undisputed testimony that it was a physical impossibility, and we decline to say that. That is a matter for you and not for the court.\u201d This was clearly correct.\nThere is nothing in the undisputed facts of this case, as they appear from the testimony, to bring it within the principle of Carroll v. Railroad Co., 2 Penny. 159, and that line of cases.\nNeither of the specifications of error is sustained.\nJudgment affirmed."}
