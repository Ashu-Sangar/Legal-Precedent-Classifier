{"id": "1275642", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nThis appeal presents a solitary issue: in the absence of any docket entry in the Register of Wills\u2019 office evidencing a final inheritance tax appraisement by the Commonwealth, is the statutory 60 day period for an appeal from the appraisement tolled?\nHugh O. Jones, a resident of Mercer County, died March 4, 1950. Letters testamentary in his estate were issued to the First National Bank of Sharon, Pa., and C. B. Lartz.\nOn May 14, 1951 the executors filed an inventory and appraisement listing real estate valued at $34,750, personalty valued at $18,578.61, or a total of $53,328.61. In supplement thereto, on July 24, 1951 the executors filed another statement of assets showing realty valued at $49,600, personalty valued at $18,580.61, or a total of $68,180.61. In further supplement thereto, on July 26, 1952, the executors filed another statement of assets showing realty valued at $35,250, personalty valued at $18,580.61, or a total of $53,830.61. On the same day another supplemental statement of assets was filed listing other real estate valued at $2,250.\nPrior to July 26, 1952, the executors filed the required reports with the inheritance tax officials listing real estate valued at $36,850, personalty valued at $18,578.61, or a total value of $55,428.61, and claiming deductions in the amount of $19,298.12.\nOn July 26, 1952 the Commonwealth\u2019s inheritance tax appraiser appraised the estate\u2019s assets. In this appraisement the taxing authorities accepted the value of the personalty and the deductions as listed and claimed by the estate; however, the real estate was appraised at $47,000 \u2014 an increase over the estate\u2019s value of $36,-850 \u2014 resulting in an increase in the amount of inheritanee tax over and above that acknowledged by and paid, at least in part, by the estate.\nNo appeal was ever taken from this appraisement and the assessment of the taw by the Commonwealth.\nThe Commonwealth maintains that on July 26, 1952 a final tax appraisement was filed in the Register of Wills\u2019 office; that on August 18, 1952 the attorney for the estate was duly notified of the filing of this appraisement; that again on September 10, 1952 the attorney was notified not only of this filing but also of the finality of this appraisement. Appellant (surviving executor of the estate) contends that even though the appraisement may have been, in the Register of Wills\u2019 files on July 26, 1952, the docket entries therein do not show the filing of any such appraisement and, in the absence of any such docket entry, an appeal could not be perfected from the appraisement.\nOn April 5, 1956 the Commonwealth presented a petition in the court below to enforce payment of the unpaid inheritance tax. After an answer and supplemental answer were filed on behalf of the estate, and, after hearing, the court below granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition and directed payment of the inheritance tax calculated on the basis of the final appraisement filed on July 26, 1952.\nSection 18 of the taxing statute, as amended, provides, inter alia: \u201cAny person not satisfied with any appraisement of the property of a resident decedent may appeal, within sixty days, to the orphans\u2019 court, on paying or giving security to pay all costs, together with whatever tax shall be fixed by the court. . .\u201d.\nAppellant argues that the 60 day period provided in this statute begins to run when and only when an appraisement is formally entered on the docket of the Register of Wills and that, absent such entry, no appeal will lie. Appellant, conceding that there is no specific statutory requirement that the tax appraiser file his return with the Register of Wills, relies upon Section 14 of the taxing statute, as amended, supra (72 PS \u00a72341), and Section 13 of the Register of Wills Act, to support its contention that such a return must be filed and docketed by the Register of Wills.\nSection 14 of the taxing statute, supra, provides: \u201cThe register of wills shall enter in a book, to be provided at the expense of the Commonwealth, which shall be a public record, the returns made by all appraisers appointed by him under the provisions of this act, opening an account in favor of the Commonwealth against each decedent\u2019s estate. The register may give certificates of payment of such tax from such record. The register shall transmit to the Auditor General, on the first day of each month, a statement of all returns made by appraisers during the preceding month, upon which the taxes have been paid or remain unpaid, which statement shall be entered by the Auditor General in a book to be kept for the purpose.\u201d Neither in this statute nor in its predecessor is any specific provision made for any notice of the appraisement to be given to the taxpayer.\nThe purpose of Section 14, supra, is two-fold: (1) to provide a method of correlating the records of paid and unpaid inheritance taxes between the offices of Registers of Wills and the Auditor General, and (2), possibly, to provide a method for public notice of paid and unpaid inheritance taxes. Section 14 is clearly inapplicable to the instant situation. In the first place, the section contemplates the recordation of the appraisers\u2019 returns after and not before settlement of the tax. In the second place, the public notice which arises from recordation of the returns for taxes is clearly insufficient as to a taxpayer as distinguished from the public generally. This Court has unequivocally held that notice to the taxpayer must be actual and specific and that \u201cnotice of the filing of the appraisement is necessarily implied in the right of appeal given by the statute [Act of 1887, supra], and the thirty days\u2019 limitation of the right begin only from such noticeBelcher\u2019s Estate, 211 Pa. 615, 618, 61 A. 252. See also: Handley Estate, 181 Pa. 339, 348, 37 A. 587. Had the Register complied in all respects with Section 14, supra, and docketed the appraiser\u2019s return, such docketing would not be equivalent to the notice which our courts require be given by the Commonwealth to the taxpayer.\nSection 13 of the Act of 1917, supra, provides: \u201cIt shall be the duty of the registers of wills of the several counties of this Commonwealth to record all inventories and appraisements of the estate of any decedent, filed in the office of the register of wills by the executor or administrator of any such decedent\u2019s estate, in a book to be provided for that purpose; and the same shall be indexed by such register of wills in an index book provided for that purpose; . . . .\u201d Section 502 of the Register of Wills Act of 1951 provides: \u201cThe register shall index and record all inventories and appraisements filed with him. . . .\u201d Obviously, the \u201cinventories and appraisements\u201d referred to in both statutory provisions are the \u201cinventories and appraisements\u201d required to be filed by a personal representative under the Fiduciaries Act of 1917, \u00a7442 (Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, \u00a7lla, 20 PS chap. 3, App. \u00a7442) or its successor (the Fiduciaries Act of April 18, 1949, P. L. 512, art. IV, \u00a7401, 20 PS \u00a7320.401) and not the appraisements made by the Commonwealth for inheritance tax purposes. Both provisions are clearly inapposite.\nAn examination of the record indicates that the Commonwealth filed its tax appraisement on July 26, 1952 and the appraisement bears the notation \u201cFiled in the Register\u2019s Office, July 26, 1952.\u201d The record of appraisement which contains this notation is a public record. It is entitled, therefore, to the benefit of the well-established presumption that public records are valid and correct and that the official acts involved in their preparation have been properly performed: Cameron Estate, 388 Pa. 25, 37, 130 A. 2d 173; Tremont Township School District Appeal, 366 Pa. 404, 409, 77 A. 2d 403; Fleming et al. v. Adamson et al., 321 Pa. 28, 37, 182 A. 518, 522; Vernon Township et al. v. United Natural Gas Co., 256 Pa. 435, 439, 100 A. 1007.\nOn August 18, 1952 the Register of Wills gave written notice (a form) to the attorney for the estate that the inheritance tax appraisement had been filed on July 26, 1952 showing an appraised value of the realty at $47,000, of the personalty at $18,578.61, and a total appraised value of $65,578.61. This notice' further stated that a tax was due the Commonwealth in the amount of $2,338.34 and the attorney\u2019s attention was directed to the statutory provision providing for an appeal therefrom. The Commonwealth introduced in evidence the original tax record card in the Register of Wills\u2019 office (prepared after an appraisal is final and after the forms of notice are sent out), which indicates the filing of the inheritance tax appraisement on July 26, 1952 and the mailing of notices on August 18, 1952. The record also discloses a letter addressed by the attorney for the estate to the \u201cState Inheritance Tax Appraiser for Mercer County\u201d in which the attorney, acknowledging receipt of a copy of a letter which the tax appraiser had received from Harrisburg wherein the Commonwealth proposed to increase the appraisal, not only specifically referred to the proposed appraisals on each property, but also inquired: \u201cIf there has been a formal reappraisal made of these properties, please advise me, as we will file an appeal from the suggested amount. If the appraisal is a statement in a tentative form then I would like to submit the following information.\u201d In the same letter the attorney inquired: \u201cPlease let me know when the appraisal was finally made so that we may file the necessary appeal.\u201d In reply to this letter the tax appraiser on September 10, 1952 advised the attorney, in writing, as follows: \u201cIn reply to your letter of August 23rd, concerning the reappraisal of properties in the above estate the reappraisal is definite and final as far as this Office is concerned\u201d (Emphasis supplied) An examination of this correspondence clearly indicates tliat the \u00e1ttorney for the estate was unequivocally advised of the finality of the appraisement on September 10, 1952.\nIt is abundantly clear that a final appraisement of decedent\u2019s estate by the Commonwealth was made and filed in the Register of Wills\u2019 office on July 26, 1952, that notice of the filing of this appraisement was duly given, in writing, both by the Register of Wills and by the Commonwealth to the estate\u2019s attorney, and that on September 10, 1952 the attorney was made fully aware of the finality of such appraisement. Appellant\u2019s failure to take and perfect an appeal within 60 days of the time-of such notice bars it from an appeal from the appraisement. It is well established that when a taxpayer fails to take his appeal within the statutory period, the appraisement becomes final and binding: Reynolds Estate, 359 Pa. 616, 60 A. 2d 57; Darsie Estate, 354 Pa. 540, 47 A. 2d 815.\nOrder affirmed.\nThis appraisal is not presently in issue.\nThe testimony indicates that under the practice in the Mercer County Register\u2019s office no entry as to taxation was made on the docket until the tax was fully paid.\nAct of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521, art. II, \u00a713; Act of June 22, 1931, P. L. 689, \u00a71; Act of July 15, 1935, P. L. 1028, \u00a71; Act of May 27, 1943, P. L. 757, \u00a73; 72 PS \u00a72327.\nAct of June 7, 1917, P. A 415, \u00a713, 20 PS \u00a71941, repealed by Act of June 28, 1951, P. A 638, art. VI, \u00a7601.\nIt is to be noted that originally the tax appraisers were appointed by the Register of Wills but are now appointed by the Secretary of Revenue: Act of May 4, 1927, P. A 727, \u00a72: Act of May 21, 1943, P. A 370, \u00a71; 72 PS \u00a72325.\nAct of May 6, 1887, P. A 79, \u00a712.\nFor instance, such a recordation of the payment or non-payment of these taxes is most important to a title or lien searcher. Of: Act of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343, art. VII, \u00a7724 ; 72 PS \u00a7724.\nThis Act was in effect when decedent died.\nAct of June 28, 1951, P. L. 638, art. V, \u00a7502, 20 PS \u00a71840.502. This Act was in effect when the appraisement was made and filed. Comment under this section of the Act is significant: \u201cThis is suggested by Section 13 of the 1917 Act.\u201d\nSee: Webster\u2019s Estate, 314 Pa. 233, 235, 171 A. 568."}
