{"id": "502682", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered February 5th 1884.\nPer Curiam.\n\u2014 In this distribution the appellant claims under an alleged mechanics\u2019 lien for repairs, alterations and additions to the buildings sold at sheriff\u2019s sale. The Act of August 1st 1868, Pur. Dig. 1028, pi. 21, applicable to such claims in the city of Philadelphia, expressly declares they shall not be a lien \u201c except from the time of filing the claim.\u2019\u2019 The appellants\u2019 claim was not filed in the lifetime of the owner of the building. When he died it was not of record, and no lien by virtue of the Act cited. By 1ns death it became a lien lik\u00e9 other debts of his, not of record. It was then of no higher grade. It had no preference over any other of his debts. The filing of the claim after-wards gave no preference. The claim which under the Act of 1861 was no lien until filed, could not create a lien which would relate back of the filing whether the owner of the building was living or dead, when it was filed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants."}
