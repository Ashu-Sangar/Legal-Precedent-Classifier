{"id": "454231", "contents": "Mr. Justice Sterrett\ndelivered the opinion of the court November 10, 1884.\n' It was incumbent on the plaintiff below to prove that he was entitled to a seat in the car on which he was travelling at the time he was forcibly removed therefrom; and, that the conductor, who was in charge'of the train and by whom he was ejected from the car, was then an employee of the Penn-' sylvania Railroad Company, acting within the general scope of his authority as such conductor. If these facts were established to the satisfaction of the juiy, and nothing was shown to justify the action of the conductor, it necessarily followed that a trespass was committed for which the company was liable in damages;' and, under proper instructions by the court as to the measure of damages, it was the exclusive province of the jury to determine the amount thereof, subject of course to the power of the court to set aside the verdict in case.the damages awarded were clearly excessive and the plaintiff 'below refused to remit such excess. In view of the testimony, 'th\u00e9 \u2022 damages in this case appear to us to be \u00e9xorbitant ; but, 'we have no right to grant relief on that ground alone; The power to do so was exclusively in the court below, and its refusal to exercise the discretion with which it was invested is not the subject of review here.\nFor the purpose of showing his right to travel on the train from which he was ejected, the plaintiff below gave in evidence a ticket of which the following is a copy:\nPennsylvania Railroad Company. This excursion ticket entitles the bearer to one trip to Philadelphia, Pa., and return. This ticket is void unless officially stamped and dated. In selling tliis ticket over other roads this company acts only as an agent, and assumes no responsibility beyond its own line.\n. . . . . The checks belonging to this ticket will be void if detached.\u201d\nAttached to the ticket is a cheek as follows, viz.: \u201c Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Phila. & Erie R. R. Div. One first-class passage, Sunbury to Williamsport. This cheek is not good if detached. Philadelphia, Pa., and return.\u201d Also another cheek which reads as follows : \u201c Issued by Pennsylvania Railroad Company, on account of Northern Central Railroad. One first-class passage, Harrisburg to Sunbury. This check is not good if detached. Philadelphia, Pa., and return.\u201d Stamped on the back of the ticket is the following, viz.: \u201c Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 237, Passenger Department, Pennsylvania R. R. Office, Aug. 22, Williamsport.\u201d\nThe ticket, of which the foregoing is substantially a copy, was purchased by plaintiff below in 1879, on the day it bears date, at the company\u2019s office in Williamsport, and immediately used by him iii travelling thence to Philadelphia. The going cheeks were used in making that trip. Having the ticket with return checks still attached thereto in his possession, he left Philadelphia in November, 1881, intending to use the same iii going thence to Williamsport. He experienced no difficulty until lie reached a point on the Northern Central Railroad east of Dauphin, where he offered the ticket for passage to Sunbury and thence to Williamsport, but the conductor refused, to receive it, on the ground that the time within which it might have been used had expired, and insisted on payment of the usual fare. That demand not having been complied with, the train, after making its usual stop at Dauphin, was again stopped some distance north of the station and plaintiff below was ejected therefrom for non-payment of fare.\nThere is nothing on the face of the ticket to indicate that it was limited as to time, nor was there any competent evidence, dehors the ticket, to prove any such limitation and notice thereof to plaintiff below. The offer to prove that prior to the sale of the ticket in 1879, public notice was given, at the place where it was purchased, that such tickets were \u201c sold from June 1st to October 1st, good to return until November 1st,\u201d of that year, and that similar notice was given by circulars there and elsewhere, was clearly incompetent and rightly rejected. If the proposition had been coupled with an offer to show that the plaintiff below had actual notice of the fact, it would have been competent, but this was not doue, nor was there any testimony in the case tending to prove that he knew the ticket was limited. The learned judge was therefore right in charging the jury that there is nothing whatever on the ticket limiting the time within which it might be used; nor is there anything to show the purchaser \u201c that it was not at his discretion to use it when he was disposed to do so, and the company cannot limit their responsibility, after making a contract of that sort, by any directions or instructions to their agents.\u201d He was also right in refusing to charge as requested in defendant\u2019s second point, viz.: \u201c If the jury believe that the plaintiff, by the exercise of ordinary diligence and care in making iiiquiries, could have ascertained \u2019 at or before the time he got the ticket, that under the rules and regulations of the company it was not good after November 1st, 1879, and did not exercise such care and diligence, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, and the verdict should be for defendant.\u201d There was no evidence to justify the submission of this proposition. On the contrary the uncontradicted testimony negatived the idea of any want of care and diligence on the part of plaintiff below. He testified in substance that when he was about purchasing a single ticket to Philadelphia, the ticket agent informed him he could buy a round trip ticket that would be good until used, and upon that assurance he bought and paid for the ticket in question.\nThere is nothing, either in the testimony admitted or in the offers of evidence, that tended in the slightest degree to invalidate the ticket in the hands of plaintiff below, and hence he was entitled to use it at the time it was tendered to the conductor, and the latter had no fight to eject him from the car for non-payment of fare.\nThe next question is, whether the learned judge erred in refusing defendant\u2019s first point and in submitting to the jury the question whether the conductor in charge of the train was an employee of the defendant below, then acting within the general scope of his authority as such conductor. The provision, contained in the ticket, that in selling it \u201c for passage over other roads, this company acts only as an agent and assumes no responsibility beyond its own line,\u201d of course relieves it from liability for any wrong done on the line of the Northern Central Railroad, unless the act complained of was committed by one of the company defendant\u2019s own officers or employees acting within the general scope of his authority at the time. As to this, the testimony was conflicting, but it was clearly proper for the consideration of the jury, and was fairly submitted to them. They must have found the fact as claimed by the plaintiff below, otherwise their verdict, under the instructions of the court, would have been in favor of the company.\nThere was no error in declining to affirm defendant\u2019s third, point; nor in rejecting the offer referred to in the sixth specification. Neither of the assignments of error is sustained.\nJudgment affirmed.\nJustices Paxson and Green dissent, upon the ground that the-re was no evidence that the conductor was in the employ of the defendant company.\n[A motion for a re-argument of the above case was refused.]"}
