{"id": "1776265", "contents": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nAt approximately 2:30 a. m. on February 14, 1976, appellee James Vincent Sandutch, James Vincent Mastrota and Henry Mangum drove to the home of Luzerne County Deputy Sheriff Eugene Boyarski, where appellee and Mastrota threw a firebomb \u2014 a half-gallon milk bottle filled with gasoline \u2014 through a window, setting the house ablaze and killing Deputy and Mrs. Boyarski and their three children.\nAs a result of this incident, on November 5,1976 appellee was convicted by a jury of five counts of murder of the second degree, one count of arson and one count of criminal conspiracy. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellee was sentenced to two consecutive and three concurrent terms of life imprisonment for murder, and a consecutive term of imprisonment of seven and one-half to fifteen years for. arson; appellee\u2019s sentence on the conspiracy conviction was suspended.\nA three-judge panel of the Superior Court reversed appellee\u2019s judgment of sentence and remanded the case for a new trial. Commonwealth v. Sandutch, 269 Pa.Super. 481, 410 A.2d 358 (1979). We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s contention on this appeal is that the trial court was correct in excluding from evidence both a tape recording allegedly made by James Vincent Mastrota and verified pretrial applications filed by Mastrota in his own case, and that the three-judge panel erred in concluding to the contrary. We agree.\nThe facts leading up to these disputed evidentiary rulings are as follows. On May 18, 1976, Mastrota testified at appellee\u2019s preliminary hearing and implicated both himself and appellee in a premeditated plan to firebomb the home of Deputy Boyarski. When Mastrota refused to testify at appellee\u2019s trial on the grounds that any such testimony would incriminate him, the Commonwealth was permitted to play for the jury a tape recording of Mastrota\u2019s testimony at the preliminary hearing.\nAfter the Commonwealth had completed the presentation of its case, appellee attempted to play for the jury a second tape, allegedly made by Mastrota. According to appellee\u2019s offer of proof at trial, \u201cthe content of the tape is a complete, unequivocal repudiation of any incriminating evidence that he [Mastrota] previously supplied anyone, and it contains statements made, we contend, by James Mastrota.\u201d Appellee sought to play the tape \u201csolely for the purpose of attacking the tape recording testimony introduced into evidence by the Commonwealth . ... \u201d\nAppellee also sought to impeach the credibility of Mastrota\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony by attempting to introduce into evidence verified pretrial applications filed by Mastrota in his own case. According to appellee\u2019s offer of proof, these applications were to be offered as evidence \u201cthat the statements he [Mastrota] has previously made [at the preliminary hearing] were made under duress, under coercion, under threats or promises.\u201d\nThe trial court correctly refused to admit both the tape and the pretrial applications into evidence. We have held that \u201cour common law permits the admission of an unavailable witness\u2019 prior recorded testimony from a preliminary hearing, provided the defendant had counsel and a full opportunity to cross-examine the witness during the earlier proceeding.\u201d Commonwealth v. Scarborough, 491 Pa. 300, 317, 421 A.2d 147, 155 (1980). \u201cA witness who invokes the privilege against self-incrimination is \u2018unavailable\u2019 for purposes of the hearsay exception permitting the introduction of the notes of his testimony from a prior judicial proceeding.\u201d Commonwealth v. Rodgers, 472 Pa. 435, 452, 372 A.2d 771, 779 (1977) (plurality opinion). The tape of Mastrota\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony was thus admissible against appellee precisely because appellee had counsel and an opportunity, which he in fact exercised, to cross-examine Mastrota at that hearing.\nIf we were to permit appellee to impeach an unavailable coconspirator\u2019s prior testimony through the admission of subsequently created tapes and \u2022 pretrial applications, we would open the door to every coconspirator to claim in a letter, tape or pretrial application that his prior testimony was false or coerced. This would deprive the opposing party of any opportunity to rehabilitate its witness and make a mockery of the truth-seeking purpose of trial. The trial would thus become a contest of hearsay tapes, memoranda and legal pleadings, none of which were ever subject to cross-examination. This we will not allow.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed and the case is transferred to the Superior Court for further proceedings.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which O\u2019BRIEN, C. J., joined.\nFLAHERTY, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nNIX, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. Appellee\u2019s direct appeal to this Court was placed on the Special Transfer Docket and transferred to the Superior Court. The Superi- or Court panel members were Justice Robert N. C. Nix, Jr. of the Supreme Court, Judge Donald Wieand of the Superior Court, and Judge I. Martin Wekselman of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas.\n. This tape mysteriously appeared in appellee\u2019s son\u2019s mailbox on September 1,1976, three and one-half months after appellee\u2019s preliminary hearing.\n. Appellee raised four issues in his direct appeal. The three-judge panel found a single issue to be dispositive of the entire appeal; the three remaining issues presented were, therefore, never addressed by the panel. In view of our disposition of this appeal, we are transferring this case to the Superior Court for further proceedings on the three remaining issues."}
