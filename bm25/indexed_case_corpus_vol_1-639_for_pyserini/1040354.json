{"id": "1040354", "contents": "Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court, January 18th 1875,\nPer Curiam.\nWe think that the legacy of the Allegheny county bonds to the widow of Guy Bryan Schott vested at the death of Guy Bryan Schott without issue, but that its payment was suspended until distribution made according to the terms of the will of James Schott. The opinion of the judge at Nisi Prius sufficiently vindicates his judgment, and we affirm it, therefore, for the reasons given by him. Judgment affirmed."}
