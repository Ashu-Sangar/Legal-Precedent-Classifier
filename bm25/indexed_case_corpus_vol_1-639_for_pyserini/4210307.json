Allocatur is DENIED as to all remaining issues. The issue, as stated by Petitioner, is:\nWhether the Commonwealth Court\u2019s reliance on the manner in which the legislature has used \u201cperson\u201d within the UTPCPL as the sole means of establishing legislative intent contradicts existing standards of statutory construction and creates new law requiring that a general reference to a \u201cperson\u201d shall now be considered to include government entities, contradicting the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s opinion remanding this matter to consider precisely that standard, requires reversal?"}
