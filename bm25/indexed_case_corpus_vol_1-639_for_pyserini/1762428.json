{"id": "1762428", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nThis is a workmen\u2019s compensation case wherein the Westinghouse Electric Corporation (appellant) appeals from an order of the Commonwealth Court affirming an award by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (The Board) to Margaret L. Pollard, appellee.\nAppellee\u2019s husband, the decedent Walter H. Pollard, III, was employed by appellant as an internal consultant. On October 7, 1974, the decedent joined his superior for a five-day assignment at appellant\u2019s facility located in Hampton, South Carolina. After a brief tour of this facility, decedent and his superior were invited by a Westinghouse division manager to stay at the appellant\u2019s lodge, a ranch-type house used to provide overnight accommodations for its employees and customers. Arriving at the lodge at approximately 6:30 p. m., decedent requested a scotch whiskey. Shortly thereafter, decedent and several others who were present at the lodge departed for dinner at a Holiday Inn where one round of drinks was ordered. The evening was largely social in nature and the party returned to the lodge at approximately 9:00 p. m. The decedent then went to the lodge game room to continue drinking and socializing. By approximately 9:45 p. m. decedent\u2019s speech became noticeably slurred and incoherent; he stumbled and fell when attempting to rise from his seat. Believing that decedent was intoxicated, two of his co-workers assisted decedent to his room, placed him in bed without removing his clothing, and left him there for the night. The next morning, decedent was found dead, lying fully-clothed on the floor near to his bed.\nAn autopsy and subsequent toxological examination indicated that decedent died from asphyxia due to aspiration of his gastric contents caused by \u201cmultiple depressant drug and ethanol overdose.\u201d On the basis of such evidence and testimony, the referee concluded as a matter of law:\nFIRST: On October 7, 1974, the decedent, Walter H. Pollard, III, died during the course of his employment on premises of the employer due to asphyxia caused by the aspiration of gastric contents into the respiratory tract produced by vomiting following the ingestion of ethanol and drugs and medications which severely depressed his Central Nervous System setting in motion the events which caused death, compensable under the terms and provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act as amended and the judicial interpretations thereof.\nThis conclusion of law was accepted by both the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board and the Commonwealth Court. Appellant now appeals to us arguing that decedent\u2019s death was not the result of an injury related to the course of the decedent\u2019s employment as required under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. We agree and reverse the Commonwealth Court.\nThis Court has stated that \u201c[t]he referee is the finder of fact and the scope of appellate review is confined to an examination of the record to determine whether those findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence, and whether any constitutional rights were violated or error of law committed\u201d. Workmen's Comp. Appeal Bd. v. Pincus Company, 479 Pa. 286, 291, 388 A.2d 659, 661 (1978) (emphasis supplied). In applying this standard to the instant case, we find that it was an error of law for the referee to conclude from the facts that decedent\u2019s death was compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. Section 301(c) of the Act, states in pertinent part:\n\u201cThe terms \u2018injury\u2019 and \u2018personal injury\u2019, as used in this Act, shall be construed to mean injury to an employee, regardless of his previous physical condition, arising in the course of his employment and related thereto . . . ; and wherever death is mentioned as a cause for compensation under this Act, it shall mean only death resulting from such injury and its resultant effects . . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied).\nThis provision makes it clear that injury, or death resulting from such injury, is compensable only if it is work-related, i. e. causally connected to one\u2019s course of employment.\nIn the instant case, decedent\u2019s death occurred as a result of voluntary ingestion of a massive quantity of alcohol and multiple depressant drugs. There was no evidence relating this ingestion to decedent\u2019s course of employment. By itself, drug abuse certainly bears no causal connection to decedent\u2019s course of employment. Accordingly, his death is not compensable under the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nWe reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court affirming the order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board which granted judgment in favor of the claimant Margaret L. Pollard.\n. The toxological report of October 16, 1974 revealed that decedent\u2019s blood alcohol level was .322; also decedent\u2019s urine contained the presence of three separate depressant drugs: Pentobarbital, Propoxyphene, and Phenothiazine. Neither decedent\u2019s own medical records nor the testimony of his physicians show that he had prescriptions for any of these drugs.\n. The opinion of the Commonwealth Court and the vigorous dissent of Judge Mencer are set forth in Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd., 42 Pa.Cmwlth. 147, 400 A.2d 1324 (1979).\n. The Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, Act III, \u00a7 301(c), 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1), as amended.\n. This principle was recognized in Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. v. Borough of Plum, 20 Pa.Cmwlth. 35, 38-9, 340 A.2d 637, 639 (1975) where the court stated, in reference to Section 301(c) that \u201cthe . addition of the phrase \u2018and related thereto\u2019 which follows \u2018arising in the course of his employment\u2019 to us means that the injury, whether it occurred on or off the premises, must to some degree be causally connected to the course of employment.\u201d See also Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. v. Jeddo Highland Coal Co., 19 Pa.Cmwlth. 90, 338 A.2d 744 (1975).\n. As noted in footnote one, decedent\u2019s blood alcohol level was .322. Appellant contends that this evidence and consumption of three separate depressant drugs show that decedent\u2019s death was voluntarily and intentionally self-inflicted (a suicide) and thus not compensable pursuant to Section 301(a) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 431 which prohibits compensation in such cases. The decedent\u2019s taking of his own life was previously placed at issue in Pollard v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 598 F.2d 1284 (3rd Cir. 1979), a companion case to the matter before this Court, wherein Judge Weiner, speaking for the majority, affirmed a jury verdict denying decedent\u2019s widow accidental death insurance benefits. The policies in question barred payment of said benefits when death is caused by or results from \u201cintentional self-destruction or intentionally self-inflicted injury.\u201d Because of our disposition of this case, we do not need to decide whether or not decedent\u2019s death was intentional."}
