{"id": "226000", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM:\nAND NOW, this 13th of June, 2000, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED, limited to the following three issues.\na. Whether insurers should be permitted to violate insurance regulatory laws by enforcing a policy exclusion in a manner different than was represented to gain approval for the exclusion\u2019s use.\nb. Whether, when interpreting the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d in an insurance contract, the court should consider the surrounding circumstances, including evidence that the wording has acquired an accepted meaning through usage in the trade, to determine whether there is an ambiguity in the contract wording.\nc. Whether the phrase \u201csudden and accidental\u201d in a standardized pollution exclusion should be interpreted to require that the release of pollutants be both \u201cabrupt\u201d and \u201clast only a short time\u201d when many courts have disagreed with this interpretation, it violates several canons of contract interpretation, and it conflicts with the meaning previously given to the phrase through usage in the trade and in representations submitted to obtain regulatory approval to use the exclusion in Pennsylvania."}
