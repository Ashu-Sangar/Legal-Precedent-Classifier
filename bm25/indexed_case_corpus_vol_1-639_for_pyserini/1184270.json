{"id": "1184270", "contents": "Per Curiam,,\nThe question is raised in the briefs as to whether the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania can change the venue in civil cases on original jurisdiction. This Court has all the powers of the English Court of King\u2019s Bench by the Act of May 22, 1722, 1 Sm. L. 131, Section 13. The Act of June 16,1836, P. L. 784, Section 1, enlarges these powers. See Schmuck v. Hartman, 222 Pa. 190.\nArticle III, Section 23, of the Constitution does not take away from the Supreme Court any of its inherent powers, nor did the acts passed by the legislature pursuant tO' that section. See Commonwealth v. Reilly, 324 Pa. 558. The only effect these statutes have is to confer on the county courts power to change the venue which they did not inherently possess. See Commonwealth v. Balph, 111 Pa. 365; Quay\u2019s Petition, 189 Pa. 517; Commonwealth v. Smith, 185 Pa. 553; Commonwealth v. Ronemus, 205 Pa. 420; Commonwealth v. Delamater, 145 Pa. 210.\nWe said in Summers v. Kramer, 271 Pa. 189, at p. 198: \u201cThe Act of 1836 applies \u2018as well in criminal as in civil pleas or proceedings,\u2019 and the Court of Kings Bench, to whose jurisdiction ours is assimilated under the Act of 1722, had \u2018cognizance of both civil and criminal causes\u2019: 3 Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries *42; Coke\u2019s Institutes of the Laws of England *71; 6 Bacon\u2019s New Abridgment of the Law 438. Under these statutes and decisions it is clear we have the right, without considering what the court below could or should have done, to direct this case to be heard by some judge against whom no question of prejudgment can be urged; ...\u201d\nSee also Wattson v. Chester & Delaware River R. R. Co., 83 Pa. 254, where Chief Justice Agnew at p. 256 indicated that the power to change the venue in civil cases was not disturbed by the Constitution and statutes passed thereunder. Little v. Wyoming County, 214 Pa. 596, at p. 599, refers only to the power of the county courts and does not concern this Court. In Crawford\u2019s Estate, 307 Pa. 102, at p. 107, we said: \u201cWhen the legislature has not acted on a cause which is of sufficient importance to require a change of venue, the right to such change is not lost, and the power is still lodged in the Supreme Court.\u201d\nWe therefore conclude that this Court has the power to change the venue in civil cases and we accordingly make such order."}
