{"id": "1823746", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nWe must decide whether an employer\u2019s immunity from tort actions, guaranteed by the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 1 et seq., protects its insurance carrier if the insurer is alleged to have engaged in fraud and deceit to deprive an injured employee of his workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\nThe underlying workers\u2019 compensation claim arose as follows. Mr. Kuney, the appellee, was employed by Continental Data Systems, and on February 4, 1985, he was injured on the job. He filed a claim petition, and PMA Insurance Company, his employer\u2019s compensation carrier, refused to pay any benefits, despite its alleged knowledge that he was clearly entitled to some compensation. Moreover, Kuney alleges that PMA decided to deny benefits but to conceal this decision from him in order to defeat his rights under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and the federal and state constitutions.\nOn February 10,1987, the referee decided that Mr. Kuney had sustained a compensable work-related injury on February 4, 1985, and was entitled to total disability benefits. The referee awarded interest on all past-due compensation and ordered PMA to pay Mr. Kuney\u2019s litigation expenses and counsel fees, due to the referee\u2019s conclusion that PMA had no reasonable basis to contest the claim. PMA appealed the decision, and continued to withhold payment, allegedly in order to impose extreme financial hardship on the appellee without any legal justification. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (W.C.A.B.) reversed that part of the referee\u2019s decision which concluded that PMA had had no reasonable basis to contest the compensation claim. On appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed the W.C.A.B., reinstating the award of the appellee\u2019s counsel fees, holding that PMA had failed to establish that it had a reasonable' basis for contesting the claim petition. Kuney v. Work men\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 127 Pa.Cmwlth. 628, 562 A.2d 931 (1989).\nConcurrently with the litigation of the workers\u2019 compensation claim, the appellee filed this civil action against PMA, seeking damages for injuries allegedly sustained by him as a result of PMA\u2019s fraudulent handling of his compensation claim. PMA filed preliminary objections which were sustained by the trial court, due to its holding that the appellee\u2019s sole remedy for injuries stemming from PMA\u2019s conduct in processing his compensation claim is provided by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed and remanded for further proceedings, holding that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act did not bar the appellee\u2019s lawsuit against his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. 379 Pa.Super. 598, 550 A.2d 1009. We granted allocatur to consider whether a common law tort action is proper under these circumstances.\nThe exclusivity clause of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a):\nis a version of the historical quid pro quo employers received for being subjected to a no-fault system of compensation for worker injuries. That is, while the employer assumes liability without fault for a work-related injury, he is relieved of the possibility of a larger damage verdict in a common law action.\nLewis v. School District of Philadelphia, 517 Pa. 461, 471, 538 A.2d 862, 867 (1988) (citations omitted). The statute therefore deprived workers of some rights in exchange for surer benefits, and immunized employers from common law actions in order to make benefits available to workers who were theretofore without practical remedies. Kline v. Arden H. Verner Co., 503 Pa. 251, 255, 469 A.2d 158, 160 (1983).\nThe employer\u2019s immunity from tort action extends to its workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier, protecting the insurer to the full extent of the employer\u2019s protection. Title 77 P.S. \u00a7 501 states, inter alia: \u201cSuch insurer shall assume the employer\u2019s liability hereunder and shall be entitled to all of the employer\u2019s immunities and protection hereunder ____\u201d (Emphasis added.) See Jadosh v. Goeringer, 442 Pa. 451, 275 A.2d 58 (1971). An employer\u2019s liability for work-related injuries is governed solely by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and the same is true of a compensation insurance carrier. Injuries not covered by the act, of course, are not subject to tort immunity.\nIn determining whether the appellee\u2019s alleged injury is subject to the exclusive remedies of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act or whether it is remediable in tort, we must examine the scope of the statute and its remedies to determine the intent of the legislature. One salient feature of the statute is its statutory penalty provisions. The appellant argues that permitting a tort action would be inconsistent with the fact that the compensation statute provides a comprehensive system for adjudicating workers\u2019 compensation disputes, including specific remedies for the alleged injury. The statute provides for ten percent interest on due and unpaid compensation, 77 P.S. \u00a7 717.1, as well as for penalties up to ten percent for violations of the act, for violations of rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or for violations of rules of procedure, and the penalties may be increased to twenty percent in cases of unreasonable or excessive delay, 77 P.S. \u00a7 991. The statute allows attorneys fees and costs to be assessed against an insurer which contests, without a reasonable basis, a compensation claim. 77 P.S. \u00a7 996. The appellant would have us apply the principle that \u201cwhere statutory remedies are provided, the procedure prescribed by the statute must be strictly pursued, to the exclusion of other methods of redress.\u201d Interstate Traveller Services, Inc. v. Commonwealth, Department of Environmental Resources, 486 Pa. 536, 542, 406 A.2d 1020, 1023 (1979) (Opinion in Support of Affirmance), quoting Erie Human Relations Comm\u2019n ex rel. Dunson v. Erie Insurance Exchange, 465 Pa. 240, 245, 348 A.2d 742, 744 (1976).\nThe cited cases support the conclusion that the comprehensive system of substantive, procedural, and remedial laws comprising the workers\u2019 compensation system should be the exclusive forum for redress of injuries in any way related to the workplace. This principle was established as long ago as 1950. This Court stated: \u201cA reading of this statute and its many amendments makes it manifest that the legislation relating to workmen\u2019s compensation was designed and intended to establish exclusive jurisdiction, practice and procedure in all matters pertaining to such subject matter.\u201d American Casualty Co. v. Kligerman, 365 Pa. 168, 172, 74 A.2d 169, 172 (1950). When the allegations of a claim have as their ultimate basis an injury compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the claim must be considered within the framework of the statute.\nReduced to its essence, the appellee\u2019s claim is that the insurance company wrongfully delayed his receipt of compensation benefits. This is clearly a matter pertaining to a workers\u2019 compensation claim and must therefore be adjudicated within the framework of the statute, which, as stated above, has specific remedies for such a grievance. The appellee received interest on past due compensation as well as attorneys fees and legal costs which were assessed against the insurer for contesting, without a reasonable basis, his compensation claim.\nIt is fruitless to argue that the appellee has nevertheless failed to receive full indemnification for the injury he suffered through the insurance company\u2019s allegedly fraudulent handling of his claim. Benefits payable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act are normally the limit of a worker\u2019s recovery even though compensatory damages in a tort action might be much higher. For instance, a worker who loses a foot is entitled to receive only the following: two-thirds of his wages for two hundred fifty weeks and disability benefits during a healing period not to exceed a maximum of twenty-five weeks, 77 P.S. \u00a7 513(4) and (25), though such damages might seem paltry recompense for the dismemberment. Thus it has been stated:\nWhen an employee sustains injuries which bring him within the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, the amount he is to be compensated depends upon the provisions of the Act. That compensation is his exclusive remedy. Its exclusivity is not destroyed and the employee does not acquire additional remedies merely because the provisions of the Act fail to provide what he deems to be adequate or full compensation for injuries sustained.\nKline v. Arden H. Verner Co., 307 Pa.Super. 573, 576, 453 A.2d 1035, 1036 (1982), aff\u2019d 503 Pa. 251, 469 A.2d 158 (1983), citing Scott v. C.E. Powell Coal Co., 402 Pa. 73, 166 A.2d 31 (1960). We have long recognized that the adequacy of compensation is solely a matter for the legislature.\nThe nature and extent of the remedy provided by the General Assembly in a remedial statute [such as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act] is within the sound judgment of the legislature. That discretion should not be intruded upon by the judicial branch. The urged recognition of a common law cause of action would, in fact, constitute that type of unwarranted and impermissible intrusion.\nKline v. Arden H. Verner Co., 503 Pa. at 258, 469 A.2d at 161 (Nix, J., now C.J., concurring).\nAccordingly, inasmuch as the appellee\u2019s claim is ultimately based upon an injury compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, he is limited to the remedies provided within the framework of the act. The exclusivity provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation law prohibit a tort action against the insurance carrier for damages caused by the insurer\u2019s allegedly intentional mishandling of the injured employee\u2019s compensation claim. The order of the Superior Court, remanding the case for further proceedings in the trial court, must therefore be reversed.\nOrder reversed.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion in which PAPADAKOS, J., joins.\nDue to this holding, we need not consider the second argument of the appellant, which is that the insurer is immune from this tort action due to the exclusivity of the remedies provided by the Unfair Insurance Practices Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1171.1 et seq., as interpreted by this Court in D\u2019Ambrosio v. Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Co., 494 Pa. 501, 431 A.2d 966 (1981)."}
