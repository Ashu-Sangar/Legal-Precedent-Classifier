{"id": "1798726", "contents": "OPINION\nMcDERMOTT, Justice.\nThis appeal is from the order of the Commonwealth Court reversing the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Pike County, 490 A.2d 492. The trial court held that the owner immunity granted by the Recreational Use of Land and Water Act (hereinafter Recreation Act) was applicable to the Commonwealth. We agree with the trial court\u2019s holding and therefore reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court.\nAppellee, Anthony Auresto, was injured on February 10, 1982, when the snowmobile he was riding hit a snow covered tree stump on Peck\u2019s Pond, Pike County. Peck\u2019s Pond is located within Delaware State Forest, which is owned and maintained by appellant, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, under the aegis of the Department of Environmental Resources. A complaint was filed by appellee on February 2, 1984, against the Commonwealth, citing an exception to sovereign immunity for injuries caused by a dangerous condition on Commonwealth real estate. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(b)(4).\nPreliminary objections were filed by the Commonwealth in the nature of a demurrer, seeking dismissal of appellee\u2019s complaint on the grounds that the Commonwealth as a landowner was immune under terms of the Recreation Act. The trial court agreed with the Commonwealth\u2019s position and sustained the preliminary objections. On appeal the Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that the Recreation Act was inapplicable to the Commonwealth. This Court subsequently granted allocatur and, for the following reasons, we now reverse.\nThe specific issue before the Court is whether the Recreation Act, which provides landowners who permit their property to be used for recreational purposes an immunity from tort actions, applies to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\nThe Recreation Act reads in relevant part:\n\u00a7 477-3. Duty to keep premises safe; warning\nExcept as specifically recognized or provided in section 6 of this act, an owner of land owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for recreational purposes, or to give any warning of a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity on such premises to persons entering for such purposes.\n68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 477-3. The preceding immunity extends only to owners of land who hold their property open to the public free of charge. 68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 477-6. The purpose of this act is self-evident. It \u201cencourage[s] owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes by limiting their liability towards persons entering thereon for such purposes.\u201d 68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 477-1. Appellee would have us believe that the General Assembly intended to exclude the vast recreational resources of the Commonwealth from this limitation on liability. We disagree.\nWhen the Recreation Act was passed in 1966, the Commonwealth enjoyed the complete protection from liability afforded by the common law doctrine of sovereign immunity. In 1978, the blanket of immunity was lifted, completely exposing the Commonwealth to civil liability. See Mayle v. Pennsylvania Department of Highways, 479 Pa. 384, 388 A.2d 709 (1978). The General Assembly was thereafter forced to enact a statutory prohibition to suits against the sovereign state. However, in doing so the legislature provided eight (8) general areas where liability may be imposed. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(b). Relying on one of these exceptions, appellee brought suit in the instant matter against the Commonwealth for the existence of a dangerous condition on Commonwealth real estate. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(b)(4).\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s response to this suit was to assert two defenses: the first based on an interpretation of the Sovereign Immunity Act in conjunction with the Recreation Act, and the second based on the pristine terms of the Recreation Act itself.\nIt is appellee\u2019s contention that the General Assembly did not contemplate inclusion of the Commonwealth into the protection afforded by the Recreation Act, since at the time the Recreation Act was passed the Commonwealth was not subject to suit. While this argument has some surface appeal it is not dispositive of the issue.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s principal defense is based on section (a) of the Sovereign Immunity Act. That section provides:\n(a) Liability imposed. The General Assembly, pursuant to section 11 of Article I of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, does hereby waive, in the instances set forth in subsection (b) only and only to the extent set forth in this subchapter and within the limits set forth in section 8528 (relating to limitations on damages), sovereign immunity as a bar to an action against Commonwealth parties, for damages arising out of a negligent act where the damages would be recoverable under the common law or a statute creating a cause of action if the injury were caused by a person not having available the defense of sovereign immunity.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(a) (emphasis added). The emphasized portion of the preceding section clearly states that the Commonwealth\u2019s exposure to liability occurs only in instances where a private party would also be subject to liability. Thus, while the Commonwealth as an owner of land may not have been contemplated at the time the Recreation Act was passed, it is obvious that at the time the Sovereign Immunity Act was passed the Commonwealth\u2019s exposure to suit was intended to be the same as a private citizen. Consequently, when the two Acts are read in pari materia the conclusion is inescapable that since a private citizen would have been protected from the present suit so must the Commonwealth.\nAccordingly, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court, and reinstate the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Pike County.\nHUTCHINSON, J., concurs in the result.\nPAPADAKOS, J., files a concurring opinion.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. Act of February 2, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1860, 68 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 477-1 et seq.\n. Appellants consist of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the Department of Environmental Resources (DER), and John H. Bitzer, a District Forester for the DER. For the purposes of brevity, the preceding group will be refered to collectively as \u201cthe Commonwealth\u201d. Appellee also filed suit against one Fred Hesse who is not a participant in the instant appeal proceedings.\n. Act of October 5, 1980, P.L. 693, No. 142, \u00a7 221(1), effective in 60 days.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8501 et seq. (The Sovereign Immunity Act). See Fn. 3, supra."}
