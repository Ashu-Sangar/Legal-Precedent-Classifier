{"id": "1267066", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Hoeace Steen,\nThe question here is whether the attempted proof of a gift inter vivos was sufficient to meet all factual and legal requirements. The court below held that it wag; in onr opinion it was not.\nThe essential facts are not in dispute and are as follows :\nThe decedent, Joseph P. Russell, was married in 1915 to the present appellant, Lillian Russell. He deserted her in 1937 and in 1939 she obtained in New York a judgment of separation from bed and board with an order for her support and in 1943 another order for support in the Municipal Court of Philadelphia. He fell considerably into arrears and on November 4, 1952, appellant\u2019s counsel wrote to him stating that he had been retained by his wife to represent her and asking that he or his attorney communicate with him for the purpose of discussing the matter. Six days later, on November 10, 1952, decedent issued a check on a Chicago bank in the sum of $55,000 to the order of Hildegarde E. Laier, an amount which constituted practically his entire liquid assets.\nMiss Laier, then aged 22, was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Emil A. Laier, in whose family decedent had lived from the time he abandoned his wife, Mr. Laier and he having been employed in the same industrial establishment; there is no question but that he was on intimate terms with the Laier family. Miss Laier testified in regard to the conversation attending the delivery to her of the $55,000 check as follows :\n\u201cUncle Joe [the decedent] came into my room and said that he had fifty-five thousand dollars that he wanted me to take and put in my bank account, and, at a later date, he might possibly ask for some of the money back. And, whatever he left \u2014 whatever he left to me, was to be split between my brother and myself, and it was a gift from him; and I was to please keep the whole transaction a secret. And that was all that was said.\u201d She explained further: \u201cIn November he did tell me, sir, that he would take a portion of the money, and, what was left in my account was to be a gift, to be split between my brother and myself. The amount was not stated.\u201d\nMiss Laier endorsed the check and gave it right back to decedent, who deposited it in her account in the bank. She did not add the amount to the balance in her check book but merely noted it in the back as a separate item against the initials, \u201cJ.P.R.,\u201d and she never made any drawing against it except as hereinafter stated. No gift tax return was filed by decedent in reference to the transfer of this $55,000.\nAs a result of negotiations which ensued after receipt of the letter from counsel an agreement was entered into on June 25, 1953, whereby decedent agreed to increase the Philadelphia support order from $27.50 to $55.00 per week and to satisfy a New York judgment for arrears by the payment of a lump sum of $2,750, appellant agreeing to forgive and release all other arrearages then due.\nOn July 4, 1953, less than two weeks after he had thus been freed from farther claims by his wife, decedent took back from Miss Laier $20,000 of the snm which he had previously delivered to her. Her account of her interview with him on that occasion Avas as follows : \u201clie said that he would like me to give him\u2014 write him a check for twenty thousand dollars. The remaining portion was to be split betAveen my brother and myself. And, I didn\u2019t want to take it. At the time, we had an argument, and he said it was a wedding present from him, and it Avas still to be kept a secret. . . . At that time I did say that I didn\u2019t Avant the money. I didn\u2019t want his money; I was earning my own salary; and I Avas marrying a man that Avas making an income of his own. And, he said that it Avas a wedding gift; and he wanted my brother to have a share, too; because, Avhatever he did for me, he wanted my brother to have just as much. And i accepted it on the basis of a wedding gift.\u201d She noted in her check book against the \u201cJ.P.B \u201d item the $20,000 withdrawal and the $35,000 balance, but she still kept the record of this item separate from the balance of her oivn funds.\nThree weeks after this transaction, on JuJy 28, 1953, Bussell died and by his Avill left half of his estate to Miss Laier (avIio married the following January and became Mrs. Hildegarde L. Reachrist) and half to her minor brother, James E. Laier, and he appointed, their mother as executrix. In October, 1953, appellant filed her election to take against the will, thereby entitling herself to half the estate (no children having been born to her and decedent). Borne two or three weeks thereafter Miss Laier added the $35,000 to her check book balance, and in March, 1954, she issued her check for $17,500 to the order of her brother\u2019s guardian. Appellant filed an objection to the account of the executrix of the estate on the ground that it failed to include the $35,000 as an asset, but tbe court below found that decedent bad made a valid gift of it to Miss Laier. Tbe present appeal is by Mrs. Russell from its decree so bolding.\nIt will be seen from tbe facts thus narrated that there were two transactions between decedent and Miss Laier, and it is ber contention that tbe first created a gift of tbe $55,000 of wbicb sbe subsequently returned $20,000, and tbe second a reiterated gift to ber and ber brother of tbe $35,000. As to tbe first transaction it is our opinion that no gift was effected because donative intent was wholly lacking. It is obvious that decedent, who bad fallen into large arrearages on tbe order for bis wife\u2019s support and was being brought to book in tbe matter by ber counsel, took tbe precaution before entering upon negotiations with him to denude himself of all his cash resources wbicb would naturally have been tbe immediate target of bis wife\u2019s attack, a purpose which was emphasized by bis cautionary request to Miss Laier to keep tbe transaction a secret. But apart from tbe well-nigh obvious inference that tbe delivery of tbe $55,000 to Miss Laier was designed merely to put that sum beyond tbe reach of an attachment and not to make her the owner thereof, ber own account of what was said by decedent in delivering ber the check clearly shows that she was receiving it merely as a custodian and with a definite obligation to return it or any part of it on bis demand. Sbe testified that be wanted ber to take it and put it in her bank account and whatever was left \u2014 not the $55,000 but whatever was left\u2014 after returning any amount he might ask for was to be a gift from him; sbe recognized and accepted an obligation to make such return even to the extent of tbe entire amount. After sbe did return him $20,000 then, and only then, did decedent express an intention to make ber an absolute gift of tbe remaining $35,000; sbe testified that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to take it\u201d; and by thus demurring to its acceptance she conclusively shows that until that time no gift had been made and that decedent had not relinquished dominion and control over the $55,000 or any specified portion thereof.\nAs to the transaction of July 4, 1953, entirely different considerations apply; this time the trouble stems from lack of the formalities legally necessary for the validity of such a gift. On this occasion decedent in effect told Miss Laier, according to her testimony, that she was no longer to be obligated to return the remaining $35,000 but that she was to keep it as a gift from him. The question arises: What does the law require to effectuate the gift of such a chose in action \u2014 the forgiveness or release of an obligation \u2014 as distinguished from the gift of a chattel or tangible object? To constitute a valid gift inter vivos there must be not only a donative intent but also an active or constructive delivery of the thing to be given. In the case of an obligation represented by physical evidence, such as a bond or a note, the delivery thereof, being the best and only delivery that can be made, is sufficient for the purpose. But, as stated in Brown on Personal Property, p. 199, \u00a761: \u201cWhen the chose in action is not embodied in a bond, bill of exchange, promissory note, or other instrument which ... is in a particular sense the tangible representative of the obligation, the difficulty of discovering in a gift thereof something analogous to the delivery of tangible chattels is immeasurably increased.\u201d Accordingly, in the case of the gift of a debt or obligation not so evidenced, the law requires either the delivery of a receipt acknowledging payment in full (Lewis\u2019s Estate, 139 Pa. 640, 22 A. 635; Fassett\u2019s Appeal, 167 Pa. 448, 31 A. 686; Schwarz v. Philadelphia, 337 Pa. 500, 507, 508, 12 A. 2d 294, 298) or a written assignment or some equivalent instrument (Bond v. Bunting, 78 Pa. 210, 218; Hawn v. Stoler, 208 Pa. 610, 613, 614, 57 A. 1115, 1116). A mere oral donation is not sufficient. Repeated throughout the cases is the pronouncement made in 2 Kent\u2019s Commentaries 716, \u00a7439, that \u201cDelivery, in this, as in every other case, must be according to the nature of a thing. It must be an actual delivery, so far as the subject is capable of delivery. ... If the thing be not capable of actual delivery, there must be some act equivalent to it. . . . If the thing given be a chose in action, the law requires an assignment, or some equivalent instrument, and the transfer must be actually executed.\u201d\n\u201cA gift of a debt due by parol can be made only by the creditor\u2019s execution of a release in writing, or the performance of some act by which the debt is placed beyond his legal control.\u201d (citing cases) : 38 C.J.S. 830, \u00a747.\n\u201cAs in the case of gifts of other property, there must be a delivery, actual or symbolical, in order to effect a gift of a debt due by the donee and this delivery must be made by a transfer of the possession of the evidence of the indebtedness or its equivalent. Thus, it has been held that a gift of a chose in action not having such tangible body as to be chattel property, including the gift of a simple debt, cannot be made effective without a deed, the execution of an adequate release or transfer in writing, or the performance of some other act placing the debt beyond the legal control of the creditor.\u201d : 24 Am. Jur. 767, 768, \u00a771.\n\u201cThe fact that the creditor does not intend to call on the debtor for payment of the debt, and so states, no receipt or release being given, does not establish a gift\u201d: 37 A.L.R. 1150 [citing many cases].\nThe cases reciting and implementing this principle are legion.\n\u201cThe rule has long been that no merely oral declaration will transfer a debt into a gift.\u201d Quirk v. Quirk, 115 Fed. 199, 206.\n\u201cWhere . . . the thing given is a chose in action, and represented by a note, bond, or bill made by a third party, all the authorities agree that a delivery of the note, bond, or bill, unindorsed by the donor, will suffice:\u201d [citing cases]. \u201cBut it is equally well settled that when a chose in action is not thus represented by a note, bond, bill, or other instrument in writing, which can be delivered, but is merely a claim against a third party, which must be established by parol, a written assignment of the demand, by the donor to the donee, is essential to complete the delivery, whether the gift be one inter vivos or causa mortis.\u201d [citing cases] : Castle v. Persons, 117 Fed. 835, 841, 842.\n\u201cWhere the subject-matter of an alleged gift is a chose in action, without note, bond, or other written obligation, it has been very generally held that a written assignment is required in order to [effect] a valid gift.\u201d [citing cases] : Parker v. Mott, 181 N.C. 435, 439, 107 S.E. 500, 502.\n\u201cWhere the thing given consists of a debt due the donor by the donee, and no receipt is actually given, no credit entered, and where the evidence of the debt is not canceled, destroyed, delivered to the donee, or otherwise placed beyond the control of the donor, no valid gift is effected\u201d: Ross v. Walker, 44 Fla. 704, 711, 712, 32 So. 934, 937.\n\u201cIn this case the subject of the claimed gift had no corporeal existence. It was a pure chose in action without palpable form, and there was no document, symbol ox* token that was evidence of title to it. . . . the great weight of authority . . . and we think the better rule, is that a gift of a simple debt without palpable form by the creditor to the debtor cannot be made effective without the execution and delivery of some instrument or the performance of some act or acts placing the debt beyond the legal control of the creditor.\u201d (citing cases) : Michael v. Holland, 111 Ind. App. 34, 41, 40 N.E. 2d 362, 365.\n\u201cAs a debt cannot be delivered from one hand to another, the law has provided that it must b.e assigned in writing, and where the debt is to be transferred from the creditor to the debtor, the liability must be extinguished by a release or some instrument of an equivalent character.\u201d: Snowden v. Reid, 67 Md. 130, 132, 8 A. 661, 662.\nWithout extending the list of such quotations, reference may be made to a multitude of other authorities to the same effect, including Adams v. Merced Stone Company, 176 Cal. 415, 418, 419, 178 Pac. 498, 500 ; Wilson v. Keller, 9 Ill. App. 347, 348; Berry, Admr. v. Berry, 238 Ill. App. 507, 510 (\u201cA gift inter vivos made by parol of a chose in action of this character, not evidenced by a written instrument, is invalid.\u201d) ; Tucker v. Brown, 199 Wash. 320, 329, 92 P. 2d 221, 225; Millett v. Temple, 280 Mass. 543, 550, 182 N.E. 921, 922 (\u201cThis principle has its roots deep in the common law and comes from early times [citing a multitude of cases]. The overwhelming weight of authority, if not the unbroken current of decisions, supports this principle.\u201d); Shepard v. Shepard, 164 Mich. 183, 200, 129 N.W. 201, 208; Young v. Power, 41 Miss. 197, 210, 211; In re Gregg\u2019s Estate, 32 N.Y.S. 1103, 1104, 1105 (A gift of a debt owing from the donee to the donor can be made effective only by the delivery to the donee of a receipt or some instrument equivalent to it.); VanCleef v. Max- field, 171 N.Y.S. 333, 336 (aff. 172 N.Y.S. 923); Cohen v. Cohen, 177 N.Y.S. 180, 182 (\u201cIt seems to be beyond argument that no merely oral expression of an intention to forgive an unevidenced debt can effectuate the intending donor\u2019s purpose.\u201d). See also 2 Williston on Contracts, 1283, \u00a7M0 (The requirements of the law for the transfer of an intangible right \u201csometimes defeats reasonable and proper intentions of a deceased owner, but the protection against fraud and the certainty given by the required formalities have been thought a sufficient answer to that objection.\u201d)\nIn the present case, even though decedent, according to Miss Laier\u2019s testimony, intended to release her from her obligation to him, the alleged gift failed because it lacked the receipt, deed, written assignment or similar instrument required by the law to make it effective. The result is that appellant is entitled to half of the \u00a735,000 in controversy and Mrs. Seachrist and her brother to the other half.\nIt remains but to add that the executrix will be subject to surcharge only if she fails to take proper measures for the recovery of the \u00a735,000 and its restoration to the decedent\u2019s estate for distribution as herein indicated.\nDecree reversed at the cost of the estate.\nFor some reason not apparent counsel for appellant, although objecting at the hearing to the competency of Miss Laier as a witness, states in his brief that he \u201cis not relying on the grounds of lack of competency,\u201d and he does not press his objection thereto. It is difficult to see how the alleged gift could have been proved without her testimony; that of the other witnesses was vague and unsubstantial.\nWhile not directly relevant to the present proceedings it may be noted that in this agreement decedent represented that his earnings were in the approximate amount of $10,000 per year and his net worth the approximate sum of $30,000, whereas in fact he was then receiving a salary from the company where he was employed of $29,000 per year and he held stock in that company of a book value of nearly $500,000.\nBlose Estate, 374 Pa. 100, 97 A. 2d 358, cited by appellee, is clearly distinguishable in that it involved the transfer of a savings bank account by a direction to the bank to assign the account to tbe intended donee, such direction being accompanied by the delivery of the bankbook to the donee and by the latter to the bank."}
