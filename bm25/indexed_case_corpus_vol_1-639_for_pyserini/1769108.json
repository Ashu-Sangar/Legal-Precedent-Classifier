{"id": "1769108", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant Anne Pride is the director of the Pittsburgh-based \u201crape crisis center\u201d known as Pittsburgh Action Against Rape (PAAR). She appeals from an order of the Criminal Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County holding her in contempt of court for refusing to comply with a court order authorizing counsel for a defendant accused of rape to inspect that portion of a PAAR file which is purportedly a statement of the complaining witness.\nAt issue is the extent to which a court presiding over a rape trial may authorize counsel for the accused seeking to impeach the credibility of the complainant to inspect a rape crisis center file containing communications between the complainant and rape crisis center personnel. Appellant asks this Court to expand the common law of this Commonwealth to create an absolute privilege for all communications between PAAR personnel and persons seeking PAAR\u2019s assistance. Although we recognize the important societal interest in promoting such communications, we also recognize the compelling societal interest in the truth-seeking function of our system of criminal justice. In harmony with both the societal interest in promoting PAAR communications and the societal interest in the truth-seeking function of our criminal justice system, and consistent with the views of amicus Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union and amicus Women Organized Against Rape, we hold that upon defense request a court should authorize defense inspection of only those statements of the complainant contained in the file which bear on the facts of the alleged offense. The court, however, must not permit defense inspection of statements of the complainant having no bearing on the facts of the alleged offense and relating instead only to the counselling services PAAR provides. The trial court shall not permit defense review of any other aspect of the file.\nWe remand to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nI. PAAR\nPAAR is a private, non-profit corporation formed in 1974 which provides counselling to victims of rape and other forms of sexual assault. PAAR also provides educational programs. PAAR is one of twenty-seven such centers throughout this Commonwealth and, in appellant\u2019s estimation, \u201cone of hundreds throughout the United States.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 6.\nPAAR is funded, in part, by the federal Law Enforcement Assistance Administration (LEAA). LEAA funds permit a staff of five. In addition, about seventy volunteers maintain a twenty-four hour telephone line for what are termed \u201ccrisis calls.\u201d Appellant states that\n\u201c[t]he volunteers are extensively trained in rape-crisis counseling. They listen, offer support to those who call regardless of when crime occurred, and aid in providing the needed physical, psychological and social help.\u201d\nId.\nAccording to appellant; once PAAR is contacted concerning a sexual assault, a PAAR staff member typically fills out a one-page intake form called an \u201cInitial Report Form.\u201d See Appendix. Included in the Form are twelve sections addressing specific topics. The staff member identifies the following:\n(1) Type of Assault\n(2) Race and Sex of Victim\n(3) Time Between Assault and PAAR Contact\n(4) Neighborhood or Location of Assault\n(5) Does Victim Know Actor?\n(6) Age of Victim\n(7) Approximate Length of Call\n(8) Did Victim Receive Medical Care?\n(9) Did Victim Report to Police?\n(10) If Reported to Police, What is Disposition?\n(11) What Services Did Victim Call For\n(12) Caller Was\nAppellant provides no other details concerning the contents of a typical client file. She states, however, that the Initial Report Forms\n\u201care not for the purpose of obtaining the victim\u2019s statement in the legal sense. Attention is placed on the condition of the victim, both physically and psychologically. Also, the counselor inquires of the treatment the victim has received from various individuals and agencies that she or he has encountered in dealing with her/his crisis legally or medically. The information is used to ascertain the victim\u2019s medical and psychological needs and to monitor the various institutional systems that the victim may encounter. In most cases, if not all, the forms are filled in after talking with the client to avoid the atmosphere of direct questioning.\u201d\nBrief for Appellant at 24.\nII. Criminal Proceeding\nThe contempt citation at issue stems from the case of Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Keith Glover, No. CC8002479. The accused is charged with rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, simple assault, and terroristic threats for allegedly forcing the complainant, Mary Jane Weiss, to engage in sexual intercourse, including intercourse per os, at the complainant\u2019s apartment.\nTrial commenced on July 10, 1980. At trial, the complainant testified that the accused, a chemistry classmate, entered her apartment on the understanding that she would help him with some chemistry problems. According to the complainant, upon completion of the problems the accused attacked her. On cross-examination, the accused sought to develop a theory of consent.\nOn both direct and cross-examination, the complainant testified that following the alleged attack she spoke with PAAR personnel. In the presence of the jury, the accused sought to probe whether the victim had been \u201ccoached\u201d by PAAR. The trial court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection to such an inquiry in the jury\u2019s presence. The court, however, permitted the accused to proceed outside the presence of the jury.\nDuring this proceeding, the court questioned Christine Corbett, who had been named by the complainant as a PAAR volunteer with whom she spoke. Corbett made no mention of the \u201cInitial Report Form.\u201d Instead, she testified that, as a result of her discussion with the complainant, she filed a \u201cmedical advocacy report.\u201d Corbett described the report only as\n\u201ca statement as to what time I was called, what the circumstances were of the rape as related by the victim, and what is to happen with the case . . . . \u201d\nThe following colloquy ensued between the court and Corbett:\n\u201cQ [By the Court]. So it is ... a matter of routine an advocate for [PAAR] files a written report with [PAAR] setting forth facts which are told to that advocate by the alleged victim of the crime?\nA [By Corbett]. A brief summary of it. If the victim does not always \u2014 we don\u2019t go in and ask for them to tell us what happened. If the victim volunteers information as to the occurrences during the rape, those will in outline form be on the form itself.\u201d\nThe court, however, did not inquire into what information, if any, complainant Weiss \u201cvolunteered.\u201d\nThe accused requested the court to order \u201cproduction of any written reports of statements made by the alleged victim of this crime . . . which remain on file with [PAAR].\u201d The court then requested appellant Pride to appear before the court with PAAR\u2019s file on this case to enable the court, in camera, to determine whether the file \u201cmust be available for inspection to protect the constitutional rights of the person accused of a crime.\u201d\nAppellant honored the court\u2019s request. At the in camera hearing held July 11, 1980, the complainant consented to the trial court\u2019s review of the PAAR file.\nNo inquiry into the preparation or contents of the file appears on this record. Nor was the PAAR file made a part of the record. Only the following determination was made:\n\u201cThis Court will find as a matter of fact after reviewing the statement recorded by Ms. Brown and Ms. Corbett [(PAAR personnel)] that statements are consistent with testimony made by Miss Weiss [(the complainant)] and would not give rise to a defense, would not give the defense grounds to cross examine on its basis of prior inconsistent testimony [sic].\u201d\nHowever, the court went on to agree with the accused that \u201cthe defendant and the defense have at all times the right to determine whether or not there are inconsistencies in prior statements given.\u201d Thus it ordered appellant to permit counsel for the accused\n\u201cto review only that portion of the report which was recorded by Ms. Corbett or Ms. Brown and purports to be a statement made by Miss Weiss on the alleged night \u2014 on the night of this alleged occurrence.\u201d\nUpon appellant\u2019s refusal to comply, the court held her in contempt of court, remanding her to the Allegheny County Jail until she complied with the court\u2019s order. PAAR\u2019s file remains outside the present record.\nAppellant obtained a stay of the trial court\u2019s contempt citation from Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) O\u2019Brien of this Court. On August 26, 1980, this Court granted appellant\u2019s petition to assume plenary jurisdiction. Argument was expedited and heard on October 22, 1980.\nIII. The Privilege\nAppellant does not argue that any statute of this Commonwealth specifically accords privileged status to communications between PAAR personnel and persons seeking PAAR\u2019s assistance. Rather, as previously mentioned, appellant argues the common law should be expanded to include the claimed privilege. See 8 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2285 at p. 527 (McNaughton ed. 1961). Such an expansion would, of course, absent the complainant\u2019s consent, foreclose even the in camera review of the PAAR file which was conducted here.\nThere is an undoubtable public interest in helping victims of rape to cope with inevitable disruption of emotional stability caused by the physical assaults they suffer. There is an equally compelling public interest in encouraging victims of violent crime to come forward. We would be closing our eyes to reality were we to discount the value of rape crisis centers in fostering these vital public interests.\nIt must be remembered, however, that our system of criminal justice is a search for truth. As the Supreme Court of the United States observed, \u201cdisclosure, rather than suppression, of relevant materials ordinarily promotes the proper administration of criminal justice.\u201d Dennis v. United States, 384 U.S. 855, 870, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 1849, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966). Accord, e. g., Lewis v. Court of Common Pleas, 436 Pa. 296, 304 n.4, 260 A.2d 184, 189 n.4 (1969). So too, the American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice states: \u201cWhere life, liberty and protection of communities from crime are the stakes, gamesmanship is out of place.\u201d Standards Relating to Discovery and Procedure Before Trial \u00a7 1.1 Comment at p. 31 (Approved Draft 1970).\nIn a wide range of circumstances courts have sought to promote the truth-finding process. In Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 74 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed. 503 (1954), the Supreme Court of the United States permitted the Government\u2019s use of unlawfully obtained physical evidence to impeach an accused\u2019s false assertions on direct testimony.\n\u201cIt is one thing to say that the Government cannot make an affirmative use of evidence unlawfully obtained. It is quite another to say that the defendant can turn the illegal method by which the evidence in the Government\u2019s possession was obtained to his advantage, and provide himself with a shield against contradiction of his untruths.\u201d\n347 U.S. at 65, 74 S.Ct. at 356. In United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 95 S.Ct. 2160, 45 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), the Court held that the Government is entitled to review a defense investigator\u2019s report of statements made by prosecution witnesses which the defense plans to use for impeachment purposes. \u201cProduction of the report might substantially enhance \u2018the search for truth.\u2019 \u201d 422 U.S. at 232, 95 S.Ct. at 2167, quoting Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970) (notice-of-alibi rule a constitutionally permissible device for assuring truthful defenses). Out of similar concern, this Court in Lepley v. Lycoming County Court of Common Pleas, 481 Pa. 565, 393 A.2d 306 (1978), upheld a trial court order requiring a defendant to make available to the prosecution his tape recording of the preliminary hearing testimony of a Commonwealth witness no longer willing to testify.\nThe truth-finding function of our system of criminal justice must circumscribe the absolute privilege appellant would have this Court create. We are guided by the admonition of Wigmore:\n\u201cFor more than three centuries it has now been recognized as a fundamental maxim that the public (in the words sanctioned by Lord Hardwicke) has a right to every man\u2019s evidence. When we come to examine the various claims of exemption, we start with the primary assumption that there is a general duty to give what testimony one is capable of giving and that any exemptions which may exist are distinctly exceptional. .. . \u201d\n8 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2192 at p. 70 (McNaughton rev. 1961). We are guided, too, by the \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d case of United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974), where the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously refused to permit the former President\u2019s \u201cgeneralized interest in confidentiality\u201d of presidential communications to prevail over \u201cfundamental demands of due process of law in the fair administration of criminal justice.\u201d The Court recognized that a claim of executive privilege is of constitutional dimension. It nonetheless upheld the federal district court\u2019s power to subpoena Presidential materials, stating, in the words of Mr. Chief Justice Burger, that:\n\u201c[w]e have elected to employ an adversary system of criminal justice in which the parties contest all issues before a court of law. The need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary system is both fundamental and comprehensive. The ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or speculative presentation of the facts. The very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on full disclosure of all the facts, within the framework pf the rules of evidence. To ensure that justice is done, it is imperative to the function of courts that compulsory process be available for the production of evidence needed either by the prosecution or by the defense.\u201d\n418 U.S. at 709, 94 S.Ct. at 3108. Like Wigmore, the Court said of privileges that \u201c[wjhatever their origins, these exceptions to the demand for every man\u2019s evidence are not lightly created nor expansively construed, for they are in derogation of the search for truth.\u201d 418 U.S. at 710, 94 S.Ct. at 3108. Accord, Trammel v. United States, 445 U.S. 40, 100 S.Ct. 906, 63 L.Ed.2d 186 (1979) (discarding federal privilege against adverse spousal testimony); Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 99 S.Ct. 1635, 60 L.Ed.2d 115 (1979) (rejecting first amendment privilege which would bar plaintiff in defamation action from inquiring into editorial processes of defendant where inquiry will produce evidence material to proof of critical element of action). See also Kansas Comm\u2019n on Civil Rights v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 216 Kan. 306, 543 P.2d 1263 (1975) (although disclosure of customer credit ratings intrusive, intrusion justified to protect state interest in investigating claim of race discrimination in granting credit).\nNo less than in Nixon, where a president\u2019s claim of absolute privilege was rejected in favor of the Government\u2019s effort to obtain evidence, we must reject appellant\u2019s claim of absolute privilege. Indeed, at stake here is not only the public interest in the disposition of litigation on the basis of what Wigmore referred to as \u201cevery man\u2019s evidence,\u201d but also basic considerations of fairness to the accused seeking to defend against criminal charges. \u201cWe have consistently held that the prosecution must allow the defense to examine statements in its possession given by persons who testify as prosecution witnesses.\u201d Commonwealth v. Grayson, 466 Pa. 427, 428, 353 A.2d 428, 429 (1976). See also e. g., Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974) (right of confrontation paramount to state interest in protecting juvenile offender witness); Smith v. Illinois, 390 U.S. 129, 88 S.Ct. 748, 19 L.Ed.2d 956 (1968) (no legitimate state interest in denying defendant opportunity to question prosecution witness on real name and address). It would be unfair to erect a privilege that would deny the accused the opportunity at least to ascertain what the complainant previously has said. As Mr. Chief Justice Burger stated in Nixon, \u201c[t]o ensure that justice is done, it is imperative to the function of courts that compulsory process be available for the production of evidence needed either by the prosecution or by the defense.\u201d 418 U.S. at 709, 94 S.Ct. at 3108.\nWe caution immediately, however, that where, as here, the defense\u2019s basis for inspection of a PAAR file is to determine the existence of prior inconsistent statements, only \u201cstatements\u201d of the complainant, and not interpretations or recollections of the PAAR counsellor, are to be made available. Statements of the complainant include only notes that are verbatim accounts of the complainant\u2019s declarations and notes that the complainant has approved as accurately reflecting what she said. As our Superior Court recently observed in a similar context, \u201c[i]t would be unfair to permit impeachment of the witnesses through use of [a police] officer\u2019s interpretation of what [the witnesses] had said, not their own earlier recollections.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hill, 267 Pa.Super. 264, 270, 406 A.2d 796, 799 (1979):, See e. g., Commonwealth v. Wade, 480 Pa. 160, 389 A.2d 560 (1978) (plurality opinion); Commonwealth v. Hustler, 243 Pa.Super. 200, 364 A.2d 940 (1976); Commonwealth v. Bellis, 252 Pa.Super. 15, 380 A.2d 1258 (1977), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 484 Pa. 486, 399 A.2d 397 (1979).\nThe trial court should make whatever inquiry is necessary to determine whether matters contained in the PAAR file are indeed \u201cstatements.\u201d The trial court\u2019s inquiry must, of course, be conducted in camera. Little would be served by a judicial inquiry seeking to identify and protect important interests which is not itself structured to protect against improper disclosure.\nIt is not for the trial court to review these statements with an eye toward the utility or permissibility of their ultimate use at trial. In Commonwealth v. Hamm, 474 Pa. 487, 378 A.2d 1219 (1977), this Court made it clear that:\n\u201c[p]rior statements may, by themselves or in conjunction with other information known by the defense, open up valuable lines of cross-examination for the defense, even though the statements involve matters not directly relating to a witness\u2019 direct testimony. Accordingly, a standard which would permit the defense to examine only those prior statements in the possession of the Commonwealth which relate to a witness\u2019 direct testimony does not truly grant the defense access to all the prior statements which might properly be employed in cross-examination. Again, only the defense can determine whether the statements are helpful; trial court review of the statements is inadequate. As this Court stated in Commonwealth v. Grayson, 466 Pa. [427] at 429, 353 A.2d at [428] 429:\n\u2018Whether the statements of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses would have been helpful to the defense is not a question to be determined by the prosecution or by the trial court. They would not be reading the statements with the eyes of a trial advocate engaged in defending a client. Matters contained in a witness\u2019s statement may appear innocuous to some, but have great significance to counsel viewing the statements from the perspective of an advocate for the accused about to cross-examine a witness.\u2019 \u201d\n474 Pa. at 501, 378 A.2d at 1226.\nHowever, this is not to say that in every case the defense must be given all statements. We cannot rule out the possibility that statements contained in a PAAR file may have no bearing whatsoever on the facts of the alleged offense and may relate instead only to the valuable counsel-ling services which PAAR provides. Such statements reflecting counselling shall be withheld from defense inspection.\nNor is the defense given a free hand to disseminate statements made available by the court. The statements are made available to counsel only for proper use in the defense of the accused. The important interests in providing emotional support to a victim of rape and in exposing and combatting violent crime may require the trial court to fashion appropriate protective orders to insure against improper disclosure or use of the statements) made available. See Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 305 F; American Bar Association Standards Relating to the Administration of Criminal Justice, Discovery and Procedure Before Trial Std. 11 \u2014 4.4 (2d ed. 1978); see also Commonwealth v. Hamm, supra; Kansas Comm\u2019n on Civil Rights v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., supra, 216 Kan. at 321, 532 P.2d at 1275 (court \u201cvested with authority to issue such protective orders as it deems advisable to keep the information from prying eyes and to prevent its misuse\u201d).\nIV. Disposition\nOur sole remaining task is to evaluate the present record to ascertain whether the court properly concluded that a statement of the complainant is contained in the PAAR file. As already mentioned, there is before us no record of the precise contents of the PAAR file subjected to the court\u2019s in camera review. While we do have a sample \u201cInitial Report Form,\u201d we also have the testimony of PAAR volunteer Corbett that she filled out a \u201cmedical advocacy report.\u201d As Corbett described this latter form, it is not the same as the intake form. There is no indication from Corbett\u2019s testimony or from any other source that a statement of complainant Weiss is contained in the medical advocacy report.\nWe remand to the trial court for further consideration of its order in the light of this opinion. If the court concludes that any or all of the materials it directed appellant to turn over to defense counsel are statements of the complainant which do not relate only to counselling services, and thus are within the scope of permissible defense review, its order of contempt of court shall remain, subject to appellant\u2019s purging herself of the contempt. If, however, the court concludes that the materials it ordered appellant to make available are not statements of the complainant or are statements relating only to counselling services, and thus outside the scope of defense review, the court shall vacate its order of contempt. The stay granted by the Chief Justice is to remain in effect only until the trial court makes the determination required by this remand.\nCase remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nO\u2019BRIEN, C. J., joins in this opinion and files a concurring opinion.\nFLAHERTY, J., joins in this opinion and the concurring opinion of O\u2019BRIEN, C. J.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nAPPENDIX\nPITTSBURGH ACTION AGAINST RAPE: INITIAL REPORT FORM\nUpon completion mail to: PAAR Victim Service Coordinator 211 S.

After a full colloquy, the court granted the accused\u2019s request for a mistrial as well as the Commonwealth\u2019s request for an extension of time in which to commence trial under Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 1100.\n. Appellant would, however, borrow from the psychotherapeutic privilege considered by the various opinions expressed in In re B., 482 Pa. 471, 394 A.2d 419 (1978). See also In re June 1979 Allegheny County Investigating Grand Jury, 490 Pa. 143, 415 A.2d 73 (1980). The fact that the function performed by PAAR personnel resembles in some respects the function performed by a psychotherapist does not of itself persuade us that PAAR personnel\u2019s communications with a person seeking PAAR assistance should be absolutely privileged. See In re Cueto, 554 F.2d 14 (2d Cir. 1977) (lay minister can claim no privilege); 2 Weinstein\u2019s Evidence \u00b6 504[03] at p. 504-18 (1980) (\u201cdifficulty of drawing a line\u201d explains exclusion of unlicensed practitioners from psychotherapeutic privilege under proposed Fed.R.Evid. 504).\nWe also disagree with appellant\u2019s suggestion that the federal statute, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3771, and federal regulations, see 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 22.1 et seq., applicable to LEAA-related agencies such as PAAR somehow are dispositive. There is nothing in the language of either the statute or the regulations which would put statements of the complainant sought by the defense here beyond the reach of the processes of a court conducting a criminal proceeding."}
