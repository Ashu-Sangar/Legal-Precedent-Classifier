{"id": "1749714", "contents": "OPINION\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nOn Monday, September 29, and Wednesday, October 1, 1975, appellant, Helen Willing, demonstrated in the pedestrian plaza between building number two and building number three, Penn Center Plaza, downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The plaza is bounded by 15th and 16th Streets, Market Street, and John F. Kennedy Boulevard, and is a well traveled pedestrian pathway between the two court buildings located at City Hall and at Five Penn Center Plaza. While engaged in this activity, which lasted for several hours each day, appellant wore a \u201csandwich-board\u201d sign around her neck. On the sign she had hand lettered the following:\nLAW \u2014 FIRM of QUINN \u2014 MAZZOCONE Stole money from me \u2014 and Sold-me-out-to-the INSURANCE COMPANY\nAs she marched back and forth, appellant also pushed a shopping cart on which she had placed an American flag. She continuously rang a cow bell and blew on a whistle to further attract attention.\nAppellees in this case are two members of the legal profession, Carl M. Mazzocone and Charles F. Quinn, who are associated in the two member law firm of Mazzocone and Quinn, p. c. When appellant refused appellees\u2019 efforts to amicably dissuade her from further activity such as that described above, appellees filed a suit in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County seeking to enjoin her from further demonstration. Three hearings were held, at which the following factual history emerged.\nIn 1968, appellees, who have specialized in the trial of workmen\u2019s compensation matters for several years, represented appellant in such a case. Pursuant to appellees\u2019 representation, appellant was awarded permanent/partial disability benefits which she collected for a number of years. At the time of the initial settlement distribution with appellant, appellees deducted the sum of $150.00 as costs of the case. This sum, according to appellees\u2019 evidence, was paid in full to Robert DeSilverio, M.D., a treating psychiatrist who testified on appellant\u2019s behalf in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation matter. Appellees presented copies of their records covering the transaction with Dr. DeSilverio. A cancelled check for the amount of the payment, and the testimony of Dr. DeSilverio himself, confirmed appellees\u2019 account of the transaction. Appellant offered no evidence other than her testimony that the cause of her antagonism towards appellees was not any dissatisfaction with the settlement, but rather, her belief that appellees had wrongfully diverted to themselves $25.00 of the $150.00 that was supposed to have been paid to Dr. DeSilverio.\nBased on this evidence, the equity court concluded that appellant was \u201c. . .a woman firmly on the thrall of the belief that [appellees] defrauded her, an idee fixe which, either by reason of eccentricity or an even more serious mental instability, refuses to be dislodged by the most convincing proof to the contrary.\u201d The Court then enjoined appellant from\n\u201c. . . \u2022 further unlawful demonstration, picketing, carrying placards which contain defamatory and libelous statements and or uttering, publishing and declaring defamatory statements against the [appellees] herein.\u201d\nOn appeal, the Superior Court modified the trial court\u2019s order to read,\n\u201cHelen R. Willing, be and is permanently enjoined from, further demonstrating against and/or picketing Mazzocone and Quinn, Attorneys-at-Law, by uttering or publishing statements to the effect that Mazzocone and Quinn, Attorneys-at-Law stole money from her and sold her out to the insurance company.\u201d\nMazzocone v. Willing, 246 Pa.Super. 98, 109, 369 A.2d 829, 834 (1976).\nWe granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal, and now reverse.\nThis case raises serious and far reaching questions regarding the exercise of the constitutional right to freely express oneself. We believe the orders issued by the Superi- or Court and by the trial court in the instant case are clearly prohibited by Article I, Section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and by Goldman Theatres v. Dana, 405 Pa. 83, 173 A.2d 59, cert. denied, 368 U.S. 897, 82 S.Ct. 174, 7 L.Ed.2d 93 (1961). In Goldman Theatres we held that Article I, Section 7 prohibits prior restraint on the exercise of an individual\u2019s right to freely communicate thoughts and opinions, saying,\n\u201c[a]part from the Fourteenth Amendment [to the United States Constitution], the guarantee of free communication of thought and opinion is independently protected by our State Constitution of 1874.\u201d\n405 Pa. at 87, 173 A.2d at 61.\nArticle I, Section 7 of the present Constitution of the Commonwealth is based directly on a comparable article and section of the Constitution of 1874, and reads in relevant part:\n\u201cThe free communication of thoughts and opinions is one of the invaluable rights of man, and every citizen may freely speak, write and print on any subject, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.\u201d\nAs we emphasized in Goldman Theatres, Article I, Section 7, of the Pennsylvania Constitution is designed\n\u201c. . . to prohibit the imposition of prior restraints upon the communication of thoughts and opinions, leaving the utterer liable only for an abuse of the privilege.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n405 Pa. at 88, 173 A.2d at 62.\nHistory supports the view that the framers of our state constitution intended to prohibit prior restraint on Pennsylvanians\u2019 right to speak.\n\u201cAfter the demise in 1694 of the last of the infamous English Licensing Acts, freedom of the press, at least freedom from administrative censorship, began in England, and later in the Colonies, to assume the status of a \u2018common law or natural right.\u2019 See State v. Jackson, Or. 1960 [224 Or. 337], 356 P.2d 495, 499. Blackstone so recognized (circa 1767) when he wrote, \u2018The liberty of the press is indeed essential to the nature of a free state; but this consists in laying no previous restraints upon publications, and not in freedom from censure for criminal matter when published. Every freeman had an undoubted right to lay what sentiments he pleases before the public; to forbid this is to destroy the freedom of the press; but if he publishes what is improper, mischievous, or illegal, he must take the consequence of his own temerity. To subject the press to the restrictive power of a licenser, as was formerly done, both before and since the revolution, is to subject all freedom of sentiment to the prejudices of one man, and make him the arbitrary and infallible judge of all controverted points in learning, religion, and government.\nWhat Blackstone thus recognized as the law of England concerning freedom of the press came to be, 133 years later, an established constitutional right in Pennsylvania as to both speech and press; Article IX, Section 7, of the Constitution of 1790 so ordained; and, as already pointed out, the provision still endures as Article I, Section 7, of our present Constitution.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)\n405 Pa. at 88, 173 A.2d at 62.\nA majority of the Superior Court concluded that appellant\u2019s conduct could be restrained without violating any federal constitutional prohibition. Our conclusion that the equity court violated appellant\u2019s state constitutional right to freely speak her opinion \u2014 regardless of whether that opinion is based on fact or fantasy \u2014 regarding appellees\u2019 professional integrity obviates the need for any discussion here of federal law.\nOur resolution should also render unnecessary any discussion of the Superior Court\u2019s proposed exception to the so-called traditional view that equity lacks the power to enjoin the publication of defamatory matter. See generally Annot. 47 A.L.R.2d 715 (1956), and cases cited therein. We do believe, however, that the Superior Court\u2019s observation that \u201cin the present case an action for damages would be a pointless gesture since [appellant] is indigent,\u201d 246 Pa.Super. at 104, 369 A.2d at 832, requires specific comment. We cannot accept the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that the exercise of the constitutional right to freely express one\u2019s opinion should be conditioned upon the economic status of the individual asserting that right. Conditioning the right of free speech upon the monetary worth of an individual is inconsistent not only with fundamental principles of justice developed by the Supreme Court of the United States and guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, but also violates our own Constitution\u2019s express admonitions that \u201c[a]ll men are born equally free and independent, and have certain inherent and indefeasible rights . \u201d (Art. I, Section 1), and that \u201c[njeither the Commonwealth nor any political subdivision thereof shall deny to any person the enjoyment of any civil right, nor discriminate against any person in the exercise of any civil right.\u201d (Art. I, Section 26.)\nIn Pennsylvania the insolvency of a defendant does not create a situation where there is no adequate remedy at law. In deciding whether a remedy is adequate, it is the remedy itself, and not its possible lack of success that is the determining factor. Bersch v. Rust, Trustee, 249 Pa. 512, 95 A. 108 (1915). \u201cThe fact, if it be so, that this remedy may not be successful in realizing the fruits of a recovery at law, on account of the insolvency of the defendants, is not of itself or ground of equitable inference.\u201d Heilman v. Union Coal Co., 37 Pa. 100, 104 (1860).\nThe order of the Superior Court, modifying and affirming the decree of the trial court, and the decree of the trial court are reversed.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which O\u2019BRIEN, J., joined.\nEAGEN, C. J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nNIX and LARSEN, JJ., dissent."}
