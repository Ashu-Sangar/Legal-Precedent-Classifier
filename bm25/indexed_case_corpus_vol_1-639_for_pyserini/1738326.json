{"id": "1738326", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Justice.\nOn August 28, 1968, appellant\u2019s right thumb was crushed while she was working as a spot welder of small parts. Appellant and appellant\u2019s employer (appellee) entered into an agreement for compensation at a rate of $60.00 per week for an indefinite period beginning September 4, 1968. On July 30, 1970, appellee petitioned to terminate the agreement. The Referee denied termination of the agreement. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board thereafter vacated the Referee\u2019s Order and remanded the case for examination of appellant by an impartial physician. After the impartial physician testified before a new Referee, the agreement to pay compensation was suspended. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board affirmed the suspension and the Commonwealth Court affirmed the.Board\u2019s order. The appellant was subsequently granted review by this Court.\nAppellant argues on appeal that the record demonstrates that she suffers a continuing disability due to her injury of August 28, 1968, entitling her to further payments under the agreement. In a proceeding to modify or terminate benefits pursuant to a compensation agreement, \u201cit is clearly the employer\u2019s burden to prove the allegations upon which he relies.\u201d Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board v. Brockway Glass Company, Inc., 21 Pa.Cmwlth. 444, 446, 346 A.2d 916, 917 (1975). See also Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board v. Dill Construction Co., 20 Pa.Cmwlth. 145, 341 A.2d 537 (1975); Servomation Corp. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 15 Pa.Cmwlth. 199, 325 A.2d 344 (1974); Wilkes-Barre Iron & Wire Works, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 9 Pa.Cmwlth. 612, 309 A.2d 172 (1973). The claim of the employer in this case was that appellant is no longer disabled as a result of the August, 1968 accident and that her inability to work is caused by reasons other than said accident. The findings of fact of the second Referee which are adequately supported by competent medical testimony clearly show that the employer did not satisfy his burden of proving these allegations. The Referee not only found that appellant still experiences some \u201closs of function of her right thumb as indicated by her difficulty in getting the same to her forefinger\u201d, but also that there is an absence of proof of the cause of the continuing disability, which cause \u201ccannot be established with reasonable medical certainty.\u201d\nBased on his findings of fact, the Referee made the following conclusion of law:\n\u201cThe injury sustained by the Claimant on 27 [sic] August 1968 has not been proven to be the cause of the Claimant\u2019s present disability. However, and in view of the fact the Claimant does experience minimal residual disability, the employer has indicated it would not oppose an Order for suspension [as opposed to termination].\u201d\nOur scope of review is \u201climited to the question of whether the findings of fact support the Board\u2019s conclusions.\u201d Utter et al. Appellants v. Asten-Hill Manufacturing Co., 453 Pa. 401; 405, 309 A.2d 583, 585 (1973). The only conclusion which may be arrived at from the Referee\u2019s findings of fact is that the employer did not satisfy his burden of proof in having failed to show either that the disability has ceased or that the continued disability is the result of an independent cause. Instead, the Referee erroneously shifted the burden of proving causation to appellant. Since the conclusion of law is not supported by the findings of fact, the compensation agreement should not have been suspended.\nWe reverse the Commonwealth Court\u2019s affirmance of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board\u2019s Order and remand the matter to the Board for further proceedings consistent herewith.\nJONES, former C. J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nROBERTS, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. This Court\u2019s jurisdiction is based on Section 204(a) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, 1970, July 31, P.L. 673, No. 223, Art. II, \u00a7 204, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp. 1977-78), and on Section 903 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, 1915, June 2, P.L. 736, Art. IV, \u00a7 427 (11th para.) added 1972, Feb. 8, P.L. 25, No. 12, \u00a7 3, 77 P.S. \u00a7 903 (Supp. 1977-78).\n. Because of our reversal on this claim, we need not consider appellant\u2019s other arguments."}
