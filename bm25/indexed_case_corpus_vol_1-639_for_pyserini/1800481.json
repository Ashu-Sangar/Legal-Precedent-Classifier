{"id": "1800481", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from a memorandum opinion and order of the Superior Court, 344 Pa.Super. 626, 495 A.2d 615, which affirmed judgments of sentence imposed upon the appellant, Harry Ray Seese, in connection with appellant\u2019s having been found guilty in a trial by jury of statutory rape and corruption of a minor. The incidents upon which the convictions were based involved appellant\u2019s sexual activities with an eight year old girl.\nThe primary issue to be addressed in the instant appeal is whether the trial court erred in admitting testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness, a board certified pediatrician, as to the veracity of eight year old children who claim to have been the objects of sexual abuse. The issue arose in this case because the eight year old victim had testified to sexual contacts initiated by appellant. Specifically, the pediatrician testified that she had, during the preceding four years, treated approximately 90 to 100 cases per year of alleged sexual abuse. Following that testimony, the prosecutor posed to the pediatrician the following question:\nBased upon your experience and your pediatric specialization, does the medical literature say anything about children of the age of eight in giving complaints of sexual abuse or rape as far as their veracity?\nCounsel for the defense objected to this question, and the court sustained the objection insofar as the reference to medical literature, but the court allowed the witness to answer the question with the proviso that the answer be based upon the witness\u2019 own knowledge and experience alone. When the question was rephrased in this manner, the witness testified as follows:\nI think there is a couple of points to be made and to be objective about this. The first is, do children lie when they are put under stress with members of the family? It is very unusual that a child would lie about sexual abuse. Having said that there are many articles I could bring in and submit to the court. Prepubertal children, which she fits into the category of essentially that, do not lie. The sexual abuse literature is fraught with articles, and prepubertal children usually do not lie about matters of sexual abuse no matter how chaotic or uncomfortable their home situation is, one, because they don\u2019t know how to lie about it. They don\u2019t know what to say. It\u2019s not part of the life experience, so everything they say is something they have seen or experienced. It would be very unusual for them to lie. I have seen one child in the four years that I have been doing this that I think was lying. She was a 16 year old girl, and I think she was lying for reasons of placement and so on, but I have not seen any younger children lie, and the articles, the medical literature articles bear that out. Even if she did, it would be very atypical. I can\u2019t imagine if she was going to make up a lie that it would be about____\nThus, although the physician persisted in making reference to the medical literature in her response to the question, the essence of her response was that, based upon her own experience, young children usually do not fabricate stories of sexual abuse because they do not have sexual knowledge sufficient to supply details regarding sexual encounters. Thus, the testimony consisted of expert opinion as to the veracity of the class of potential witnesses of which the victim was a member.\nIt has long been established that expert opinion testimony is proper only where formation of an opinion on a subject requires knowledge, information, or skill beyond what is possessed by the ordinary juror. As stated in Commonwealth v. Leslie, 424 Pa. 331, 334, 227 A.2d 900, 903 (1967) (quoting Commonwealth v. Nasuti, 385 Pa. 436, 443, 123 A.2d 435, 438 (1956)), \u201c \u2018Expert testimony is admissible in all cases, civil and criminal alike, when it involves explanations and inferences not within the range of ordinary training, knowledge, intelligence and experience.\u2019 \u201d See also Collins v. Zediker, 421 Pa. 52, 218 A.2d 776 (1966); Churbuck v. Union Railroad Co., 380 Pa. 181, 110 A.2d 210 (1955). In Collins v. Zediker, 421 Pa. at 53-56, 218 A.2d at 777-778, it was stated,\nPhenomena and situations which are matters of common knowledge, may not be made the subject for expert testimony. In Burton v. Horn and Hardart Baking Co., 371 Pa. 60, 88 A.2d 873, 63 A.L.R.2d 731, this Court said: \u201cExpert testimony is inadmissible when the matter can be described to the jury and the condition evaluated by them without the assistance of one claiming to possess special knowledge upon the subject.\u201d\nAs this Court said in Dooner v. Delaware & H. Canal Co., 164 Pa. 17, 30 A. 269: \u201cThe jury still have some duties to perform. Inferences drawn from the ordinary affairs of life ought not to be drawn for them, and turned over under oath from the witness stand.\u201d\nThe question of whether a particular witness is testifying in a truthful manner is one that must be answered in reliance upon inferences drawn from the ordinary experiences of life and common knowledge as to the natural tendencies of human nature, as well as upon observations of the demeanor and character of the witness. See Danovitz v. Portnoy, 399 Pa. 599, 604-605, 161 A.2d 146, 149 (1960). The phenomenon of lying, and situations in which prevarications might be expected to occur, have traditionally been regarded as within the ordinary facility of jurors to assess. For this reason, the question of a witness\u2019 credibility has routinely been regarded as a decision reserved exclusively for the jury. Commonwealth v. Shaver, 501 Pa. 167, 173, 460 A.2d 742, 745 (1983) (\u201cIt is solely the province of the trier of fact to pass upon the credibility of witnesses----\u201d); Commonwealth v. Brockington, 500 Pa. 216, 219, 455 A.2d 627, 628 (1983); Commonwealth v. O\u2019Searo, 466 Pa. 224, 229, 352 A.2d 30, 32 (1976) (\u201cTraditionally, we have recognized not only the jury\u2019s ability to determine the credibility of the witnesses but also we have placed this determination within their sole province.\u201d).\nIt is an encroachment upon the province of the jury to permit admission of expert testimony on the issue of a witness\u2019 credibility. Commonwealth v. O\u2019Searo, 466 Pa. at 228-229, 352 A.2d at 32. Indeed, to permit expert testimony for the purpose of determining the credibility of a witness \u201cwould be an invitation for the trier of fact to abdicate its responsibility to ascertain the facts relying upon the questionable premise that the expert is in a better position to make such a judgment.\u201d Id.\nThus, in the instant case, it was error to admit expert testimony as to the credibility of children who are of an age similar to that of the prosecution\u2019s chief witness, the crime victim. Adherence to a rule excluding such testimony i\u00a7 further warranted in view of the consequences that would ensue if such testimony were to be admitted. For example, if testimony as to the veracity of various classes of people on particular subjects were to be permitted as evidence, one could imagine \u201cexperts\" testifying as to the veracity of the elderly, of various ethnic groups, of members of different religious faiths, of persons employed in various trades and professions, etc. Such testimony, admitted as evidence, would encourage jurors to shift their focus from determining the credibility of the particular witness who testified at trial, allowing them instead to defer to the so-called \u201cexpert\u201d assessment of the truthfulness of the class of people of which the particular witness is a member. In addition, such testimony would imbue the opinions of \u201cexperts\u201d with an unwarranted appearance of reliability upon a subject, veracity, which is not beyond the facility of the ordinary juror to assess.\nAlthough opinion evidence is not to be permitted on the issue of a witness\u2019 credibility, there remain, of course, all of the traditional methods for developing, or attacking, a witness\u2019 credibility. In addition, through counsel\u2019s arguments to the jury, the jurors can be made to consider matters of witness credibility, such as, in the present case, whether children are to be believed when they assert claims of sexual abuse. Nevertheless, it is clear that the expert testimony on veracity challenged in the instant case was improperly admitted, and, because that testimony was necessarily prejudicial to appellant due to the fact that the prosecution relied primarily upon the perceived veracity of the victim to establish its case, appellant must be awarded a new trial.\nJudgment of sentence reversed, and a new trial granted.\nLARSEN, J., files a concurring opinion.\n. In view of our disposition of this issue, we need not address appellant\u2019s additional claim that a mistrial should have been granted based upon alleged prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments."}
