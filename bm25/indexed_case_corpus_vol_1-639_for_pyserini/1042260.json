{"id": "1042260", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nPlaintiff claimed compensation for the death of her husband, who was accidentally killed in the course of his employment with defendant; the referee made a compensation order; thereupon,,an appeal was taken to the board, on the ground \u201cdecedent was engaged in an act connected with interstate commerce at the time the accident occurred, and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 2, 1915 (P. L. 738), is not applicable to the case.\u201d\nThe board found the adjudication of the referee \u201cclearly indicates, there was no evidence before him that substantiated the allegation of the claim petition\u201d; and concluded it could not \u201csustain the findings of fact of the referee\u201d; therefore, it made an order granting \u201ca hearing de novo.\u201d\nPlaintiff removed the case to the Common Pleas; which tribunal determined the order in question was merely interlocutory, quashed the appeal and remanded the record. Plaintiff then appealed to this court.\nThe appellant states, inter alia, the following questions for our determination: (1) \u201cDid the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board have the right to grant a hearing de novo in an appeal by defendant solely from the referee\u2019s conclusion of law that plaintiff\u2019s husband was. not engaged in interstate commerce?\u201d (2) \u201cWas the grant of a hearing de novo as aforesaid merely an interlocutory order of the board, from which there could be no appeal?\u201d\nA sufficient answer to the first of these questions is that the conclusion therein referred to comprehends a mixed finding of fact and law; hence the compensation board was justified in treating the appeal to it as involving a question of fact, and in granting a hearing de novo. As to the second question involved, we agree with the court below that the order in question is interlocutory.\nIn McCauley v. Imperial Woolen Company, 261 Pa. 312, we analyze the relevant parts of the Act of 1915, supra, and SO' fully discuss the points of practice here involved that a repetition thereof in this' case would serve no useful purpose.\nThis appeal is quashed."}
