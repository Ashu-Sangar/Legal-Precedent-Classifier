{"id": "461161", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Hughes,\nWhen David L. Ward died on November 12,1913, he bequeathed to Anna Ward, his widow, $50,000.00 in trust, to invest the same and pay over the net income to his daughter Josephine while her mother lived. The mother was appointed trustee. Upon the death of Anna Ward, the principal was bequeathed to Josephine, absolutely. \u00d3n June 24,1915, after Josephine became of age, she signed an instrument in which she ratified and confirmed the setting aside of certain non legal investments to be held in trust for her under her father\u2019s will and requested that her mother, as trustee, continue the investments in these non legal securities. The record discloses that the mother, as trustee, distributed all of the income to Josephine. The trustee filed no account during her lifetime. On November 10, 1942, the mother-trustee died and Milton S. Leidner was appointed guardian for Josephine, who had been declared weak-minded by the Court of Common Pleas No. 7 of Philadelphia County, as of December Term, 1942. After the administrator c. t. a. of the estate of Anna Alexander [Ward], deceased, had filed the account of Anna Alexander [Ward] as trustee for Josephine, the guardian took exceptions to the account, claiming the accounting inadequate in that it failed to disclose the date when the securities were received by tbe trustee and how acquired, that tbe accountant failed to disclose as a charge tbe principal sum originally awarded to tbe deceased trustee, and tbe investments were held in non legal securities. While these exceptions were pending, tbe guardian and accountant agreed to compromise tbe controversy provided tbe Court of Common Pleas No. 7 of Philadelphia County approved tbe arrangement and advised tbe auditing judge thereof. Before any action was taken by that court tbe auditing judge modified tbe decree by allowing commissions and then dismissed tbe guardian\u2019s exceptions, stating in tbe decree: \u201cThere is, however, no reason for bolding this adjudication pending that event because this adjudication can be made, and it is made by tbe direction that tbe Accountant here shall withhold tbe sum of One Thousand Dollars (|1,000.) from funds in bis bands to be paid to Milton S. Leidner, Guardian of tbe said Ward, at any time a proper acquittance is given by tbe Exceptants for said sum.\u201d After this decree, tbe present intervenor, tbe son of tbe weak-minded Josephine, appeared and took this appeal.\nAn examination of this case on its merits disclosed that tbe daughter Josephine, after she came of age and while still of sound mind, signed an instrument requesting her trustee to continue her beneficial estate in non legal investments. \u201cWhere the sole beneficiary requests in writing that a conversion of property should be postponed until further notice by her, tbe executor is legally justified in acceding to her wishes\u201d: Stephen\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 97, 102, 181 A. 559. \u201cA competent beneficiary who with full knowledge of tbe facts and of bis rights expressly consents to or affirms an investment by tbe trustee cannot, in tbe absence of fraud, thereafter question its propriety\u201d: Stephen\u2019s Estate, supra; Armitage\u2019s Estate, 195 Pa. 582, 46 A. 117; Detre\u2019s Estate, 273 Pa. 341, 117 A. 54; Brown\u2019s Estate, 287 Pa. 499, 135 A. 112; Macfarlane\u2019s Estate, 317 Pa. 377, 177 A. 12; Curran\u2019s Estate, 312 Pa. 416, 167 A. 597; Strawbridge\u2019s Estate, 322 Pa. 406, 411, 185 A. 726. See also, Restatement, Trusts, section 216.\nThe other substantive question raised by the appellant is that the trustee\u2019s commissions and counsel fees should not be allowed because, it is alleged by the appellant, the trustee mingled the trust funds with her own moneys, kept no record of income and disbursements, and neglected for thirty years to file an account. The question as stated by the appellant is not supported by the record. There is no evidence of a commingling of the trust funds. The funds of the trust were invested in securities and kept in a separate safety deposit box in the name of the deceased as trustee under the will of David L. Ward. The learned auditing judge found the account \u201csufficiently informative to enable the Guardian of the said Josephine Ward Beale to discover that of which the estate consists\u201d, and an examination of the account will confirm this finding. The securities in which the estate was invested are traced from the time the trust was created up until the accounting, and the record discloses the mother-trustee paid for the benefit of Josephine all of the income produced by the trust and that she had spent on Josephine \u201ca sum far in excess of the income which this estate yielded to her.\u201d It was pointed out in the adjudication, \u201cWhile it is true that the legislation makes a mother-parent liable to a state institution for the maintenance of her child, in this instance the child was not in a state institution and for considerable part of the time was the wife of a man whom she had married many years before her mother died.\u201d On July 2, 1943, the administrator c. t. a. of the deceased trustee filed an income account to which no exception was taken. In view of the beneficiary\u2019s approval of the investments and the clear evidence that there was no mismanagement, imprudent action, or fraud, shown in the handling of the funds of the trust by the mother-trustee, and the findings and conclusions of the court below negativing the implication of such conduct, they are conclusive upon this court: Snyder Estate, 346 Pa. 615, 621, 31 A. 2d 132; Quinn\u2019s Estate, 342 Pa. 509, 514, 21 A. 2d 78; Frank\u2019s Estate, 339 Pa. 499, 501, 15 A. 2d 353. This beneficiary, when competent, had full knowledge of the facts and of her rights, and expressly consented to and affirmed the investments by the trustee and, in the absence of fraud, this intervenor-exceptant cannot now question their propriety: Clabby\u2019s Estate, 338 Pa. 305, 12 A. 2d 71.\nThe court below allowed commissions to the trustee. The trustee was faithful and honest in the administration of her trust, derived no personal benefits therefrom, and was authorized by the beneficiary to carry the estate in non legal securities. It was proper, under these circumstances, to allow the trustee commissions (see Quinn\u2019s Estate, 342 Pa. 509, 515) and counsel fees. The allowance or disallowance of counsel fees rests generally in the judgment of the court of the first instance and its decision will not be interfered with except for palpable error: Foulke\u2019s Estate, 334 Pa. 186, 190, 5 A. 2d 179; Rambo\u2019s Estate, 327 Pa. 258, 266, 193 A. 1.\nAs this case is properly disposed of by the foregoing conclusions, it is unnecessary for us to consider any of the other questions raised on this appeal.\nJudgment affirmed; costs to be paid by the appellant."}
