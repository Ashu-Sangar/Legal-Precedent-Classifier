{"id": "1921085", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nThis is an appeal from a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Montgomery County dismissing objections to the account of John B. McClatchy, executor of the estate of Mary E. McClatchy, deceased. This case was tried as a companion case in the court below with Me Clatchy Estate, also decided today. 433 Pa. 232, 249 A. 2d 330 (1969).\nAppellants, heirs under the will of decedent, seek to surcharge the executor for his failure to include the following items in decedent\u2019s estate:\n(1) $59,849.25 paid to the 69th Street Community House Corporation for life insurance premiums advanced on policies on the life of decedent\u2019s husband. .\n(2) Amounts paid by the estate for the executor\u2019s commission and attorneys\u2019 fees.\nI Life Insurance Premiums\nBetween 1946 and 1957, the 69th Street Community House Corporation paid life insurance premiums on policies owned by decedent on the life of her husband in the amount of $59,849.25. The executor\u2019s account disclosed that Community was reimbursed by the es.tate for the premiums paid.\nUnlike the situation which existed in the McClatchy Estate, supra, there is no evidence that there was any oral or written agreement between decedent and Community for repayment of those premiums. In order to justify this payment the executor relies exclusively upon testimony concerning a statement made by decedent\u2019s husband to an employee of Community. However, there is no evidence that in making this statement decedent\u2019s husband was acting as an agent of decedent and/or had the power to commit her or her estate to any obligation. Consequently, we are of the opinion that the payment of $59,849.25 to Community was improper, and that the executor should be surcharged for that amount.\nII Executor\u2019s Commission and Attorneys\u2019 Pees\nAppellants argue that the estate should not pay the executor\u2019s commission and attorneys\u2019 fees when the services of the executor and the attorneys were directed primarily toward proving that certain assets were not includable in the estate.\nWe reject this argument for the same reasons enunciated in our decision in the McClatchy Estate, supra. The executor\u2019s commission of $7,225 and the attorneys\u2019 fees of approximately $8,750 are reasonable and proper in light of the fact that the net balance of decedent\u2019s estate was in excess of $250,000. Furthermore, there is no evidence indicating that the executor and the attorneys claimed additional fees for the present litigation.\nWe therefore are of the opinion that appellants\u2019 objection as to the propriety of paying the executor\u2019s commission and attorneys\u2019 fees from the estate are without merit and should be dismissed.\nDecree reversed in part and affirmed in part and the case remanded to the court below to enter a decree consistent with this opinion. Costs on appellee.\nMr. Justice Musmanno did not participate in the decision of this case."}
