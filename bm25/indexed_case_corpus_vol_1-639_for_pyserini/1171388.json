{"id": "1171388", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nDefendant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v. should have been granted. Plaintiff was struck by an automobile owned and driven by J. A. Jardine shortly before nine o\u2019clock in the morning on a public highway in what is called the North Side of the City of Pittsburgh. Jardine lived on the North Side and was employed by the defendant on the South Side, the Allegheny River separating the two Sides. Defendant publishes a newspaper. Jardine was a branch manager for defendant with duties involving the distribution of newspapers to carriers in a certain district on the South Side. He used his car, described as a \u201cChevy Coach\u201d to travel to and from his place of employment and also in going about in the district in which he was branch manager.. His work did not begin until he reached his place of employment. Defendant paid him $15.00 a week to defray the \u201cexpenses for the operation of that car.\u201d On the morning of the accident he was traveling from his home to the place of his employment, a distance of several miles. He was on his way to attend what the evidence calls, without describing, a \u201cPep meeting.\u201d The car contained no markings to indicate that it was used in and about defendant\u2019s business though, when the accident took place, there were some copies of the newspaper in the car; in the circumstances, we regard that fact as immaterial: Deater v. Penn Mach. Co., 311 Pa. 291, 166 A. 846.\nThe question is whether the relation in which Jardine stood to the defendant at the time of the accident renders the defendant liable. It is to be observed that he had not yet reached either defendant\u2019s place of business or the district in which his work would be done; the time for him to go on duty had not arrived. The car was his and not defendant\u2019s. It was not being used in and about the defendant\u2019s business at the time. There is nothing to indicate that defendant had, or exercised, any control whatever either over Jardine or over the car at the time. Jardine was then his own master. In such circumstances defendant is not responsible for Jardine\u2019s negligence: Wesolowski v. Hancock Ins. Co., 308 Pa. 117, 162 A. 166; Roberts v. Scott Bros., 315 Pa. 341, 172 A. 681.\nPlaintiff was not injured, as was said in Loper v. Publishing Co., 312 Pa. 580, 583, 169 A. 374, \u201cwhile [the servant was] engaged in that master\u2019s business and within the scope of his employment by the master.\u201d Nor does his evidence show, as plaintiff\u2019s did in Cusick v. Hutchinson, 318 Pa. 316, 177 A. 749, that the particular trip had been authorized and was controlled by the defendant or someone authorized to direct the work. The same conclusion is required if Jardine\u2019s relation to his employer is considered in the light of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation cases holding that an employee going to or returning from work out of hours is, in virtue of that fact alone, not regarded as in the course of his employment: Palko v. Taylor-McCoy Coal & Coke Co., 289 Pa. 401, 405, 137 A. 625; Bossard v. Nallin et al., 93 Pa. Superior Ct. 301.\nJudgment reversed and here entered for defendant.\nFor a collection o\u00a3 cases see Note 87 A. L. E., p. 787."}
