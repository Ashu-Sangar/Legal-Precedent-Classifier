{"id": "860227", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe find no error in this record that would justify a reversal of the judgment. All the questions properly presented by the specifications of error were rightly decided by the learned president of the court below. It is unnecessary to add anything to what is so well said in his opinion; and on that the judgment is affirmed."}
