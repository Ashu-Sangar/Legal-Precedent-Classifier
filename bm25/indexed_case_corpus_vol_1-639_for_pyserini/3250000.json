{"id": "3250000", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nIn its order sustaining the Department of Corrections\u2019 demurrer, the Commonwealth Court indicated that it was addressing the Department\u2019s amended DC-ADM 803-1\u2019s \u201crestrictions on obscene materials.\u201d The court held that the policy was valid in this regard, because it advances a variety of legitimate penological interests. However, the petition for review in this case essentially conceded this point, challenging the policy only to the extent that it extends to non-obscene materials. Since the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order does not address the relevant challenge, it cannot be upheld.\nAccordingly, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order is VACATED and the matter is remanded for further proceedings. We offer no opinion concerning whether the matter is otherwise amenable to disposition on preliminary objections. However, in its final disposition of the matter, the Commonwealth Court is directed to specifically address Appellant\u2019s contention that the Department of Corrections\u2019 policy amendment conflicts with an existing substantive regulation promulgated under the Commonwealth Documents Law which has the force and effect of law.\nJurisdiction is relinquished."}
