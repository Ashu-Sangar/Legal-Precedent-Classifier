The issue, as set forth by the Commonwealth, is as follows:\nDid the Pennsylvania Superior Court err in holding that the mandatory minimum sentence found in 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9718(a)(3) [is] unconstitutional in light of Alleyne v. United States [\u2014 U.S.-], 133 S.Ct. 2151 [186 L.Ed.2d 314] (2013), despite that statutory provision calling for no facts to be found beyond simply being convicted of the enumerated offense?\nThis matter is to be listed together with Commonwealth v.
