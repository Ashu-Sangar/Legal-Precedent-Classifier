{"id": "483852", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court holding that a public utility\u2019s payment of the tax imposed by the Public Utility Realty Tax Act (PUR-TA) was not in lieu of local real estate taxes pursuant to article VIII, section 4 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, P.S. We conclude that the Commonwealth Court erroneously construed article VIII, section 4 and reverse.\nThis case requires analysis of the interaction of article VIII, section 4 and PURTA. A clearer understanding of the issues presented will be facilitated by a review of the history of these two provisions. This then is the beginning of our consideration.\nI.\nFrom 1826, when this Court decided Schuylkill Bridge Co. v. Frailey, 13 S. & R. 422 (Pa.1826), until 1968, when article VIII, section 4 was added to the Pennsylvania Constitution, the imposition of local real estate taxes upon the property of public utilities essential to the utilities\u2019 operation was prohibited unless an act of the General Assembly permitted local taxation. During the 142 years between Schuylkill Bridge Co. and the convening of the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention of 1967-68, the Legislature enacted no law generally permitting local taxation of public utilities\u2019 real estate.\nThe inability of local taxing authorities to tax the real estate of public utilities within their geographical area was a cause of great concern to local authorities and their taxpayers. The exemption was considered a means by which a potential source of revenue escaped local taxation. Furthermore, local authorities asserted that the presence of a major utility in their territory tended to reduce the base upon which property taxes could be assessed.\nThis concern was manifested at the Constitutional Convention. When the Convention convened, the question of local taxation of the real estate of public utilities was submitted by the Preparatory Committee to the Committee on State Taxation and Finance with the following official guidance:\n\u201cIf the continuation of the exemption for property of public utilities is desired, it may be advised to strengthen the Constitutional basis for this exemption by adding a provision to Section 1 of Article IX authorizing the Legislature to exempt such property. If on the other hand, the abolishment [sic] of the exemption for property of public utilities is desired, consideration should be given to adding to the Constitution (perhaps to Section 2) a clause providing that such property shall not be exempt from taxation.\u201d\nPreparatory Committee, Taxation & State Finance, Reference Manual No. 7, at 12 (1967). See Comment, Public Utility Taxation in Pennsylvania: Article VIII, Section 4 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania 1968, 74 Dick. L.Rev. 274 (1970).\nWhen the Committee on Taxation and State Finance presented its proposal to the Convention, the Committee had already resolved that local taxing authorities should be entitled to receive some revenue from public utilities. However, the Committee viewed the imposition of real property taxes directly by the local authorities as undesirable. In its view, local taxation would permit those governmental units in which public utilities were located to reap windfall benefits while other communities would obtain little or no benefit from local taxation. The increased taxation, however, would become part of the utilities\u2019 rate bases and accordingly would be reflected in every consumer\u2019s rates regardless of whether he lived in a community benefiting from the tax. It therefore included in its proposal to eliminate the exemption a plan whereby all local taxing authorities could share in the revenue derived from the utilities. As finally adopted by the Convention, this plan provides that if the Legislature imposes upon utilities \u201cgross receipts taxes or other special tax in replacement of gross receipts taxes\u201d producing revenue equal to the sum that all local taxing authorities would collect if they imposed the local real estate taxes upon the utilities, and if the Commonwealth proportionately redistributed the revenues thus obtained to the local taxing authorities, payment of the state tax would be in lieu of payment of the local property taxes. This proposal was approved by the Convention and ratified by the voters.\nAt the time of the adoption of article VIII, section 4, a gross receipts tax on the \u201cwholly\u201d intrastate activities of public utilities already existed. However, certain utilities, most notably water companies, were not subject to the tax, and other utilities such as American Telephone and Telegraph Co. were exempt in whole or in part because they conducted interstate activities. Moreover, the revenues derived from the tax were inadequate to meet the requirements of article VIII, section 4 and existing law made no provision for distribution of such revenues to the local authorities. For these reasons, additional legislation was required to implement the terms of the new constitutional provision.\nRather than attempt to expand the existing gross receipts tax, the Legislature decided to enact a different type of tax to implement the amendment. On March 10, 1970, the Legislature enacted PURTA, which imposed a state-wide property tax upon the \u201cdepreciated value\u201d of the real estate of public utilities. By enacting the tax, the General Assembly intended to implement the Constitutional provision. Section 4 of the Act provides in part:\n\u201c(a) Payment of the tax imposed by section 3, and the distribution to local taxing authorities prescribed by section 7 [of PURTA], shall be in lieu of local taxes upon utility realty, as contemplated by article VIII, section 4, of the Constitution of Pennsylvania.\u201d\nII.\nFollowing the adoption of article VIII, section 4 and the enactment of PURTA, American Telephone and Telegraph Co. paid the tax imposed by PURTA for 1970 and 1971. Nevertheless, the Board of Property Assessment of Allegheny County assessed AT&T\u2019s local real estate essential to its operation as taxable property. AT&T appealed the decision of the Board to the court of common pleas. That court decided that AT&T was subject to the local tax for the six month period from July 1, 1970, to December 31, 1970, because the Commonwealth had failed to provide for the distribution of revenues collected by it for that period as required by the Constitution. However, the court also held that AT&T was relieved from liability for local real estate taxes for 1971 and succeeding years in which the Commonwealth made distribution of revenues to local taxing authorities as provided by article VIII, section 4 and PURTA.\nAll parties appealed to the Commonwealth Court. That court, relying on its decision in Heller v. Depuy, 2 Pa.Cmwlth. 196, 277 A.2d 849 (1971), concluded that AT&T\u2019s payment of the tax imposed by PURTA was not sufficient to discharge liability for local taxation.\nThe Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision was based on its interpretation of the language of the Constitutional provision and PURTA. Article VIII, section 4 provides that \u201c[pjayment to the Commonwealth of gross receipts taxes or other special taxes in replacement of gross receipts taxes by a public utility\u201d (emphasis added) is in lieu of payment of local property taxes. Section 8 of PURTA provides that \u201cIt is the legislative intent that the tax imposed by this act . . . shall not be construed in any manner as to constitute a replacement for or a repealer of the [gross receipts tax].\u201d (Emphasis added.) The Commonwealth Court concluded that because by PUR-TA\u2019s terms, the tax imposed did not \u201creplace\u201d the gross receipts tax and, apparently, because the Legislature had subsequently reenacted the gross receipts tax, payment of the PURTA tax was not payment of \u201cspecial taxes in replacement of gross receipt taxes.\u201d Therefore that court held that the Legislature\u2019s declaration in section, 4 of PURTA that payment of the PURTA tax should be considered \u201cin lieu of local [property] taxes\u201d was \u201cunconstitutional\u201d as inconsistent with article VIII, section 4. Our review of the history and purposes of this constitutional provision persuades us that the Commonwealth Court erroneously construed the phrase \u201cother special taxes in replacement of gross receipts taxes\u201d in the constitutional provision.\nIII.\nAs we indicated in Part I, the purpose of article VIII, section 4 was to obtain some tax revenues for local taxing authorities from taxes imposed upon public utilities. The Convention, believing local taxation would create certain inequities, agreed that the taxation, collection, and distribution of such revenues should be assigned to the Commonwealth. The manner in which the Commonwealth chose to impose the tax and collect the revenue was apparently a matter of relatively little significance to the Convention and was left to the Legislature.\nThe proceedings of the Convention support the conclusion that the Convention was in no sense enamored of the gross receipts tax. The initial proposal submitted by the Taxation Subcommittee to the Committee on State Taxation and Finance provided for the imposition of a state-wide real estate tax on public utilities as the source of the revenues to be distributed to the local taxing authorities. However, upon further consideration by the Committee, the proposal was altered to provide for the collection of the revenue by means of the gross receipts tax. Thus, when the proposal was submitted to the Convention, it provided that \u201cgross receipts taxes shall be in lieu of local taxes. . . . \u201d The Committee\u2019s reasons for this change were strictly administrative: because the gross receipts tax already existed, implementation of the amendment would not require the creation of new machinery to collect the tax.\nOn second consideration of the proposal by the Convention as a whole, the proposal was amended to read \u201cpayment of gross receipts or any other special tax.\u201d This amendment was made in recognition that at some time in the future, the Legislature might decide that a different tax would be preferable to the gross receipts tax. The purpose of this amendment was obviously to give the General Assembly more flexibility in choosing the manner in which the Commonwealth would obtain the revenue to be distributed to the local taxing authorities. The Convention did, however, insist that any alternative tax be a \u201cspecial\u201d one, that is a tax specifically designed to implement article VIII, section 4 so as not to adversely affect the Commonwealth\u2019s general revenues.\nThe final draft of this part of the amendment substituted the words \u201cgross receipts taxes or other special taxes replacing gross receipts taxes\u201d for \u201cgross receipts or other special taxes.\u201d This change was apparently made by the Committee on Style and Drafting. That this revision reflected no substantive change is indicated by the subsequent debates which clearly indicate that the Convention still intended by the provision to preserve in the Legislature the power to utilize a tax other than the gross receipts tax for the purpose of this amendment.\nIV.\nThe utilization of such an alternative tax is exactly what the Legislature accomplished by the enactment of PURTA. Clearly, the Legislature intended that the PURTA tax should \u201creplace\u201d the gross receipts tax as the source of revenue under article VIII, section 4. The tax imposed by PURTA is the sole source of revenue for distribution to local taxing authorities pursuant to article VIII, section 4 and PURTA. Furthermore, because the new tax is designed exclusively for this purpose and therefore will not affect the Commonwealth\u2019s general revenues, it is a \u201cspecial tax\u201d as contemplated in the Constitution. Thus by the enactment of PURTA the Legislature was merely doing what the Convention foresaw it might \u2014 replacing the gross receipts tax with another special tax to provide revenue for article VIII, section 4 distribution. The imposition of the PURTA tax fully conforms with the constitutional provision.\nThat the Legislature decided to retain the gross receipts tax as a source of general revenue for the Commonwealth does not affect this conclusion. The Constitution\u2019s use of \u201creplacement\u201d in the new provision does not mean that so long as a gross receipts tax exists no other tax may be employed for article VIII, section 4 purposes. Any other construction of \u201cother special taxes in replacement of gross receipts taxes\u201d would assign a magical significance to the gross receipts tax not mandated by the Constitution. The objective of the constitutional amendment is accomplished if these words are construed to mean any special tax the Legislature imposes for article VII, section 4 purposes.\nWe therefore conclude that the Legislature\u2019s expression in section 8 of PURTA that the tax not be interpreted to \u201creplace\u201d the gross receipts tax and its subsequent reenactment of the gross receipts tax do not render PURTA in any sense irreconcilable with article VIII, section 4. Section 8 was included in PURTA to assure that it would not be interpreted as impliedly repealing the gross receipts tax and thereby adversely affecting this source of general Commonwealth revenues. Thus the PURTA tax is a special tax imposed specially for purposes of article VIII, section 4. Payment of that tax by a utility and distribution by the Commonwealth to local taxing authorities is in lieu of local real estate taxation.\nThe American Telephone and Telegraph Co. is subject to the tax imposed by PURTA and, having paid that tax, is not also subject to local taxation of its operating realty. Accordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed.\n. American Telephone and Telegraph Co.\u2019s appeal in the Commonwealth Court was heard in conjunction with the appeals of three other utilities. See note 17, infra. Duquesne Light Co. v. Board of Property Assessment, 10 Pa.Cmwlth. 41, 299 A.2d 660, aff\u2019d on rehearing, 10 Pa.Cmwlth. 60, 309 A.2d 193 (1973). Following the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision on hearing, AT&T sought and was granted on appeal to this Court. See Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art.

PUR-TA is also popularly referred to as Act 66.\n. Pa.Const. art. VIII, \u00a7 4 provides:\n\u201cThe real property of public utilities is subject to real estate taxes imposed by local taxing authorities. Payment to the Commonwealth of gross receipts taxes or other special taxes in replacement of gross receipts taxes by a public utility and the distribution by the Commonwealth to the local taxing authorities of the amount as herein provided shall, however, be in lieu of local taxes upon its real property which is used or useful in furnishing its public utility service. The amount raised annually by such gross receipts or other special taxes shall not be less than the gross amount of real estate taxes which the local taxing authorities could have imposed upon such real property but for the exemption herein provided. This gross amount shall be determined in the manner provided by law. An amount equivalent to such real estate taxes shall be distributed annually among all local taxing authorities in the proportion which the total tax receipts of each local taxing authority bear to the total tax receipts of all local taxing authorities, or in such other equitable proportions as may be provided by law.\n\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of this section, any law which presently subjects real property of public utilities to local real estate taxation by local taxing authorities shall remain in full force and effect.\nSchedule\n\u201cSection four shall take effect July 1, 1970, unless the General Assembly earlier provides enabling legislation in accordance therewith.\u201d\n. See, e. g., Independence Twp. School Dist. Appeal, 412 Pa. 302, 309, 194 A.2d 437, 440 (1963).\n. For a discussion of the history of the exemption, see Comment, Exemption of Real Property of Public Utilities from Local Taxation in Pennsylvania, 13 U.Pitt.L.Rev. 263 (1952).\n. See, e. g., 2 Debates of the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention of 1967-68, at 689 (1969) [hereinafter cited as Debates] (remarks of Delegate Hocker).\n. Prior to the adoption of the 1968 constitutional amendments, the taxation article was numbered article IX. The amendments renumbered it article VIII.\n. 1 Debates 429 (remarks of Delegate Woodring, co-chairman of the Committee on Taxation & State Finance).\n. Pa.Const. art. VIII, \u00a7 4.

Interstate activities of utilities were apparently exempted to avoid conflict with the commerce clause of the federal Constitution. U.S.Const. art. I, i 8. See Philadelphia & S. M. S. S. Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U.S. 326, 7 S.Ct. 1118, 30 L.Ed. 1200 (1887).\n. Some of the concerns that may have made expansion of the gross receipts tax appear unwise to the General Assembly were the difficulties presented in avoiding federal constitutional problems in taxing the gross receipts of utilities conducting interstate activities, see n. 11 supra, and the disparity of the ratios of property values to operating revenues among utilities. See Joint State Gov\u2019t Comm\u2019n, Taxation of Public Utilities 16 (1970).\n. The Commonwealth Court has held that the Legislature met the constitutionally imposed deadline in the schedule appended to the provision. See note 19 infra.\n.

The utilities appealed from the trial court\u2019s conclusion that they were subject to local taxation for the last half of 1970. The Board of Property Assessment appealed from the court\u2019s holding that payment of the PURTA tax was in lieu of local property taxes.\n. The Commonwealth Court held that because the other utilities had paid the gross receipts tax they were not subject to property taxes. It also held that under PURTA, adequate provision was made for the distribution to the local taxing authorities for the last half of 1970. It therefore reversed the holding of the common pleas court on this issue. The Board sought an appeal to this Court on these parts of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision but we refused to grant the appeal on March 29, 1973.\n. PURTA \u00a7 8, 72 P.S. \u00a7 3278 (Supp.1974):\n\u201cIt is the legislative intent that the tax imposed by this act shall be in addition to any tax now or hereinafter imposed upon the gross receipts of public utilities under the Act of June 1, 1889 (P.L. 420), and this act shall not be construed in any manner as to constitute a replacement for or a repealer of the above cited act.\u201d\nSee note 10 supra and accompanying text. 21.\n.

Id. at 630:\n\u201cDelegate Pott [co-chairman of Committee on Taxation].\n\u201cConsideration was given to a state realty tax with distribution of the proceeds to the local districts. We did not favor this particularly, partly because it would have involved much red tape, many additional state employees to administer it, probably the establishment of a separate new department within the Commonwealth. Also, it would have increased the administrative cost of the utilities and, hence,, raise cost to their consumers, and partly because we feel there is a much better way at hand.\u201d\n. Id. at 612.\n. 2 Debates 705.\n\u201cDelegate Goldman. Mr. President, I would like to ask Chairman Woodring what he means by the words \u2018or any other special tax?\u2019\n\u201cDelegate Woodring. [Chairman of the Subcommittee on Taxation]. Mr. President, we endeavored to state our position on this last Friday morning during the interrogation and again this morning. So long as the legislature continues to impose a gross receipts tax, we would not need any other words, but we cannot envision in this Convention today what is going to happen in the future.\n\u201cTherefore we added \u2018or any other special tax\u2019 as a catchall in case the gross receipts tax would come to be known by some other name or might be repealed or some other tax substituted, and so forth. We thought it was desirable to put something there to protect the municipalities against some legislative change which we are not now able to contemplate.\n\u201cThe gross receipts tax or any other special tax may be distributed in lieu of the collection of those local taxes.\u201d (emphasis added.)\nAn amendment to the proposal which would have returned the phrase \u201cgross receipts or any other special taxes\u201d to its form as originally proposed, \u201cgross receipts tax,\u201d was defeated by the Convention by a vote of four in favor of the amendment to 129 opposed. Id. at 703-04.\n. Id. at 705.\n\u201cDelegate Goldman. You do not anticipate that, by court interpretation, [the phrase \u2018or other special tax\u2019 would be construed as] meaning corporate net income taxes, corporate franchise taxes?\n\u201cDelegate Woodring. No, it is the intent of the committee that those are regular taxes and no [sic] special taxes.\u201d\nSee also 1 Debates 630-33 (remarks of Delegate Casey).\n. 2 Debates 1308-11.\n. Id. at 1325 (remarks of Delegate Woodring).\n. PURTA \u00a7 4, 72 P.S. \u00a7 3274 (Supp.1974) provides in part:\n\u201c(b) If in any calendar year [the total amount of taxes which local taxing authorities could have imposed] shall exceed the total amount of tax collected pursuant to [PURTA], the department shall determine the ratio which the amount of such excess bears to the total state taxable value of all utility realty reported to it pursuant to section 3(b). The department shall notify each reporting public utility of such ratio, and it shall be the duty of such public utility, within forty-five days thereafter, to pay to the state treasurer, through the Department of Revenue, an additional amount of tax equal to the product of (1) such ratio and (2) the state taxable value shown in its report required by section 3(b). ...\u201d\n.
