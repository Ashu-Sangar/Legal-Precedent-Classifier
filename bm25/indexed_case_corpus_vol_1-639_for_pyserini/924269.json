{"id": "924269", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe are satisfied from our examination of the testimony in this case that it was for the consideration of the jury, and if credited by them it was sufficient to overcome the presumption of payment. The case was carefully submitted to the jury under instructions which were unobjectionable. We find no error in either of the specifications and we therefore affirm the judgment entered on the verdict.\nJudgment affirmed."}
