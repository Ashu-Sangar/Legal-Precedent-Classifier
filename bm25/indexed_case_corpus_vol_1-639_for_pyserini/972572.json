{"id": "972572", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThe learned auditor has given sufficient reasons for awarding to the St. James\u2019 Episcopal Church at Evansburg, and to Christ\u2019s Church of Swedesburg, the legacies to which they were entitled under the will of Louisa Rittenhouse. The appellant claimed these legacies, although not entitled to them by the will, by virtue of an alleged agreement or comprbmise by which he was induced to withdraw his objections to the probate of the will. But he failed to show any valid agreement by which the church authorities agreed that he should receive these legacies.\nIt is true, a paper was produced purporting to be a minute of the vestry meeting of Christ\u2019s Church, by which it was resolved that the vestry \u201c decline to accept the bequest contained in item No. 6 of the will of the late Louisa Rittenhouse,\u201d etc. Bpt there was no agreement on the part of the vestry to give the legacy to the appellant. Moreover, it appeared that, when this resolution was passed, there was not a legal number of vestry-men present, and the fact that another member was subsequently, and not at a vestry meeting, induced to sign the paper, does not help the matter. The vestry-men of a church, as the representatives of a corporate body, must meet in order to take official action. They cannot act singly, upon the streets, or wherever they may be found. This is because they are required to deliberate. It is the right of the minority to meet the majority, and, by discussion and deliberation, to bring them over, if possible, to their own views. It also appeared that a subsequent meeting of the vestry refused to approve the minutes at the prior meeting above referred to.\nThe paper signed by certain members of the vestry of St. James\u2019 Church does not represent any corporate action, nor was it ever before a meeting of the vestry, except to be repudiated. It was, at most, a power of attorney, \u2014 not, as claimed, a submission or reference to an arbitrator, \u2014 and was subsequently revoked.\nThe appellant has not established a claim to either of these legacies. We think the costs were properly divided between the estate and appellant.\nThe decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
