{"id": "866817", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe find no substantial error in either of the rulings of the learned trial judge. He was clearly right in holding that the evidence was insufficient to sustain plaintiff\u2019s contention, and in directing a verdict in favor of the defendant garnishee. There is nothing in either of the specifications that requires discussion. Neither of them is sustained.\nJudgment affirmed."}
