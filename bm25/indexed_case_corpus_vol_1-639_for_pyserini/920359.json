{"id": "920359", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe report of the master and examiner approved and confirmed by the orphans\u2019 court, together with the decree of said court corresponding with and sustaining the same, constitutes a sufficient answer to the appellant\u2019s contention and renders extended discussion of the principal questions involved unnecessary. The argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel having been duly considered, and failed to convince us of error, it is our plain duty to affirm the decree.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant."}
