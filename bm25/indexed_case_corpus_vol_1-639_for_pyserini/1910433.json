{"id": "1910433", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThese are actions of trespass (which were consolidated for trial) for personal injuries and property damage resulting from an automobile collision which occurred December 11, 1962.\nSophie Tranter, plaintiff, was a passenger in an automobile operated by Anastasias Soldatos. This automobile was involved in a collision with an automobile operated by defendant Max Mandelbaum. Sophie Tranter and her husband, Wilfred Tranter, brought suit against Max Mandelbaum. Soldatos was joined as an additional defendant. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Sophie Tranter in the amount of $12,000 and in favor of Wilfred Tranter in the amount of $2,000 against defendant Max Mandelbaum.\nSoldatos instituted an action of trespass against defendant Mandelbaum. Mandelbaum filed a counterclaim. The jury returned a verdict of $15,000 in favor of Soldatos against Mandelbaum, and on the counterclaim found in favor of Soldatos against Mandelbaum.\nDefendant Mandelbaum thereafter filed motions for a new trial and for judgment n.o.v. These motions were dismissed and Judgments were entered on the verdicts. He thereafter appealed to this Court. His basic contention is that the verdicts were excessive and that this Court should grant a new trial or reduce the verdicts. The lower Court, in its Opinion stated: \u201cSuffice to say that we are satisfied these parties are, under the law, entitled to their verdicts.\u201d\nWe have carefully reviewed appellant\u2019s brief and have studied the record. We find no clear abuse of discretion or error of law which controlled the outcome of the ease. Zeman v. Canonsburg Boro., 423 Pa. 450, 223 A. 2d 728; Amon v.
