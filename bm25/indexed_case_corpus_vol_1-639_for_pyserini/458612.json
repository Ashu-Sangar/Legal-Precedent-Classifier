{"id": "458612", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the granting of a new trial because of the inadequacy of the verdict for $100 for the husband-plaintiff. Mrs. Taylor was a passenger in a car driven by Samuel E. Sweet, which came into violent collision with defendant\u2019s motor bus at a street intersection in Erie. The case was clearly one for the jury, as we decided in the opinion this day filed in the case of Sweet v. Rounds, 349 Pa. 152. The decision in that case controls this case for the attorneys for the defendants filed a stipulation that if this court decided that \u201cthe evidence was sufficient to justify submitting\u201d to the jury the question of defendants\u2019 negligence, \u201cthe lower court was correct in awarding a new trial\u201d because of the inadequacy of the verdict in favor of the husband-plaintiff.\nSince the actions of both husband and wife \u201cshall be redressed in only one suit brought in the names of the husband and the wife\u201d (Sect. 1 of the Act of May 8,1895, P. L. 54,12 P.S. 1621, and Rule 2228(a) of the Supreme Court Rules of Civil Procedure), and since this act is mandatory (Donoghue v. Consolidated Traction Company, 201 Pa. 181, 50 A. 952), it follows that a new trial must also be granted as to Mrs. Taylor\u2019s claim.\nThe order awarding a new trial is affirmed."}
