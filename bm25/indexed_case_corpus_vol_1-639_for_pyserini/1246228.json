{"id": "1246228", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Chidsey,\nThis case arose out of a railroad crossing accident. Plaintiff sued to recover for personal injuries sustained and damage to his Dodge pick-up truck when it was struck by a freight train on the eastbound main line track of the defendant, Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad Company, at the Sheridan Street grade crossing in the City of McKeesport. A jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $5,000. The defendant filed motions for new trial and for judgment non obstante veredicto. While expressing the opinion that it considered the verdict excessive, the lower court refused the motion for new trial because of its grant of the motion for judgment n.o.v. This appeal is from the judgment accordingly entered for the defendant.\nThe defendant railroad company maintains two sets of tracks which run east and west and cross Sheridan Street which runs north and south. North of the defendant\u2019s tracks but separated by a paved area about 30 feet wide, very much like a street, are three tracks of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company which also run east and west and cross Sheridan Street. The latter are protected by wooden warning gates which were open or up at the time of the accident. At about 6:12 in the morning of February 8, 1950 plaintiff was driving his truck southwardly on Sheridan Street toward the National Tube Mill, located south of defendant\u2019s tracks, where he was employed as a laborer. It was dark. Plaintiff testified that he intended to park his car in an adjacent area (also described as a street) between the defendant\u2019s tracks and the mill; that he stopped, looked and listened before crossing the Baltimore & Ohio tracks and that after crossing the paved area between the Baltimore & Ohio and defendant\u2019s tracks, again stopped, looked and listened before crossing the defendant\u2019s tracks; that he did not then see or hear anything; that he proceeded over the crossing slowly, about the speed that a man would walk; that when the front wheels of his truck had passed the last rail of defendant\u2019s second or east-bound track, he was struck by the eastbound train; that when his truck had entered upon the second track the cab of the truck suddenly became illuminated, that he then looked to his right and saw the approaching train 30 feet away. Plaintiff\u2019s case as to liability, that is as to the happening of the accident, consisted solely of his own testimony.\nThe day after the accident the plaintiff was interviewed at his home by a representative of the defendant and signed a statement, witnessed and first read to him by his adult daughter in which he admitted that he did not stop or look because the gates on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad were in the upright position and he thought it was safe to cross over all the tracks. Plaintiff\u2019s daughter, who was present when the statement was given and who read it to her father before he signed it, was not called as a witness to refute its content or to corroborate plaintiff\u2019s claim at the trial that he was too sick to properly narrate the happening.\nThe defendant called the engineer, fireman and trainman of the train. The brakeman was dead and the conductor ill at tlie time of the trial. The testimony of the three members of the train crew who testified, which was not shaken on cross-examination, was that the train, which consisted of the locomotive and tender and 35 or 36 freight cars, left McKees Rocks at about 4:30 A.M. en route eastward to Newell about 35 miles away, beyond the scene of the accident; that the headlight of the train was on from the time it left McKees Rocks until its arrival at Newell; that at least four blasts of the whistle were blown at the Center Street crossing which is about 50 car lengths west of the Sheridan Street crossing, that the engine bell was ringing automatically all the way to Sheridan Street and was turned off only after the accident occurred. It is not disputed that the train was traveling about 10 or 12 miles per hour, that the tracks are straight for a considerable distance on either side of the Sheridan Street crossing, that the view from the crossing westwardly, the direction from which the train was approaching, was about 1400 feet with no obstructions, and that the train stopped with the tank or tender of the engine upon the crossing. The engineer testified that he was on the right of the engine and therefore could not see the approaching truck, that he made an emergency stop when he was about 50 feet from the crossing because the fireman who was on the left of the engine told him to \u201cdynamite her\u201d. The fireman testified that he \u201chollered\u201d this to the engineer when he saw that the plaintiff was not stopping but proceeding across the paved area and onto the defendant\u2019s tracks.\nIn entering judgment n.o.v. for the defendant, the lower court held that plaintiff had not established negligence on the part of the defendant and also that plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. As to the defendant\u2019s negligence, plaintiff contends that the lower court erred in holding that plaintiff\u2019s testimony was negative and overcome by the positive testimony of defendant\u2019s witnesses, pointing to decisions of this Court holding that the rule relied upon by the court below does not apply where the negative testimony is that of a witness who for some reason had occasion to attune Ms faculties to the situation, that here plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of the crossing that he was about to traverse furnished a reason for looking and listening for approaching trains, and therefore his testimony that he did not see and did not hear can not be rejected under the negative testimony rule. On the other hand, defendant contends that, assuming there was a reason for plaintiff being attentive, under all the circumstances and plaintiff\u2019s own testimony he did not in fact alert his senses to the situation. We find it unnecessary to consider and discuss the issue of negligence thus raised for we are of the opinion that the lower court\u2019s action in entering judgment n.o.v. was fully justified on the ground of plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence.\nIn reaching this conclusion we have reviewed the testimony and treated all facts and reasonable inferences deducible therefrom in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. For this reason we reject from our consideration all evidence relating to the statement made by the plaintiff at his home on the day following the accident. While plaintiff\u2019s denial of the truth of its content was far from persuasive, we will treat it as sufficiently denied and consider the plaintiff\u2019s account of the happening of the accident as testified to by him at the trial. We first observe that he stated that he was familiar with the crossing, having used it and other nearby crossings of the defendant\u2019s railroad in order to reach the mill where he had been employed for six months, that he knew that whichever of these crossings he used he had to first cross the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tracks. He also affirmatively stated that he knew that the gates at the Baltimore & Ohio tracks protected only the Baltimore & Ohio crossing and did not protect the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie crossing. After testifying that he drove his truck southward on Sheridan Street and when close to the Baltimore & Ohio tracks stopped and listened, his testimony continues: \u201cQ. There was a gate at the B. & O. track? A. Yes. It was open. And when I stop and listen and look both ways I just pull ahead and that car was just making a turn before me over P. & L. E. tracks. When I come across the street [the paved area between the B. & O. & P. & L. E. tracks] I do the same; I look in both sides and listen. I didn\u2019t see nothing coming, no heard noise. I start across. As soon as I was \u2014 when I was on the middle of the railroad my cab was all at once on a shining like on fire, on shine. I throw my eyes on the side where light come from and train was right there. I didn\u2019t have time to do anything. They just smack me like this (indicating) and push me down on the railroad- \u2014 oh, I couldn\u2019t estimate; maybe about 200 feet. Q. Well, now, Mr. Jursic, was it light or dark at that itme? A. It was dark.\u201d. He further testified as follows: \u201cQ. And where was the train when you first saw it; how far away from you? A. When I saw that all shiny was in my cab. Q. Well, when you first saw that how far was the train from you if you saw the train at that time? A. Oh, that was about SO feet. Q. And how long after you saw that did the train strike your truck? A. It was just like this (indicating).\u201d.\nIt will be noted that while plaintiff testified that he stopped, looked and listened before starting over the crossing, conspicuous by its absence in plaintiff\u2019s account is any testimony that he continued to look or listen after starting across. Indeed Ms testimony permits only the contrary conclusion that he did not look after starting across until he was committed to the second track and then only when the train was practically upon him and after the headlight of the engine illuminated the cab of his truck. During the time that he proceeded upon and over the crossing he did not testify that the engine\u2019s headlight was not on or even negatively that he did not see it. He merely claimed that it was not on. His testimony in this connection is as follows: \u201cQ. Now, Mr. Jursic, I think you told us that before you were struck by the train that your whole cab was lighted up; is that right? A. That is right. Q. And your cab was lighted up by the headlight of the train, was it? That is what lit up your cab, was the headlight of the train shining into it. That is what lit it up; is that right? A. Yes. Q. So that the headlight of the train was on wasn\u2019t it; it was burning? Do you understand me? A. (No response.) Q. Do you understand me? A. I don\u2019t think. Q. Well, I want you to understand. I say that the headlight of the train was shining and the headlight of the train was on as it came down the track and before it hit you? A. Did you mean the train come down and just snapped the light on before? Q. No. I don\u2019t mean any such thing. A. Is that what you mean? Q. I certainly do not. A. That is exactly what I claim. Q. Oh, that is what you claim? A. Yes.\u201d. Claim is not proof.\nThe plaintiff was bound to proceed with caution after starting over the crossing. It was his continuing duty both to look and listen. In Kolich v. Monongahela Railway Co., 303 Pa. 463, 154 A. 705, this Court said at p. 467: \u201cIt was not sufficient that, before he started, he stopped, looked and listened, as he says he did several times, but he was required to look and listen, constantly and with the utmost care, until he had safely passed over the track (Tull v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 292 Pa. 458; Massinger v. Reading R. R. Co., 300 Pa. 6), the duty of constantly and carefully listening being as imperative as that of constantly and carefully looking: Rhodes v. P. R. R., 298 Pa. 101; Paul v. Phila. & Reading Ry. Co., 231 Pa. 338, 342. Plaintiff says he heard no bell ringing, whistle blowing, nor noise of any kind before he started to use the crossing; but he does not say that he did not see or hear anything after he started, nor that he was giving any attention to either matter before he entered on the track, though this was his imperative duty: Tull v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., supra. . . .\u201d.\nPlaintiff contends, however, that whether plaintiff continued to exercise caution when proceeding toward and over the crossing was for the jury, relying on language appearing in the recent case of Baker v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 369 Pa. 413, 85 A. 2d 416, in a discussion of the case of Muehlhof v. Reading Co., 309 Pa. 17, 162 A. 827. This language at p. 419 of the Baher decision is as follows: \u201c. . . The plain intendment of the ruling in the Muehlhof case is that where a traveler stops, looks and listens before entering upon a grade crossing and, neither seeing nor hearing anything approaching on the tracks, proceeds and is thereafter struck by a train on a track beyond the first, the question of his contributory negligence is for the jury. . .\u201d, citing, inter alia, Thomas v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 275 Pa. 579, 119 A. 717. The quoted language was appropriate to the Muehlhof case and to the Baher case. In the former there was testimony that the plaintiff was looking after he passed the first track of the crossing for despite a dense fog he saw the approaching train before the collision when it was 300 feet away. This required the question of his contributory negligence to be submitted to the jury. In the Baker case the plaintiff\u2019s decedent enjoyed the presumption of the exercise of due care, the train was going 65 miles per hour and there was a confusing background in the direction from which the train was approaching created by the lights of automobiles moving in the same direction as the train on the boulevard adjacent to and paralleling the railroad tracks. Decedent\u2019s contributory negligence was therefore held to be for the jury.\nThe language in question was not intended to mean that in all cases where a traveler has been injured beyond the first track of a crossing, his contributory negligence is for the jury. As stated in the Thomas case, supra, cited in Baker to the quoted text, in such case the traveler\u2019s contributory negligence is \u201cgenerally for the jury\u201d [emphasis supplied]. Where the negligence of the traveler after passing the first track is clearly manifest, especially by his own testimony, he may be declared guilty of negligence as a matter of law. Unquestionably such is the present case. It is difficult under all the testimony to believe that the plaintiff here looked and listened at any time before entering upon the crossing, but we are obliged to accept his testimony that he did. He was not required to stop again to look and listen while proceeding over the crossing, but he was under a duty to proceed with care: Baker v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, supra; Kolich v. Monongahela Railroad Co., supra. Whether plaintiff was looking straight ahead or possibly for a place to park in the area beyond and south of the tracks which was his destination, it is clear from his own testimony that he did not continue to look for approaching trains as was his bounden duty. He was .proceeding slowly, as was the train, which under his testimony must necessarily have been near at hand. If he had continued to look as he proceeded toward and over the crossing, he would have seen the train and could have stopped in time to avoid the collision.\nJudgment affirmed."}
