{"id": "1947028", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Cheep Justice Jones,\nOn December 12, 1968, appellant gave birth to Stephanie Watson at the Presbyterian Hospital in Philadelphia. Appellant was then an unmarried fourteen-year-old tenth grade student at the Gratz Neighborhood High School. The acknowledged father, who was sixteen years old on the date of the infant\u2019s birth, is Leon Yan Randolph, Jr.\nOn December 23, 1968, appellant relinquished custody of her infant daughter to the CMldren\u2019s Aid Society of Philadelphia. On April 7, 1969, appellant signed a petition for the voluntary relinqMshment of parental rights in the infant Stephanie. Appellant and her mother, Mrs. Janet Watson Bull, attended a hearing before the Honorable Hazel H. Brown on April 30, 1969, pursuant to the petition for relinquishment. Appellant and her mother each offered testimony attesting to an understanding of the relinquishment proceeding and the finality of their decision. 2The petition for relinquishment was thus granted according to the Adoption Act of April 4, 1925, P. L. 127, \u00a71.1, as amended, 1 P.S. \u00a71.1, repealed, Act of July 24, 1970, P. L. 620, \u00a7601,1 P.S. \u00a7601.\nFrom April 30, 1969, until January 1971, when appellant petitioned the lower court to vacate the decree of voluntary relinquishment, neither appellant nor her mother manifested any misgivings about the relinquishment decision. On January 26, 1971, appellant filed a petition to vacate the order of relinquishment. Judge Brown held an evidentiary hearing on June 30, 1971, and on November 3, 1971, entered an order dismissing the petition to vacate the decree of relinquishment. Denise Watson Randolph has appealed from the order dismissing the petition to vacate.\nAppellant questions whether the relinquishment of her child was a voluntary, intelligent and deliberate act and whether the procedure employed pursuant to appellant\u2019s voluntary relinquishment afforded her procedural due process guaranteed by the Constitution.\nThe Adoption Act applicable to the present case provides for the severance of parental rights in one of four ways: voluntary relinquishment prior to adoption, an abandonment decree prior to adoption, a judicial determination of abandonment at the adoption proceeding or adoption by consent of the natural parents at the adoption hearing. Act of April 4,1925, P. L. 127, \u00a7\u00a71.1, 1.2, as amended, 1 P.S. \u00a7\u00a71.1, 1.2, repealed, Act of July 24, 1970, P. L. 620, \u00a7601, 1 P.S. \u00a7601. In the case of a pre-adoption voluntary relinquishment, as here, the act mandates that if the mother of the illegitimate child is not eighteen years of age or over, the parent or parents of the minor mother must consent to the petition to relinquish parental rights.\nIt is appellant\u2019s position that, although she and her mother appeared to have assented to relinquishment, the necessary \u201cintelligent, voluntary and deliberate\u201d consent prescribed by the Adoption Act was lacking. Susho Adoption Case, 363 Pa. 78, 69 A. 2d 132 (1949). This Court in Susho, determined that the \u201cintelligent, voluntary and deliberate\u201d consent prescribed by the Adoption Act was lacking because the \u201c[natural mother] signed [the consent to adoption] when she was eighteen years and two months, at a time very soon after her mother\u2019s death, and while subjected to reprehensible coercion on the part of her brothers.\u201d 363 Pa. at 83, 69 A. 2d at 135.\nSusho stands for the proposition that an involuntary consent is no consent, and that it is appropriate under circumstances of vitiated consent to withdraw a validly executed formal instrument purporting to surrender parental rights.\nAppellant seeks to apply the Susho concept to the facts of this ease: appellant was fourteen years of age at the time of the relinquishment of her daughter; appellant lived in a foster home during the last half of her pregnancy because of her inability to co-exist with her mother during that period; and appellant was purportedly unaware of the alternatives to permanent relinquishment. The circumstances surrounding this voluntary relinquishment, however, do not indicate a vitiated consent by either appellant or her mother.\nAppellant was counseled by case workers of the Episcopal Children\u2019s Service throughout her pregnancy and during the period between her daughter\u2019s birth and the date of the voluntary relinquishment. During her last four months of pregnancy, appellant attended a high school accommodating only unwed pregnant young women. She was thus afforded ample opportunity to discuss her situation with empathetic persons. Testimony offered by appellant indicates that she is, and was at the time of the relinquishment decision, an intelligent and capable adolescent. There is no affirmative indication that appellant\u2019s relinquishment of her daughter was unintelligent, involuntary or unconsidered.\nDespite the congenital deaf-muteness of appellant\u2019s mother, her testimony at the April 30, 1969, relinquishment hearing, as translated, evidenced an intent to join in appellant\u2019s wish to extinguish parental rights in the infant Stephanie. Appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony at the June 30, 1971, hearing before Judge Brown, held in connection with the appellant\u2019s petition to vacate the voluntary relinquishment, evidences a change of position with respect to appellant\u2019s relinquishment decision, not a vitiated consent at the time of the decision: \u201cI thought the baby would be placed with a mother with a good income, with a comfortable home, and not with a poor person from bad surroundings. A person with money, a nice home and a place for the baby. I went to the hearing because I was expecting the baby to be placed in a good home. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nDespite the pathetic consequences for appellant, there is no provision in the former Adoption Act intended to accommodate the hindsight of the natural parent or her guardian. The prior Adoption Act prescribed that the court rendering a decree of relinquishment direct the transfer of custody of the child to the authorized agency and give authority to the agency to consent to the child\u2019s adoption \u201cwithout further consent of or notification to the parent or parents.\u201d Without such a proviso, the prospective adopting parents would have \u201cto assume the risk of a change of mind by the natural parents before the adoption could be legally accomplished. . . .\u201d Hildenbrand Appeal, 405 Pa. 579, 582, 176 A. 2d 900, 901 (1962). The express language of the former act and this Court\u2019s decision in Hildenbrand underscore the necessity for finality in the natural parent\u2019s decision to extinguish her rights in the once relinquished child.\nWe hold that appellant and her mother gave \u201cintelligent, voluntary and deliberate\u201d consents to relinquishment. That each has changed position does not permit us to disturb the finality of the initial decision.\nAppellant next argues that the hearing on the Petition for Voluntary Relinquishment violated her constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. It is urged that due process requires more than a \u201ctoken\u201d hearing and that appellant was denied her \u201cright to counsel\u201d at the relinquishment hearing.\nThe appellant\u2019s position is novel in that she attacks the propriety of the proceedings which she instituted for the purpose of obtaining the decree which she won, but noiv seeks to avoid. Though novel, appellant\u2019s position is without merit.\nAppellant\u2019s argument that the relinquishment hearing was lacking in due process is grounded upon the belief that the hearing was \u201ca very short one\u201d in which only \u201ca few routine questions were asked.\u201d Appellant proffers no examples of unexplored areas of necessary inquiry. Instead, she posits that \u201c[t]he colloquy [between the court, appellant and her mother] should have been longer and more detailed.\u201d\nAn. examination of the record of the April 30, 1969, hearing does not indicate a denial of due process. The court informed appellant of the consequences of her decision, questioned whether she understood the nature of relinquishment and inquired of appellant whether her decision was entered into uncoerced. Appellant\u2019s mother was similarly questioned. With her daughter translating, appellant\u2019s mother gave an unhesitating affirmative response to the question whether she consented to the permanent relinquishment of her daughter\u2019s parental rights. There is no indication that she did not comprehend the significance of her answer.\nAppellant asks that we extend the right to representation, afforded to juvenile defendants by In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1 (1967), to juveniles who are not criminal defendants, but who stand to forfeit \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d Gault extended the right to counsel to juveniles in \u201cproceeding[s] where the issue is whether the child will be found to be \u2018delinquent\u2019 and subjected to the loss of his liberty. . . .\u201d 387 U.S. at 36. Gault is inapposite in this setting. We are not compelled to afford juveniles the right to representation in civil proceedings by the authority of Gault.\nWe therefore find no deprivation of due process in the proceeding which formalized appellant\u2019s decision to extinguish her parental rights in the infant Stephanie Watson. However, we remand the matter to the court below to consider the impact, if any, of Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972). Bach party to pay own costs.\n\u201cThe Court : Do you realize if this petition is granted, you forever give up all your rights to the baby? Appellant: Yes. The Court : The Children\u2019s Aid Society will then have the right to place her in a home for adoption and when there is a hearing on that petition, they will have the right to consent without any notice to you? Appellant: Yes. The Court: And do you agree to that? Appellant: Yes. . . . The Court (to Mrs. Janet Watson Bull, appellant\u2019s mother) : Do you approve of having this baby placed for adoption? Answer : Yes.\u201d\nSection 1.1 of the prior Act providing for voluntary relinquishment read, in pertinent part, as follows:\n\u201cWlien any person under tlie age of eighteen years has been in tlie care of an approved ageney or institution for a minimum period of five (5) days, the parent or parents of such person may petition the court . . . for permission to relinquish forever all parental rights to such person. . . .\n\u201cThe court shall thereupon fix a time for hearing. ... At such hearing, the court, by examination under oath of the parties to the petition, shall ascertain the truth of the facts set forth in the petition and its execution, and if satisfied as to the truth thereof and that the petition should be granted, it shall issue its decree so finding, and (1) directing the transfer of the custody of the person to the approved agency or institution, and (2) authorizing such agency or institution to give consent to the adoption of such person without further consent of or notification to the parent or parents.\u201d\nThe procedure followed by the court below, pursuant to Section 1.1 of the former adoption act, is substantially reenacted in Sections 301, 303 and 321 of the Adoption Act of 1970. Act of July 24, 1970, P. L. 620, \u00a7\u00a7301, 303, 321, 1 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7301, 303, 321.\nAppellant and Leon Van Randolph, Jr., the father of the relinquished child, were married on September 18, 1971.\nThis matter was certified to us by the Superior Court, where jurisdiction to hear the appeal would otherwise lie.\nTiie recent United States Supreme Court decision in Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972), does not apply to this ease. In Stanley, an unwed father, whose children were declared wards of the state on the mother\u2019s death, attacked the Illinois statutory scheme as violative of equal protection where the children were separated from the unwed father without hearing upon the father\u2019s parental fitness. Since the unwed father here did not challenge the voluntary relinquishment procedure, we do not reach that issue."}
