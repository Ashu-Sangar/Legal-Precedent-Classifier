{"id": "1179644", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis is an appeal from the decree of the orphans\u2019 court dismissing a petition for review of an adjudication entered June 2, 1898. Over thirty-nine years having elapsed since the adjudication was entered, it is now too late to reconsider the questions there determined, in the absence of any showing of actual fraud: Elkins\u2019s Est., 325 Pa. 373, 190 A. 650; Knox\u2019s Est. (No. 1), 328 Pa. 177, 195 A. 28. The situation is not altered by the petitioner\u2019s disposition to call an alleged error on the part of the auditing judge a constructive fraud.\nAppeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s cost."}
