{"id": "12278582", "contents": "OPINION\nJUSTICE MUNDY\nIn this discretionary appeal, we consider whether a home rule municipality may amend its home rule charter to eliminate mandatory subjects of bargaining as defined by the Police and Firemen Collective Bargaining Act, commonly known as Act 111, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 217.1-217.10; the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 211.1-215.5; and applicable case law.\nAppellant, the Fraternal Order of Police, Fort Pitt Lodge No. 1 (\u201cFOP\u201d) is the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the police officers of Appellee, the City of Pittsburgh (\u201cCity\u201d), pursuant to Act 111 and the PLRA.\nThe FOP and the City are parties to a collective bargaining agreement that ran from January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2014. Section 18(S) of the agreement provides, in relevant part:\nIf, during the term of this agreement ... the Pennsylvania State Legislature enacts legislation relating to ... residency requirements for police officers in cities of the second class, the parties may reopen the contract to negotiate and/or arbitrate under these limited conditions. The Panel shall retain jurisdiction to address such issues if agreement cannot be reached by the parties.\nAgreement, 1/01/10-12/31/14, at 92.\nThe City is subject to the Policemen\u2019s Civil Service Act (for Cities of the Second Class), 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 23531-23540, which prior to October 24, 2012, provided:\nA person applying for appointment shall not be required to be a resident of the city at the time of application for original appointment. The person shall, however, be required to become a bona fide resident of the city at the time of the employment, and city residency must be maintained for the entire period of employment.\n53 P.S. \u00a7 23532 (repealed).\nHowever, the General Assembly repealed the residency mandate on October 24, 2012, through the enactment of Act 195 of 2012, which now provides, \u201c[a] city of the second class may require a police officer to become a bona fide resident as a condition of employment.\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 23532.\nIn light of Act 195, the parties met to bargain the residency issue. Because they were unable to reach an agreement, the arbitration panel was reconvened, and held hearings on June 28, 2013 and September 23, 2013. At the commencement of the first hearing, the City objected to the arbitrability of the residency issue. N.T. Hrg, 6/28/13, at 5. On July 29, 2013, the City submitted a brief to the panel on this topic. Meanwhile, on July 23, 2013, the Pittsburgh City Council passed a resolution to place a referendum on the upcoming general election ballot asking the voters whether the City\u2019s home rule charter should be amended to require all City employees and officials, including police and fire personnel, to maintain their domicile within the City. Voters approved the home rule charter amendment on November 5, 2013.\nOn March 14, 2014, the arbitration panel issued a Supplemental Interest Arbitration Award, which provided that the City-only residency requirement would immediately discontinue and be replaced with the following provision: \u201cOfficers shall be required to reside within a twenty-five (25) air-mile radius from the City-County Building.\u201d Supplemental Interest Arbitration Award, 3/14/14, at 4. One member of the three-member panel dissented.\nThe City filed a timely petition for review in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, seeking to vacate the supplemental award because the panel acted without jurisdiction and exceeded its authority under Act 111.\nWriting for the trial court, Judge Robert J. Colville noted that an arbitration panel may direct a municipality to do anything that it is lawfully empowered to do. Relying on Township of Moon v. Police Officers of the Township of Moon, 508 Pa. 495, 498 A.2d 1305 (1985), Judge Colville determined that residency is a term and condition of employment for police officers and is thus a matter within the jurisdiction and authority of an Act 111 arbitration panel. Because the Act 195 amendments placed residency within the City\u2019s control, an interest arbitration award could modify the residency requirement.\nThe trial court also rejected the City\u2019s argument that the interest arbitration award was unconstitutional because it required the City to act in a manner contrary to the amended home rule charter. Judge Colville noted that a home rule charter \u201ccannot supersede Act 111, a statewide statute.\u201d Trial Ct. Op., 7/9/14, at 10. In support of this conclusion, the court relied on Section 2962(c) of the Home Rule Charter Law, which provides that a municipality is precluded from exercising \u201cpowers contrary to, or in limitation or enlargement of, powers granted by statutes which are applicable in every part of this Commonwealth.\u201d 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2962(c)(2). The trial court noted that \u201cAct 111 is a statute applicable to all municipalities throughout the Commonwealth.\u201d Trial Ct. Op., at 11. The trial court further noted that Section 2962(c)(5) of the Home Rule Charter Law prohibits a home rule municipality from enacting \u201cany provision inconsistent -with any statute heretofore enacted prior to April 13, 1972 affecting the rights, benefits or working conditions of any employee of a political subdivision of this Commonwealth.\u201d 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2962(c)(5). Because the General Assembly enacted Act 111 in 1968, and it affects the rights, benefits and working conditions of municipal employees by allowing them to bargain or arbitrate to set the terms of their employment, the trial court concluded that the home rule charter cannot restrict the scope of collective bargaining issues under Act 111, including residency. Accordingly, the trial court affirmed the supplemental interest arbitration award.\nThe City appealed, and a divided en banc Commonwealth Court reversed. Writing for the majority, Judge Bonnie Bri-gance Leadbetter, noted that the General Assembly, through the Home Rule Charter Law, gave home rule municipalities broad powers \u201cto undertake any action they desired, and that such action should be upheld unless it was specifically denied by the Constitution, a statute or the home rule charter itself.\u201d City of Pittsburgh v. Fraternal Order of Police, Fort Pitt Lodge No. 1, 129 A.3d 1285, 1288 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2016). After observing that a home rule charter is the equivalent of a constitution, the court relied on Spencer v. City of Reading Charter Bd., 97 A.3d 834, 840 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2014) for the proposition that \u201cprovisions of a home rule charter have the force and status of an enactment of the legislature.\u201d City of Pittsburgh, 129 A.3d at 1289. The court concluded that no statewide law prohibits the home rule charter from requiring the City\u2019s employees to live within its borders. It explained that although Act 111 allows an arbitrator to impose any non-managerial conditions and conditions of employment, unless removed from discussion or award by other laws, \u201can arbitration panel can only award that which the public employer, in this case, the City, its Mayor and its Council, have the power to agree to and nothing more.\u201d Id. at 1290. Because the residency requirement is included in the home rule charter, which \u201chas the force and status of an enactment of the General Assembly,\u201d id., City officials lost the ability to bargain away residency requirements. Accordingly, the arbitrators\u2019 award would require the City to commit an illegal act.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the court partially overruled its opinion in City of Wilkes-Barre v. City of Wilkes-Barre Police Benevolent Association, 814 A.2d 285 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2002), in which it held that \u201c[w]hen Act 111 applies, neither a home rule charter, nor an enactment by a home rule municipality may change the ability to bargain about residency.\u201d Id. at 290. The majority faulted the City of Wilkes-Barre court for failing to recognize that a home rule charter has the force and effect of a state statute, thus superseding general Act 111 requirements for bargaining over terms and conditions of employment.\nJudge Robert Simpson filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Judge Kevin Brobson and Judge Anne E. Covey, noting that where a conflict exists between a statute of general application such' as Act 111 and a home rule charter provision, the state statute prevails. Judge Simpson observed that he would have reached this result even without City of Wilkes-Barre because the limitations placed on home rule municipalities by the Home Rule Charter Law, and the application of the principles of express preemption, indicate the General Assembly intended state statutes of general application to supersede inconsistent home rule municipality enactments. The dissenting opinion further stated that the majority erred by citing Spencer for the proposition that a home rule charter provision is the equivalent of a state statute. Rather, the dissenting opinion noted that Spencer held \u201ca home rule charter provision has the force and effect of an enactment of the municipality\u2019s legislative body.\u201d City of Pittsburgh, 129 A.3d at 1293 (Simpson, J. dissenting).\nWe granted allocatur to consider whether a home rule municipality may amend its home rule charter to eliminate mandatory subjects of bargaining as defined by Act 111, the PLRA and other applicable law, and whether a municipality\u2019s home rule charter provision eliminating a mandatory subject of bargaining for its police officers is preempted by Act 111. City of Pittsburgh v. Fraternal Order of Police, Fort Pitt Lodge No. 1, 635 Pa. 663, 139 A.3d 1257 (2016) (order).\nWe review an Act 111 interest arbitration award under a narrow scope of review, limited to (1) the jurisdiction of the arbitrators; (2) the regularity of the proceedings; (3) whether the arbitrators exceeded their power; and (4) whether a deprivation of constitutional rights occurred. Michael G. Lutz Lodge No. 5 v. City of Philadelphia, 634 Pa. 326, 129 A.3d 1221, 1227 (2015).\nThe FOP argues that the City is subject to several restrictions set forth in the Home Rule Charter Law, including Section 2962, which provides in relevant part:\n\u00a7 2962. Limitation on municipal powers\n(c) Prohibited powers.\u2014A municipality shall not:\n(2) Exercise powers contrary to or in limitation or enlargement of powers granted by statutes which are applicable in every part of this Commonwealth.\n(6) Enact any provision inconsistent with any statute heretofore enacted prior to April 13, 1972, affecting the rights, benefits or working conditions of any employee of a political subdivision of this Commonwealth.\n(e) Statutes of general application.\u2014Statutes that are uniform and applicable in every part of this Commonwealth shall remain in effect and shall not be changed or modified by this subpart. Statutes shall supersede any municipal ordinance or resolution on the same subject.\n53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2962(c)(2),(5) & (e).\nThe right of Pittsburgh police officers to engage in collective bargaining derives from Act 111, Section 9 of which specifically defines the scope of its application to include home rule charter municipalities.\nThe provisions of this act shall be applicable to every political subdivision of this Commonwealth notwithstanding the fact that any such' political subdivision, either before or after the passage of this act, has adopted a home rule charter.\n43 P.S. \u00a7 217.9. As such, the FOP asserts that Act 111 limits municipal powers as set forth in Section 2962 of the Home Rule Charter Law.\nHere, the Commonwealth Court majority recognized that the City\u2019s legislative authority is limited by Section 2962, but determined that residency is not specifically identified in Section 1 of Act 111 or any other statute. Therefore, it is not protected by the limitations on municipal powers set forth in the Home Rule Charter Law. However, the FOP maintains that the collective bargaining rights set forth in Section 1 are intentionally broad, and do not limit police officers to bargaining over specific topics such as wages or insurance. Section 1 provides:\nPolicemen or firemen employed by a political subdivision of the Commonwealth or by the Commonwealth shall, through labor organizations or other representatives designated by fifty percent or more of such policemen or firemen, have the right to bargain collectively with their public employers concerning the terms and conditions of their employment, including compensation, hours, working conditions, retirement, pensions and other benefits, and shall have the right to an adjustment or settlement of their grievances or disputes in accordance with the terms of this act.\n43 P.S. \u00a7 217.1.\nThis Court has held that \u201cresidency, as a legitimate condition of employment is within the scope of collective bargaining.\u201d Township of Moon, 498 A.2d at 1313. Accordingly, the FOP argues that by precluding bargaining over this working condition, the home rule charter amendment interferes with the officers\u2019 Act 111 rights. The City, as a home rule charter municipality, shall not enact any provision inconsistent with a statute enacted prior to 1972 \u201caffecting the rights, benefits or working conditions\u201d of its employees. 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2962(c)(5). All criteria are present here. First, Act 111 predates 1972, having been enacted in 1968. Second, it specifically created the right for police officers to bargain over and arbitrate for their working conditions. Third, residency is a working condition. See Township of Moon, 498 A.2d at 1313. Fourth, the charter amendment is \u201cinconsistent with\u201d the officers\u2019 right to bargain or arbitrate the residency issue. Therefore, the FOP asserts that the charter provision requiring domicile within the city limits violates Section 2962(c)(5).\nThe FOP further argues that the charter provision violates Section 2962(c)(2) of the Home Rule Charter Law, which prohibits the City, as a home rule charter municipality, from acting to limit \u201cany powers granted by statutes which are applicable in every part of this Commonwealth.\u201d Act 111 clearly applies in every part of the Commonwealth, providing officers with the power to bargain over and arbitrate working conditions. The charter amendment limited these powers by removing a working condition as a bargainable subject, and thus is contrary to Section 2962(c)(2).\nThe FOP further notes that the opinion of the Commonwealth Court fails to address the requirement of Section 2962(e) that uniform statutes of statewide application may not be modified. Because the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision permits a home rule charter municipality to divest officers of the right to bargain over a condition of employment, contrary to Section 1 of Act 111, the FOP asserts that the home rule charter amendment violates Section 2962(e).\nThe FOP also relies on Article IX, Section 2 of the Pennsylvania Constitution which provides, in relevant part:\nMunicipalities shall have the right and power to frame and adopt home rule charters. ... A municipality which has a home rule charter may exercise any power or perform any function not denied by this Constitution, by its home rule charter or by the General Assembly at any time.\nPa, Const, art. IX, \u00a7 2.\nThe Pennsylvania Constitution provides that home rule charters and amendments thereto are subservient to the limitations imposed by the General Assembly. Section 2962 of the Home Rule Charter Law, which provides that statutes of general application, \u201cshall not be changed or modified,\u201d is such a legislatively imposed limitation. Because Act 111 is a uniform statute applicable throughout the Commonwealth, the FOP maintains the home rule charter amendment that removes residency as a subject of arbitration is unenforceable.\nIn contrast to the FOP, and consistent with the Commonwealth Court, the City argues that adoption of a charter provision by the electorate is equal in force and effect to a statute. The City relies on In re Addison, 385 Pa. 48, 122 A.2d 272 (1956), appeal dismissed, 352 U.S. 956, 77 S.Ct. 353, 1 L.Ed.2d 316 (1957), where this Court stated, \u201ca constitutionally permissible adoption of a municipal charter is not one whit less in dignity than a statute of the legislature granting a charter.\u201d Id. at 276.\nThe City asserts that with Act 195 the General Assembly gave it the right to determine, as a matter of local concern, whether to impose a residency requirement on police officers. Once the home rule charter was amended to include a residency requirement, it insists residency was no longer a term or condition of employment subject to collective bargaining under Act 111. The following arguments raised by the City are all based on this premise.\nThe City notes that a home rule municipality \u201cmay exercise any powers and perform any function not denied to it by the Constitution of Pennsylvania, by statute or by its home rule charter.\u201d 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2961. It asserts that none of the limitations on municipal powers set forth above in Section 2962 of the Home Rule Charter Law restrict it from imposing a residency requirement for employees.\nAlthough the City recognizes that Act 111 is \u201capplicable in every part of this Commonwealth,\u201d 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9262(c)(2), it maintains that the residency requirement is not contrary to, and does not limit any power that Act 111 grants. The City relies on Washington Arbitration Case, 436 Pa. 168, 259 A.2d 437 (1969), where this Court held, \u201c[t]he essence of our decision is that an arbitration award may only require a public employer to do that which it could do voluntarily.\u201d Id. at 442. Here, the City argues the home rule charter residency provision, authorized by Act 195, did not contradict an Act 111 arbitrator\u2019s inherent powers, which are limited by what a public employer can and cannot do.\nLikewise, the City recognizes that Act 111, which was enacted prior to April 13, 1972, \u201caffect[s] rights, benefits or working conditions of any employee of a political subdivision.\u201d 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2962(e)(5). However, it maintains that the home rule charter\u2019s residency requirement for all City employees is not inconsistent with Act 111, and, as a legitimate act of a home rule municipality, is not prohibited under Section 2962(e)(5).\nThe City further posits the limitation articulated in Section 2962(e), that uniform statutes \u201cshall remain in effect and shall not be changed or modified by this subpart,\u201d 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2962(e), is inapposite because determinations about Act 111 bargaining obligations over a particular matter are case-specific inquiries. Borough of Ellwood City v. Pa. Labor Relations Bd., 606 Pa. 356, 998 A.2d 589, 598 (2010). It asserts that a change in a statutory scheme can create a managerial prerogative, authorize local action and thereby change bargaining rights about working conditions.\nThe City asserts that in 2012, when the General Assembly considered amending the explicit requirement of residency as a condition of employment, it could have retained the \u201cshall\u201d language mandating residency for police officers, 53 P.S. \u00a7 23532 (repealed), or deleted the \u201cshall\u201d provision without further amendment; or added, as it did, the provision, \u201c[a] city of the second class may require a police officer to become a bona fide resident as a condition of employment.\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 23532. The City maintains that under the controlling principles of statutory construction, the new language must be read as the General Assembly\u2019s grant of authority to the City to decide whether to require residency. The City argues that the General Assembly authorized it, and not an Act 111 arbitrator, to decide whether to require residency.\nThe City\u2019s position can be summarized as follows: where a home rule charter provision establishes a residency requirement, the subject of residency is removed from the collective bargaining requirements of Act 111. Essentially, the home rule charter transforms residency from a subject of bargaining into a managerial prerogative. Accordingly, the arbitration panel lacked the authority to order the elimination of the residency provision. However, the FOP suggests this position is untenable in light of the fact that resolution of this matter is grounded in Act 195, which amended the relevant section of the Policemen\u2019s Civil Service Act (for Cities of the Second Class) to provide \u201ca city of the second class may require a police officer to become a bona fide resident as a condition of employment.\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 23532.\nWe agree with the FOP that the provision of authority to a municipality to take action with regard to a bargainable subject, as Act 195 does here, does not give the municipality the ability to place those subjects out of the reach of an interest arbitration panel. In Chirico v. Board of Supervisors for Newtown Township, 518 Pa. 572, 544 A.2d 1313 (1988), this Court reviewed an arbitration award creating a disability pension fund benefit equal to 65% of an officer\u2019s final average salary. The Township appealed the award, asserting that such a benefit, which surpassed the 50% benefit applicable to regular retirements, exceeded the arbitrator\u2019s authority. The Court focused on the Municipal Police Pension Law, 53 P.S. \u00a7 767-778, which governs pensions for police officers in boroughs, towns and townships with three or more full-time officers. Section 771 of the Act provides:\nIn the case of the payment of pensions for permanent injuries incurred in-service and to families of members killed in-service, the amount and commencement of the payments shall be fixed by regulations of the governing body of the borough, town or township.\n53 P.S. \u00a7 771.\nThe Law vested the township supervisors with the authority to fix the amount and commencement of any disability payments. This Court held that the statutory language allowed the township supervisors to fix the disability pension benefit at 65% of final average salary if they wished to do so. Because the supervisors had this authority, the arbitrators also had this authority. Chirico, 544 A.2d at 1317. Contrary to Chirico, the City argues that the language permitting the City to establish residency restrictions converts residency from a bargainable subject into a matter of managerial prerogative. However, the new language of Act 195 recognizes the modification of residency as legal, by providing that the City \u201cmay require\u201d officers to become residents. Thus, where a municipality has the authority to set or not to set a residency restriction, the Act 111 interest arbitration panel has the same authority. Accordingly, the arbitration panel did not compel the City to engage in an illegal act when it modified the residency requirement.\nThe question of whether a topic is a subject of bargaining or a managerial prerogative under Act 111 was analyzed by this Court in Ellwood City, supra, where we concluded that a matter is considered a managerial prerogative where it is part of the public employer\u2019s \u201cessential managerial responsibilities,\u201d id. at 600, \u201csuch as decisions regarding the programs of the employer, standards of services, overall budget, use of technologies, organizational structure and selection and direction of employees.\u201d Id. at 601. Such functions are \u201cinherently managerial in nature.\u201d Id. A restriction on where police officers live is not an entrepreneurial topic. Township of Moon, 498 A.2d at 1313. Once a subject is deemed a mandatory subject of bargaining, it is only removed from the authority of an Act 111 interest arbitration where a statute has mandated a particular result. Id.\nWith the enactment of Act 111 in 1968, the General Assembly provided that police officers and firefighters have \u201cthe right to bargain collectively with their public employers concerning the terms and conditions of their employment.\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 217.1. To ensure that home rule municipalities would not abrogate this right, the General Assembly enacted Section 9 of Act 111, specifically providing that the act is applicable to every political subdivision in the Commonwealth, regardless of its adoption of a home rule charter. Consistent with Act 111, Sections 2962(c)(2),(5) and (e) of the Home Rule Charter Law place limitations on home rule municipalities. Section 2962(c)(2) precludes exercise of powers contrary to or in limitation or enlargement of powers granted by statutes applicable in every part of the Commonwealth. Because Act 111 specifically applies to every political subdivision, any act by a municipality that is contrary to Act 111 is prohibited. Although not specified in the statutory language of Act 111, our case law has clarified that residency is a mandatory subject of bargaining. Accordingly, the home rule charter provision requiring residency is at odds with an act of statewide application. Section 2962(c)(5), which prohibits enacting any provision inconsistent with a statute enacted prior to April 13, 1972 \u201caffecting the rights, benefits and working conditions of any employee of a political subdivision]!,]\u201d is implicated here because Act 111 of 1968 was enacted before that date, and affects the rights, benefits or working conditions of employees. As there is a patent inconsistency between Act 111, which provides for bargaining over residency, and the home rule charter provision that removes residency as a subject of bargaining, the home rule charter provision violates Section 2962(c)(5). In addition, Section 2962(e) provides that statutes that are uniform and applicable in every part of the Commonwealth shall remain in effect, and shall not be changed or modified. Because the home rule charter amendment changed or modified Act 111 by removing residency as a subject of collective bargaining, it violates Section 2962(e) as well. Thus, based strictly on Section 2962 of the Home Rule Charter Law, the FOP is entitled to relief.\nFurthermore, the right to engage in home rule flows from Article IX, Section 2 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which permits a home rule municipality to \u201cexercise any power or perform any function not denied by this Constitution, by its home rule charter or by the General Assembly at any time.\u201d Pa. Const. art. IX, \u00a7 2. In Spahn v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, 602 Pa. 83, 977 A.2d 1132 (2009), we noted, \u201c[t]hus \u2018by constitutional mandate the General Assembly may limit the functions to be performed by home rule municipalities.\u2019 \u201d Spahn, 977 A.2d at 1143-44 (quoting Ortiz v. Commonwealth, 545 Pa. 279, 681 A.2d 152, 156 (1996)).\nSpahn arose under the First Class City Home Rule Act, 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13101-13157. Like Section 2962 of the Home Rule Charter Law, which applies in the instant matter, the First Class City Home Rule Act provides, \u201c[njotwithstanding the grant of powers in this act, no city shall exercise powers contrary to or in limitation or enlargement of, powers granted by the acts of the General Assembly which are ... applicable in every part of the Commonwealth.\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 13133. Accordingly, this Court concluded that \u201clocal ordinances enacted pursuant to the local Charter are subordinate to the Home Rule Act when the matter at issue is one of statewide concern, and where the two conflict, then the subordination mandate of the Home Rule Act takes precedence and controls.\u201d Spahn, 977 A.2d at 1144.\nPursuant to Article IX, Section 2 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, home rule charters are subservient to limitations imposed by the General Assembly. Section 2962(e) provides that \u201cstatutes that are uniform and applicable in every part of this Commonwealth shall remain in effect and shall not be changed or modified.\u201d 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2962(e). Because Act 111 is \u201capplicable to every political subdivision of this Commonwealth,\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 217.9, the charter amendment modifying rights under Act 111 is unenforceable.\nWe also granted allowance of appeal to determine whether a municipality\u2019s home rule charter provision eliminating a mandatory subject of bargaining for its police officers is preempted by Act 111. As this Court noted in Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority v. City of Philadelphia, 627 Pa. 470, 101 A.3d 79 (2014) (SEPTA):\nIn a series of cases beginning with our decision in [Department of General Services v.] Ogontz [Area Neighbors Ass\u2019n., 505 Pa. 614, 483 A.2d 448 (1984)], this Court has held that a Commonwealth agency\u2019s challenge to a municipality\u2019s exercise of authority over it does not represent \u201ca contest between superior and inferior governmental entities, but instead a contest between two instrumentalities of the state.\u201d See Ogontz, supra at 452; County of Venango v. Borough of Sugarcreek, 534 Pa. 1, 626 A.2d 489, 490 (1993); Hazleton Area Sch. Dist. v. Zoning Hearing Bd., 566 Pa. 180, 778 A.2d 1205, 1210 (2001). That is, because the legislature authorized the creation of both entities, and set the limits of each entity\u2019s authority, our task is to determine, through an examination of the relevant statutes, which entity the legislature intended to have preeminent powers. Ogontz, supra at 452. In short, \u201c[t]he problem, essentially, is one of statutory interpretation.\u201d Id, Our standard of review of such a question of statutory interpretation is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. Hazleton, supra at 1213. As identified in Hazleton, our opinion in Ogontz, supra sets forth the analytical process a court is to follow to determine which entity the legislature intended to have preeminent powers over a given area of regulation.\nThe first step requires the reviewing court to determine, through examination of the statutes, which governmental entity, if any, the General Assembly expressly intended to be preeminent. Id. In the event there is no such express legislative mandate, the second step requires the court \u201cto determine legislative intent as to which agency is to prevail ... turning] to the statutory construction rule that legislative intent may be determined by a consideration, inter alia, of the consequences of a particular interpretation.\u201d\nHazleton, supra at 1210, (quoting Ogontz, supra at 455 (citing in turn 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(6)) (emphasis omitted).\nSEPTA, 101 A.3d at 86.\nExpress preemption occurs \u201cwhere the statute includes a preemption clause, the language of which specifically bars local authorities from acting on a particular subject matter.\u201d Hoffman Mining Co., Inc. v. Zoning Hearing Board of Adams Township, 612 Pa. 598, 32 A.3d 587, 593 (2011). Here, a review of the authority previously relied upon leads us to conclude that express preemption clearly applies in this matter. Section 2962 of the Home Rule Charter Law contains three explicit preemption clauses, see supra at 415-16, 161 A.3d at 165-66. Section 2962(e) prohibits home rule charter municipalities from taking any action that changes or modifies a uniform statute of statewide application. Section 9 of Act 111 makes clear that it is \u201capplicable to every political subdivision of this Commonwealth.\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 217.9. Furthermore, Section 2962(e) explicitly provides that \u201c[statutes shall supersede any municipal ordinance or resolution on the same subject.\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 2962(e). By including the word \u201csupersede,\u201d the General Assembly emphasizes that statutes of statewide application predominate over enactments of home rule municipalities.\nSection 2962(c) provides that a municipality may not limit \u201cpowers granted by statutes which are applicable in every part of this Commonwealth.\u201d 63 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2962(c)(2). Accordingly, the City\u2019s ability to remove a subject of collective bargaining created by Act 111 is preempted.\nSection 2962(c)(5) prohibits the enactment of \u201cany provision inconsistent with any statute heretofore enacted prior to April 13, 1972, affecting the rights, benefits or working conditions of any employee of a political subdivision of this Commonwealth.\u201d 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2962(c)(2). Public sector collective bargaining rights are set forth in Act 111, which became effective in 1968, and the Public Employe Relations Act (PERA), 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101.101-1101.2301, which became effective in 1970. Thus, the General Assembly has preempted home rule municipalities from undermining collective bargaining rights under Act 111 and PERA.\nAccordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court permitting a home rule municipality to redefine subjects of collective bargaining is contrary to Act 111, and therefore is reversed. The order of the trial court affirming the March 14, 2014 supplemental interest arbitration award directing that officers shall be required to reside within a twenty-five mile radius from the City-County Building is reinstated.\nChief Justice Saylor and Justices Baer, Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht join the opinion.\nJustice Todd did not participate in the decision of this case.\n. The Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law (Home Rule Charter Law), 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2901-2984, defines \"[h]ome rule charter,\u201d in relevant part, as \"[a] written document defining the powers, structures, privileges, rights and duties of the municipal government and limitations thereon.\" 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2902."}
