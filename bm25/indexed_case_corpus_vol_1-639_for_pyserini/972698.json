{"id": "972698", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThis was an appeal from the refusal of the court below to vacate an order previously made, amending the charter of the Blockley & Merion Turnpike & Plankroad Company. It was alleged that the amendment was improvidently allowed, inasmuch as it authorized the company to extend its road beyond the original termini. The power to amend charters of such companies is conferred by the act of June 4, 1879, when the Court of Common Pleas shall be \u201c of opinion that said alterations are lawful and beneficial.\u201d It thus appears that the court below had jurisdiction. Whether this particular amendment was \u201c lawful and beneficial \u201d we cannot now decide, as the matter has passed from our control. No appeal was taken from the order of the court below allowing the amendment within the time required by law. The appeal from the refusal of the court to vacate its order does not help the matter, as it would be doing by indirection what cannot be done directly. The appeal can only be taken from the original order, and the time for that has gone by.\nAppeal quashed.\nSee act of April 1, 1874, P. L. 50; \u00a7 8, act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 158."}
