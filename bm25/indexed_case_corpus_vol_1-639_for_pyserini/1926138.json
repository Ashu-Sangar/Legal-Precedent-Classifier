{"id": "1926138", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nAppellant\u2019s counsel in the Superior Court filed a brief which consisted of a xeroxed copy of a ten page \u201cbrief\u201d prepared by appellant himself. Counsel attached to this a memorandum requesting the Superior Court to \u201cperuse and consider said document with the same attention as if it were prepared by counsel learned in the law.\u201d Counsel also added a short \u201cfurther argument\u201d based on appellant\u2019s original uncounseled POTT A petition. The argument does little more than refer the court to several pages of appellant\u2019s hand-drawn brief and hand-drawn PCHA petition.\nThis is hardly the \u201crepresentation in the role of an advocate\u201d which we require. See Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 674, 675, 78 S. Ct. 974, 975 (1958); Commonwealth v. Stein, 436 Pa. 328, 257 A. 2d 848 (1969); Commonwealth v. Stancell, 435 Pa. 301, 256 A. 2d 798 (1969). Accordingly, the judgment of the Superior Court is vacated and the case remanded so that the Superior Court may consider the appeal upon the filing of a brief properly prepared by counsel. Commonwealth v. McFall, 436 Pa. 329, 257 A. 2d 847 (1969)."}
