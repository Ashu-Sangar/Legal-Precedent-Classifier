{"id": "998705", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis decree is affirmed on the legal conclusions of the learned chancellor below. The first and second sufficiently indicate the material facts upon which they are based, and the third is self vindicating. As to the fourth it need only be said that as Sarah McHendry occupied the apartment under a mere license, the proceedings before the alderman to dispossess her were within the provisions of the Act of March 31, 1905, P. L. 87.\nAppeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s cost."}
