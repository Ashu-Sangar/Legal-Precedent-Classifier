{"id": "482909", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, Simon Evans, was tried by a judge and jury and found guilty of murder in the first degree. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. This appeal followed.\nAppellant\u2019s conviction arose out of the murder of Mack Baker on January 7, 1972, in the City of Philadelphia.\nAppellant first argues that his oral confession should have been excluded because it was not preceded by proper Miranda warnings. We do not agree. Appellant was arrested on January 8, 1972, at about 7:00 a. m., by officers of the Philadelphia police. When police initially arrested appellant, they started to give him his Miranda warnings, but they were interrupted by the appellant, who stated: \u201cI know all that.\u201d After this interruption, appellant was transported to police headquarters. At this point, the failure of appellant to receive his full Miranda warnings did not prejudice him because he was not questioned by the police officers. After appellant arrived at police headquarters, he was given his full Miranda warnings, and questioned. He initially denied complicity in the homicide. He was thereafter reinterviewed and he gave an oral confession. Under these facts, the record supports the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the oral confession was preceded by full Miranda warnings and voluntarily given. See Commonwealth v. Parks, 453 Pa. 296, 309 A.2d 725 (1973).\nAppellant next argues that the court erred in allowing the Commonwealth to prove that appellant purchased heroin with the money he obtained in the robbery-murder of the victim, Mack Baker. The argument is based on the theory that this testimony related to other crimes for which appellant was not on trial and thereby prejudiced his case. This evidence offered by the Commonwealth was relevant and admissible to show appellant\u2019s motive and intent in the robbery and murder of the victim. See Commonwealth v. Faison, 437 Pa. 432, 264 A.2d 394 (1970).\nAppellant next argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because \u201cirreconcilable\u201d differences existed between himself and his attorney which prejudiced his defense. The record below is devoid of any factual basis for this assertion.\nAppellant next argues that he has a constitutional right to a pre-trial lineup and that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to conduct such a lineup requires a reversal of his conviction. We can find no support in law for this proposition.\nAppellant raises other allegations of error which we need not discuss, as they were not properly preserved for appellate review. See Commonwealth v. Clair, - Pa. -, 326 A.2d 272 (1974).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., concurs in the result."}
