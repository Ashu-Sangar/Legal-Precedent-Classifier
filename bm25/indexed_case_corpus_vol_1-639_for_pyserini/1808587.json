{"id": "1808587", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThis is an employment discrimination case brought under Section 5(a) of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(a). The Human Relations Commission found that Faith Hodge was discharged from her employment because of her sex. It awarded back pay and interest, entered a \u201ccease and desist\u201d order, imposed various notice requirements designed to apprise Hodge and other potential female applicants of positions, and instituted a reporting system to monitor hiring practices. Commonwealth Court held that the Commission\u2019s finding of discrimination was supported by substantial evidence and affirmed the order, 88 Pa.Cmwlth. 443, 489 A.2d 1001. We allowed the employer\u2019s appeal to examine the lower tribunals\u2019 method of applying the law in examining the evidence to reach a conclusion on the ultimate issue of discrimination.\nIn July of 1978, Faith Hodge took up residence at Second East Hills Park, a housing development in Pittsburgh. She had lived at Second East Hills until May of that year, when she left her employment as a City of Pittsburgh police officer in order to move to California. After her return, Hodge inquired of the resident manager of Second East Hills about a job as a security officer at the development. Hodge had known the manager from work with several community organizations around Pittsburgh. The resident manager, an employee of the defendant/appellant Allegheny Housing Rehabilitation Corporation, hired Hodge as a security officer in mid-August of 1978. Within a month he had assigned her additional duties and told her she was being designated \u201csecurity manager\u201d at Second East Hills. By letter dated November 2, 1978, slightly more than two months after Hodge had been hired, Allegheny Housing\u2019s Director of Management, the resident manager\u2019s superior, advised Hodge that her \u201cservices as Security Manager [had] been terminated due to the realignment of our security force.\u201d\nAllegheny Housing Rehabilitation Corporation is a limited profit corporation that manages non-profit and low income housing developments. In August of 1977, Allegheny Housing was hired as management agent of Second East Hills by the owner, Action Housing, which was at the time attempting to arrange a sale of the development. In 1978, Action Housing defaulted on its mortgage, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development assumed operation of the development as mortgagee in possession. Allegheny Housing was retained as the management agent by HUD. Pursuant to regulations governing developments where HUD was mortgagee in possession, in the summer of 1978 Allegheny Housing undertook the task of providing security services for Second East Hills within a budget amount imposed by HUD. Bids from several security firms were rejected as too high. Eventually, Allegheny Housing hired individuals as independent contractors to serve as security guards.\nHodge filed a complaint with the Human Relations Commission alleging that she was discharged from her job because of her sex. Section 5(a) of the Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(a) provides\nIt shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification ... [f]or any employer because of the ... sex ... of any individual to refuse to hire or employ, or to bar or to discharge from employment such individual, or to otherwise discriminate against such individual with respect to compensation, hire, tenure, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, if the individual is the best able and most competent to perform the services required.\nThe Human Relations Commission and the Commonwealth Court purported to follow the analytical model developed by the United States Supreme Court for Title VII cases in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), first approved by this Court for employment discrimination cases under the Human Relations Act in General Electric Corp. v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, 469 Pa. 292, 365 A.2d 649 (1976). That model sets out the nature of the evidence needed for the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case, for the defendant to respond, and for the plaintiff to counter the defendant\u2019s response. In Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981), and again in U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983), the Supreme Court addressed itself to the proper application of this analytical model. In particular, the Court clarified the nature and the extent of the defendant\u2019s burden of production. This case presents us with an opportunity to give similar guidance to the lower tribunals in our state system.\nIn McDonnell Douglas, the Court stated that the burden of establishing a prima facie case could be met by showing \u201c(i) that [the plaintiff] belongs to a racial minority; (ii) that he applied and was qualified for a job for which the employer was seeking applicants; (iii) that, despite his qualifications, he was rejected; and (iv) that, after his rejection, the position remained open and the employer continued to seek applicants from persons of [the plaintiff\u2019s] qualifications.\u201d 411 U.S. at 802, 98 S.Ct. at 1824. This standard is, to be sure, adaptable to accommodate differences in the nature of the discrimination alleged (e.g., sex rather than race) and in the action alleged to be improper (e.g., discharge rather than refusal to hire). The form it takes, however, must be appropriate to its function, which is to \u201celiminate[] the most common nondiscriminatory reasons\u201d for the employer\u2019s action. Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254, 101 S.Ct. at 1094.\nIn the Opinion accompanying its order, the Commission expressed the view that Hodge could meet her burden of establishing a prima facie case \u201cby proving that she was discharged for reasons not having to do with her performance, and that males were subsequently hired to perform essentially the same duties as she performed prior to her discharge.\u201d The Commonwealth Court offered a more specific statement of the elements: \u201c(1) she is a member of a protected class (female), (2) that she was hired for a job for which she was qualified, (8) that she was discharged, and (4) that she was replaced with one or more males with equal or lesser qualifications.\u201d 88 Pa.Comwlth. at 448-49, 489 A.2d at 1004.\nEach of these formulations in isolation might be considered flawed for failing to eliminate several common, non-diseriminatory reasons for discharge, the Commission\u2019s moreso than the court\u2019s. This \u201cflaw\u201d would become harmless, however, if the remainder of the analysis were properly applied to the entire ease. This is because the nature of the burden that \u201cshifts\u201d to the defendant when a prima facie case is established is simply to produce evidence of a \u201clegitimate, non-diseriminatory reason\u201d for the discharge. McDonnell Douglas, 411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824; see also Aikens, 460 U.S. at 714, 103 S.Ct. at 1481; Burdine, 450 U.S. at 254-58,101 S.Ct. at 1094-96; Board of Trustees of Keene State College v. Sweeney, 439 U.S. 24, 24-25, 99 S.Ct. 295, 295-96, 58 L.Ed.2d 216 (1978) (per curiam); Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 578, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2950, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978). If such evidence is presented, the question for the Commission is whether, on all the evidence produced, the plaintiff has persuaded it by a preponderance of the evidence that the employer intentionally discriminated against her. Whether the plaintiff must eliminate a certain non-discriminatory reason as part of making a prima facie case, or discredit the evidence of that same reason produced by the employer after plaintiffs prima facie case has been made, the result is the same; the plaintiff must persuade the factfinder by a preponderance of the evidence.\nThere is bound to be confusion where, as here, part of the employer\u2019s explanation attacks the plaintiff\u2019s qualifications for the job. If a plaintiff must prove a prima facie case by producing the evidence of her qualifications before the defendant is obligated to proceed with a defense, there will almost of necessity be, at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case in chief, evidence that she was qualified sufficient to avoid dismissal. At that point no evidence has been admitted on the other side. When the employer then produces evidence of disqualification, this could be understood either as an attack on the elements of the prima facie case, or as an attempt to meet the employer\u2019s burden of offering a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. Regardless of its characterization, however, its impact is the same. The employer, understandably, would prefer not to have to offer a defense at all until a more substantial case had been presented against it. Nevertheless, in the interest of having the ultimate question of discrimination resolved on the merits rather than for procedural failings such as lack of specificity, given the importance of circumstantial proof in such cases, it is appropriate to the remedial purpose of the Act that the prima facie case not be an onerous one.\nIt was never intended, however, that the previously described analytical method would immunize members of \u201cprotected classes\u201d from adverse employment decisions simply by dint of their class membership. Nothing about the Human Relations Act removes its operation from the bedrock concept of our jurisprudence that one who alleges wrongdoing must supply the proof. The stated analysis is no more than an aid to evaluating the proof. If the plaintiff produces sufficient evidence that, if believed and otherwise unexplained, indicates that more likely than not discrimination has occurred, the defendant must be heard in response. Absent a response, the \u201cpresumption\u201d of discrimination arising from the plaintiffs prima facie case stands determinative of the factual issue of the case. In other words, if the employer rests without producing evidence, the plaintiff must prevail if he or she has produced sufficient evidence to make out a prima facie case. If, however, the defendant offers a non-discriminatory explanation for the dismissal, the presumption drops from the case. As in any other civil litigation, the issue is joined, and the entire body of evidence produced by each side stands before the tribunal to be evaluated according to the preponderance standard: Has the plaintiff proven discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence? Stated otherwise, once the defendant offers evidence from which the trier of fact could rationally conclude that the decision was not discriminatorily motivated, the trier of fact must then \u201cdecide which party\u2019s explanation of the employer\u2019s motivation it believes.\u201d Aikens, 460 U.S. at 716, 103 S.Ct. at 1482. The plaintiff is, of course, free to present evidence and argument that the explanation offered by the employer is not worthy of belief or is otherwise inadequate in order to persuade the tribunal that her evidence does preponderate to prove discrimination. She is not, however, entitled to be aided by a presumption of discrimination against which the employer\u2019s proof must \u201cmeasure up\u201d.\nIt is obvious that Hodge, female, was hired and discharged. She testified to her educational background and the training she had received in becoming a member of the Pittsburgh police force. Payroll records of Allegheny Housing security personnel were also admitted into evidence to show the number of people working and the number of hours worked during the relevant periods before and after Hodge\u2019s dismissal. This evidence was, we believe, sufficient to put the employer in the position of offering a non-discriminatory reason for its action.\nAllegheny Housing, through the testimony of its vice president, supported by the deposition of the director of management, explained Hodge\u2019s dismissal as follows. While in the process of soliciting bids for security services for the development, Allegheny Housing was approached by certain residents of Second East Hills who were members of Certified Police Unit 644. C.P.U. 644 is a non-profit organization that functions as a hiring hall for individual security guards. Its members are all certified to carry firearms and have passed a psychological test administered by the state police. Unable to contract with a commercial security firm because of the HUD budget constraints, Allegheny Housing entered into an agreement with C.P.U. 644. Because HUD\u2019s involvement as mortgagee in possession was expected to be of short duration, perhaps several months, the agreement was not reduced to writing.\nUnder this agreement the security personnel hired as independent contractors by Allegheny Housing were to be drawn from the membership of C.P.U. 644. The actual hiring of individual guards was apparently delegated to the resident manager of the development. Despite the resident manager\u2019s awareness that only C.P.U. 644 members were to be considered, he hired Hodge, who was not a member, in mid-August, and later gave her supervisory duties over the other guards, who were all members of C.P.U. 644. When this hiring in violation of the agreement was brought to the attention of the director of management by members of C.P.U. 644, he discharged her. Thereafter a maintenance manager, a long time employee of Allegheny Housing who oversaw operations at a number of developments, was assigned the task of co-ordinating security services as well, encompassing the \u201csupervisory\u201d duties the resident manager had taken it upon himself to give to Hodge. This was the \u201creorganization\u201d referred to in Hodge\u2019s discharge letter.\nIf the allocation of proof analysis is properly understood, the foregoing must be considered sufficient evidence of a \u201clegitimate, non-discriminatory reason\u201d for Hodge\u2019s dismissal to meet Allegheny Housing\u2019s burden of production. Whether or not the evidence is ultimately deemed credible, and whether or not it ultimately withstands the weighing of all the evidence, it is indisputably sufficient to raise a question of fact as to whether the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee.\nReview of the Opinion of the Commission demonstrates that far from examining the evidence as a whole to decide the ultimate question of discrimination, the Commission, upon determining that a prima facie case had been made out, treated Hodge\u2019s evidence as established facts to be disproved, if possible, by Allegheny Housing. This approach is apparent in Conclusion of Law No. 8, where the Commission stated, \u201cRespondent has failed to demonstrate that its conduct in terminating the Complainant did not violate the Act. Its explanations for the termination were pretextual.\u201d Again, in its Opinion, the Commission stated, \u201c[i]f she makes this showing [of a prima facie case], Respondent may still prevail by showing that its conduct did not violate the Act.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth Court, having the benefit of Aikens and Burdine, recognized the error in this approach, characterizing it as coming \u201cdangerously close to shifting the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the employer\u2019s motives were not discriminating upon the employer.\u201d 88 Pa.Cmwlth. at 447 n. 3, 489 A.2d at 1003 n. 3 (emphasis in original). Nevertheless, the court\u2019s opinion showed the same mistaken approach to analyzing the evidence when, in dismissing a hearsay question as unimportant, it stated that Allegheny Housing\u2019s \u201cfailure to articulate a legitimate non-discriminatory motive for discharging Complainant obviated the need for Complainant to proceed with the ultimate burden of proving [the] intent to discriminate against her.\u201d Id. at 451-52, 489 A.2d at 1006 (emphasis in original). The court\u2019s emphasis on the word \u201clegitimate\u201d, coupled with its review of the Commission\u2019s findings that the evidence failed to disprove discrimination, betrays a hidden understanding that the probative value of the employer\u2019s explanatory evidence is to be independently weighed; if it is found to be somehow lacking, the explanation may be disregarded as \u201cnot legitimate\u201d, thus allowing the presumption arising from the prima facie case to stand as the only proof of the ultimate issue. As we have previously explained, this was error. Whatever additional information is imparted by adding the term \u201clegitimate\u201d to \u201cnon-discriminatory reason\u201d, the remainder of the Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of the employer\u2019s burden of production reveals over and over again that it cannot be given this effect. Especially where the prevailing principle is that non-contractual employment is \u201cat will\u201d, permitting discharge for any reason or no reason at all subject only to the requirement that it not be discriminatory, the test of the \u201clegitimacy\u201d of an employer\u2019s reason cannot be made so onerous. To hold otherwise would be to grant safe haven to \u201cprotected classes\u201d against adverse decisions not based on their class membership, protection not enjoyed by others and not intended by the Human Relations Act, whose purpose is \u201cto foster the employment of all individuals in accordance with their fullest capacities regardless of their ... sex ... and to safeguard their right to obtain and hold employment without such discrimination____\u201d Act of October 27, 1955, P.L. 744, \u00a7 2 as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7 952(b) (emphasis added).\nThe transcript of the hearing in this case displays a kind of gamesmanship played out between the parties (more precisely, their counsel), with a primary objective being the presentation of the bare minimum amount of evidence necessary to meet the burdens of proof as they were thought to exist under McDonnell Douglas and General Electric. Many witnesses whom it would be thought could offer important proof on behalf of both sides were not presented. Because the record is thus woefully inadequate and because the Commission erroneously subjected the employer\u2019s proof to a heightened level of scrutiny, we cannot be certain that its findings of fact were not influenced by its mistaken view of the law or that substantial evidence supports its conclusion. We accordingly vacate the judgment of the Commonwealth Court and remand the case to the Commission for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\nNIX, C.J., and LARSEN, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which PAPADAKOS, J., joined.\n. For purposes of this action under the Human Relations Act, Allegheny Housing concedes its status as \u201cemployer\u201d and the guards\u2019 status as \"employees\".\n. Because it deals with comparative qualifications, which is not an issue in all cases, the \"best able and most competent\" language of our Human Relations Act has been the source of considerable confusion. See Winn v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 506 Pa. 138, 484 A.2d 392 (1984) (equally divided court). According to one view, this language operates primarily in \u201cdisparate impact\" cases to establish a correlative of the \"business necessity defense\" found in Title VII cases. Its effect in \"disparate treatment\u201d cases, such as the present, is limited to allocating the burdens of proof in the same way as described in McDonnell Douglas, Burdine, and Aikens. See id., 506 Pa. at 146, 484 A.2d at 396 (Opinion in Support of Affirmance, Nix, C.J., joined by Larsen, J.); id., 506 Pa. at 157-58, 484 A.2d at 402-03 (Opinion in Support of Affirmance, Larsen, J., joined by Nix, C J.). Another view treats the language as creating an element of any cause- of action under the section, whether under the disparate impact or disparate treatment theory, and would assign the burden of proof as to that element to the plaintiff. See id., 506 Pa. at 159, 484 A.2d at 403 (Opinion in Support of Reversal, Flaherty, J., joined by McDermott and Zappala, JJ.). See also, Note, The Burden of Proof in Employment Discrimination Cases Under the Human Relations Act: The \"Best Able and Most Competent\u201d Clause Revisited, 58 Temp.L.Q. 307, 332-33 (1985). Here, the parties and the lower tribunals proceeded as though the \u201cbest able and most competent\u201d language had no effect on the McDonnell Douglas elements of either the employee\u2019s prima facie case or the employer's defense; the defendant has never contended that the plaintiff bore the burden of proving that she was \"best able and most competent.\u201d The focus of our review is limited to whether the McDonnell Douglas model, whatever the elements, has been properly used.\n. Though she was approached about joining C.P.U. 644, Hodge never completed the forms or took the necessary test; she testified that she was not told membership was a condition of employment.\n. There is, for example, an obvious conflict in the Commission\u2019s reliance on a document titled \"Security Force Policy\u201d, drafted after Hodge\u2019s discharge, to establish that the security supervisor\u2019s duties were identical to Hodge\u2019s duties, and thus discredit Allegheny Houring\u2019s contention that the resident manager had created the supervisory position and given it to Hodge without authorization. The same document contains an express statement that the employment criteria for security guards at Second East Hills were that they be \u201ccertified by the Pennsylvania State Police to carry a firearm, and have passed the psychological test administered by State Police.\u201d By her own testimony, Hodge met neither of these criteria at the time she was hired at Second East Hills, although she had weapons certification while she was a police officer. If the document is given credence and considered relevant to conditions at the time of Hodge's employment, the Commission would have to disregard substantial evidence to find that Hodge was qualified."}
