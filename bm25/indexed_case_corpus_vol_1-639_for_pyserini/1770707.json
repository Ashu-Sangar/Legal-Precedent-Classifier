{"id": "1770707", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court entered a decree terminating appellant\u2019s parental rights in her child. Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the decree. After carefully reviewing the record, we find appellant\u2019s contention to be without merit. Appellant\u2019s continued incapacity has caused her child to be without essential parental care and such incapacity cannot or will not be remedied. See In re William L., 477 Pa. 322, 383 A.2d 1228 (1978), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 880, 99 S.Ct. 217, 58 L.Ed.2d 192 (1978); 1 P.S. \u00a7 311(2). The determination of the Orphans\u2019 Court is supported by competent evidence and will not be reversed. See In re J. L. Z., 7 Pa. 492, 421 A.2d 1064 (1980).\nDecree affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion."}
