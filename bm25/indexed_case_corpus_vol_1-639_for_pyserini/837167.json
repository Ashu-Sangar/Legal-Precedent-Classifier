{"id": "837167", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Chief Justice.\nThe issue raised in this case is whether prospective adoptive parents, who have had the child in their care and custody for nine or ten months following her birth, may intervene in a custody proceeding brought by the child\u2019s natural father, who is seeking custody of the child, when the natural mother has placed the child in the prospective adoptive parents\u2019 custody and favors their adoption of the child.\nThe child, M, was born out of wedlock on January 4, 1996. Her parents, E and A, were school children aged sixteen and eighteen respectively, living with their parents. During the later stages of her pregnancy, E took up residence in Genesis House in Pittsburgh, a facility which is operated by Genesis of Pittsburgh, an adoption agency for women who intend to place their child for adoption. The day after the child was bom, E executed a document granting custody of the child to Genesis and allowed it to seek adoptive parents for the child. Genesis immediately placed the child with D and C, the prospective adoptive parents. The child has remained with these prospective adoptive parents since that time. E executed a consent to the adoption and a similar consent was forwarded to A, who refused to consent.\nD and C initiated an adoption proceeding, the status of which is currently uncertain, and on February 26, 1996, A and his mother filed a complaint for primary physical custody. D and C filed a motion to intervene, and on July 9,1996, the trial court granted their motion on the grounds that they stood in loco parentis to the child. The trial court heard testimony on the issue of custody, and on November 13, 1996 awarded primary physical custody to D and C. A and his mother appealed.\nSuperior Court affirmed, holding that the natural mother\u2019s decision to grant custody to the Genesis agency, who in turn granted it to D and C, conferred upon D and C in loco parentis status, and that considering the child\u2019s physical, intellectual, moral and spiritual well-being, the trial court did not err in awarding custody to D and C.\nThe issue in this appeal from the decision of Superi- or Court is whether it was error to allow the prospective adoptive parents the right to intervene by conferring upon them in loco parentis status. Normally, a third party may challenge custody only through dependency proceedings. The Juvenile Act, which governs dependency proceedings, defines a dependent child, inter alia, as \u201cA child who is without proper parental care or control, subsistence, education as required by law, or other care or control necessary for his physical, mental or emotional health, or morals.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6302. In other words, in order for a third party to interfere in a natural parent\u2019s custody of his child, the third party would have to show in a dependency proceeding that the child is not properly cared for. If the third party were able to prevail on that issue, then the third party could intervene in a custody proceeding. As Superior Court stated in Cardamone v. Elshoff, 442 Pa.Super. 263, 659 A.2d 575 (1995): \u201c[UJnless the natural parents\u2019 prima facie right to custody is successfully overcome via the dependency proceedings, this court cannot confer standing upon third parties to interfere with the parent child relationship.\u201d 659 A.2d at 581.\nAn exception to this rule is that where the third parties stand in loco parentis, i.e., where the third parties have \u201cassumed obligations incident to the parental relationship,\u201d id., the third party may intervene in a custody proceeding. However, \u201ca third party cannot place himself in loco parentis in defiance of the parents\u2019 wishes and the parent/child relationship.\u201d Gradwell v. Strausser, 416 Pa.Super. 118, 610 A.2d 999, 1003 (1992).\nThe record in this case establishes that A attempted to gain custody of his child from shortly after the child was born until the present. He opposes the adoption and he seeks custody of the child himself. It is plain that D and C retain custody of his child in defiance of his wishes. The lower courts were in error, therefore, in conferring standing upon the prospective adoptive parents.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed and the trial court\u2019s order granting custody to D and C is vacated. The ease is remanded for a hearing on the custody petition filed by A and his mother.\nJustice NIGRO files a concurring opinion, joined by Justice SAYLOR, who also joins the majority opinion.\nJustice ZAPPALA files a dissenting opinion.\nJustice NEWMAN files a dissenting opinion that is joined by Justice CASTILLE.\n. In Rowles v. Rowles, 542 Pa. 443, 668 A.2d 126 (1995) a plurality of this court would have abandoned the presumption that parents have a right to custody of their children as against third parties. In its place, the plurality suggested \"weighing parenthood as a strong factor for consideration.\u201d 668 A.2d at 128. In suggesting this change in terminology from \u201cpresumption\u201d to \"weighing parenthood as a strong factor,\u201d however, the plurality observed:\nIn Ellerbe [v. Hooks, 490 Pa. 363, 416 A.2d 512 (Pa.1980)], both opinions, representing all seven justices, agreed on several principles: \"the parent-child relationship should be considered to be of importance in determining which custody arrangement is in the child\u2019s best interest,\u201d \"special weight\u201d and \"deference\u201d should be accorded the parent-child relationship, and the relationship should not be disturbed \"without some showing of harm\u201d or unless circumstances \"clearly indicate the appropriateness of awarding custody to a non-parent.\u201d Id., 490 Pa. at 366, 369, 370, 373, 416 A.2d at 513, 514, 515, 516-17. We adhere to these principles, for, in general, parents have a deep, abiding commitment to the well-being of their children.\n668 A.2d at 128 (emphasis added). Because the Rowles opinion did not command a majority of the court, the presumption that parents have a right to the custody of their children as against third parties remains in effect. Whether the parents\u2019 interest in their children is referred to as a presumption or as a factor to be weighed, however, the main idea is that parents are to receive special consideration: as the court put it in Eilerbe, special weight and deference should be accorded the parent-child relationship."}
