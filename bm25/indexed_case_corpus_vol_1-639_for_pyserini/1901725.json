{"id": "1901725", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThis appeal arises from the dismissal, without hearing, of appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We are of the view that the petition is without merit and affirm the action of the court below.\nIn his petition for habeas corpus, appellant challenges his conviction on the ground, inter alia, that his conviction of murder in the second degree, following the entry of a plea of guilty to the charge of murder generally, was a nullity by reason of his failure to execute a written waiver of a jury trial.\nThe record discloses that appellant was brought to trial on a bill of indictment charging murder. During the course of voir dire, counsel for appellant informed the court that appellant desired to change his plea and requested leave to enter a plea of guilty. The trial judge thereupon examined appellant and, having satisfied himself that the plea was voluntarily and understandingly made, permitted the plea to be entered. A hearing was held to determine the degree of guilt and appellant was adjudged guilty of murder in the second degree and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 to 20 years.\nIn considering appellant\u2019s contention that the failure to execute a written waiver of jury nullified the proceedings leading to his conviction, we start with the proposition that a plea of guilty to a criminal charge, once accepted and entered by the court, is deemed a confession of guilt. Commonwealth ex rel. Crosby v. Rundle, 415 Pa. 81, 86, 202 A. 2d 299, 302 (1964); cf. Commonwealth v. Simmons, 361 Pa. 391, 402, 65 A. 2d 353, 358-59 (1949). Accordingly, under Section 701 of The Penal Code of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, 18 P.S. \u00a74701, the degree of guilt, following the entry of a plea of guilty to the charge of murder generally, is determined by the court, not a jury. Commonwealth v. Cole, 384 Pa. 40, 46, 119 A. 2d 253, 256 (1956). Thus, in the instant case, no written waiver of jury was required, since the effect of appellant\u2019s guilty plea was to remove the need for and appellant\u2019s right to trial by jury. Commonwealth ex rel. Crosby v. Rundle, supra; Commonwealth v. Kirkland, 413 Pa. 48, 53, 195 A. 2d 338, 340 (1963); Commonwealth v. Cole, 384 Pa. 40, 46, 119 A. 2d 253, 256 (1956); cf. Commonwealth ex rel. v. Ashe [sic], 44 Pa. D. & C. 337, 339-41 (O. & T. Juniata Co. 1942).\nAppellant also challenges the validity of the guilty plea on the ground that it was not personally endorsed upon the bill of indictment. As this Court has previously held, appellant\u2019s signature to the plea, upon the bill of indictment, while desirable, is not indispensable to the validity of the plea. Commonwealth ex rel. Stepper v. Banmiller, 393 Pa. 1, 3-4, 141 A. 2d 573, 575, cert. denied, 358 U.S. 868, 79 S. Ct. 100 (1958); Commonwealth ex rel. Gibbs v. Ashe, 165 Pa. Superior Ct. 35, 38, 67 A. 2d 773, 774, cert. denied, 338 U.S. 880, 70 S. Ct. 151 (1949). The record discloses that appellant, in open court and in the presence of his counsel, entered his plea of guilty to the murder indictment. Under such circumstances, appellant\u2019s failure to endorse the indictment may not impeach the validity of the plea. Cf. Commonwealth ex rel. Stepper v. Banmiller, supra.\nWe have examined the other contentions advanced by appellant and find them equally without merit. Order affirmed.\nMr. Justice Cohen took no part in the consideration or decision of this case."}
