{"id": "1769081", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nAppellant, Alexander Shields, appeals from judgments of sentence entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia following convictions for murder of the second degree, rape, statutory rape, and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse.\nAppellant raises two assignments of error in the instant direct appeal: (1) that the convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence, including an assertion that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence contained an inconsistency; and (2) that appellant was so mentally deficient as to have been incapable of effectively waiving his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). After a thorough review of the briefs and record in this case, we have concluded that appellant\u2019s contentions are without merit.\nJudgments of sentence affirmed."}
