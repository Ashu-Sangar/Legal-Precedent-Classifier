{"id": "1761078", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant American Bank and Trust Company of Pennsylvania is the guardian of the estate of incompetent Edward J. Damario, III. Appellant challenges the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County directing the estate to reimburse the County of Berks for funds expended by the county for the defense of Damario in a murder prosecution. We hold that the decree of reimbursement on this record is proper and therefore affirm.\nEdward J. Damario, III, was charged with the murder of his parents Assunta and Edward J. Damario. On Damario\u2019s affidavit attesting to indigency, the county appointed counsel for Damario. Damario was then tried in the Criminal Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County. On June 13, 1975, a jury returned a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.\nFollowing trial, Damario was adjudicated incompetent in the orphans\u2019 court division and appellant was appointed guardian of his estate. Because Damario was adjudged not guilty by reason of insanity, his estate was not precluded under the Slayer\u2019s Act from inheriting from his parents\u2019 estates. Shortly thereafter, the sum of $8,359.74 was distributed to the appellant-guardian by the administrator of the estate of Damario\u2019s mother.\nOn November 3, 1976, a petition was filed by Berks County, requesting that a citation be issued to appellant-guardian for reimbursement of $3,471.99, representing funds expended by the county for the defense of Damario. Appellant filed preliminary objections to the petition, alleging lack of statutory or decisional authority for such an order. The orphans\u2019 court division directed reimbursement, finding that the services provided and paid for by the county \u201cwere rendered from a proper motive and under circumstances indicative of good faith.\u201d The court also found that the expenses for his defense were \u201cproperly chargeable to the estate of the [incompetent] in a reasonable amount,\u201d and that the amount charged \u201cis a reasonable compensation for the services supplied.\u201d Exceptions were dismissed on December 2, 1977 and this appeal followed.\nThere is no question that Damario was constitutionally entitled to court-appointed counsel. See, Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963); Commonwealth v. Ritchey, 431 Pa. 269, 245 A.2d 446 (1968); Pa.R.Crim.P. 316. Counsel was properly furnished to the accused at county expense. This expenditure of public funds was for the individual benefit of Damario.\nThe factual circumstances here present us with an issue of first impression. The precise question to be decided is whether the orphans\u2019 court, in its equitable discretion, properly directed reimbursement from Damario\u2019s estate out of the inherited funds which became available to his estate after the murder trial. It must be remembered that in reviewing the orphans\u2019 court decision, \u201cour task is to assure that the record is free from legal error and to determine if the chancellor\u2019s findings are supported by competent and adequate evidence, and are not predicated upon capricious disbelief of competent and credible evidence.\u201d McCrea Estate, 475 Pa. 383, 386-87, 380 A.2d 773, 775 (1977); Cohen Will, 445 Pa. 549, 550, 284 A.2d 754, 755 (1971); Holtz Will, 422 Pa. 540, 544, 222 A.2d 885, 888 (1966).\nThe orphans\u2019 court has \u201call legal and equitable powers required for or incidental to the exercise of its jurisdiction,\u201d Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, \u00a7 2, 42 Pa.C.S.A. 323. We are satisfied that this broad grant of judicial authority vests in the orphans\u2019 court the power to order reimbursement in appropriate circumstances.\nRequiring reimbursement where, as here, the accused is so soon after the jury\u2019s verdict, not indigent, is not unreasonable or unfair. Indeed the fairness and propriety of directing repayment of the funds the county expended on Damario\u2019s behalf is most convincingly stated by the Supreme Court of the United States:\n\u201cWe live in a society where the distribution of legal assistance, like the distribution of all goods and services, is generally regulated by the dynamics of private enterprise. A defendant in a criminal case who is just above the line separating the indigent from the nonindigent must borrow money, sell off his meager assets, or call upon his family or friends in order to hire a lawyer. We cannot say that the Constitution requires that those only slightly poorer must remain forever immune from any obligation to shoulder the expenses of their legal defense, even when they are able to pay without hardship.\u201d\nFuller v. Oregon, 417 U.S. 40, 54, 94 S.Ct. 2116, 2124-25, 40 L.Ed.2d 642 (1974). Mandating repayment of the public funds expended for the personal benefit of Damario, from assets available for his use, embodies the basic elements of fairness in the allocation of individual and governmental obligations and resources. Denying reimbursement in the circumstances of this case would serve no individual or societal interest of justice. Similarly, a New Jersey court recently held in a \u201cquasi-criminal proceeding\u201d that a \u201cpublic entity bearing the costs of the defense may make a timely application for reimbursement of such costs,\u201d and a court has \u201cinherent power to order reimbursement,\u201d M. v. S., 169 N.J.Super. 209, 404 A.2d 653, 657 (1979).\nDirecting reimbursement for the expenditure of public funds is not unknown in Pennsylvania jurisprudence. As long ago as Waits Estate, 336 Pa. 151, 7 A.2d 329 (1939), this Court stated that the common law implies a duty on the part of a recipient of public assistance to make reimbursement if able to do so. See also Reiver\u2019s Estate, 343 Pa. 137, 22 A.2d 655 (1941) (implied duty to reimburse public assistance payments when financially able to do so).\nHere, the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s equitable discretion was soundly exercised. The court did not speculate that Damario\u2019s estate might receive funds in the future. Instead, the court\u2019s determination was based on existing assets of the estate, including assets inherited from the estate of Damario\u2019s mother immediately following the jury\u2019s verdict. The court properly exercised its discretion in granting the county\u2019s petition for reimbursement, where the petition was filed within a reasonable period after the services were supplied. So too the court\u2019s reimbursement order was proper in that it directed payment of a sum certain, in full satisfaction of the county\u2019s claim. See generally, S. Krantz, C. Smith, D. Rossman, P. Froyd, & J. Hoffman, Right to Counsel in Criminal Cases, 340-347 (1976) (reimbursement should be timely requested and for a fixed sum). It is agreed that the county sought an amount correctly and reasonably reflecting the costs of defense services provided. There is no claim that the amount directed to be paid to the county will impose hardship or unduly burden the estate. Cf. United States v. Bracewell, 569 F.2d 1194 (2d Cir. 1978) (\u201cavailability\u201d requirement under federal reimbursement statute, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 30Q6A(f) (1969), necessitates determination of defendant\u2019s ability to pay); see also M. v. S., supra, n. 4.\nThe orphans\u2019 court correctly adjudicated the county's claim against Damario\u2019s solvent estate for funds expanded for his personal benefit. Indeed, the orphans\u2019 court closely scrutinized all relevant factors here, since Damario is incompetent and his estate may be charged only for \u201cnecessaries\u201d provided on his behalf. See Arnold\u2019s Estate, 253 Pa. 517, 98 A. 701 (1916); Weightman\u2019s Estate, 126 Pa.Super. 221, 190 A. 552 (1937).\nReview of the record reveals no error of law, abuse of discretion or any other basis for disturbing the adjudication of the orphans\u2019 court. Accordingly, the decree directing reimbursement to the county is affirmed.\nDecree affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nEAGEN, C. J., and LARSEN, J., concur in the result.\n. Damario\u2019s right to inherit was subject to the limitations imposed by the Slayer\u2019s Act of June 30, 1972, P.L. 508, 20 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8801, et seq. \u201c[A]ny person who participates ... in the wilful and unlawful killing of any other person\u201d cannot \u201cin any way acquire any property or receive any benefit as the result of the death of the decedent.\u201d\n. Damario inherited from the estate of his mother, who was determined to have survived his father.\n. While there are cases which have invalidated orders for reimbursement for lack of express statutory authority, Commonwealth v. Terry, 470 Pa. 234, 368 A.2d 279 (1977), Commonwealth v. Opara, 240 Pa.Super. 511, 362 A.2d 305 (1976), these orders were entered by sentencing courts and are therefore inapposite here. The case before us involves a separate civil action instituted by the county, brought before the orphans\u2019 court having broad jurisdiction over Damario\u2019s estate.\nWe are also not persuaded by appellant\u2019s contention that the Act of March 31, 1860, P.L. 427, as amended, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1351, (now replaced by Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, \u00a7 2, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1722(a), 1726), prohibits reimbursement here. The statute provided that the costs of prosecution must be paid by the county where a defendant is found not guilty by reason of insanity. Here, however, the costs of prosecution were not part of the reimbursement order. Rather, reimbursement was sought by and granted to the county for the expenses of Damario\u2019s defense.\n. In M. v. S., an indigent defendant in a paternity action was provided with appointed counsel. It was held that a court could order reimbursement, without express statutory authority to do so, so long as several procedural safeguards were observed. These safeguards included: (1) insuring that only individuals who could repay without \u201cmanifest hardship\u201d would be obligated to reimburse, (2) an opportunity for defendant to contest the value of the services would be provided, and (3) the reimbursement debt would be subject to the same protective exemptions available to other civil judgment debtors.\n. Appellant\u2019s contention that the order of reimbursement violates his constitutional rights must also be dismissed. The argument that a defendant may decline appointed counsel if he knows he may be required to reimburse, thus \u201cchilling\u201d his constitutional right to counsel, has' been rejected in Fuller v. Oregon, supra, 417 U.S. at 53-55, 94 S.Ct. at 2124-2125. There is also no merit to the claim that appellant was denied due process of law due to lack of guidelines for reimbursement determinations. Here the court of equity closely scrutinized the amount charged for the services and found it to be reasonable, and we find no reason for disturbing the court\u2019s result."}
