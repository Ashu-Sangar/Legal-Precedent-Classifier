{"id": "466652", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Chief Justice.\nLouis Pertile was employed as a nuclear inspector for Construction Engineering Consultants, Inc. (the employer) when he suffered a work-related injury. The employer accepted liability for the injury and issued a notice of compensation payable dated August 5, 1987 for weekly benefits of $236.00. Subsequently the employer filed a petition for modification alleging that Pertile had refused to apply for or accept alternative employment compatible with the limitations arising from his injury.\nAfter hearing, the workmen\u2019s compensation referee found that Pertile had refused to apply for work to which Construction Engineering\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier had referred him and granted the employer\u2019s petition to modify compensation. Pertile appealed. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board affirmed the referee.\nCommonwealth Court reversed, holding that the employer had produced no evidence which established that Pertile failed to apply for work. We granted allocatur to address the propriety of Commonwealth Court\u2019s ruling.\nFirst, we note that the scope of inquiry in workmen\u2019s compensation cases for reviewing courts is as follows: Bethenergy Mines v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Skirpan), 531 Pa. 287, 291, 612 A.2d 434, (1992).\n[The proper scope of review] is not whether, upon reweighing all of the evidence, the decision reached by a referee appears to have been the most reasonable and probable one that could have been rendered. Rather, judicial review is limited to a determination of whether the record contains substantial evidence that supports the referee\u2019s findings.\nGuidelines for an employer seeking to modify a claimant\u2019s benefits based on the claimant\u2019s ability to return to work are:\n1. The employer who seeks to modify a claimant\u2019s benefits on the basis that he has recovered some or all of his ability must first produce medical evidence of a change in condition.\n2. The employer must then produce evidence of a referral (or referrals) to a then open job (or jobs), which fits in the occupational category for which claimant has been given medical clearance, e.g., light work, sedentary work, etc.\n3. The claimant must then demonstrate that he has in good faith followed through on the job referral(s).\n4. If the referral fails to result in a job then [the] claimant\u2019s benefits should continue.\nKachinski v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Vepco Construction Co.), 516 Pa. 240, 252, 532 A.2d 374, 380 (1987).\nIn this case, the employer presented testimony of a medical doctor and a vocational counselor. The counselor was employed by by the workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier to locate work for Perfile. The doctor testified that Per-tile\u2019s injury had been surgically addressed, that his condition had improved, and that he was able to return to light duty work. The vocational counselor testified that she conducted a vocational interview with Perfile, that she identified jobs which would be suitable for him and informed him of twenty-one positions at which he was expected to apply. Perfile testified that he applied for all of the positions given to him by the vocational counselor. The employer, however, contends that Perfile did not apply for a job at one employer, TriState Equipment.\nThe vocational counselor stated that she notified Perfile of the Tri-State position on October 20, 1988. Perfile testified that he applied in person for that job on October 25, 1988 and left his resume. The vocational counselor testified that she contacted TriState twice: once after the initial referral on October 28, 1988 and later as a follow up. On both occasions, Tri-State informed the vocational counselor that they did not have an employment application for Perfile, although at the second inquiry, they also indicated that they had discarded applications for the job in question. The second inquiry was made in preparation for the hearing.\nThe referee concluded that the only job available to Perfile for which he did not apply was the job at Tri-State Equipment. Further, the referee found that Perfile was not credible in claiming that he applied for the position. Qn the other hand, he found that the vocational counselor was more credible \u201cbased on the information she received from the employer that claimant did not apply for the position.\u201d Referee\u2019s Decision, Finding 16, p. 6.\nThe referee found that the counselor began her second series of checks with all the employers between November 1989 and January 1990. The referee stated: \u201cHer testimony establishes that by that time applications had been thrown out and employers were unwilling or unable to provide information.\u201d Referee\u2019s Decision, Finding 14, p. 5. As to the second contact with Tri-State and other employers, the vocational counselor testified:\nQ. So that between the first follow-up contact and then your second follow-up contact, isn\u2019t it true that he could have applied and then they threw, away or discarded his application in the mean time?\nA. Yes, that\u2019s certainly true.\nDeposition of Nanette M. Beerens, January 22, 1990 at 64.\nPertile\u2019s view is essentially that Commonwealth Court was correct in its reversal of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Review Board because the referee\u2019s decision was based on inadmissible hearsay evidence. We agree.\nPertile\u2019s objection that the employer\u2019s evidence was hearsay was made at the hearing and properly preserved. The referee overruled the objection and employer\u2019s counsel stated:\n[I]t is physically not possible to bring in a representative from every employer every time there is a modification petition filed as it relates to a claimant such as Mr. Pertile, or in this particular case, twenty or twenty-one different employers.\nThat would necessitate service of twenty or twenty-one subpoenas on the individual with whom Ms. Beerens [the vocational counselor] or the co-vocational consultant has had contact.\nI think that Ms. Beerens is testifying as a vocational expert, and as such she is permitted the leeway to testify as it relates to information that she has developed about certain jobs and that information that has been conveyed to her by the employer.\nN.T. 134a-135a. The referee concluded:\nClaimant\u2019s hearsay objections to the testimony of Nanette Beerens, based on her reliance on information obtained from prospective employers of the claimant, is overruled. The hearsay statements of the prospective employers to Beerens are of the type reasonably relied upon by an expert in the vocational rehabilitation field in forming an opinion on the subject of whether a claimant has followed through in the appropriate manner on job referrals. [The type of fact to which the counselor testified] falls within the parameters of permissible hearsay data allowed by the Commonwealth Court in [Acme Markets, Inc. v. WCAB (Pilvalis), 142 Pa.Cmwlth. 400, 409 n. 3, 597 A.2d 294, 298 n. 3 (1991) ].\nReferee\u2019s Decision, Conclusions of Law, No. 4, p. 8.\nIn McCray v. W.C.A.B., 167 Pa.Cmwlth. 402, 409-10, 648 A.2d 348, 351-52 (1994), Commonwealth Court explained Acme:\nIn Acme we explained in a footnote that the testimony of employer\u2019s expert vocational witness with regard to the specific job duties connected with the work and the position was admissible where the witness gained her information from personal observation and where the information was of \u201cthe type reasonably relied on by an expert in the particular field in forming an opinion on the subject.\u201d Acme, 142 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. at 409 n. 3, 597 A.2d 294.... In the case at bar, the controversial evidence did not involve Ms. Mihok\u2019s personal observations. Moreover, it did not contain information which is the type relied upon by a vocational expert to form an opinion. ... The objected to evidence here consisted of statements made to Ms. Mihok, by the prospective employers, regarding whether or not Claimant applied for a job and Claimant\u2019s conduct during job interviews. There is no expert opinion involved with such testimony.\nHere, as in McCray, there is no expert opinion involved with the testimony as to whether Pertile\u2019s job application was on file. Such an inquiry is purely a matter of fact and is plainly subject to the hearsay objection. The testimony was erroneously admitted.\nIn fact, it is difficult to imagine a case more illustrative of the evils of hearsay testimony. Without the employer being present, Perfile was helpless to inquire as to whether there may not have been an error in the employer\u2019s report that he did not apply. Perfile could not inquire as to who searches the files for applications, their qualifications, who creates the files, the security and reliability of the files, the cost to the employer of responding to the vocational counselor\u2019s inquiries, or the importance to the employer or lack of importance in making sure that its responses are accurate. It is conceivable that the files at Tri-State were created and maintained by poorly trained temporary personnel who had no interest or ability to insure their accuracy. Perfile was entitled to mount a meaningful challenge to the accuracy of information concerning his application, and such a challenge was impossible in the absence of the employer.\nIt was error to admit the hearsay testimony of the vocational counselor. Commonwealth Court was correct holding that there was no substantial evidence in support of the decisions of the lower tribunals.\n.Order of Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\n\u00d1EWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nCASTILLE, J., files a concurring opinion.\n. There was no substantial evidence because the evidence upon which the referee\u2019s decision was based was inadmissible. This rationale is different from that of Commonwealth Court. Commonwealth Court held that Pertile had met his burden of showing that he applied for the job in question, and that the employer had not rebutted Pertile\u2019s testimony, since Pertile may have applied but his application may have been lost. Presumably, Commonwealth Court believed that Pertile did not apply on October 25, since the employer had no record of his application on October 28, but that he may have applied after October 28 and his application may have been lost.\nPertile prevails in the case not because he may have applied after October 28 and his application may have been lost, as Commonwealth Court reasoned, but because he introduced evidence of his October 25\" application and the employer introduced only inadmissible hearsay evidence that rebuts his testimony that he applied on October 25. The employer\u2019s evidence as to possibly lost applications has no bearing on the case, for such evidence was also inadmissible hearsay and, in any event, was immaterial since Pertile made no claim that he applied after October 28, the date when the counselor checked the first time."}
