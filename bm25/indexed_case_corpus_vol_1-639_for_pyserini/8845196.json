{"id": "8845196", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chibe Justice M\u00c1'xby,\nPlaintiff, William IT. Hess, while driving to work on October 3, 1944 stopped at 29th Street and Girard Avenue, Philadelphia for a traffic light. While the car was' halted, defendant\u2019s overhead loose trolley wire, carrying a current of 600 volts, came in contact with plaintiff\u2019s car. As a result, pl\u00e1intiff, according to his testimony, \u201cwas lifted up out of the seat of the car\u201d and \u201chit the steering wheel\u201d-. \u201cI just sensed something was wrong, the car felt hot. ... I seen a lot of blue around, blinding blue, and I couldn\u2019t see parts of the car for about a second while I.was held up in the air. Then I could hardly breathe. When I sat down I realized there was something wrong with the car, it was hot, and I took my coat part like this somehow (hold the tail of the coat in hand), and I undone the door, and I stepped out, and when I stepped out I froze like a statue ... it felt like something went up my back and hit me -in the top of the head; that\u2019s all I can tell you.\u201d The electric shock thus received caused plaintiff to suffer contusions, abrasions, psychoneurosis and impotence. For these injuries plaintiff sought to recover damages in a suit against defendant-in which the latter was charged with negligence in its control and management of the trolley wire. A verdict for $5,000. was recovered by plaintiff and final judgment was entered thereon. Defendant filed motions for judgment n. o. v. and a new trial. Both motions were denied and this appeal followed.\nImmediately after the occurence described and while still in a dazed condition, Hess entered a restaurant and phoned\u2019 the police. He afterwards drove to the Bendix plant where he was employed as a machinist. He became ill shortly after his arrival and went to the plant dispensary. While there he fainted. After regaining consciousness and assuring the attending personnel that he felt physically capable, he drove home and went to b\u00e9d. He remained at home under the care of his family physician, Dr. Bernstein, for three days)\nUpon returning, to work, Hess discovered that his mental and physical condition preven ted. him from satisfactorily discharging his regular duties. He thereupon transferred to the shipping room at a reduction in wages. Because he \u201ccouldn\u2019t stand the noises in the shop from the time that it [the accident] happened\u201d, he resigned and sought employment elsewhere. Plaintiff testified: \u201cI just wanted always to run out through a window or through a door when any noises was around me. 7 couldn\u2019t stand the noise and I can\u2019t stand it to this day.\u2019 The neurosis which plaintiff developed as a result of the accident, forced him to undertake intermittent and irregular employment at a gradual but marked impairment in earnings. Plaintiff complained of constant \u201cheadaches\u201d and stated that he couldn\u2019t reach over and pick things up off the floor without getting a headache. He experienced \u201cblind spots\u201d and gave up his work because eventually the noises \u201cgot on his nerves\u201d.\nDr. Bernstein, plaintiff\u2019s family physician, testified that he found no physical evidence of injury; that plaintiff had no organic injuries but apparently was suffering from a mental neurosis which made him believe many things were wrong with him. Dr. Bernstein referred Hess to a specialist for further diagnosis. Dr. Drayton, a neuropsychiatrist, examined plaintiff on December 10, 1945 and likewise discovered no signs of physical injury. He diagnosed plaintiff\u2019s condition as \u201cintense psychoneurosis\u201d. Dr. Drayton conceded the genuineness of Hess\u2019 mental state and attributed it to a \u201cterrible fright\u201d emerging probably from the realization that \u201che was lucky to be alive\u201d. The reaction, in his opinion, was \u201creal and genuine\u201d. He was uncertain as to whether or not plaintiff would recover from his condition but suggested psychoanalysis or narcophypnosis as a possible treatment.\nThe reality of plaintiff\u2019s injuries was disputed by the expert testimony of defense witnesses, C. T. Pierce, electrical engineer for Westing-house Electric Corp., and C. D. Fawcett, Professor of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania and a consulting engineer. They, in attempting to controvert plaintiff\u2019s claims, stated it was scientifcally impossible for an accident such as that described by plaintiff to occur, and that a person inside an automobile is insulated against shock from lightning or any other electrical manifestation since the electrical current in such instances will encircle the car through its outside metal and will pass into the ground. The person in the car will suffer no injury. A photograph of an actual\u2019experiment conducted by the Westinghouse laboratories was- produced at the trial to prove the invulnerability of a car\u2019s occupant to an electrical shock. The experiment consisted of pouring three million volts into an. automobile from a distance of 10 or 12 feet, with electricity passing through the outside metal of the car and off a wheel rim to the ground, leaving unharmed a man sitting at the wheel of the car. The engineers estimated that three or four hundred thousand volts had passed through the car and stated that there was no \u201cdifference of potential\u201d from which a shock could' result, and that the situation was the sam\u00e9 as to plaintiff and his car where far less voltage was involved.\nWhether or not plaintiff suffer\u00e9d the shock alleged was a matter for the jury\u2019s consideration. Since the scientific impossibility of an occurrence such as that described by the plaintiff was not incontrovertibly established by defendant\u2019s expert testimony and since the circumstances and atmospheric conditions attending the experiment conducted were not identical to those attending plaintiff\u2019s experience, the court was precluded from passing on this question as a matter of law. The jury by its verdict decided that plaintiff suffered a physical impact, that is an electric shock, which would justify damages for the mental distress or fright resulting therefrom.\nThat there can be no recovery for injuries resulting from fright, or a nervous shock, unaccompanied by physical injuries is the established law in this state. See Koplin v. Louis K. Liggett Co., 322 Pa. 333, 185 A. 744; Howarth v. Adams Express Co., 269 Pa. 280, 112 A. 536; Ewing v. Pittsburgh, Cincinnati & St. Louis Ry. Co., 147 Pa. 40, 23 A. 340; Huston v. Freemansburg Boro, 212 Pa. 548, 61 A. 1022. In the latter ease Chief Justice Mitchell characterized \u201cmere mental disturbance\u201d as being too \u201cintangible, so untrustworthy, so illusory and so speculative\u201d to be a cause of action. However, in applying the above rule, a \u201cnervous shock\u201d must be distinguished from an \u201celectric shock\u201d. \u2018An electric shock is \u201ca direct physical and personal assault\u201d, and any fright or nervous disorders arising from such an \u201cassault\u201d negligently caused is compensable in damages. See Buckbee v. Third Ave. R. R. Co., 64 App. Div. 360,72 N. Y. S. 217. In North German Lloyd Steamship Co. v. Wood, 18 Pa. Superior Ct. 488, the Superior Court said: \u201cThe nervous system is a part of the physical organization, and this affidavit sufficiently alleges a physical injury. Mental suffering, as distinct from bodily pain, can be considered in an.action for damages for injury to the person, when such suffering is attendant upon and results from a physical injury: Wilcox v. Richmond & Danville Ry. Co., 52 Federal Reporter, 264.\u201d .\nThe. Supreme Court of New Jersey in Consolidated Traction Co. v. Lambertson, 59 N. J. L. 297, 36 A. 100, held that where there is actual physical injury, damages resulting from the incidental fright may be recovered.\nIn .view, of the fact that at the time of the injuries complained of the defendant\u2019s wire was on the rear bumper of plaintiff\u2019s car and that during part of the period plaintiff had one foot on the ground and the Other in the car, and in view of the further fact that on the morning of the occurrence it had been raining and therefore presumably the'ground was damp, the jury was justified in concluding that plaintiff\u2019s claim that he' had received an electric shock was true. We \u00e1gree with what the court below said in denying a motion- for a new trial, to wit: \u201cthe evidence in this case was sufficient for the jury to find enough of- a physical injury to permit recovery also for the injury to-plaintiff\u2019s nervous system resulting from the fright. Assuming, as we must, that plaintiff received an electrical shock originating from the current flowing through defendant\u2019s trolley wire (it was not questioned that the jury\u2019s verdict established defendant\u2019s negligence in the falling of the wire), the experiencing of such a shock must be considered a substantial physical injury rather than a mere technical battery, even though no externally visible marks were found. . . . But here, taking into consideration the heavy voltage in a trolley wire (600 volts), and plaintiff\u2019s description of his reactions at the time of the shock, it must be considered a stibstantial physical injury, sufficient to carry with it the consequences of the fright that also brought psychic injury to him.\u201d\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
