The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n(1) Given the extensive impact the Superior Court\u2019s published opinion could have on the lower courts and prosecution offices in situations where a defendant initiates a statutory summary appeal from a Magisterial District Judge\u2019s sua sponte finding of guilt on an uncharged, lesser-included offense, should this Honorable Court grant review because the purpose for double jeopardy protections are not implicated, or implicated minimally, when the defendant appeals his conviction for a trial de novo?\n(2) Should this Honorable Court exercise its supervisory authority over the Superior Court\u2019s erroneous discharge of defendant and remand his case for sentencing on the lesser-included offense he appeals and necessarily was found guilty of committing?"}
