{"id": "1761052", "contents": "OPINION\nROBERTS, Justice.\nOn April 8, 1975, appellant Ronald Upshur was convicted by a jury of murder of the first degree, robbery, and conspiracy. The court sentenced him to consecutive prison terms of life and twenty-five to fifty years. On direct appeal, appellant seeks relief on the ground, inter alia, that the trial court improperly refused trial counsel\u2019s request for an \u201caccomplice\u201d charge, and that trial counsel\u2019s subsequent failure to challenge this ruling in written post-verdict motions constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree, vacate the judgments of sentence, and grant a new trial.\nI\nOn April 15, 1975 trial counsel filed timely post-verdict motions averring in boiler plate fashion that the verdicts were unsupported by the evidence and contrary to law. At post-verdict argument, however, trial counsel briefed and argued numerous other issues. The court en banc held that the issues raised by written post-verdict motions lacked merit, and that the other issues had been waived because they were not filed in written post-verdict motions pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123. See Commonwealth v. Carrillo, 483 Pa. 215, 395 A.2d 570 (1978) (post-verdict court properly exercises discretion by refusing to address issues not presented in written post-verdict motions).\nAppellant, through new counsel, now contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to include these other issues in post-verdict motions, and that this Court should therefore consider these other issues. We must resolve the ineffectiveness claim by determining whether \u201cthe particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 604, 235 A.2d 349, 352 (1967); see generally Commonwealth v. Dancer, 460 Pa. 95, 331 A.2d 435 (1975).\nHere trial counsel, after filing boiler plate motions, briefed and argued before the post-verdict court issues not contained in the written post-verdict motions. It must be assumed that, in counsel\u2019s view, judicial consideration of these issues would advance his client\u2019s interests. In such circumstances, there can be no reasonable basis for the failure to raise issues in accordance with Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123. The interests of his client are in no way advanced by raising issues in an impermissible manner. Cf. Commonwealth v. Von Smith, 486 Pa. 564, 406 A.2d 1034 (1979) (untimely motion for severance cannot be predicated on any reasonable trial strategy). Since appellant\u2019s trial counsel failed to include in post-verdict motions the issues he thereafter wished to be considered by the court, appellant was denied effective representation. Accordingly, we consider the issues ineffective trial counsel failed to preserve properly.\nII\nOf the issues now properly before this Court, we need address only one. Malcolm McLaughlin testified for the Commonwealth that he heard appellant on two occasions admit to robbing and killing Alvin Smultkis. On the basis of other evidence adduced at trial, appellant\u2019s trial counsel contended that McLaughlin was an \u201caccomplice,\u201d and requested the court to instruct the jury on the weight to be accorded \u201caccomplice\u201d testimony. The court refused this charge. Appellant here urges that the court\u2019s refusal constitutes reversible error. We agree.\nTestimony of a witness who is an accomplice in the crime charged and testifies for the prosecution \u201cis to be carefully scrutinized and accepted with caution.\u201d Commonwealth v. Sisak, 436 Pa. 262, 265, 259 A.2d 428, 430 (1969); see Commonwealth v. Mouzon, 456 Pa. 230, 318 A.2d 703 (1974); Commonwealth v. Coades, 454 Pa. 448, 311 A.2d 896 (1973); see generally 3A Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 967 (Chadbourn rev.); Pennsylvania Standard Jury Instructions \u2014 Criminal \u00a7\u00a7 4.01-.03 (May 15, 1972 Draft). The rationale of this view is that \u201c[s]uch a witness, out of a reasonable expectation of leniency, has an interest in inculpating others.\u201d Commonwealth v. Russell, 477 Pa. 147, 153, 383 A.2d 866, 868 (1978); see generally Cool v. United States, 409 U.S. 100, 103, 93 S.Ct. 354, 357, 34 L.Ed.2d 335 (1972); Commonwealth v. Turner, 367 Pa. 403, 409-410, 80 A.2d 708, 712 (1951). An accomplice charge is necessitated not only when the evidence requires an inference that the witness was an accomplice, but also when it permits that inference. Commonwealth v. Sisak, supra, 436 Pa. at 268, 259 A.2d at 431.\nWhether evidence in this case permits an inference that McLaughlin was an accomplice is controlled by our decision in Commonwealth v. Thomas, 479 Pa. 34, 387 A.2d 820 (1978). Thomas arose from the same criminal incident as this case, and presented, as here, the issue whether Curtis Thomas, appellant Upshur\u2019s codefendant, was entitled to an accomplice charge. The evidence at Thomas\u2019s trial indicated that Thomas and two Commonwealth witnesses, McLaughlin and Smith, were members of Black Brothers Incorporated. This organization operated for the purpose of conducting criminal activity, and owned a gun available to its members for use in obtaining illegal \u201cprofits\u201d to be shared by all. Nonetheless, the trial court, as here, refused a requested accomplice instruction. This Court reversed. We held such \u201cevidence . . . permits the inference that the witnesses McLaughlin and Smith were participants in a conspiracy to commit robberies and other illegal acts in order to financially support ...\u201d Black Brothers Incorporated, id., 479 Pa. at 38, 387 A.2d at 822, and thus concluded that Thomas was entitled to an accomplice charge.\nThe Commonwealth fails to persuade us that on this issue the facts in Thomas are distinguishable from those in the instant case. The evidence adduced at appellant Upshur\u2019s trial demonstrates that McLaughlin and appellant were members of Black Brothers Incorporated, and that shortly after the robbery and killing of Smultkis appellant in disguise entered a meeting of Black Brothers Incorporated at which McLaughlin was present and announced his crime. Later that day appellant entrusted to McLaughlin the weapon he used in this criminal incident \u2014 a weapon owned by Black Brothers Incorporated.\nAs in Thomas, the facts here permit an inference that McLaughlin, as a member of Black Brothers Incorporated, participated in a conspiracy with appellant to rob and kill Alvin Smultkis. Here, as in Thomas, we hold that the trial court erroneously refused trial counsel\u2019s request for an accomplice charge.\nJudgments of sentence vacated and new trial granted.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nNIX, J., joins this opinion and files a concurring opinion. O\u2019BRIEN, J., concurs in the result.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion, in which FLAH-ERTY, J., joins.\n. Appellant took this direct appeal from his conviction for felonious homicide under the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II \u00a7 202(1), formerly 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1), replaced by 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722. The Superior Court transferred appellant\u2019s appeal of the conspiracy and robbery convictions to this Court under the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. V \u00a7 503, formerly 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.503, replaced by 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 705.\n. Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123 (effective July 23, 1973) provides in relevant part:\n\u201c[0]nly those issues raised and the grounds relied upon in the [post-verdict] motions may be argued.\u201d\n. Appellant also appeals the post-verdict court\u2019s finding that the verdict is supported by the evidence. This claim is meritless.\n. In addition to this evidence, trial counsel by cross-examination of McLaughlin sought to establish the nature of Black Brothers Incorporated\u2019s activities, as was done in Thomas. Upon Commonwealth objections, however, the trial court refused to permit this line of questioning."}
