{"id": "1099575", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nThe court below refused to enter judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and plaintiff has appealed. On such an appeal, unless we reverse and enter, or direct the entry of, final judgment for plaintiff, it is not customary to discuss the merits of the case, or the particular points of attack, \u2014 many of which may not arise on trial. Here, it is sufficient to say that, on the pleadings before the court below, it did not err in discharging plaintiff\u2019s rule for judgment. We may add, however, that we are not impressed by the points of practice, urged by appellant, that neither the original nor the amended affidavit of defense was endorsed with the notice to plaintiff of defendant\u2019s claim of set-off, as required by section 15 of the Practice Act of May 14, 1915, P. L. 483, 485-6, or that this omission alone is enough to warrant judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor. While no such notice as provided for in the act was endorsed on the affidavits of defense, yet plaintiff not only took cognizance of the first affidavit without raising any point as to the lack of the statutory endorsement, but, after receipt of that pleading, amended its statement of claim and ruled defendant for a more specific affidavit. Moreover, defendant sent to counsel for plaintiff, in the envelope with the amended affidavit of defense, a separate written notice, substantially in the words of the statute, as follows: \u201cYou are hereby required to file a reply to the claim for set-off of the defendant as hereby amended within fifteen days from the service hereof,\u201d and counsel for plaintiff accepted service thus: \u201cService is hereby accepted......of the claim for set-off of the defendant in the above-entitled case heretofore filed, and of the amendment thereto.\u201d Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the court below erred in declining to hold the absence of the endorsement fatal to defendant, or, on the rule before it, in refusing to enter judgment for plaintiff.\nThe order appealed from is affirmed."}
