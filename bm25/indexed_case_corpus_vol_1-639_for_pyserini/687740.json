Does the EHB have the authority to determine that a Clean Streams Law award of attorneys\u2019 fees is not appropriate where the applicants\u2019 appeals were dismissed as moot without a decision on the merits and where the EHB determines, as finder of fact, that the applicants were not prevailing parties, did not achieve some degree of success on the merits, and did not make a significant contribution to a full and final determination of the issues?\nb. Does the fee-shifting language of Section 307 of the Clean Streams Law, 35 P.S. \u00a7 691.307 (relating to industrial waste discharges) apply where the proceeding does not arise from DEP action on a permit for industrial waste discharge and the applicants for fees were not adversely affected by the DEP action?"}
