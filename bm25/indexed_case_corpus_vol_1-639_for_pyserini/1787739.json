{"id": "1787739", "contents": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nOn December 21, 1978, Karen Nye was killed in an automobile accident. At the time of her death, the decedent was covered by a No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance policy issued by appellant Erie Insurance Exchange (Erie). Appellee, C. William Nye, Jr., the decedent\u2019s father and administrator of her estate, submitted a claim to Erie for payment of work loss benefits under the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act. His claim was denied by Erie.\nOn November 15, 1979, appellee instituted the present class action against Erie and thirty other insurance companies which allegedly followed a practice of refusing to pay work loss benefits to the estates of deceased victims.\nAll of the defendant insurance companies filed preliminary objections contending, inter alia, that the complaint failed to state a cause of action against them. All defendant insurance companies, except Erie, also contended that Nye lacked standing to sue them.\nOn February 4, 1981, the trial court found that appellee Nye lacked standing to sue all defendant insurance companies, except Erie, and dismissed the complaint against those defendants. On April 30, 1981, the trial court additionally found that appellee\u2019s complaint failed to allege a cause of action against Erie, and granted him leave to amend his complaint. Appellee chose not to amend and on June 4, 1981, suffered dismissal of his action. The trial court did not have an opportunity to determine whether Nye\u2019s action should be certified as a class action pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1710, since the complaint was dismissed before appellee had an opportunity to file a motion for certification pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1707. Appellee appealed from the February 4th and June 4th orders of the trial court, and, on December 10, 1982, the Superior Court reversed both orders. Nye v. Erie Insurance Exchange, 307 Pa.Super. 464, 453 A.2d 677 (1982). The Superior Court held that Nye may institute a class action against all defendant insurance companies, and that appellee\u2019s complaint stated a cause of action. This Court granted allocatur on March 18, 1983.\nThe first issue raised in this matter is whether appellee has standing to institute a class action against all of the named defendant insurance companies.\nA party seeking judicial resolution of a controversy in this Commonwealth must, as a prerequisite, establish that he has standing to maintain the action. William Penn Parking Garage, Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh, 464 Pa. 168, 346 A.2d 269 (1975). \u201cThe core concept, of course, is that a person who is not adversely affected in any way by the matter he seeks to challenge is not \u2018aggrieved\u2019 thereby and has no standing to obtain a judicial resolution of his challenge.\u201d William Penn Parking Garage v. City of Pittsburgh, supra.\nThe requirement that a party must be \u201caggrieved\u201d as a prerequisite to maintaining an action in this Commonwealth is applicable to class actions. In McMonagle v. Allstate Insurance Co., 460 Pa. 159, 331 A.2d 467 (1975), this Court held that a plaintiff in a class action who has not suffered an injury from the challenged conduct of a defendant cannot maintain a class action against that defendant.\nIn the present case, Nye\u2019s complaint fails to allege that he has been aggrieved by the conduct of any of the defendant insurance companies except Erie. Consequently, appellee lacks standing to maintain an action against these defendants.\nThe second issue raised in this matter is whether appellee\u2019s complaint, which seeks wage loss benefits on behalf of an estate, states a cause of action against Erie. Based upon and for the reasons set forth in our opinion and decision in Freeze v. Donegal Mutual Insurance Company, 504 Pa. 218, 470 A.2d 958 (1983), we find that Nye\u2019s complaint does state a'cause of action against Erie.\nWe, therefore, reverse the Superior Court\u2019s order that appellee may institute a class action against all defendant insurance companies, and affirm the Superior Court\u2019s order that appellee\u2019s complaint states a cause of action against Erie.\nNIX, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nFLAHERTY, J., files a concurring opinion.\nROBERTS, C.J., and HUTCHINSON, J., filed a concurring and dissenting opinion.\n.
