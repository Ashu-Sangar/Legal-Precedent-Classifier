{"id": "1926163", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Bobeets,\nAppellant Irvin C. Herge is now sixty-five years old. Some twenty-three years ago, he entered a plea of guilty to a charge of murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment. No direct appeal was taken. Since that time, however, he has not ceased his efforts to secure some form of post-conviction relief.\nOn February 6, 1967, appellant filed the present petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act. He alleged (1) that he was entitled to a Jackson-Denno hearing on whether his confessions, admitted into evidence at his degree of guilt hearing, were voluntary, and (2) that he was unconstitutionally denied his right to appeal. The hearing judge held that he was not entitled to a Jackson-Denno hearing, and, after an evidentiary hearing, that he was not denied his right to appeal. We reverse both determinations.\nIn Jackson v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S. Ct. 1774 (1964), the Supreme Court held unconstitutional New York\u2019s procedure of submitting, for jury determination at trial, disputed questions of fact concerning the voluntariness of a confession. The Court stated that a proper determination of voluntariness could not be made when the jury is, at the same time, considering questions of guilt, since the jury \u201cmay find it difficult to understand the policy forbidding reliance upon a coerced, but true confession.\u201d 378 U.S. at 382, 84 S. Ct. at 1783. Not only did the Court hold New York\u2019s procedure unconstitutional, it further mandated the procedure that must be used to satisfy due process. \u201cThe procedures used in the trial court to arrive at its conclusions on the coercion issue . . . must ... be fully adequate to insure a reliable and clear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession, including the resolution of disputed facts upon which the voluntariness issue may depend.\u201d 378 U.S. at 391, 84 S. Ct. at 1788.\nThe instant case differs from Jackson in one important respect\u2014the resolution of the factual dispute over voluntariness was here made by a judge, rather than a jury. Nevertheless, Jackson\u2019s insistence on a \u201cclear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession\u201d must be satisfied. We must find that the trier of fact has \u201cfac[ed] the issue squarely.\u201d 378 U.S. at 390, 84 S. Ct. at 1788. This is fundamentally important because an appellate court must be certain that the trier of fact did resolve disputed facts, and did apply the proper law to these facts. Otherwise, we could not insure a defendant\u2019s right to have an involuntary confession entirely disregarded. See Jackson, 378 U.S. at 389, 390, 84 S. Ct. at 1787, 1788.\nIn the instant case, however, we have no clear-cut resolution of the factual disputes over voluntariness. Compare United States ex rel. Owens v. Cavell, 254 F. Supp. 154 (M.D. Pa. 1966). The trial judge made no finding on whether the confessions were voluntary, although it is implicit in his opinion that he believed the confessions were truthful. Nowhere does he assure us that he considered these issues separately, a requirement mandated by Jackson See also Rogers v. Richmond 365 U.S. 534, 544, 81 S. Ct. 735, 741 (1961) (Frankfurter, J.) (attention of trial judge must focus on whether confession was \u201cfreely self-determined,\u201d without regard to whether defendant spoke the truth). Thus we are in the same position that the Supreme Court of the United States was in Jackson. \u201cWe cannot determine how the . . . [judge] resolved these issues and will not assume that they were reliably and properly resolved against the accused.\u201d 378 U.S. at 387, 84 S. Ct. at 1786.\nTo make a determination of voluntariness, conflicting testimony must be weighed, and credibility must be assessed. Thus we may not now, as did the hearing court, search the record made at the 1946 degree of guilt hearing to decide the factual question of whether the confessions were voluntary, even if we do apply present-day law. See Commonwealth v. Baity, 428 Pa. 306, 237 A. 2d 172 (1968). For example, the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses testified to a somewhat leisurely interrogation and stated that the confessions were completely voluntary; appellant testified that he was questioned for two days, got little sleep, was placed in a very uncomfortable cell, and did not remember what he said or did during those two days (he made numerous contradictory confessions). Further, as the trial judge noted in his opinion, appellant is a borderline case between sanity and insanity, and the Commonwealth\u2019s experts all agreed that appellant lacks the ability to stand pressure, is wholly impulsive, and is given to self-pity. Under these circumstances, we cannot now possibly determine\u2014from a cold record without any finding as to voluntariness\u2014whether appellant\u2019s \u201cwill ha[d] been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u201d Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 602, 81 S. Ct. 1860, 1879 (1961) (Frankfurter, J.). Without a negative determination of this issue, \u201cthe use of his confession offends due process.\u201d Id.\nThere remains one further consideration. The Commonwealth urges, and the hearing court so found, that appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not bring to the trial court\u2019s attention their desire to object to these confessions on the ground of involuntariness. Clearly, appellant would not now be entitled to relief if counsel had made a choice to not attack the voluntariness of the confessions. See, e.g., Commonwealth ex rel. Smart v. Myers, 424 Pa. 315, 317, 227 A. 2d 831, 832 (1967).\nBut that is not the case here. True, appellant\u2019s counsel did not object to every statement, oral and written, which was introduced. He did, however, object specifically to the introduction of several written statements, and his cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses evidences counsel\u2019s desire to test the voluntariness of all the confessions. In fact, when he specifically noted, near the beginning of the trial, his objections to the confessions on the ground of involuntariness, the trial court held that the statements were admissions, not confessions, and hence admissible. We do not exalt form over substance, and we do not require counsel to make constant and repetitive objections where, as here, the tainted evidence constituted the bulk of the hearing. We do require that the issues be called to the trial court\u2019s attention. That requirement has been met here. See Commonwealth ex rel. Fox v. Maroney, 417 Pa. 308, 313 n.5, 207 A. 2d 810, 813 n.5 (1965) (citing facts of several cases where we have held no waiver).\nAppellant not having waived his right to object to the introduction of these statements, we therefore now hold that he is entitled to a Jaelcson-Denno hearing on their voluntariness.\nWe next consider appellant\u2019s claim to relief under Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S. Ct. 814 (1963). It is now settled law in this Commonwealth, that, when confronted by a trial record which is silent on the question of the waiver of the right to appeal, the burden rests on the Commonwealth to prove such a waiver. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Wilson, 430 Pa. 1, 241 A.2d 760 (1968). In the instant case we cannot say that the Commonwealth has met its burden.\nAppellant, under questioning by both the district attorney and his own counsel, stated that in 1946 he did not know of his right to appeal, was indigent, and did not know of his right to have counsel appointed. The original trial judge testified that he did not inform appellant of his right to appeal. Further, appellant testified that his original lawyers, hired by his brother, abandoned him after sentence was imposed. The Commonwealth produced no evidence, but the hearing judge held that appellant had voluntarily and knowingly waived his right to appeal, apparently because of statements made by appellant under questioning by the hearing judge.\nThe most that can be said about the statements \u201ccontradicting\u201d appellant\u2019s testimony on knowledge of his right to appeal is that the statements were given in response to some rather confusing questions. As to the problem of his indigency, no one contends that, in 1946, he was told of his right to free appellate counsel. The Commonwealth does contend, however, that appellant was not indigent and, therefore, did not forego an appeal because he could not pay for counsel. But there is absolutely no proof that he could afford appellate counsel. At best, the Commonwealth has shown that appellant had a very small amount of money. The Commonwealth has not shown that this money was sufficient to have retained appellate counsel, nor may we speculate that it was. \u201cIndigency,\u201d in the context of Douglas and Wilson, supra, does not mean total lack of funds; it means lack of sufficient funds. Thus, on either the ground of lack of knowledge of the right to appeal, or on the ground of lack of knowledge of the right to free appellate counsel, appellant must be given relief, since the Commonwealth has not carried its burden of proof.\nAppellant now being entitled to an appeal as though timely filed, we reverse and remand this record to the court below with directions that the court shall appoint counsel for the purpose of filing and arguing post-trial motions and, if necessary, prosecuting an appeal. Since we have also found that appellant\u2019s right under Jackson v. Denno, supra, has been violated, we remand for a hearing on that issue as well.\nThe order of the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Lawrence County is reversed and the record is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nMr. Justice Eagen concurs in the result.\nMr. Justice Jones and Mr. Justice Pomeroy dissent.\nAppellant made several other claims which were denied by the hearing court, but these claims were not pressed on this appeal.\nIf anything, the judge\u2019s opinion indicates that he did not consider the question of voluntariness independently. The judge merely ruled that the damaging statements were \u201cadmissions,\u201d not \u201cfull confessions.\u201d Such a distinction today is not viable. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 476, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 1629 (1966); cf. Commonwealth ex rel. Corbin v. Myers, 423 Pa. 243, 223 A. 2d 738 (1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 1013, 87 S. Ct. 1361 (1967). Further, when defense counsel objected to the introduction of a statement, on the basis that he wished to interrogate witnesses as to how the statement was obtained, the judge ruled that this objection applied only to confessions, not admissions. At only one time did the trial judge make any reference to voluntariness when ruling on admissibility. But this ruling was a bare statement that the confession was voluntary, and it hardly fulfills the Jaclcson requirement. The trial court did not give any reasons for finding the statement voluntary, either in the record or in its opinion, and this finding was made before appellant\u2019s testimony, or the testimony of any of the psychiatrists was even heard. Thus the record as a whole would appear to indicate that the hearing court never did consider squarely the question of voluntariness, as opposed to truthfulness.\nBoth of appellant\u2019s original trial lawyers are now deceased. But in a letter sent to appellant a year after his degree of guilt hearing, the then district attorney wrote: \u201c[A]nother matter which I have no direct connection with, is the fact that your brother and Mr. Logan [one of appellant\u2019s original trial counsel] had some personal misunderstanding in connection with the possibility of a new trial. ... I can assure you, had Mr. Logan taken the necessary steps, which he is well familiar with, you might have been granted a new trial.\u201d\nThe colloquy was as follows: \u201cThe Court: You had money to hire your own counsel at that time [1946] ? Mr. Herge: I had $485.00. . . . The Court: And you knew you had the right to take an appeal, but you didn\u2019t have a transcript, that was what was making you mad at the time [1946] isn\u2019t that right? Mr. Herge: Yes. The Court: When you were convicted in 1946, you knew of your right to take an appeal, but you couldn\u2019t do it without the transcript? Mr. Herge: I couldn\u2019t do it without a transcript. As to know which court to go to, I didn\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know until ten years later the difference between a Supreme and a Superior Court. The Court: But you knew at the [?] time you had a right to go up? Mr. Herge: Yes.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth also urges that appellant has waived his right to Douglas relief because of Section 4 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act. This contention is without merit. All but one of appellant\u2019s collateral attack proceedings were commenced before Douglas was decided. Thus, they could not operate to waive his claim. See Commonwealth ex rel. Berkery v. Myers, 429 Pa. 378, 239 A. 2d 805 (1968) ; Commonwealth v. Stevens, 429 Pa. 593, 240 A. 2d 536 (1968). The only collateral attack pursued after Douglas was done without counsel. Again, we have \u201cmade it quite clear that waiver may be presumed only where the petitioner had counsel at the time the waiver allegedly occurred.\u201d Commonwealth v. Mumford, 430 Pa. 451, 455, 243 A. 2d 440, 442 (1968). The Commonwealth could, of course, prove intentional waiver in the post-Douglas proceeding, but this it has not done. Further, although the Commonwealth does not suggest that appellant waived his right to Jaclcson-Denno relief, we might note that the reasons for finding no waiver of his Douglas claim apply with equal force to his Jackson-Denno claim, Jackson v. Denno not having been decided until 1964."}
