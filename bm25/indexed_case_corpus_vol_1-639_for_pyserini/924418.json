{"id": "924418", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis was an action of trespass to recover damages for personal injuries caused to and received by the plaintiff by reason of the defective, dangerous and unsafe condition of a certain public road in the township of Amity. On the trial of the case a verdict for the plaintiff of $3,000 was rendered by the jury. The court below refused to grant a new trial and an appeal was taken to this court. The only specification of error on the appeal was \u2019\u2022*' that under all the evidence the verdict must be for the defendant.\u201d The testimony in the case, however, was such as compelled a reference of it to the jury, and a withdrawal of it from their consideration would have been palpable error. This appears in the charge of the court and its refusal to grant a new trial. The case was fairly presented to the jury and there was no error in their verdict or in the refusal of the court to order another trial.\nJudgment affirmed."}
