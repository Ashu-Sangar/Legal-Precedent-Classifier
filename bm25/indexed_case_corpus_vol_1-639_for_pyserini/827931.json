{"id": "827931", "contents": "Pee Curiam :\nThe appellant has assigned a single extract from the charge of the court below, as error. An examination of the charge as a whole shows that the learned judge fairly submitted to the jury the question of the payment of the mortgage. If paid, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover. The jury having found, under proper instructions, that the mortgage had not been, paid, the verdict for plaintiff naturally followed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
