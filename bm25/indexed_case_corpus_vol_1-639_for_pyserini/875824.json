{"id": "875824", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis case was argued with Bordley et al.\u2019s Appeal from same decree. For reasons briefly given in an opinion just filed, in that case, at No. 137, July term, 1895 (ante, p. 464), we think there is nothing in the record that would justify us in disturbing the decree; nor does it appear to us that either of the specifications of error requires further notice.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellants."}
