{"id": "1742164", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, Mary Belle Firth, was convicted by a jury of murder of the third degree. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to four to eight years\u2019 imprisonment. This direct appeal followed.\nAppellant claims that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction for murder of the third degree. We do not agree.\nThe facts are as follows. In late August, 1974, appellant discovered that she was pregnant. The alleged father, Bobby Nave, also the victim in this case, had told appellant he was a widower living with his sister. Appellant discovered, however, that he was married and living with his wife.\nOn September 7, 1974, appellant decided to confront Nave and his wife. Since she did not have a car, she went to Frank\u2019s Cafe in York, Pennsylvania to find a ride to Nave\u2019s house in New Freedom, Pennsylvania. While in the tavern, appellant drank four double shots of ginger brandy and two beers. She then was offered a ride to Lamotie\u2019s Cafe, which was next door to Nave\u2019s house. There she drank another beer and then bought a six pack of beer to take to the Nave\u2019s residence.\nFor the next two hours, appellant and the Naves drank the beer and some wine and argued. Appellant finally asked to be driven home. The trio left for appellant\u2019s home, stopping for a six pack of beer along the way. After arriving at appellant\u2019s house, the three went inside and continued their drinking.\nAt some time during the evening, appellant secured a rifle and was sitting with the gun on her lap. The victim\u2019s wife went upstairs to use the bathroom and upon returning downstairs saw her husband lying on a bed, writhing in pain. Mrs. Nave asked her husband what happened, and the victim replied, \u201cShe [appellant] shot me.\u201d Mr. Nave died shortly thereafter. When police arrived, appellant told police that she shot the victim because she loved him.\nIn Commonwealth v. Rose, 463 Pa. 264, 267-68, 344 A.2d 824, 825-826 (1975), we stated:\n\u201cThe test of sufficiency of the evidence is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and drawing the proper inferences favorable to the Commonwealth, the trier of fact could reasonably have found that all of the elements of the crime had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, it is the province of the trier of fact to pass upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence produced. . . . The fact-finder is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence.\nReviewing the evidence with this standard in mind, it is clear that the evidence is sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction.\nAppellant claims that absent her statement, the evidence is insufficient. When determining sufficiency of the evidence, we must review \u201call of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence introduced at trial . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Commonwealth v. Chenet, 473 Pa. 181, 183, 373 A.2d 1107, 1108 (1977). Appellant\u2019s claim is thus without merit.\nAppellant next claims that the court erred in refusing to suppress her statement. She claims she was too intoxicated to understand her constitutional rights. The facts are as follows.\nThe police were called immediately after the shooting. Upon arrival, Detective Dean Leppo informed appellant of her constitutional rights. After so advising her, Detective Leppo asked appellant if she understood her rights. She replied, \u201cYes, I understand, but I only shot him because I loved him.\u201d It is this statement that appellant believes should have been suppressed. We do not agree.\nIn Commonwealth v. Goodwin, 460 Pa. 516, 522-23, 333 A.2d 892, 895 (1975), we stated:\n\u201cThe burden to prove a valid waiver by a preponderance of the evidence is upon the Commonwealth . . . and our responsibility upon review is to determine whether the record supports the factual findings of the court below and the legitimacy of the inferences and legal conclusions drawn from those findings. ... In making this determination, we are to consider only the evidence of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and so much of the evidence for the defense as, fairly read in the context of the record as a whole, remains uncontradicted.\u201d (Citations omitted.)\nWe further stated in Commonwealth v. Jones, 457 Pa. 423, 432-33, 322 A.2d 119, 125 (1974), \u201cIntoxication is a factor to be considered, but it is not sufficient, in and of itself to render a confession involuntary.\u201d \u201cThe test is whether there was sufficient mental capacity for the defendant to know what he was saying and to have voluntarily intended to say it.\u201d Commonwealth v. Culberson, 467 Pa. 424-28, 358 A.2d 416, 417 (1976).\nAt the suppression hearing, various police officers testified that while appellant had been drinking, she was not so intoxicated as to not understand what was going on. Even three defense witnesses testified that appellant was responsive to police questioning. The officers further testified that appellant was warned of her constitutional rights, which she waived. Under these circumstances, the court did not err in refusing to suppress her statement.\nAppellant next claims the court erred in refusing her motion for a mistrial. The facts are as follows.\nAt trial, Officer Ronald McClain testified that appellant told him that she loaded the gun immediately before firing. Other officers had testified, and the transcript of the questioning revealed, that appellant had said she didn\u2019t know the gun was loaded. The prosecutor immediately asked Officer McClain to check his notes because of the discrepancy. Appellant moved for a mistrial. The trial court refused the motion, but twice instructed the jury to disregard that portion of McClain\u2019s testimony which was erroneous. McClain himself admitted that this portion of the testimony was incorrect.\nThe granting of a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the trial court. In Commonwealth v. Goosby, 450 Pa. 609, 611, 301 A.2d 673, 674 (1973), this court quoted from Commonwealth v. Phillips, 183 Pa.Super. 377, 382, 132 A.2d 733, 736 (1957), and stated:\n\u201c \u2018. . . A new trial is required when the remark is prejudicial; that is, when it is of such a nature or substance or delivered in such a manner that it may reasonably be said to have deprived the defendant of a fair and impartial trial.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added by this Court in Goosby, supra.)\nIn light of the court\u2019s curative instruction and the witness\u2019 admission of error, we believe appellant suffered no prejudice and was not entitled to a mistrial.\nAppellant finally complains that the trial court erred in refusing her requested points for charge on intoxication. However, when discussing appellant\u2019s exceptions to the charge, the following occurred:\n\u201cTHE COURT:\n\u201cWith regard to point # 1, denied. With regard to Point # 2 having to do with the matter of intoxication as a complete defense, that is denied. With regard to a third charge with regard to intoxication, I believe I have covered that in my charge sufficiently.\n\u201cMR. VAUGHN [Defense counsel]:\n\u201cI agree with that.\u201d\nAppellant thus has waived any claim that the court erred in its intoxication charge as relates to voluntary manslaughter.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\n. The question of voluntariness was raised at trial and submitted to the jury."}
