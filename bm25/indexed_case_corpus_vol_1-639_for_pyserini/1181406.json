{"id": "1181406", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe are all agreed that the action of the court below in entering judgment n. o. v. was correct. Appellant\u2019s evidence failed to establish a commission contract with appellee. A review of the record shows that all the testimony of appellant is utterly inconsistent with the existence of the alleged contract. As the parties alone are interested in the facts, it is unnecessary to detail the evidence and their contentions.\nJudgment affirmed."}
