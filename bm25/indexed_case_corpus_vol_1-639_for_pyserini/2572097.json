{"id": "2572097", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nMr. Justice Eakin announces the Judgment of the Court. Mr. Justice Eakin delivers the Opinion of the Court with respect to parts II, III, and IV.B, in which Mr. Justice Castille, Madame Justice Newman and Mr. Justice Saylor join, and a plurality opinion with respect to parts I and IV.A, in which Mr. Justice Castille and Madame Justice Newman join.\nThis appeal presents two issues: (1) whether an interlocutory appeal as of right, pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 311(d), lies from a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for recusal; and (2) whether the Commonwealth has a right under the Pennsylvania Constitution to have a jury determine the degree of guilt after a defendant pleads guilty to murder generally. The Superior Court concluded it did not have jurisdiction under Pa.R.A.P. 311(d) to review the recusal motion, and that the Commonwealth has a right to a jury at a degree of guilt hearing. Commonwealth v. White, 818 A.2d 555 (Pa.Super.2003). We reverse in part and affirm in part.\nThe Philadelphia police arrested 11-year-old Mariam White in conjunction with the stabbing death of Rose Marie Knight. By operation of law, White was charged as an adult for the crime of murder. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6355(e). There were several failed attempts at negotiating a plea before the Honorable Renee Cardwell Hughes of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. Subsequently, White\u2019s counsel moved to decertify the case to juvenile court. The decertification proceedings occurred before the Honorable Legr\u00f3me D. Davis. Before the decertification motion was decided, several more attempts at negotiating a plea were made, but no agreement was reached. Ultimately, Judge Davis denied decertification, and the case returned to Judge Hughes. See N.T. Decertification Hearing, 11/2/00, at 38.\nDefense counsel told Judge Hughes that White intended to plead guilty to murder generally and requested that the court schedule a degree of guilt hearing. N.T. Status Hearing, 11/8/00, at 4. The prosecutor inquired whether the judge believed a degree of guilt hearing could result in a verdict of less than third degree murder, i.e., voluntary manslaughter. Id., at 8-9. Judge Hughes responded in the affirmative. Id. at 9. One week later, the prosecutor appeared before Judge Hughes and asked that she recuse herself. N.T. Status Hearing, 11/17/00, at 2. The prosecutor asserted that while plea negotiations were ongoing prior to the decertification proceedings, Judge Hughes made statements which showed judicial bias. Id., at 4. Judge Hughes denied the request for recusal. The prosecutor also requested that the Commonwealth be afforded its right to a jury trial. Id., at 10. Judge Hughes denied the request. Finally, the prosecutor asked that the court certify both questions for immediate appeal under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702(b). Id., at 11-12. Again, the judge denied the request. The Commonwealth appealed the judge\u2019s rulings.\nOn appeal, the Superior Court quashed in part and reversed in part. White, at 563. The court first addressed the availability of an immediate appeal from an order denying a recusal motion under Pa.R.A.P. 311(d), which allows the Commonwealth to appeal, as of right, an interlocutory order that \u201cterminates or substantially handicaps\u201d the prosecution. White, at 558. The court reasoned it need not \u201caccept blindly\u201d the Commonwealth\u2019s certification of substantial handicap. Id. Rather, \u201cwhen issues other than those evidentiary in nature are raised, we may pause to consider the propriety of the Commonwealth\u2019s certification.\u201d Id., at 559. The court considered the fact that the ruling did not interfere with the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to present its case, and ultimately declined to expand Rule 311(d) to include an appeal from an order denying recusal. White, at 559. The court also considered whether the jury trial issue was appealable under Rule 311(d), and concluded that precluding the Commonwealth from appellate review of this issue would allow a trial court to overrule a constitutional provision based on its own interpretation, which \u201cno doubt\u201d constituted a substantial handicap under Rule 311(d). White, at 560-61.\nIn considering whether the Commonwealth has a right to a jury at a degree of guilt hearing, the Superior Court first noted the procedural rule governing such hearings \u201caffords a criminal defendant the option of having the trial judge, rather than a jury, determine her degree of guilt.\u201d Id., at 561. The court then noted that \u201cimplementation of the Rule is irrelevant in the event that the Commonwealth seeks to exercise its constitutional right to a jury trial.\u201d Id. The Commonwealth\u2019s right to a jury trial is \u201cthe same as\u201d the defendant\u2019s, as provided for by Article 1, \u00a7 6 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. \u201cIts effect, simply, is to permit the Commonwealth to insist on a jury trial despite a criminal defendant\u2019s decision to waive that same right.\u201d White, at 561. The Superior Court concluded a guilty plea to murder generally is unique, and what follows is akin to a trial, since the proceedings still involve the presentation of evidence, the arguments of counsel, and the findings of fact in support of the verdict. Id., at 562. Accordingly, the court concluded a degree of guilt hearing was \u201ca variation of a waiver trial and as such, it cannot trump the Commonwealth\u2019s constitutional right to demand a jury trial.\u201d Id.\nThis Court granted allowance of appeal on the question of \u201cwhether the Commonwealth is permitted to appeal an order denying recusal of a trial judge as an interlocutory order pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 311(d), and if so, whether denial of the recusal motion was in error.\u201d Commonwealth v. White, 577 Pa. 316, 845 A.2d 199, 200 (2004). We also granted allowance of appeal to address whether the Commonwealth has a right to a jury at a degree of guilt hearing when a defendant pleads guilty to murder generally.\nI. Commonwealth\u2019s Right to Appeal Denial of Recusal Under Pa.R.A.P. 311(d)\nWe turn first to the question of the Commonwealth\u2019s right to appeal under Rule 311(d) when a trial court denies a recusal motion. It is well settled that, as a general rule, appellate courts have jurisdiction only over final orders. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 742 (providing appellate jurisdiction to Superior Court over \u201cfinal orders\u201d); id., \u00a7 762 (same for Commonwealth Court); Commonwealth v. Wells, 553 Pa. 424, 719 A.2d 729 (1998). That general rule, however, is subject to exceptions which give appellate courts jurisdiction to review interlocutory orders under limited circumstances. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702 (governing appellate jurisdiction over interlocutory orders); see also Pa.R.A.P. 311 (interlocutory appeals as of right); Pa.R.A.P. 312 (interlocutory appeals by permission). Rule 311(d) provides such an exception in criminal cases when an order terminates or substantially handicaps the prosecutor\u2019s case:\nIn a criminal case, under the circumstances provided by law, the Commonwealth may take an appeal as of right from an order that does not end the entire case where the Commonwealth certifies in the notice of appeal that the order will terminate or substantially handicap the prosecution.\nPa.R.A.P. 311(d).\nThe Commonwealth asserts the text of Rule 311(d) does not bar review of recusal rulings. Further, a plain reading of the text, coupled with this Court\u2019s prior case law, leads to the conclusion that the Commonwealth must be allowed to appeal from pre-trial rulings that implicate \u201cthe particular burden which it bears to prove its case.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 33 (quoting Commonwealth v. Cosnek, 575 Pa. 411, 836 A.2d 871, 877 (2003)). According to the Commonwealth, an order denying recusal implicates this precise burden, because a biased court can hamper the presentation of the prosecutor\u2019s case.\nWhite responds that the Commonwealth\u2019s contentions are at odds with Cosnek, which she argues specifically limited the scope of Rule 311(d) to appeals from \u201cpretrial ruling[s] resulting] in the suppression, preclusion or exclusion of Commonwealth evidence.\u201d White\u2019s Brief, at 15 (quoting Cosnek, at 877).\nAs both parties argue Cosnek controls the outcome of this issue, we begin our analysis with that case. In Cosnek, we considered whether the Commonwealth had the right to appeal an order which ruled on the admissibility of defense evidence. Cosnek, at 871. We first considered the \u201clegal underpinnings\u201d of Rule 311(d), noting the government may bring an interlocutory appeal in criminal cases only under express statutory authority. Cosnek, at 873. We then examined the origin of Rule 311(d), explaining the language of the Rule was derived from Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, 411 Pa. 56, 190 A.2d 304 (1963), in which this Court devised a strategy for evaluating cases after Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961). Cosnek, at 874. In Mapp, the United States Supreme Court concluded that evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment was inadmissible in state proceedings. Cosnek, at 874. Thus, Bosurgi held that when a pre-trial order of suppression will terminate or handicap the prosecution, the order has such an \u201cattribute of finality\u201d as to give the Commonwealth the right of immediate appeal. Cosnek, at 874. In Cosnek, we further explained that subsequent case law clarified Bosurgi, such that the Commonwealth merely needed to allege an order suppressing, precluding, or excluding evidence terminated or substantially handicapped its case to be entitled to a pre-trial appeal under Rule 311(d). Cosnek, at 874 (citing Commonwealth v. Dugger, 506 Pa. 537, 486 A.2d 382, 386 (1985)).\nFollowing this review of Rule 311(d), we concluded the Commonwealth did not have a right to an interlocutory appeal from an order admitting defense evidence under Rule 311(d). We noted the origin of the Rule was to ensure the Commonwealth could meet the specific burdens of proof of the case and the focus of the Rule was the suppression, preclusion, or exclusion of Commonwealth evidence. Cosnek, at 877. For these reasons, we held the application of Rule 311(d) was limited to a pre-trial ruling that results in the \u201csuppression, preclusion or exclusion of Commonwealth evidence.... \u201d Cosnek, at 877.\nThe instant case, however, does not involve an order \u201csuppressing, precluding, or excluding\u201d Commonwealth evidence; thus, the parties dispute the relevance of Cosnek. White argues Cosnek expressly limited the application of Rule 311(d) to the Commonwealth\u2019s right to appeal an interlocutory order in the suppression of evidence context. The Commonwealth encourages a much broader reading of Cosnek, which would include all cases where the Commonwealth alleges the order \u201cterminates\u201d or \u201csubstantially handicaps\u201d its case.\nRule 341 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure defines a \u201cfinal order\u201d as an order disposing of all claims and all parties, any order expressly defined as a final order by statute, or any order entered pursuant to subsection (c) of the Rule. Pa.R.A.P. 341(b). The Comment to Rule 341 explains that, following the 1992 amendments to the Rule, in the criminal context \u201c[o]rders formerly appealable under Rule 341 by the Commonwealth in criminal cases as heretofore provided by law, but which do not dispose of the entire case, are now appealable as interlocutory appeals as of right under Subdivision (d) of Rule 311.\u201d Comment, Pa.R.A.P. 341. Thus, criminal orders which had been appealable under Rule 341 were to be encompassed within Rule 311(d).\nCosnek sought to apply Rule 311(d) to the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal of an in limine ruling which denied its motion to exclude defense evidence; it did not involve an order remotely similar to that at issue here. The limited question in Cosnek was the proper application of Rule 311(d) in light of the specific challenge forwarded; we were not asked to revisit and rewrite Rule 311(d), nor to deal with circumstances not there presented. Rules and cases serve differing functions and have differing effects. Rules certainly build upon and reflect experience, but they primarily seek to frame future expectations and attempt to provide general guidance. Cases, on the other hand, are narrow and necessarily fact-bound. Thus, Cosnek\u2019s language that \u201cwe limit the application of Rule 311(d) to those \u2018circumstances provided by law\u2019 in which a pretrial ruling results in the suppression, preclusion or exclusion of Commonwealth evidence,\u201d Cosnek, at 877, should not be read as undoing Rule 311(d), which simply provides the Commonwealth may appeal an order, not just certain types of orders, which terminates or substantially handicaps the prosecution. See Cosnek, at 882 (Eakin, J., dissenting); accord Commonwealth v. Shearer, 584 Pa. 134, 882 A.2d 462, 471-72 (2005) (Newman, J., concurring); id., at 472-74 (Saylor, J., concurring); id., at 474-75 (Eakin, J., concurring and dissenting). This is the plain language of the Rule, and to the extent Cosnek may be understood differently, it is hereby overruled. Accordingly, when an order terminates or has the practical effect of terminating some or all of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, or substantially handicaps the Commonwealth\u2019s case, and the Commonwealth has certified the same in good faith, the Commonwealth is entitled to an interlocutory appeal as of right under Rule 311(d).\nHere, the Commonwealth has certified in good faith that denial of its recusal motion will substantially handicap its prosecution of this case. See Notice of Appeal, 11/21/00. Indeed, if the judge is unable to preside and serve as fact-finder impartially, and an unfair verdict is rendered, the Commonwealth, unlike a criminal defendant in a similar circumstance, has no appellate recourse. Thus, \u201cif there is a good faith certificate that a pretrial ruling substantially hampers the case of the party whose one job is to seek justice, and the only possible time to appeal is before jeopardy attaches at trial, the appeal should be allowed.\u201d Cosnek, at 884 (Eakin, J., dissenting). Accordingly, we proceed to review the merits of the recusal issue under Rule 311(d).\nII. Merits of Recusal Issue\nThe Commonwealth sought recusal of Judge Hughes based on her interaction with White, expressions of her personal feelings about the accused and the case, and opinions about the justice system\u2019s ability to handle the case. The judge believed White, a juvenile, was not suited for adult prison, and that the parties agreed that the matter should proceed with a nontraditional disposition, i.e., with White being evaluated by a mental health professional in order to determine a more appropriate facility in which to house her. However, when the parties were convened before the court at a status hearing, it came to the judge\u2019s attention that the Commonwealth drafted a letter to the mental health evaluator, which the judge believed resulted in White not being evaluated as originally discussed. See N.T. Status Hearing, 12/2/99, at 3-10. The judge stated:\nTo say I am angry is just \u2014 doesn\u2019t even begin to equate to you the level of hostility that I feel right now; because number one, I thought it was clear to everyone in this room that I do not think the traditional judicial system is prepared to accommodate the case that is in front of us.... Our best effort, our best avenue of making something happen has been foreclosed and I am convinced is because of this letter.... [S]o I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m going to get her out of adult prison to get an assessment. I am angry.\nId., at 5-6.\nBecause White had been told she would meet the judge that day, she was brought before the court, even though there was to be no formal evaluation at that time. The judge engaged her in conversation, during which she told White she was \u201cabsolutely beautiful,\u201d had a \u201cgorgeous smile,\u201d and that she wanted \u201cto send [her] to someplace where [she] could grow up to be a beautiful young woman.\u201d Id., at 23. The judge inquired if White was eating, asked her about her favorite foods, admitted to liking some of the same foods and commented that her son also liked those foods, and said she would try to \u201csee if they can get you a pizza every now and then.\u201d Id., at 24-26. Before White left the courtroom, the judge told her she was \u201cglad to meet [her]\u201d and that she was \u201cgoing to work very hard on getting [her] into a good place,\u201d but White had to \u201cbe good.\u201d Id., at 27. The judge then shook White\u2019s hand and said, \u201cOh, wonderful. I am so pleased to meet you.\u201d Id., at 28. When White responded affirmatively that she would \u201cwork with\u201d the judge, the judge responded, \u201cExcellent. Good girl.\u201d Id.\nWhen it became evident there would be no expert evaluation of White at the status hearing as originally planned, thus leaving the trial court with nothing upon which to assess White and proceed with a non-trial disposition of the case, the judge stated:\nI have got to have something. Even if I subpoena the records and hold them in camera for me, and I am permitted to do that, but I have got to have \u2014 I need something now because ... if we can\u2019t get past this hurdle and this is a significant hurdle in my mind, if we can\u2019t get past this hurdle, what you are leaving me with is to treat this case like any other case in the system. And I don\u2019t care who knows this from Justice Flaherty all the way down. This system is not equipped to deal with this case, and I don\u2019t want to treat it this way. And unless I am ordered to by higher-ups, I am not going to, and I am still not going to disadvantage either one of you. And so I may have to do some things that are unusual. I don\u2019t want to be boxed into treating this like a regular case. It\u2019s not appropriate. It\u2019s not appropriate. And at this point in time nobody can force me to do this unless y\u2019all come in here with an order from Flaherty. You can\u2019t force me to treat this like a regular case. So I want the medfical records] in camera.\nId., at 41-42.\nAt a subsequent status hearing held after a different trial judge refused to decertify White\u2019s case from criminal to juvenile court, the Commonwealth orally requested that Judge Hughes recuse herself because \u201cthere [was] the appearance of prejudgment by [the judge] in [the] matter.\u201d N.T. Status Hearing, 11/17/00, at 2. The judge responded:\nI don\u2019t think that there is any basis for your request for recusal. Let\u2019s be absolutely clear. I do not think that a seven year old should be tried as an adult, and that is what this child has the intellectual capacity of. She is biologically 13 years old. I make no bones about that. I have been very clear publicly and in private. I think this law is wrong. However, I think any fair examination of my record reveals that I absolutely uphold the law in all instances. Mariam White was tried as an adult. That decision has been made by a court over which I have no review authority. I have been advised by the defense that she seeks a degree of guilt, period. The protocol in this jurisdiction is that section leaders retain the degree of guilt, period. It stays in my room.... I will not recuse myself. There is no legal basis for recusal.\nId., at 2-3. The judge further emphasized that she had not prejudged the case, and there was nothing on the record that said she would do anything other than follow the law. Id., at 4. After refusing to certify the issue for appeal under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702(b) and accepting the Commonwealth\u2019s written recusal motion for review, the judge commented, \u201cI know what was presented to me and what has not been presented to me, and the arrogance of you to come in here and presume that I would somehow not honor my obligations as a jurist is patently offensive.\u201d N.T. Status Hearing, 11/17/00, at 15-16. When the Commonwealth tried to make one more request, the judge replied, \u201cI don\u2019t want any more requests from you because you have prejudged me and it is inappropriate. It is absolutely inappropriate and it is baseless.\u201d Id., at 17.\nThe standard for recusal is well-settled:\nIt is the burden of the party requesting recusal to produce evidence establishing bias, prejudice or unfairness which raises a substantial doubt as to the jurist\u2019s ability to preside impartially. As a general rule, a motion for recusal is initially directed to and decided by the jurist whose impartiality is being challenged. In considering a recusal request, the jurist must first make a conscientious determination of his or her ability to assess the case in an impartial manner .... The jurist must then consider whether his or her continued involvement in the case creates an appearance of impropriety and/or would tend to undermine public confidence in the judiciary. This is a personal and unreviewable decision that only the jurist can make. Where a jurist rules that he or she can hear and dispose of a case fairly and without prejudice, that decision will not be overturned on appeal but for an abuse of discretion.\nCommonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, 553 Pa. 485, 720 A.2d 79, 89 (1998) (citations omitted). Furthermore, \u201c[a]ny tribunal permitted to try cases and controversies must not only be unbiased but must avoid even the appearance of bias.\u201d In the Interest of McFall, 533 Pa. 24, 617 A.2d 707, 713 (1992). \u201cThere is no need to find actual prejudice, but rather, the appearance of prejudice is sufficient to warrant the grant of new proceedings.\u201d Id., at 714.\nThe dissenting opinion filed in the Superior Court in this matter is well-reasoned and persuasive. In analyzing the exchange between the judge and White, the dissent noted:\n[T]his type of dialogue is rarely seen between a court and a defendant. It is unquestionable that the subject matter is peculiar in the courtroom setting, although it appears that the trial court was attempting to gauge [White\u2019s] mental stability and chose a level of conversation appropriate for a twelve-year-old in order to do so.... However, in doing so the trial court managed to share personal information about itself and its family. Worse yet, the trial court told [White] that it would attempt to get her pizza while she was incarcerated, which would certainly constitute special treatment as I doubt that the trial court often attempted to obtain pizza for other alleged murderers who await trial. Whether or not the trial court\u2019s conduct during the 12/02/99 status hearing amounts to an appearance of impropriety is a very close question.\nWhite, at 565 (Joyce, J., dissenting). The dissent went on to examine the judge\u2019s statements that she could not be \u201cforced to treat this like a normal case\u201d; the dissent pointed out that, contrary to the judge\u2019s statements, \u201cthe law does provide for this type of situation.\u201d Id. Citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6322, 6355(e), Judge Joyce noted:\nContrary to the trial court\u2019s belief that \u201cthis system is not equipped to deal with this case\u201d the legislature has already made a determination as to how this type of case is to be handled. The trial court\u2019s pronouncement that it was not going to be \u201cboxed into treating this like a normal case\u201d unless it was \u201cordered to by higher-ups\u201d indicates that the trial court pre-judged the case and [was] unwilling to follow the law as set forth by the legislature, and as it was required to do.\nId., at 567.\nWe agree; although the judge stated that she would be able to apply the law, her oft-voiced opinion was about the shortcomings of the legal system in this type of case and her refusal to treat the case \u201cnormally,\u201d short of \u201can order from [then Chief Justice] Flaherty.\u201d Such public denouncement of the very system in which an impartial jurist is one of the key components creates the appearance of impropriety. Telling the accused that she was going to work hard to do things for her was inappropriate for an impartial jurist. Had the judge offered to work hard for the prosecution, White would certainly have grounds for recusal \u2014 showing partiality is not excused merely because the parties are reversed.\nPersonal opinions concerning the adequacy or propriety of the law pertaining to a given situation have no place on the trial bench. While the underlying facts concerning White\u2019s background are indeed tragic, the law provides the procedure to be followed in White\u2019s case. As the judge who presided at the decertification hearing noted: \u201cI cannot exonerate Mariam just because I feel sorry for her. I cannot return Mariam to juvenile court just because her life story and her life circumstances make my heart weep. I can\u2019t do it. My oath as a judge requires that I decide this case on the basis of the facts that I heard in court, and that\u2019s what I have done.\u201d N.T. Decertification Hearing, 11/2/00, at 38. Judge Hughes\u2019s comments created an appearance of impropriety which added to the already questionable conversation she engaged in with White.\nFinally, the judge\u2019s reaction to the Commonwealth\u2019s recusal request cements the conclusion that recusal is appropriate in this case because of the appearance of impropriety. As the dissent noted:\nThe vehement reaction of the trial court to a motion that is reasonably meritorious is the proverbial final nail in the coffin.... While the examples I have reviewed, standing alone, may not warrant the conclusion that there existed an appearance of impropriety, I would find that in the aggregate, such a determination is compelling. While I can appreciate the efforts of the trial court in attempting to reach a resolution favorable to all the parties involved, in doing so the overall effect was to create an appearance of impropriety.\nWhite, at 568 (Joyce, J., dissenting).\nMindful of the high standard to which a trial judge is held, and of the ready availability of another trial jurist, we conclude the judge should have recused herself in this matter.\nIII. Commonwealth\u2019s Right to Appeal Denial of Request for Jury at Degree of Guilt Hearing Under Pa.R.A.P. 311(d)\nThe second question is whether the Commonwealth is entitled to demand a jury at a degree of guilt hearing when a defendant pleads guilty to murder generally. Before addressing the merits of this issue, we must determine whether we have jurisdiction over the issue, since it also comes before this Court under Rule 311(d).\nThe Superior Court concluded it had jurisdiction over this question under Rule 311(d), relying on Commonwealth v. Johnson, 542 Pa. 568, 669 A.2d 315 (1995). See id. (assuming jurisdiction over interlocutory order transferring case from criminal to juvenile division). The court was persuaded that if jurisdiction were not present, this constitutional issue might never reach the appellate courts; in the event of an acquittal, the Commonwealth would have no right to appeal because it is precluded from challenging a not guilty verdict. White, at 561 n. 6. Similarly, in the event of a conviction, the Commonwealth would have no right of appeal since it was not an aggrieved party. Id.\nThe Commonwealth certified that the denial of its request for a jury at the degree of guilt hearing would substantially handicap its case; this issue is intertwined with the recusal issue, as the Commonwealth is asserting it will be forced to proceed before a judicial fact-finder who is biased against it. There are two potential protections either party in a criminal proceeding may have in a circumstance where there is concern the presiding judge will be unfair or biased: a recusal request or a jury demand. Here, the Commonwealth was denied both, and, as the trial court inexplicably refused to certify the question for interlocutory appeal under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702(b), sought review under the only avenue available to it: Rule 311(d). Having complied with the requirements of that Rule by certifying in good faith that denial of a jury will hamper the presentation of its case, the Commonwealth is entitled to review under Rule 311(d), and we proceed to the merits of the jury trial issue.\nIV. Commonwealth\u2019s Right to Jury at Degree of Guilt Hearing\nWhite argues Pa.R.Crim.P. 803(A) and 590(C) are clear: when a defendant pleads guilty to murder generally, only the trial judge has the authority to determine the degree of guilt. A guilty plea to murder generally is simply a guilty plea, she avers, and there is no right to a jury for a guilty plea; case law from this Court establishes a degree of guilt hearing is not a trial. White\u2019s Brief, at 50-51 (citing Commonwealth v. Petrillo, 340 Pa. 33, 16 A.2d 50 (1940); Commonwealth v. Staush, 256 Pa. 620, 101 A. 72 (1917)). Additionally, White asserts a defendant has no right to a jury at a degree of guilt hearing, and the Pennsylvania Constitution only gives the Commonwealth the same right to a jury as a defendant has. Consequently, the Commonwealth cannot have a right to a jury at a degree of guilt hearing.\nWhite also rejects the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556 (2002), and Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), for the proposition that a jury is required at a degree of guilt hearing. According to White, those cases merely demonstrate the Sixth Amendment bars a judge from imposing a sentence beyond the prescribed statutory maximum without having a jury determine the predicate facts for such a finding. Here, however, there is no sentencing issue, since there is nothing to suggest the judge might impose a sentence different from that provided by statute or engage in additional fact-finding during sentencing. Accordingly, White concludes that any reliance on those cases is inapt.\nThe Commonwealth responds that in Apprendi, Ring, and Blakely, the United States Supreme Court declared a defendant has a Sixth Amendment right to have a jury decide any factual questions that can trigger an increased maximum sentence. Therefore, those cases require a jury determination of an essential element of a crime, ie., mental state, which would be the issue at the degree of guilt hearing. Accordingly, a defendant has the right to have a jury make those determinations, and under Article I, \u00a7 6, the Commonwealth must have that same right.\nAlternatively, the Commonwealth points out that in order to plead guilty generally and proceed to a degree of guilt hearing, a defendant must waive the right to a jury trial. Thus, under Article I, \u00a7 6, if the defendant has the right, as she does if it must be waived, then the Commonwealth also has the right to a jury. The Commonwealth points out that Pa.R.Crim.P. 620 demonstrates both the defendant and the Commonwealth must waive a jury trial \u201cin all cases.\u201d Id. The Commonwealth argues that since it never waived such right, it was entitled to a jury at the degree of guilt hearing under Article I, \u00a7 6 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\nA. Analysis\nArticle I, \u00a7 6 was amended in 1998, to give the Commonwealth the same right to a jury trial as a defendant, and provides:\nTrial by jury shall be as heretofore, and the right thereof remain inviolate. The General Assembly may provide, however, by law, that a verdict may be rendered by not less than five-sixths of the jury in any civil case. Furthermore, in criminal cases the Commonwealth shall have the same right to trial by jury as does the accused.\nPa. Const. art. I, \u00a7 6. As the Commonwealth is expressly afforded \u201cthe same right\u201d that a defendant has, we must determine whether a defendant has the right to a jury at a degree of guilt hearing. If so, then the Commonwealth has the identical right.\nTraditionally, our jurisprudence has held a degree of guilt hearing is not a trial. Petrillo, at 56. However, as the Superior Court noted in the present case:\nA plea of guilty to murder generally is a unique plea, unlike anything else provided in statute or decisional law.... In a guilty plea, no evidence is presented against the defendant .... A Rule 590(c) proceeding, on the other hand still requires the presentation of evidence, the arguments of counsel and the finding of facts in support of a verdict.\nThis option, created by rule and available only to murder defendants, is not a simple guilty plea. It is instead a variation of a waiver trial....\nWhite, at 562. This characterization is generally correct; a defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to murder generally bifurcates the fact-finding process which ordinarily occurs at trial \u2014 it dispenses with the need to determine whether the defendant committed murder, but leaves open for determination the question of the degree. A plea of guilty to murder generally \u201cis simply an acknowledgement by a defendant that he participated in certain acts with a criminal intent.\u201d Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 528 Pa. 546, 599 A.2d 624, 626 (1991) (citing Commonwealth v. Anthony, 504 Pa. 551, 475 A.2d 1303 (1984)). The purpose of the degree of guilt hearing is \u201cto determine whether the homicide was murder of the first, second or third degree, or voluntary manslaughter.\u201d Commonwealth v. Myers, 481 Pa. 217, 392 A.2d 685, 687 (1978). Thus, although the defendant has pled guilty to murder generally, an essential question remains: the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the killing.\nRecently, the United States Supreme Court has expanded a criminal defendant\u2019s right to have a jury, rather than a judge, make factual determinations which subject a defendant to an increased penalty. In Apprendi, supra, the Court held any factual determination increasing the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury. Id., at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In Ring, supra, the Court held the determination of the existence of aggravating factors in a death penalty case must be made by a jury. Id., at 588, 122 S.Ct. 2428. Finally, in Blakely, supra, the Court held state sentencing guidelines were unconstitutional where they permitted a judge to sentence a defendant outside the guidelines, upon the judge\u2019s finding of additional facts such as deliberate cruelty. Id., at 303-04, 124 S.Ct. 2531.\nHere, as in Apprendi, Ring, and Blakely, factual determinations that affect the maximum penalty will be made at the degree of guilt hearing. A plea to murder generally raises a presumption of malice, an essential element of third degree murder; the defendant may rebut the presumption of malice by introducing evidence negating this element, thereby reducing the degree of guilt to voluntary manslaughter. See Commonwealth v. Shaver, 501 Pa. 167, 460 A.2d 742, 743 (1983); Commonwealth v. Geiger, 475 Pa. 249, 380 A.2d 338, 340 (1977); Commonwealth ex rel. Kerekes v. Maroney, 423 Pa. 337, 223 A.2d 699, 701 (1966) (noting that, to extent defendant may be found guilty of manslaughter after pleading guilty to murder generally, \u201cthe burden is upon him to adduce evidence which will so mitigate the offense\u201d). If the element of malice is disproven by White, she will be guilty of voluntary manslaughter, which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503(c); id., \u00a7 1103(1). If malice is not negated, White will be guilty of third degree murder, which carries a maximum penalty of 40 years imprisonment. Id., \u00a7 1102(d). Although the court does not have the authority to sentence White beyond the statutory maximum for either degree of homicide, White will still face the possibility of receiving twice the sentence for manslaughter if third degree murder is proven. As the Blakely Court noted, \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\u201d Blakely, at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531 (citing Ring, at 602, 122 S.Ct. 2428; emphasis in original). Therefore, the maximum sentence White may receive is dependent on the findings made at the hearing.\nB. Conclusion\nBy pleading guilty to murder generally, however, White waived her right to have a jury as fact-finder in her case. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 590(c); id., 803(A); Commonwealth v. White, 818 A.2d 555, 562 (Pa.Super.2003); see also Commonwealth v. Passmore, 857 A.2d 697, 710 (Pa.Super.2004). See generally Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175, 187, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004) (\u201cBy entering a guilty plea, a defendant waives constitutional rights that inhere in a criminal trial, including the right to a trial by jury[.]\u201d). Waiving one\u2019s right, however, does not constitute waiver of another\u2019s corresponding right; White cannot vitiate the Commonwealth\u2019s right by waving her own. Accordingly, we conclude the Commonwealth retains its right to a jury under Article I, \u00a7 6 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, Pa. Const. art. I, \u00a7 6 (\u201cin criminal cases the Commonwealth shall have the same right to trial by jury as does the accused.\u201d); see also Commonwealth v. Tharp, 562 Pa. 231, 754 A.2d 1251 (2000) (holding amendment to Article I, \u00a7 6, which affords Commonwealth same right to jury trial as accused, is constitutional), and it may request one at the degree of guilt hearing.\nY. Disposition\nAccordingly, we reverse the quashal of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal from the denial of its recusal motion and remand for the appointment of another judge in this matter. We affirm the order reversing the denial of the Commonwealth\u2019s request for a jury at White\u2019s degree of guilt hearing.\nOrder reversed in part and affirmed in part. Case remanded. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nJustice EAKIN delivers the Opinion of the Court with respect to parts II, III and IV.B, in which Justice CASTILLE, Justice NEWMAN and Justice SAYLOR join, and a plurality opinion with respect to parts I and IV.A, in which Justice CASTILLE and Justice NEWMAN join.\nFormer Justice NIGRO did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nChief Justice CAPPY files a dissenting opinion in which Justice BAER joins.\n. White\u2019s first name appears in the record as both \u201cMiriam\u201d and \"Mariam\u201d; however, a document bearing White\u2019s signature reflects the spelling as \"Mariam.\"\n. This section governs interlocutory appeals by permission and allows the court to certify an issue for appeal when it is \u201cof the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702(b).\n. The two issues presented for review are purely questions of law. Accordingly, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. Buffalo Twp. v. Jones, 571 Pa. 637, 813 A.2d 659 (2002).\n. \"In the wake of Mapp, new impetus has been given to the practice of filing by defendants of motions to suppress evidence seized in allegedly illegal searches. In this Commonwealth, such motions, save in exceptional circumstances, are now required to be made in advance of trial.\" Bosurgi, at 308 (emphasis in original).\n. Ordinarily, we would remand for the Superior Court to address the merits of this issue in the first instance, since quashal of an appeal does not involve ruling on the merits; however, in this instance, the Superior Court\u2019s majority opinion addressed the merits of the recusal issue in response to the dissent\u2019s consideration of the issue. The majority concluded the issue was meritless, whereas the dissent would have reversed, requiring that White\u2019s degree of guilt hearing be held before a different judge. Cf. White, at 559-60 and id., at 563-68 (Joyce, J., dissenting).\n. These Rules provide:\nWhen a defendant charged with murder enters a plea of guilty to a charge of murder generally, the judge before whom the plea is entered shall alone determine the degree of guilt.\nPa.R.Crim.P. 803(A).\nIn cases in which the imposition of a sentence of death is not authorized, when a defendant enters a plea of guilty or nolo contendere to a charge of murder generally, the judge before whom the plea was entered shall alone determine the degree of guilt.\nId., 590(C).\n. White also argues, for the first time, that the jury trial ballot question violated the \u201cseparate vote\u201d requirement of Article 11, \u00a7 1 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Pa. Const. art. XI, \u00a7 1. This issue is raised for the first time before this Court and as such, it is waived. Pa.R.A.P. 302(b).\n. The Rule provides, in pertinent part: \"In all cases, the defendant and the attorney for the Commonwealth may waive a jury trial with approval by a judge of the court in which the case is pending, and elect to have the judge try the case without a jury.\u201d\nPa.R.Crim.P. 620.\n. While these cases were decided under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the federal constitution, if a defendant has this right under the federal constitution, then the right also exists under the Pennsylvania Constitution. See Commonwealth v. Aponte, 579 Pa. 246, 855 A.2d 800, 806-07 (2004) (in interpreting provision of Pennsylvania Constitution, Court is not bound by United States Supreme Court decisions interpreting similar, yet distinct, federal constitutional provisions; however, federal constitution establishes certain minimum levels which are \"equally applicable to the [analogous] state constitutional provision.\u201d) (quoting Commonwealth v. Edmunds, 526 Pa. 374, 586 A.2d 887, 894 (1991) (citations omitted)). If a defendant has such right under the Pennsylvania Constitution, then so does the Commonwealth. Pa. Const. art. I, \u00a7 6.\n. First degree murder is not at issue, as the Commonwealth limited the charges to third degree murder and possession of an instrument of crime. See N.T. Status Hearing, 11/17/00, at 6."}
