{"id": "905088", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe paper in controversy was undoubtedly testamentary. It was to take effect after the death of the testator. It was in writing and was signed at the end thereof by the deceased. The opinion of the learned court below covers every contention of the appellant so fully, and so entirely to our satisfaction, that we affirm the decree for the reasons there stated.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant."}
