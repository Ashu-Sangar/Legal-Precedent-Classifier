{"id": "462723", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the decree of the court below discharging a rule to show cause why arbitration should not proceed in the manner provided in the agreement between the parties. The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, an instrumentality of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, created by the Act of May 21,1937, P. L. 774, entered into a contract dated June 22, 1939, with the plaintiff, Dickens, for the construction of a part of the Pennsylvania Turnpike situate in Somerset County. The work on this contract was completed on July 3,1940.\nThe basis of payment was the amount of ground removed pursuant to the contract. The parties could not agree as to this amount, and plaintiff invoked the arbitration clause of the contract. That clause provides, inter alia, as follows: \u201cArbitration. All questions or disputes respecting any matter pertaining to this contract, or any part thereof, or any breach of said contract, shall be prepared in writing by the contractor in detail, in triplicate, and submitted to the chief engineer of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. Reference of questions as herein provided shall not he made until after final quantities have heen determined and must he made. within thirty (SO) days thereafter and prior to payment therefor. The chief engineer will render a decision in writing on all items or questions in dispute. (Italics supplied.)\nThe Turnpike Commission contends that the dispute had not been submitted to the Chief Engineer within thirty days after final quantities had been determined, as required. Plaintiff contends that there never was a determination of \u201cfinal quantities\u201d and therefore the 30 day limitation period never began to run. His argument is that there is nothing in the contract which says who shall determine final quantities and that therefore they must be determined by mutual agreement. As to this contention the court below pertinently says: \u201cIf there were an agreement between the parties as to the quantities there would be no reason to arbitrate. If there were no agreement, the time when the matter could be submitted to the Chief Engineer under the petitioner\u2019s construction would never arrive, for the, contract says it must be made, within thirty days after final quantities have been determined.\u201d\nSection 49 of the \u201cGeneral Conditions\u201d of the contract provides, inter alia, as follows: \u201cTo prevent all disputes and litigation, the engineer shall in all cases determine the amount or quantity of the several kinds of work and the quality of materials which are to be paid for under this contract; he shall determine all questions in relation to the project and the construction thereof; and in all cases decide every question which may arise relative to the performance of the work covered by the contract on the part of the contractor.\u201d\nSection 35 of the \u201cGeneral Conditions\u201d of the contract makes it clear that the engineer referred to is the \u201cChief Engineer of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission acting directly or through an assistant or other representative duly authorized . .\nThe Commission contends that the final quantities were determined on September 17, 1940, when the Chief Engineer sent the plaintiff a final computation of quantities showing the sum due to be $141,057.85. The letter of September 17th read as follows: \u201c. . . We are also transmitting herewith final computation of quantities on your contract. You will note that a correction has been made increasing Item #29. After reviewing the quantities as finally determined you are requested to notify this office as to your acceptance or rejection of the quantities so determined. In the event you concur in the quantities computed by this office we will immediately issue the Final Estimate upon notification from you.\u201d\nOn October 8, 1940, plaintiff by letter \u201crejected said quantities as determined by the Commission\u201d and added \u201cOur excavation subcontractor is not satisfied with the number of cubic yards of borrow excavation.\u201d Correspondence then passed between the parties and on March 20, 1941, the Acting Chief Engineer sent a \u201cfinal estimate to the contractor, which added $75 to the above sum of $141,057.85. No claim for \u201cdamages,\u201d \u201cbalance dne\u201d and \u201cfor additional quantities of work done\u201d was filed by the contractor with, the Chief Engineer until March 14, 1942. This claim was rejected in writing by the Chief Engineer on March 20,-1942, for the reason that it had not been made within thirty days of the determination of final quantities.\nDuring the progress of the work the Chief Engineer wrote on February 8, 1940 to the contractor in reply to the latter\u2019s claim of February 7, 1940, for compensation above contract unit prices for additional costs incurred because of \u201ccertain facts therein set forth,\u201d as follows: \u201c. . . I would refer you to our specifications wherein it is the contractor who has the right to present such claims as he may consider justified to the Commission, such claims to be presented within 30 days after acceptance of quantities indicated in the final estimate.\u201d\nThe word \u201cacceptance\u201d in that letter is to be noted. The contractor\u2019s position is: \u201c1. That the interpretation placed on the contract by the Chief Engineer, that the contractor could apply for arbitration within 30 days after his acceptance of the final quantities is binding under Sec. 49 of the contract. 2. That the Chief Engineer never made any final determination of the quantities on September 17th and never intended so to do. 3. That the subsequent changes by the Chief Engineer in the figures and his statements accompanying the figures that they were subject to modification after consultation with the contractor show clearly that there was no intention on his part to depart from his original position that final determination, needed the approval of the contractor.\u201d\nThe court below says of the use of the word \u201cacceptance\u201d that it was \u201cvery unfortunate\u201d and \u201cmight have misled the contractor,\u201d but that if the contractor had examined the contract he would have discovered the Chief Engineer\u2019s error in using this word. In Hague v. Philadelphia, 48 Pa. 527, this court pointed out \u201cthe folly of the contractor\u201d relying on directions \u201cto proceed outside the contract.\u201d It there said: \u201cHe [the contractor] knew the extent of their [the county commissioners] powers defined in the law, and referred to in the face of his written contract.\u201d\nSec. 4 of the Act of May 28,1937, P. L. 774 provides, inter alia, that \u201call contracts and agreements relating to the construction of the turnpike and connecting tunnels and bridges shall be approved by the Department of Highways, and the turnpike and connecting tunnels and bridges shall be constructed under the supervision of the Department of Highways.\u201d It follows that the Chief Engineer had no power to change the terms and conditions of the contract, and the contractor is bound to take notice of that fact. We cannot interpret Sec. 49 of the contract which gives the Engineer the power \u201cto give orders, explain and decide\u201d and particularly the power to \u201cdetermine the amount or quantity of the several kinds of work and the quality of materials which are to be paid for under this contract\u201d and to \u201cdetermine all questions in relation to the project and the construction thereof\u201d and to \u201cdecide every question which may arise relative to the performance of the work covered by the contract on the part of the contractor\u201d as giving him the authority to modify paragraph 80 of the General Conditions which provides for the arbitration of \u201call questions or disputes respecting any matter pertaining to this contract\u201d and also contains the imperative 30-day provision quoted in the third paragraph of this opinion.\nWe agree with the court below that the Arbitration Act of May 20,1937, P. L. 728, does not give the plaintiff the right to arbitrate his claim regardless of the provisions of the contract. There being in the contract between the parties an arbitration agreement, its terms must be complied with as a prerequisite to the right to arbitrate. We hold that the provision in the contract that reference of question in dispute \u201cmust be made\u201d within thirty (30) days \u201cafter final quantities have been determined\u201d is an express \u201ccondition precedent\u201d to such arbitration. See Britex Co., Ltd. v. Schwab & Sons, Inc., 139 Pa. Superior Ct. 474.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed."}
