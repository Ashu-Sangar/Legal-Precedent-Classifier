{"id": "1174499", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Schaffer,\nThe appellants seek to surcharge the committee of a lunatic. They were unsuccessful in the court below, which unanimously dismissed their exceptions to the account.\nTheir animadversion to the committee\u2019s conduct in the main arises out of its holding of certain securities, received by it as part of the lunatic\u2019s estate, during a rapid decline in tbeir market price. They argue their contentions as if the rules which apply to the management of trust estates are applicable to the acts of committees in lunacy, and as if it Avas the duty of the committee to convert the non-legal securities belonging to the lunatic into cash. Such is not the law. In the very recent case of Davidson\u2019s Est., 323 Pa. 113, 116, 185 A. 782, we pointed out that, \u201cLunatics, their property, proceedings affecting them and their status before the courts, are in a class apart from all others: Riebel\u2019s Est., 321 Pa. 145, 184 Atl. 118. The committee is the mere bailiff of the court which appoints him: Blade\u2019s Gase, 18 Pa. 434. The lunatic is in effect the ward of the court and his estate is in custodia legis: Shaffer v. List, 114 Pa. 486, 7 Atl. 791.\u201d It is always to be borne in mind that the estate is the estate of the lunatic, and that he may regain his reason; when he does his property is to be handed back to him: Wright\u2019s App., 8 Pa. 57; Riebel\u2019s Est., 321 Pa. 145, 184 A. 118. There is ordinarily no duty on a committee in lunacy to convert non-legal securities acquired by the lunatic while sui juris: Riebel\u2019s Est., supra; Davidson\u2019s Est., 324 Pa. 90, 95, 186 A. 796. The lunatic\u2019s property can be sold only under the court\u2019s direction as outlined by the Act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 589, 50 P. S. Sec. 691 et seq. Section 21, 50 P. S. Sec. 754, of that act provides that, if the income of the estate shall not be sufficient to take care of the lunatic, his family, his debts, etc., it shall be lawful for the committee, under the court\u2019s directions, to apply so much of the principal of the personal estate as shall be necessary for the purpose. It was in carrying out this provision that the court made the order which appears in the record empowering the committee to sell the securities. This was not, and, under the circumstances, could not have been a general direction to the committee to realize on the securities belonging to the lunatic. It was simply an authorization to the committee to convert the stocks and other securities belonging to the lunatic into cash from time to time as occasion might demand and within the discretion of the committee. The fact that the committee did not sell certain of the securities, and that they declined in value, formed no basis for a surcharge. The auditor, appointed by the court below, found that the committee \u201cexercised normally good judgment based on a consideration of existing conditions.\u201d This finding was affirmed by the court below. It can only be disturbed for \u201cflagrant error\u201d (Davidson\u2019s Est., 324 Pa. 90, 186 A. 796) which does not appear here.\nThe order of the court, authorizing the payment of counsel fees to attorneys who represented the committee in resisting the attempt to surcharge, the amount of the fees to be fixed by the court, was entirely proper: Biddle\u2019s App., 83 Pa. 340; Price\u2019s App., 116 Pa. 410, 9 A. 856; Davidson\u2019s Est., 300 Pa. 26, 150 A. 152; Harding v. Harding, 305 Pa. 572, 158 A. 253.\nOther criticisms of the committee are inconsequential.\nDecree affirmed at appellants\u2019 cost."}
