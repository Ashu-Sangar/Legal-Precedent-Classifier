{"id": "462733", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nPlaintiff appeals from judgment for defendants in this suit for damages resulting from the freezing of plants shipped in interstate commerce and described by the shipper as \u201chighly perishable.\u201d Jury trial was waived. The case was thoroughly considered by Judge Milner; judgment was entered on his findings after they were approved by the court in banc; they have the effect of a verdict of a jury: Athens Nat. Bank v. Ridgebury Twp., 303 Pa. 479, 483, 154 A. 791.\nPlaintiff, January 5, 19.42, shipped by motor truck thirty-two boxes, each 44 inches long, 20 inches high and 22 inches wide, containing about 16,000 dormant budded rose bushes, from Newark, New York, consigned to Florex Gardens, North Wales, Pennsylvania, the route being from Newark to Rochester, New York, thence to Philadelphia, thence to North Wales, Pennsylvania. The initial carrier, Goetzman and Newman, issued a bill of lading or shipping receipt in the usual form.\nThe transaction is governed by federal law: Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. Martin, 283 U. S. 209, 213, 51 Sup. Ct. 453. The plants were frozen and of no value when delivered to the consignee, facts making a prima facie case against defendants. The defendants are liable unless the record shows they discharged their obligation to transport and deliver: 49 USCA sections 20(11) (12); 49 USCA section 319; compare Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. v. Thompson Mfg. Co., 270 U. S. 416, 46 Sup. Ct. 318.\nPlaintiff, in its statement of claim, avers that the shipment was \u201cin a class known as \u2018perishable\u2019 \u201d; that the boxes containing the plants \u201c. . . bore instructions that the contents were perishable, easily frozen, and must be kept from extreme heat or cold. ... 23. By reason of the negligence of the defendants in not protecting the said goods from cold and their negligent detention and delay in the transportation of the said goods, as aforesaid, the same were on their arrival at point of destination wholly spoiled and unfit for use, and wholly lost to the Plaintiff.\u201d In other words, plaintiff charges (1) negligence \u201cin not protecting . . . from cold\u201d and (2) negligent \u201cdetention and delay.\u201d\nThe learned judge, whose duty it was to find the facts, found that the damage \u201c. . . was not caused by any negligent act or fault on the part of the defendants, but was caused by the inherent natiire of the goods shipped, and natural causes, the risks of which the plaintiff, as shipper, assumed.\u201d Defendants were not insurers against loss resulting from the inherent nature of the plants.\nWe need not discuss plaintiff\u2019s argument on the burden of proof; the evidence is in the record; the only question now is whether the law was correctly applied to the evidence. If, on the evidence, a jury could not find for the defendants, the judgment must be set aside.\nDefendant carriers had filed tariffs stating their services, rates and regulations. These tariffs bound all parties, involved in the transaction and have the force and effect of an Act of Congress: Rau v. Wilkes-Barre R. R. Co., 311 Pa. 510, 513, 167 A. 230; Boston & Maine R. R. v. Hooker, 233 U. S. 97, 34 Sup. Ct. 526.\nOn January 5,1942, at about 8:30 A. M., at Newark, N. Y., plaintiff delivered the shipment to Goetzman and Newman, and received from them the bill of lading which is the basis of this suit. Goetzman and Newman transported the boxes in a closed truck to the terminal of defendant, Mushroom Transportation Company (hereafter called Mushroom) in Rochester, New York. This depot was a large garage containing loading and unloading platforms for handling freight. We quote the learned trial judge\u2019s statement of the movement of the shipment. On the same day Mushroom \u201c. . . loaded about half of the shipment on a truck which left Rochester on January 5th, at; eight o\u2019clock, P. M., and arrived in Williamsport, Pennsylvania on January 6th at 3:45 A. M., and which after a fifteen minute layover in order to change drivers and refuel, left Williamsport at 4 A. M. and arrived in Philadelphia on January 6th at 1:30 P. M. The balance of the. shipment was loaded on another truck which left Rochester on January 6th and after a similar stop at Williamsport left that City on January 7th at 5 o\u2019clock A. M. and arrived in Philadelphia on January 7th at 11:30 A. M. These trucks were of the \u2018closed van type with a.closed top\u2019 and two full length rear doors, with , a tail gate which closed over the rear doors and completely sealed the rear of the vans. The Mushoom Transportation. Company had only one truck scheduled for the Philadelphia run on January 5th, and this truck had only capacity for about one-half of the shipment or 19 boxes. The remaining thirteen boxes were kept on a dock in the back part of its garage until they were shipped the next day. The dock was described as a platform built out about 60 feet from the back wall of the garage which was 200 feet long. The trucks or vans in which the boxes were shipped were neither heated nor refrigerated. The side walls of the vans were of metal ribbed and lined with a veneer, affording an air pocket of about 4 or 6 inches between the metal and the veneer. The back doors were also metal, veneered inside and were solid.\n\u201cBickley\u2019s auto express was notified by Mushroom Transportation Company to pick up the first shipment on January 6th, 1942, at about 3 o\u2019clock P. M. Bickley\u2019s sent a truck to Mushroom Transportation Company\u2019s depot at 1303 N. Front Street, in Philadelphia, and the driver reported with the first shipment at Bickley\u2019s Philadelphia platform at 407 Callowhill Street, Philadelphia, at about 4:30 P. M. and was instructed by Mr. Bickley to take the loaded truck to Bickley\u2019s garage at Jenkintown, Pennsylvania. The cases were taken from the platform of the Mushroom Transportation Company in Philadelphia about 4:30 P. M. on January 6th. It is only about a five minute drive from Mushroom Transportation Company\u2019s platform to BicHeys. The drive to Jenkintown garage takes about 35 minutes. Mr. Bickley testified that it was too late to make the same day delivery, so the truck was sent to Bickley\u2019s Jenkintown garage, where it arrived at about 5:30 o\u2019clock P. M. and was kept there overnight. The truck was a panel body closed truck, with a solid top and the rear was closed by a slotted gate over which a tarpaulin was drawn. The garage at Jenkintown was constructed of stone and brick with a capacity of about 10 trucks, and is equipped with one door on each side by which it may be closed. Th\u00e9 walls are 18 inches thick. It is an enclosed garage. It is not heated.\n\u201cOn January 7th at about two o\u2019clock P. M. Bickley was notified by Mushroom Transportation Company that the second shipment had arrived. Bickley picked up this shipment at about 4:30 o\u2019clock P. M. and sent the truck to the Jenkintown garage where it was kept overnight. The second shipment apparently ivas made in the same type of truck as was the first shipment. The first shipment was forwarded from Jenkintown on January 7th at about 7:30 o\u2019clock A. M. and reached North Wales at 8:30 or 9 o\u2019clock A. M. The second shipment was sent out to North Wales at about the same time the next day, January 8th. The trucks were not heated nor refrigerated.\u201d\nThe southern terminus of the route of Mushroom Transportation Company in Pennsylvania, is Philadelphia; North Wales, the destination of the shipment is not on Mushroom\u2019s tariff route. The bill of lading provided that each carrier \u201c. . . agrees to carry to its usual place of delivery at said destination, if on its own road . . . otherwise to deliver to another carrier on the route to said destination.\u201d When Mushroom brought the shipments to its terminal in Philadelphia, it was required, by the contract, to deliver them to \u201canother carrier on the route to said destination.\u201d To comply with that obligation, Mushroom delivered them to the other defendant, William Bickley, trading as Biekley\u2019s Auto Express, a carrier who delivered at North Wales. The learned judge was therefore right in holding that Bickley\u2019s Auto Express was not performing a mere switching service but was participating in the line haul as delivering carrier: 49 USCA section 20(11).\nThe record contains a stipulation signed by counsel for the parties: \u201c1. That the average mean temperature prevailing in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on January 6,1942, was fifteen degrees above zero; ... on January 7,1942, was eighteen degrees above zero; and . . . on January 8,1942, was eleven degrees above zero . . .\u201d They also stipulated that the meteorological summary of the Weather Bureau of United States Department of Commerce, \u201c. . . may be considered by the hearing Judge with the same force and effect as though the original records had been produced and read into evidence at the trial of the case.\u201d We have examined this summary and observe that the maximum temperature on January 6th was 19\u00b0 and the minimum 11\u00b0; for January 7th, the maximum was 22\u00b0 and the minimum 14\u00b0; for January 8th, the maximum was 16\u00b0 and the minimum 6\u00b0.\nThe plants had been grown in California, and when delivered by the plaintiff to the initial carrier, were in the same boxes in which they had been received by plaintiff from California by rail some weeks before, except that plaintiff placed a double wrapping of paper on the boxes. The manetti roots, on which the rose bushes were budded, were packed in moist moss (called, by a witness, \u201cspagma moss\u201d) to protect and nourish the roots, and the upper part of the plant, described as \u201cabout six or seven inches long,\u201d was covered with excelsior to allow circulation of air. Plaintiff had placed on each box stickers or labels stating, \u201cThis Box Contains Live Plants, \u2014 Highly Perishable, \u2014 Must Be Kept From Extreme Heat or Cold, \u2014 Easily Frozen, \u2014 Transfer Points Please Protect From Extreme Heat or Cold.\u201d Each also contained a sticker containing the words, \u201cPerishable! Keep From Heat or Cold.\u201d\nWhen the shipments were delivered at North Wales, almost all the plants were frozen and the shipment was worthless.\nDefendants operated no heated trucks and had no heated terminal stations; the freight tariffs provided for transportation in unheated trucks and contained no provision that shipments at rest in their terminals would be protected by artificial heat. The consignor and the consignee were bound by the tariffs; the regulation against unlawful discrimination prohibited the carriers from rendering service not provided for in the tariffs. The evidence supports the faet, implicit in the conclusion of the learned judge, that defendants omitted nothing, provided for by their tariffs, that would prevent subjecting the plants \u201cto extreme heat or cold,\u201d while in transit or at rest. The evidence is that in defendant\u2019s Rochester terminal, they were kept at an appropriate place until loaded into the truck for transportation. The fact that the shipment went forward in two parts, instead of at the same time, apparently had nothing to do with its freezing because both shipments, though transported a day apart, were frozen when delivered at des-, tination. If anything, the inference from the division of the consignment and its shipment in two parts on successive days on both of which the plants froze, would be that the transportation in unheated vehicles during the low temperature prevailing and to be expected at that time of the year was an error of judgment on the part of the shipper. The stop at Williamsport for refueling, etc., was a contemplated necessity of the transportation and not inconsistent with defendant\u2019s obligation. The time taken for their transfer, at the Philadelphia terminus, to Bickley for transportation to North Wales, was not unreasonable as is implied in the learned judge\u2019s conclusion. Bickley had no night delivery service and therefore took the shipment to his. garage at Jenkintown, about one-third the distance to North Wales, where they were kept in the closed truck in a closed garage which constituted his terminal station. There is no evidence of detention or delay. <\nThere was expert evidence that rose bushes, packed as these are described to have been packed, would, unless unduly exposed, stand a temperature of 15\u00b0 and even lower for a short time. The weather bureau records show, the temperature fell to 6\u00b0. The expert also thought that \u201cto bring about the condition\u201d in which they were delivered, would require the plants to be subjected to \u201cfive or six hours, or possibly seven hours exposure\u201d of the boxes. The evidence supports a finding that there were no such long periods of exposure. The value of the opinion evidence was, of course, for the trier of facts: compare Ray v. Philadelphia, 344 Pa. 439, 25 A. 2d 145; Com. v. Shults, 221 Pa. 466, 70 A. 823. The plaintiff specified on the boxes that tbe plants were \u201chighly perishable\u201d and were \u201ceasily frozen.\u201d From tbe evidence, we cannot say that the learned judge erred in finding as facts that, within tbe limits of tbe service proposed by tbeir tariffs, defendants bad kept tbe shipments \u201cfrom extreme beat or cold.\u201d We must reject appellant\u2019s argument that this was not a perishable shipment, though so descibed by it. To keep tbe roots alive, they were packed in moist moss. This moisture froze and destroyed tbe roots. Tbe consignee testified \u201cthe roots were frozen.\u201d Tbe degree or extent of the freezing is indicated by part of another answer given by this witness: \u201cSome of tbe boxes were frozen sufficiently that we bad to use tbe strength of an ordinary man\u2019s bands to break tbe moss . . .\u201d It is common knowledge that moisture subjected to low enough temperature will freeze, whether it be tbe moisture in moss around such roots or moisture in fruit and vegetables. This moisture constituted an inherent infirmity during freezing weather exactly as tbe moisture in fruit and vegetables constituted an infirmity during freezing weather, or during excessive beat. Tbe defendants\u2019 tariffs did not provide that defendants must insure against tbe effect of this natural law. Tbe court found they omitted no duty of care.\nTbe evidence supports tbe conclusion that tbe damage resulted from tbe shipment of property liable to freeze during tbe low temperatures stated above, in unheated transportation facilities and that defendants performed tbeir contract of carriage without negligence.\nJudgment affirmed.\nDefendants bad been joined pursuant to Pa. R. C. P. 2229(b).\nSection 2(a) of the bill of lading provided: \u201cNo carrier is bound to transport said property by any particular train or vessel, or in time for any particular market, or otherwise than with reasonable dispatch.\u201d\nCompare Blodget Co. v.
