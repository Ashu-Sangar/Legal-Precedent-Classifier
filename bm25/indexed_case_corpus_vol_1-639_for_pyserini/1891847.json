{"id": "1891847", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nOn April 18, 1962, after being advised by tbe court of tbe consequences of Ms plea, appellant, represented by two able counsel, entered a plea of guilty to murder generally. The Commonwealth certified that the evidence would rise no higher than murder in the second degree, and the court proceeded to take testimony to determine the degree of guilt and the sentence to be imposed.\nOn September 26, 1961, appellant and the victim had an argument in a poolroom. Appellant left, but indicated he would return. He was intoxicated at the time of the argument. Approximately twenty minutes later, appellant, still intoxicated, returned with a shotgun. The owner of the poolroom testified that appellant first pointed the weapon at him. As the victim started to leave, appellant turned in his direction, asked, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d and shot him in the side. It was stipulated that death resulted from this wound.\nAppellant testified and contended that the weapon was accidentally fired when the victim grabbed it. Appellant stated that he couldn\u2019t \u201cactually say\u201d whether or not he pulled the trigger.\nThe trial court concluded that appellant was guilty of murder in the second degree and imposed a sentence of not less than ten nor more than twenty years. No motion to withdraw the plea was made, and no appeal followed.\nOn June 18, 1963, appellant filed the petition for writ of habeas corpus which is now before us. It was denied without a hearing.\nPetitioner contends that the evidence was not sufficient to support the judgment of the court and that the victim\u2019s death was accidental. Furthermore, he urges that the sentence imposed does not fit the offense charged.\nAppellant, in this Court, attached a supplemental petition raising matters which do not appear of record in the court below and which we shall not pass upon here.\nIt has long been established that habeas corpus is not a substitute for an appeal. Even if we assume arguendo that appellant\u2019s contentions may be raised in a petition for habeas corpus, we are satisfied that the evidence amply supports the trial judge\u2019s determination that appellant is guilty of murder in the second degree. Review of the record fully justifies the court\u2019s observation.\nNo proof legally capable of absolving appellant from the responsibility and accountability for his behavior was offered. Appellant cannot now successfully contend that the victim\u2019s death was accidental in the absence of proof at trial and in the face of a proper finding to the contrary.\nThe sentence imposed is obviously authorized by The Penal Code, June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, \u00a7701, as amended, 18 P.S. \u00a74701. Neither the petition nor the record reveal any basis justifying the issuance of the writ. The petition was properly denied without a hearing.\nOrder affirmed."}
