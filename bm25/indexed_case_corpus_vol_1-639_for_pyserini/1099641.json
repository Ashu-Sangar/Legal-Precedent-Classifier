{"id": "1099641", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nBy its bill in equity in this case, plaintiff sought to compel the defendant coal company to comply with a covenant for further assurances, appearing in a mortgage given by it to plaintiff,' as trustee for bondholders, so far as related to a specified coal property, acquired by defendant after the date of the mortgage, and also to pay to plaintiff the stipulated amount per ton for coal mined from that property. Defendant answered, and the case was tried in due course, resulting in a final decree in favor of plaintiff, from which this appeal is taken.\nBy the covenant referred to, defendant agreed \u201cfrom time to time to make, do, execute, acknowledge and deliver such further acts, deeds, covenants and assurances in the law as may be reasonably advised or required for effectuating the intention of these presents, and for the better assuring or confirming to the trustee......all and singular the property, real, personal and mixed,____ either now owned or possessed, or hereafter owned, possessed or acquired\u201d by it.\nDefendant admits that it later acquired and now owns the property referred to; that it has been mining coal therefrom and has not paid to plaintiff the stipulated amount per ton; that the clause in its mortgage covering after-acquired property is valid (Phila., Wilmington & Baltimore R. R. Co. v. Woelpper, 64 Pa. 366); and that it can be required to make such assurances and such payments with respect to all after-acquired property which is fairly within the covenant quoted, but avers that the land described in the bill is not within the terms of that covenant. Stated specifically, defendant\u2019s contention is that, since paragraph sixth of the mortgage recites under what circumstances certain after-acquired property may be obtained, and in terms subjects it, if thus obtained, to the lien of the mortgage, this operates to limit the meaning of the clause \u201call..... the property......hereafter owned, possessed or acquired\u201d by defendant, appearing in the covenant quoted and in several other places in the bonds and mortgage.\nTo this we cannot assent. The main purpose of paragraph sixth is to provide for squaring defendant\u2019s property lines with those of adjoining owners, and for selling such parts of the mortgaged premises as are no longer useful or necessary to the company \u2014 in each case freed and discharged of the lien of the mortgage. With, out such a provision the power to sell might be held not to exist. Being given expressly, however, it became necessary to fix the status of the land acquired by defendant in squaring the lines, and of the funds obtained on the sale of the property no longer needed in defendant\u2019s business. It was, therefore, provided that the funds might, under the conditions specified, be invested in other coal property, and that this land, and that received in exchange when squaring the property lines, should be subject to the lien of the mortgage, and a supplemental mortgage should be executed to accomplish the same purpose. As if this were not sufficient, the paragraph later repeats that \u201cAll property taken in exchange, or acquired with the proceeds of sales, shall immediately be and become subject to the lien of this mortgage in the same manner and to the same extent as if now included therein.\u201d It is clear to us that each and all of these repetitions were inserted only ex majori cautela, not as limiting the all-inclusive language elsewhere appearing, but rather in order to forestall a possible contention that properties acquired under the conditions stated in this paragraph were not to be covered by the lien of the mortgage; thus making certain that such a limitation was not intended under any circumstances. While the unnecessary provisions for a supplemental mortgage and for subjecting the same property to the old mortgage, furnished an opportunity for an ingenius argument, to which we listened with interest, they do not, when properly weighed, cast the slightest doubt on the intention to subject all defendant\u2019s after-acquired property to the lien of the mortgage.\nAnother consideration leads to the same conclusion. If the sixth paragraph defines all the after-acquired property which is to become thus subject, then franchises and later acquired personalty, no matter how essential they may be to the operation of the coal mines as going concerns, do not become liable, though the main purpose of the mortgage was to protect the bondholders by making \u201call the property, real, personal and mixed, and all the rights, privileges and franchises of the coal company now owned or hereafter acquired\u201d subject to the lien. That appellant\u2019s argument leads to the conclusion stated, is evident from the fact that, though the sixth paragraph gives to defendant \u201cthe right at all times to alter, replace, change, add to, repair, and dispose of, any and all machinery and fixtures,\u201d it is only the \u201cproperty taken in exchange\u201d in squaring the lines, and \u201creal estate\u201d acquired with the proceeds of sales of unneeded property, that is therein stated to \u201cbecome subject to the lien of this mortgage.\u201d This necessary result of defendant\u2019s contention definitely proves that it cannot be sustained. It\u2019 is true, as appellant contends, that it \u201cmust clearly appear from the language of the [mortgage] that [it was] the manifest intention of the parties\u201d that after-acquired property should be covered by it, but here admittedly it was so intended, and our question is whether it was after-acquired property generally, or only that obtained in the ways specified in paragraph sixth. We are satisfied it was the former.\nWe have not overlooked the further assertion that the mortgage, so far as after-acquired property is concerned, should be held to relate to property contiguous to the tracts particularly described, but neither paragraph sixth, nor any other provision in the mortgage, either directly or inferentially so provides. In paragraph sixth, there is no limitation as to the location of land to be acquired with the proceeds of unneeded property sold. Nor is there the slightest intimation of such a limitation elsewhere. Everywhere it is said that all after-acquired property is to be subject to the lien of the mortgage, and we can only repeat that \u201call\u201d means all.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed at the cost of appellant."}
