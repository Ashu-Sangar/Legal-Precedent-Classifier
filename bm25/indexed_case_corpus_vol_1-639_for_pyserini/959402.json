{"id": "959402", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Mitchell,\nIf the testator had devised the house to his wife and then directed the conversion of all the rest of his real estate, there would have been no doubt, and yet the meaning is clearly the same. What he said was that the real estate should be converted into cash with the exception of the property at Dana and Grove streets, which should be \u201c held in reserve for his widow.\u201d The expression, \u201c held in reserve,\u201d is not apt, nor in itself entirely clear, but the testator certainly meant the house was not to be converted. His wife was to have it, and the expression, \u201c held in reserve,\u201d must be taken as equivalent to what he said about the piano for his daughter, that it was to be \u201c set apart \u201d for her. It being clear, therefore, that he meant the house to go to his wife in the first instance, the statutory presumption is that his entire estate in it passed to her. There is no devise over or anything showing contrary intent.\nJudgment affirmed."}
