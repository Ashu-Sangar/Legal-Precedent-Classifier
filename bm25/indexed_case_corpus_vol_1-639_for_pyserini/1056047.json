{"id": "1056047", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe testator, who died September 20, 1912, thus disposed of his estate: \u201cI give, devise and bequeath to my beloved wife, Catharine McCandless Jennings, all my property, real, personal and mixed, of what kind or character soever and wheresoever the same may be situate, for and during the term of her natural life, and at her death I direct that the same be divided between my three children share and share alike, and in the event of the death of any of said children leaving a child or children, such child or children to take the'share of their parent.\u201d Catharine McCandless Jennings survived her husband, as did his three children, a daughter, Catharine, and two sons, Charles and Richard. The daughter died in her minority, March 22, 1918, intestate, unmarried and without issue. The court below, being of opinion that her interest in her father\u2019s estate was vested, awarded her share in it to her personal representative for future accounting to those entitled thereto. From this the Union Trust Company, of Pittsburgh, executor and testamentary trustee under the will of testator, has appealed.\nThe daughter, Catharine, was in esse at her father\u2019s death; he fixed her mother\u2019s death as the time when she was to come into possession of her share in his estate; the bequest was not qualified, but absolute; no precedent condition was attached to it, and the time fixed for the enjoyment of it was not expressly or by implication annexed to the gift. The interest clearly vested at testator\u2019s death: Carstensen\u2019s Est., 196 Pa. 325; Bair\u2019s Est., 255 Pa. 169; McCauley\u2019s Est., 257 Pa. 377. In Marshall\u2019s Est., 262 Pa. 145, the gift was a mere direction to pay, but it was held vested, because \u201cThough there be no other gift than in the direction to pay or distribute in futuro, yet if such gift or distribution appears to be postponed for the convenience of the fund or property, or where the gift is only postponed to let in some other interest, the vesting will not be deferred till the period in question. Thus where stock is bequeathed to A. for life, and after his decease to trustees, upon trust to sell and pay, and divide the proceeds to and between C. and D.; as the payment or distribution is evidently deferred until the decease of A., for the purpose of giving. precedence to his life interest, the ulterior legatees take a vested interest at- the decease of the testator: 1 Jarm. on Wills, 764.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed and decree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
