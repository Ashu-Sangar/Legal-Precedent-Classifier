{"id": "1213340", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County dismissing an appeal from the probate of a writing offered as a will. Fred P. Wenz, the decedent, owned a fractional interest in certain gas wells in Ohio, the production of which was being sold to a fuel company. Agents were appointed by the owners of the fractional interests to receive payments for the gas and distribute the same among the owners. One of these agents visited the decedent, who was in a hospital, and requested written instructions and authority in case of decedent\u2019s death to deduct the decedent\u2019s pro rata share of expenses and taxes from the receipts. The decedent then wrote the following:\n\u201cPittsburgh, Pa.\nAug. 22, \u201941.\nMr. Karl Knapp,\nTrustee\nIn case of my death without having made a will it is my wish and desire that all money derived from Licking Co. Gas wells, and my Pro-rata share of any expenses and taxes are deducted, be paid to\nMrs. Anna M. Conroy 1450\nChartiers Ave., McKees Rocks, Pa.\n(Signed) Peed P. Wenz.\u201d\nThe decedent died seven days later, unmarried, leaving to survive him as his heirs at law two sisters and a minor nephew, under the guardianship of the latter\u2019s father. Wenz left a personal estate, exclusive of the portion of the estate subject to this controversy, of $30,102.86. At the time of his death there had accumulated in the hands of the trustee of the fund from the gas wells the sum of $222.28.\nThe opponents of the probate of the above writing say that the decedent did not intend it to operate either as a will or as a testamentary gift or disposition, and they contend that this case is ruled by Tyson\u2019s Est., 336 Pa. 497, 9 A.2d 733. In that case this court held that a letter from decedent to his sister saying: \u201cI am making out my will leaving securities to you.\u201d, did not constitute a will. There the decedent was obviously referring to another paper as Ms will, and no such paper was ever found.\nIn the instant case the paper probated was testamentary in character. The fact that it was addressed to \u201cKarl Knapp, Trustee\u201d is of no materiality. \u201cThe mere fact that the will was in the form of a letter does not affect the result: Knox\u2019s Est., 131 Pa. 220; Scott\u2019s Est., 147 Pa. 89.\u201d: Davis\u2019s Est., 275 Pa. 126, 129, 118 A. 645.\nAppellants argue with considerable plausibility that the letter in question \u201cwas merely a direction to the agent as such, and was intended for his, the agent\u2019s, guidance and protection.\u201d, but appellants concede that \u201cwhen the decedent died, the agency and all further authority of the agent to act thereunder ended.\u201d Appellants also argue that \u201cwhen Knapp heard the decedent was in the hospital, he visited him there and attempted to obtain directions or authority for continuing the deduction of decedent\u2019s pro rata share of taxes and expenses after decedent\u2019s death.\u201d The weakness of that argument is that the decedent in the paper he signed went further than merely authorizing the deductions of his pro rata share of taxes and expenses and declared that after these deductions were made that the balance of the gas wells royalties should \u201cin case of\u201d his \u201cdeath without having made a will ... be paid to Mrs. Anna M. Conroy.\u201d It is true that the phrase \u201cwithout having made a will\u201d tends to support appellants\u2019 contention that the paper in question was not a will, but it is a legitimate inference from all the circumstances that what decedent meant by that phrase was this: \u201cwithout making a formal will disposing of all of my property\u201d. Knapp was a mere collector of these royalties and it is conceded that his duty was \u201cto distribute the same among the parties in interest\u201d. Wenz in the challenged paper gave Knapp explicit directions as to what he should do with the net proceeds of Wenz\u2019s share of these royalties after Wenz\u2019s death and that direction was to pay these proceeds to Mrs. Conroy. Wenz made Mrs. Conroy \u201ca party in interest\u201d as soon as he should die.\nIt is also true, as appellants contend, that \u201cthe fact that this decedent sought to protect his agent\u2019s authority beyond decedent\u2019s lifetime, and failed in that attempt, does not justify the lower court\u2019s conclusion that a will was intended.\u201d The conclusion challenged is not justified ~by that fact alone. The fact that this paper is in law either a will in respect to the decedent\u2019s share of the gas royalties or it is nothing is a fact which with other facts in the case was proper for the court\u2019s consideration in determining whether or not it was a will. In McCune\u2019s Est., 265 Pa. 523, 109 A. 156, this court said in substance that the test of whether or not a paper signed by a decedent was his will is: Was it \u201cintended as a post-humous destination of the maker\u2019s property?\u201d Wenz placed no limitation on Mrs. Conroy\u2019s possession of this share of his property once these proceeds were paid to her after his death. He did not designate her as a custodian or agent, nor did he direct that she should turn the royalties over to an administrator of his estate after his death. He did not make her a mere conduit of these proceeds. He could easily have designated Mrs. Conroy as a mere holder of these proceeds for the benefit of his estate, after his death, but he did not do so, and that fact is of legal significance. Wenz was approaching death and it may be inferred that he contemplated it when he executed this paper.\nA paper to be accepted as a will must be not only testamentary in form but it must be signed by a decedent with a testamentary intent. \u201cThe animus testandi is an indispensable ingredient\u201d of a will: Stein\u2019s Lessee v. North, 3 Yeates\u2019 Reports 324. As proof of the absence of this ingredient, appellants cite the testimony of Mrs. Agnes Myers, a nurse at the hospital, who secured the pen and paper at Knapp\u2019s request, which Wenz used in writing the paper now before us. She testified that during the writing of the paper Wenz declared that \u201che did not have a will and that he did not intend to make a will at this time\u201d. Mrs. Myers witnessed decedent\u2019s signature but later tore her signature from the paper.\nWe do not agree with appellee that this testimony was incompetent. Whether or not an act done by a person is a jural act often depends on the mental state which accompanies or incites it and that state may be shown by that person\u2019s contemporaneous utterance. What is said when a thing is done is often revelatory of the character of that thing, as we pointed out in Eaton v. N. Y. Life Ins. Co., 315 Pa. 68, 78, 172 A. 121. \u201cThe act itself being admissible, whatever accompanies it and serves to explain its character is relevant and admissible also.\u201d: per Coleridge, J., in Wright v. Tatham, 5 Cl. & F. 670, 693. As to the proof of attendant or extrinsic circumstances when there is a question of the nature of a paper offered as testamentary, see Page on Wills (3rd ed.), Vol. 1, sec. 59, p. 137, and Sunday\u2019s Est., 167 Pa. 30, 31 A. 363. See also Fellbush v. Fellbush, 216 Pa. 141, 65 A. 28.\nThe evidence of Mrs. Myers was considered by the court trying this case. The weight and credibility of her testimony was for the trier\u2019s determination. He, President Judge Teimble, said: \u201cDespite her testimony, his [Wenz\u2019s] writing clearly shows a present testamentary disposition, complete of itself, dependent upon no other paper for fulfillment.\u201d\nThe respective positions of both the proponents and the opponents of the probate of this paper find some support in this record. The case is admittedly a close one, but the record does not require a holding by us that the court below erred in dismissing the exceptions and affirming the decree of the trial judge, who dismissed the appeal from the probate of this paper.\nThe decree is affirmed at appellants\u2019 cost.\nPresumably further sums would be added to this fund in the future. There is a certificate that the amount in controversy in this case is in excess- of $2,500, exclusive of costs.\nThe fact that this witness \u201clater tore her signature\u201d from this paper tends to indicate that she had some animus against its probate as a will."}
