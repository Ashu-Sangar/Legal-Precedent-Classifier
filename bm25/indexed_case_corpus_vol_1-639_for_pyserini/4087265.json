This Court upheld the constitutionality of Sections 3802(a)(2) and 3802(c) in Commonwealth v. Duda, 592 Pa. 164, 923 A.2d 1138 (2007), and Commonwealth v. Finchio, 592 Pa. 577, 926 A.2d 968 (2007), respectively. Although Appellee was charged under Section 3802(b), this Court explained in Finchio that \u201c[t]he difference in the statutory BAC threshold is immaterial to the analysis employed in Duda.\u201d Finchio, 592 Pa. at 581, 926 A.2d at 971. The Commonwealth\u2019s application for relief is dismissed as moot."}
