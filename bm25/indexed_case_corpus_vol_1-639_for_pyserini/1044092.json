{"id": "1044092", "contents": "Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court,\nPer. Curiam.\n\u2014 The warrant of attorney and bond of Mrs. Shallcross were a mere nullity. The entry of judgment on it was not binding on her and can be stricken off. But it does not follow that the bond and warrant are void as to her husband, Samuel S. Shallcross. Being void as to her, it was his bond singly. We see no error in refusing to strike off the judgment as to him.\nJudgment affirmed."}
