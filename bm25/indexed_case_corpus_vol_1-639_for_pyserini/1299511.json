{"id": "1299511", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nTestator died August 11, 1931, leaving a wife, two sons and a daughter to survive him. Robert E. Din-key, one of testator\u2019s sons, died on June 6, 1949, leaving two children (Mardianna D. Green and Helen Lee White) each of whom is still living. . On October 25, 1952, Alva C. Dinkey, Jr., the other son of the testator, died leaving a -widow but no children or issue to survive him. Testator\u2019s widow, the life tenant, died on March 4, 1958, at which time the testamentary residuary trust terminated. The trust principal which was reappraised as of the death of testator\u2019s widow, amounted to $1,626,000. Alva Jr.\u2019s widow claimed one-third of the remainder of the principal of the trust on the theory that her husband took a vested one-third interest in remainder upon the death of the testator.\nThe lower Court denied the claim of Alva Jr.\u2019s widow on the ground that the gift of principal to Alva, Jr. was contingent upon his surviving the life tenant, and awarded one-half of the principal of the trust to testator\u2019s daughter, Leonora, who survived testator\u2019s widow, and one-fourth to each of the two daughters of testator\u2019s deceased son, Robert. In other words, the Orphans\u2019 Court held that the testator intended to give his residuary estate after the death of his widow to his children who survived his widow and the then surviving children, per' stirpes, of his deceased children.\nTestator in the third paragraph of his will dated July 21, 1930, gave his residuary estate in trust to pay from the net income $400 a month to his daughter and to each of his two sons, and the balance of his income to his wife. He then provided (in this third paragraph) : \u201cUpon the death of my said wife, Margaret S. Dinkey, I direct the surviving trustee to divide the trust estate into three equal portions, and to pay the same to my three children, Robert E. Din-key, Alva C. Dinkey, Jr., and Leonora S. Seiple. [We note parenthetically that if the will had stopped at this point, Robert, Alva, Jr., and Leonora would each have had a vested interest in one-third of the remainder, although it would not be payable until the death of testator\u2019s widow. But the will did not stop at this point.]\n\u201cIn case of the death of any of my children prior to the distribution of the trust estate herein provided for I direct that his or her share he paid to his or her surviving children, and if any child shall die without issue surviving him or her Ms or her share shall be divided equally among my surviving children, or their children, such children together taking a parent\u2019s share.\u201d\nIt is by now hornbook law (1) that the testator\u2019s intent is the polestar and must prevail: Hope Estate, 398 Pa. 470, 474, 159 A. 2d 197; Bald Estate, 385 Pa. 176, 122 A. 2d 294; Dunlap Estate, 381 Pa. 328, 331, 112 A. 2d 349; Newlin Estate, 367 Pa. 527, 80 A. 2d 819; and (2) that that intent must be gathered from a consideration of all the language contained in the four corners of his will and not merely from isolated clauses or provisions thereof: Pruner Estate, 400 Pa. 629, 635, 162 A. 2d 626; Wanamaker Estate, 399 Pa. 274, 159 A. 2d 201; Richley Estate, 394 Pa. 188, 146 A. 2d 281; Weaver Estate, 390 Pa. 128, 134 A. 2d 675; and (3) that technical rules or canons of construction should be resorted to only if the language of the will is ambiguous or conflicting or the testator\u2019s intent is for any reason uncertain: Hope Estate, 398 Pa., supra; McFadden Estate, 381 Pa. 464, 112 A. 2d 148; Britt Estate, 369 Pa. 450, 455, 87 A. 2d 243; Edmunds Estate, 374 Pa. 22, 97 A. 2d 75.\nWe are convinced from a careful examination of the entire will, and particularly all the language of the third paragraph of the will (upon which each party relies), that testator gave and intended to give one-third of the principal of his trust estate to each of his children who survived his widow and to the surviving children, per stirpes, of each child who predeceased his widow, and if any child died prior to the distribution of the trust estate without surviving issue, his share shall be divided equally among testator\u2019s surviving children or surviving grandchildren and should not go to a stranger to his blood.\nThe principal contention of Alva, Jr.\u2019s widow is that her husband\u2019s share of the principal, to wit, an absolute interest in one-third of the principal of the trust, vested under the provisions of the first above quoted clause of the third paragraph of the will, upon the death of the testator (although not payable until the death of the widow) and that this vested interest was not made contingent by the subsequent dispositive provision in the third paragraph of testator\u2019s will. This latter provision she contends applies only to income and consequently her husband\u2019s vested interest was not cut down or changed to a contingent interest by this second dispositive provision. First of all, appellant\u2019s contention that this dispositive provision applies only to income is devoid of any merit. Moreover, we cannot read or consider the first dis-positive clause or provision in the third paragraph without reading and considering it in connection with and together with the second dispositive clause or provision of the third paragraph. Considering the two together, the testator\u2019s intention is, we repeat, clear that Alva, Jr. could take one-third of the principal of the trust only if he survived testator\u2019s widow.\nNotwithstanding appellant\u2019s able argument, the testator\u2019s intent is so clear that there is no valid or justifiable reason for resorting to rules or canons of construction which, in the last analysis, have been judicially created merely to aid a Court in ascertaining a testator\u2019s testamentary intent.\nWe agree with the auditing Judge, and we believe it is conceded by both parties, that the question of the distribution of principal in this estate arose for the first time at this audit and that the two prior adjudications of the Court disposing of income alone did not establish the law of the case.\nWe have considered appellant\u2019s alternative interpretation of the will but find no merit in this or in any of her other contentions.\nDecree affirmed; each party to pay own costs.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nTogether with all the surrounding and attendant circumstances and the scheme of distribution.\nIn each of the prior adjudications the Orphans\u2019 Court decited l>y analogy to the dispositive gifts of principal \u2014 there was no express gift\u2019 of income during the lifetime of testator\u2019s widow when a child of testator predeceased testator\u2019s widow \u2014 that the $400 per month income which said child was given in the third paragraph of the will- should be paid to the children or testamentary legatees of a deceased child until the termination of the trust."}
