{"id": "2472438", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice BAER.\nWe granted review in this case to clarify what constitutes a good faith effort by a plaintiff to effectuate notice to a defendant of the commencement of an action. In the seminal case of Lamp v. Heyman, 469 Pa. 465, 366 A.2d 882 (1976), this Court sought to end abuses of process by plaintiffs who tolled the statute of limitations by filing a writ of summons, had the writ repeatedly reissued, and deliberately failed to notify the defendant of the pending litigation. This process, while technically compliant with the Rules of Civil Procedure, nonetheless defeated the purpose of the statute of limitations, which is to protect defendants from stale claims. Accordingly in Lamp, we held that \u201ca writ of summons shall remain effective to commence an action only if the plaintiff then refrains from a course of conduct which serves to stall in its tracks the legal machinery he has just set in motion.\u201d Id. at 889.\nWe revisited the Lamp rule in Farinacci v. Beaver County Industrial Development Authority, 510 Pa. 589, 511 A.2d 757, 759 (1986), wherein we stated that \u201cLamp requires of plaintiffs a good-faith effort to effectuate notice of commencement of the action.\u201d Most recently, we reconsidered the necessary requirements of a \u201cgood faith effort to effectuate notice\u201d in our plurality opinion in Witherspoon v. City of Philadelphia, 564 Pa. 388, 768 A.2d 1079 (2001), wherein the opinion announcing the judgment of the court favored requiring plaintiffs to have process immediately and continually reissued if it could not be served timely.\nThe Superior and Commonwealth Courts have struggled to apply the Lamp-Farinacci rule, with some panels requiring plaintiffs to comply strictly with the Rules of Civil Procedure related to service of process and local practice in order to satisfy the good faith requirement, see, e.g., Teamann v. Zafris, 811 A.2d 52, 63 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002), and other panels providing a more flexible approach, excusing plaintiffs\u2019 initial procedurally defective service where the defendant has actual notice of the commencement of litigation and is not otherwise prejudiced, see, e.g., Leidich v. Franklin, 394 Pa.Super. 302, 575 A.2d 914 (1990). We now adopt the more flexible approach, concluding that it sufficiently protects defendants from defending against stale claims without the draconian action of dismissing claims based on technical failings that do not prejudice the defendant.\nIn this case, Charles F. McCreesh (Appellant) claims that he was seriously injured on August 14, 2000, when a tree, growing on property owned by the City of Philadelphia (\u201cthe City\u201d), fell on his truck while he was traveling on Walnut Street. Appellant commenced the present litigation against the City by filing a Praecipe to Issue a Writ of Summons (\u201cWrit 1\u201d) on August 12, 2002, pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1007, within the applicable two-year statute of limitations. Appellant attempted to serve the City with Writ 1, by sending it to the City Law Department by certified mail. The parties agree that a United States Postal Service employee delivered the package containing Writ 1, and that a receptionist at the Law Department signed for the package on August 13, 2002.\nThere is no indication of any correspondence between Appellant and the City between August 13, 2002, and November 8, 2002, when Appellant filed his complaint alleging negligence and requesting damages not to exceed $50,000. Also on November 8, 2002, Appellant requested the writ\u2019s reissuance (\u201cWrit 2\u201d) in accordance with Pa.R.C.P. 401(b), and served the City Law Department properly by hand delivery by a competent adult, as specified in Pa.R.C.P. 400.1 and 402. The City filed preliminary objections on November 25, 2002, asserting that delivery of Writ 1 by certified mail in August 2002 did not comply with Pa.R.C.P. 400.1, which requires original process in actions commenced in Philadelphia to be served by either the sheriff or a competent adult, and that the complaint filed in November had not been filed within the two-year statute of limitations period. The City posited that the complaint was untimely, Writ 1 was rendered ineffective because of Appellant\u2019s failure to serve properly, and Appellant\u2019s claims were therefore time-barred. Appellant maintained that Writ 1 had been served in compliance with the rules, arguing that the delivery of the writ by the postal worker constituted service by a competent adult.\nIn January 2008, the trial court overruled the City\u2019s preliminary objections. On January 27, 2003, the City requested that the trial court reconsider its order or amend the order to include a statement recommending that the Commonwealth Court grant an immediate appeal of the otherwise interlocutory order. Such amendment was proper, the City argued, because the order involved \u201ca controlling question of law as to which there [was] substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order [might] materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter.\u201d 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 702(b). When the trial court failed to act within thirty days, the petition was deemed denied. See Pa.R.A.P. 1311(b). The City petitioned the Commonwealth Court for review of the interlocutory issue pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1311(b) (\u201cInterlocutory appeals by permission\u201d), which the court granted in May 2003. In response, in June 2003, the trial court filed a brief opinion, stating that Writ 1 was \u201cpresented to the City of Philadelphia by good faith effort.\u201d\nBefore the Commonwealth Court, the City asserted that Appellant\u2019s failure to comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure relating to service failed to satisfy the good faith requirement of Lamp. Consequently, the City argued for the dismissal of the case. The court recognized that the Rules of Civil Procedure require that original process be \u201cserved within the Commonwealth within thirty days after the issuance of the writ or the filing of the complaint,\u201d but allow for repeated reissuance of the writ at \u201cany time and any number of times\u201d if process cannot be served within the thirty-day window. See Pa.R.C.P. 401.\nThe court noted, however, that the Lamp rule requires plaintiffs to make a good faith effort to effectuate notice upon the defendant in order to keep the action alive. The court rejected Appellant\u2019s reliance on Leidich, in which the Superior Court found that a plaintiff, who mailed notice, attempted in good faith to serve the defendant where the plaintiff mistakenly believed that the defendant\u2019s insurance company had consented to service by mail and where the parties exchanged documents in the period between the defective service by mail and the re-issuance and proper service of the writ. Leidich, 575 A.2d at 919-20. The Commonwealth Court distinguished the case sub judice, noting that unlike the plaintiff in Leidich, Appellant had not done \u201canything to keep the legal machinery in play between August 12, 2002 and November 8, 2002.\u201d McCreesh, 839 A.2d at 1212.\nThe Commonwealth Court also relied on its decision in Teamann, 811 A.2d at 62, which required compliance with the Rules of Civil Procedure to find good faith, and in Williams v. SEPTA, 137 Pa.Cmwlth. 163, 585 A.2d 583 (1991), which held that service by mail did not satisfy the Rules of Civil Procedure or the Lamp good faith requirement. McCreesh, 839 A.2d at 1212. Placing the burden of proof on Appellant, the court concluded that Appellant\u2019s delivery of Writ 1 by certified mail to the City in August did not constitute a good faith effort to serve the defendant with process under the Lamp rule because Appellant\u2019s attempt at service did not comply with relevant rules relating to service of process in Philadelphia County. McCreesh, 839 A.2d at 1213. Accordingly, the court reversed the trial court and remanded with directions to dismiss the case.\nAppellant appealed to this Court and we granted review limited to the Lamp issue. Appellant maintains that the Commonwealth Court erred in overturning the decision of the trial court. He asserts that the decision conflicts with Lamp, which was designed to prevent plaintiffs from abusing a loophole in the Rules of Civil Procedure by stalling litigation and providing no notice to defendants of impending claims. Appellant asserts that the trial court acted within its discretion in finding good faith, because Appellant did not act to stall the litigation but instead provided the City with a copy of Writ 1 prior to the expiration of both the statute of limitations and the thirty-day period for service provided by Rule 401. Thus, Appellant maintains, the City suffered no prejudice because it had actual notice that he had commenced litigation regarding the August 12, 2000 accident.\nAppellant draws support from various decisions of the Superior Court that have permitted cases to continue despite technically deficient service where the defendant has actual notice of the litigation and is not prejudiced by the lack of strict compliance with the Rules of Civil Procedure. He maintains that these cases strike the appropriate balance between protecting defendants from unfair surprise and prejudice and plaintiffs from the harsh sanction of dismissal for non-prejudicial procedural missteps. He further argues that this balance comports with the policy expressed in Pa.R.C.P. 126, which provides that the Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cshall be liberally construed\u201d and that courts \u201cat every stage of any such action or proceeding may disregard any error or defect of procedure which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.\u201d Thus, he argues that the Commonwealth Court erred in overturning the decision of the trial court where Appellant did not stall the legal machinery, and the City received actual notice of his litigation and was not prejudiced by the defective service.\nConversely, the City argues that this Court should follow the cases that equate good faith with a plaintiffs strict compliance with the Rules of Civil Procedure. The City excerpts sentences from the decisions in Lamp and Farinacci, which state that plaintiffs must comply with local practice. Lamp, 366 A.2d at 889 (\u201c[A] plaintiff should comply with local practice____\u201d); Farinacci, 511 A.2d at 759 (\u201cPlaintiffs are required to comply with local practice to ensure, insofar as they are able, prompt service of process.\u201d) The City also directs our attention to those Superior Court and Commonwealth Court cases that have required strict compliance with the rules of procedure in order to satisfy the good faith requirement of Fannacci. Moreover, the City attempts to distinguish those cases that permit deviation from the Rules of Civil Procedure, noting that, unlike the case at bar, the parties in Leidich were engaged in on-going discovery during the period between the faulty service and the eventual proper service. The City also notes that in Leidich the defendant arguably misled the plaintiff by engaging in settlement negotiations for several months without mentioning the issue of improper service until after the expiration of the statute of limitations, while in the instant case, the City did nothing to lead Appellant to believe that service would not be an issue in the case. The City asserts that a lack of prejudice to the defendant is irrelevant to the failure to comply with the relevant rules of procedure.\nIn deciding whether the Commonwealth Court erred or abused its discretion in overturning the trial court\u2019s denial of the City\u2019s preliminary objection, we must first determine whether to adopt the strict approach of cases such as the case sub judice and Teamann, which require rigid compliance with the Rules of Civil Procedure in order to satisfy the Lamp test, or the more flexible approach of the Leidich line of cases, which allows for the continued validity of the writ despite noncompliance with the rules so long as the defendant received actual notice and was not prejudiced.\nWe initially consider the policy considerations that have informed the development of the law in this area. We have long recognized that the \u201cpurpose of any statute of limitations is to expedite litigation and thus discourage delay and the presentation of stale claims which may greatly prejudice the defense of such claims.\u201d Insurance Co. of N. Amer. v. Carnahan, 446 Pa. 48, 284 A.2d 728, 729 (1971). To this end, our legislature has enacted statutes of limitations that require actions to be \u201ccommenced\u201d within certain time-frames depending on the nature of the underlying claims. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5522-30. A matter \u201cis commenced\u201d when a \u201cdocument embodying the matter\u201d is filed in the appropriate office. See id. \u00a7 5503. Moreover, the Rules of Civil Procedure promulgated by this Court pursuant to Article V, Section 10(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution provide that \u201c[a]n action may be commenced by filing with the prothonotary (1) a praecipe for a writ of summons, or (2) a complaint.\u201d See Pa.R.C.P. 1007.\nIt is self-evident that once the action has been commenced, the defendant must be provided notice of the action in order for the purpose of the statutes of limitation to be fulfilled. Therefore, this Court has set forth rules governing service of original process to ensure such notice. See Pa.R.C.P. 400-430. Rules 400 and 400.1 designate who may make service, and Rule 402 provides for the manner of service. As previously noted, the combination of Rule 400.1 and Rule 402 required Appellant in the instant matter to enlist the aid of either a sheriff or a competent adult to hand-deliver the original process to the City.\nRule 401 limits the time between filing and service. Specifically, subsection (a) requires service of original process within thirty days of the issuance of the writ. If a plaintiff fails to comply with subsection (a), the claim remains valid so long as the plaintiff complies with the procedures of subsection (b), which allows for reissuance of the writ at \u201cany time and any number of times.\u201d Pa.R.C.P. 401(b). Thus, the plain language of the rule allows a plaintiff to commence an action, thereby satisfying the statute of limitations, and yet to delay the provision of notice of the claim to the defendant interminably, thus undermining the purpose of the statute of limitations. See Lamp, 366 A.2d at 888-89.\nWe first limited a plaintiffs potential abuse of this rule in Zarlinsky v. Laudenslager, 402 Pa. 290, 167 A.2d 317 (1961), by instituting the \u201cequivalent period doctrine:\u201d\n[Rule 1010(b) (repealed) ] is inadequately worded and its language must be construed by reasonable interpretation. The same limitation is to be applied to the time in which a writ of summons may be reissued as was formerly applied for the issuance of an alias or pluries writ, i.e., a writ of summons may be reissued only for a period of time which, measured from the date of original issuance of the writ, or the date of a subsequent reissuance thereof, is not longer than the period of time required by the applicable statute of limitations for the bringing of the action.\nId. at 320 (emphasis in original). We attempted to rectify this anomaly further through our holding in Lamp, where we acknowledged \u201ctoo much potential for abuse in a rule which permits a plaintiff to keep an action alive without proper notice to a defendant merely by filing a praecipe for a writ of summons and then having the writ reissued in a timely fashion without attempting to effectuate service.\u201d Lamp, 366 A.2d at 888. Pursuant to our supervisory power over Pennsylvania courts, we qualified the rule, holding prospectively that \u201ca writ of summons shall remain effective to commence an action only if the plaintiff then refrains from a course of conduct which serves to stall in its tracks the legal machinery he has just set in motion.\u201d In so construing the rule, we sought to \u201cavoid the situation in which a plaintiff can bring an action, but, by not making a good-faith effort to notify a defendant, retain exclusive control over it for a period in excess of that permitted by the statute of limitations.\u201d Id. at 889.\nWe subtly altered our holding in Lamp in Farinacci, requiring plaintiffs to demonstrate \u201ca good-faith effort to effectuate notice of commencement of the action.\u201d In announcing this refinement to the Lamp rule, we acknowledged that the good faith requirement is \u201cnot apparent from a reading of the rule itself,\u201d but rather, satisfied the stated purpose of our decision in Lamp which was to avoid the situation where a plaintiff can retain exclusive control over litigation by not making a good faith effort to notify the defendant. Farinacci, 511 A.2d at 759. We held that determining whether a plaintiff acted in good faith lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. Therefore, noting that \u201cplaintiffs are required to comply with local practice to ensure, insofar as they are able, prompt service of process,\u201d we affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss the complaint where the plaintiff failed to deliver the writ to the sheriff as required by local practice and consequently delayed service upon the defendant for over a month. Id.\nThis Court\u2019s most recent decision on the issue is the plurality decision in Witherspoon v. City of Philadelphia, 564 Pa. 388, 768 A.2d 1079 (2001). Five justices affirmed the dismissal of a complaint finding that the plaintiff did not act in good faith where he made only one unsuccessful attempt to serve the defendant in nine months. Id. (Zappala, J., Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court, joined by Flaherty, C.J.); id. at 1084 (Saylor, J., concurring, joined by Castille and Nigro, J.J.).\nWhile a majority of the court agreed that the plaintiff in that case failed to demonstrate good faith, the justices failed to agree on an appropriate test. Justice Zappala, joined by then Chief Justice Flaherty, opined that the general intent of the rules of civil procedure allowing for reissuance of writs was to\nallow a plaintiff to commence an action by filing a praecipe even at the very last moment before the limitation period expires and not be penalized because the \u2018official\u2019 follow-up activity (issuance of the writ by the prothonotary, service of the writ by the sheriff) is not also completed within the limitation period.\nId. at 1083. They contended, however, that Lamp and Farinacci restricted the scope of the rules and concluded \u201cthat any failure regarding follow-up activity that is attributable to plaintiff or his agents, rather than public officials falls outside this purpose.\u201d Id. Accordingly, they would have limited Rule 401 further: \u201c[w]e deem it necessary that where the progression \u2018straddles the line\u2019 of the limitations period the process must be served within the time allowed by the Rules of Civil Procedure or if service cannot be made, the process must be immediately and continually reissued until service is made.\u201d Id. at 1084.\nThe three concurring justices found the rule proposed by Justice Zappala \u201cunduly restrictive.\u201d Id. at 1084 (Saylor, J., concurring). Moreover, they noted that the failure to prosecute claims diligently would be better regulated by the promulgation of rules of civil procedure rather than by \u201cmodifying the tolling effect of the commencement of the action in relation to the applicable limitations periods,\u201d noting that statutes of limitations are generally tied to the commencement of an action rather than the service of process. Id. Justice Newman, in a dissent joined by now Chief Justice Cappy, similarly rejected Justice Zapalla\u2019s suggested rule which would abolish the \u201cequivalent period doctrine\u201d and instead require process to be \u201cimmediately and continually reissued.\u201d Id. at 1085. Justice Newman opined, \u201cThis elimination of the \u2018equivalent period\u2019 doctrine ignores the statutory definition of when an action commences, provides insufficient guidance for courts and practitioners in determining whether the \u2018good faith\u2019 standard has been satisfied, and disregards the other protections available to defendants where a plaintiff has been dilatory in effecting service.\u201d Id. at 1085.\nIn applying Lamp and its progeny, the Commonwealth and Superior Courts have formulated inconsistent rules, sometimes dismissing cases due to plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply strictly with the Rules of Civil Procedure and on other occasions reserving the drastic measure of dismissal for only those cases where the defendant has been prejudiced by plaintiffs failure to comply with the rules. Compare Teamann, 811 A.2d 52 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002) (equating \u201cgood faith\u201d with strict compliance with the Rules of Civil Procedure); Green, 635 A.2d 1070, 1073 (Pa.Super.1993) (same); Williams, 585 A.2d 583 (Pa.Cmwlth.1991) (same); Feher, 515 A.2d 317, 319 (Pa.Super.1986) (same); with Fulco, 686 A.2d 1330 (refusing to dismiss claims based on failure to comply with rules where defendant \"received actual notice and was not prejudiced); Leidich, 575 A.2d 914 (Pa.Super.1990) (same); Hoeke, 386 A.2d 71 (Pa.Super.1978) (same); Big Beaver Falls Area Sch. Dist. v. Big Beaver Falls Area Educ. Assoc., 89 Pa.Cmwlth. 176, 492 A.2d 87 (1985) (same); but see Schriver, 638 A.2d at 226 (holding that Lamp requires compliance but allowing exceptions as in Leidich).\nUpon review of these cases, we conclude that the rigid compliance requirement of the Teamann line of cases is incompatible with the plain language of Rule 401, the spirit of Lamp, and the admonition of Rule 126 to construe liberally the rules of procedure so long as the deviation does not affect the substantial rights of the parties. In Lamp, we sought to alleviate the hardships caused by plaintiffs who exploited the rules of civil procedure to make an end run around the statutes of limitations.\nNeither our cases nor our rules contemplate punishing a plaintiff for technical missteps where he has satisfied the purpose of the statute of limitations by supplying a defendant with actual notice. Therefore, we embrace the logic of the Leidich line of cases, which, applying Lamp, would dismiss only those claims where plaintiffs have demonstrated an intent to stall the judicial machinery or where plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure has prejudiced defendant.\nIn setting forth this rule, we are merely re-animating the purpose of Lamp and reigning in the line of cases which have strayed from it. As stated earlier, this Court in Lamp attempted to prevent plaintiffs from abusing the liberal rules of civil procedure which had been enacted originally to protect plaintiffs from being thrown out of court despite commencing an action within the applicable limitations period. The cases requiring strict compliance hearken back to these draconian procedures and replace a factual good faith inquiry with an objective bright line standard of compliance that is wholly inconsistent with the concept of good faith.\nTurning to the disposition of the case at bar, we note that Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court\u2019s finding of a good faith effort based on Appellant\u2019s failure to comply with the Rules of Civil Procedure in serving Writ 1. We now reverse the Commonwealth Court because Appellant supplied the City with actual notice. As the trial court did not speak to the issue of prejudice, we direct the Commonwealth Court to remand the case to the trial court to determine whether the .City suffered prejudice as a result of the delay of proper service between August 2002 and November 2002. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justices CASTILLE and SAYLOR join the opinion.\nJustice NEWMAN files a dissenting opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a dissenting opinion in which Justice NIGRO joins.\n. We observe that in every case applying Lamp, including the case sub judice, the plaintiff eventually complied with the Rules of Civil Procedure and formally served the defendant with process. Indeed, without this eventual service jurisdiction could never attach, and any particular case would never be litigated through the courts. See Sharp v. Valley Forge Med. Center & Heart Hosp., Inc., 422 Pa. 124, 221 A.2d 185, 187 (1966) (\"The rules relating to service of process must be strictly followed, and jurisdiction of the court over the person of the defendant is dependent upon proper service having been made\u201d). The question in these cases is whether a plaintiff\u2019s claim will be dismissed because the plaintiff's initial attempts at service do not technically comply with the rules. We do not address the situation where a plaintiff never complies with the Rules of Civil Procedure relating to service.\n. Pa.R.C.P. 1007 provides, \"An action may be commenced by filing with the prothonolary (1) a praecipe for a writ of summons, or (2) a complaint.\u201d\n. See. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5524(2).\n. Rule 401. Time for Service. Reissuance, Reinstatement and Substitution of Original Process. Copies for Service\n(a) Original process shall be served within the Commonwealth within thirty days after the issuance of the writ or the filing of the complaint.\n(b) (1) If service within the Commonwealth is not made within the time prescribed by subdivision (a) of this rule ..., the prothonotary upon praecipe and upon presentation of the original process, shall continue its validity by reissuing the writ or reinstating the complaint, by writing thereon \"reissued\u201d in the case of a writ or \"reinstated\u201d in the case of a complaint.\n(2) A writ may be reissued or a complaint reinstated at any time and any number of times. A new party defendant may be named in a reissued writ or a reinstated complaint.\n(3) A substituted writ may be issued or a substituted complaint filed upon praecipe stating that the former writ or complaint has been lost or destroyed.\n(4) A reissued, reinstated or substituted writ or complaint shall be served within the applicable time prescribed by subdivision (a) of this rule ... after reissuance, reinstatement or substitution.\n(5) If an action is commenced by writ of summons and a complaint is thereafter filed, the plaintiff instead of reissuing the writ may treat the complaint as alternative original process and as the equivalent for all purposes of a reissued writ, reissued as of the date of the filing of the complaint. Thereafter the writ may be reissued, or the complaint may be reinstated as the equivalent of a reissuance of the writ, and the plaintiff may use either the reissued writ or the reinstated complaint as alternative original process.\nNote: If the applicable time has passed after the issuance of the writ or the filing of the complaint, the writ must be reissued or the complaint reinstated to be effective as process. Filing or reinstatement or substitution of a complaint which is used as alternative process under this subdivision, has been held effective in tolling the statute of limitations as the reissuance or substitution of a writ.\nPa.R.C.P. 401.\n. Rule 400.1. Provisions for all Courts of the First Judicial District\n(a) In an action commenced in the First Judicial District, original process may be served\n(1) within the county by the sheriff or a competent adult Pa.R.C.P. 400.1(a). The First Judicial District is comprised of Philadelphia County. See Pa.R.C.P. 400.1(a) (note). Moreover, the Rules define a competent adult as \"an individual eighteen years of age or older who is neither a party to the action nor an employee or relative of a party.\u201d Pa.R.C.P. 76.\n. Pa.R.A.P. 402(a)(2)(iii) provides, \u201cOriginal service may be served ... by handing a copy ... at any office or usual place of business of the defendant to his agent or to the person for the time being in charge thereof.\u201d Similarly, Pa.R.C.P. 422(b)(1), in relevant part, requires, \"Service of original process upon a political subdivision shall be made by handing a copy to ... an agent duly authorized by the political subdivision to receive service of process.\u201d\n. The City also objected to a paragraph of Appellant\u2019s complaint as an overly broad assertion of negligence. The trial court sustained this preliminary objection. Appellant conceded this point in his reply to preliminary objections and does not contest it on appeal.\n. Nevertheless, on March 5, 2003, the trial court entered an order formally denying the petition.\n. In addition to stating that the delivery by certified mail constituted a good faith effort, the trial court also concomitantly concluded that the delivery by certified mail satisfied the requirements for service by hand delivery by a competent adult, pursuant to Pa.RX.P. 400.1 and 402. The holding that certified mail delivery satisfied the requirement of hand delivery was rejected by the Commonwealth Court. This Court declined to address this issue and instead limited our review to the Commonwealth Court's second holding regarding whether the defective service by certified mail constituted a good faith effort to effectuate notice under Lamp and its progeny.\n. The courts below and the parties discuss the good faith issue as one involving the tolling of the statute of limitations. We note, however, that the question presented concerns whether the case should be dismissed pursuant to our rule in Lamp which precludes a plaintiff from taking advantage of the continued validity of the writ following reissuance under Rule 401(b) and thereby requires dismissal of the case unless a plaintiff can begin anew within the original period of limitations. As aptly stated by Justice Newman;\nStrictly speaking, however, th[e] ability to dismiss the action has not been based on the bar of the statute of limitation, but has been based on the failure to satisfy the Lamp rule. Cf. [Zarlinsky v. Laudenslager, 402 Pa. 290, 167 A.2d 317, 319 (1961)] (\"The [statute of limitations] is without direct bearing on the issue here involved since the plaintiffs filed their praecipe for writ of summons ... within two years of the happening of the accident. The statutory period of limitation becomes important, however, by analogy and furnishes the basis for the rule promulgated by the decision of this court with respect to the period of time within which a plaintiff must act to protect the efficiency of a writ of summons issued but not served.\u201d).\nWitherspoon, 768 A.2d at 1088 (Newman, J., dissenting, joined by Cappy, J.) (emphasis in original); see also id. at 1084 (Saylor, J. concurring, joined by Castille and Nigro, JJ.).\n. Appellant additionally notes that, upon receipt of Writ 1, the City could have sought an order to compel Appellant to file a complaint pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1037.\n. See Leidich, 575 A.2d 914 (affirming decision not to dismiss where defendant was not prejudiced by the improper service by mail and plaintiff did not engage in course of conduct to stall machinery of justice, but rather pursued discovery prior to providing proper service); Schriver v. Mazziotti, 432 Pa.Super. 276, 638 A.2d 224 (1994) (concluding that plaintiff failed to make a good faith effort by neglecting to provide any notice to defendant, but distinguishing Leidich and Hoeke v. Mercy Hospital, 254 Pa.Super. 520, 386 A.2d 71 (1978) (plurality opinion) where the plaintiff acted in good faith by supplying actual, albeit technically deficient, notice which did not prejudice the defendant's substantive rights and where plaintiff did not intend to stall machinery of justice); Fulco v. Shaffer, 455 Pa.Super. 30, 686 A.2d 1330 (1996) (distinguishing cases such as Leidich, Hoeke, and Fulco where defendants received actual, though defective, notice from other cases where the defendants do not receive notice, noting that the defendants in the former cases do not suffer unfair surprise regarding the litigation after the running of the statute of limitations).\n. We note, however, that the cited cases do not hold specifically that the failure to comply with the rules is tantamount to a lack of good faith.\n. See Schriver, 638 A.2d at 226 (At a minimum, the good faith effort required in [Lamp] mandates compliance with the Pennsylvania Rules of [Civil] Procedure, and importantly, local practice)\u201d (quoting Feher v. Altman, 357 Pa.Super. 50, 515 A.2d 317, 319 (1986) and Green v. Vinglas, 431 Pa.Super. 58, 635 A.2d 1070, 1073 (1993)); Teamann, 811 A.2d 52 (same). As noted supra in note 12, however, the court in Schriver, specifically distinguished the Leidich line of cases where petitioners acted in good faith despite a failure to conform to the rules regarding service:\nBoth Leidich and Hoeke indicate that when the plaintiff attempts to give notice to the defendant, and does so, albeit in a technically defective fashion, and the plaintiff has not engaged in conduct to forestall \u2018the machinery of justiceL\u2019] our [courts] will find that the statute of limitations has been tolled and allow the action to proceed.\nSchriver, 638 A.2d at 227.\n. We note that the question of whether strict compliance with the rules of civil procedure is required to meet the good faith test is a pure question of law, over which our review is plenary. See Bilt-Rite Contractors, Inc. v. The Architectural Studio, 581 Pa. 454, 866 A.2d 270, 274 (2005).\n. In Zarlinsky, this Court reviewed former Rule 1010(b), which provided that a writ may be reissued \u201cat any time and any number of times.\u201d The present Rule 401(b) includes the identical language.\n. In Farinacci, the majority affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff violated Lamp when plaintiff's counsel misplaced the file and later forgot to take the necessary steps to effectuate timely service. Three justices dissented, focusing on Lamp's \"intention to permit a party to demonstrate that his actions have not unreasonably stalled the legal proceedings he initiated.\u201d Farinacci, 511 A.2d at 760 (Zapalla, J., dissenting, joined by Larsen and McDermott, JJ.). The dissent argued that Lamp required a plaintiff to act reasonably. The dissent concluded that the plaintiff had not intended to stall the legal processes, and that defendant was not prejudiced by the delay in proper service because the defendant had been aware of plaintiff's claim for over a year prior to the commencement of legal proceedings. While the majority did not respond to the dissent's argument, we note that while the defendant in Farinacci had notice of the potential for litigation, it did not have actual notice of the commencement of litigation within the statute of limitations period. This contrasts with the cases such as Leidich and the instant case where the defendants had actual notice of the commencement of litigation, albeit via technically deficient service.\n. Justice Saylor noted that the Federal Rules of Procedure provide for such regulation, specifically citing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m):\nTime Limit for Service. If service of the summons and complaint is not made upon a defendant within 120 days after the filing of the complaint, the court, upon motion or on its own initiative after notice to the plaintiff, shall dismiss the action without prejudice as to that defendant or direct that service be effected within a specified time; provided that if the plaintiff shows good cause for the failure, the court shall extend the time for service for an appropriate period. This subdivision does not apply to service in a foreign country pursuant to subdivision (f) or (j)(l).\n. Justice Newman recommended a remand for a hearing regarding whether the plaintiff\u2019s efforts in Witherspoon satisfied the good faith requirement of Lamp.\n. Additionally, we note that there may be situations where actual notice may not be absolutely necessary so long as prejudice did not result, but we need not delineate such an exception here because the issue is not before us."}
