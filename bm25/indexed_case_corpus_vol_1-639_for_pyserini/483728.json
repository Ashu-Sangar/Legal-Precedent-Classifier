{"id": "483728", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis case presents the question whether an acquirer of a lost security is entitled to compel the corporate issuer \u2018 to register a transfer of the security on its books. We hold that, in the circumstances of this case, she is not.\nOn December 4, 1967, appellant entered a judgment against Robert Gunning. A writ of execution issued, and in May, 1968, the sheriff levied on personal property of Robert Gunning consisting of ten certificates evidencing shares of the issuer\u2019s stock. The certificates were sold to appellant at a sheriff\u2019s sale on March 13, 1972. Prior to the sale, according to appellant\u2019s complaint, the sheriff was advised by an agent of the issuer that the seized shares were valid certificates subject to transfer.\nFollowing the sheriff\u2019s sale, appellant presented the certificates to a securities broker for the purpose of registration of the transfer. In early April, 1972, the certificates were forwarded to the transfer agent, who registered the transfer and returned shares of the issuer to the broker for the account of appellant. Several days thereafter, however, the registration of the transfer was voided as a result of the discovery of a stop order placed on these certificates. The issuer and the transfer agent refuse to register appellant as a shareholder of the issuer.\nThe stop order resulted from the loss of these certificates by Robert Gunning. In June, 1960, he executed an affidavit in which he stated that he had lost the certificates in 1956. Replacement certificates had been issued to him by the transfer agent.\nAppellant brought this action in equity to compel the issuer to register the transfer. The issuer brought in Central Penn National Bank, transfer agent at the time of the levy in 1968, as a third-party defendant. In its answer, Central Penn pleaded that in June, 1968, its counsel had by letter informed appellant that the certificates seized by the sheriff had been cancelled and replaced upon the affidavit of Robert Gunning that they had been lost; it also pleaded that in August, 1968, a former transfer agent forwarded to appellant a copy of Gunning\u2019s Lost Original Instrument Affidavit. Appellant admitted receipt of the letter and affidavit.\nAppellee moved for summary judgment on the basis of the pleadings alone. The chancellor entered a decree granting appellee\u2019s motion. This appeal followed. We affirm.\nThis controversy is governed by Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code. Replacement of lost securities by the issuer is mandated by 12A P.S. \u00a7 8-405(2) under certain conditions, which Robert Gunning apparently satisfied in this case. Appellant\u2019s right, as acquirer of the replaced securities, to compel the issuer to recognize her as a shareholder is provided in 12A P.S. \u00a7 8-405(8).\n\u201cIf, after the issue of the new security, a bona fide purchaser of the original security presents it for registration of transfer, the issuer must register the transfer . . . .\u201d\nIt is apparent that this right exists only if appellant is a \u201cbona fide purchaser,\u201d which is defined in 12A P.S. \u00a7 8-302:\n\u201cA \u2018bona fide purchaser\u2019 is a purchaser for value in good faith and without notice of any adverse claim who takes delivery of a security in bearer form or of one in registered form issued to him or indorsed to him or in blank.\u201d\nThe chancellor concluded that appellant was not a bona fide purchaser as a matter of law because she admitted in her pleading that she had in 1968 received notice that the certificates had been replaced. Appellant argues that this conclusion was erroneous because of the existence of the unresolved factual issue whether the 1968 notice had, by the time of the 1972 sheriff\u2019s sale, ceased to be effective.\nWe do not reach the question whether appellant was \u201cwithout notice of any adverse claim.\u201d On other grounds we conclude that appellant is not a bona fide purchaser and is thus not entitled to compel the issuer to register the transfer of the lost certificates under 12A P.S. \u00a78-405(3).\nFor one to be a bona fide purchaser under 12A P.S. \u00a7 8-302, he must first of all be a \u201cpurchaser.\u201d \u201cPurchaser\u201d is defined in 12A P.S. \u00a7 1-201(32) & (33) as \u201ca person who takes\u201d by \u201csale, discount, negotiation, mortgage, pledge, lien, issue or re-issue, gift or any other voluntary transaction creating an interest in property.\u201d We read \u201cany other voluntary transaction\u201d as not only adding a catch-all provision but also modifying the specifically enumerated transactions. While the transfer of the certificates from Robert Gunning to appellant may have been a \u201csale,\u201d it surely was not a voluntary sale. The intervention of legal process for the benefit of a judgment creditor indicates that, as to Robert Gunning, this transaction was involuntary. The transaction by which appellant as creditor acquired the certificates was therefore not a \u201cpurchase\u201d and she was not a \u201cpurchaser.\u201d Accord, National Shawmut Bank of Boston v. Vera, 352 Mass. 11, 14, 223 N.E.2d 515, 517 (1967); see generally 1 R. Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code \u00a7\u00a7 1-201:98to: 102 (1970).\nIn addition, achievement of \u201cbona fide purchaser\u201d status under 12A P.S. \u00a7 8-302 requires that the purchaser \u201ctake delivery of a security .\u201d \u201c \u2018Delivery\u2019 with respect to . securities means voluntary transfer of possession.\u201d 12A P.S. \u00a7 1-201(14) (emphasis supplied). It is beyond cavil that the transfer of the certificates from Robert Gunning to appellant effected on her behalf by the sheriff was not a \u201cvoluntary transfer of possession.\u201d\nThis reading of the Code makes good commercial sense. The preferred status that the Legislature conferred on bona fide purchasers is designed to protect the free market in the instruments of finance. Greater social benefit accrues if investors make decisions on the basis of the investment merits unhindered by fears of possible adverse claims or illiquidity resulting from potential transferees\u2019 fears of adverse claims. Investment yields greater social benefits when investors place their funds according to their assessment of investment risks and rewards and undeterred by unassessable legal risks.\nHowever, protection from adverse claims performs this salutary function only with respect to the regular and ordinary operation of the market for financial instruments. Appellant, however, was operating outside the regular course of trade in her attempt to extract assets of value from her judgment debtor.\nOur conclusion that appellant is not a \u201cpurchaser\u201d who took \u201cdelivery\u201d is supported by the treatment accorded a bona fide purchaser\u2019s fraternal twin, Article 3\u2019s \u201cholder in due course.\u201d It is specifically provided that a holder of commercial paper who takes under circumstances comparable to appellant\u2019s acquisition in this case is denied the preferred status of holder in due course:\n\u201cA holder does not become a holder in due course of an instrument:\n(a) by purchase of it at judicial sale or by taking it under legal process; . . . .\u201d\n12A P.S. \u00a7 3-302(3). Since the favored positions of bona fide purchasers of securities and holders in due course of commercial paper are supported by similar grounds of policy, the statutory language which defines the circumstances under which acquirers of instruments and securities receive their preferred status ought to be similarly construed.\nWe hold that, under the Uniform Commercial Code, appellant is not a \u201cbona fide purchaser\u201d because, as a matter of law, she is not a \u201cpurchaser\u201d and did not take by \u201cdelivery.\u201d Therefore, she is not entitled to registration of transfer under 12A P.S. \u00a7 8-405(3). Accordingly, \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d and appellee \u201cis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Pa.R.Civ.R. 1035(b), 12 P.S. Appendix. The chancellor was correct in granting appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\nDecree affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. The pleadings present an extremely complex factual situation. In this opinion we will discuss only those pleaded facts which are relevant to the decision.\nIdentification of the parties is also a complex matter. The ' \u201creal\u201d plaintiff is Julia Gunning. Suit was brought to her use by her attorney, Lawrence Mazer. We will refer to them jointly as \u201cappellant.\u201d Appellee is the issuer of the securities that are the subject of this action. In 1968, the issuer was the Edgecomb Steel Corporation. At some time before 1972, all of Edgecomb\u2019s outstanding stock was acquired by The Williams Companies (mis-styled by appellant the \u201cWilliams Brothers Company\u201d). Under appropriate circumstances, shares of Edgecomb stock may be exchanged for shares of Williams stock. We will refer to Edge-comb and Williams jointly as \u201cissuer.\u201d At different times relevant to this action, the issuer has employed three different transfer agents, the Fidelity Bank of Philadelphia, Central Penn National Bank of Philadelphia, and the First National City Bank of New York. We will refer to them jointly as \u201cthe transfer agent.\u201d\n. Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art.
