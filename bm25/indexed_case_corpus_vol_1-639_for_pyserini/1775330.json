{"id": "1775330", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThese are consolidated appeals from the Final Legislative Reapportionment Plan, which was filed by the Pennsylvania Legislative Reapportionment Commission on October 13, 1981. For the reasons set forth, we hold that the reapportionment plan complies with all of the requirements of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of this Commonwealth.\nThe plan challenged on these appeals is the second reapportionment plan to be adopted by the Legislative Reapportionment Commission, which, since 1968, has been constitutionally vested with the obligation to reapportion the legislative districts of the Commonwealth \u201c[i]n each year following that in which the Federal decennial census is officially reported.\u201d Pa.Const. art. II, \u00a7 17(a). Pursuant to the Constitution, the Commission consists of five members who act by majority vote: the majority and minority leaders of both the Senate and House of Representatives (or deputies appointed by each of them), and a chairman who is selected either by the other four members of the Commission or, if the four Commission members are unable to do so within the time prescribed, by this Court. Pa.Const. art. II, \u00a7 17(b). The present Legislative Reapportionment Commission, which consists of the majority and minority members of each house and a chairman selected by them, unanimously adopted the Final Legislative Reapportionment Plan now before this Court for review.\nAppellants appeal pursuant to Pa.Const. art. II, \u00a7 17(d), which provides that \u201cany aggrieved person may file an appeal from the final plan directly to the Supreme Court within thirty days after the filing thereof.\u201d Pursuant to that same constitutional provision, appellants have the burden of establishing \u201cthat the final plan is contrary to law.\u201d See Commonwealth ex rel. Specter v. Levin, 448 Pa. 1, 19, 293 A.2d 15, 24 (1972), appeal dism\u2019d for want of substantial federal question, 409 U.S. 810, 93 S.Ct. 44, 34 L.Ed.2d 65 (1972).\nI\nThe law which governs these appeals and circumscribes this Court\u2019s review of the Commission\u2019s Final Legislative Reapportionment Plan is set forth in Article II, Section 16 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. In interpreting the Equal Protection Clause, the Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly recognized that reapportionment \u201cis primarily a matter for legislative consideration and determination.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 586, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1394, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964). Accord, e.g., Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. 735, 93 S.Ct. 2321, 37 L.Ed.2d 298 (1973); Mahan v. Howell, 410 U.S. 315, 93 S.Ct. 979, 35 L.Ed.2d 320 (1973); Ely v. Klahr, 403 U.S. 108, 91 S.Ct. 1803, 29 L.Ed.2d 352 (1971); Burns v. Richardson, 384 U.S. 73, 86 S.Ct. 1286, 16 L.Ed.2d 376 (1966). In addressing the limited, constitutional nature of judicial review of reapportionment matters, the Supreme Court of the United States has rejected a litigant\u2019s claim that a state reapportionment plan should be invalidated merely because the alternative plan proposed by the litigant is a \u201cbetter\u201d one:\n\u201cAnd what is to happen to the Master\u2019s plan if a resourceful mind hits upon a plan better than the Master\u2019s by a fraction of a percentage point? Involvement like this must end at some point, but that point constantly recedes if those who litigate need only produce a plan that is marginally \u2018better\u2019 when measured against a rigid and unyielding population-equality standard.\nThe point is, that such involvements should never begin. We have repeatedly recognized that state reapportionment is the task of local legislatures or of those organs of state government selected to perform it.\u201d\nGaffney v. Cummings, supra, 412 U.S. at 750-51, 93 S.Ct. at 2330. Thus, to prevail in their challenge to the final reapportionment plan, appellants have the burden of establishing not, as some of the appellants have argued, that there exists an alternative plan which is \u201cpreferable\u201d or \u201cbetter,\u201d but rather that the final plan filed by the Pennsylvania Reapportionment Commission fails to meet constitutional requirements.\nThe principle that reapportionment is a legislative function is evident from the plain language of this state\u2019s Constitution. Article II, Section 17(d) directs not only that the Legislative Reapportionment Commission file a reapportionment plan but also that, in the event a final plan is determined by this Court to be invalid, the plan be remanded to the Commission for a second attempt at reapportionment. As this Court stated in Commonwealth ex rel. Specter v. Levin, 448 Pa. 1, 7, 293 A.2d 15, 17-18 (1972), the constitutional delegation of responsibility for reapportionment to the Legislative Reapportionment Commission is designed to retain \u201cthe Legislature\u2019s expertise in reapportionment matters.\u201d\nII\nThe constitutional requirements which govern this Court\u2019s review are set forth in detail in Commonwealth ex rel. Specter v. Levin, 448 Pa. 1, 293 A.2d 15 (1972), where this Court reviewed, and sustained as constitutional, the 1971 reapportionment plan, the first to be effectuated under Article II, Section 16 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In Specter, this Court made clear that the federal constitutional requirement of equal protection, which mandates \u201c \u2018that a State make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts, in both houses of its Legislature, as nearly of equal population as is practicable,\u2019 \u201d is incorporated as a matter of state constitutional law in Article II, Section 16, which provides that districts be \u201ccomposed of compact and contiguous territory as nearly equal in population as practicable.... \u201d In Specter, this Court also made clear that, as a matter of both federal and state law, equality of population must be the controlling consideration in the apportionment of legislative seats. As the Supreme Court of the United States has stated,\n\u201cthe basic principle of representative government remains, and must remain, unchanged \u2014 the weight of a citizen\u2019s vote cannot be made to depend on where he lives. Population is, of necessity, the starting point for consideration and the controlling criterion for judgment in legislative apportionment controversies.\u201d\nReynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. at 567, 84 S.Ct. at 1384 (footnote omitted).\nThe Final Legislative Reapportionment Plan reflects the Legislative Reapportionment Commission\u2019s adherence to the goal of equal population among legislative districts. When the population of the Commonwealth is divided by the 50 seats constitutionally mandated for the Senate and the 203 seats constitutionally mandated for the House of Representatives, the ideal district of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d is composed of 237,334 people for the Senate and 58,456 people for the House. Under the final plan of the Legislative Reapportionment Commission, the range of deviation between the highest and lowest populated districts is only 1.9% from the ideal Senate district and 2.8% from the ideal House district. There is no doubt that this plan, which more nearly achieves the goal of equal population than did the 1971 reapportionment plan in Specter, satisfies equal protection requirements. \u25a0 Indeed, as is demonstrated by the table contained in the accompanying footnote, the final plan achieves an equality of population among legislative districts closer to the constitutional ideal of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d than any previous reapportionment plan in the history of the Commonwealth.\nIll\nAppellants contend that the Final Legislative Reapportionment Plan goes too far toward achieving the constitutional goal of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d and, in so doing, fails to achieve the additional state constitutional goals of Article II, Section 16, that districts be compact, and that no political subdivision be divided unnecessarily. Article II, Section 16 provides in full:\n\u201cLegislative districts\nThe Commonwealth shall be divided into fifty senatorial and two hundred three representative districts, which shall be composed of compact and contiguous territory as nearly equal in population as practicable. Each senatorial district shall elect one Senator, and each representative district one Representative. Unless absolutely necessary no county, city, incorporated town, borough, township or ward shall be divided in forming either a senatorial or representative district.\u201d\nA.\nAppellants\u2019 argument is based on the premise that the goals of compactness and maintenance of political subdivisions are as important as the goal of maximum population equality among districts. Thus, appellants argue, district deviations from compactness and subdivision boundaries are constitutionally permissible only if these deviations are absolutely necessary to survive federal equal protection analysis.\nContrary to appellants\u2019 premise, this Court has held that the state constitutional mandate that districts be \u201cas nearly of equal population as is practicable\u201d requires that \u201cthe object of any reapportionment plan must be substantial equality of population\u201d and that, if need be, the concerns for compactness and adherence to political subdivision lines must yield to this \u201coverriding objective.\u201d 448 Pa. at 13, 293 A.2d at 21. In Specter, where the Court was first called upon to interpret Article II, Section 16 of the Constitution, we looked not only to federal constitutional principles but also to the language of the Pennsylvania Constitution. This Court recognized that, with a fixed number of legislative seats to be apportioned \u201cas nearly equal in population as practicable\u201d and a \u201cpopulation density of this state [that] is quite uneven,\u201d in any apportionment scheme there is a \u201ccertain degree of unavoidable noncompactness\u201d and a \u201ccertain amount of subdivision fragmentation [that] is inevitable.\u201d Specter, 448 Pa. at 17-18, 293 A.2d at 23.\nB.\nAppellants rely upon decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States rendered since Specter that have upheld state reapportionment plans with greater district deviations from the ideal population than in Specter or in this case. See, e.g., White v. Regester, 412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973); Mahan v. Howell, 410 U.S. 315, 93 S.Ct. 979, 35 L.Ed.2d 320 (1973). Appellants argue that, because a greater deviation from the population ideal than exists in the final plan would constitute \u201csubstantial equality of population\u201d under federal equal protection standards, that greater deviation must define Pennsylvania\u2019s standard for substantial equality of population. According to appellants, it is constitutionally impermissible to create districts that more closely approach the ideal of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d if to do so would also render districts more noncompact and divide more political subdivisions.\nAppellants\u2019 argument disregards the critical fact that adherence to a percentage deviation that is at the outside limits of constitutionality cannot be squared with the overriding constitutional objective of \u201csubstantial equality of population\u201d among districts. The Pennsylvania Constitution plainly states that districts shall be \u201cas nearly equal in population as practicable.\u201d Thus, the clear constitutional directive is that reapportionment shall strive to create districts as equal, not as unequal, as possible. As this Court has stated,\n\u201c \u2018if, even as a result of a clearly rational state policy of according some legislative representation to political subdivisions, population is submerged as the controlling consideration in the apportionment of seats in the particular legislative body, then the right of all the State\u2019s citizens to cast an effective and adequately weighted vote would be unconstitutionally impaired.\u2019 \u201d\nSpecter, 448 Pa. at 9, 293 A.2d at 19, quoting Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. at 581, 84 S.Ct. at 1391.\nMoreover, there is no predetermined percentage deviation from the ideal of \u201cone person, one vote\u201d that satisfies the federal constitutional requirement of \u201csubstantial equality of population.\u201d As the Supreme Court of the United States has stated, \u201c[w]hat is marginally permissible in one State may be unsatisfactory in another, depending on the particular circumstances of the case.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. at 578, 84 S.Ct. at 1390. Accord, Mahan v. Howell, 410 U.S. 315, 328-29, 93 S.Ct. 979, 987, 35 L.Ed.2d 320 (1973) (\u201ccitations to numerous cases decided by state and lower federal courts [are] of limited use in determining the constitutionality of Virginia\u2019s statute\u201d); Swann v. Adams, 385 U.S. 440, 446, 87 S.Ct. 569, 573, 17 L.Ed.2d 501 (1967) (\u201cfact that a 10% or 15% variation from the norm is approved in one State has little bearing on the validity of a similar variation in another State\u201d).\nNor can appellants prevail on the theory that this Court should review the final plan of the Legislative Reapportionment Commission to determine whether there is a standard of population deviation greater than that adopted by the Commission, but less than the maximum deviation permissible under the federal Constitution, which would more closely achieve the goals of compactness and undivided political subdivisions. As the Court of Appeals of New York recognized in dismissing a similar claim, the role of the Court in reviewing a reapportionment plan is not to substitute a more \u201cpreferable\u201d plan for that of the Commission, but only to assure that constitutional requirements have been met. See Schneider v. Rockefeller, 31 N.Y.2d 420, 340 N.Y.S.2d 889, 293 N.E.2d 67 (1972).\nThe invalidity of appellants\u2019 premise that there is a predetermined percentage deviation with which any reapportionment plan must comply is evident from the disruptive effect such a theory would have on the respective roles of the Legislature and the Court in reapportionment. Under appellants\u2019 approach, the Court \u2014 rather than the legislative branch as represented by the Legislative Reapportionment Commission \u2014 would have the ultimate responsibility of deciding the precise mathematical formula to be applied in dividing the population of the state among legislative districts. This usurpation of the legislative function would not only be inappropriate but also might well interfere with the Commission\u2019s ability to achieve the goals of compactness and preservation of subdivision lines with which appellants are concerned.\nIV\nIt is well settled that, \u201cin determining whether a good faith effort to establish districts substantially equal in population has been made, a court must necessarily consider a State\u2019s legislative apportionment scheme as a whole.\u201d Lucas v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly of Colorado, 377 U.S. 713, 735 n.27, 84 S.Ct. 1459, 1473 n.27, 12 L.Ed.2d 632 (1964). We conclude that the Final Legislative Reapportionment Plan reflects a constitutionally permissible judgment on the part of the Commission that the deviations from mathematical compactness and political subdivision boundaries contained in the plan are necessary to achieve the overriding constitutional goal of districts \u201cas equal in population as practicable.\u201d\nWith a constitutional mandate- that there shall be 50 Senate districts and 203 House districts it is inevitable that some of the State\u2019s 67 counties and 2,569 municipalities, with their widely divergent populations, must be divided among legislative districts. Yet, even with this large number of disparately populated political subdivisions and the closest adherence in the history of the Commonwealth to the ideal of \u201cone person, one vote,\u201d the Commission\u2019s Senate Plan has preserved the boundaries of 41 counties and all but two municipalities. So too, with the ideal population of a House district set at 58,456, a figure far exceeded by the populations of numerous counties and municipalities, the House Plan has nonetheless preserved the boundaries of 19 counties and all but 87 municipalities. None of the arguments presented by appellants convinces us that the drawing of district lines, which necessarily involves value judgments by the Commission, has been based upon impermissible considerations. Mere dissatisfaction with the fact that certain political subdivisions have been divided or have been included within particular legislative districts is not sufficient to invalidate the Final Reapportionment Plan as unconstitutional. Moreover, the Supreme Court of the United States has made clear that \u201cneither history alone, nor economic or other sorts of group interests, are permissible factors in attempting to justify disparities from population-based representation.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. at 579-80, 84 S.Ct. at 1391 (1964).\nAllegations that districts have been the subject of gerrymandering to dilute the voting strength of minorities are not supported. A reapportionment plan may be invalid because it fences out a racial or ethnic group \u201cso as to deprive them of their pre-existing municipal vote,\u201d Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 341, 81 S.Ct. 125, 127, 5 L.Ed.2d 110 (1960), or because it operates \u201cto minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population,\u201d Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U.S. 433, 439, 85 S.Ct. 498, 501, 13 L.Ed.2d 401 (1965). See Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.S. at 751, 93 S.Ct. at 2330. To sustain a constitutional claim that district lines have been racially or ethnically gerrymandered, it is essential to prove a discriminatory purpose. It must be proved that the challenged plan was \u201cconceived or operated as [a] purposeful [device] to further racial discrimination.\u201d Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124, 149, 91 S.Ct. 1858, 1872 (1971). Such proof is utterly absent here.\nV\nThus, we are satisfied that, as in 1971, this Commonwealth\u2019s Legislative Reapportionment Commission has utilized the relevant population data to fashion a legislative districting plan in full compliance with both the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this Commonwealth. Accordingly, by the mandate of Article II, Section 17(e) of the Pennsylvania Constitution, the Final Plan of the Commission, filed October 13, 1981, shall have the force of law, and shall be used in all forthcoming elections to the General Assembly until the next constitutionally mandated reapportionment shall be approved.\nPlan in compliance.\nNIX and LARSEN, JJ., file dissenting opinions.\nKAUFFMAN, J., files a dissenting opinion in which LARSEN, J., joins.\n. The Commission\u2019s first reapportionment plan, which has been in effect during the past ten years, was adopted in 1971 and upheld as constitutional by this Court in Commonwealth ex rel. Specter v. Levin, 448 Pa. 1, 293 A.2d 15, appeal dism\u2019d for want of substantial federal question, 409 U.S. 810, 93 S.Ct. 44, 34 L.Ed.2d 65 (1972).\nPrior to the 1968 amendment to the Pennsylvania Constitution, which for the first time provided for a Legislative Reapportionment Commission, the Constitution assigned the task of reapportionment to the full General Assembly. In the event that the General Assembly did not adopt a reapportionment plan within the time required, this Court had the obligation to devise an appropriate plan, an obligation which this Court assumed in 1965. See Butcher v. Bloom (Butcher II), 420 Pa. 305, 216 A.2d 457 (1966) and Butcher v. Bloom (Butcher I), 415 Pa. 438, 203 A.2d 556 (1964). Thus, this Court is well aware of the difficulties and complexities involved in the drafting of a state-wide reapportionment plan.\n. It has been asserted that the Commission failed to submit a proper record of its proceedings to this Court. We have considered the materials submitted by the Commission in light of Pa.Const. art. II, \u00a7 17(h), and are satisfied that the Commission has fulfilled its constitutional responsibility in this regard.\n. The Constitution provides that the Supreme Court shall \u201cproceed on its own motion to reapportion the Commonwealth\u201d only \u201c[i]f a preliminary, revised or final reapportionment plan is not filed by the commission within the time prescribed by this section, unless the time be extended by the Supreme Court for cause shown Pa.Const, art. II, \u00a7 17(g).\n. 448 Pa. at 7, 293 A.2d at 18, quoting Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 577, 84 S.Ct. 1362, 1390, 12 L.Ed.2d 506 (1964).\n. The total population of the Commonwealth is 11,866,728.\n. Total Percentage Deviation From Ideal District Population.\n(Ideal in parentheses)\nSenate_House\n1981 1.93 % 2.81%\n(237,334) (58,456)\n1971 4.31% 5.46%\n(235,949) (58,113)\n19.6% 30.04% 1966\n(226,387) (56,597)\n. We are satisfied that no violation of the constitutional mandate of contiguity is presented on these appeals. The one claim of non-contiguity that is raised, at No. 535, was not presented to the Commission.\n. The contention that districts have been the subject of gerrymandering to favor incumbents is similarly not substantiated. Indeed, the very structure of the Legislative Reapportionment Commission, constitutionally designed to include the leaders of both major political parties and a neutral chairman, guards against this form of favoritism."}
