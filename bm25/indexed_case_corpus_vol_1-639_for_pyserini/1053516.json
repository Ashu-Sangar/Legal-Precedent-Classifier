{"id": "1053516", "contents": "The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered,\nPer Curiam.\nWhen one goes upon a note or bond with a married woman, whether as a principal or a surety, he is the only party bound. When Mrs. Wessner\u2019s name was stricken out of the judgment, which was irregularly confessed against her, Unangst stood where he was before and at the time of the execution of the single bill, and his being a surety made no difference in' his liability. We perceive no error in striking out her name.\nJudgment affirmed."}
