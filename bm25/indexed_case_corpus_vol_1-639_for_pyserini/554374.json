{"id": "554374", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThe plaintiff declared on a \u201c promissory note or due bill.\u201d It is payable on demand. It is therefore evidence of a present debt. It is due and demandable immediately. The commencement of a suit is a sufficient demand. No demand is necessary as a condition precedent to a right of action: Andress\u2019 Appeal, 99 Penn. St. 421; Milne\u2019s Appeal, Idem 483; Smith v. Bell, 107 Idem 352. It follows that this due bill on its face was barred by the statute of limitations before suit brought. The main body of the note was in the handwriting of the maker. It was however altered in a material part, admittedly not in his handwriting, .by adding \u201c with interest at 6 per cent, until paid.\u201d No evidence explaining this alteration was given. The plaintiff executor did not become a .competent witness, as his wife was so interested as to be clearly incompetent.\nJudgment affirmed."}
