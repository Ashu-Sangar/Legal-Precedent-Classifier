{"id": "1719634", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nAppellant, Alvin Tyler, was arrested and indicted for murder, voluntary manslaughter, and involuntary manslaughter; these charges arose from the death of one, Anita Staton. Counsel was appointed by the court to represent appellant. Court appointed counsel entered an appearance on appellant\u2019s behalf and represented appellant at the preliminary hearing and at further pretrial proceedings. On July 22, 1974, immediately prior to commencement of trial, appellant requested that his court appointed counsel be dismissed and that new counsel be appointed. At that time appellant alleged an irreconcilable difference of opinion between himself and his court appointed counsel as to the manner in which the trial of his case should be conducted. Appellant\u2019s court appointed counsel acknowledged the existence of such a difference of opinion, but advised the court that he was precluded by the attorney-client privilege from further explaining the nature of the difficulties. Appellant\u2019s motion was denied by the trial court. Appellant stated to the court that he would not allow his court appointed counsel to represent him, acknowledged that he was financially unable to secure private counsel, requested the court to provide other counsel for him, and, in light of the court\u2019s refusal to appoint other counsel, advised the court that he would represent himself. The trial court then ordered the court appointed counsel to remain and be available for such consultation as \u201c[appellant] cares to make of you,\u201d and to \u201ctake such steps as appear to be necessary, proper and appropriate on [appellant\u2019s] behalf throughout this entire proceeding.\u201d\nTrial was thereafter held before the judge and a jury from July 22, 1974, through July 25, 1974. Throughout the three days of trial, appellant acted as his own attorney. At the conclusion of the trial appellant was found guilty of second degree murder. Post-verdict motions were filed and argued by the same counsel originally appointed by the court. These motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to not less than five nor more than twenty years imprisonment. This appeal, in which appellant is represented by new counsel, followed.\nAppellant raises three arguments in support of his request for a new trial. In light of our conclusion that appellant did not voluntarily, understandingly, and intelligently waive his constitutional right to counsel during the trial, we need not consider the other two arguments presented. As stated by the prosecution in its brief, any determination as to the validity of appellant\u2019s position here r\u00e9quires us to consider:\n\u201c(1) Whether the trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s request for the appointment of counsel, and (2) if such denial was justifiable, whether the trial court properly allowed appellant to proceed pro se.\u201d\nWe conclude that the answer to both questions requires that appellant be granted a new trial.\nAs to the propriety of the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s request for appointment of new counsel, it is true that we have held that an indigent is entitled to free counsel, but not entitled to free counsel of his choice. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 428 Pa. 210, 236 A.2d 805 (1968). Although the right to counsel is absolute, there is no absolute right to a particular counsel. See United States ex rel. Carey v. Rundle, 409 F.2d 1210 (3d Cir. 1969), cert. denied 397 U.S. 946, 90 S.Ct. 964, 25 L. Ed.2d 127 (1970). As we recognized in Commonwealth v. Johnson, supra, a defendant might reject court appointed counsel but he may do so only \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d Id. at 213, 236 A.2d at 807. See also Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 318, 19 P.S. Appendix.\nThe prosecution argues here that the trial court\u2019s refusal to appoint new counsel was properly based on our holdings in Commonwealth v. Segers, 460 Pa. 149, 331 A.2d 462 (1975) and Commonwealth v. Johnson, supra, 428 Pa. 210, 236 A.2d 805 (1968). Quoting from Commonwealth v. Johnson, the Segers\u2019 court specifically rejected a \u201cbroad based attack on our entire defender system\u201d as being \u201cgood cause\u201d for the granting of a defendant\u2019s petition for change of counsel. Unlike the present case, in which appellant\u2019s dissatisfaction with his court appointed attorney resulted from what appellant described as an irreconcilable difference between them as to the manner in which the trial should be conducted, Segers\u2019 dissatisfaction with his lawyer apparently stemmed primarily from his general unhappiness with court appointed attorneys. Furthermore, in Segers, the stated reason for appellant\u2019s request for change of counsel was a \u201cconflict of interest,\u201d in that his counsel had not obtained two witnesses for his defense. Segers\u2019 counsel, however, informed the court that the two witnesses in question had, in fact, been subpoenaed. In the instant case, court appointed counsel agreed with appellant that a difference of opinion did exist as to the manner in which the trial should be conducted. Moreover, there is no evidence that appellant\u2019s request for appointment of new counsel was arbitrarily made, or made for the sole purpose of delaying the trial. It is therefore clear to us that the court\u2019s refusal to appoint new counsel was an abuse of discretion, and appellant is entitled to a new trial, with new counsel, on that basis.\nAlternatively, we conclude that the trial court committed reversible error by allowing appellant to proceed with the trial under his own representation, without first conducting a thorough on-the-record colloquy to determine whether appellant knowingly and understandingly made a decision to represent himself and also to determine the validity of his waiver of the constitutional right to representation by counsel. It is, of course, firmly established that an accused has a constitutional right to counsel during trial. While an accused may waive his constitutional right, such a waiver must be the \u201cfree and unconstrained choice of its maker.\u201d Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1961), and also must be made knowingly and intelligently, Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L. Ed. 1461 (1938). To be a knowing and intelligent waiver defendant must be aware of both the right and of the risks of forfeiting that right. See Commonwealth v. Barnette, 445 Pa. 288, 285 A.2d 141 (1971), and cases cited therein. In Commonwealth v. Barnette, supra, appellant attacked his conviction on the ground that he had not voluntarily, intelligently, and knowingly waived his constitutional right to the assistance of counsel during the jury selection stage of his trial. Due to an automobile breakdown Barnette\u2019s counsel was not present during the jury selection portion of the trial. The trial court had asked Barnette if he would be willing to have his co-defendant\u2019s counsel participate on his behalf in the selection of the jury, and Barnette had replied that he was agreeable. On appeal, we reversed, having concluded that Barnette was not \u201c \u2018made fully aware\u2019 in a constitutional sense of his right to counsel.\u201d Id. at 291, 285 A.2d at 143. Our conclusion was based on the fact that the defendant Barnette was not informed of the alternatives existing to his allowing co-defendant\u2019s counsel to participate on his behalf in the jury selection. We stated that no attempt was made to ascertain whether \u201c [the] accused\u2019s professed waiver of counsel [was] understandingly and wisely made [through] a penetrating and comprehensive examination of all the circumstances. . . .\u201d Id. at 292, 285 A.2d at 143, quoting from Commonwealth ex rel. McCray v. Rundle, 415 Pa. 65, 70, 202 A.2d 303, 305 (1964), and Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 724, 68 S.Ct. 316, 323, 92 L.Ed. 309, 321 (1948). Only through such a \u201cpenetrating and comprehensive examination of all the circumstances\u201d can the trial court ensure that defendant is aware of the intricacies of the proceeding, and of the consequences of his waiver of the right to have counsel represent him.\nThe trial court forced appellant in the instant case to either accept court appointed counsel with whom an irreconcilable difference as to the manner in which the trial should be conducted had arisen, a difference which was corroborated by counsel, or to represent himself. In so doing, the court presented appellant with the same \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d given to the appellant in Commonwealth v. Barnette, supra, and such action does not comport with the constitutional standards required to be met before a court may accept an alleged waiver of one\u2019s constitutional right to representation by counsel.\nJudgment of sentence is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.\nEAGEN, J., concurred in the result."}
