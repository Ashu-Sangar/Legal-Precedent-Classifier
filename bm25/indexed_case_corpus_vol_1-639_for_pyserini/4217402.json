{"id": "4217402", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice SAYLOR.\nAppeal was allowed to determine whether the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law of 1963 authorizes a union\u2019s employee benefits trust fund to file a mechanics\u2019 lien claim on behalf of union members who performed work for a construction contractor.\nAccording to the allegations in the complaints filed by the trust funds (appellees herein), William Pustelak, Inc., a construction contractor (\u201cContractor\u201d), entered into collective bargaining agreements (\u201cCBAs\u201d) with two unions, Bricklayers and Trowel Trades International, Local No. 9, and Laborers District Council of Western Pennsylvania (the \u201cUnions\u201d). The CBAs specified, inter alia, that, when Contractor needed bricklayers and/or laborers, Contractor would obtain them from the Unions. The CBAs also referred to Contractor as \u201cEmployer,\u201d and to any union members hired by Contractor in accordance with the CBAs as Contractor\u2019s \u201cemployees.\u201d The CBAs additionally required Contractor to furnish contributions for employee benefits, such as health and retirement benefits, for each hour of labor performed by union workers. Under the CBAs, the contribution amounts were to be reflected in monthly reports issued by Contractor, and the contributions were to be paid directly to Appellees, who are trustees of Bricklayers of Western Pennsylvania Combined Funds, Inc., and Laborers\u2019 Combined Funds, Inc. (the \u201cTrustees\u201d), and who acted as agents to collect such monies on behalf of the union workers. These arrangements were set forth in trust agreements that were incorporated by reference into the CBAs.\nWhile the CBAs were in effect, appellant Scott\u2019s Development Company (\u201cDeveloper\u201d) hired Contractor to complete a construction project on land owned by Developer, situated in Erie County and located within the Unions\u2019 territory. Because the project required bricklayers and laborers, Contractor, in turn, hired such craftsmen who, notably, were members of the Unions. These workers performed the necessary tasks in a satisfactory manner, and Contractor filed monthly reports as required. Contractor, however, failed to supply the benefit contributions to the trust funds.\nThe Trustees each filed a Statement of Mechanics\u2019 Lien Claim against Developer in the common pleas court pursuant to the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law of 1963. The Trustees then filed Complaints to Enforce Mechanics\u2019 Lien Claim, seeking recovery of unpaid employee benefit contributions totaling approximately $42,000, together with interest, penalties, fees, and costs. Developer raised a preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer as to each complaint, alleging that the Trustees lacked standing to assert a mechanics\u2019 lien claim on behalf of the unionized workers because such workers were employees of Contractor and, as such, were neither \u201ccontractors\u201d nor \u201csubcontractors.\u201d Developer noted, in this regard, that the CBAs predated the project in question and referred to Contractor as \u201cEmployer\u201d and to the union workers as \u201cemployees.\u201d Developer additionally asserted that the complaints sought to force it to fund Contractor\u2019s obligations to the Trustees. Developer argued that the Trustees\u2019 proper means of redress should be via a breach-of-contract action against Contractor. The Trustees filed answers to the preliminary objections.\nThe common pleas court disposed of the demurrers in two substantively identical speaking orders. In its orders, the court essentially agreed with Developer\u2019s position, concluding that the union members who provided labor for the construction project were employees of Contractor and not employees of the unions or of the Trustees. In this respect, the court did not view the CBAs as subcontractor agreements, but rather, as agreements made on behalf of Contractor\u2019s employees defining working conditions, compensation, and other terms. Consequently, the court held that the unionized workers did not come within the meaning of \u201csubcontractor\u201d as that term is defined by the 1963 Act. See Bricklayers of W. Pa. Com bined Funds v. Scott\u2019s Dev. Co., Civil No. 12538-2009, Order at 2 (C.P.Erie, Mar. 25, 2010), reproduced in R.R. 241 a; Laborers Combined Funds of W. Pa. v. Scott\u2019s Dev. Co., Civil No. 12514-2009, Order at 2 (C.P.Erie, Mar. 25, 2010), reproduced in R.R. 243a. The Trustees appealed to the Superior Court and filed Rule 1925(b) statements in compliance with the common pleas court\u2019s directive. See Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). However, the court did not issue a Rule 1925(a) opinion, presumably relying on the reasoning reflected in its March 25th orders.\nThe Superior Court consolidated the Funds\u2019 appeals and reversed. See Bricklayers of W. Pa. Combined Funds, Inc. v. Scott\u2019s Dev. Co., 41 A.3d 16 (Pa.Super.2012) (en banc). The majority determined that the term \u201csubcontractor\u201d should be given a broad interpretation, as the 1963 Act is remedial in nature and, as such, should be liberally construed to further its purposes. See generally Matternas v. Stehman, 434 Pa.Super. 255, 264, 642 A.2d 1120, 1124 (1994) (\u201cThe Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law of 1963 was intended to protect ... prepayment labor and materials that a contractor invests in another\u2019s property, by allowing the contractor to obtain a lien interest in the property involved.\u201d). While recognizing that the intermediate court\u2019s previous decisions indicated that the enactment is subject to strict construction as a statute in derogation of the common law, see Bricklayers, 41 A.3d at 24 (collecting cases), the majority stated that such decisions improperly relied on case law from this Court interpreting the 1963 Act\u2019s predecessor statute, the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law of 1901. The court pointed out that, under the Statutory Construction Act, the rule of strict construction for statutes in derogation of the common law is inapplicable to statutes enacted finally after September 1, 1937, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(a), and that, with certain limited exceptions not presently applicable, all other provisions of a statute should be liberally construed to \u201ceffect their objects and promote justice.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1928(c). Accordingly, the majority suggested that, notwithstanding its prior case law, a liberal construction should pertain relative to the 1963 Act.\nApplying such construction, the intermediate court agreed with Developer and the common pleas court that the CBAs do not constitute subcontracts between Contractor and the Unions, primarily because they do not relate to a specific, identifiable \u201cimprovement\u201d for purposes of the relevant statutory definitions. See 49 P.S. \u00a7 1201(1), (5) (respectively defining \u201cimprovement\u201d and \u201csubcontractor\u201d). Instead, the court reasoned, the CBAs merely establish Contractor\u2019s obligation to employ union members for specific types of work, and govern the terms of employment whenever Contractor would hire such persons to work on a project. See Bricklayers, 41 A.3d at 29.\nStill, although the Funds did not raise an implied-contract theory in their complaints, their Rule 1925(b) statements, or their brief, the Superior Court determined, sua sponte, that implied-in-fact contracts between Contractor and the Unions \u2014 for the specific construction project in question \u2014 could be discerned from the averments set forth in the complaints. See 49 P.S. \u00a7 1201(5) (defining the term subcontractor to include one who has a contract with a contractor that is \u201cexpress or implied\u201d). In particular, the majority reasoned that, pursuant to the CBAs, the Unions furnished its members to Contractor to perform the necessary work on the improvement, and those individuals undertook such work with an expectation that Contractor would fulfill its obligations under the CBAs\u2019 employee-benefit provisions. See Bricklayers, 41 A.3d at 30. Therefore, according to the majority, the complaints\u2019 allegations, if accepted as true, established that the Unions were subcontractors for purposes of the 1963 Act. Referencing case law from other jurisdictions, the majority then held that the Trustees, standing in the shoes of the union members for purposes of collecting the employee-benefit monies, had legal standing to assert the mechanics\u2019 liens. See id. at 30-32 (discussing cases from other jurisdictions).\nJudge Olson dissented, initially faulting the majority for relying on an implied-contract theory which was not argued by the Trustees. See Bricklayers, 41 A.3d at 36-37 (Olson, J., dissenting) (citing Rabatin v. Allied Glove Corp., 24 A.3d 388, 396 (Pa.Super.2011) (indicating that the Superior Court \u201cmay not act as counsel for an appellant and develop arguments on his behalf\u2019)); see also In re R.D., 44 A.3d 657, 674 (Pa.Super.2012) (same). Although Judge Olson agreed that the act should be liberally construed, she reasoned that, since the Unions did not furnish any labor or materials, even under a liberal interpretation the Unions could not be considered \u201csubcontractors\u201d pursuant to implied-contract theory, as such an interpretation would not effect the act\u2019s objects. Finally, Judge Olson differed with the majority\u2019s reliance on case law from other jurisdictions to conclude that the Trustees stand in the shoes of the union members. Stating that \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s mechanics\u2019 lien statute is relatively unique to our nation,\u201d Bricklayers, 41 A.3d at 38, Judge Olson concluded:\nThe problem ... is that the majority never explains how the union members \u2014 who are defined under the collective bargaining agreements as employees of the contractor \u2014 might qualify as subcontractors under the statute. Rather, the majority jumps over this hurdle by citing to foreign law and borrowing the final conclusion from those foreign cases: that \u2014 since a trustee of an employment benefit fund \u201cstands in the shoes\u201d of a union member for unpaid benefit contributions \u2014 the trustee has standing to assert a mechanics\u2019 lien claim in Pennsylvania.\nId.\nJudge Gantman also dissented, taking the position that the 1963 Act\u2019s remedies should not be available where the right to receive benefit payments arises under a contract between a general contractor and a union, when such a contract is independent from and \u201ccollateral\u201d or \u201ctangential\u201d to the construction project. Under such circumstances, Judge Gantman indicated, the majority\u2019s \u201cliberal construction\u201d \u201cstretches the statute beyond the legislative intent[.]\u201d Bricklayers, 41 A.3d at 41 (Gantman, J., dissenting). While agreeing that the Trustees are legally entitled to collect benefit payments pursuant to the CBAs, the dissent reasoned that they already have the means to do so by commencing a breach-of-contract action against Contractor. Therefore, the dissent argued, interpreting the act to support a mechanics\u2019 lien against Developer, under the circumstances, effectively makes Developer a surety for Contractor\u2019s independent obligations, thereby \u201cburdening] the 'wrong entity.\u201d Id.\nWe allowed limited further review to consider the following issues as framed by Developer: whether the Superior Court erred in concluding that the 1963 Act should be liberally construed; whether even a liberal construction of the act would permit an employee of a contractor to assert a claim as a subcontractor; and whether the Superior Court erred in sua sponte finding that implied-in-fact contracts control the parties\u2019 rights under the act. See Bricklayers of W. Pa. Combined Funds, Inc. v. Scott\u2019s Dev. Co., 619 Pa. 166, 58 A.3d 748 (2012) (per curiam).\nDeveloper argues for strict construction of the 1963 Act primarily based on the Superior Court\u2019s reasoning in Sampson-Miller Associated Cos. v. Landmark Realty Co., 224 Pa.Super. 25, 303 A.2d 43 (1973). Developer characterizes that case as providing an exhaustive analysis of the relationship between the 1901 and 1963 statutes and concluding that the latter merely recodified the former. On this basis, Developer maintains that the present law should be considered as dating from the 1901 enactment date of its predecessor.\nDeveloper also claims that this Court has applied a strict construction to the 1963 Act, see Brief for Appellant, at 17-18 (citing Am. Seating Co. v. City of Phila., 434 Pa. 370, 376-77, 256 A.2d 599, 602 (1969)), and discusses a common pleas court decision strictly construing the present statute to conclude that an employee of a contractor or subcontractor may not file a mechanics\u2019 lien under the 1963 Act. See id. at 18-19 (citing Liebow v. Eagle Downs Racing Ass\u2019n, 1 Pa. D. & C.3d 671, 672-73 (C.P. Bucks, June 2, 1976), aff'd, 244 Pa.Super. 545, 371 A.2d 518 (1976) (per curiam)). Moreover, and in any event, Developer asserts that, as a matter of policy, a result favoring the Trustees would be antithetical to the purposes of the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law, as the Trustees tendered none of the outlays invested in the property.\nAn amicus curiae consisting of several contractor associations adds that the Superior Court erred in two respects. First, it states that the court\u2019s application of the tools of statutory construction \u2014 including the liberal-construction provision reflected in Section 1928 of the Statutory Construction Act \u2014 was ill-advised because the court had already determined that the 1963 Act is \u201cclear and free from ambiguity and must be construed according to its plain and natural meaning.\u201d Bricklayers, 41 A.3d at 24. Second, amicus maintains that the intermediate court should have ended its inquiry once it concluded that the Trustees were not themselves contractors or subcontractors under the statute, since they did not perform any work on, or furnish any materials to, the project in question. See id. at 19.\nThe Trustees reply that a liberal construction based on the mandate of Section 1928 of the Statutory Construction Act is appropriate here, as the 1963 Act was passed long after September 1, 1937. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(a), (c). In this respect, the Trustees highlight that amendments to the statute in 2006 expanded the definition of subcontractor, see Act of June 29, 2006, P.L. 210, No. 52 (broadening \u201csubcontractor\u201d to include persons who furnish labor \u201cpursuant to a contract with a subcontractor in direct privity of a contract with a contractor\u201d), again supporting the view that the present provision should not be understood as a mere reenactment of the 1901 law. The Trustees also claim that this Court has never expressly interpreted the 1963 Act strictly. As for Developer\u2019s reference to American Seating, the Trustees acknowledge that that case cited with approval to Murray v. Zemon, 402 Pa. 354, 167 A.2d 253 (1960), and that Murray applied a strict construction of the 1901 act. However, the Trustees note that it was only the dissent in American Seating that specifically referenced the strict-construction aspect of Murray. Moreover, the Trustees argue that this Court has recognized that the 1963 Act \u201ceffected a substantial change in the law,\u201d Brief for Appellees, at 15 (citing McCarthy v. Reese, 419 Pa. 489, 490 n. 1, 215 A.2d 257, 258 n. 1 (1966)), thus undermining Developer\u2019s contention that it should be strictly construed on the grounds that it is a mere reenactment of the 1901 act.\nAs well, the Trustees acknowledge that \u2014 as was highlighted in Sampson-Miller \u2014 when the 1963 law was passed, the Pennsylvania Constitution contained a provision forbidding any special law \u201cauthorizing the ... extension ... of liens\u201d or \u201cproviding or changing methods for the collection of debts.\u201d Pa. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 7 (1874); see Fluke v. Lang, 283 Pa. 54, 58, 128 A. 663, 664 (1925). However, the Trustees stress that this restriction was repealed in the 1968 Constitution and, as such, can no longer be relied on to support strictly construing the 1963 Act, particularly in light of the guidance provided by the Statutory Construction Act and the fact that changes to the definition of \u201csubcontractor\u201d were made even more recently in 2006, as noted above.\nEven if the statute is strictly construed, the Trustees contend that the Unions \u2014 and, by corollary, the Trustees \u2014 meet the statutory definition of \u201csubcontractor\u201d based solely on the CBAs, inasmuch as the agreements constitute express contracts to provide labor for Contractor\u2019s construction projects within the Unions\u2019 geographic territory. Contrary to the Superior Court\u2019s interpretation, the Trustees maintain that the 1963 Act does not facially require that a contract relate to a specific improvement, thus rendering unnecessary the intermediate court\u2019s analysis based on implied-in-fact contracts. See Brief for Appellees, at 42 (explaining that the definition of \u201csubcontractor\u201d requires only that, \u201cas a result of a contract (such as the CBAs), the subcontractor ... furnishes labor, materials, services or any combination thereof for an improvement that the contractor has agreed to build for a property owner\u201d). The Trustees also point out that the statute does not expressly preclude the possibility that a contractor\u2019s agreement with a subcontractor might predate a construction contract with a property owner.\nSeparately, the Trustees discount any general distinction between \u201cemployees\u201d and \u201csubcontractors,\u201d stating that, even if the union workers are deemed employees of Contractor, they still meet the statutory definition of \u201csubcontractor\u201d because they furnished labor to an improvement pursuant to a contract with Contractor. See 49 P.S. \u00a7 1201(5). The Trustees posit that the statute\u2019s express exclusion of laborers should be viewed as referring only to \u201cday laborers asserting mechanics\u2019 liens without documentation of their work, i.e., a contract.\u201d Brief for Appellees at 51.\n\u201cAs this matter implicates an issue of statutory interpretation, our task is to determine the will of the General Assembly using the language of the statute as our primary guide.\u201d Osprey Portfolio, LLC v. Izett, 620 Pa. 274, 281, 67 A.3d 749, 754 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). See generally 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(a) (\u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d). When the words of a statute are clear and precise, reviewing courts may not disregard those words under the pretext of pursuing the \u201cspirit\u201d of the enactment. See id. \u00a7 1921(b). Where, however, there is a conflict or ambiguity, we may resort to the tools of statutory construction. See Oliver v. City of Pittsburgh, 608 Pa. 386, 394, 11 A.3d 960, 965 (2011). In so doing, we keep in mind that such tools are used as an aid in uncovering the intent of the Legislature, which is always the objective in matters of statutory construction. See Commonwealth v. Baker, 547 Pa. 214, 221, 690 A.2d 164, 167 (1997).\nMechanics\u2019 liens were unknown at common law and are entirely a creature of statute. See Davis v. Farr, 13 Pa. (1 Harris) 166, 169 (1850). Such liens are designed to protect persons who, before being paid (or fully paid), provide labor or material to improve a piece of property. See generally Matternas v. Stehman, 434 Pa.Super. 255, 264, 642 A.2d 1120, 1124 (1994) (\u201cThe Mechanics\u2019 Lien Law of 1963 was intended to protect the prepayment labor and materials that a contractor invests in another\u2019s property!.]\u201d). Mechanics\u2019 liens accomplish this goal by giving lienholders security for their payment independent of contractual remedies. See, e.g., Flynn Build ers, L.C. v. Lande, 814 N.W.2d 542, 545 (Iowa 2012). See generally Sampson-Miller, 224 Pa. Super, at 26-27, 303 A.2d at 43 (indicating that mechanics\u2019 liens \u201crepresent a special remedy in favor of a unique class of creditors\u201d).\nThe primary interpretive matter involved in this case pertains to the scope of the term \u201csubcontractor\u201d as that word is defined in the 1963 Act. The most salient provisions of the act for present purposes are Section 201(5), which defines \u201csubcontractor,\u201d see supra note 4, and Section 303(a), which states that no lien is allowed in favor of any person other than a contractor or subcontractor, even though such person furnishes labor or materials to an improvement, see supra note 3. If these provisions are viewed side-by-side and the text is taken literally without reference historical context, they are at odds with one another. Section 201(5), on its face, states that any person who furnishes labor to an improvement pursuant to a contract with the contractor qualifies as a subcontractor, see 49 P.S. \u00a7 1201(5) \u2014 and, indeed, the Trustees argue that \u201cany employee of a \u2018contractor\u2019 meets the definition of a \u2018subcontractor\u2019 \u201d because the employee furnishes labor, skill, or superintendence in exchange for agreed-upon compensation, see Brief for Appellees, at 47. On the other hand, Section 303(a) plainly contemplates a class of persons who furnish labor to an improvement, but who are not subcontractors and therefore are not entitled to file a mechanics\u2019 lien. See 49 P.S. \u00a7 1303(a). Since the union members who provided labor for the construction project on Developer\u2019s land did so pursuant to an employment agreement of some sort \u2014 whether oral or written, or only implied in fact \u2014 it is not immediately clear whether they are meant to be included as subcontractors by Section 201(5), or excluded by Section 303(a). We must therefore look behind the plain language of the statute to other factors, again, keeping in mind that the primary goal is to give effect to legislative intent.\nOne such factor is that the most natural meaning of the word \u201csubcontractor\u201d simply does not denote the employees of a contractor. See generally 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a) (indicating that statutory words should be construed according to their common usage). Rather, a subcontractor is generally understood to be a person or business \u201cwho performs for and takes from the prime contractor a specific part of the labor or material requirements of the original contract, thus excluding ordinary laborers and materialmen.\u201d Clifford F. MacEvoy Co. v. United States for Use & Benefit of Calvin Tomkins, 322 U.S. 102, 109, 64 S.Ct. 890, 894, 88 L.Ed. 1163 (1944) (emphasis added). Consistent with such an understanding, this Court has uniformly held that a contractor\u2019s employees do not constitute subcontractors covered by mechanics\u2019 lien legislation. This is especially significant because the official legislative comments indicate that the Court\u2019s decisional law overlay-in this respect was meant to persist. See 49 P.S. \u00a7 1201, Comment \u2014 Joint State Government Commission 1964 Report, Subdivision (5) (\u201cPrior decisional law that laborers are not subcontractors, even though employed by a contractor, remains unchanged.\u201d); 49 P.S. \u00a7 1303, Comment \u2014 Joint State Government Commission 1964 Report, Subdivision (a) (\u201cThis subsection ... declares existing decisional law and ... has been placed in Section 303 as a caveat.\u201d). Hence, the Legislature\u2019s choice of the word \u201csubcontractor,\u201d as opposed to \u201cemployee,\u201d together with our precedent and the Commission\u2019s commentary, all militate against an interpretation whereby any employee of a contractor is considered a \u201csubcontractor.\u201d\n[7] The Legislature may have sought to ensure the continuation of the same restrictions on the term \u201csubcontractor\u201d as were already understood to exist, because, as recited, the organic law then in effect prohibited statutes authorizing the extension of liens or providing or changing methods for the collection of debts. See Pa. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 7 (1874). Although that provision has since been repealed, its vitality at the time the 1963 Act was passed suggests that the act was not intended to extend the class of lien claimants. The Legislature is presumed not to intentionally pass unconstitutional laws, and courts give statutes a constitutional interpretation if that is reasonably possible. See Fluke v. Lang, 283 Pa. 54, 58, 128 A. 663, 664 (1924). In Fluke, this Court determined that the \u201capparently broad language\u201d of a clause in the 1901 mechanics\u2019 lien law must be limited to ensure that it did not violate then-Article III, Section 7. Id. As amicus cogently states, \u201c[(Consistent with the Fluke decision, it should be presumed that the 1963[Act], enacted prior to the 1968 Pennsylvania Constitution, would necessarily have to be in compliance with the prior iterations of the Pennsylvania Constitution adopted in 1874[.]\u201d Brief for Amicus, at 20. The 2006 revision to the definition of \u201csubcontractor\u201d is not directly pertinent in this regard, as it only increases the level of potential subcontractor claimants by one or more tiers, but does not otherwise alter the fundamental criteria needed to qualify as a subcontractor in the first instance. Accord id. at 16 n. 2.\nAs well, we presume that the Legislature had some reason for including Section 303(a) as part of the 1963 version of the act. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(2) (reflecting a presumption that the General Assembly intends all aspects of a statute to have some effect). In particular, the Legislature must be assumed to have had in view some actual class of \u201cperson[s who] furnish[ ] labor or materials to an improvement,\u201d but who were not intended to qualify as contractors or subcontractors. If all of a contractor\u2019s employees were automatically deemed to be subcontractors, it is difficult to imagine who this class of persons might be. Here again, the official comment to Section 201(5) supplies the answer: \u201claborers are not subcontractors even though employed by a contractor!!]\u201d\nFinally, it is proper to consider the consequences of different interpretations. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(6); see also id. \u00a7 1922(1) (reflecting that the General Assembly does not intend an unreasonable result). Pennsylvania permits a subcontractor to file a lien claim directly against the property, even if the owner is not in default. See 49 P.S. \u00a7 1301. Such a lien may subsume \u201call debts\u201d owed to the subcontractor for labor or materials. Id. Although the legislative body has thus chosen to permit a property owner to be held responsible to ensure that subcontractors are paid, see supra note 9, construing the class of claimants to include all of a contractor\u2019s employees would force private property owners to become guarantors of contractors\u2019 general employment obligations and create an entirely new class of \u201csubcontractors,\u201d thus exposing the subject property to significantly increased liability. This Court has previously commented that such a regime would be burdensome to the undertaking of new construction. See Jobsen, 8 Pa. (8 Barr.) at 465 (\u201cThis restricted construction seems to be absolutely necessary to the safety of the proprietors of newly-erected buildings.... [Tjheir property is exposed to a double lien for the same work done and materials furnished; one in favour of the contractor ... and another to secure the master-workmen employed by him. Were the plaintiffs construction of the statute admitted, to these would be superadded the lien of every individual workman engaged by the principal____This would soon be felt as intolerable.\u201d); cf. 73 Am.Jur. Statutes \u00a7 179 (\u201cStatutes are generally subject to a strict construction where they interfere with private property rights or are in derogation of rights of individual ownership!.]\u201d).\nIn light of the above, we believe that it would be improper to endorse such a change absent legislation that more clearly evinces that intent. Particularly inasmuch as the evidence that we do have, as summarized above, points mostly in the opposite direction, we disagree with the Trustees\u2019 position to the extent they suggest that the Legislature intended for a contractor\u2019s employees to be considered \u201csubcontractors\u201d by virtue of the definitional section of the 1963 Act.\nTurning to the Superior Court\u2019s consideration of contracts implied in fact, Developer initially maintains that, since the Trustees waived this argument, the intermediate court exceeded its scope of review by ruling on the issue. See Steiner v. Markel, 600 Pa. 515, 522, 968 A.2d 1253, 1257 (2009) (\u201cWhere the parties fail to preserve an issue for appeal, the Superior Court may not address that issue sua sponte.\u201d). Developer alternatively submits that the Superior Court erred in its substantive analysis in two interrelated ways. First, according to Developer, the court relied on the collective bargaining agreements to find an implied contract, whereas none of the authority it cited supports an implied-contract theory based on an express contract. Second, Developer contends that any implied contract that the intermediate court found cannot have been valid in any event because it was wholly lacking in consideration. In this latter respect, Developer posits that all of the actions performed by the parties in relation to the construction project \u2014 including Contractor\u2019s hiring of union members, the union workers\u2019 provision of labor and bricklaying services, and Contractor\u2019s responsibility to pay compensation as agreed upon \u2014 were undertaken pursuant to obligations already existing by virtue of the CBAs. Developer references Cohen v. Sabin, 452 Pa. 447, 307 A.2d 845 (1973), for the precept that \u201cperformance of that which one is already legally obligated to do is not consideration sufficient to support a valid agreement,\u201d id. at 453, 307 A.2d at 849; accord In re Commonwealth Trust Co., 357 Pa. 349, 354, 54 A.2d 649, 651 (1947) (\u201cWhere a legal obligation exists, a cumulative promise to perform it, unless upon a new consideration, is a nullity.\u201d), quoted in Brief for Appellant, at 26, and ultimately concludes that under this precedent a valid implied-in-fact contract cannot have been formed.\nThe Trustees initially deny that the Superior Court was precluded from undertaking the inquiry. They distinguish Steiner by arguing that the decision only prohibits appellate courts from considering causes of action that were not pled, but it does not prevent them from relying on new legal theories to support a cause of action that appears in the complaint. In this respect, the Trustees argue that they were not required to identify all theories that might support their claim based on the facts as alleged. More particularly, they reason that such facts adequately support the implied-contract formulation that the Superior Court fashioned as a basis for concluding that the cause of action for enforcement of a mechanics\u2019 lien claim should not have been dismissed on preliminary objections.\n\u201c[T]he question presented by [a] demurrer is whether, on the facts aveired, the law says with certainty that no recovery is possible.\u201d Bilt-Rite Contractors, Inc. v. The Architectural Studio, 581 Pa. 454, 461, 866 A.2d 270, 274 (2005) (emphasis added). It is thus improper for a reviewing court to overrule a demurrer based on legal theories that are untethered to the factual basis for liability as alleged by the plaintiff. See Steiner, 600 Pa. at 527, 968 A.2d at 1260 (\u201cThe courts should not recast a pleading in a way not intended by the parties.\u201d). This type of review subjects defendants to shifting theories of liability that they cannot anticipate from the face of the pleading. Although the rules of civil procedure are to be liberally construed, see Pa.R.C.P. 126, the complaint must nonetheless apprise the defendant of the claim being asserted and summarize the essential supporting facts. In Seebold v. Prison Health Services, Inc., 618 Pa. 632, 57 A.3d 1232 (2012), for example, the plaintiff \u2014 a prison guard \u2014 alleged that prison doctors had breached a duty to warn her directly that an inmate had an infectious disease. On appeal from the sustaining of a demurrer, the plaintiff argued that the case should have proceeded to fact-finding because a jury might have concluded that advising the inmate on how to avoid spreading the infection would have discharged the doctor\u2019s alleged duty to third parties. This Court rejected the plaintiffs belated attempt to alter her theory of liability. See id. at 657-59, 57 A.3d at 1248.\nHere, all of the allegations appearing in the Trustees\u2019 statements of mechanics\u2019 lien, and in their complaints, reference the CBAs as such, and the actions undertaken pursuant to those agreements, as the basis for liability. Additionally, and as noted, the Trustees\u2019 Rule 1925(b) statements make no mention of a supposed implied contract between Contractor and the Unions; instead, they are consistent with the complaints in relying solely on the CBAs as the predicate for the Trustees\u2019 purported subcontractor status. See Bricklayers of W. Pa. Combined Funds, Inc. v. Scott\u2019s Dev. Co., No. 12533-2009, Concise Statement of Matters Complaint of on Appeal, at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8, 11, reproduced in R.R. 260a-261a; Laborers Combined Funds of W. Pa. v. Scott\u2019s Dev. Co., No. 12514-2009, Concise Statement of Matters Complaint of on Appeal, at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8,11, reproduced in R.R. 265a-266a.\nIn this regard, it may be noted that a contract implied in fact \u201carises when the intention of the parties is not expressed, but an agreement in fact creating an obligation is implied or presumed from their acts[.]\u201d In re Montgomery\u2019s Estate, 299 Pa. 452, 457-58, 149 A. 705, 707 (1930). The \u201cnot expressed\u201d criterion is presently significant because, as explained, all of the parties\u2019 actions and obligations were alleged to have been undertaken pursuant to intentions that were expressed in the CBAs: in the event Contractor needed workers for a construction project, it was to hire union members to perform the job; the union workers furnished satisfactory skill and labor for the project in question, for which they were contractually entitled to have employee-benefit contributions paid to the Trustees; and the alleged breach occurred when Contractor failed to make the benefit payments as required by the CBAs. Although the CBAs were executed before the specific construction project on Developer\u2019s land was contemplated, they stated the parties\u2019 intentions and controlled their obligations relative to the project, as the Trustees forcefully argue. See Brief for Appellees, at 41-42. Thus, no additional obligations needed to be assumed, and no additional promises needed to be made, for the CBAs to be fully applicable with respect to the construction project \u2014 nor were any actions or requirements alleged to have arisen in relation to the project separate and apart from the express provisions contained in the CBAs. Therefore, the concept that implied contracts were formed between the Unions and Contractor in relation to the improvement on Developer\u2019s property is too attenuated to withstand scrutiny. Put simply, the complaints cannot reasonably be interpreted as alleging the existence of implied contracts between the Unions and Contractor, or as summarizing the essential facts to support such a contention. See generally McShea, 606 Pa. at 98, 995 A.2d at 340 (\u201cWhere a pleading is straightforward, such as here, there can be no reworking of the claim so as to create a different theory of recovery.\u201d). The Superior Court, for its part, simply \u201crecast [the] pleading[s] in a way not intended by the parties.\u201d Steiner, 600 Pa. at 527, 968 A.2d at 1260.\nEven if implied contracts between Contractor and the Unions could be discerned from the averments, the Trustees never claimed to attain subcontractor status by standing in the shoes of the Unions. See supra note 5; accord Brief for Amicus, at 10 (\u201c[T]he unions are not the claimants in these cases, nor do they claim to be owed anything.\u201d). The substantive allegations in the mechanics\u2019 lien claims and the complaints to enforce them are uniformly phrased in terms of the \u201cunion members\u201d or \u201cmembers of the union.\u201d Hence, the Trustees only asserted that union workers were denied their employee benefit payments, and made no contention on behalf of the Unions as such. Although the Superior Court overlooked this distinction in formulating its implied-contract theory, we find the difference significant. The General Assembly has provided that \u201c[n]o lien shall be allowed in favor of any person other than a contractor or subcontractor.]\u201d 49 P.S. \u00a7 1303(a). The precision thus required in regard to the filing of mechanics\u2019 liens cannot simply be ignored, nor can the Unions and the union workers be considered legally interchangeable for such purposes. As the Trustees did not assert a debt due and owing to the Unions, any implied contracts with the Unions would be insufficient in the circumstances to authorize the Trustees to file mechanics\u2019 liens to secure the union workers\u2019 benefits.\nIn summary, we conclude that the union workers were not subcontractors, and the Trustees, by corollary in their representative capacity, were not entitled to file a lien claim on the workers\u2019 behalf. Although the 1963 Act is intended to protect subcontractors who suffer harm occasioned by the primary contractor\u2019s failure to meet its obligations, we have determined that the Legislature did not intend the term \u201csubcontractor\u201d to subsume employees of the primary contractor. Furthermore, the Superior Court erred in overturning the demurrers based on an implied-in-fact contract theory.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for reinstatement of the county court\u2019s order sustaining Developer\u2019s preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer.\nFormer Justice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices EAKIN, BAER, TODD and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\n. Because this appeal arises out of the sustaining of demurrers, the background is drawn from the complaints and developed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. See Gresik v. PA Partners, L.P., 613 Pa. 303, 304 n. 1, 33 A.3d 594, 595 n. 1 (2011).\n. Act of August 24, 1963, P.L. 1175, No. 497 (as amended, 49 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101-1902) (the \"1963 Act\u201d).\n. Under the 1963 Act, \"[n]o lien shall be allowed in favor of any person other than a contractor or subcontractor, as defined herein, even though such person furnishes labor or materials to an improvement.\u201d 49 P.S. \u00a7 1303(a).\n. The act defines subcontractor as:\none who, by contract with the contractor, or pursuant to a contract with a subcontractor in direct privity of a contract with a contractor, express or implied, erects, constructs, alters or repairs an improvement or any part thereof; or furnishes labor, skill or superintendence thereto; or supplies or hauls materials, fixtures, machinery or equipment reasonably necessary for and actually used therein; or any or all of the foregoing, whether as superintendent, builder or material-man. The term does not include an architect or engineer who contracts with a contractor or subcontractor, or a person who contracts with a materialman or a person who contracts with a subcontractor not in direct privity of a contract with a contractor.\n49 P.S. \u00a7 1201(5). See generally id., Comment \u2014 Joint State Gov't Comm\u2019n 1964 Report (\"Prior decisional law that laborers are not subcontractors, even though employed by a contractor, remains unchanged.\u201d).\n. In this respect, the majority arguably conflated the Unions and the unionized workers. Notably, the majority failed to recognize that the Trustees have never claimed to stand in the shoes of the Unions. In view of our conclusion, discussed below, that no implied-in-fact contracts were alleged, this circumstance is not ultimately dispositive.\n. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1961 (\"Whenever a statute reenacts a former statute, the provisions common to both statutes shall date from their first adoption. Such provisions only of the former statute as are omitted from the reenactment shall be deemed abrogated, and only the new or changed provisions shall be deemed to be the law from the effective date of the reenactment.\u201d); see also id. \u00a7 1962 (\"Whenever a statute is repealed and its provisions are at the same time reenacted in the same or substantially the same terms by the repealing statute, the earlier statute shall be construed as continued in active operation. All rights and liabilities incurred under such earlier statute are preserved and may be enforced.\"). See generally City of Erie v. Land Fronting on Se. Corner of Eighth & Peach Sts., 339 Pa. 321, 324-25, 14 A.2d 428, 430 (1940) (\"Where a statute is repealed and its provisions are at the same time re-enacted by the repealing act, the effect ... is that the earlier statute is not in fact repealed, but its provisions continue in active operation .... \u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n. Alternatively, in defense of the implied contract theory, the Trustees maintain that the theory was preserved, as the complaints sufficiently apprised Developer of the claim being asserted and summarized the essential facts necessary to support the claim, and that it need not have identified the specific, supportive legal theory. See Allegheny Cnty. v. Commonwealth, 507 Pa. 360, 372, 490 A.2d 402, 408 (1985) (\"If the facts as pleaded state a claim for which relief may be granted under any theory of law then there is sufficient doubt to require ... a demurrer to be rejected.\u201d). In terms of consideration, the Trustees advance that \"[t]he Unions\u2019 ability and willingness to meet [Contractor's] needs on the Improvement is the consideration for the contracts implied in fact relating to [Developer's] Improvement.\u201d Brief for Appellees, at 40.\n. The Trustees also argue that, to restrict their authority to file a mechanics\u2019 lien claim would violate the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), and that Section 303(a) of the 1963 Act, 49 P.S. \u00a7 1303(a), is preempted by ERISA. Neither issue is before the Court. Moreover, the Trustees\u2019 contention that ERISA requires their remedy to be available specifically via a mechanics\u2019 lien claim rests on the premise that they are subcontractors. See Brief for Appellees, at 28-30. Therefore, this argument cannot supply an independent basis for affirmance.\n. Some jurisdictions have recognized competing policies favoring the protection of property owners, as either provided for by statute, see Duffield Constr., Inc. v. Baldwin, 679 N.W.2d 477, 481 (S.D.2004) (quoting a portion of South Dakota\u2019s statute protecting landowners from liens arising from unauthorized improvements), or as stemming more generally from the circumstance that liens create an encumbrance on property that deprives the owner of his ability to convey clear title. See VCS, Inc. v. Utah Cmty. Bank, 293 P.3d 290, 295 & n. 12 (Utah 2012). Although such an encumbrance serves the primary purpose of the lien, it imposes a burden on the owner in circumstances where, through no fault of his own, the contractor is derelict in fulfilling its own obligations toward its subcontractors. For this reason, it has been argued, in the context of subcontractor liens, that the risk of double payment is unjust to the property owner \u2014 and, as noted, Developer raised a contention along these lines in its demurrers. Some commentators have answered that it is appropriate to incentivize property owners to take measures to protect the financial interests of those who increase the value of their property, and that this does not impose an undue hardship. See, e.g., Mechanics\u2019 Lien \u2014 Right of Subcontractor to Lien Regardless of Original Contract, 32 Harv. L. Rev. 178, 178 (1918). Pennsylvania's legislation mitigates any such harm, moreover, by subrogating the owner to the rights of, and security held by, the subcontractor, upon the owner\u2019s payment of a claim. See 49 P.S. \u00a7 1604(1). In all events, the General Assembly has evidently weighed these considerations and chosen to permit liens in favor of subcontractors, subject to statutory limitations. It is our duty, as a reviewing court, to enforce these rights, limitations, and any other policy choices made by the legislative body as they may be gleaned from the text of the statute. See Program Admin. Servs., Inc. v. Dauphin Cnty. Gen. Auth., 593 Pa. 184, 192, 928 A.2d 1013, 1017-18 (2007).\n. See Harlan v. Rand, 27 Pa. (3 Casey) 511, 515 (1856) (\"Yet [a contractor] cannot bind [the building] to the journeymen and labourers whom he is always presumed to employ for such work; for they are ... not considered as working on the credit of the building, but on faith in their employer.\u201d); Guthrie v. Horner, 12 Pa. (2 Jones) 236, 237 (1849) (\u201d[0]ur mechanics\u2019 lien law never did ... contemplate that every man who was hired by a contractor to work at a building had a right to file a lien for his wages.\u201d); Jobsen v. Boden, 8 Pa. (8 Barr.) 463, 463 (1848) (noting that \"a journeyman mechanic employed in working on a building, under the original contractor or master-mason, [may] not file a lien against the erection ... notwithstanding the general or comprehensive words of the statute, which, taken literally, would seem to include eveiy grade and class of workmen\u201d).\n. Although these official comments are not law, they may be given weight in the construction of the statute as they provide evidence of legislative intent. See Young v. Kaye, 443 Pa. 335, 348 n. 3, 279 A.2d 759, 765 n. 3 (1971).\n. We are not persuaded by the Trustees\u2019 suggestion that only day laborers working without a contract were meant to be excluded from the statute\u2019s definition of subcontractor. See Brief for Appellees, at 51. This principle is not reflected in the cases on which the Trustees rely for support, see, e.g., Boden, 8 Pa. (8 Barr.) at 463 (reflecting that the contractor and the plaintiff had agreed on the essential terms of employment); Harlan, 27 Pa. (3 Casey) at 515-16 (indicating that, under the statute then in effect, lien rights extended only to general contractors and their direct subcontractors, even where the claimant was employed pursuant to a contract with the subcontractor), nor is it reflected in our application of the principles of statutory construction, as reflected above.\n. The parties agree that the union workers were Contractor\u2019s employees and the Trustees do not argue that such workers were subcontractors on any other basis. Indeed, the CBAs refer to Contractor throughout as \"Employer\u201d and the workers as Contractor\u2019s \"employees.\u201d Thus, it is apparent that the CBAs were never intended to constitute \"subcontracts\u201d between Contractor and the Unions. Instead, they constitute agreements created for the benefit of a class of third-party union members and entered into in anticipation of Contractor's labor needs that might arise in the future.\n. Pennsylvania is a fact-pleading state. See McShea v. City of Phila., 606 Pa. 88, 96, 995 A.2d 334, 339 (2010).\n. See McShea, 606 Pa. at 98, 995 A.2d at 340; Steiner 600 Pa. at 526-27, 968 A.2d at 1260; Line Lexington Lumber & Millwork Co. v. Pa.

Pursuant to the CBA, the Contractor was to pay health, welfare, retirement and/or fringe benefits (\u201cContributions\u201d) to Claimant for each hour of labor performed by the Contractor\u2019s Union members in accordance with the rates set forth in the CBA.\n7. Pursuant to the CBA, the Trust Agreement incorporated into the CBA, and the applicable law, Claimant is the authorized agent on behalf of Union members to collect the Contributions which were to be paid by the Contractor in accordance with the CBA.\n8.

Contracts \u00a7 12 (2013) (same).\n. We do agree with the Superior Court that the Unions did not become subcontractors under the CBAs themselves. Although the intermediate court reached this conclusion because the CBAs do not specifically mention the construction project on Developer's property, we note that the Unions did not perform any work for Contractor. Rather, and as stated, the CBAs governed the terms of employment whenever Contractor might need workers for a construction project, and the union members \u2014 who did perform the work \u2014 were employees of Contractor, not the Unions.
