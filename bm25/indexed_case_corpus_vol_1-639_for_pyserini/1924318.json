{"id": "1924318", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nPetitioner\u2019s PCHA petition was denied after hearing, and he appealed to the Superior Court which affirmed per curiam. A petition for allocatur followed.\nThe entire petition reads as follows: \u201c1. On November 1, 1968, . . . the Superior Court of Pennsylvania filed a Per Curiam Order affirming the action of the Lower Court.\n\u201c2. The Superior Court failed to consider all the facts presented on behalf of the petitioner, in rendering its decision. The Superior Court failed to properly apply the law to the facts that were established.\n\u201cNotice of this petition has been served on the District Attorney of Delaware County.\u201d\nThe petition is typed, and is signed by the prisoner. The only indication that appointed counsel existed is the fact that the backer has the Public Defender\u2019s name on it. This Court requires counsel to prepare allocatur petitions, see Commonwealth v. Hickox, 433 Pa. 144, 249 A. 2d 777 (1969). Merely attaching a backer to a petition prepared by the prisoner, and submitting it to this Court, cannot be considered \u201crepresentation\u201d by counsel, cf. Commonwealth v. Villano, 435 Pa. 273, 256 A. 2d 468 (1969) (xeroxing prisoner\u2019s petition is inadequate). The Supreme Court of the United States, in a case considering whether an indigent had adequate representation on appeal, set out the standard which must guide us: \u201c[Representation in the role of an advocate is required.\u201d Ellis v. United States, 356 U.S. 674, 675, 78 S. Ct. 974, 975 (1958). By merely attaching a backer, the Public Defender does not fulfill this role.\nThe record is remanded to the hearing court so that counsel can file a proper petition for allocatur."}
