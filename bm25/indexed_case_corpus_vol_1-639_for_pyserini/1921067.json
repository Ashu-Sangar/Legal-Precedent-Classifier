{"id": "1921067", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nAppellants engaged in picketing outside the residence of Charles Hibbs, appellee, in order to protest his activities in connection with the rental of houses in low-income districts of Philadelphia. Hibbs carried on these activities under the name \u201cBen Reed\u201d in the following surreptitious manner. All business was conducted through the mail addressed to a post office box in Bala-Cynwyd, Pennsylvania. Each month the tenants sent their rent to \u201cBen Reed\u201d at that box. All complaints, including those concerning the lack of vital services such as heat and water, had to be sent through the mail, with the accompanying delays. The only available method by which the tenants could pay their rent or register their complaints was by resorting to this impersonal procedure. Although Hibbs maintained an insurance brokerage office, he stated that nothing in connection with his real estate activities was transacted at this office. Appellants, in order to publicize what they considered to be the deplorable activities of Hibbs and the manner in which he operated, conducted informational picketing at his home. After hearing, the lower court granted a preliminary injunction restraining the picketing. Certain of the picketers have taken an appeal to this Court. \u2022 \u25a0\nBecause of the secretive manner in which Hibbs was conducting his real estate business there was no other place to effectively communicate his activities. Under the circumstances, the residence is not an unreasonable situs to picket. When a landlord conducts his business in a manner to avoid detection and' not at a regular place of business, informational picketing may not be enjoined for the sole reason that tenants and others resorted to picketing the landlord\u2019s home.\nAppellants would have us weigh the First Amendment right of free speech that accompanies informational. picketing against Hibbs\u2019 right of privacy and establish a blanket rule permitting residential picketing. .We will not do this since this is not a true case of residential picketing. Here, because of the manner in which appellee conducted his business, the residence of appellee became a proper situs for informational picketing.\nWe feel a further word is necessary concerning appellee\u2019s conduct on this appeal. Appellee did not submit a brief or participate in oral argument. In a c\u00e1se as delicate as this it would have been to appellee\u2019s advantage to have presented the arguments which support his position. It is not so much as a slight to us, but a courtesy owed to the lower court.\nDecree reversed, at appellees\u2019 cost.\nMr. Justice Pomeroy concurs in the result.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nSee two articles in this area: Kamin, Residential Picketing and the First Amendment, 61 Nw.
