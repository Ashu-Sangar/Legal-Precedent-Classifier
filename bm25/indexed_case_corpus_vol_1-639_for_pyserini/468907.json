{"id": "468907", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Patterson,\nPennsylvania Manufacturers\u2019 Association Casualty Insurance Company, a corporation, appellant, instituted this action in assumpsit against Fidelity and Deposit Company of Maryland, a corporation, and The Century Indemnity Insurance Company, a corporation, appellees, to recover unpaid premiums for a policy of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurance issued by it to Stewart Contracting Company. Suit was brought upon compliance and payment bonds, given to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, in which Stewart Contracting Company was principal and appellees were sureties. This appeal is from the decree of the court below sustaining affidavits of defense raising questions of law filed by both appellees challenging their liability under the respective bonds, and entry of judgment in their favor.\nStewart Contracting Company and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania entered into a contract for the improvement of a certain section of highway and bridges. The contract provided, inter alia, \u201cThe contractor shall accept, insofar as the work covered by the contract is concerned, the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of 1915, and any supplements or amendments thereto, and shall insure his liability thereunder or file with the Department of Highways a certificate of exemption from insurance . . .\u201d The contractor was to furnish to the Commonwealth two surety bonds \u2014 one \u201cto secure proper compliance with the terms and provisions of this contract\u201d, and another, \u201cfor the prompt payment in full of labor and material.\u201d Each appellee, as surety, executed the above-mentioned bonds which became a part of the contract between Stewart Contracting Company and the Commonwealth.\nThe compliance bonds provided that: \u201cif the above bounden principal as contractor shall in all respects comply with and perform the terms and conditions of said contract, and his, their, or its obligations thereunder, including the specifications therein referred to and made part thereof . . . then this obligation to be void or otherwise to be and remain in full force and virtue.\u201d The bonds for payment of labor and material provided that: \u201cif the above bounden principal shall and will promptly pay or cause to be paid in full all sums of money which may be due any person ... or corporation for all material furnished and labor supplied or performed in the prosecution of the work, whether or not-the said material or labor enter into and become component parts of the work or improvement contemplated, and for services rendered by public utilities in, or in connection with, the prosecution of such work, then this obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and effect.\u201d\nAppellant contends that: (1) the bonds, having been conditioned upon performance by the contractor of all the terms and conditions of the contract and performance of its obligations thereunder, inured to its benefit as the supplier of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurance; and (2) the services rendered by it as an insurance carrier were \u201cservices rendered by public utilities.\u201d\nThe court below properly held that the provisions of the several bonds could not reasonably be construed to include liability for the payment of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurance premiums. \u201cA bond given pursuant to a contract incorporated in the bond, will be construed in the light of the terms of the contract and the attendant circumstances, but The obligation of a bond cannot he extended beyond the plain import of the words used\u2019: Lancaster v. Frescoln, 192 Pa. 452, 457, 43 A. 961, 962; Erie v. Deifendorf, 278 Pa. 31, 122 A. 159\u201d; Fleck-Atlantic Company v. Indemnity Insurance Company of North America, 326 Pa. 15, 19, 191 A. 51, 53. Obligations not imposed by the terms of the bond cannot be created by judicial construction or interpretation which extends the terms beyond their normal meaning: City of Pittsburgh v. Parkview Construction Company, 344 Pa. 126, 23 A. (2d) 847, 848.\nThe compliance bonds in the instant case are conditioned on the contractor performing \u201cthe terms and conditions of said contract, and his, their, or its obligations thereunder.\u201d They do not contain any obligation to \u201csatisfy all claims and demands incurred in and for the same, or growing out of the same\u201d as did the bond in City of Pittsburgh v. Parkview Construction Company, supra. McFarland v. Rogers, 134 Me. 228, 184 A. 391, Building Contractors\u2019 Limited Mut. Liability Ins. Company v. Southern Surety Company, 185 Wis. 83, 200 N.W. 770, and Merchants Mutual Casualty Com pany v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. et al., 253 App. Div. 151, 2 N. Y. S. (2d) 370, relied upon by appellant, contained provisions similar to the bond in City of Pittsburgh v. Parkview Construction Company, supra. Payment of premiums for a policy of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Insurance was not an \u201cobligation\u201d assumed by appellees in their compliance bonds.\nAppellant contends that it, being an insurance carrier, performed \u201cservices rendered by public utilities\u201d and therefore, the provisions of the several payment bonds inure to its benefit. A reading of the bonds clearly shows that the parties never intended to so consider appellant. The court below aptly said: \u201cThe phrase Tor service rendered by public utilities\u2019 was obviously intended to cover facilities such as electricity, gas and telephones supplied by public utilities.\u201d This Court said, in City of Pittsburgh v. Parkview Construction Company, supra, \u201cThere is an abundance of authority to the effect that the payment of premiums for insurance policies does not fall within the obligation of such a bond.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed."}
