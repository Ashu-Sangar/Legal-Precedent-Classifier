{"id": "961082", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThese appeals are from orders dismissing exceptions to the report of viewers assessing benefits to pay for the costs and expenses of grading, paving and curbing a city street. The exceptions did not question the liability to assessment nor the regularity of the proceedings, nor the action of the viewers in any way except that they erred in judgment in determining the amount of benefits.\nThe appeals are dismissed and the orders are affirmed on the opinion of Judge Evans."}
