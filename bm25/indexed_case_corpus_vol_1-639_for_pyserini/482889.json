{"id": "482889", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nJONES, Chief Justice.\nAppellant, Jimmie Lee Lark, was convicted of murder in the second degree and aggravated robbery in the robbery-murder of Irving Rotfarb on September 3, 1970. Timely motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were denied and appellant was sentenced. This appeal followed.\nThe evidence adduced at trial disclosed that on the morning of September 3, 1970, the appellant, seventeen years old, and his adult brother, Nathaniel, observed the victim\u2019s automobile pull up to the residence of a neighbor, Gary Taylor, also known as Gary Bloch. Appellant asked Gary Taylor why the victim was at the residence and was told that the man cashed checks for Gary\u2019s mother. Appellant\u2019s brother, Nathaniel, said that they were going to \u201cget\u201d the victim. Appellant agreed to participate. He ran to the corner to act as a lookout for his brother. Nathaniel Lark approached the victim, shot and robbed him. The two boys ran home; on the way, appellant told a neighbor, Joseph Beard, that appellant and his brother robbed a man and that his brother had shot him. Inside the house Nathaniel gave the appellant thirty-five dollars out of an undetermined amount of money taken from the victim.\nAppellant assigns as error several matters, including the contention that the remarks of the prosecutor during his summation to the jury were so prejudicial as to require a new trial. We agree.\nThe prosecutor in his closing made the following 'remarks to the jury after each of which defense counsel interposed his objection and was overruled.\n\u201c . . . Remember we didn\u2019t come in here and wave any bloody shirts in front of your faces. We didn\u2019t bring in grieving widows or grandchildren. I mean, there was a man that died here. He had a family. He had people that loved him. He was 57 and working, maybe he was going to retire in a few years. I think there are other voices in this room. He may have said to you, I wanted to go on living. All right, I was 57, I had a family, grandchildren, but I wanted to live. I wanted to live with my family.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s how it all happens. That\u2019s right, he wasn\u2019t taken to the University of Pennsylvania, to the law library, and sat down there for tea. He wasn\u2019t taken to the home of the Bishop of Boston for a conference. It doesn\u2019t work that way, because the citizens have a right to be protected and they have a right to have these homicides that are occurring more and more solved.\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s eleven-thirty in the morning . can\u2019t you picture it, eleven-thirty in the morning on that street, there\u2019s all sorts of people there. Irving Rotfarb got killed. Could have been anybody. Could have been the next-door neighbors, anyone; people on the other side, next door. You never know what\u2019s going to happen in a felony murder and that\u2019s why the law makes good sense when it says if you believe it was a felony murder, or the defendant was the lookout, or they split the money afterwards, or he was part of the planning \u2014 and here\u2019s someone that fits into all three. And I think in terms of evilness Jimmie Lark is more evil than Nate Lark because when you blend it all together, I think he\u2019s actually the planner behind this, so that\u2019s why I say he\u2019s clever. That\u2019s for you to decide.\nI\u2019ll say for you there\u2019s one way that you could find this defendant not guilty, there\u2019s only one way, and that\u2019s if Irving Rotfarb walked through those courtroom doors, then you could find the defendant not guilty . . . .\u201d\nOn numerous occasions this Court has made explicitly clear its criticism of improper and prejudicial remarks on the part of a prosecutor. See Commonwealth v. Harvell, - Pa. -, 327 A.2d 27 (1974); Commonwealth v. Russell, 456 Pa. 559, 322 A.2d 127 (1974); Commonwealth v. Lipscomb, 455 Pa. 525, 317 A.2d 205 (1974); Commonwealth v. Brooks, 454 Pa. 75, 309 A.2d 732 (1973); Commonwealth v. Revty, 448 Pa. 512, 295 A.2d 300 (1972); Commonwealth v. Potter, 445 Pa. 284, 285 A.2d 492 (1971); Commonwealth v. Clark, 322 Pa. 321, 185 A. 764 (1936). We believe that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks in this case clearly exceeded the limits set forth in the cases above.\nReferences by the prosecutor such as those to bloody shirts, homicides that are occurring more and more and that it \u201ccould have been anybody\u201d were no more than ill-concealed attempts to divert the inquiry from the pursuit of truth and an invitation to give vent to visceral and unreasoned responses. See Commonwealth v. Harvell, \u2014 Pa. at -, 327 A.2d 27. We have said in regard to similar comment as to what the victim might say if he were alive, \u201cin testifying as if . . . Mr. Sweeney, was in the courtroom, that which followed amounted to the giving of testimony by an unsworn witness.\u201d Commonwealth v. Lipscomb, 455 Pa. at 528, 317 A.2d at 207. See also Commonwealth v. Clark, supra. Emphatically condemned in Lipscomb is yet another comment similar to that of the prosecutor when he argued here, \u201cthere\u2019s one way that you could find this defendant not guilty, there\u2019s only one way, and that\u2019s if Irving Rotfarb walked through those courtroom doors, then you could find the defendant not guilty.\u201d As we said in Lipscomb, 455 Pa. at 528-529, 317 A.2d at 207, this amounted to a statement by the prosecutor that he was personally convinced that the appellant was guilty, and his innocence was as unlikely as the deceased\u2019s resurrection. We held such personal assertions by the prosecutor on the guilt of the accused were beyond the scope of fair play and were reversible error.\nYet an even stronger assertion was made by the prosecutor in this case when he expressed his personal belief, after numerous references to the appellant\u2019s clever and cunning nature, that he thought Jimmie Lark to be clever, more evil than his brother and the actual planner of the crime committed by the two brothers. Not only did the prosecutor impermissibly express his personal conviction that appellant was guilty but he also characterized appellant as evil, clever and calculating. As was said in Commonwealth v. Capalla, 322 Pa. 200, 204, 185 A. 203 (1986), it is no part of the district attorney\u2019s duty nor right to stigmatize the defendant. The Capaila Court went on to say that the characterization of the defendant there as a cold-blooded killer was supported by no facts in the record which could warrant such a belief by anyone, and even if they were, the jury must be the first permitted to express such a belief. Here appellant, a juvenile who had never been in trouble before, agreed to run to the corner to be a lookout for a twenty-year old brother who had previously procured the murder weapon without any collaboration on the part of appellant, did the actual shooting and robbing of the victim and paid appellant afterwards for assisting him. The Commonwealth\u2019s strongest evidence of appellant\u2019s collaboration in the plan was appellant\u2019s own admission that the two brothers decided to rob the victim. For the district attorney to unfairly characterize appellant as he did, totally unsupported by any evidence in the record, was to express his own personal beliefs and to invite the jury to rely upon the district attorney\u2019s knowledge, general experience and wisdom. Cf., United States v. Schartner, 426 F.2d 470 (3d Cir. 1970). These statements exceeded the bounds of fair play and decency and violated the appellant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial.\nAppellant also seeks to have his confession suppressed. The only issue preserved for our consideration is the voluntariness of that confession. The trial court, supported by the record, found that appellant, seventeen years old and in the eleventh grade, was articulate, knowledgeable, of at least average intelligence, and capable of comprehending Miranda warnings. The trial court found that defendant was given his warnings, allowed to eat and to rest, and was in custody for approximately six hours prior to giving his first inculpatory statement. The court further found that appellant was not mistreated and that appellant\u2019s mother was aware that appellant was being taken in by the police for questioning but declined to accompany him. After examining the totality of the circumstances, the trial court correctly determined that the confession was voluntary. See Commonwealth v. Jones, 459 Pa. 286, 328 A.2d 828 (1974); Commonwealth v. Fogan, 449 Pa. 552, 558, 296 A.2d 755, 758 (1972); Commonwealth v. Moses, 446 Pa. 350, 287 A.2d 131 (1971).\nJudgment reversed and new trial ordered.\nROBERTS and MANDERINO, JJ., concur in the result.\n. The appeal of the judgment of sentence for the robbery conviction was filed in the Superior Court and subsequently transferred to this Court pursuant to the Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, \u00a7 503(c), 17P.S. \u00a7 211.503(c).\n. Since a new trial is mandated, we need not consider appellant\u2019s contentions that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting, over objection, certain leading questions by the Commonwealth of its own witnesses or that certain other remarks and conduct of the prosecutor were prejudicial.\n. See American Bar Associations Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function \u00a7\u00a7 5.8 and 5.9, recently set forth in Harvell, supra.\n. \u201cYou know, my best witness isn\u2019t here today. But if he could come back, if Mr. Sweeney could come back and sit in this chair and face you, the jury, I believe he would say, T didn\u2019t want to die. I was only 59 years of age. I think I had a number of years ahead of me, I didn\u2019t want to die. . . \u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Lipscomb, 455 Pa. at 526, 317 A.2d at 206.\n. \u201cAnd I think Mr. Sweeney would say, \u2018The only way you couldn\u2019t find this defendant guilty of murder of the first degree is for me to come alive again before your very eyes and walk out of that door to my home.\u2019 \u201d\nCommonwealth v. Lipscomb, 455 Pa. at 527, 317 A.2d at 206.\n. Appellant also raises on appeal the arguments that appellant was detained for an unreasonable length of time before being presented to a juvenile court judge and that Rule 318 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure, 19 P.S. Appendix, relating to the assignment of counsel, deprived appellant of equal protection of the law. Since neither of these arguments was raised until post-trial motions were filed, they were not timely presented for our consideration on this appeal."}
