Her last will and testament offered a' certain piece of real estate to the City of Philadelphia (City) \u201cfor a public park, on condition that no buildings shall be erected thereon other than those required for the\u2019 comfort of the people, and also that the garden and trees shall be preserved as far as possible. . . .\u201d The City accepted the land, now known as Howell Park, and.the.deed was duly recorded.\nNumerous surveys and studies had been made by the City to determine the best use to which the park could be devoted. Its small size, inaccessability and remoteness detracted from its development as a garden type park. In 1961, after further study and consultation with the residents in the area, the City concluded that the playing of Little League baseball was the best and most effective use which could be made of the area and that no other use for public park purposes was practical. The City then appropriated a sum of money for the construction of a Little League baseball field at Howell Park.\nAppellants, residents of the immediate vicinity, brought a bill in equity as taxpayers seeking an injunction against the City, the Department of Recreation and the Germantown Boys\u2019 Club which was to supervise the proposed field praying that the proposed use be restrained. The chancellor dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s bill. The court en banc dismissed appellants\u2019 excep: tions and entered a final decree in favor of the defendants.\n. Although there is some question in our minds as to. whether the appellants have standing to bring.. this-, taxpayers\u2019 suit attacking the use by the City of the. property in question, and to seek enforcement of the provisions of the Howell will, we shall not decide the appeal on either of these bases since our court, by the present procedure, has previously entertained appeals raising similar questions. Bernstein v. Pittsburgh, 366 Pa. 200, 77 A. 2d 452 (1951).\nThe sole question before us, therefore, is whether a Little League baseball field is a legal use of the land dedicated to the City by Miss Howell\u2019s will. We hold that it is.\nIt has been oft-repeated by our cases that a public park is a tract of ground kept more or less in its natural state, embellished by the planting of additional trees and flowers, and devoted to the purposes of pleasure, recreation and amusement. Bernstein v. Pittsburgh, supra at 206. Public parks have been recognized as the natural places for diversified athletic facilities. As we stated in Bernstein, supra, at 208: \u201c \u2018It is common knowledge that municipalities maintain public golf courses in their parks just as they maintain baseball diamonds, tennis courts, and playgrounds equipped with appropriate devices. . . .\u2019\u201d The fact that the proposed improvements will primarily benefit Little League baseball does not detract from the public nature of the use. It is not essential that the entire community, or even any considerable portion of it, should directly enjoy or participate in an improvement in order to make it a public one. Dornan v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, 331 Pa. 209, 222, 200 Atl. 834 (1938).\nUnder the City\u2019s proposed plan, over half of the area will remain grass and trees. Indeed, the City intends to so improve the property that more public use will be made of the garden type park facilities not used as a baseball field. This is in full compliance with the testatrix\u2019s expressed wish in her will that the garden and trees shall be preserved \u201cas far as possible.\u201d\nWe hold, therefore, that the lower court properly dismissed appellants\u2019 bill in equity.\nDecree affirmed at appellants\u2019 cost."}
