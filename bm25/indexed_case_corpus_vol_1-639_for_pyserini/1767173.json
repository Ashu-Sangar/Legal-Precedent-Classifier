{"id": "1767173", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM:\nThis matter comes before us on petitioner\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s order remanding for an evidentiary hearing on the question of whether or not the Commonwealth, at two prior hearings on Commonwealth\u2019s petitions for extension of time under Pa.R. Crim.P. 1100, had sufficient evidence to establish its \u201cdue diligence\u201d requirement under that rule, Commonwealth v. Akridge, 275 Pa.Super.-, 419 A.2d 18 (1980).\nIn our view, such a remand for a \u201csecond bite\u201d of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidentiary burden on the \u201cdue diligence\u201d requirement of Rule 1100 is in contradiction to the mandates we set forth in Commonwealth v. Ehredt, 485 Pa. 191, 401 A.2d 358 (1979).\nWe therefore grant the petition for allowance of appeal and reverse the order of the Superior Court with directions that petitioner be discharged.\nLARSEN, J., dissents."}
