{"id": "1893005", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThe question involved is narrow but important. Under the language of testatrix\u2019s will, were Pennsylvania Inheritance taxes and Federal Estate taxes on her jointly-owned property, payable out of her residuary estate or by the surviving co-tenant of the jointly-owned property? The lower Court held that none of these taxes were payable out of the residuary estate.\nKatherine G. Lander died on August 8, 1960, leaving a will dated February 14, 1956. Testatrix provided : \u201cFirst. I direct that all my just debts, funeral expenses, Federal Estate taxes and Pennsylvania Inheritance taxes be fully paid and satisfied by my Executors, as soon as conveniently may be, after my decease.\u201d\nTestatrix left personal property which was exclusively her own, amounting to approximately $50,000. She was also a joint tenant of certain personal property, which consisted almost entirely of shares of mutual funds, with a value of over $85,000, registered in the names of herself and (1) a son, and (2) a grandson, and (3) a granddaughter, and (4) a daughter-in-law, \u201cas joint tenants with right of survivorship.\u201d\nThe Pennsylvania Transfer Inheritance Tax Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 521, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a72301 et seq. (which is the pertinent statute), imposes a transfer inheritance tax upon the transfer by will or by the intestate laws of any property or of any interest therein from any person dying seized or possessed thereof, with certain exceptions not herein pertinent. It is usually denominated a legacy or succession tax on the privilege of receiving the property owned by a decedent: Pickering Estate, 410 Pa. 638, 190 A. 2d 132; Hoffmann Estate, 399 Pa. 96, 160 A. 2d 237; Wright Estate, 391 Pa. 405, 138 A. 2d 102; Shugars v. Chamberlain Amusements Enterprises, Inc., 284 Pa. 200, 130 Atl. 426; see also, Cochrane\u2019s Estate, 342 Pa. 108, 20 A. 2d 305. The tax is therefore payable by the recipient of the property unless the testatrix otherwise provides, expressly or by clear or necessary implication. Dravo Estate, 388 Pa. 551, 131 A. 2d 351; Spangenberg Estate, 359 Pa. 353, 59 A. 2d 103; Horn Estate, 351 Pa. 131, 40 A. 2d 471; Anderson\u2019s Estate, 312 Pa. 180, 167 Atl. 329.\nWe must therefore determine testatrix\u2019s intent, which is the polestar in the construction of this will and in the solution of the questions here involved. Houston Estate, 414 Pa. 579, 201 A. 2d 592; Burleigh Estate, 405 Pa. 373, 175 A. 2d 838; Dinkey Estate, 403 Pa. 179, 168 A. 2d 337.\nThe language of Mrs. Lander\u2019s will is a clear and express direction to her executor to pay all Federal Estate taxes and all Pennsylvania Inheritance taxes in full \u2014 and this direction clearly includes the Pennsylvania Inheritance taxes on her jointly-owned (extra-testamentary) property. To decide otherwise would be (a) to ignore the clear language of her will, or (b) to torture the language of her will into stating that the Pennsylvania Inheritance tax on jointly owned property \u2014 which never passed under or by virtue of her will and never was a part of her estate under the intestate laws \u2014 must be paid, not by her executors but by the surviving joint tenant. Cf. Cochrane\u2019s Estate, 342 Pa. supra; Horn Estate, 351 Pa. supra; Anderson\u2019s Estate, 312 Pa. supra; Spangenberg Estate, 359 Pa. supra.\nAnalogous cases confirm our construction.\nWe start with the general rule reiterated in Cochrane\u2019s Estate, 342 Pa. supra, that, absent any testamentary direction to the contrary, a personal representative is liable for the payment of the Pennsylvania Inheritance tax only upon such assets as pass through his hands. In that case, Chief Justice Schaffer, speaking for a unanimous Court, said (page 112) :\n\u201c. . . Who shall pay the tax depends upon who receives the property .... The only tax which is chargeable against the personal representative is that on the assets passing through its hands, which it is required to deduct from each distributive share. For the taw on the other assets of the estate, which do not pass through its hands, the Commonwealth must look to the individuals receiving the property.\u201d\nSee also to the same effect, Kritz Estate, 387 Pa. 223, 227, 127 A. 2d 720; Hunter\u2019s Pennsylvania Orphans\u2019 Court Commonplace Book, \u201cInheritance Tax,\u201d Section 10(c); Grossman & Smith\u2019s Pennsylvania Inheritance and Estate Tax, Section 741-1, p. 419.\nWhile precedents are usually of little value in the construction of a will, because the language in every will is almost always slightly or substantially different\u2014Henry Estate, 413 Pa. 478, 198 A. 2d 585; Burleigh Estate, 405 Pa. supra; Newlin Estate, 367 Pa. 527, 80 A. 2d 819\u2014the will in Horn Estate, 351 Pa. supra, is so very similar to Mrs. Lander\u2019s will that it confirms our interpretation and indeed is a controlling precedent. In Horn Estate, the Court said (pages 135, 136) :\n\u201c. . . [Mr. Horn\u2019s will provided] \u20181. I direct the payment of my just debts, the expense of probating my estate, and all inheritance and State taxes, as well as real estate, personal property taxes thereon, and all administration expenses, and all taxes of any character, to be paid out of my estate before the payment of the legacies and bequests and diveses [sic] hereinafter made.\u2019 Appellant contends that the word \u2018before\u2019 means \u2018prior in time\u2019, and hence the clause merely directs the executors to pay taxes before distribution as they are already required to do under the present law (Act of 1919, P. L. 521, amended by Act of 1923, P. L. 1078, 72 PS 2352; Act of 1937, P. L. 2762, 20 PS 844). Under appellant\u2019s view the effect is the same as though the paragraph had been omitted entirely from the will. Such interpretation is forced and unnatural. A will should be read in the ordinary and grammatical sense of the words employed: Bender v. Bender, 226 Pa. 607, 613, 75 A. 859; Long v. Stout, 305 Pa. 310, 316, 157 A. 607. A construction of a will which renders every word operative is to be preferred to one which makes some words and sentences idle and nugatory: Byrne\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 513, 519, 181 A. 500; Calder\u2019s Estate, 343 Pa. 30, 21 A. 2d 907 . . . the obvious meaning is that . . . \u2018the testatrix intended and directed that all transfer inheritance taxes and estate taxes upon all legacies and bequests should be paid out of the residuary estate by her executors.\u2019 \u201d\nPennsylvania Inheritance taxes and Federal Estate taxes are basically very different.\nIn Pickering Estate, 410 Pa., supra, the Court said (pages 646, 647) : \u201c. . . In Shugars v. Chamberlain Amusements Enterprises, Inc., 284 Pa. 200, supra, the Court said (page 205) : \u2018When the Commonwealth adopted an enlarged policy of taxation in 1917, a new class of property or rights was subjected to governmental burdens. Though commonly called a direct inheritance tax, yet, under the Act of 1919, the thing taxed was the right of succession [to] or the privilege of receiving at death the property possessed by a decedent either by will or under the intestate laws.\u2019\n\u201cSee to the same effect: Wright Estate, 391 Pa. 405, 138 A. 2d 102; Coxe\u2019s Estate, 181 Pa. 369, 37 A. 517; Van Beil\u2019s Estate, 257 Pa. 155, 101 A. 316; Knight\u2019s Estate, 261 Pa. 537, 104 A. 765.\n\u201cOn the other hand, it is well settled that the Federal Estate tax is not a legacy tax or a succession tax on the privilege of receiving the property possessed by a decedent; instead it is a tax on the privilege of transmission of decedent\u2019s property (i.e., the statutory net estate of the decedent), which is payable out of the estate as a whole: Biggs v. Del Drago, 317 U.S. 95; Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., 296 U.S. 39; Chase National Bank v. United States, 278 U.S. 327; Commissioner v. Clise, 122 F. 2d 998; Wright Estate, 391 Pa., supra.\n. It is \u201cdeath duties,\u201d as distinguished from a legacy or succession tax. It does not tax the interest to which the legatees and devisees succeed on death, but the interest which ceased by reason of death; what is imposed is an excise upon the transfer of an estate upon death of the owner, [citing U.S. cases] . . .\u2019 \u201d\nWith respect to Federal Estate taxes, the Internal Bevenue Code of 1954, \u00a72002, requires that all taxes which are imposed upon a decedent\u2019s statutory net estate shall be paid by the executor. There is no provision in that Act for apportionment. However, Pennsylvania\u2019s Estate Tax Apportionment Act of August 24, 1951, P. L. 1405, 20 P.S. \u00a7881 et seq., as amended, provides for an equitable apportionment of Federal Estate taxes, unless the testator expressly or by clear or necessary implication otherwise directs. Hoffmann Estate, 399 Pa., supra; Stadtfeld Estate, 359 Pa. 147, 58 A. 2d 478.\nWhen testatrix provided that \u201call my Federal Estate taxes and Pennsylvania Inheritance taxes be fully paid by my Executors,\u201d it is clear that she did not provide or intend one meaning and one plan for payment of Pennsylvania Inheritance taxes and a different meaning, plan and intent with respect to payment of Federal Estate taxes. When, as we have seen, she clearly intended Tier executors and not the survivor of her jointly-owned (extra-testamentary) property to pay the Pennsylvania Inheritance taxes thereon in full, it is unreasonable and under her language impossible to find that she intended the survivor of said jointly-owned property to pay the Federal Estate taxes thereon.\nOrder reversed, and case remanded for disposition in accordance with this Opinion; costs to be paid by appellee.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nUnder the Act of June 15, 1961, P. L. 373, \u00a7718; Act of July 26, 1963, P. L. 325, \u00a72, 72 PS \u00a72485-718, it is provided, with certain exceptions not here pertinent, that the inheritance tax upon the transfer of property which passes by will and certain other transfers, is payable out of the residuary estate, in the absence of a contrary intent appearing in the will (or in other instruments of transfer)."}
