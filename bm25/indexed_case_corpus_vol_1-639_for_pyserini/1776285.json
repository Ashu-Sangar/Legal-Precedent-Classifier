{"id": "1776285", "contents": "OPINION\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is an action in trespass filed by the administratrix of the estate of James Sherk against appellant-defendant Daisy-Heddon in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County on counts of strict liability, Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A, misrepresentation, Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402B, and negligence. The administratrix, the appellee on this appeal, seeks damages for the death of James Sherk, who died after having been struck in the head by a \u201cB-B\u201d fired from a Daisy Power King Model 880 pump-up air rifle by Robert Saenz, a friend of the decedent. At trial appellee proceeded against appellant on the theory that appellant, the manufacturer of the air rifle, had failed to provide an adequate warning of the rifle\u2019s lethal propensity and that the alleged failure to warn of the lethal propensity of the air rifle had caused James Sherk\u2019s death. At the close of the evidence, the trial court submitted the case to the jury with instructions on the count of strict liability, but denied appellee\u2019s request that the jury be instructed on the counts of misrepresentation and negligence.\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of appellant, but on appeal a panel of the Superior Court (Lipez, J., dissenting) reversed the judgment entered upon the verdict and remanded for a new trial. 285 Pa.Super. 320, 427 A.2d 657 (1981). The Superior Court upheld the trial court\u2019s refusal to submit the count of misrepresentation to the jury, but deemed a new trial to be necessary because, in its view, the trial court had improperly refused to charge the jury on negligence and had erroneously excluded evidence of the \u201ccommunity\u2019s perception\u201d that BB guns previously marketed by appellant had been non-lethal.\nBecause the evidence presented at trial, including plaintiff-appellee\u2019s own evidence, precluded a finding that the allegedly inadequate warnings accompanying the Power King air rifle caused James Sherk\u2019s death, we conclude that the Superior Court erred in disturbing the judgment of the trial court. Hence, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and reinstate the judgment entered upon the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of appellant.\nI\nWhile the Superior Court properly held that a plaintiff may proceed on theories of both negligence and strict liability, see Kuisis v. Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., 457 Pa. 321, 319 A.2d 914 (1974), it erroneously concluded that the trial court\u2019s failure to charge on negligence or to admit the challenged evidence requires a new trial. Liability in negligence or strict liability is not imposed upon a manufacturer simply for the manufacture of a defective product. Rather, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the injuries sustained were proximately caused by the product\u2019s defect. See Azzarello v. Black Bros. Co., 480 Pa. 547, 391 A.2d 1020 (1978); Berkebile v. Brantley Helicopter Corp., 462 Pa. 83, 337 A.2d 893 (1975). See also Kuisis v. Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton Corp., supra. The claimed \u201cdefect\u201d in the Daisy Power King Model 880 pump-up air rifle was the alleged failure on the part of appellant Daisy-Heddon to provide an adequate warning of the Power King\u2019s lethal propensity. Although appellee proceeded on the theory that if the lethal propensity had been known, Robert Saenz would never have directed the Power King at James Sherk\u2019s head, appellee\u2019s proof established facts from which it must be concluded that Robert Saenz was legally chargeable with knowledge of the Power King\u2019s lethal propensity.\nRobert Saenz, who was fourteen years old on the day of the shooting, testified that on that day he and James Sherk had been firing the Power King at glass bottles and tin cans from a distance of fifteen to twenty feet. Robert Saenz was aware that \u201cdepending] on how many times you pumped [the rifle] up,\u201d the BBs fired from the rifle could shatter the bottles and pierce through the cans. He also testified that he had known that the air rifle was \u201csome[what more] powerful\u201d than the spring BB guns he had previously used. Moreover, he knew that a BB fired from the Power King could blind a person and that he should never point a gun at anyone. Indeed, Robert Saenz testified that he had expected to use the Power King to kill rabbits and rats. He had been told by his father and mother not to use the Power King until his father had instructed him in its use. On the day of the shooting, Robert Saenz used the gun without permission and without having read the instructions accompanying the Power King.\nRobert Saenz was familiar with the operation of the Power King. He knew that in order for air to be pumped into the rifle, the bolt had to be opened and the manual safety device had to be pushed to the \u201con\u201d position, in which position the red mark indicating that the rifle was ready to fire would not be visible. He also knew that the trigger would not fire the rifle when the bolt was open or when the safety was pushed to the \u201con\u201d position. Robert Saenz admitted that, when he had directed the Power King at the decedent, he knew that the Power King had been pumped with air. He testified that he \u201cjust didn\u2019t bother\u201d to check the position of the safety device. Instead, he pushed the safety device and \u201cjust assumed that it went on safe.\u201d In fact, he had pushed the safety from the \u201con\u201d to the \u201coff\u201d position, thereby enabling the rifle to fire.\nRobert Saenz testified that he had stood five feet from the decedent, who was sitting on the ground, and that he had pointed the barrel of the Power King at the decedent\u2019s head. He testified that he had \u201ccalled Jimmy\u2019s name,\u201d intending that James Sherk would turn and look at him, and then \u201csqueezed the trigger, thinking the safety was on.\u201d Robert Saenz further testified, \u201cI was just horsing around, intended to scare him. I was just fooling around.\u201d He said that, when he directed the rifle at James Sherk\u2019s head, he knew that \u201cthis was something that [he] shouldn\u2019t be doing\u201d and \u201cthis was something that could injure [his] friend.\u201d\nThis evidence makes it clear that the Power King air rifle was misused by Robert Saenz in a manner that Robert Saenz knew could cause serious bodily injury. Despite his knowledge that BBs fired from the Power King could kill animals and blind a person, Robert Saenz directed the Power King from close range at James Sherk\u2019s head.\nWhere, as here, the lethal propensity of a gun was known or should have been known to the user, liability cannot be imposed upon the manufacturer merely because the manufacturer allegedly has failed to warn of that propensity. As stated by Dean Prosser,\n\u201c[t]here appears to be no reason to doubt that strict liability has made no change in the rule, well settled in the negligence cases, that the seller of the product is not to be held liable when the consumer makes an abnormal use of it. Sometimes this has been put on the ground that the manufacturer has assumed responsibility only for normal uses; sometimes it has gone off on \u2018proximate cause.\u2019 \u201d\nProsser, The Fall of the Citadel, 50 Minn.L.Rev. 791, 824 (1966) (footnote omitted). See Salvador v. Atlantic Steel Boiler Co., 457 Pa. 24, 32, 319 A.2d 903, 907 (1974) (\u201ca manufacturer by marketing and advertising his product impliedly represents that it is safe for its intended use\u201d); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A comment h (1965) (\u201cA product is not in a defective condition when it is safe for normal handling and consumption.\u201d). Thus, because this record demonstrates that Robert Saenz is legally chargeable with sufficient appreciation of the nature of the risk of his misuse of the Power King, he is exclusively responsible for the consequences of his misuse.\nII\nAppellee cannot prevail on the theory that if the parents of Robert Saenz had known of the Power King\u2019s lethal propensity, they would not have permitted Robert Saenz to have possession of the Power King and thus be in a position to misuse it. The Power King was purchased by Mrs. Saenz from a mail order catalogue at the request of Robert and his older brother Wayne. Mrs. Saenz testified that she had \u201cno knowledge of guns,\u201d and did not know \u201cwhat BB guns look like.\u201d She purchased the Power King air rifle without consulting or informing her husband, at a time when her son Wayne \u201cjust hit [her] at the right moment with the proper approach.\u201d When the rifle arrived in the mail, Mrs. Saenz did not open the box or read the instructions. Instead, the box \u201cwas put away,\u201d and Mrs. Saenz directed her sons that the gun was not to be used until their father had instructed them in its use. Later that week, Mr. Saenz looked at the gun but did not read the operation and instruction manuals accompanying the Power King. Mr. Saenz testified that he had told Robert not to point the gun at anyone and not to use the gun until he had been instructed by him in its use. Mr. Saenz had intended to read the instructions and to instruct his children in the use of the gun on the upcoming Saturday, the day that the shooting took place.\nIn Ucci v. Keane, 402 Pa. 467, 167 A.2d 147 (1961), this Court stated:\n\u201c[I]t is well established that \u2018Proof of injury alone, without more, or of the existence of the negligent condition without showing that it caused the injury complained of, is insufficient to establish a case of liability.\u2019 Burns v. City of Pittsburgh, 320 Pa. 92, 94, 181 Atl. 487 (1935). It is not enough that a defect exist which could not, even conceivably, have caused the accident. \u2018Proving that an accident happened, or the existence of an opportunity for it to happen in the manner alleged, is entirely insufficient to establish negligence: Stern v. Reading, 255 Pa. 96, 99 Atl. 367 (1916). Plaintiff must go further and show not only defendant\u2019s negligence, but that the injuries complained of were the result of such negligence.\u2019: Houston v. Rep.Ath.Assn., 343 Pa. 218, 220, 22 A.2d 715 (1941).\u201d\nId., 402 Pa. at 471-72, 167 A.2d at 150. On this record it is clear that the alleged \u201cdefect\u201d in the warnings accompanying the Power King air rifle did not cause James Sherk\u2019s death. Robert Saenz had possession of the Power King only because he had disobeyed his parents\u2019 directions not to use the rifle. Notwithstanding his own knowledge of the Power King\u2019s lethal propensity, his knowledge that the rifle should never be pointed at anyone, and his failure to check the position of the safety mechanism, he directed the Power King from close range at James Sherk\u2019s head. As this record establishes that James Sherk\u2019s death did not result from the allegedly inadequate warnings accompanying the Power King, appellant was entitled to a verdict in its favor on all counts.\nIll\nBecause the evidence refutes appellee\u2019s contention that James Sherk\u2019s death was caused by the allegedly inadequate warnings accompanying the Power King, the exclusion of evidence regarding the \u201ccommunity\u2019s perception\u201d of BB guns other than the Power King air rifle marketed under the Daisy trademark did not adversely affect appellee\u2019s case. Thus, it is unnecessary to address the question of the admissibility of evidence of the \u201ccommunity\u2019s perception\u201d of a manufacturer\u2019s products. Cf. Ucci v. Keane, supra, 402 Pa. at 472-73, 167 A.2d at 150 (plaintiff\u2019s failure to show \u201cproximate cause as between the alleged negligence and the injuries sustained,\u201d makes it \u201cunnecessary to discuss the standard and degree of care owing from the seller of goods to a foreseeable user\u201d).\nOrder of the Superior Court reversed. Judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County entered upon the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of appellant reinstated.\nFLAHERTY, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nHUTCHINSON, J., joins in this opinion and files a concurring opinion.\nMcDERMOTT, J., concurs in the result.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion in which O\u2019BRIEN, C. J., joins.\n. No appeal has been taken from this aspect of the Superior Court\u2019s ruling.\n. Plaintiff had sought to demonstrate through the excluded evidence that the lethal propensity of the Daisy Power King air rifle would not generally have been known by the public without a warning to that effect. See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A comment j (1965) (warning not required \u201cwhen the danger, or potentiality of danger, is generally known and recognized\u201d). The excluded evidence included advertisements of Daisy products other than the Power King that had not been seen by Robert Saenz or his parents.\nPlaintiff did establish the non-lethal propensity of previously marketed Daisy products through the testimony of the Director of Product Evaluation and the Director of Research and Development for Daisy-Heddon.\n. This case was reassigned to this writer on June 28, 1982.\nRobert Saenz testified on behalf of plaintiff-appellee, as did his parents, June and Michael Saenz. Both Robert Saenz and his parents were also additional defendants, having been joined by appellant. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of Mr. and Mrs. Saenz and the jury returned a verdict in favor of Robert Saenz along with its verdict in favor of appellant. The parties do not challenge the determinations relating to Robert Saenz and his parents.\n. The evidence also establishes that on two other days during the week of the shooting Robert Saenz had used the Power King without his parents\u2019 permission.\n. The operation and instruction manuals accompanying the Power King were introduced into evidence. The cover of the operation manual stated: \u201cBuilt for greater power \u2014 much more powerful than other non-powder guns.\u201d The text of the operation manual further stated:\n\u201cThe Pump-Up Air Gun is a new, much more powerful type gun than the traditional Daisy spring-air B* B gun. It shoots with four to six times the power of the spring-air B\u00bbB gun and must be treated with great care and respect.\nALWAYS HANDLE A GUN AS IF IT WERE LOADED. \u2018Handling\u2019 means every time you touch your gun. It also means you must never point your gun toward any living thing nor at any part of your own body nor at anything that could be damaged by an accidental shot.\nThe more you pump your Daisy, the higher the velocity of the B*B or pellet when it is fired. Two or three pumps are recommended for indoor target shooting. Higher velocity for outdoor shooting can be achieved by pumping the gun up to ten strokes.\nCAUTION: Due to the additional power of the Pump-up Air Gun, extra precaution is required in selecting a safe target. You must pick a target that cannot be penetrated or cause a ricochet. Spring-air B *B gun targets are not considered a safe target for the Pump-up Air Gun. Hard surfaces will cause a ricochet.\u201d\nThe instruction manual also stated:\n\u201cNever point a gun at anyone. Never point a gun at anything you do not want to shoot. Never point your Daisy at any living thing.\u201d\nMr. Saenz testified that, had he read these allegedly inadequate instructions, the instructions would \u201chave made a difference to him.\u201d He testified that he would have learned of the Power King\u2019s \u201caccuracy and velocity\u201d and \u201cwould have never let them use it, period. I would have sent it back.\u201d\nRobert Saenz testified that he, too, had not read the allegedly inadequate instructions accompanying the Power King: \u201cI was just too eager to take it out, that\u2019s all.\u201d"}
