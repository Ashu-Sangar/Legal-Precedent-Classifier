{"id": "582242", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThe sole issue is the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s confession. The record does not indicate that the confession was other than \u201cthe product of a rational intellect and free will.\u201d Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 207-08, 80 S. Ct. 274, 280-81 (1960); Commonwealth v. Hallowell, 444 Pa. 221, 225-26, 282 A.2d 327, 329 (1971); see Davis v. North Carolina, 384 U.S. 737, 86 S. Ct. 1761 (1966); Commonwealth v. Eiland, 450 Pa. 566, 301 A.2d 651 (1973); Commonwealth v. Holton, 432 Pa. 11, 247 A.2d 228 (1968).\nAdmission of the confession at trial was thus proper. On this record, there is no basis for disturbing the jury\u2019s verdict of voluntary manslaughter.\nThe judgment of sentence is affirmed."}
