{"id": "981793", "contents": "Pee Ctjeiam,\nThe learned judge of the court below held that the affidavit of defence was sufficient to prevent judgment. In this we think he was right. The case comes directly within the ruling in Schroeder v. Galland, 134 Pa. 277. Indeed, the contract appears to have been drawn with reference to that decision, as its language is identical with the opinion of Mr. Justice G reen. We adhere to the law of that case. It follows that the judgment of the court below must be affirmed."}
