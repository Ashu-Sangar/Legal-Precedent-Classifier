{"id": "848163", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis case involved questions of fact which were clearly for the consideration of the jury, and hence defendant company\u2019s request for binding instructions in its favor was rightly refused. The offer of evidence recited in the second specification was rightly excluded.\nThe subjects of complaint in the third, fourth, fifth and sixth specifications are portions of the learned judge\u2019s charge recited therein respectively. There appears to be no error in either of these of which the defendant company has any just reason to complain. The contract\u2019 obligation into which it entered, by accepting the ordinance of the borough, was rightly construed by the court. Neither of the specifications of error is sustained.\nJudgment affirmed."}
