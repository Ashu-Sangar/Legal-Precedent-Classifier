{"id": "4081669", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice BAER.\nGeorge William Yohe, II, (Appellant) appeals from the Superior Court order that reversed the trial court\u2019s order awarding a new trial on the ground that his constitutional right of confrontation was violated. We agree with the Superior Court that Appellant\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation was not violated at trial because the testifying witness was not a \u201csurrogate witness,\u201d as Appellant argues. Rather, as discussed below, the witness was the author of the testimonial statement offered into evidence and, therefore, was an appropriate witness under the Confrontation Clause. Accordingly, Appellant\u2019s confrontation rights were protected by this testimony, and we affirm.\nOn August 19, 2009, Officer Scott George performed a traffic stop of Appellant\u2019s vehicle because of its faulty license plate and brake lights. During the course of the stop, the officer observed signs of alcohol consumption, and arrested Appellant for Driving Under the Influence of alcohol (DUI). Officer George transported Appellant to Memorial Hospital where a phlebotomist drew a blood sample and prepared it for shipment to National Medical Services Labs (NMS Labs) for chemical analysis.\nNMS Labs received Appellant\u2019s blood sample on August 21, 2009. An employee examined it for proper seal, label, and volume, logged receipt of the sample, and placed it in a secured bin. It is the routine practice of NMS Labs to test blood samples for alcohol content by removing three small portions (referred to as \u201caliquots\u201d) from the blood sample and to conduct three distinct tests, using two testing methods, to determine alcohol content. One method of testing is gas chromatography, and the second is enzymatic assay, both of which determine the quantity of alcohol in the blood. It is the practice of NMS Labs routinely to test a blood sample for alcohol content twice using gas chromatography, and once using enzymatic assay.\nIn accord with this practice, NMS Labs conducted the three tests on Appellant\u2019s blood sample. First, NMS Labs\u2019 employee Megan Silcox retrieved the blood sample from storage, extracted an aliquot for testing, returned the balance of the sample to storage, and tested the aliquot for alcohol content using enzymatic assay. Next, another employee, Lisa Chacko, retrieved the blood sample from storage, extracted two more aliquots for testing, and returned the remaining sample to storage. She tested the aliquots for alcohol content twice, utilizing gas chromatography.\nDr. Lee Blum is Assistant Laboratory Director and a toxicologist at NMS Labs. As Assistant Lab Director, he is responsible for the lab\u2019s quality assurance program and client service. As a forensic toxicologist, he is involved in reviewing analytical testing, report writing, and testifying at trials. In this role, he receives the raw data that resulted from the three blood tests, checks the demographic information on the testing data, evaluates the chain of custody, and verifies that the lab technicians performed the appropriate testing.\nTurning to the results from the three tests NMS generally conducts, Dr. Blum\u2019s practice is to examine the results of the duplicate gas chromatography tests to determine if they validate each other by being within certain parameters, and, taking into account the appropriate margins of error, compare those test results to the results of the enzymatic assay test. If the test results are in accord, he will report the lower of the two gas chromatograph test results as the blood alcohol content (BAC) in accord with NMS Labs protocol.\nAfter conducting this case review, Dr. Blum affixes his electronic signature to the Toxicology Report, which is a three page document summarizing the tests that were performed and the results therefrom, and certifies its contents. In addition to reporting the BAC, the Toxicology Report includes a certification that Dr. Blum \u201cdirectly participated in the determination of the results by reviewing and certifying that the analytical data including internal standards and calculations utilized in reporting the results of this case are accurate and correct,\u201d and that Dr. Blum will be available to testify in court.\nIn this case, following laboratory procedure as outlined above, Dr. Blum reviewed Appellant\u2019s case file. The enzymatic assay test indicated Appellant\u2019s BAC was .175%, and the two gas chromatograph tests indicated it was .159% and .161%, respectively. Dr. Blum analyzed the data in the case file and electronically signed the Toxicology Report indicating Appellant\u2019s BAC was .159%, the lower of the gas chromatograph results.\nAt Appellant\u2019s August 30, 2010, non jury trial, the Commonwealth introduced into evidence the Toxicology Report indicating that Appellant\u2019s BAC was .159% through the expert testimony of Dr. Blum. Appellant objected to Dr. Blum\u2019s testimony regarding the Toxicology Report, and to the admission of the Toxicology Report, on the grounds that it violated his right to confrontation guaranteed by the 6th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution because the specific lab technicians who performed the testing of Appellant\u2019s blood sample were not called as witnesses. The trial court overruled these objections.\nDr. Blum testified that, consistent with lab policy, on August 31,2009, he reviewed Appellant\u2019s case file, which included the raw analytical data for the duplicate gas chromatography and enzymatic assay tests. He explained that the reason the lab employs tests on two types of machines is to ensure the accuracy of the result identified in the Toxicology Report: relying on two kinds of physical chemical analysis, performed by two different individuals, at two different times, confirms the verity of the test results.\nWith regard to Appellant\u2019s blood sample in particular, Dr. Blum testified that it was tested in duplicate through gas chromatography, producing values of .159% and .161 %. The enzymatic assay produced a value of .175%. Dr. Blum considered these numbers to verify each other because they were within a certain percentage, recorded the lowest of these results in the Toxicology Report, and signed the report. He testified to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty that Appellant\u2019s BAC was, as reflected in the Report, .159%.\nOn cross-examination, counsel questioned Dr. Blum about the chain of custody and the types of tubes used to contain Appellant\u2019s blood. Dr. Blum acknowledged that he did not observe either Ms. Silcox or Ms. Chacko take the aliquots from the blood sample or test the aliquots, and, indeed, did not personally handle the aliquots or the blood sample; rather, he reviewed all documentation in the file associated with the specimen.\nAfter the Commonwealth rested its case, Appellant moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing that Dr. Blum\u2019s testimony was insufficient to satisfy the Confrontation Clause because he did not personally test Appellant\u2019s blood. The trial court denied the motion, and Appellant presented his defense. The trial ultimately court found Appellant guilty on August 30, 2010, of DUI.,\nFollowing sentencing, Appellant filed a post-sentence motion reasserting his objection to the admission of Dr. Blum\u2019s testimony and the Toxicology Report on confrontation grounds, arguing that the Toxicology Report should not have been admitted without accompanying testimony by the toxicologists who performed the blood tests. On January 13, 2011, the trial court granted Appellant\u2019s post-sentence motion and granted a new trial, holding that the Toxicology Report was improperly admitted at trial because \u201can analyst who performed the tests did not testify.\u201d Trial Ct. Op, May 5, 2011, p. 1.\nThe trial court reached its conclusion by first finding that the Toxicology Report was a testimonial statement because it was compiled for the express purpose of being used at trial and was admitted into evidence. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) (defining testimonial statements as, inter alia, \u201cex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent,\u201d including affidavits \u201cor similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially ... \u201d). The trial court held, therefore, that the Toxicology Report was inadmissible without the testimony of the declarant. See id. (holding that a witness\u2019s testimony against a defendant is inadmissible unless the witness appears at trial or, if the witness is unavailable, the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination).\nNext, the trial court held that the declarant whose testimony was required at trial was the \u201canalyst who actually performed the analysis on [Appellant\u2019s] blood sample.\u201d Trial Ct. Op., May 5, 2011, p. 3. In this regard, the trial court relied on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009) and the Superior Court case Commonwealth v. Barton-Martin, 5 A.3d 363 (Pa.Super.2010). In Melendez-Diaz, the prosecution proffered \u201ccertificates of analysis\u201d identifying material seized from the defendant as drugs, which were sworn to by the analysts who ran the tests, without offering any witnesses in support of the certificates. 557 U.S. at 308, 129 S.Ct. 2527. The defendant objected, arguing that he had a constitutional right to confront the analysts, who should have been required to testify. Id. at 309, 129 S.Ct. 2527. The Supreme Court determined that the certificates were affidavits prepared under circumstances leading a reasonable person to believe they would be used at trial, and, accordingly, were testimonial. Id. at 310, 129 S.Ct. 2527. Consequently, the analysts who prepared the certificates were \u201cwitnesses\u201d for purposes of the Sixth Amendment whom the defendant had a right to confront. Id. at 331, 129 S.Ct. 2527. Because this right was not afforded, the certificates were deemed inadmissible. Id.\nIn Barton-Martin, the defendant objected to admission of a blood alcohol lab report without the testimony of the laboratory technician who performed the test and prepared the report. 5 A.3d at 365. The Commonwealth had presented the testimony of a witness who was the laboratory administrative director and custodian of records for the hospital where the analysis was performed. Id. at 366. Although the witness testified about lab procedures generally, she had not analyzed the defendant\u2019s blood or the results of the blood tests. Id. The trial court admitted the report, but the Superior Court reversed, holding the blood alcohol report was the type of ex parte out-of-court statement that was inadmissible without an opportunity for confrontation pursuant to Melendez-Diaz. Id. at 368. The court held that absent a showing that the laboratory technician who ran the test and authored the report was unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination, \u201cthe laboratory technician\u2019s failure to testify in the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief violated [the defendant\u2019s] Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.\u201d Id. at 369. The testimony of the custodian of records, unconnected to the performance of the analysis at issue, did not satisfy the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. Id.\nConsidering Melendez-Diaz and Barton-Martin, the trial court here reasoned that Dr. Blum\u2019s testimony was insufficient because he neither tested the aliquots nor observed the testing, and Appellant\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Blum was limited in ways that cross-examination of the analyst who performed the test would not have been: \u201cWhile credibility of the analyst is certainly an issue, it is not the sole reason for requiring that he or she be subject to confrontation; the manner of testing requires some exercise of judgment, which presents a risk of error that could be addressed on cross-examination.\u201d Trial Ct. Op., May 5,2011, p. 3-4.\nThe Commonwealth appealed to the Superior Court, arguing that because Dr. Blum was the analyst who derived the numerical conclusion of Appellant\u2019s BAC, his testimony regarding the Toxicology Report satisfied Appellant\u2019s right of confrontation under the Sixth Amendment. Commonwealth v. Yohe, 39 A.3d 381 (Pa.Super.2012). The Superior Court agreed, concluding that the trial court erred in determining Appellant was entitled to a new trial, and reversed. Id. The Superior Court observed that after Melendez-Diaz and subsequent to Appellant\u2019s trial, the United States Supreme Court addressed a scenario similar to that presented in Barton-Martin in Bullcoming v. New Mexico, \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2705, 180 L.Ed.2d 610 (2011).\nIn Bullcoming, the defendant was charged with driving while intoxicated, and, at his subsequent trial, the laboratory report of his BAC was offered into evidence. Id. at 2709. The report was completed, signed, and certified by an analyst who was not called to testify. Id. at 2711-12. Instead, the prosecutor called as a witness another analyst from the same lab to testify generally about lab procedures and equipment. Id. at 2712. The Supreme Court initially, again, reiterated that \u201c[a]n analyst\u2019s certification prepared in connection with a criminal investigation or prosecution\u201d is testimonial, and is therefore subject to the requirements of the Confrontation Clause, id. at 2713-14 (citing Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 318-21, 129 S.Ct. 2527), and that an out-of-court testimonial statement \u201cmay not be introduced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to confront that witness.\u201d Id. at 2713.\nBecause the trial court had \u201cpermitted the testimonial statement of one witness ... to enter into evidence through the in-court testimony of a second person ...,\u201d the High Court reversed. Id. The Court specifically disapproved of such \u201csurrogate testimony,\u201d which could not have conveyed \u201cwhat [the certifying analyst] knew or observed about the events his certification concerned, i.e., the particular test and testing process he employed,\u201d nor would it \u201cexpose any lapses or lies on the certifying analyst\u2019s part.\u201d Id. at 2715. The Court concluded that the reliability of the certifying analyst or the testing procedure conducted was irrelevant to the constitutional question:\n... [T]he comparative reliability of an analyst\u2019s testimonial report drawn from machine-produced data does not overcome the Sixth Amendment bar. This Court settled in Crawford that the \u201cobviou[s] reliability]\u201d of a testimonial statement does not dispense with the Confrontation Clause. Accordingly, the analysts who write reports that the prosecution introduces must be made available for confrontation even if they possess \u201cthe scientific acumen of Mme. Curie and the veracity of Mother Teresa.\u201d\nId. (quoting Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 319, n. 6, 129 S.Ct. 2527).\nConsidering this precedent, the Superior Court in this case held that the factual circumstances presented herein are distinct from the precedent discussed above because the testifying witness, Dr. Blum, reviewed the entire file, compared the results of three independent test printouts on three aliquots, certified the accuracy of the results, and signed the report. Yoke, 39 A.3d at 388. In this regard, the Superior Court agreed with the Commonwealth that even though he did not observe, prepare, or conduct the actual testing, \u201cDr. Blum was the \u2018analyst\u2019 or the person who reviewed the raw data from the machines and generated an expert report based on his review of the raw data that was generated. Therefore, Dr. Blum is the witness that [Appellant] had a right to confront.\u201d Id. at 389.\nOn appeal, Appellant argues that this case is factually identical to Barton-Martin and Bullcoming because Dr. Blum did not personally handle Appellant\u2019s blood sample, prepare the aliquots, or place the aliquots into the testing apparatuses. Although Barton-Martin is not binding on this Court, Appellant asserts that the Superior Court in that case reached a constitutionally mandated result by disapproving of the testimony of anyone other than the analyst who conducted the blood alcohol test. See Barton-Martin, 5 A.3d at 365 (\u201cBecause the Commonwealth did not summon at trial the analyst who prepared Appellant\u2019s lab report, we conclude that Appellant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause were violated and that the lab report showing her blood-alcohol content was inadmissible.\u201d). Similarly, Appellant argues that the Superior Court opinion in the case now before us is directly contrary to Bullcoming, which he interprets as requiring the analyst who ran the blood tests to be made available for confrontation. 131 S.Ct. at 2715 (\u201cthe analysts who write reports that the prosecution introduces must be made available for confrontation ...\u201d).\nAppellant asserts that the distinguishing facts on which the Superior Court relied (Dr. Blum\u2019s review of the test results and certification of the Toxicology Report) are factually incorrect. According to Appellant, Dr. Blum was a surrogate witness because he merely reviewed the testing results committed to paper by the analysts and vouched for their validity. Although Dr. Blum could answer questions about laboratory protocols, he could not, according to Appellant, answer questions related to how the data contained in the report was generated, or address how the samples were handled, the process of placing the samples in the machines, or the retrieval of the samples following testing.\nAppellant argues that requiring the analyst who conducted the relevant testing to testify serves four fundamental purposes: it enables meaningful cross-examination of what the analyst has done; it guarantees that the analyst who generated the testimonial statements is questioned under oath and subject to the penalties of perjury; it allows the fact-finder to observe that witness\u2019s demeanor and her responses to questions; and it ensures that the accuser face the accused. Appellant asserts that permitting the testimony of a surrogate witness renders it impossible to determine whether the analyst was fraudulent or incompetent. In this regard, Appellant asserts that conducting gas chromatography testing is a skill which the U.S. Supreme Court discussed in Bullcoming as being dependent on good analytical practices and an analyst who is aware of what is being done and why. Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2711, n. 1.\nThe Pennsylvania Association of Drunk Driving Defense Attorneys (PADDDA) has filed an amicus curiae brief on behalf of Appellant detailing forensic laboratory scandals that have resulted from falsified results, a lack of oversight, and the absence of quality controls, and which were not detected under the safeguards that had been in place. Considering these scandals, PADDDA posits that allowing defendants to cross-examine the person who conducted the lab test, rather than the supervisor who viewed the test results, will permit them adequately to defend themselves at trial and will operate as oversight of the lab. According to PADDDA, each of the numerous lab scandals it details in its brief ultimately came to light by cross-examination of the lab analyst by counsel for the accused. Similarly, the Pennsylvania Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers argues as amicus that a meaningful opportunity for cross-examination must be available in all trials involving laboratory test results, and defines the opportunity as meaningful only when the witness had an active role in the testing.\nThe National Conference for DUI Defense Attorneys have also filed an amicus curiae, brief in support of Appellant, detailing the process of gas chromatography, and articulating that it is highly technical, complicated, and vulnerable to the possibility of error or fraud, including the ability surreptitiously to manipulate the data, and arguing that this Court should therefore hold that only the opportunity to cross-examine the analyst who ran the test satisfies the Confrontation Clause.\nThe Commonwealth responds that the testimonial statement in this case, in accord with Crawford, is, as the lower courts found, the Toxicology Report, which concludes that Appellant\u2019s blood alcohol content was .159%. The Commonwealth considers Dr. Blum to be the author and signatory of the testimonial statement, and, therefore, the requisite witness pursuant to the Confrontation Clause in accord with Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct. 2527, Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. 2705, and Williams v. Illinois, \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2221, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012) (plurality). Williams, which was decided after the Superior Court decided Appellant\u2019s appeal and will be discussed below, is the third United States Supreme Court decision on the Confrontation Clause as it pertains to scientific reports. The Court was presented with an alleged Confrontation Clause violation based on the testimony of a state laboratory DNA expert who opined that the defendant\u2019s DNA matched a DNA profile created by Cellmark Laboratories, where the Cellmark report was not itself admitted into evidence. In a plurality opinion, a majority of justices agreed that the expert\u2019s reference to the Cellmark report did not violate the Confrontation Clause.\nThe Commonwealth argues that in order to mischaracterize Dr. Blum as a surrogate witness, Appellant has distorted his role and testimony regarding the blood alcohol test results. Rather than a mere surrogate, the Commonwealth considers Dr. Blum to be the author of the Toxicology Report. He was, according to the Commonwealth, the assigned forensic toxicologist, who based his expert opinion on his review of the entire file, including the raw data contained in the test printouts, compared the results of the three tests, ensured that they supported each other, verified the correctness of the procedures as logged by the technicians, and certified and authored the Report. The Commonwealth further argues that the lab technicians in this case performed no analysis on the blood specimen; rather, they prepared it for insertion into a machine, which generated raw data that was placed into the file. In this respect, the Commonwealth distinguishes this case from the custodian of records disapproved of in Barton-Martin or the surrogate witness disapproved of in Bullcoming. The Commonwealth further argues that the \u201cend-game\u201d for Appellant and his amici is to require the Commonwealth to call every individual involved in the chain of custody of a lab sample as a witness in order to satisfy the Confrontation Clause.\nIn an amicus curiae brief filed on behalf of the Commonwealth, the Pennsylvania District Attorneys Association (PDAA) argues that expert opinion testimony such as Dr. Blum\u2019s, which relies on information provided by persons not in court, has never been held to violate the Confrontation Clause. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Daniels, 480 Pa. 340, 390 A.2d 172 (1978) (approving of the admission of expert opinion testimony based on out-of-court sources of information and recognizing that \u201call expert opinion is based on \u2018hearsay\u2019 to some extent.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Baumhammers, 599 Pa. 1, 960 A.2d 59, 95 n. 28 (2008) (holding, in the alternative, that expert opinion that relied on statements of persons who did not testify was not \u201ctestimonial\u201d within the meaning of Crawford, and not violative of the Confrontation Clause).\nThe PDAA further argues that this case is factually distinguishable from Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, where either no expert testified at all, or the expert offered no independent opinion and merely introduced the out-of-court statement of someone else in the form of a sworn or certified report. The PDAA also asserts, as does the Commonwealth, that this Court should consider the plurality opinion in Williams to permit a testifying expert witness who is offering an opinion to consider an informal statement by a lab technician regarding test results, without running afoul of the Confrontation Clause.\nThe PDAA refutes Appellant\u2019s argument that there were myriad questions about the blood tests that he was unable to direct to Dr. Blum by contending that, contrary to this argument, these questions would have been a fruitful ground for impeaching Dr. Blum had Appellant chosen to ask them. Further, if Appellant wanted the testimony of the lab technicians who ran the tests, the PDAA argues that he was free to subpoena them and solicit whatever answers he sought; but that their appearance or absence does not alter the fact that Dr. Blum was a competent witness to testify in support of the proffered report.\nAppellant responds by presenting a \u201cproposed workable rule\u201d with regard to who must testify about the results of lab tests: if anyone alters or physically analyzes a sample, runs the machine, or interprets the result, that person must appear to testify at trial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment. In proposing this rule, Appellant asserts that forensic science analysis is conducted in two basic ways: the \u201ccradle to grave\u201d system, where only one person handles and tests the sample; and the assembly line system, where multiple individuals perform discrete tasks. According' to Appellant, six people were involved with the receipt, handling, preparation, and analysis of his blood sample. He suggests that the prosecutor could alleviate its burden to call all of these individuals (who would be required to testify under his proposed rule) by choosing a lab that utilizes the cradle to grave system, instead of one that, like NMS Labs, favors the assembly line system.\nWhether the admission of the Toxicology Report violated Appellant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause is a question of law, for which our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Cannon, 610 Pa. 494, 22 A.3d 210 (2011).\nThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, made applicable to the States via the Fourteenth Amendment, Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965), provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted -with the witnesses against him____\u201d In Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, the Court held that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant\u2019s right to confront those \u201cwho \u2018bear testimony\u2019 \u201d against him, and defined \u201ctestimony\u201d as \u201c[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u201d The Confrontation Clause, the High Court explained, prohibits out-of-court testimonial statements by a witness unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. Id. at 53-56, 124 S.Ct. 1354.\nTo further elucidate the distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial statements, the Court in Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006), addressed two types of statements to police and held that whether a statement is testimonial depends on its \u201cprimary purpose:\u201d\nStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\nDavis, 547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266.\nAlthough Crawford, and Davis did not involve expert evidence, the Court subsequently decided a trio of cases directly bearing on application of the Confrontation Clause to expert testimony premised on scientific evidence. In Melendez-Diaz, the Court addressed the applicability of the primary purpose test to scientific reports, where the state courts had admitted into evidence affidavits reporting the results of forensic analysis identifying material seized from the defendant as cocaine, \u25a0without any live testimony regarding the composition of the substance. These analysts\u2019 affidavits, entitled \u201ccertificates of analysis,\u201d were sworn before a notary public by analysts at the state laboratory as required by state law. 557 U.S. at 308, 129 S.Ct. 2527. The Court had \u201clittle doubt that the documents at issue in this case fall within the \u2018core class of testimonial statements\u2019 \u201d described in Crawford, because they were a \u201csolemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\u201d Id. at 310, 129 S.Ct. 2527 (citing Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354). Additionally, the Court reasoned that the affidavits were made for \u201cthe sole purpose\u201d of providing \u201cprima facie evidence of the composition, quality, and the net weight of the analyzed substance.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 311, 129 S.Ct. 2527 (emphasis in original; internal citation omitted).\nBecause \u201cthe analysts\u2019 affidavits were testimonial statements, and the analysts were \u2018witnesses\u2019 for purposes of the Sixth Amendment,\u201d the Court held that \u201c[ajbsent a showing that the analysts were unavailable to testify at trial and that [the defendant] had a prior opportunity to cross-examine them, [the defendant] was entitled to \u2018be confronted with\u2019 the analysts at trial.\u201d Id. The Court later described this holding as follows: \u201cAbsent stipulation, ... the prosecution may not introduce [a forensic laboratory report stating that a substance was cocaine] without offering a live witness competent to testify to the truth of the statements made in the report.\u201d Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2709 (citing Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct. 2527).\nObserving that \u201c[c]onfrontation is one means of assuring accurate forensic analysis,\u201d and, indeed, the only means constitutionally guaranteed, the Court observed that \u201c[f]orensic evidence is not uniquely immune from the risk of manipulation,\u201d and that because many labs are administered by law enforcement agencies, \u201c[a] forensic analyst responding to a request from a law enforcement official may feel pressure \u2014 or have an incentive \u2014 to alter the evidence in a manner favorable to the prosecution.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 318, 129 S.Ct. 2527. The Court suggested that an incompetent or fraudulent analyst subject to cross-examination may reconsider his false testimony. Id. at 319, 129 S.Ct. 2527 (\u201cLike the eyewitness who has fabricated his account to the police, the analyst who provides false results may, under oath in open court, reconsider his false testimony.... And, of course, the prospect of confrontation will deter fraudulent analysis in the first place.\u201d).\nTo illustrate this point, the Court observed that the affidavits submitted at the defendant\u2019s trial merely identified the analyzed substance as cocaine, and provided no information about \u201cwhat tests the analysts performed, whether those tests were routine, and whether interpreting their results required the exercise of judgment or the use of skills that the analysts may not have possessed.\u201d Id. at 320, 129 S.Ct. 2527. Because \u201c[a]t least some of that methodology [utilized by the laboratory in that case] requires the exercise of judgment and presents a risk of error that might be explored on cross-examination,\u201d id., the Court found \u201clittle reason to believe that confrontation will be useless in testing analysts\u2019 honesty, proficiency, and- methodology \u2014 the features that are commonly the focus in the cross-examination of experts.\u201d Id. at 321, 129 S.Ct. 2527.\nIn dissent, Justice Kennedy noted that the Majority\u2019s holding was problematic in several respects, one of which resulted from the lack of an accepted definition of \u201canalyst:\u201d\nConsider how many people play a role in a routine test for the presence of illegal drugs. One person prepares a sample of the drug, places it in a testing machine, and retrieves the machine\u2019s printout \u2014 often, a graph showing the frequencies of radiation absorbed by the sample or the masses of the sample\u2019s molecular fragments. A second person interprets the graph the machine prints out \u2014 perhaps by comparing that printout with published, standardized graphs of known drugs. Meanwhile, a third person\u2014 perhaps an independent contractor \u2014 has calibrated the machine and, having done so, has certified that the machine is in good working order. Finally, a fourth person \u2014 perhaps the laboratory\u2019s director \u2014 certifies that his subordinates followed established procedures.\nIt is not at all evident which of these four persons is the analyst to be confronted under the rule the Court announces today.\nMelendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 332, 129 S.Ct. 2527 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (internal citations omitted).\nResponding to this point, the Majority stated \u201cwe do not hold, and it is not the case, that anyone whose testimony may be relevant in establishing the chain of custody, authenticity of the sample, or accuracy of the testing device, must appear in person as part of the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 311, n. 1, 129 S.Ct. 2527.\nAlthough Melendez-Diaz established that scientific reports are testimonial and are subject to the requirements of the Confrontation Clause, and provided that when such reports are admitted into evidence, \u201cthe analyst\u201d must testify, 557 U.S. at 311, 129 S.Ct. 2527 it was Bullcoming which took the Court a step closer to resolving who is, or, more precisely, who is not, an appropriate witness. Bullcoming presented a scenario in which the prosecution in a DUI case relied on a forensic laboratory report certifying the results of blood alcohol analysis generated by gas chromatography and signed by the lab analyst who performed the test. During the trial, which pre-dated Melendez-Diaz, the prosecution did not call the analyst who signed the certification, indicating that he had been placed on leave; instead, it called another analyst \u201cwho was familiar with the laboratory\u2019s testing procedures, but had neither participated in nor observed the test on [the defendant\u2019s] blood sample.\u201d Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2709.\nThe question before the Court was \u201cwhether the Confrontation Clause permits the prosecution to introduce a forensic laboratory report containing a testimonial certification \u2014 made for the purpose of proving a particular fact \u2014 through the in-court testimony of a scientist who did not sign the certification or perform or observe the test reported in the certification.\u201d Id. at 2710. The Court, in a five-to-four decision, held \u201cthat surrogate testimony of that order does not meet the constitutional requirement. The accused\u2019s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification, unless that analyst is unavailable at trial, and the accused had an opportunity, pretrial, to cross-examine that particular scientist.\u201d Id.\nIn rejecting the admission of surrogate testimony, which the New Mexico Supreme Court had considered adequate to satisfy the Confrontation Clause in that case, the Court opined that such testimony could not operate as an exception to the Confrontation Clause. Id. at 2716 (\u201c[T]he Clause does not tolerate dispensing with confrontation simply because the court believes that questioning one witness about another\u2019s testimonial statements provides a fair enough opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d). Nor could cross-examining the surrogate witness reveal what the analyst \u201cknew or observed about the events his certification concerned, i.e., the particular test and testing process he employed,\u201d or \u201cexpose any lapses or lies\u201d on the analyst\u2019s part. Id. at 2715. Because the testifying analyst had no first-hand knowledge of the test that was conducted, or the reasons why the testing analyst was on leave, and because the state did not assert that the testifying analyst had any independent opinion concerning the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content, the witness was constitutionally inadequate. Id. at 2715-16.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Majority considered that the analyst who tested the defendant\u2019s blood indicated that the sample was received intact, that the forensic report number and the sample number corresponded, that he performed a particular test in accord with a precise protocol, that no circumstance or condition affected the integrity of the sample or the validity of the analysis, that \u201cthe statements in [the analyst\u2019s portion of the report] are correct,\u201d and that he had \u201cfollowed the procedures set out on the reverse of th[e] report.\u201d Id. at 2710. The Supreme Court held that each of these representations were proper material for cross-examination. Id. at 2714.\nThe Court additionally rejected the state\u2019s argument that the blood analysis report was not testimonial in character, and held instead that the report at issue in that case was testimonial despite the lack of an oath, which had attended the affidavits at issue in Melendez-Diaz, because it was created solely for evidentiary purposes and had sufficient formalities attending it. Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2717 (\u201cLike the analysts in Melendez-Diaz, analyst Caylor tested the evidence and prepared a certificate concerning the result of his analysis. Like the Melendez-Diaz certificates, Caylor\u2019s certificate is \u2018formalized\u2019 in a signed document, headed a \u2018report.\u2019 \u201d) (internal citations omitted).\nJustice Sotomayor authored a Concurring Opinion indicating her agreement with the Majority Opinion that the trial court erred by admitting the BAC report, and wrote separately, inter alia, \u201cto emphasize the limited reach of the Court\u2019s opinion.\u201d Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2719 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part). Because Justice Sotomayor was the fifth vote for the Majority Opinion, her Concurring Opinion limiting the reach of the Majority Opinion is of particular importance. She explained that Bullcoming \u201cis not a case in which the person testifying is a supervisor, reviewer, or someone else with a personal, albeit limited, connection to the scientific test at issue,\u201d Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2722 (Sotomayor, J., concurring); nor was this a case \u201cin which an expert witness was asked for his independent opinion about underlying testimonial reports that were not themselves admitted into evidence.\u201d Id. Finally, Justice Sotomayor noted that Bullcoming was not a case \u201cin which the State introduced only machine-generated results, such as a printout from a gas chromatograph.\u201d Id. Rather, the state introduced, through the testimony of one analyst, the statements of the testing analyst, \u201cwhich included his transcription of the blood alcohol concentration, apparently copied from a gas chromatograph printout, along with other statements about the procedures used in handling the blood sample.\u201d Id.\nJustice Kennedy, joined by three other Justices, authored a dissent which, inter alia, called into question the Majority\u2019s approach as applied in the context of forensic and scientific testing that involves multiple participants. Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2725 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\u201cIt is not even clear which witnesses\u2019 testimony could render a scientific report admissible under the Court\u2019s approach.\u201d).\nShortly after Bullcoming, the Supreme Court announced Williams, 132 S.Ct. 2221, a divided opinion in which the High Court attempted to refine further the primary purpose test in a factual scenario which Justice Sotomayor had specifically recognized was not encompassed in the Bullcoming holding. Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2722 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part) (\u201c[Bullcoming ] is not a case in which an expert witness was asked for his independent opinion about underlying testimonial reports that were not themselves admitted into evidence.\u201d).\nThe facts in Williams arose during a rape prosecution in which a state laboratory analyst testified as an expert witness that she obtained a DNA profile of the rapist from Cellmark Laboratories, an independent lab that tested semen from a vaginal swab taken from the victim. The expert testified that she compared the Cellmark report to the defendant\u2019s recorded DNA profile, and concluded that they matched. Because the Cellmark report itself was not introduced into evidence, the defendant contended that the expert\u2019s testimony relying on that report violated the Confrontation Clause as interpreted in Crawford. The prosecution argued that it was introducing the testifying expert\u2019s reference to the Cellmark report only to show the basis for her expert conclusions about the DNA profile match. Williams resulted in four opinions, none of which garnered a majority for its legal rationale.\nThe lead opinion supported by four Justices in Williams, which was authored by Justice Alito, applied the primary purpose test to hold that the disputed Cellmark report was not testimonial, and the expert\u2019s reliance on this report was a permissible and familiar instance of an expert relying on hypothetical facts not in evidence. Williams, 132 S.Ct. at 2228 (Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court (OAJC)) (\u201cOut-of-court statements that are related by the expert solely for the purpose of explaining the assumptions on which that opinion rests are not offered for their truth and thus fall outside the scope of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d). The OAJC stated that an analyst creating a DNA profile may know that the result will affect a criminal case, but does not know the circumstances or the person accused, and is therefore unlike the \u201caccusing\u201d witness-analysts in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming. Id. at 2250-51.\nIn this regard, the OAJC explained that the DNA profile, like statements of many laboratory analysts, do not easily fit within the linguistic scope of the term \u201ctestimonial statement,\u201d and noted that in every post-Crawford case in which the Court found a Confrontation Clause violation, the statement at issue had the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual; unlike the DNA report, which sought not to accuse the defendant in particular \u201cbut instead to generate objectively a profile of a then-unknown suspect\u2019s DNA from the semen he left in committing the crime.\u201d Id. at 2251. Under the circumstances of Williams, according to the OAJC, \u201cthere was no \u2018prospect of fabrication\u2019 and no incentive to produce anything other than a scientifically sound and reliable profile.\u201d Williams, 132 S.Ct at 2244 (citing Bryant, 131 S.Ct. at 1157).\nJustice Thomas cast the fifth vote for the disposition but did not join the OAJC\u2019s rationale. Instead of employing a primary purpose analysis, Justice Thomas maintained that Cell-mark\u2019s statements \u201clacked the requisite \u2018formality and solemnity\u2019 to be considered \u2018testimonial,\u2019 \u201d id. at 2255 (Thomas, J., concurring), and therefore were distinguishable from the laboratory reports the Court determined were testimonial in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming. Id. at 2260.\nAccordingly, the OAJC would permit the use of an informal statement prepared by someone with no accusatory purpose as the basis for in-court expert testimony, and Justice Thomas, who supplied the fifth vote to affirm, would hold that any informal statement is admissible without violating the Confrontation Clause solely because it was informal. Although the Commonwealth and its amicus rely on Williams as supporting their arguments, we view Williams with caution. When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single legal rationale explaining the results garners a majority, then \u201cthe holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\u201d Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) (citing Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 169 n. 15, 96 S.Ct. 2909, 49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.)).\nThe narrowest grounds for the Court\u2019s affirmance of the lower court in Williams, a disposition on which the lead opinion and Justice Thomas were in agreement, is their conclusion that the Cellmark report was not testimonial. It is irrelevant for our purposes to determine the narrowest commonality of their respective legal rationales for reaching this conclusion, because the lead opinion and Justice Thomas were also in agreement that the facts of Williams were distinct in this regard from the facts of Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming. Specifically, in finding that the Cellmark report was not testimonial, the lead opinion synthesized Williams with Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming as follows:\nThis conclusion [that the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right was not violated] is entirely consistent with Bullcoming and Melendez-Diaz. In those cases, the forensic reports were introduced into evidence, and there is no question that this was done for the purpose of proving the truth of what they asserted: in Bullcoming that the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol level exceeded the legal limit and in Melendez-Diaz that the substance in question contained cocaine. Nothing comparable happened here.\nWilliams, 132 S.Ct. at 2240 (OAJC).\nJustice Thomas similarly distinguished the facts of Williams from Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming:\nThe Cellmark report is distinguishable from the laboratory reports that we determined were testimonial in Melendez-Diaz and in Bullcoming. In Melendez-Diaz, the reports in question were \u201csworn to before a notary public by [the] analysts\u201d who tested a substance for cocaine. In Bullcoming, the report, though unsworn, included a \u201cCertificate of Analyst\u201d signed by the forensic analyst who tested the defendant\u2019s blood sample. The analyst \u201caffirmed that \u2018[t]he seal of th[e] sample was received intact and broken in the laboratory,\u2019 that \u2018the statements in [the analyst\u2019s block of the report] are correct,\u2019 and that he had \u2018followed the procedures set out on the reverse of th[e] report.\u2019 \u201d\nId. at 2260 (Thomas, J., concurring). Accordingly, the lead opinion and concurring opinion regarded the Cellmark report as non-testimonial, and not analogous to the reports admitted in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming. As explained below, we view the Toxicology Report at issue in this case as similar to the scientific reports in Melendez-Diaz Diaz and Bullcoming, and, guided by these opinions, hold that it is likewise testimonial. We therefore find Williams distinguishable, and of little assistance in deciding the matter before us.\nStarting with the premise that \u201cif an out-of-court statement is testimonial in nature, it may not be introduced against the accused at trial unless the witness who made the statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to confront that witness,\u201d Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2713, we consider whether the Toxicology Report is testimonial. Examining the facts of the testimonial statements considered in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, we conclude that it is. The fact at issue at Appellant\u2019s trial was whether he was driving while intoxicated; the Toxicology Report addressed this fact by identifying the alcohol content of his blood, serving the identical function of live, in-court testimony. See Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 311, 129 S.Ct. 2527 (holding that where the fact in question was the content of the substance found on the defendant, the certificates of analysis identifying the substance as cocaine were testimonial statements). Moreover, the report was made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial, see Crawford, 541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, and was plainly created for an \u201cevidentiary purpose.\u201d Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2717 (a document created solely for an evidentiary purpose, made in aid of a police investigation, is testimonial); Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 311, 129 S.Ct. 2527 (forensic reports available for trial are testimonial statements).\nIn all material respects, the Toxicology Report at issue herein resembles those in Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, because here, as in those cases, a law enforcement officer provided evidence to a laboratory for scientific testing, which produced a report concerning the result of this analysis formalized in a signed document. See Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2717; Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 310, 129 S.Ct. 2527. In accord with Melendez-Diaz and Bullcoming, therefore, the Toxicology Report in the instant case is testimonial, and \u201cthe analysts were witnesses for purposes of the Sixth Amendment.\u201d Before the Report could be introduced as evidence, Appellant was entitled \u201c \u2018to be confronted with\u2019 the analysts at trial.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 311, 129 S.Ct. 2527. It is to this requirement we now turn. Although Melendez-Diaz established that scientific reports are testimonial and are subject to the requirements of the Confrontation Clause, and provided that when such reports are admitted into evidence, \u201cthe analyst\u201d must testify, 557 U.S. at 311, 129 S.Ct. 2527 it left unresolved precisely who the analyst is or, in circumstances involving multiple analysts, which analyst or analysts must testify. Although Appellant had the right to confront \u201cthe analyst,\u201d see Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 311, 129 S.Ct. 2527 we acknowledge the concern raised by Justice Kennedy in dissent in Melendez-Diaz: \u201cThere is no accepted definition of analyst, and no established precedent to define that term.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 332, 129 S.Ct. 2527 (Kennedy, J., dissenting). Certainly, the intrinsic difficulty in identifying who is the analyst and who must, therefore, testify, is illustrated by the facts of this case.\nAfter Appellant\u2019s blood was drawn by the phlebotomist at the hospital, it was sent to NMS Labs, where an employee received the blood sample on August 21, 2009. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Silcox removed a small portion of the blood sample for an enzymatic assay test, and another NMS Labs employee placed the blood sample back into storage. In due course, Ms. Chacko removed the blood sample to extract two aliquots for the two gas chromatography tests, and another employee placed the sample back into storage. Yet another employee inventoried the sample. And, of course, Dr. Blum analyzed the data in the case file, determined the validity of the tests by comparing them to the others, decided which of the three tests results to report, certified the results, and signed the Toxicology Report.\nReflecting the number of people who handled Appellant\u2019s blood sample, when Appellant initially objected to Dr. Blum\u2019s testimony about the results of the blood tests, he argued that the phlebotomist from the hospital and the NMS Labs employee who logged receipt of the blood sample should both be made available to testify. After trial, his post-sentence motion was premised on the absence of these two individuals in addition to Ms. Chacko. In his brief to this Court, Appellant has focused on Ms. Chacko\u2019s absence, arguing she is the analyst who must testify. See, e.g., Appellant\u2019s Brief at 6 (\u201cIt is she [Ms. Chacko] who performed the actual blood analysis.\u201d (emphasis in original)). In his reply brief, Appellant proposes a \u201cworkable rule\u201d which would require that \u201cif anyone alters or physically analyzes a sample, runs the machine, or interprets the result, that person must appear to testify----\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 1.\nBecause it is not entirely clear from U.S. Supreme Court precedent which of the individuals involved in producing the Toxicology Report is the analyst for purposes of the Confrontation Clause, both parties herein present compelling arguments. In support of Appellant\u2019s argument that Ms. Chacko must testify is the Court\u2019s concern in Melendez-Diaz with errors and omissions in the testing process. 557 U.S. at 318-19, 129 S.Ct. 2527 (suggesting that the person who interprets a machine\u2019s printout is an analyst and identifying \u201cdrylabbing,\u201d where a forensic analyst reports the results of tests that were never performed, as an example of a fraudulent analysis that may be uncovered during cross-examination). Additionally, in Bullcoming, the Court characterized the representations made by the testing analyst in the report as appropriate for cross-examination, and held that surrogate testimony was insufficient because cross-examining that witness would not reveal what the analyst knew or observed about the particular test and testing process he employed. 131 S.Ct. at 2714-15.\nThere is also, however, support for the Commonwealth\u2019s position that Dr. Blum is the analyst because he engaged in the critical analysis of the three numbers produced by three tests, run on two types of machines, by two different lab technicians, on different days; determined the facial validity of the tests by comparing the results; decided which result to report in the Toxicology Report; and signed his name to the report. See Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2715 (\u201cthe analysts who \u2022write reports that the prosecution introduces must be made available for confrontation ... \u201d).\nThis is a circumstance that is factually distinct from either Melendez-Diaz, which involved no live testimony in support of the certificates of analysis, or Bullcoming, which involved the use of surrogate testimony by another analyst in the same lab with no connection to the laboratory report, in that here, two lab technicians collaborated with and provided raw data on the three tests to the testifying expert, their supervisor, who examined this data and formed his own independent expert opinion, and expressed this opinion in both the Toxicology Report and his live, in-court testimony.\nIndeed, the facts presented herein fall within one of the scenarios identified by Justice Sotomayor as being outside the \u201climited reach\u201d of the Majority Opinion in Bullcoming: where the person testifying is a supervisor, reviewer, or someone with a personal but limited connection with the scientific test at issue. 131 S.Ct. at 2719 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part) (\u201cIt would be a different case if, for example, a supervisor who observed an analyst conducting a test testified about the results or a report about such results.\u201d). We will therefore review in more detail the particular facts presented to examine Dr. Blum\u2019s role in reporting Appellant\u2019s BAC in the Toxicology Report.\nThe Toxicology Report itself is a three-page document indicating on the first page the date it was issued, the requesting police department, Appellant\u2019s name, the positive findings of a BAC of .159%, which represents approximately five drinks, testing codes, information about the specimen received, and a certification that the author will be available for court testimony. On the second page, the Report provides \u201cdetailed findings,\u201d which include the types of tests that were conducted and the reported BAC of .159%. In a section for \u201creference comments,\u201d the Report includes assumptions regarding how it reports the approximate number of drinks, and the certification by Dr. Blum that he \u201cdirectly participated in the determination of the results by reviewing and certifying that the analytical data including internal standards and calculations utilized in reporting the results in this case are accurate and correct.\u201d Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 165. This section further provides that the specimen was tested for the presence of ethanol as follows: \u201cBlood Alcohol Concentration (BAC) analysis performed by Enzymatic Assay and duplicate, internally standardized, Headspace Gas Chromatography (GC). The reported result is the lower of the two Headspace GC results.\u201d Id. The third page includes Dr. Blum\u2019s electronic signature. Ms. Chacko\u2019s name does not appear on the Toxicology Report, nor does Ms. Silcox\u2019s.\nAccording to Dr. Blum\u2019s trial testimony, he reviewed the case folder, verified the chain of custody information and examined the personal identification information. Additionally, he checked the testing that was performed and the data that resulted, evaluated the analytical data from the duplicate gas chromatography and the enzymatic assay, compared the results of the two gas chromatography tests, compared the result of the enzymatic assay test to the two gas chromatography tests, ensured that these numbers supported each other, and reported the lowest of the two gas chromatography test results as Appellant\u2019s BAC.\nWith regard to the two gas chromatography tests and the enzymatic assay, Dr. Blum explained that the purpose of doing more than one type of test is to be certain about the results that are reported:\nWe have concerns certainly that we want to be certain about the results that we report. And the two different analyses allow us \u2014 they are based on two different physical chemical properties, so it helps us to identify the presence of ethyl alcohol. It serves as confirmation not only of the testing procedures but confirmation of the specimen itself because it requires two different people to handle the specimen at two different times to be certain that the sample that we test is correct.\nNotes of Testimony, 8/30/2010, p. 47.\nDr. Blum further explained that while the lab generally tests the blood sample using two different types of tests, the purpose of the enzymatic assay is to verify the results of the gas chromatography. Id. at 49 (\u201cIf the enzymatic assay is within 20 percent of the headspace [gas chromatography] analysis we feel that\u2019s agreeable, that they are likely the same sample.\u201d). Moreover, the two gas chromatography tests have to be within a certain percentage of each other. Id. at 50. As recounted by Dr. Blum, the lab\u2019s practice is to report the lower of the two numbers resulting from the duplicate gas chromatography, which, in this case, was .159%. Dr. Blum reduced his findings to writing by electronically signing the Toxicology Report. Consistent with his conclusion in the Toxicology Report, he testified that Appellant\u2019s BAC was .159%.\nBased on these facts, we hold that Dr. Blum is the analyst who determined Appellant\u2019s BAC. Although he relied on the raw data produced by the lab technicians and utilized this raw data in reaching an expert opinion premised on his evaluation of the case file, he is the only individual who engaged in the critical comparative analysis of the results of the gas chromatograph tests and the enzymatic assay and determined Appellant\u2019s BAC. Dr. Blum was at the top of the inferential chain, and utilized the data that preceded his analysis in reaching his conclusion. He reached the conclusion in the Toxicology Report based on his analysis of the raw data, certified the results, and signed his name to them. As lab supervisor, moreover, Dr. Blum was generally familiar with standard procedures and able to identify any deviations from this procedure or any problems with the particular lab technician. Accordingly, Dr. Blum supervised Ms. Chacko and Ms. Silcox, evaluated and validated the entire record, decided which number to report as Appellant\u2019s blood alcohol content, and signed his name to the report. He was, therefore the certifying analyst who authored the Toxicology Report, and the analyst whom Appellant had a right to confront.\nAlthough Dr. Blum did not handle Appellant\u2019s blood sample, prepare portions for testing, place the prepared portions in the machines, or retrieve the portions after testing, these facts are not dispositive, and do not account for Dr. Blum\u2019s involvement in utilizing the information provided by his subordinates, legitimately relying on their work and that of other employees in the lab who logged receipt of the sample, checked the integrity of the sample, ensured proper storage, and of the phlebotomist who drew Appellant\u2019s blood at the hospital. The Commonwealth complied with Melendez-Diaz by introducing the Toxicology Report with a witness competent to testify to the truth of the statements made in the report, and complied with Bullcoming by assuring Appellant\u2019s right to be confronted with the in-court testimony of the scientist who evaluated the raw data in the case file and signed the certification.\nThese facts distinguish this case from Bullcoming, where the Court specifically disapproved of the surrogate testimony offered in that case in part because the state did not assert that the witness had any independent opinion concerning the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol content. Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2716 (holding that surrogate testimony is unconstitutional when the surrogate played no role in the test). Rather, the testifying witness merely read the analyst\u2019s report into evidence and offered no independent opinion about the defendant\u2019s blood alcohol levels. In contrast, the facts herein, as discussed above, show that Dr. Blum was involved to a sufficient degree in analyzing Appellant\u2019s blood alcohol content and certifying the results of his analysis in the Toxicology Report. His analysis did not simply parrot another analyst, see Bull-coming; rather, he was involved with reviewing all of the raw testing data, evaluating the results, measuring them against lab protocols to determine if the results supported each other, and writing and signing the report. Indeed, it was he who ultimately certified Appellant\u2019s BAC at .159%, and it was he who was cross-examined as to this conclusion. Dr. Blum therefore had direct involvement in reaching the reported BAC, and was not a \u201cmere surrogate\u201d who \u201cplayed no role in producing the BAC report____\u201d Bullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2722.\nWe hold, therefore that Dr. Blum\u2019s expert opinion was contained in the Toxicology Report and was the result of his independent verification of the chain of custody and his independent analysis of the three test results produced by two lab technicians running two types of tests at different times. We agree with the Commonwealth and the Superior Court that the testimonial document was the certified Toxicology Report prepared and signed by Dr. Blum, and that the Commonwealth met its obligation to present the analyst who signed the certificate to testify at trial, consistent with Bullcoming.\nOur holding in this regard is consistent with other decisions that have held that the live, in-court testimony of an analyst who was involved in reaching a scientific conclusion was permissible under the Confrontation Clause even where other, nontestifying analysts provided data to the testifying analyst. See, e.g., Smith v. Florida, 28 So.3d 838 (Fla.2010) (no Confrontation Clause violation in admission of DNA tests because supervisor evaluated raw test results, compared samples, made conclusions, and testified at trial); Leger v. Georgia, 291 Ga. 584, 732 S.E.2d 53 (2012) (supervisor of DNA testing who selected what DNA to analyze, interpreted the data, and prepared the report was the proper witness to testify for confrontation purposes and not the analysts who performed the tests); Rector v. Georgia, 285 Ga. 714, 681 S.E.2d 157 (2009) (finding no Confrontation Clause violation where the state\u2019s toxicologist was not a mere conduit for another doctor\u2019s findings, having reviewed the data and testing procedures to determine the accuracy of the report); Grim v. Mississippi, 102 So.3d 1073 (Miss.2012) (holding that \u201ca supervisor, reviewer, or other analyst involved may testify in place of the primary analyst where that person was \u2018actively involved in the production of the report and had intimate knowledge of analyses even though [he or] she did not perform the tests first hand.\u2019 \u201d); New Jersey v. Rehmann, 419 N.J.Super. 451, 17 A.3d 278 (App.Div.2011) (prosecution did not violate the Confrontation Clause by failing to call as a witness the individual who operated the gas chromatograph because the expert witness who testified authored the certification of the results and drew his own conclusions from the raw data provided by the gas chromatograph); United States v. Boyd, 686 F.Supp.2d 382, 386 (S.D.N.Y.2010) (\u201c ... where the defendant had ample opportunity to confront the Government witness who undertook the final, critical stage of the DNA analysis, and where that witness was personally familiar with each of the prior steps, testified that the analysis included safeguards to verify that errors would not result in a false positive, and demonstrated that the prior steps were essentially mechanical in nature, the Confrontation Clause is satisfied.\u201d).\nConsidering the Superior Court decision in Barton-Martin, which Appellant relies upon, we note that in addition to not binding this Court, Barton-Martin is factually distinguishable, not inconsistent with our opinion, and therefore does not persuade us to reach a different result. In Barton-Martin, the defendant objected to the in-court testimony of the laboratory administrative director and custodian of records, and argued that he was entitled to confront, instead, the laboratory technician who performed the test and prepared the lab report. Barton-Martin, 5 A.3d 363. The trial court admitted the lab report as a business record. See Pa.R.E. 803(6). On appeal, the Superior Court reversed and held that absent a showing the laboratory technician who performed the test was unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination, the laboratory technician\u2019s failure to testify in the Commonwealth\u2019s casein-chief violated the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights. The court held that a custodian of records did not satisfy the Confrontation Clause, and that it is the analyst\u2019s statements in the report that constitute the testimonial statement triggering the right of confrontation.\nHere, in contrast, Dr. Blum did not testify as the custodian of records, nor was the lab report admitted as a business record. Instead, as explained above, Dr. Blum is the analyst whose statements in the Toxicology Report constitute the testimony triggering the right to confrontation. Accordingly, the nature of the witness and the legal rationale in Barton-Martin are dissimilar to this case.\nIn addition, in consideration of the lab scandals detailed by amici and their assertion that cross-examining the lab technician who ran a scientific test may cause errors to be revealed, we observe that if a defendant believes that such errors exist, or possibly exist, the defendant may subpoena the lab technician who ran the test, or, indeed, anyone else, as appropriate, to prove such impropriety. Our holding does not affect a defendant\u2019s ability in this regard. However, the remote potentiality of misconduct should not serve as a basis to permit every defendant in every case to engage in a proverbial fishing expedition, when it is not constitutionally mandated.\nFinally, we observe in closing that Appellant\u2019s preferred \u201ccradle-to-grave\u201d system of scientific and forensic testing, which involves fewer individuals than the alternative assembly line system, and possibly even only a single individual who handles and tests the specimen, would likely have the undesired consequence of making errors more likely. In contrast, using multiple lab technicians to run different tests with different samples on different days, using those test results to check the validity of other results, and having a third party scrutinize the entire process and render the testimonial conclusion on the laboratory\u2019s behalf, makes errors, omission, and fraud less likely, and reduces the likelihood that a single incompetent or dishonest analyst could influence scientific tests.\nAccordingly, we affirm the order of the Superior Court, and hold that the testimony of the forensic toxicologist who analyzed the test results of Appellant\u2019s blood, determined the BAC by comparing these results, and authored the Toxicology Report, satisfied Appellant\u2019s right to confrontation.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices SAYLOR, EAKIN, TODD, McCAFFERY join the opinion.\n. See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3802.\n. \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him....\" U.S. Const, amend. VI.\n. Dr. Blum testified that NMS Labs has \"guidelines ... of agreement on one test versus the other. If the enzymatic assay is within 20 percent of the headspace [gas chromatography] analysis, we feel that's agreeable, that they are likely the same sample. We report the heads-pace [gas chromatography] result.\u201d Notes of Testimony, Aug. 30, 2010, at 50. He further explained the role of the margin of error as follows: \"The two headspace [gas chromatograph] need to agree within a certain percentage. And the level of 159, it would have been within four percent with the agreement of those two values. But the variability of the assay itself, we use five percent variability, so plus or minus five percent.\" Id.\n. See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3802(b) (high rate of alcohol), which provides:\n(b) High rate of alcohol.- \u2014 -An individual may not drive, operate or be in actual physical control of the movement of a vehicle after imbibing a sufficient amount of alcohol such that the alcohol concentration in the individual\u2019s blood or breath is at least 0.10% but less than 0.16% within two hours after the individual has driven, operated or been in actual physical control of the movement of the vehicle.\n. The trial court found Appellant not guilty of DUI pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3802(a)(1) (general impairment).\n. The trial court sentenced Appellant to a term of incarceration of 48 hours to six months\u2019 imprisonment and a $500 fine.\n. Because Appellant's motion referred to analysts in the singular and the plural, it is unclear whether he believed that both Ms. Silcox and Ms. Chacko had to testify, or if only Ms. Silcox should have testified (as she conducted the test that revealed the .159% value that was ultimately reported on the Toxicology Report).\n. The Bullcoming Court found that in regard to gas chromatography, analyst error was not \u201cso remote as to be negligible:\u201d\nAmici inform us, for example, that in neighboring Colorado, a single forensic laboratory produced at least 206 flawed blood-alcohol readings over a three-year span, prompting the dismissal of several criminal prosecutions. An analyst had used improper amounts of the internal standard, causing the chromatograph machine systematically to inflate BAC measurements. The analyst\u2019s error, a supervisor said, was \"fairly complex.\u201d\nBullcoming, 131 S.Ct. at 2711, n. 1 (internal citations omitted).\n. According to amici, an analyst can make an error during any one of several steps of gas chromatography, which they believes would not be uncovered by cross-examination of a surrogate witness, including preparing the sample, loading the machine, selecting the test parameters, and interpreting the results.\n. Although Appellant has not premised his argument on Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, it similarly provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused hath a right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him----\u201d\n. The Court described the class of testimonial statements covered by the Confrontation Clause as follows:\nVarious formulations of this core class of \"testimoniar' statements exist: \"ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent-that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially;\" \"extrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions;\u201d \"statements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d\nCrawford, 541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (internal citations omitted).\n. The Court reiterated the primary purpose test in Michigan v. Bryant, - U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 179 L.Ed.2d 93 (2011), when it held that the primary purpose of statements made by the victim to police who found him mortally wounded in a parking lot was to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. Id. at 1150. Therefore, the victim\u2019s statements were not testimonial, and were admissible at trial in the absence of the victim\u2019s testimony without running afoul of the Confrontation Clause. Id.\n. In this regard, the Court explained that the fact in question, addressed by the certificates of analysis, was whether the substance found in the defendant's possession was, as the prosecution claimed, cocaine, which was the precise testimony the analysts would be expected to provide if they were called to testify at trial. Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 311, 129 S.Ct. 2527.\n. Indeed, as the Court observed, \"[o]ne study of cases in which exonerating evidence resulted in the overturning of criminal convictions concluded that invalid forensic testimony contributed to the convictions in 60% of the cases.\u201d Melendez-Diaz, 557 U.S. at 319, 129 S.Ct. 2527 (citing Garrett & Neufeld, Invalid Forensic Science Testimony and Wrongful Convictions, 95 Va. L.Rev. 1, 14 (2009)).\n. The four dissenting justices rejected the analysis of the OAJC and Justice Thomas, and opined instead that Confrontation Clause jurisprudence mandated that testimony against a defendant be subject to cross-examination, a requirement that fully applies to forensic evidence such as the Cellmark report at issue therein. Williams, 132 S.Ct. at 2264 (Kagan, J., dissenting) (\"Forensic evidence is reliable only when properly produced, and the Confrontation Clause prescribes a particular method for determining whether that has happened.\u201d).\n. Cf. Commonwealth v. Dyarman, 73 A.3d 565, 570 (Pa.2013) (holding that the calibration and accuracy certificates for the device used to test an individual's BAC are nontestimonial because they were not prepared for the primary purpose of providing evidence in a criminal case and their admission into evidence did not violate the defendant's Confrontation Clause rights)."}
