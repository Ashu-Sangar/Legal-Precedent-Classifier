{"id": "8856731", "contents": "The opinion of the court was filed October 6, 1884.\nPer Curiam.\nThis order was not an assignment of the claim so as to give it a preference over other claims. Conceding that a labor claim may be assigned, yet a general order for goods to a specific amount and charged to the account of the maker, gives it no such preference. No evidence was given sufficient to change the legal effect of this order.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
