Such an order is plainly interlocutory and unappealable. The appeals will, therefore, be quashed. Szmigel v. Director General of Railroads, 266 Pa. 573, 110 A. 639; see also Dellacasse v. Floyd, 332 Pa. 218, 221, 2 A. 2d 860; and DiGregorio v. Skinner, 351 Pa. 441, 446, 41 A. 2d 649.\nAppeals quashed."}
