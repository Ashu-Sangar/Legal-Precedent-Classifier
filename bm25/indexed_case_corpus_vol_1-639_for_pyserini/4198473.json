The issues, rephrased for clarity, are:\n(1) Whether 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5571.1 precludes a procedural validity challenge brought more than two years after the effective date of the ordinance.\n(2) Whether the failure to re-advertise the proposed zoning ordinance after changes were made to the zoning map prior to adoption invalidated the ordinance."}
