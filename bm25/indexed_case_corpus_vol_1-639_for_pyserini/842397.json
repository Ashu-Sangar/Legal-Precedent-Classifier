{"id": "842397", "contents": "Kalle v. Sibbald.\nPer Curiam,\nThe plaintiffs alleged the existence of a fraudulent combination between the defendants, which resulted in giving Sibbald the title to the real estate sold, for twenty-five hundred dollars less than the apparent amount of his bid. This difference was the advantage which Sibbald\u2019s knowledge, derived from his co-defendants, gave him over other bidders.\nAfter the bill was filed he paid over this difference with the interest thereon to the assignee. This made the actual cost of the property to him correspond exactly with the apparent cost. Under such circumstances we agree with the learned master that the decree asked for should be refused.\nThe decree is therefore affirmed except so far as it relates to costs, and it is ordered that the record costs, including the master\u2019s fees, be paid by the parties jointly, and the costs of the respective parties be paid by the party who made them.\nBoston Dyewood & Chemical Co. v. Sibbald.\nPer Curiam,\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed except as to costs; and it is now ordered that the record costs including the master\u2019s fee be paid by the parties jointly, and that no bill be taxed for either party."}
