{"id": "1945633", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Boberts,\nAppellant Hilery Kandolph Gwyn was charged with murder and brought to trial before a jury on April 1, 1968. The jury returned a verdict of guilty in the first degree and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant appealed to this Court. We affirmed his judgment of sentence. Commonwealth v. Gwyn, 441 Pa. 546, 272 A. 2d 891 (1971).\nOn May 27, 1971, appellant, assisted by counsel, filed a petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act. The trial court denied the petition without a hearing. This appeal challenges the propriety of the trial court\u2019s dismissal.\nSection 9 3of the PCHA requires that a hearing should be held only \u201c[i]f a petition alleges facts that if proven would entitle the petitioner to relief. . . .\u201d Section 9 further provides that \u201cthe court may deny a hearing if the petitioner\u2019s claim is patently frivolous and is without a trace of support either in the record or from other evidence submitted by the petitioner----\u201d The trial court properly relied upon this provision in denying appellant\u2019s petition, and we thus affirm.\nThe first issue presented by appellant is his allegation that he was without counsel at a preliminary hearing held October 3, 1967. Coleman v. Alabama, 399 U.S. 1, 90 S. Ct. 1999 (1970), which held that Alabama\u2019s preliminary hearing was a critical stage entitling a defendant to the assistance of counsel, is not retroactive. Adams v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 278, 92 S. Ct. 916 (1972); Commonwealth v. James, 440 Pa. 205, 269 A. 2d 898 (1970). Nor has appellant demonstrated any prejudice by the alleged \u201cabsence of counsel\u201d at his preliminary hearing. Prior to Coleman, supra, this Court, following the mandate of White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S. Ct. 1050 (1963), required a defendant to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the absence of counsel at the preliminary hearing. See Commonwealth ex rel. Firmstone v. Myers, 431 Pa. 628, 246 A. 2d 371 (1968); Commonwealth v. Ritchey, 431 Pa. 269, 245 A. 2d 446 (1968); Commonwealth v. Gates, 429 Pa. 453, 240 A. 2d 815 (1968); Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A. 2d 349 (1967); Commonwealth ex rel. LaRue v. Rundle, 417 Pa. 383, 207 A. 2d 829 (1965); Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, 416 Pa. 321, 206 A. 2d 283 (1965).\nFinally, the trial court noted that \u201cthe transcript of said [preliminary] hearing shows the defendant was represented by two attorneys who ha.d been appointed on September 29, 1967 by this Court to represent the petitioner.\u201d Thus both the record and our case law are contrary to appellant\u2019s contentions. Clearly this issue was \u201cpatently frivolous\u201d and therefore did not warrant an evidentiary hearing.\nAppellant next contends that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. As the sole basis for this allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel appellant relies on trial counsel\u2019s failure to introduce a psychiatric report prepared at the Harrisburg State Hospital. The report concluded that there was no evidence to substantiate appellant\u2019s allegation that he had a head injury which precipitated periodic blackouts. Nowhere in appellant\u2019s petition does he indicate how this report, which included observations contrary to appellant\u2019s defense, could have possibly aided him at trial. Certainly trial counsel\u2019s conduct does not approach the \u201cwithout rationale basis\u201d conduct required to sustain a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. Common wealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A. 2d 349 (1967).\nAppellant\u2019s third contention is that the Commonwealth entered into evidence perjured testimony. In light of appellant\u2019s failure to raise this contention in his direct appeal, see Commonwealth v. Gwyn, supra, appellant is now foreclosed from raising this issue in any subsequent proceeding, See Commonwealth v. Simon, 446 Pa. 215, 285 A. 2d 861 (1971).\nThe last allegation in appellant\u2019s petition refers to an incident occurring during the examination of one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. During his testimony the witness started to remove from a bag two knives, neither of which was the murder weapon, found at the scene of the crime. Defense counsel promptly objected and the trial court ordered the witness not to produce the knives. It is uncertain from the record whether any member of the jury actually viewed the knives in question.\nIt is difficult to see how appellant was prejudiced by this occurrence, if indeed any member of the jury actually saw the knives. The jury was already aware of the presence of the knives at the murder scene through the testimony of witnesses admitted without objection. Clearly the prejudice to appellant, if any, was not of such proportions as to rise to constitutional dimensions, and therefore the issue is not cognizable under the Post Conviction Hearing Act.\nAccordingly the order is affirmed.\nPost Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. I* (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. \u00a7\u00a71180-1 et seq. (Supp. 1971).\nPost Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, \u00a79, 19 P.S. \u00a71180-9.\nId. P. L.
