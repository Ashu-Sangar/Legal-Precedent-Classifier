{"id": "1784514", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Chief Justice.\nAppellant Babcock School District seeks to open a peremptory judgment in mandamus entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County directing appellant to transport appellee Timothy Potocki to a public school located outside appellant\u2019s boundaries. Because the Public School Code does not impose upon a school district any duty to transport a resident pupil to a public school outside the district\u2019s boundaries, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and direct that appellee\u2019s complaint in mandamus be dismissed.\nTimothy Potocki and his parents, James Edward Potocki and Diane Linda Potocki, reside within the boundaries of the Babcock School District. The Potockis enrolled their son in Ingomar Middle School, a public school which is located in the North Allegheny School District, and agreed to pay North Allegheny a tuition of $1,800 per year for Timothy\u2019s education. As to the transportation of Timothy to Ingomar, North Allegheny school officials informed the Potockis that they should seek transportation for their son from Babcock School District, the school district in which they reside. The Potockis then requested Babcock to transport their son to Ingomar at Babcock\u2019s expense. That request was refused and the present action was commenced.\nThe transportation of pupils by school districts is governed by Section 1361 of the Public School Code, Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30, as amended, Act of December 29, 1972, P.L. 1726 (Act 372), 24 P.S. \u00a7 13-1361 (Supp.1983-84), which, in relevant part, states:\n\u201cThe board of school directors in any school district may, out of the funds of the district, provide for the free transportation of any resident pupil to and from the kindergarten, elementary school, or secondary school in which he is lawfully enrolled, provided that such school is not operated for profit and is located within the district boundaries or outside the district boundaries at a distance not exceeding ten miles by the nearest public highway .... When provision is made by a board of school directors for the transportation of public school pupils to and from such schools . . . the board of school directors shall also make identical provision for the free transportation of pupil\u2019s who regularly attend nonpublic kindergarten, elementary and high schools not operated for profit to and from such schools . . . . \u201d\nWe agree with appellant that while Section 1361 was designed to ensure the adequate transportation of resident pupils attending non-public schools once a district has determined to transport public school children, see Springfield School District v. Department of Education, 483 Pa. 539, 397 A.2d 1154 (1979), that section does not mandate that pupils be transported to public schools outside the school district. In relevant part the plain language of Section 1361 provides only that \u201c[t]he board of school directors . . . may .. . provide for the free transportation of any resident pupil... . ,\u201d not that it must do so. As this Court has observed, \u201c[t]he Act .. . does not require a school district to provide any free transportation at all to any pupils.\u201d Roberts v. School District of Scranton, 462 Pa. 464, 470, 341 A.2d 475, 479 (1975).\nBecause the Potockis have elected to enroll their son in a public school outside the boundaries of the Babcock School District, and the school district has exercised its statutory discretion not to transport resident students, it is incumbent upon the Potockis, and not the Babcock School District, to provide their son with transportation to that school. Babcock is a provider of educational services to its resident pupils, not a provider of free transportation services to resident pupils whose parents have elected to enroll their children in a public school in another school district.\nOrder of the Commonwealth Court reversed and record remanded to the court of common pleas with the direction that the complaint in mandamus be dismissed.\nIn affirming the entry of the peremptory judgment, the Commonwealth Court relied upon Springfield, supra, to hold that \u201cSection 1361 of the Public School Code requires school districts which provide any free transportation to resident pupils to provide it to all such pupils attending public or private schools located within the district or a ten-mile radius thereof.\u201d Babcock v. Potocki, 71 Pa. Cmwlth. 504, 508, 455 A.2d 273, 275 (1983) (footnotes omitted). The Commonwealth Court\u2019s reliance on Springfield was misplaced, as that case concerned only the transportation of resident pupils to non-public schools, not, as here, transportation of a resident pupil to a public school outside a district\u2019s boundaries."}
