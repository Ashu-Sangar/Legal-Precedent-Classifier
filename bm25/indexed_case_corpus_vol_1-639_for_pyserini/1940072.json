{"id": "1940072", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nAppellant, Gregory Nathan, an eighteen-year-old with a ninth grade education, was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. After the denial of his post-trial motions by a court en banc and entry of the judgment of sentence, appellant filed an appeal. Although appellant, in his brief and oral argument, alleged numerous trial errors, because we find that the statement made by appellant to the police should not have been introduced into evidence, we will not deal with appellant\u2019s other allegations. The improper introduction of his statement into evidence, by itself, entitles appellant to a new trial.\nThe circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s statement are as follows:\nEarly in the morning of August 29, 1968, Joseph Gatalsky was shot on a downtown Pittsburgh street. On August 31, 1968, appellant, having heard that he was the subject of a police search, voluntarily surrendered to the Willdnsburg Borough police. Appellant was read certain warnings contained in a printed form prepared by the Willdnsburg Police Department. The suppression court ruled that these warnings were not in conformity with the dictates of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), but that ruling does not concern us here, because appellant was given proper warnings, by the Pittsburgh police en route to the City of Pittsburgh Public Safety Building, and the court ordered that any statements made prior to his arrival there should be suppressed. Since the subsequent statements which appellant made to the Pittsburgh police were in no way tainted by the statements appellant had made to a Wilkinsburg police officer, of which statements the Pittsburgh police were not even aware, the inadequate warnings which appellant received in Wilkinsburg did not render the later statements inadmissible. Commonwealth v. Marabel, 445 Pa. 435, 283 A. 2d 285 (1971), Commonwealth v. Frazier, 443 Pa. 178, 279 A. 2d 33 (1971).\nAfter appellant was given the proper warnings by a member of the Pittsburgh Police Department, he requested an attorney. Since appellant had no particular attorney in mind, he was shown a list of members of the Allegheny County Bar who handle criminal cases. From this list, appellant picked Byrd B. Brown, Esquire, and the police officers promptly placed a call to Mr. Brown\u2019s office, where they learned from his answering service that he was not in. Once the request for counsel was made, the calls placed and counsel found to be unobtainable, the police did not attempt any interrogation.\nAppellant was then removed from the Homicide Bureau to the \u201cbull pen\u201d in another part of the Public Safety Building. The two Pittsburgh police officers who had accompanied the appellant to Pittsburgh from Wilkinsburg and who were present when the warnings were read, and had attempted to reach Mr. Brown, then departed the scene to perform other duties.\nA short time later, Detective Terseak, who had been called at home, informed that appellant was in custody, and asked to report to headquarters, came on duty. He promptly went to the \u201cbull pen\u201d and then accompanied appellant back to the Homicide Bureau, which was, by this time, otherwise unoccupied.\nAccording to Officer Terseak, after advising appellant of his rights by reading them from the police form, Terseak proceeded to ask appellant whether he wished to make a statement. Appellant informed the officer that he had attempted to call Attorney Brown, but that \u201che was out of town.\u201d The officer then asked appellant whether he was \u201cwilling to talk about the case without Mr. Brown being present.\u201d\nAccording to Officer Terscak, lie specifically asked appellant \u201cIn view of the fact that you couldn\u2019t get hold of Mr. Brown, or Mr. Brown was not available, are you now willing to answer our questions without Mr. Brown or any other attorney?\u201d and appellant said he was.\nAppellant claimed that when Officer Terscak brought him from the \u201cbull pen\u201d to the homicide office, he was first shown a statement made by Tracy Morgan, the girl who was with him at the time the murder occurred, and he got angry and decided to give a statement, too, because \u201cshe put everything off on me.\u201d When Officer Terscak was asked whether he had ever showed appellant Tracy Morgan\u2019s statement, he couldn\u2019t recall but he admitted that he \u201cmight have.\u201d\nAppellant also claimed that the officer told him that a \u201cstatement can help you and hurt you, and sometimes its good to give one and sometimes not.\u201d Officer Terscak admitted that he gave appellant this \u201cadvice.\u201d According to the officer, \u201cI usually tell it to everyone. I don\u2019t see nothing (sic) wrong with that.\u201d\nAppellant argues that the admission of his statement made in these circumstances was a denial of his constitutional right to counsel as enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in Miranda v. Arizona, supra. After explaining that in order to protect an individual\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege, he must have the right to have counsel present at the interrogation, because \u201c[t]he circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of his privilege by his interrogators,\u201d Miranda, supra, at page 469, the court held that an individual must be informed that he has the right to consult with a lawyer and to have a lawyer present during any interrogation.\nThe court then went on as follows:\n\u201cIf the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease. ... At this point he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the light to cut off questioning, the setting of in-eustody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked. If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\n\u201cIf the interrogation continues without the presence of an attorney and a statement is taken, a heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel. Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 490.\u201d\nThe court went on to explain that \u201c. . . any evidence that the accused was threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver will, of course, show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive his privilege. The requirement of warnings and waiver of rights is a fundamental with respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual to existing methods of interrogation.\u201d\nWhen appellant told the Pittsburgh police that he wanted an attorney, the interrogation properly ceased. It should not have resumed until Mr. Brown had been located and had consulted with appellant. See Commonwealth v. Leaming, 432 Pa. 326, 247 A. 2d 590 (1968). The fact that Officer Terscak did not know the details concerning the attempt on the part of the Pittsburgh police to locate Mr. Brown for appellant makes no difference. His fellow officers should have noted appellant\u2019s exercise of his rights and his request for Mr. Brown on appellant\u2019s folder. Appellant effectively exercised his constitutional privilege to have an attorney present during interrogation. In order for the Commonwealth to use a statement made after appellant indicated a desire to exercise his rights, it has, in the words of the Miranda opinion, the \u201cheavy burden\u201d of \u201c[demonstrating] that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel. . .\u201d without being \u201cthreatened, tricked, or cajoled\u201d into the waiver.\nWe need not determine whether Officer Terscak did show appellant the confession of his codefendant to find evidence that appellant was cajoled into waiving his rights after he had chosen to exercise them and had validly done so. See People v. Fioritto, 68 Cal. Rptr. 817 (1968). When Officer Terscak told appellant that \u201csometimes it is good to give a statement and sometimes not,\u201d he was engaging in a practice similar to that which we condemned in Commonwealth v. Singleton, 439 Pa. 185, 266 A. 2d 753 (1970), where the authorities told the defendant that any statement made by him could be used \u201cfor or against him.\u201d (Emphasis supplied)\nAs we explained in Singleton: \u201c. . . the inclusion of [the word for] acts as a subtle inducement to speak, helps neutralize the suspect\u2019s awareness of the hostile environment, and vitiates the intended impact of the warning. ... In stating its reasons for requiring the warning about the future use of any statements, the [Miranda] Court said: \u00bf[t]his warning is needed in order to make . . . [the suspect] aware not only of the privilege, but also the consequences of forgoing it. It is only through an awareness of these consequences that there can be any assurance of real understanding and intelligent exercise of the privilege. Moreover, this warning may serve to make the individual more acutely aware that he is faced with a phase of the adversary system\u2014that he is not in the presence of persons acting solely in his interest.\u2019 \u201d (At pages 190-91).\nThe Commonwealth, admitting the impropriety of the words used by Officer Terscak, argues that since appellant was also given a correct statement of the warnings, this case is controlled by Commonwealth v. Camm, 443 Pa. 253, 277 A. 2d 325 (1971).\nHowever, we are dealing with a different issue than we dealt with in Camm. In the instant case, unlike Camm, appellant exercised his privilege. He requested counsel and refused to make a statement without counsel being present. For the Commonwealth to persuade the court that appellant, after exercising his privilege, changed his mind voluntarily, it has the burden of showing that appellant\u2019s change of mind occurred without his being \u201cthreatened, tricked, or cajoled.\u201d Here, since the officer admitted that he told appellant that a statement might help him, the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden.\nJudgment of sentence reversed and case remanded for new trial.\nMr. Justice Jones dissents.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell and Mr. Justice Barbieri took no part in the consideration or decision of this case."}
