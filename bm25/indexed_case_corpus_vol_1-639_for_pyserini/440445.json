{"id": "440445", "contents": "Chief Justice Agnew\ndelivered the opinion of the court, June 26th 1877.\nIt was not quite accurate to say, as the learned judge below did, that the trust in Mi\u2019s. Fry\u2019s deed might have perished, if it had been determined under Ogden\u2019s Appeal. Ogden\u2019s Appeal has not been impaired by the subsequent cases: Earp\u2019s Appeal, 25 P. F. Smith 119; Ashhurst\u2019s Appeal, 27 Id. 464; Ash\u2019s Appeal, 30 Id. 497, and some others, are plainly distinguishable from both Yarnall\u2019s and Ogden\u2019s Appeals, 20 P. F. Smith 501. The grounds are broad and clearly visible, and were stated in Earp\u2019s Appeal, which the other cases mentioned followed. This distinction has been re-stated in the recent case of Williams\u2019s Appeal, 2 Norris 377. In that case there were two instruments creating several trusts of a very different character, but which the auditor and the court below confounded, one of which was governed by Ogden\u2019s Appeal and similar cases, and the other by Earp\u2019s Appeal and its sequents, and so we held.\nMrs. Fry\u2019s deed is plainly governed by the principles stated in Earp\u2019s Appeal and is quite as easily distinguished from Ogden\u2019s Appeal. The trust created by her was, \u201cto pay over the net rents, issues and profits, interest and income thereof for and during the lifetime of the said Emily L. Fry,\u201d to her appointee or herself,\u201cwhether sole or covert,\u201d and \u201cin case of such coverture for her separate use.\u201d Then follows a proviso which gives character to the trust for her life, and show's that it was intended for her protection without regard to coverture, \u201c provided that such rents, issues and profits, interest and income, shall -not be liable to her debts, contracts or engagements, or the debts, contracts or engagements of her present or any future husband.\u201d Thus she clearly indicated her intention to protect herself against her own acts as well as those of any husband, present or future. A trust for coverture only, falls at the death of the first husband, but this she intended to be carried over to any future husband, and in connection with the provision against her own debts she discovers a plain intention to make the trust for life and not for coverture merely:\nMrs. Fry\u2019s trust for her own life is very similar to that in Ash\u2019s Appeal, in which the same expressions occur, to wit: \u201cwhether sole or covert.\u201d Her trust not being for coverture merely, and being equitable and of the income only and for life, was active, and did not fall with the divorce, and therefore could not coalesce with the remainder for her heirs, which was legal. The exclusion of the husband from the descent or succession, in the language defining the persons to take under the intestate law, was therefore an immaterial circumstance, as the rule in Shelly\u2019s case would not operate under any circumstances. The language used in Earp\u2019s Appeal, distinguishing it from Yarnall and Ogden\u2019s Appeals, is quite as applicable to this case.\nMrs. Fry\u2019s will, made long before she declared this trust, and not republished, cannot operate as an appointment under her deed. There are some plausible considerations which might be argued to make the will an appointment under the deed of trust, but upon a careful review of the entire subject we think the intention to execute this posterior power cannot be fairly inferred from the antecedent will, without a republication. This subject was discussed in Bingham\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 849.\nThe decree of the Common Pleas is affirmed, with costs to be paid by the appellants, and the appeal is dismissed."}
