{"id": "1057802", "contents": ".The judgment of -the Supreme Court was entered\nPur .Curiam.\n\u2014\nWeMiscover no error in this-case.. The assign--men't most relied on,, the third, is not sustained. The offer ivas not *to prove an independent offence on the trial of a \u00f3ase having no connection with it, as in Shaffner v. 'Commonwealth, 20 P. F. .Smith \u2022 60,.but it'ay as to prove acts immediately after the first attempt 'to burn the hotel, which tended to show a guilty purpose in Kramer\u2019s mind, such as Avould mak.e it quite probable that he was the same' person Avho had made the former attempt. It was a circumstance in the chain of proof. . The fact that it indicated an attempt to fire the building again did not w\u00e9aken the proof of purpose, because if accomplished, it Avould be a distinct offence. . The'purpose of the first attempt failed because of the extinguishment of the fire, and though it had burned sufficiently to constitute the offence of arson as a complete crime, yet the purpose Avas not complete, for that Avas to consume the building entirely. Being saved, it was clearly the subject of a r\u00e9neAved purpose, and the evidence of this reneAved purpose tended strongly to show that the person Avas the same who made both attempts,-.. The language of the opinion in Shaffner v. CommonAvealth, is directly in favor of this view. It is there said: \u201cto make one criminal act evidence of another, a connection between them must have existed in the mind of the actor, linking them together for some'.purpose h\u00e9 intended to accomplish ; or it must be necessary to identify the person of the actor, by a connection which shows that, he who committed the one must have done the other.\u201d\nSentence affirmed -and the record remitted for execution."}
