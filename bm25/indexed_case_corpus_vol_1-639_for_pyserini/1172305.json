{"id": "1172305", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Stern,\nIn 1925 defendants borrowed from plaintiff association the sum of $10,000 and executed their bond in double that amount, with warrant of attorney attached, secured in the usual manner by a mortgage and stock of the association assigned as collateral. In 1929, the obligation having fallen into arrears, conversations were had between defendant William B. Sheerin and plaintiff\u2019s attorney Frank S. Riordan, She\u00e9rin\u2019s version of which was that, among other suggestions, he offered to \u201cdeed the property for the amount that we owed,\u201d and that \u201cit was understood that cleared the debt.\u201d Following these negotiations Sheerin, on August 26, wrote a letter to the association asking for a \u201csplit\u201d mortgage \u201ctaking credit for the $2,000 I have paid or else I will deed the property over to you and pay the interest for rent.\u201d The letter proceeded: \u201cAt any rate please do not sell the property for $8,000 as you know it is worth more than this amount. I am asking $2,800 for the lot and $8,000 for the house and garage. So you see I would be making a great sacrifice to let it go for what I owe the Building and Loan Association. Will you make a final decision to-night or else do not charge me with any more fines.\u201d On August 28, the attorney wrote to Sheerin that his letter had been discussed at a meeting of the board of directors, that they rejected his proposition of a \u201csplit\u201d mortgage,, and could not make any arrangement with, him as to selling the property after it once became theirs, neither could they agree to a remission of fines. The letter then stated: \u201cThere are three avenues open to you for settlement of this case: First, Pay up the arrearages and continue to do so. Secondly, Foreclosure proceedings. Third, Deed the property over to the Building and Loan without any reservation.\u201d Admittedly, this letter was authorized by the association. On September 25 defendants conveyed the premises to plaintiff. Five days afterwards the latter entered judgment on the bond for the full penal sum. For several years no further action was taken, but when, in 1934, plaintiff issued a sci. fa. to revive the judgment, defendants obtained a rule to show cause why it should not be opened and they be permitted to defend. Depositions were taken. The court discharged the rule, without prejudice to the right of defendants, upon assessment of the damages, to have an issue framed to determine whether they were entitled to a credit in the amount of the withdrawal value of the shares originally transferred as collateral security. Defendants appeal.\nThe case was argued by counsel largely with reference to the technical inquiry whether a merger results when the mortgagee acquires title to the premises, and as to the way in which this question is affected by the mortgagee\u2019s intention and self-interest. In our opinion this is a misconception of the issue here involved. While under many circumstances the mortgagee\u2019s intention, actual or presumed, determines whether a mortgage lien is absorbed and the debt itself extinguished when title to the property is acquired by him, in the present controversy the question is not one, either legally or factually, of plaintiff\u2019s intention, but of the terms of the agreement made between its representative and defendants upon the basis of which the latter conveyed title. A unilateral intention cannot prevail over a contractual obligation. The property could have been deeded upon any terms and conditions mutually agreed upon, and the sole problem here presented is to ascertain what those terms and conditions actually were.\nThe execution of the conveyance of September 25 was evidently in response to, and conditioned upon, the terms of Mr. Riordan\u2019s letter of August 28. Plaintiff stresses the fact that according to that letter the property was to be deeded \u201cwithout any reservation.\u201d That phrase, however, apparently meant that there was to be no implied retention by defendants of any interest, equity, or rights of any kind in the property itself. In Sheerin\u2019s letter of August 26 he had not only asked plaintiff not to sell the property for less than $8,000, but had also suggested that he would \u201cpay the interest for rent,\u201d thus impliedly negotiating for a lease. It was these proposals that plaintiff rejected in stipulating that the conveyance was to be \u201cwithout any reservation.\u201d Those words would not seem to have any bearing upon the question of what effect the conveyance was to have upon the continuance of liability on the bond.\nThe sentence in the Riordan letter of controlling significance is; \u201cThere are three avenues open to you for settlement of this case.\u201d It is clear that the conveyance of the property \u2014 which was one of the designated \u201cavenues\u201d \u2014 Avas to operate as a \u201csettlement of this case.\u201d The question then arises as to the meaning of these words. Did the \u201csettlement of this case\u201d involve merely an abandonment of threatened foreclosure proceedings on the mortgage, or a release of the bonded indebtedness? Clarification and interpretation being required of a phrase not sufficiently self-revealing, the rules of evidence permit resort to antecedent conversations between the parties, in order that thereby light may be cast upon the scope the negotiations were intended to cover and the objective they were designed to attain. According to Sheerin, his oral proposal to Riordan had been \u201cto deed the property for the amount that we owed.\u201d Riordan himself did not testify and his version of the conversation is lacking on the present record. It would appear, therefore, that defendants have produced sufficient evidence that the conveyance of the property was to be in \u201csettlement of this case,\u201d and that by \u201csettlement of this case\u201d the parties meant a settlement of the indebtedness on the bond, to require the opening of the judgment and enable defendants to submit their defense to a jury. It may be added that it is quite incredible, in vieAV of the letter of August 26 in which Sheerin states that he was asking $2,800 for the lot and $8,000 for the house and garage, that he should have been willing unconditionally to surrender so large an equity in the property, whereas, if he had suffered foreclosure proceedings to be instituted, he might at least have had the chance of obtaining a substantial credit on the debt through competitive bidding at the sheriff\u2019s sale, especially when it is remembered that this transaction occurred in 1929, when real estate values had not yet succumbed to the economic depression.\nThe order of the court below is reversed, and the rule to open the judgment is reinstated and herewith made absolute.\nThat the question whether the debt is extinguished if title is deeded to the mortgagee (or when a mortgagee enters satisfaction of the mortgage on the record) must usually rest for its determination upon the agreement between the parties, is illustrated by such eases as Fleming v. Parry, 24 Pa. 47; Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Kelly, 159 Pa. 82; Continental Title & Trust Co. v. Devlin, 209 Pa. 380; Sheehan B. & L. Assn. v. Scanlon, 310 Pa. 6; Murphy v. Zingaro, 82 Pa. Superior Ct. 509; Longacre v. Beers, 106 Pa. Superior Ct. 57. See also 95 A. L. R., Annotation p. 89 et seq. It may be pointed out that, just as a sheriff\u2019s sale on foreclosure extinguishes the mortgage but not the indebtedness on the bond, which may still be recovered by a deficiency judgment, so, even if a mortgage lien be extinguished by merger resulting from a voluntary conveyance of the title, this would not necessarily operate as a release of the obligation on the bond unless it was agreed by the parties that the conveyance should have that effect."}
