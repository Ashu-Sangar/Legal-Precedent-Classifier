{"id": "968867", "contents": "Pek Curiam:\nWe need not waste time by the discussion of a point so unimportant and technical as the refusal of the court below to strike off the appeal, for the non-payment of the costs. As was said by the learned judge below, \u201c It is sufficient to say that the record showed the actual payment of all the costs; that \u00e1 subsequent alteration of the record without notice' to appellant cannot affect his rights. The appeal is good under the authority of Rice v. Constein, 89 Pa. 479.\u201d\nThe remaining assignments raise a more serious question. The defendant company was sued to recover damages for the loss of plaintiff\u2019s mule. The mule was killed upon the track by one of defendant\u2019s locomotives, it was loose, and for the purposes of this case, must be regarded as straying upon the track. The alleged negligence of the company consisted in not ringing the bell or sounding the whistle as the engine approached the crossing near which the mule was killed. If it was the duty of the engineer to blow the whistle as notice to the mule, 1 do not see why the mule should not be held to the rule, to \u201c stop, look and listen.\u201d To apply rules to dumb animals which were intended only for reasonable beings brings us dangerously near to the realm of absurdity.\nJudgment affirmed."}
