{"id": "940139", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe learned referee in the court below reviewed the evidence with great care, and found as a fact, evidently with reluctance arising from the dishonesty of the defense, that the transactions out of which the plaintiff\u2019s claim arose were wagering agreements not enforceable at law. To the facts thus found he applied the law with entire accuracy, and after a most careful examination we are forced to sustain his conclusions.\nJudgment affirmed on the report of the referee."}
