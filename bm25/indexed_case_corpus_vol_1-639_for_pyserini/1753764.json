{"id": "1753764", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nThis is an appeal from the final decree of the Court of Common Pleas, Chester County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, dismissing exceptions of the settlor-beneficiary to the adjudication entered following audit of the amended account of Southeast National Bank of Pennsylvania, trustee, under a Deed of Trust executed by Jeanne P. Mendenhall, dated October 9, 1969.\nThe amended account covering the period from October 9, 1969 to October 31, 1975, was audited before the Orphans\u2019 Court on July 7, 1976. At that time, settlor objected to the account and requested surcharge of the trustee for the following reasons: (1) failure to invest large amounts of cash; (2) failure to sell on two separate occasions a holding of Philadelphia Electric preferred stock; (3) investment and retention of trust assets in Franklin New York Corporation; and, (4) improper concentration of trust assets in bank securities.\nPursuant to the parties\u2019 stipulation that the trust lost $550 income as a result of uninvested cash, the auditing judge awarded a surcharge in that amount. The remaining objections were denied, and, on July 29, 1976, the amended account was confirmed nisi, subject to a surcharge of $550. Exceptions filed to that adjudication were dismissed and the adjudication of July 29, 1976, was adopted as the court\u2019s final decree.\nInitially, we must decide whether the Orphans\u2019 Court applied the correct standard in evaluating the trustee\u2019s performance and in concluding there was no breach of duty in its management of the Mendenhall trust assets. Generally, a trustee who is authorized to retain investments need only exercise the skill and judgment which a prudent person, under similar circumstances, would exercise in connection with the management of his or her own estate. Mereto Estate, 373 Pa. 466, 96 A.2d 115 (1953). However, if the trustee possesses or procures its appointment by representing it has greater skill than that of a person of ordinary prudence, then it is required to exercise such greater skill. Killey Trust, 457 Pa. 474, 326 A.2d 372 (1974). Estate of Cahen, 483 Pa. 157, 168-169, 394 A.2d 958, 964 (1978). See also Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 174 (1959).\nAt audit, settlor maintained that Southeast National Bank (Southeast) was a corporate fiduciary possessing greater skill in the management of trust assets than a person of ordinary prudence and, furthermore, that Southeast, in procuring its appointment as trustee in this matter, represented itself as having such greater skill. Accordingly, settlor argued Southeast should be judged by the standard of a person with such special skill. The auditing judge rejected settlor\u2019s contention stating:\n\u201cIn this case there is no showing that this trustee either had extraordinary skill in the administration of Trusts or that it procured its appointment as trustee in this Estate by representing that it had such skills. For that reason we need not further consider that portion of the rule.\u201d\nThe judge than proceeded to evaluate Southeast\u2019s administration of the trust according to the \u201cprudent man\u201d standard and concluded settlor had not satisfied her burden of proving an abuse of trustee\u2019s discretionary authority. Accordingly, the court denied settlor\u2019s claims for surcharge.\nOur study of the record compels disagreement with the court\u2019s statement that \u201cthere is no showing that this trustee . had extraordinary skill [i. e. greater skill than the ordinary prudent man] in the administration of trusts . .\u201d Hence, we rule the court erred in applying the \u201cprudent man\u201d standard in this case and will remand the record for reconsideration in light of the skills actually possessed by the trustee which skills were greater than those of a prudent man.\nThe basic measure of a trustee\u2019s duty was established in early decisions of this Court which held a trustee was required to exercise only \u201ccommon skill, common prudence and common caution,\u201d and would not be held liable for losses to the trust corpus so long as it acted \u201cas others do with their own goods and in good faith and are not guilty of gross negligence.\u201d Neff\u2019s Appeal, 57 Pa. 91, 96 (1868). See also Eyster\u2019s Appeal, 16 Pa. 372 (1851).\nRestatement of Trusts \u00a7 174 (1935) stated a trustee\u2019s duty in terms of the \u201ccommon prudence\u201d standard but set forth an exception which required a trustee having superior skill to exercise such skill. This Court adopted Section 174 of the Restatement in Stirling\u2019s Estate, 342 Pa. 497, 504, 21 A.2d 72, 76 (1941). See also Killey Trust, supra; Lohm Estate, 440 Pa. 268, 269 A.2d 451 (1970); Mastria Estate, 413 Pa. 278, 196 A.2d 653 (1964); Glauser Estate, 350 Pa. 192, 38 A.2d 64 (1944).\nIn the instant case, the Trust Administrator for Southeast\u2019s Trust Division testified regarding its investment review procedures during the term of the Mendenhall trust as follows: An investment officer was assigned to each trust account. The bank\u2019s investment officers formed an investment committee which reviewed the bank\u2019s holdings and made recommendations to the Trust Administration Committee which made final decisions regarding the acquisition and retention of investments. The bank\u2019s investment officers conducted periodic reviews of all trust accounts based on detailed analyses of the holdings in each account. In addition, the bank employed outside firms as investment analysts, including Merrill-Lynch, Mitchell-Hutchins, Provident National Bank, Drexel-Burnham and Studley-Sherbert. Thus, the record does demonstrate Southeast possessed greater resources and skills than those of the ordinary individual trustee. If, on remand, the court determines Southeast failed to use the resources and skills it possessed in administering the Mendenhall trust, a surcharge is justified for any depreciation in the value of principal resulting from the breach of duty.\nOne further issue requires discussion. Settlor also asserts Southeast\u2019s liability for breach of trust under a second exception to the rule of \u201cordinary prudence\u201d as added by the Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 174 (1957) which states:\n\u201cthe trustee who procures his appointment as trustee by representing that he has greater skill than that of a man of ordinary prudence . . .is under a duty to exercise such skill.\u201d [Emphasis added.]\nIn Killey Trust, supra, this Court adopted the foregoing \u201crepresentation rule,\u201d stating that\n\u201c. . . one who procures his appointment as trustee by representing that he has greater skill than that of a man of ordinary prudence will be held to have such skill as he has represented.\u201d [Emphasis added.] 457 Pa. at 477, 326 A.2d at 375.\nIn Killey Trust, supra, we exacted a higher standard of responsibility from the bank-trustee after concluding it had advertised itself as being an expert in the handling of estate and trust accounts.\nIn the instant case, no public representation of superior skills appears in the record. Settlor maintains that the bank officer, who assisted her in creating the trust, orally represented the bank was qualified to handle a trust of this type and that she relied on that representation. Even if we accepted an oral representation as the equivalent of public advertising' for the purpose of determining the appropriate standard for a trustee\u2019s conduct, the record does not establish a representation of superior skills was made. . The only pertinent testimony was given by settlor on direct examination:\n\u201cQ. And did Mr. Hume indicate to you that the bank was qualified to handle this type of a trust for you?\n\u201cA. Yes. We just thought that they were.\u201d\nThis, without more, is insufficient to prove Southeast procured its appointment as trustee by representing it had greater skill than the ordinary person.\nDecree vacated and the record is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Costs on trustee.\nPOMEROY, former J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Section 174 of the Restatement provided:\n\u201cThe trustee is under, a duty to the beneficiary in administering the trust to exercise such care and skill as a man of ordinary prudence would exercise in dealing with his own property; and if the trustee has greater skill than that of a man of ordinary prudence, he is under a duty to exercise such skill as he has.\u201d\n. In view of this affirmative showing, we need not decide if Southeast should be presumed to have greater competence in the management of trust estates because it is a \u201ctrust\u201d company.

Bogert, Law of Trusts and Trustees (2d ed. 1960), \u00a7\u00a7 685, 706.\nA trustee cannot be surcharged for a breach of his duty unless the breach caused a loss. See, e. g., Mastria Estate, supra.\n. See also Uniform Probate Code \u00a7 7-302 for a similar provision. It states; \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by the terms of the trust, the trustee shall observe the standards in dealing with the trust assets that would be observed by a prudent man dealing with the property of another, and if the trustee has special skills or is named trustee on the basis of representations of special skills or expertise, he is under a duty to use those skills.\u201d\n. The Restatement\u2019s \u201cpossession rule\u201d and \u201crepresentation rule\u201d are not inconsistent with section 7302(b) of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7302(b), which sets a minimum standard of performance for fiduciaries. Nothing contained in section 7302(b) precludes the use of a higher standard to evaluate the performance of a trustee who either possesses or claims to possess greater skill. Section 7302(b) provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny investment shall be an authorized investment if purchased or retained in the exercise of that degree of judgment and care, under the circumstances then prevailing, which men of prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income to be derived therefrom .as well as the probable safety of their capital. . . .\u201d"}
