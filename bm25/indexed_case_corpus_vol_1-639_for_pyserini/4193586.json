{"id": "4193586", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nOn June 5, 2003, appellant, equitable owner of 18.67 acres in Upper Merion Township, Montgomery County, submitted an application to the township\u2019s Board of Supervisors to subdivide the property into two parcels, and to further subdivide one of those parcels into 17 residential lots. The Board twice requested extensions of time to make a decision; \u00a7 508 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 805, as amended, 53 P.S. \u00a7 10508, provides a municipality must take action on an application within 90 days of the next meeting of its governing body or planning agency, or such application will be \u201cdeemed an approval.\u201d Appellant agreed to both extensions; the new deadline for this plan was December 24, 2003.\nPrior to that date, appellant filed a distinct conditional use application for the property. This plan reflected suggestions from the Township Planning Commission, and would have allowed development of 28 townhouse units on a 4.89-acre parcel, with a 8.65-acre open space parcel and a 4.38-acre recreational use parcel. On June 23, 2004, the Board denied this conditional use application, a decision the trial court and Commonwealth Court affirmed on appeal.\nSix days after denial of the conditional use application, appellant filed an action for mandamus and peremptory judgment, asserting the initial subdivision application should be deemed approved under \u00a7 508 because the Board did not act upon it by the December 24 deadline. Mandamus is the appropriate mechanism to obtain recognition of a deemed approval of a proposed land development plan, see Lehigh Asphalt Paving and Construction Company v. East Penn Township, 830 A.2d 1063, 1070 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003), and a peremptory judgment may be entered where no genuine issue of material fact exists and the case is free and clear from doubt. See id.; Pa.R.C.P. 1098. The trial court, finding no genuine issue of material fact existed, granted appellant peremptory judgment.\nThe court determined the conditional use application did not supersede the subdivision application, which was therefore deemed approved under \u00a7 508. The court distinguished the two applications, explaining a conditional use \u201caddresses the use of the land, while a subdivision plan addresses how the land is to be developed. A conditional use application seeks approval for new and potential uses for the land that, if granted, would then require a later submitted subdivision plan to be filed.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 3/18/05, at 5; see also 2 Robert M. Anderson, Law of Zoning in Pennsylvania \u00a7 22.20 (1982) (\u201cWhile the governing body of a municipality has broad discretion in adopting standards for the approval of subdivision and land development plans, it cannot include provisions relating to the use of land. Regulation of use is a matter appropriate for control through a zoning ordinance.\u201d).\nBecause of this distinction, the trial court found inapplicable cases holding that a revised subdivision application causes the time for decision to run from the filing of the revised plan. See Wiggs v. Northampton County Hanover Township Board of Supervisors, 65 Pa.Cmwlth. 112, 441 A.2d 1361, 1363 (1982); DePaul Realty Company v. Borough of Quakertown, 15 Pa.Cmwlth. 16, 324 A.2d 832, 835 (1974). The court distinguished cases holding \u00a7 508 is inoperative where an applicant creates confusion by submitting two inconsistent plans for the same tract. See Morris v. Northampton County Hanover Township Board of Supervisors, 39 Pa.Cmwlth. 466, 395 A.2d 697, 699 (1978). The court also noted Appeal of David Fiori, Realtor, Inc., 55 Pa.Cmwlth. 59, 422 A.2d 1207, 1208 (1980), held two subdivision plans could run simultaneously, and an untimely rejection of the first plan resulted in its being deemed approved. The court expressly noted it did not rely on Fiori, as that case involved two subdivision plans, but found its logic supports the conclusion the law did not preclude simultaneous consideration of a subdivision plan and conditional use application.\nThe Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that by filing the conditional use application, appellant abandoned the subdivision plan application. See Philomeno & Salamone v. Board of Supervisors of Upper Merion Township, 882 A.2d 1044, 1048 (Pa.Cmwlth.2005). Although the court acknowledged the difference between the two types of applications and found each application was made pursuant to separate ordinances, it determined the Board was not required to rule on each application. Emphasizing that the purpose of the mandatory time period under \u00a7 508 is to protect an applicant from dilatory conduct of the Board, see Shelbourne Square Associates, L.P. v. Board of Supervisors of Township of Exeter, Berks County, 794 A.2d 946, 950 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002), the court found the Board\u2019s failure to rule on appellant\u2019s subdivision application did not result from such conduct, but rather from the \u201cconfusion and protracted proceedings\u201d caused by appellant filing a separate and inconsistent conditional use application. See Philomeno, at 1048-49.\nWe granted allowance of appeal to determine whether filing a subsequent conditional use application effectively withdraws a pending inconsistent subdivision application for the same tract of land, or whether \u00a7 508 of the MPC \u201cdeems approved\u201d all applications not acted upon in a timely manner. See Philomeno & Salamone v. Board of Supervisors of Upper Merion Township, 588 Pa. 790, 906 A.2d 1197 (2006) (Table). As the rule is codified at 53 P.S. \u00a7 10508, this is a question of statutory interpretation, and as such, is a pure question of law. See e.g., Commonwealth v. Bortz, 589 Pa. 431, 909 A.2d 1221, 1223 (2006). Questions of law are subject to de novo review, and our scope of review is plenary. Craley v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, 586 Pa. 484, 895 A.2d 530, 539 n. 14 (2006). Coretsky v. Board of Commissioners of Butler Township, 520 Pa. 513, 555 A.2d 72, 74 (1989), held \u00a7 508\u2019s requirements are mandatory, and Kassouf v. Township of Scott, 584 Pa. 219, 883 A.2d 463, 471 (2005), upheld Coretsky\u2019s finding \u00a7 508 is mandatory because the statutory language clearly sets forth the time frame for decisions on land use applications.\nOur courts have long permitted landowners to file inconsistent subdivision or land development applications, and they are entitled to action on all applications. See Fiori, at 1208; Bobiak v. Richland Township Planning Commission, 50 Pa.Cmwlth. 77, 412 A.2d 202, 205 (1980); Capital Investment Development Corporation v. Jayes, 30 Pa.Cmwlth. 283, 373 A.2d 785, 788 (1977). Nevertheless, the Board claims submission of a new plan relieved it of the obligation to review the original plan. It cites Raum v. Board of Supervisors of Tredyffrin Township, 29 Pa.Cmwlth. 9, 370 A.2d 777 (1977), and Abarbanel v. Solebury Township, 132 Pa.Cmwlth. 326, 572 A.2d 862 (1990), regarding good faith requirements in submitting land use proposals, stating \u00a7 508 \u201cdoes not cover every possible interaction between developer and municipality.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Brief, at 7. The Board then discusses cases where revisions of original land use applications were submitted, which extended the time for decision under \u00a7 508. Id., at 7-10 (citing DePaul, Moms, and Wiggs).\nIt is clear that revising a land use application extends \u00a7 508\u2019s 90-day decision period, see Wiggs, at 1363; see also DePaul, at 835. However, it must be a voluntary revision, and contain substantial changes. Id., at 835 (\u201cThe obvious effect of filing the revised plans was to void the original plans and substitute therefor the revised plans.\u201d). Appellant\u2019s conditional use application was not intended to revise the land use application as it dealt with zoning issues as opposed to the original subdivision application, which addressed land use. See 53 P.S. \u00a7 10107(a) (\u201c \u2018Conditional use,\u2019 a use permitted in a particular zoning district.... \u2018Subdivision,\u2019 the division or redivision of a lot, tract or parcel of land by any means into two or more lots, tracts, parcels or other divisions of land....\u201d).\nIn Capital Inv. Dev. Corp., two mutually-exclusive subdivision plans were submitted to the township, and when the township failed to act on either application, the lower court found both plans were deemed approved under \u00a7 508, and the developer had the option to pursue either. Capital Inv. Dev. Corp., at 788. In Bobiak, where the township never formally acted on a preliminary subdivision plan, and the developers did not seek \u201cdeemed approval\u201d for two and a half years after the time period expired, the delay did not abrogate the right to relief under \u00a7 508. Bobiak, at 204-05. Similarly, in Fiori, the developer submitted a land development plan for a shopping center, followed by an alternate proposal for a restaurant on the same site. As the developer did not withdraw his original application, although the township\u2019s board of supervisors denied both applications on the same day, \u201cthe Board\u2019s rejection of [the original] application was untimely and not properly made and communicated under [\u00a7 ] 508[,]\u201d Fiori, at 1208; thus, it was deemed approved.\nHere, the Commonwealth Court did not address Capital Inv. Dev. Corp., Bobiak, or Fiori, though it did acknowledge that \u00a7 508 does not prohibit submitting inconsistent land use applications for the same tract of land. Nevertheless, it found the second application \u201ceffectively abandoned the subdivision plan application\u201d; later the court stated the second plan caused \u201cconfusion and protracted proceedings\u201d which resulted in the failure to rule on the first plan. See Philomeno, at 1048-49. We find no evidence of record supporting either conclusion.\nWiggs and DePaul hold revisions of previously submitted subdivision plans restart the 90-day approval period, but as noted, we are not dealing with revision of an existing subdivision application. Neither case addresses a conditional use application filed in addition to a subdivision plan. Alternate plans are different from revisions of existing plans, especially when, as here, they are filed under different ordinances and involve different requests. The original plan here was not withdrawn, and the record shows no acts consistent with abandonment save the conditional use application. Offering an alternative plan does not make the original submission disappear.\nLikewise, we find no evidence of confusion on the part of the Board, or protracted proceedings beyond the Board\u2019s requests for continuances. Moms holds an applicant creating confusion by submitting two inconsistent subdivision plans renders \u00a7 508\u2019s 90-day protection inapplicable. While the Commonwealth Court properly reiterated the differences between subdivision plans and conditional use plans, the court did not explain how appellant\u2019s actions confused the Board such that it was exempt from adhering to \u00a7 508\u2019s mandatory time frame. \u2022Finding nothing in the record to support this conclusion, we must deem it erroneous.\nBecause the Board did not act on the initial subdivision plan within the mandatory time period under \u00a7 508, the learned trial court correctly deemed it approved. A clear reading of \u00a7 508 requires the township to act on land use applications within 90 days, and the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order is reversed. Additionally, appellant\u2019s Application for Substitution of Legal Owner of the Property Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 502(b) is granted.\nOrder reversed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices BAER, TODD and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\n. If the next meeting is over 30 days after filing, the 90-day period begins to run 30 days after filing, giving the body up to 120 days to render a decision. See 53 P.S. \u00a7 10508.\n. As legal owner of the property, and assignee of the subdivision plan at issue in this appeal, Sabertooth, LLC has been adversely affected in a substantial, immediate, and direct manner. See Hydropress Environmental Services, Inc. v. Township of Upper Mount Bethel, County of Northampton, 575 Pa. 479, 836 A.2d 912, 916 (2003). As such, Saber-tooth has an interest in this appeal's outcome and is an aggrieved party. See id.; Pa.R.A.P. 501 (party aggrieved by appealable order may appeal therefrom); thus, appellant\u2019s Application for Substitution of Legal Owner of the Property Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 502(b) is granted."}
