{"id": "1165833", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Drew,\nStuart Wood died in 1914, unmarried and without issue. His will provided for a trust whereby the trustees were to set aside so much of the income of the residue as, in their discretion, would not be needed to protect and develop his estate, and to divide the income so set aside into three lots. One of the lots was to be paid to testator\u2019s brother Walter during his lifetime, and a second lot to his sister Juliana during her lifetime. The third lot was disposed of as follows: \u201cDuring the lifetime of my brother Edward R. Wood, should he survive me, the one-third part of one of said lots shall be paid to him, and the remaining two-thirds part of said lot shall be divided equally between such of his children as may survive me, and in case of the death of my said brother, the entire lot shall be divided equally between the children who survive.\u201d It was further provided that, upon the death of either his brother Walter or his sister Juliana, the survivor of them should receive the lot of the other, and, upon the death of both, their lots should be divided, in specified proportions, between testator\u2019s niece Juliana and his nephews Charles R. Wood and Edward R. Wood, Jr. A principal distribution was directed at the death of testator\u2019s brothers Edward and Walter and his sister Juliana, ten and twenty per cent in trust for his nieces Mariane and Juliana respectively, and the remainder to be divided equally between his nephews Charles R. Wood and Edward R. Wood, Jr. A provision against anticipation or attachment for debt of either principal or income was included.\nTestator was survived by his brothers Walter and Edward, his sister Juliana, and four children of his brother Edward. Of these children, Charles R. Wood died in 1927, leaving a widow and two children, and Edward R. Wood, Jr., died in 1930, unmarried and without issue. Edward R. Wood, Sr., died in 1932. Testator\u2019s brother Walter was still living at the time of the adjudication. An account filed by the executors was submitted to an auditor, who concluded that the gift of two-thirds of the third lot of income to such of the children of Edward, Sr., as survive testator was a gift to a class, that survivorship within the class was to be implied, and that the shares of Charles and of Edward, Jr., since their respective deaths should be awarded to the surviving members of the class, Mariane Wood Diaz and Juliana Wood, nieces of testator. He further decided that upon the death of Edward, Sr., these two nieces were entitled to the whole third lot of income. Upon exceptions thereto, the auditor\u2019s awards were reversed by the orphans\u2019 court, which held that each of the children of Edward, Sr., took an estate pur autre vie in the two-thirds share of the third lot and that the personal representatives of Charles and Edward, Jr., were entitled to their respective shares of income until the death of the cestui que vie, Edward, Sr., and upon the latter\u2019s death his share fell into the shares of his children. Prom the decree so entered Mariane Wood Diaz has appealed.\nWe agree with the learned auditor that testator has given no directions for the present situation and that rules of construction must therefore be invoked. In the first place, it is clear that the gift of income to \u201csuch of [the] children [of Edward Wood, Sr.] as may survive [testator] \u201d is a gift to a class. A bequest to a number of persons not named, but answering a general description, is a gift to them as a class, where a contrary intention does not appear from the will: Denlinger's Est., 170 Pa. 104; Harrison\u2019s Est., 202 Pa. 331, 335; Brundage\u2019s Est., 36 Pa. Superior Ct. 211; Herman\u2019s Est., 90 Pa. Superior Ct. 512, 516. Whether or not the gift is to a class of course depends on the testator\u2019s intention, which, when it does not sufficiently appear in the will itself, must be settled by rules of construction. Where the gift is \u201cof an aggregate sum to a body of persons uncertain in number at the time of the gift, to be ascertained at a future time, who are all to take in equal or other definite proportions, the share of each being dependent for its amount upon the ultimate number,\u201d the gift is to a class: see Billings\u2019s Est. (No. 1), 268 Pa. 67, 70. An application of these tests to the present case leaves no doubt that the bequest must be regarded as a class gift.\nIn a gift of income to a class, where a member of the class dies without issue before the time for principal distribution, the share of that member falls in and, in the absence of a contrary intent, increases the shares of the surviving members of the class, who therefore take in preference to the personal representatives of the deceased member: Rowland\u2019s Est., 141 Pa. 553; Huddy\u2019s Est., 257 Pa. 528; Maxwell\u2019s Est., 261 Pa. 140; Kemble\u2019s Est., 279 Pa. 368; Nixon\u2019s Est., 306 Pa. 261; Smith\u2019s Est., 110 Pa. Superior Ct. 469; Boyer\u2019s Est., 115 Pa. Superior Ct. 501. The interest is thus one for life, with remainder to the surviving members of the class, where no different intent appears. That the result must be the same where the deceased member leaves issue, but where testator has not indicated an intent that distributees shall upon death be represented by living issue, is clear. In a gift of income, distributees are to be ascertained at each periodic distribution by the formula provided by testator: Rowland\u2019s Est., supra; Rowland\u2019s Est., 151 Pa. 25. This is necessarily true even though testator does not specifically direct a periodic payment; for, from the nature of a gift of income, there must be periodic distribution, whether annually, semiannually, or otherwise, and the distributees must be determined anew at each such period. It follows that, where income is given to a class, the distributees entitled to take at any period of distribution are the members of the class who are alive at that time, or, where representation by issue is provided, the living issue of deceased members. \u201cAt each income-paying period, it is the duty of the trustee to determine who is living to receive payment\u201d: Nixon\u2019s Est., supra, page 266. Where testator has provided a scheme of representation of deceased distributees by their living issue, or has otherwise indicated an intent that the distribution be stirpital, the interest of each member of the class becomes a \u201clife-estate with remainder over to living issue if any and in default of issue of such decedent then over to surviving distributees, per stirpes\u201d: Rowland\u2019s Est., 151 Pa. 25, pages 29-30; Nixon\u2019s Est., supra, page 265; Smith\u2019s Est., supra, page 474. But such an intent may not be presumed. The present will does not contain the slightest suggestion of rep-reservation or of stirpital distribution, and the issue of deceased members are therefore not entitled to claim substitution. Accordingly, the shares of income of Charles and of Edward, Jr., upon their respective deaths increased the shares of the surviving members of the class. There is no force in the argument that the introductory phrase \u201cduring the lifetime of my brother Edward\u201d indicates that in the ensuing gift to the latter\u2019s children the interest of each is pur autre vie, the life of Edward, Sr. Rather does the phrase qualify the whole gift to the class, directing that the payment of two-thirds of the third lot of income to the class shall last as long as Edward, Sr., lives. Upon his death the payment is to continue, increased by the share formerly paid to him.\nOur conclusion that the children of Edward, Sr., took but life interests is supported by other provisions in the will. Upon the death of testator\u2019s brother Walter or of his sister Juliana, the decedent\u2019s share of income is given over to the survivor, and, upon the death of both, the shares of both to testator\u2019s niece and nephews. The interests of Walter and of the sister Juliana are accordingly for life only. Edward, Sr., is likewise given but a life interest in his share. Nothing appears to indicate that any different interests were intended for the latter\u2019s children: see Maxwell\u2019s Est., supra, pages 145-146. Furthermore, it is apparent that the children of Edward, Sr., are the principal objects of testator\u2019s bounty. The gifts of income over to them upon the deaths of Walter and of the sister Juliana, and the direction of a principal distribution among them, make it plain that testator\u2019s primary interest was centered on them, who were undoubtedly known to him, and that he would prefer the shares of deceased children to remain to the survivors, to the exclusion of the personal representatives of the decedents. Another factor which, though not conclusive, is undoubtedly persuasive in support of this conclusion, is to be found in the prohibition against anticipation and attachment for debt. To hold that the personal representatives of Charles and Edward, Jr., are entitled would render the income accruing after their deaths liable for their debts \u2014 a result not consonant with the spendthrift trust provision: see Maxwell\u2019s Est., supra; Nixon\u2019s Est., supra.\nThe cases relied on by the court below and by appellees are inapplicable here. Where it appears from the will that gifts of income were intended to be gifts to individuals as such, and not as a class, the share of an individual dying before the time for principal distribution will pass to his personal representatives, unless specifically restricted to a life interest: Little\u2019s App., 81 Pa. 190; Ritter\u2019s Est., 190 Pa. 102; Grothe\u2019s Est., 229 Pa. 186; French\u2019s Est., 292 Pa. 37; Spang\u2019s Est., 49 Pa. Superior Ct. 314; McGlinn\u2019s Est., 77 Pa. Superior Ct. 582; Bechtel\u2019s Est., 85 Pa. Superior Ct. 14. \u201cAll of the cases following Little\u2019s Appeal are distinguished by the absence of any purpose of the testator to appropriate the estate exclusively to a class of legatees\u201d: Ruddy\u2019s Est., supra, pages 533-534; Nixon\u2019s Est., supra, page 268. Of course, if the testator\u2019s intent, gathered from the whole will, indicates payment of a deceased distributee\u2019s share to his personal representatives, or other particular disposition thereof, the intent will be followed regardless of whether\u2019the bequest is in form an individual gift or a class gift: Leech\u2019s Est., 228 Pa. 311; Harned\u2019s Est., 273 Pa. 237; Hildebrant v. Hildebrant, 42 Pa. Superior Ct. 190; Lafferty\u2019s Est., 59 Pa. Superior Ct. 24. But no such intent appears here, and, since the gift of income is to a class, the shares of deceased members thereof must be awarded to the surviving members of the class.\nThis disposition of the case makes it unnecessary to consider the meaning of the phrase \u201cchildren who survive,\u201d in the gift over upon the death of Edward, Sr. At his death his share of the third lot fell into and increased the gift to his children, and, since survivorship within the class is to be implied, the whole of the third lot of income remained, upon the death of Edward, Sr., to his children then living, to wit, Juliana and Mariane. Whether the word \u201cme\u201d (testator) or the word \u201chim\u201d (Edward, Sr.) is to be read after the phrase \u201cwho survive\u201d is therefore of no consequence, as the learned auditor has pointed out.\nThe decree of the court below is reversed and the \u2022awards of the auditor are reinstated, costs to be paid out of the estate."}
