{"id": "903515", "contents": "Pee Cueiam,\nThe mere possession of the check by the plaintiff, to whose order it was drawn, was presumptive evidence that it was given in payment of a debt, or was given for cash received for it at the time: Gettysburg National Bank v. Kuhns, 62 Pa. 88; Lowrey v. Robinson, 141 Pa. 189, and many other cases. In addition to this presumption there was considerable proof of a consideration of boarding, nursing and attendance on a number of occasions. The learned court below left it to the jury to say whether the check was given in the circumstances claimed by the plaintiff and for a consideration, or whether it was given without any consideration or for a partial consideration, charging that if it was given without any consideration they should find a verdict for the defendant, and if for a partial consideration they should find a verdict to that extent only. This was all the defendant could possibly ask, and clearly was not error. The case was necessarily for the jury. The assignments of error are all dismissed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
