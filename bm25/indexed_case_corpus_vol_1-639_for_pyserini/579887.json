{"id": "579887", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nClair Manning has appealed from an order of the trial court dismissing his complaint in trespass for failure to state a cause of action in negligence. The dismissal occurred following preliminary objections by appellees, John Andy and Frank Andy, individually and trading as J & F Rubber Company and Andy\u2019s Tire Service. On appeal the Superior Court sustained the trial court by a per curiam order. We granted allocatur.\nThe complaint alleged that appellant sustained injuries in an automobile accident caused by Russell E. Walters, who was under the influence of liquor. Appellant was a passenger in Walters\u2019 vehicle when the accident occurred. Both appellant and Walters were employees of appellees, who had earlier held a party for their employees. Appellant further alleged that: \u201cAt said party the [appellees] did furnish or supply intoxicating liquors or beverages which were consumed by the said Bussell E. Walters as well as [the appellant], and did continue to furnish intoxicating liquors or beverages to the said Bussell E. Walters when he was in a state of visible intoxication.\u201d\nIn dismissing the complaint, the trial court held that no cause of action was stated under any theory and specifically held that \u00a7493(1) of the Liquor Code, Act of April 12, 1951, P. L. 90, Art. IV, \u00a7493(1), as amended, 47 P.S. 4-493(1), which defines certain unlawful conduct, does not impose civil liability upon appellees. Section 493(1) of the Liquor Code does impose criminal liability for certain unlawful conduct and reads as follows: \u201cIt shall be unlawful . . . for any licensee or the board, or any employe, servant or agent of such licensee or the board, or any other person, to sell, furnish or give any liquor ... or to permit any liquor ... to be sold, furnished or given, to any person visibly intoxicated. . . .\u201d\nWe find no error in the trial court\u2019s dismissal of appellant\u2019s complaint. Only licensed persons engaged in the sale of intoxicants have been held to be civilly liable to injured parties. Jardine v. Upper Darby Lodge No. 1973, 413 Pa. 626, 198 A. 2d 550 (1964). Appellant asks us to impose civil liability on nonlicensed persons like appellees, who furnish intoxicants for no remuneration. We decline to do so. While appellant\u2019s proposal may have merit, we feel that a decision of this monumental nature is best left to the legislature.\nOrder affirmed.\nAlthough appellant took advantage of an opportunity to amend his complaint, the demurrer was sustained to the amended complaint as well."}
