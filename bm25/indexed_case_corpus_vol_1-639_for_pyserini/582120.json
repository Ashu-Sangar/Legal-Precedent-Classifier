{"id": "582120", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nPrior to his trial on charges of murder and aggravated robbery, appellant Robert Simms moved to suppress an allegedly involuntary written confession. Following a hearing, the motion was denied. At trial the defense unsuccessfully renewed its objection; post-trial motions were also denied. Simms was found guilty by a jury and sentenced to serve concurrent terms of seven and one-half to fifteen years for second degree murder and five to ten years for aggravated robbery. Upon review of all the circumstances, we find appellant\u2019s confession involuntary. We reverse and grant a new trial.\nOn April 3, 1971, Patrick Jones died, apparently as a result of injuries sustained when he was robbed four days earlier. On May 17, 1971, appellant was arrested at his home at approximately 8:30 p.m., and transported to the Police Administration Building. Appellant was placed in an \u201cinterrogation room,\u201d constitutionally-required warnings were administered, and police detectives began questioning him about the death of Patrick Jones. During this initial interview, which lasted from 8:55 to 9:50 p.m., appellant denied any knowledge of the robbery-murder.\nSimms was not interrogated again until the early morning hours of May 18. At 2:00 a.m., appellant was taken to a room where a polygraph examination was administered. The examination ended at 3:30 a.m., and appellant was returned to the interrogation room. Handcuffed to a metal chair, Simms remained there unattended until 9:30 a.m. when questioning resumed. This time, appellant was questioned for approximately ninety minutes.\nOne-half hour later appellant was taken to the polygraph room where he was again examined. This second polygraph test began at 11:35 a.m. and lasted until 12:45 p.m. Appellant was then returned to the interrogation room where he remained until 3:55 p.m., when a third polygraph examination was administered. Two sessions were involved in this examination which terminated at 5:55 p.m. Fifteen minutes later appellant was fed a light meal. Immediately following his dinner, he began dictating a formal statement. Since appellant cannot read, the \u201cwritten\u201d statement was read to him and he signed it at 9 :10 p.m., approximately twenty-five hours after his arrest. Appellant was then arraigned. This statement constituted the sole evidence establishing guilt.\nBecause \u201c[n]o single litmus-paper test for constitutionally impermissible interrogation has been evolved . . . ,\u201d Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 601, 81 S. Ct. 1860, 1878 (1961); Commonwealth v. Eiland, 450 Pa. 566, 573-74, 301 A.2d 651, 654 (1973), we must in each case view the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hallowell, 444 Pa. 221, 226, 282 A.2d 327, 329 (1971); Commonwealth v. Holton, 432 Pa. 11, 17, 247 A.2d 228, 231 (1968). Circumstances which must be considered include the accused\u2019s physical and mental condition, the delay between arrest and arraign-merit, the attitude of the police, and other \u201cdiverge pressures.\u201d Culombe, supra at 602, 81 S. Ct. at 1879; Eiland, supra at 573-74, 301 A.2d at 654. Moreover, this Court has emphasized that when the question of voluntariness passes beyond the realm of physical coercion and into degrees of psychological coercion, the most careful attention will be afforded to any facts, circumstances, or events tending to overbear an accused\u2019s will. Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, 429 Pa. 141, 149, 239 A.2d 426, 430 (1968).\nApplying the totality test to the instant facts, we find this case remarkably similar to Commonwealth v. Eiland, supra. There a twenty year old youth with a tenth grade education initially denied criminal activity, was isolated for several lengthy periods, questioned intermittently, and examined by polygraph. After eleven hours, Eiland signed an incriminating statement. Commonwealth v. Eiland, supra at 573-74, 301 A.2d at 654. This Court reversed the conviction and granted a new trial because we concluded from the circumstances that Eiland\u2019s confession was involuntary.\nHere, Simms was thirty-one years old but had never advanced past the second grade and had an I.Q. of sixty-one. He was questioned intermittently for twenty-two hours between periods of isolation lasting for up to six hours. Throughout these lengthy isolation periods, appellant was handcuffed to a metal chair in a police interrogation room. Three separate polygraph tests were performed. Simms gave no incriminating statement until 6:15 p.m., more than twenty-two hours after he had been placed in custody.\nThis uncontradicted chronology, viewed as a whole, is a textbook example of unconstitutional coercion. We hold that here, as in Eiland, appellant\u2019s will was overborne. See Spano v. New York, 360 U.S. 315, 79 S. Ct. 1202 (1959); Commonwealth v. Hallowell, supra. Certainly this type of coercion is incompatible with the collective conscience of a free society. This confession, not \u201cthe product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker . . . ,\u201d Culombe, supra at 602, 81 S. Ct. at 1879, was involuntary. When the involuntary confession was introduced over objection at trial, appellant was denied due process of law. Crooker v. California, 357 U.S. 433, 435, 78 S. Ct. 1287, 1289 (1958); Commonwealth v. Riggins, 451 Pa. 519, 525, 304 A.2d 473, 476 (1973); Commonwealth v. Hallowell, supra at 225, 282 A.2d at 329.\nThe judgment of sentence is reversed and a new trial granted.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nMr. Justice Eagen concurs in the result.\nIn post-trial motions, and again on appeal, appellant has urged three other grounds as compelling reversal. First, it is argued that appellant\u2019s detention for more than twenty-five hours prior to arraignment violated Pa. R. Crim. P. 118 and thus the resulting confession is inadmissible. See Commonwealth v. Futch, 447 Pa. 389, 290 A.2d 417 (1972). This issue was not raised either in the motion to suppress or at trial. However, we need not reach the Eutch issue or the effect of failure to raise it previously because we hold that appellant\u2019s confession was not freely and voluntarily given. See Commonwealth v. Eiland, 450 Pa. 566, 572, 301 A.2d 651, 653 (1973).\nSecond, it is asserted that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the victim\u2019s death was caused by an act of appellant. Finally, appellant argues that the trial judge erred by allowing proof of causation to be brought out on redirect examination, by interceding in behalf of the Commonwealth, and by permitting the District Attorney to frame hypothetical questions on redirect examination. Because we find appellant\u2019s confession involuntary, we need not address these two arguments.\nThis Court has jurisdiction on appeal from convictions of felonious homicide pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211. 202(1) (Supp. 1973). The Superior Court, by order dated May 13, 1973, transferred to this Court the appeal from the conviction of aggravated robbery.\nSee Davis v. North Carolina, 384 U.S. 737, 86 S. Ct. 1761 (1966); Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U.S. 528, 83 S. Ct. 917 (1963); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 80 S. Ct. 274 (1960).\nAlthough this case does not turn on an application of Commonwealth v. Futch, 447 Pa. 389, 290 A.2d 417 (1972), the unnecessary delay prior to arraignment is nevertheless relevant in determining the voluntariness of Simms\u2019 confession. Commonwealth v. Eiland, 450 Pa. 566, 572, 301 A.2d 651, 653 (1973); Commonwealth v. Koch, 446 Pa. 469, 474-75, 288 A.2d 791, 793-94 (1972). Even prior to Futch an unnecessary delay in arraignment could be considered in assessing the totality of the circumstances influencing an accused\u2019s decision to confess. Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, 429 Pa. 141, 154-55, 239 A.2d 426, 432-33 (1968).\nThe burden is upon the Commonwealth to prove by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the confession was voluntary. Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, 429 Pa. 141, 143-48, 239 A.2d 426, 427-29 (1968).\nSee U.S. Const. amend. XIV, \u00a7 1; Pa. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9."}
