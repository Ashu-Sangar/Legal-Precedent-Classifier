{"id": "1284916", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nThis is an appeal from the final decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint in equity.\nPlaintiff is a minority stockholder in the defendant Pittsburgh Outdoor Advertising Company. He owns 130 shares. The individual defendants are officers and/or directors of the corporate defendant. The essential facts are undisputed and maybe briefly stated:\nPittsburgh Outdoor Advertising Company had outstanding 15,000 shares of which General Outdoor Advertising Company owned 9,252 shares or approximately 61%. This parent-subsidiary relationship between Pittsburgh and General violated the anti-trust laws and resulted in a consent decree being entered in 1929. In September 1955, the entry of another consent decree became imminent, the terms of which would in all likelihood prevent Pittsburgh from taking advantage of profitable expansion opportunities. Thereafter, negotiations began between Pittsburgh and General relative to the purchase of the Pittsburgh stock held by General. . After a survey of Pittsburgh\u2019s real estate, its Board of Directors determined that the book value of its stock was $233.16 per share.\nHenry Posner (President), representing Pittsburgh, Robbins (President), Bauers (Vice President) and Olson (Treasurer), representing General, met in an attempt to negotiate a sale. General carried its 9,252 shares of Pittsburgh stock on its books at a total value of $1.00. The consent decree of October 21, 1955, required General to dispose of its stock in Pittsburgh at \u201cnot less than a fair market value\u201d. Olson offered General\u2019s stock to Pittsburgh for $2,400,000. Posner said that the whole Company \u201cisn\u2019t worth anything over $3,500,000.\u201d After some further conversations Robbins, as President of General, then said \u201cWe have an obligation to oua* stockholders, to onr directors, and there is one fixed figure from which I cannot get away and that figure is $2,150,000 [$232.38 a share]. You either pay that figure or we can\u2019t do business.\u201d Thereupon, Posner, in behalf of Pittsburgh, closed the deal at that price.\nOn October 11, 1955, the Board of Directors of Pittsburgh notified all stockholders of a special meeting to be held December 12, 1955 (1) to authorize the purchase of the 9,252 shares at a total price of $2,-150,000, and (2) to increase the company\u2019s indebtedness from nothing to $2,000,000 in order to finance the stock purchase.\nPittsburgh was unable to secure a loan of $2,000,000. However, the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States agreed to lend Pittsburgh $1,650,000. Pittsburgh itself had surplus cash of $175,000, making a total of $1,825,000 available for the purchase of General\u2019s stock. In order to secure the $325,000 needed to meet General\u2019s price, defendant Posner, Pittsburgh\u2019s President, offered to buy 1400 shares of the 9,252 shares which Pittsburgh was buying from General \u2014 at $232.38 a share.\nOn December 1, 1955, the stockholders of Pittsburgh were notified that at the special meeting of December 12, 1955, they would be asked to authorize the sale of the aforesaid shares to Mr. Posner.\nAt the December 12th meeting, plaintiff\u2019s proxy protested the purchase, claiming, inter alia, that the price of $232.38 was excessive. He likewise protested the sale to Posner for the anomalous reason that the price was too low. Posner then offered the 1400 shares to plaintiff at the same price, but plaintiff\u2019s proxy declined the offer. Despite plaintiff\u2019s objections, all three resolutions were passed. On December 13, 1955, tbe loan and the purchases were completed. That same day-plaintiff instituted this action.\nPlaintiff\u2019s basic complaints are three-fold: (1) the price of $232.38 per share was excessive; (2) the directors should have obtained an outside appraisal of the Company and of the value of its closely held stock, and (3) consequently the individual defendants violated their fiduciary duty to the corporation. The Chancellor found that $232.38 per share \u201cwas fair, reasonable and not excessive\u201d; and that \u201cPittsburgh\u2019s officers and directors acted in good faith and with ordinary prudence and skill\u201d; and these findings were confirmed by the Court en banc.\nIn this closely held Company, in which the officers and directors of Pittsburgh knew the actual value of their stock, we agree with the Court below that under such circumstances it was unnecessary for them to obtain any outside appraisal except an appraisal of the real estate owned by the Company. However, two independent appraisers testified that the fair and reasonable value of the stock was the price at which it was purchased \u2014 its reappraised book value.\nMoreover, Pittsburgh\u2019s directors and stockholders felt that they had to purchase this block of \u201ccontrol stock\u201d in order to continue the present management and to prevent an outsider or competitor from getting control of the Company. The market value of a large or controlling block of stock is of course materially affected by (a) the condition and the prospects of the Company and (b) the large or limited number' of possible purchasers.\nWe note in passing that the wisdom of this purchase has been made apparent by the fact that since that time the corporation has been very successful. In two years it has repaid Equitable Life Assurance Society |537,-000 \u2014 approximately one-third of the principal of the entire loan which, by its terms, was to be repaid over a period of 12 years \u2014 and it is likewise paying dividends to its stockholders of |12 a share. There was no fraud, actual or legal; there was no waste of the Company\u2019s assets, or over-reaching, or violation of duty by the directors or by the stockholders of Pittsburgh Outdoor Advertising Company. Cf. Chambers v. Beaver Advance Corp., 392 Pa. 481, 140 A. 2d 808, as to the rights and duties of stockholders.\nBecause of the unusual facts, and the appellant\u2019s charges of breach of fiduciary duty, we have discussed the merits at some length. However, we intend to decide this appeal on another point.\nPlaintiff\u2019s complaint prayed for a decree voiding all acts of Pittsburgh, and requiring all the transactions to be voided and the status quo to be restored. Obviously, that is impossible. In order to rescind the purchases and to return to General the stock which was purchased by Pittsburgh, and to invalidate and repay to Equitable the loan which it made to Pittsburgh\u2014 General Outdoor Advertising Company, Inc., and the Equitable Life Assurance Society would have to have been joined as indispensable parties, defendants. Plaintiff\u2019s failure to join these indispensable parties in the present suit leaves a Court of Equity without jurisdiction to grant the relief prayed for or any substantial relief whatever, and the appeal must be quashed.\nIn Powell v. Shepard, 381 Pa. 405, 113 A. 2d 261, the Court said (page 412) : \u201cThe absence of indispensable parties \u2018goes absolutely to the jurisdiction, and without their presence the court can grant no relief\u2019: Hartley v. Langkamp and Elder, 243 Pa. 550, 556, 90 A. 402. . . . And, a party is indispensable where his rights are so connected Avith the claims of the litigants that no decree can be made between them without impairing such rights: . . .\u201d\nIn Hartley v. Langkamp and Elder, 243 Pa. 550, 90 A. 402, the Court said (page 556) : \u201cIt is a settled rule of equity jurisprudence that as the absence of an indispensable party goes to the jurisdiction of the court, an objection to the proceeding on that ground may be raised at any time, during the hearing or on an appeal from the decree of the trial court. . .\u201d\nSee also Forbes Road Union Church and Sunday School v. Salvation Army, 381 Pa. 249, 113 A. 2d 311; Hanna v. Chester Times, 303 Pa. 252, 154 A. 591.\n\u2022 Appeal quashed; costs to be paid by appellant.\nPlaintiff\u2019s 130 shares were the only votes against the three resolutions.\nWe agree witli the Court below that General Outdoor Advertising Company, Inc., as a stockholder of Pittsburgh, had the right to vote its shares in favor of the resolution authorizing the purchase by Pittsburgh of General\u2019s stock, and the right to vote its shares in favor of the resolution authorizing an increase in Pittsburgh\u2019s indebtedness, and the right to vote its shares in favor of the resolution authorizing the sale to Posner of the 1400 shares above mentioned, although even if General\u2019s votes were not counted, the remaining affirmative votes were still a majority of stockholders entitled to vote, and all the resolutions were legally adopted: Chambers v. Beaver-Advance Corp., 392 Pa. 481, 488, 489, 140 A. 2d 808."}
