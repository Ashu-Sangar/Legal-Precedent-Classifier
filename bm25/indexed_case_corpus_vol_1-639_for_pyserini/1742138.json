A board of viewers awarded appellant general damages of $23,000 under the Eminent Domain Code for the taking of the building by appellee Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County. The board of viewers also awarded appellant $10,000 of additional, special dislocation damages under Section 601 \u2014 A(b)(3) of the Code, 26 P.S. \u00a7 l-601A(b)(3). Appellee appealed the board\u2019s award of $10,000 to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, contending that the award violated a regulation of the Attorney General of Pennsylvania limiting the award of special dislocation damages to businesses conducted for the lease or rental of real property. The court of common pleas affirmed the viewer\u2019s award of special dislocation damages and the Commonwealth Court reversed. We granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal and affirm.\nSection 201(8) of the Code, 26 P.S. \u00a7 1-201(8), defines \u201cDisplaced persons:\u201d\n\u201c \u2018Displaced person\u2019 means any condemnee or other person not illegally in occupancy of real property who moves or moves his personal property as a result of the acquisition\nSection 601-A(b)(3), 26 P.S. \u00a7 l-601A(b)(3), permits a displaced person \u201cdisplaced from his place of business\u201d to recover moving expenses and expenses of \u201cremoval, transportation, and reinstallation of personal property,\u201d \u00a7 601-A(a), 26 P.S. \u00a7 l-601A(a), and damages for losses of personal property, \u00a7 601-A(b), 26 P.S. \u00a7 l-601A(b).\n\u201cDisplaced persons\u201d may also recover special dislocation damages under Section 601-A(b)(3). These damages are calculated in one of two manners. \u201cOwner-qccupants\u201d are entitled to the greater of forty times \u201cfair monthly rental value\u201d and average annual net earnings, in a sum no less that $2500 but no more than $10,000. \u201cTenants\u201d may also recover these damages based upon actual monthly rent instead of \u201cfair monthly rental value.\u201d Owner-occupants and tenants may recover this additional sum \u201conly if the business (i) cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of its existing patronage, and (ii) is not part of a commercial enterprise having at least one other establishment not being acquired by the acquiring agency, which is engaged in the same or similar business.\u201d \u00a7 601 \u2014 A(b)(3), 26 P.S. \u00a7 1\u2014 601A(b)(3).\nThus, special dislocation damages sought here are part of a cluster of benefits, including moving expenses and damages for lost personal property. They provide temporary income for a displaced commercial enterprise unable to absorb, through increased sales at another business location, losses caused by condemnation.\nAppellant contends that she is an \u201cowner-occupant\u201d within the meaning of Section 601-A(b)(3) entitled to this temporary income. Thus, she argues that the Attorney General\u2019s regulation, denying businesses conducted for lease or rental of real property an award based on fair monthly rental value, is invalid. The Legislature did not intend a condemnee such as appellant to receive special dislocation damages and therefore we reject appellant\u2019s theory for invalidating the regulation.\nThe $23,000 award of general damages fully compensates appellant for the taking of her property and the lost income Section 601-A(b)(3) provides. The Eminent Domain Code, \u00a7 602(a), 26 P.S. \u00a7 l-602(a), fixes damages for property taken at the difference between \u201cfair market value\u201d before and after taking. \u201cFair market value\u201d is defined as the \u201cprice which would be agreed to by a willing and informed seller and buyer.\u201d \u00a7 603, 26 P.S. \u00a7 1-603. As is true of all buildings, the \u201cprice\u201d of an apartment building renting living space to others is its fair market value. One method of determining fair market value is to calculate the present value of future rental income. See In re Condemnation of 10.09 Acres in Lower Swatara Twp., 92 Dauph. 314 (1970) (capitalization of net rents employed to determine fair market value); accord, United States v. 3,698.63 Acres of Land, 416 F.2d 65 (8th Cir. 1969); see 1 Orgel, Valuation Under Eminent Domain \u00a7 179 (2d ed. 1953); Annotation, \u201cIncome As An Element In Determining Value of Property Taken In Eminent Domain,\u201d 65 A.L.R. 455 (1930). Thus, \u201cfair market value\u201d of a rental enterprise such as appellant\u2019s would include rental income lost while the owner searches for a new location. Because appellant has already received compensation for rental income through the award of general damages, an award of special dislocation damages would grant appellant an unintended double recovery.\nThe Legislature\u2019s careful limitation of eligible recipients to \u201cperson[s] . . . displaced from [their] place of businesses\u201d reveals its intent to deny special dislocation damages to landlords such as appellant not physically occupying the premises condemned. Neither appellant nor her business physically occupied the premises. Hence, neither she nor her business was displaced from the premises in the common, everyday sense of those terms as used in Section 601-A(b)(3). See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1903(a) (Supp. 1977) (directing that statutory language be given plain and ordinary meaning). Because the taking did not displace appellant, this section of the Code precludes her recovery of special dislocation damages.\nOrder of the Commonwealth Court affirmed.\nPACKEL, former Justice, did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nNIX, J., concurs in the result.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Act of June 22, 1964, P.L. 84, \u00a7\u00a7 601-603, 26 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-601-1-603 (Supp. 1977).\n. Regulations of the Attorney General on Uniform Relocation Assistance, Reg. 103.4(d), 2 Pa.B. 1335. See infra note 4. The parties have stipulated that if appellant prevails in invalidating the regulation, she is entitled to $10,000; if not, $2500.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp. 1977). This case was reassigned to the writer on April 26, 1978.\n. Regulation 103.4(d) provides:\n\u201cIn the case of a business conducted for the lease or rental of real property, payment under the Code subsection (b)(3) shall be limited to the average net earnings (subparagraph (ii)).\u201d\nThe Attorney General has subsequently amended the regulation. 37 Pa.Code \u00a7 151.4(4)(iv)."}
