{"id": "1782432", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Chief Justice.\nAppellees are tractor-trailer operators who were separately charged under section 4522 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4522, with having operated their vehicles in violation of various Motor Carrier Safety Regulations promulgated by the Federal Highway Administration pursuant to the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 304, and the Department of Transportation Act, 49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1653 & 1655. After hearings before district justices, appellees were found guilty and fined pursuant to section 4522(b). In consolidated de novo proceedings, the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County found appellees not guilty, and held section 4522 unconstitutional on the theory that it impermissibly delegates legislative authority to the federal government.\nOn these appeals, the Commonwealth urges this Court to reject the theory of the court of common pleas and to uphold the constitutionality of section 4522. However, the verdicts of not guilty preclude our consideration of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeals. See Commonwealth v. Ray, 448 Pa. 307, 292 A.2d 410 (1972); Commonwealth v. Haines, 410 Pa. 601, 190 A.2d 118 (1963).\n\u201cPerhaps the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that \u2018[a] verdict of acquittal .. . could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.\u2019 \u201d United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U.S. 564, 572, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 1354, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977), quoting United States v. Ball, 163 U.S. 662, 671, 16 S.Ct. 1192, 1195, 41 L.Ed. 300 (1896). As the Supreme Court of the United States has recently observed, \u201cthe factfinder in a criminal case has traditionally been permitted to enter an unassailable but unreasonable verdict of \u2018not guilty.\u2019 \u201d Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 317 n. 10, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2788 n. 10, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \u201c \u2018[W]e necessarily accord absolute finality to a jury\u2019s verdict of acquittal \u2014 no matter how erroneous its decision ....\u2019\u201d Bullington v. Missouri, 451 U.S. 430, 442, 101 S.Ct. 1852, 1860, 68 L.Ed.2d 270 (1981), quoting Burks v. United States, 437 U.S. 1, 16, 98 S.Ct. 2141, 2150, 57 L.Ed.2d 1 (1978). Accord, Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 497 Pa. 14, 17, 438 A.2d 596, 597 (1981). Thus, where a defendant has been found not guilty at trial, he may not be retried on the same offense, \u201ceven if the legal rulings underlying the acquittal were erroneous.\u201d Sanabria v. United States, 437 U.S. 54, 64, 98 S.Ct. 2170, 2179, 57 L.Ed.2d 43 (1978). As Justice Rehnquist, speaking on behalf of the Supreme Court of the United States, has stated,\n\u201cthe law attaches particular significance to an acquittal. To permit a second trial after an acquittal, however mistaken the acquittal may have been, would present an unacceptably high risk that the Government, with its vastly superior resources, might wear down the defendant so that \u2018even though innocent, he may be found guilty.\u2019 \u201d\nUnited States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 91, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 2194, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978), quoting Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 188, 78 S.Ct. 221, 223, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957). See also Tibbs v. Florida, 457 U.S. 31, 41, 102 S.Ct. 2211, 2218, 72 L.Ed.2d 652 (1982) (verdict of not guilty \u201cabsolutely shields the defendant from retrial\u201d). So, too, no prosecution appeal lies from a not guilty verdict, even where that verdict is \u201cbased upon an \u2018egregiously erroneous foundation.\u2019 \u201d Borough of West Chester v. Lal, 493 Pa. 387, 392, 426 A.2d 603, 605 (1981), quoting Sanabria v. United States, supra, 43 U.S. at 64, 98 S.Ct. at 2178; see Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U.S. 141, 82 S.Ct. 671, 7 L.Ed.2d 629 (1962).\nAccordingly, regardless of the merit of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that section 4522 of the Vehicle Code is constitutional, the adjudication of not guilty entered by the court of common pleas is an absolute constitutional bar to the Commonwealth\u2019s appeals. Hence the Commonwealth\u2019s appeals must be quashed.\nAppeals quashed.\nNIX, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. Section 4522 provides:\n\u201c Violation of Federal statute or regulation\n(a) General rule. \u2014 No person shall drive a vehicle on any highway in violation of any provision of a Federal statute or regulation relating to any type of equipment or documents used in the vehicle while engaged in interstate commerce.\n(b) Penalty. \u2014 Any person violating this section is guilty of a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to pay a fine of $100.\u201d\n. Although appellees have not challenged the jurisdiction of this Court to consider the Commonwealth\u2019s appeals, it is clear that \u201c \u2018[t]he defendants] having been adjudged not guilty by the court which had jurisdiction to try [them,] we are without authority, in the circumstances here presented, to reverse that judgment and order a new trial.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Haines, supra, 410 Pa. at 604, 190 A.2d at 120, quoting Commonwealth v. Preston, 92 Pa.Super. 159 (1927)."}
