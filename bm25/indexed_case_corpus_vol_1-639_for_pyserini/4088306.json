With regard to appellant\u2019s claim that the invalidity of specific signatures or pages of the nomination petition invalidates other signatures or the petition as a whole, we note, \u201cThe invalidity of any sheet of a nomination petition ... shall not affect the validity of such petition ... if a sufficient petition ... remains after eliminating such invalid sheet.\u201d 25 P.S. \u00a7 2936. Thus, a court cannot presumptively invalidate nomination signatures based on nothing more than the invalidity of other signatures obtained by the circulator. See In re Referendum Petition to Amend the City of Pittsburgh Home Rule Charter, 694 A.2d 1128, 1132-33 (Pa.Cmwlth.1997); see also In re Nomination Petition of Flaherty, 564 Pa. 671, 770 A.2d 327, 337-38 (2001) (refusing to invalidate signatures obtained by circulator, despite striking numerous invalid signatures by same circulator).\nCandidate\u2019s Petition for Review is hereby DENIED as moot. Appellant\u2019s Application to be Excused from Filing Reproduced Record is hereby DENIED as moot.\nJustice SAYLOR files a Concurring Statement which Justice TODD and Justice McCAFFERY join."}
