{"id": "1167832", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Schaffer,\nThe question propounded by the appellants in this case is: May a testator, who is able to write his name, sign a will by mark instead, if he chooses to do so? We are of opinion that he may. On this record, however, we are not convinced that the testator was able to write his name freely when he executed his will, for the reason which will hereafter be stated.\nAt the outset it should be noted that it is admitted the will was prepared in accordance with testator\u2019s directions, by a lawyer in good standing selected by him, and that he executed it by his mark in the presence of witnesses, one of them the lawyer.\nThe contention of appellants is that when he executed the will testator was able to write his name, and, this being so, under the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, sections 2 and 3, 20 PS sections 191 and 192, the making of his mark was not a valid execution. Eliding portions of sections 2 and 3 of the act which are not here material they provide: \u201cEvery will shall be in writing, and, unless the person making the same shall be prevented by the extremity of his last sickness, shall be signed by him at the end thereof, or by some person in his presence and by his express direction. ... If the testator be unable to sign his name, for any reason other than the extremity of his last sickness, a will to which his name is subscribed in his presence, by his direction and authority and to which he makes his mark or cross, unless unable to do so, \u2014 in which case the mark or cross shall not be required, \u2014 shall be as valid as though he had signed his name thereto.\u201d (Both sections require proof by two witnesses.)\nThus we have the requirement of signing by the testator himself, unless prevented by the extremity of last sickness, and in that event by some person in his presence and by his express direction; or if unable to sign his name for any reason other than the extremity of his last sickness, his name may be subscribed by another in the testator\u2019s presence, by his direction and authority and he shall make his mark or cross if able to do so, if not, it is not required. So the legalities of execution are (1) signing by the testator unless last sickness prevents, if so, then by another by direction; (2) if unable to sign for any reason other than last sickness, then by another by direction accompanied by testator\u2019s mark if not unable to make it. As we view the act the sufficiency of the reason for not signing his name is for the testator\u2019s determination; \u201cany\u201d reason which moves him not to sign is sufficient provided there is compliance with the other requisites of the act.\nIn their report the commissioners who drafted the act said that its new provisions were intended \u201cto cover cases where a person is unable to sign his name, whether from lack of education or from physical weakness. The provision that the mark may be dispensed with if the testator be unable to make a mark is intended to cover such a case as that of a man who has lost both arms or is paralyzed.\u201d\nWhile it is true this testator could Avrite his name he had a serious nervous affliction causing his hand and arm to shake, which made it difficult for him to do so. He was shown to have endorsed checks by signing his name, but on more public occasions, such as registering as a voter, he did so by a mark, another writing his name. Different methods Avere used to assist him in writing, such as binding his arm, using elastics and putting alcohol on his hand. When the time came for him to sign the will in the lawyer\u2019s office, he said he was not able to write because he was too nervous.\nThe conclusion which we have reached, that the will tvas validly executed, is in line with that announced by us in Novicki v. O'Mara, 280 Pa. 411, 415; Girard Trust Co. v. Page, 282 Pa. 174, 177; Hughes\u2019s Est., 286 Pa. 466, 470; Carmello\u2019s Est., 289 Pa. 554, 558; Francis\u2019s Est., 299 Pa. 398, 400; Kelly\u2019s Est., 306 Pa. 551, 554, and Roney\u2019s Est., 309 Pa. 312.\nIn Brehony v. Brehony, 289 Pa. 267, 271, we said: \u201cWhether a testator can Avrite at all makes no difference in determining the Aralidity of a will, nor does it matter whether he is so stricken that he cannot write, or can write only Avith difficulty. Where testator\u2019s mental conception is entirely clear and he desires to sign the Avill, but his physical powers unassisted will not permit it, and such assistance is called in, the incident of assistance becomes immaterial so long as there is a conscious Avish of the testator that his hand should make the signature. His participation in the slightest degree, or acquiescence in or adoption of the signature is sufficient: McClure v. Redman, 263 Pa. 405, 411; Fritz v. Turner, 46 N. J. Eq. 515, 22 Atl. 125; Kearney\u2019s Will, 74 N. Y. S. 1045. Therefore, it makes no difference whether this will was signed by Mary Brehony herself with the aid of her brother, or by William Brehony at her request, as long as the signature was adopted and legal proof is present: Hughes\u2019s Est., 286 Pa. 466, 469 et seq.\u201d\nThe decree of the orphans\u2019 court sustaining the action of the register in admitting the Avill to probate is affirmed at appellants\u2019 cost."}
