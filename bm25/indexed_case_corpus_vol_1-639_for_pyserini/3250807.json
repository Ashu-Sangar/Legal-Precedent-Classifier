{"id": "3250807", "contents": "OPINION\nChief Justice GAPPY.\nThe issue before the Court is whether Appellant is entitled to reinstatement of his Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d) appeal rights nunc pro tunc in a second PCRA petition, filed more than one year after the date his judgment of sentence became final, when his original PCRA appeal was dismissed because of PCRA counsel\u2019s failure to file a brief. The Superi- or Court quashed Appellant\u2019s appeal as untimely. For the following reasons, the order of the Superior Court is vacated and this matter is remanded to the PCRA court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nThe relevant facts are as follows: Appellant and four accomplices, Kevin Wyatt, Paul Johnson, Michael Mayo, and Kecia Ray, robbed a jewelry store in 1990. During the robbery, a salesperson was shot to death. Appellant supplied the gun, but did not enter the store, remaining in the getaway car with Wyatt. Mayo and Ray pled guilty to murder. Appellant, Wyatt, and Johnson were jointly tried for murder and related crimes in 1993. Following a jury trial, Appellant, Wyatt, and Johnson were convicted of first-degree murder and the related crimes. On June 1, 1993, the trial court sentenced Appellant to life in prison on the murder charge, and to an aggregate sentence of twenty to forty years in prison on the remaining charges. Appellant did not file a direct appeal to the Superior Court. Therefore, his judgment of sentence became final 30 days after June 1,1993. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(3).\nAppellant filed a timely pro se PCRA petition on April 5, 1995 under the prior version of the PCRA and the PCRA court appointed counsel to represent him. Appellant then \u2022filed an amended PCRA petition on April 9, 1997. Appellant listed multiple claims of error, including that trial counsel erred in failing to object to the trial court\u2019s instructions relating to accomplice liability. See Amended Petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, 4/9/1997, at 2. The amended petition also included a claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a notice of appeal following his conviction. Id. On February 19, 1999, the PCRA court dismissed Appellant\u2019s PCRA petition for lack of merit. In the opinion that followed, the PCRA court explained that Appellant was not entitled to reinstatement of his direct appeal rights, since Appellant \u201cdid not allege let alone prove that he requested counsel to file a direct appeal on his behalf.\u201d PCRA court slip opinion, 10/6/1999, at 4.\nPCRA counsel did not file an appeal on Appellant\u2019s behalf, but Appellant filed a timely pro se appeal in the Superior Court. In his pro se statement of matters complained of on appeal under Pa.R.A.P.1925(b), Appellant raised the claim related to trial counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the trial court\u2019s instructions as to accomplice liability. See Statement of Questions Raised on Appeal, 3/19/1999.\nOn April 7, 1999, the PCRA court appointed prior trial counsel, whose stewardship was at issue on collateral review, to represent Appellant on his PCRA appeal. On August 14, 2000, the Superior Court dismissed Appellant\u2019s appeal without prejudice for counsel\u2019s failure to file a brief. The Superior Court did not retain jurisdiction and Appellant did not seek review in this Court.\nOn October 27, 2000, Appellant tiled a second pro se PCRA petition, requesting reinstatement of his PCRA appeal rights nunc pro tunc and claiming that all prior counsel were ineffective. On September 28, 2001, the PCRA court granted Appellant\u2019s PCRA petition, restoring his right to file an appeal nunc pro kmc from the February 19, 1999 order dismissing his first PCRA petition. New counsel was appointed and on December 14, 2001, Appellant filed a PCRA appeal nunc pro tunc in the Superior Court from the PCRA court\u2019s February 19th order dismissing his first PCRA petition. The Superior Court quashed Appellant\u2019s appeal, concluding that Appellant\u2019s second PCRA petition, from which his appellate rights were reinstated nunc pro kmc, was untimely and the PCRA court therefore had no jurisdiction to grant relief. Commonwealth v. Bennett, 842 A.2d 953 (Pa.Super.Ct.2004).\nThis Court granted allowance of appeal to consider whether the Superior Court erred in quashing Appellant\u2019s appeal.\nIt is well settled that the PCRA provides the \u201csole means for obtaining collateral relief\u2019 on claims cognizable under the PCRA. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9542; see also Commonwealth v. Chester, 557 Pa. 358, 733 A.2d 1242, 1250 (1999) (offering that the PCRA subsumes the remedy of habeas corpus with respect to remedies offered under PCRA). To this end, the PCRA envisions that persons convicted of a crime be permitted one review of their collateral claims. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543; Commonwealth v. Peterkin, 554 Pa. 547, 722 A.2d 638, 643 (1998) (stating that the purpose of the PCRA is \u201cto provide a reasonable opportunity for those who have been wrongfully convicted to demonstrate the injustice of their convictions\u201d); cf. Commonwealth v. Judge, 591 Pa. 126, 916 A.2d 511, 520 (2007) (quoting same language from Peterkin). These claims are most often raised as claims of ineffectiveness, but can take on a myriad of forms. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2). The PCRA process includes appellate review of the claims.\nUnder 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545, as amended in 1995, any PCRA petition, including a second or subsequent one, must be filed within one year of the date the judgment of sentence becomes final. This limitation is jurisdictional in nature. See Peterkin, 722 A.2d at 641. As we have previously explained, \u201cjurisdictional time limits go to a court\u2019s right or competency to adjudicate a controversy.\u201d Commonwealth v. Fahy, 558 Pa. 313, 737 A.2d 214, 222 (1999). Jurisdictional time limitations are not subject to equitable exceptions and a court has no authority to extend them except as the statute permits. Id. By placing strict time limitations on the process, it is clear that the Legislature intended that there be finality to the collateral review process. See Peterkin, supra.\nThis preference for finality, however, is tempered by the insertion of three exceptions to the one-year time limitation at subsections (b)(l)(i)-(iii). These exceptions extend the one-year time limitation under limited circumstances, reflecting that the Legislature also recognized that situations might arise when the one-year time limitation must yield. The exceptions are triggered by an event that occurs outside the control of the petitioner, including when \u201cthe facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(ii). The PCRA limits the reach of the exceptions by providing that the exceptions must be pled within sixty days of the date the claim could have been presented. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2).\nWith this framework in mind, we now turn to Appellant\u2019s arguments. Appellant urges this court to consider his petition under the exception to the one-year time limitation set forth in subsection (b)(l)(ii). As we have not previously had the opportunity to consider the exception in circumstances like Appellant\u2019s, we will turn to the construction of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h).\nAs a threshold matter, we must examine whether Appellant waived application of the exception by not raising it in his second or second amended PCRA petition. Instead, he raised it for the first time before this Court. Normally, the PCRA requires a petitioner to allege and prove an exception to the one-year time limitation in his petition. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b); see also Commonwealth v. Wharton, 584 Pa. 576, 886 A.2d 1120 (2005). In this case, however, at the time Appellant filed his PCRA petition, the Superior Court followed the \u201cextension theory.\u201d Under the \u201cextension theory,\u201d the Superior Court construed in limited circumstances an untimely, serial PCRA petition as if it were an \u201cextension\u201d of a timely, but previously dismissed, first PCRA petition. Commonwealth v. Leasa, 759 A.2d 941 (Pa.Super.2000); Commonwealth v. Peterson, 756 A.2d 687 (Pa.Super.2000). The practice was common in cases like Appellant\u2019s, in which an appeal was taken from the denial of the first petition, but the Superior Court dismissed the appeal without prejudice when PCRA counsel failed to file a brief. Appellant relied on and took advantage of this process by alleging and proving the extension theory in his original and amended petitions. The PCRA court agreed that Appellant was entitled to relief and reinstated his appellate rights nunc pro tunc.\nWhile Appellant\u2019s appeal was pending before the Superior Court, the extension theory was explicitly rejected by this Court in Commonwealth v. Robinson, 575 Pa. 500, 837 A.2d 1157 (2003). Accordingly, the Superior Court dismissed Appellant\u2019s second petition for lack of jurisdiction under Robinson. Thus, the question is whether Appellant\u2019s failure to raise the exception at subsection (b)(1)(h) at the time he filed this second petition precludes this Court from applying it to his case.\nThis Court has been faced with this type of question in the context of the PCRA on more than one occasion and we have allowed PCRA petitioners some leeway in the preservation of claims in their petitions when we determined that the circumstances demanded it. For example, we provided for liberal amendment of PCRA petitions following our decision in Commonwealth v. McGill, 574 Pa. 574, 832 A.2d 1014 (2003), which announced the proper framework for alleging a \u201clayered\u201d ineffective assistance of counsel claim. After setting forth the framework for alleging \u201clayered\u201d claims, we recognized that \u201cwe [had] not been clear as to exactly what is required of a PCRA petitioner seeking to plead, present, and ultimately prove a layered claim of counsel ineffectiveness.\u201d Id. at 1024. Accordingly, we held that a remand may be appropriate to give the petitioner another opportunity to properly plead his claim by conforming his petition to the McGill requirements consistent with Pa.R.Crim.P. 905. Id.\nSimilarly, in Commonwealth v. Hernandez, 572 Pa. 477, 817 A.2d 479 (2003), this Court entertained a preservation question substantially similar to the one raised herein. Counsel representing Hernandez had failed to file a Rule 1925(b) Statement on direct appeal. The Superior Court dismissed the appeal and within eight months, Hernandez filed a Petition for Leave to Appeal nunc pro tunc (\u201cNPT petition\u201d) with the trial court. At the time, a NPT petition was the accepted filing in order to have appellate rights reinstated nunc pro tunc. This process was later deemed unavailable in Commonwealth v. Lantzy, 558 Pa. 214, 736 A.2d 564 (1999), wherein we clarified that the appropriate procedure was to file a PCRA petition seeking to have one\u2019s appeal rights reinstated nunc pro tunc.\nThe Superior Court did not believe that Lantzy required dismissal of Hernandez\u2019s claim, since Hernandez had filed his NPT petition before this court\u2019s decision in Lantzy. Ultimately, however, the court affirmed the judgment of sentence on the basis that Hernandez\u2019s claims were without merit. Following the Superior Court\u2019s decision, we granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal to determine whether it should have reached the merits of Hernandez\u2019s NPT petition in light of Lantzy.\nRather than rejecting Hernandez\u2019s claim under Lantzy, we explained that at the time of his petition Hernandez \u201creasonably relied\u201d on the process utilized by the Superior Court. Hernandez, 817 A.2d at 483-84. Furthermore, we noted that Hernandez was \u201ccaught in a jurisdictional trap of [the Superi- or Court\u2019s] making.\u201d Id. at 483. The Superior Court had set up a process for review of claims like Hernandez\u2019s and Hernandez had followed that procedure. Accordingly, we affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s decision with regard to its review of the NPT petition, but expressed no opinion on the underlying merits, since Hernandez had not filed a petition for allowance of appeal.\nIn this case, declining to entertain Appellant\u2019s petition for his failure to plead subsection (b)(1)(h) at the time he filed his instant petition, would be inconsistent with the spirit of McGill and Hernandez, In this case, the Superior Court utilized a process for review of claims like Appellant\u2019s, and Appellant followed that process. As occurred in Hernandez, while Appellant\u2019s petition was pending, intervening case law from this Court altered that process. Like the conclusion in Hernandez, we will not deny Appellant the opportunity to demonstrate that he is entitled to application of the (b)(1)(h) exception as Appellant \u201creasonably relied\u201d on the process set up by the Superior Court, which afforded petitioners nunc pro tunc relief under the \u201cextension theory.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that we can review whether Appellant\u2019s claim meets the requirements of subsection (b)(1)(h) and now turn to the construction of that subsection.\nThe proper interpretation and scope of subsection (b)(1)(h) is one of statutory construction. As such, we rely upon the Statutory Construction Act (\u201cAct\u201d) for guidance. See 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1501 et seq. The goal of statutory construction is to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). To this end, every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions. Id. When the words of a statute are clear and free from ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of following its spirit. 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). Furthermore, we must construe the provisions of the PCRA liberally \u201cto effect their objects and to promote justice.\u201d See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(c).\nThe text of the relevant subsection provides that \u201cthe facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to petitioner and could not have been ascertained by due diligence.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(ii). We have repeatedly referred to this subsection as the \u201cafter-discovered evidence\u201d exception to the one-year jurisdictional time limitation. See Peterkin, 722 A.2d at 643. This shorthand reference was a misnomer, since the plain language of subsection (b)(l)(ii) does not require the petitioner to allege and prove a claim of \u201cafter-discovered evidence.\u201d Rather, it simply requires petitioner to allege and prove that there were \u201cfacts\u201d that were \u201cunknown\u201d to him and that he exercised \u201cdue diligence.\u201d In fact, when the Legislature intended a claim of \u201cafter-discovered evidence\u201d to be recognized under the PCRA, it has done so by language closely tracking the after-discovered evidence requirements. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(b)(vi) (requiring that the evidence be \u201cexculpatory\u201d and \u201cwould have changed the outcome of the trial.... \u201d).\nBy imprecisely referring to this subsection as the \u201cafter-discovered evidence\u201d exception, we have ignored its plain language. Indeed, by employing the misnomer, we have erroneously engrafted Brady-like considerations into our analysis of subsection (b)(1)(h) on more than one occasion. For example, in Commonwealth v. Johnson, 580 Pa. 594, 863 A.2d 423 (2004), appellant argued that the Commonwealth violated Brady by withholding impeachment evidence and that this claim was cognizable under, subsection (b)(l)(ii). We concluded that appellant could not establish that his Brady claim had merit, since the information could have been uncovered before or during trial. We further stated, \u201cas we conclude that appellant\u2019s underlying Brady claim is without merit, we necessarily also conclude that appellant has failed to show that his petition falls within any of the exceptions to the PCRA\u2019s time requirements.\u201d Id. at 425-26; see also Commonwealth v. Breakiron, 566 Pa. 323, 781 A.2d 94, 98 (2001). This conclusion conflated the two concepts as subsection (b)(1)(h) does not contain the same requirements as a Brady claim.\nThe \u201cafter discovered evidence\u201d misnomer and our suggestion that there is some overlap between the doctrine and \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h) have created additional problems in the Superior Court. In one case, the Superior Court specifically held that a petitioner asserting the exception provided in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h) had to meet the statutory requirements and, in addition, show that these new facts constituted \u201c \u2018exculpatory evidence\u2019 that \u2018would have changed the outcome of the trial if it had been introduced.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Palmer, 814 A.2d 700 (Pa.Super.2002) (citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2)(vi) and Commonwealth v. Yarris, 557 Pa. 12, 731 A.2d 581, 588-91 (1999)); see also Commonwealth v. Baker, 828 A.2d 1146, 1147 (Pa.Super.2003) (following Palmer). While the additional requirements are consistent with a Brady claim, see infra n. 8, none of these requirements exist in \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h). Similarly, in Commonwealth v. Holmes, 905 A.2d 507 (Pa.Super.2006), the Superior Court stated that the petitioner had asserted the \u201cafter-discovered evidence exception to the PCRA time-bar\u201d under \u00a7\u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h) and \u00a7 9545(b)(2). Id. at 510. The court, however, then relied on a case decided under \u00a7 9543(a)(2)(vi) to justify its holding that the petitioner had to show that the evidence was not cumulative nor being used solely to impeach credibility, and that the evidence would likely compel a different verdict. Id. at 511, citing Commonwealth v. D\u2019Amato, 579 Pa. 490, 856 A.2d 806, 823 (2004).\nAny confusion created by the mislabeling of this subsection, however, should have been dispelled by our decision in Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 884 A.2d 848 (2005). In Lambert, the appellant raised a number of Brady claims and alleged that the court had jurisdiction over his claims under subsection (b)(l)(ii). The Commonwealth urged us to follow a similar analysis to that set forth in Johnson arguing that appellant must establish a meritorious Brady claim in order to fall within an exception set forth in subsections (b)(l)(i)-(iii). In rejecting the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, we made clear that the exception set forth in subsection (b)(1)(h) does not require any merits analysis of the underlying claim. Rather, \u201cthe exception merely requires that the \u2018facts\u2019 upon which such a claim is predicated must not have been known to appellant, nor could they have been ascertained by due diligence.\u201d Lambert, 884 A.2d at 852. Therefore, our opinion in Lambert indicated that the plain language of subsection (b)(1)(h) is not so narrow as to limit itself to only claims involving \u201cafter-discovered evidence.\u201d Rather, subsection (b)(1)(h) has two components, which must be alleged and proved. Namely, the petitioner must establish that: 1) \u201cthe facts upon which the claim was predicated were unknown \u201d and 2) \u201ccould not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h) (emphasis added). If the petitioner alleges and proves these two components, then the PCRA court has jurisdiction over the claim under this subsection. See Lambert, supra.\nIn this case, by invoking the exception at subsection (b)(l)(ii), Appellant alleges that he did not know that his trial counsel was appointed to represent him in his PCRA appeal until much later in the process. Likewise, he contends that he never received a copy of the Superior Court\u2019s order dismissing his appeal. Rather, he alleges that he attempted to find out the status of his appeal from the PCRA and Superior Courts. Ultimately, he contends that he did not know of PCRA appellate counsel\u2019s failure to file an appellate brief until October 4, 2000, when he received a letter from the Superior Court explaining that his appeal was dismissed due to PCRA counsel\u2019s failure to file a brief. Therefore, Appellant has alleged that there were facts that were unknown to him. Additionally, Appellant has provided a description of the steps he took to ascertain the status of his case. These steps included writing to the PCRA court and the Superior Court. Accordingly, Appellant alleges that he exercised due diligence in ascertaining those facts. Appellant\u2019s allegations, if proven, fall within the plain language of subsection (b)(l)(ii).\nWe must acknowledge,- however, that this is not our first time interpreting this subsection. In Commonwealth v. Gamboa-Taylor, 562 Pa. 70, 753 A.2d 780, 785 (2000), we held that an allegation of PCRA counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness could not be invoked as a newly-discovered \u201cfact\u201d for purposes of this subsection. See also Commonwealth v. Pursell, 561 Pa. 214, 749 A.2d 911, 916 (2000). We have steadfastly adhered to this principle. Commonwealth v. Crews, 581 Pa. 45, 863 A.2d 498 (2004); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 580 Pa. 594, 863 A.2d 423 (2004); Commonwealth v. Howard, 567 Pa. 481, 788 A.2d 351 (2002). Accordingly, we must consider whether Appellant\u2019s claim is precluded by this line of reasoning.\nIn Gamboar-Taylor and subsequent cases, we addressed situations when PCRA counsel had allegedly ineffectively narrowed the class of claims raised by not including all of the viable claims in the first petition. In such instances, we concluded that by allowing the claim to go forward \u201cthe timeliness requirements crafted by the legislature would thus effectively be eviscerated by any petitioner who was willing to file serial PCRA petitions alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Howard, 788 A.2d at 355 (citing Gamboa-Taylor supra). Thus, we firmly rejected any such attempts \u201cto circumvent the one-year time limitation\u201d via claims of PCRA counsel ineffectiveness. Id. This interpretation is consistent with the federal constitutional standard guiding claims of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, which allow counsel to choose among nonfrivolous claims and select the best issues for purposes of appeal.\nThose cases, however, have no relevance when the claim emanates from the complete denial of counsel. Rather, in such instances, the United States Supreme Court mandates the presumption of prejudice because the process itself has been rendered \u201cpresumptively unreliable\u201d under the Sixth Amendment. See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 481-82, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000) (quoting United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984)). The Court has extended the presumptively prejudicial reasoning to the failure to appoint counsel for purposes of direct appeal. Penson v. Ohio, 488 U.S. 75, 88, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988). Likewise, the Court has declared that counsel\u2019s failure to file a requested notice of appeal was presumptively prejudicial. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. at 483, 120 S.Ct. 1029.\nConsistent with this jurisprudence, this Court has recognized a distinction between situations in which counsel has narrowed the ambit of appellate review by the claims he has raised or foregone versus those instances, as here, in which counsel has failed to file an appeal at all. Commonwealth v. Halley, 582 Pa. 164, 870 A.2d 795 (2005); Commonwealth v. Lantzy, 558 Pa. 214, 736 A.2d 564 (1999). To this end, we have repeatedly indicated that the failure to file a requested direct appeal or a 1925(b) statement in support thereof is the functional equivalent of having no counsel at all. Halley; Lantzy. In such instances, the deprivation requires a finding of prejudice. Id. Accordingly, following our prior case law, we hold that the analysis set forth in Gamboa-Taylor and subsequent case law does not apply to situations when counsel abandons his client for purposes of appeal. Additionally, allowing such claims to go forward would not eviscerate the time requirements crafted by the Legislature. Rather, subsection (b)(1)(h) is a limited extension of the one-year time requirement under circumstances when a petitioner has not had the review to which he was entitled due to a circumstance that was beyond his control.\nFurthermore, we believe that the Statutory Construction Act requires such a result. In addition to requiring us to interpret the language plainly, the Act requires that we employ the presumption that the General Assembly does not intend to violate the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922. While we have declared the PCRA to be constitutional generally, see Peterkin, this does not mean that it is constitutional as applied to all petitioners.\nThere is no federal constitutional mandate requiring collateral review. Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551, 556-57,107 S.Ct. 1990, 95 L.Ed.2d 539 (1987). It is not part of the criminal process, and is, in fact, civil in nature. Id. Therefore, under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the procedural due process protections are less stringent than for purposes of either a criminal trial or direct appeal. Id. Nevertheless, due process requires that the post conviction process be fundamentally fair. Id.; see also Commonwealth v. Haag, 570 Pa. 289, 809 A.2d 271, 283 (2002). Thus, petitioners must be given the opportunity for the presentation of claims at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner. See Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 437, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982).\nAs part of the PCRA process, indigent petitioners may apply for the assistance of counsel for purposes of their first PCRA petition. We have held this rule to be absolute inasmuch as we have concluded that a petitioner need not establish that his petition is timely before he or she is entitled to the appointment of counsel. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Smith, 572 Pa. 572, 818 A.2d 494 (2003). To this end, it can be assumed that the PCRA court will appoint appropriate counsel, i.e., counsel that can and will raise potentially meritorious claims. In this same vein, while the performance of PCRA counsel is not necessarily scrutinized under the Sixth Amendment, the performance of counsel must comply with some minimum norms, which would include not abandoning a client for purposes of appeal. See e.g., Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 554 Pa. 31, 720 A.2d 693 (1998); see also Pa.R.Crim.P. 904(F)(2) (providing for the appointment of counsel throughout post-conviction proceedings including any appeal). Accordingly, extending the decision in Gamboa-Taylor to situations when counsel abandons his client on direct appeal would raise serious questions of whether the process is \u201cfundamentally fair\u201d as applied to a certain class of petitioners.\nIn this case, Appellant alleges that his counsel abandoned him by failing to file an appellate brief. The record establishes that Appellant filed a pro se statement under Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) indicating a desire to appeal. It was then that counsel was appointed, but failed to file anything with the Superior Court. Accordingly, we hold that Appellant has made ' sufficient allegations that counsel abandoned him for purposes of his first PCRA appeal by failing to file an appellate brief and that Appellant\u2019s relief under subsection (b)(l)(ii) is not controlled by the Gamboa-Taylor line of case law.\nThus, as discussed previously, Appellant has made sufficient allegations to invoke subsection (b)(l)(ii). Appellant alleges that he did not receive the review to which he was entitled through no fault of his own. On appeal, Appellant was assigned counsel who could not raise the ineffectiveness claims he wanted to pursue. See Commonwealth v. Appel, 689 A.2d 891 (Pa.1997) (holding that counsel cannot raise his or her own ineffectiveness). Such an infirmity was compounded when counsel abandoned Appellant by failing to file an appellate brief in flagrant violation of Pa.R.Crim.P. 904(F)(2). In such an instance, Appellant must be given the opportunity to seek the review to which he or she was entitled.\nHaving concluded that Appellant\u2019s allegations bring his claim within the ambit of subsection (b)(1)(h), he must still prove that it meets the requirements therein. Under subsection (b)(1)(h), he must also prove that the facts were \u201cunknown\u201d to him and that he could not uncover them with the exercise of \u201cdue diligence.\u201d Such questions require further fact-finding and the PCRA court, acting as fact finder, should determine whether Appellant met the \u201cproof\u2019 requirement under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii).\nThe dissent by Justice Eakin points out that Appellant cannot establish that the facts were \u201cunknown\u201d to him as a matter of law under this court\u2019s decision in Chester, 557 Pa. 358, 733 A.2d 1242.\nIn Chester, petitioner filed a PCRA petition nearly 10 years after his conviction and argued that he had \u201cafter discovered evidence\u201d that his trial counsel was arrested for driving under the influence only days after entering his appearance on behalf of petitioner. Petitioner alleged that the arrest created a conflict of interest. In considering the petitioner\u2019s claim, we explained that just because the petitioner did not discover the evidence did not mean it was \u201cunknown\u201d to him for purposes of \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h). Instead, we held that information is not unknown to a PCRA petitioner when the information was a matter of public record. Id. at 523, 733 A.2d 1242.\nThe dissent concludes that Chester should control the instant case, since the Superior Court filed its order dismissing Appellant\u2019s appeal on August 14, 2000. An order dismissing an appeal is a matter of public record, and therefore, the dissent would hold that Appellant cannot meet \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(ii). Respectfully, we disagree since implicit in the decision in Chester was the recognition that the public record could be accessed by the defendant.\nWhile the dissenting opinion is attractive in its simplicity, it does not give due consideration to the circumstances the instant case raises. The August 14th order was a matter of \u201cpublic record\u201d only in the broadest sense. Such orders are not sent directly to the prisoner. Rather, counsel is sent the notice on the assumption that counsel will inform his client of the court\u2019s action. In a case such as the instant one, it is illogical to believe that a counsel that abandons his or her client for a requested appeal will inform his client that his case has been dismissed because of his own failures. More importantly, in light of the fact that counsel abandoned Appellant, we know of no other way in which a prisoner could access the \u201cpublic record.\u201d Rather, we believe this situation is sufficiently distinct from the situation in Chester, since in this case, the matter of \u201cpublic record\u201d does not appear to have been within Appellant\u2019s access.\nAccordingly, this matter is remanded to the Superior Court for remand to the PCRA court for further consideration consistent with this opinion.,\nJustice BAER, Justice BALDWIN and Justice FITZGERALD join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion in which Justice CASTILLE joins.\nJustice EAKIN files a dissenting opinion in which Justice CASTILLE joins.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9541 et seq.\n. The prior version of the PCRA did not place time limits on the filing of petitions.\n. Appellant's preservation of this issue throughout the proceedings involving his first PCRA petition is significant because the Superior Court ultimately granted a new trial as to the murder charge for co-defendant Wyatt due to the trial court\u2019s erroneous accomplice liability instruction. Commonwealth v. Wyatt, 2050 EDA 1999 (Pa.Super.Ct, July 16, 2001) (unpublished memorandum).\n. The other two alternatives are when the petition alleges and the petitioner proves that: the failure to raise the issue was a result of governmental interference or the right asserted was a constitutional right that was recognized by this Court or the United States Supreme Court and declared retroactive. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(i), (iii).\n. While this author concurred in the result in Hernandez and wrote separately on the issue discussed herein, the principle of stare decisis requires that the decision of the majority be followed here.\n. At the very least, it would appear that Appellant would be entitled to a remand to give him the opportunity to amend his petition to include this claim following our decision in Robinson. McGill supra. A remand would also be consistent with our decision in Commonwealth v. Williams, 566 Pa. 553, 782 A.2d 517 (2001), in which we provided for a remand in instances when the PCRA court did not provide a capital defendant with adequate pre-dismissal notice of its reasons for dismissal as required by Pa.R.Crim.P. 1509(c) (which is currently Rule 905).\nThe PCRA court properly followed a Williams-type process in Wharton when it issued a notice of intent to dismiss Wharton's petition, which was filed post -Robinson, on the basis that the petition was untimely and failed to assert an exception to the one-year time requirement. 886 A.2d at 1123. Consistent with Williams, Wharton was then given 20 days to amend his petition to include an exception to the one-year time requirement. Although ultimately, Wharton chose not to amend the petition and therefore, it was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, it is instructive that the PCRA court gave him the opportunity to amend his petition under Rule 905. In this case, because of the timing of this matter and the fact that the PCRA court automatically reinstated his appellate rights, Appellant has never been given the opportunity to amend his pleadings consistent with Williams.\n. Section 1928 addresses which statutes should be liberally or strictly construed. Subsection (b) enumerates the provisions that should be strictly construed, while subsection (c) provides that \"all other provisions\u201d should be liberally construed. While subsection (b) includes \"penal provisions\u201d as part of its enumerated list, the provisions contained in the PCRA are not a \"penal provision\u201d to be strictly construed, as it is merely the codification of the writ of habeas corpus. And, habeas corpus is characterized as a civil remedy. See Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963); see also Commonwealth ex rel. Marshall v. Gedney, 456 Pa. 570, 321 A.2d 641, 643 (1974) (rejecting appellant\u2019s argument that appellate jurisdiction in extradition-related cases should be exercise under the related \"criminal proceedings\u201d provision).\n. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Small, 559 Pa. 423, 741 A.2d 666, 673 (1999) (the requirements of an after discovered evidence claim include, in relevant part, that the new evidence is not to be used for merely cumulative or impeachment purposes, i.e., that it is exculpatory; and that the new evidence is of such a nature that it would compel a different outcome if it had been introduced at trial).\n. This refers to a claim brought under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), which challenges the Commonwealth's failure to produce material evidence. Specifically, a Brady claim requires a petitioner to show, \"(1) the prosecutor has suppressed evidence; (2) the evidence, whether exculpatory or impeaching, is helpful to the defendant; and (3) the suppression prejudiced the defendanl.\u201d Commonwealth v. Carson, 590 Pa. 501, 913 A.2d 220, 244 (2006).\n. While the Superior Court cites our decisions in Yarris and D\u2019Amato, neither of those decisions support the proposition for which they are cited. Specifically, the relevant portion of Yarris correctly analyzes subsection (b)(l)(ii) and concludes that the claim fails because the appellant did not make a sufficient proffer of why it took so long to present the claims, and therefore, did not show that he acted with due diligence. 731 A.2d at 590. Furthermore, any reliance on D\u2019Amato is misplaced, since the \u201cafter-discovered\" analysis discussed therein related to \u00a7 9543(b)(vi), which, as discussed above, tracks the language of the after discovered evidence exception.\n. The PCRA also provides that any exception set forth in subsection (b)(1)(h) must be plead within 60 days of when it \"could have been presented.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2). In this instance, we are content that Appellant has alleged that his petition was filed within 60 days of the date it could have been presented, since it was filed less than 25 days after when Appellant found out that the Superior Court dismissed his first PCRA appeal.\n. Many of the concerns raised in this case have been alleviated by the fact that the Superior Court has altered its practice and no longer dismisses such appeals \"without prejudice\u201d due to counsel's failure to file a brief. Rather, the court retains jurisdiction over the matter and remands for the appointment of new counsel. Accordingly, the situation raised herein should not occur with frequency.\nThis process, however, is informal. We take this opportunity to recommend that the Criminal Procedural Rules Committee and Appellate Court Procedural Rules Committee review the rules to determine whether the Superior Court\u2019s informal procedure should be formalized.\n. Of course, the PCRA court can examine this matter on remand.\n. Chester involved a \"public record\u201d extant at the time of trial during which counsel was actively representing his client. Clearly, that is distinct from a situation in which counsel has abandoned his client and yet counsel is the only way the client would have to access the information.\n. On a final note, we see no reason to appoint a new trial judge to these proceedings on remand, since there is nothing to suggest that the appointment of defense counsel as PCRA appellate counsel was anything more than an oversight. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Whitmore, 590 Pa. 376, 912 A.2d 827 (2006).\n. Finally, our decision in Robinson and subsequent case law, have no relevance to this case, since Robinson did not allege any of the exceptions to the one-year time limitation in his PCRA petition or before this Court. Robinson, 575 Pa. 500, 837 A.2d 1157 (2003). Rather, this case presents the first opportunity to examine the contours of subsection (b)(1)(h) under circumstances when PCRA counsel has abandoned his client."}
