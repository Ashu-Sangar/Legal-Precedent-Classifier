{"id": "1755454", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nOn August 26, 1977, Richard Wayne Rogers was convicted by a jury in Cambria County of two separate counts of robbery and of murder of the first degree. Following denial of post-verdict motions, a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed on the murder conviction. A prison sentence of ten to twenty years was imposed on each robbery conviction, these prison sentences to run concurrently with the life imprisonment sentence. This appeal followed.\nSeveral rulings of the trial court during the prosecution process are assigned as error. In view of our conclusion that the admission of certain photographic evidence was so prejudicial as to require a new trial, we need not reach or discuss every assignment of error.\nAt trial, the Commonwealth charged that, before leaving the scene of a coal weigh station where Rogers and two companions had committed a robbery, Rogers fatally shot the attendant of the station in the head with a shotgun as he sat injured and helpless on the snow-covered ground.\nAt trial, evidentiary use of four photographs, showing the dead body of the victim lying prostrate at the site of the fatal shooting, was permitted over objection. These photographs were also taken by the jury into the deliberation room and remained there throughout the jury\u2019s discussion of the case.\nOne of the challenged photographs (Exhibit 20) depicted in close and graphic detail the victim\u2019s distorted face, head wounds, and blood, flesh and brains scattered in the snow alongside the head. The gruesomeness and inflammatory nature of this photograph is patently obvious. It is clear to us that the use of this photograph denied Rogers a constitutionally required fair and objective determination of his guilt of the crimes charged. We will, therefore, reverse and order a retrial.\nWe recently set forth in Commonwealth v. Batty, 482 Pa. 173, 177, 393 A.2d 435, 437 (1978), the considerations to be made by the trial judge if an inflammatory photograph is offered as evidence for consideration by the jury:\n\u201cIf . [a] photograph is deemed to be inflammatory, the Court must then apply the balancing test . i. e., is the photograph of \u2018such essential evidentiary value that its need clearly outweighs the likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jurors.\u2019 \u201d [Emphasis, citations, and quotations omitted.]\nThe Commonwealth contends on appeal, as it did at trial, that the photograph in question was of such essential evidentiary value that its need clearly outweighed \u201cthe likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jury.\u201d Specifically, the Commonwealth contends the photograph was necessary: (1) to establish \u201cthe head of the victim was parallel and in close proximity to the ground when he was shot\u201d; and, (2) to support the Commonwealth\u2019s position that the shooting occurred after the robbery was accomplished and that, hence, its only purpose was the elimination of the victim as a possible witness against the robbers.\nA study of the trial testimony readily demonstrates: (1) that use of the photograph was wholly unnecessary to establish where the victim\u2019s body was located at the moment of the fatal shot and that the shooting occurred after the robbery occurred; and, (2) that there was a clear likelihood it would inflame the minds and passions of the jury.\nIt is true that Pennsylvania State Police Officer McCommons viewed the photograph at trial and then expressed the opinion that the victim\u2019s head was parallel and in close proximity to the ground when he was shot. But the officer did not need the photograph to so testify because he observed the body and its condition as it lie on the ground after the shooting. In fact, Officer McCommons, who took the challenged photograph, could have described what he saw without reference to the photograph and expressed his opinion on the basis of what he had observed. Additionally, one of Rogers\u2019 co-felons, Michael Noon, who testified as a Commonwealth witness, stated that the victim was seated on the ground, injured, and disabled immediately before he was fatally shot and that the shooting ensued after the robbery had succeeded.\nUnder the circumstances, the photograph was not of \u201cessential evidentiary value.\u201d\nJudgments reversed and a new trial is ordered.\nROBERTS and MANDERINO, JJ., filed concurring opinions.\nLARSEN, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. The jury fixed the penalty at death but the court, with the acquiescence of the district attorney, imposed a sentence of life imprisonment. Cf. Commonwealth v. Moody, 476 Pa. 223, 382 A.2d 442 (1977)."}
