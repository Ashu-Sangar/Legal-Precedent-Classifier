{"id": "1370904", "contents": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nJustice NEWMAN.\nWe must decide today whether an insurance company owes a duty to defend or indemnify a homeowner for the wrongful death of his houseguest occasioned by his selling heroin to her. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the holding of the Superior Court, albeit on different grounds, that no such obligation exists.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nAt 8 p.m. on February 9, 1998, eighteen year-old Angela Smith (Smith) arrived at the home of Michael J. Greenfield (Greenfield) at 600 North Third Street, in Wormleysburg, hoping to obtain some heroin from him. Another young woman, Brook Broadwater (Broadwater), was with Smith. When they arrived, Greenfield had been drinking Mad Dog beer and was under the influence of marijuana and heroin.\nGreenfield was no stranger to the use of heroin, having lost consciousness three times from it in the past. Original Record (Record), Deposition Testimony of Michael J. Greenfield, December 13, 2000 (Greenfield Deposition), at 120-21. He was using heroin on a daily basis. Id. at 147. He had used heroin with Smith before, and she, too, had become unconscious twice from it. Id. at 121-22. Greenfield had sold heroin to Smith on other occasions and was arrested in 1995 for possession of marijuana. Id. at 124. Greenfield acknowledged that he sold drugs out of his house \u201coccasionally;\u201d for the most part, he sold \u201cmostly just weed\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t really sell heroin to too many people.\u201d Id. at 141-42.\nIn exchange for some marijuana and a small sum of money, Greenfield provided Smith with a bag of heroin, which was labeled \u201cSuicide.\u201d At approximately 8:20 p.m., Smith voluntarily injected herself with the heroin. From that time until 10 p.m., Smith lay in a chair and communicated only when directly addressed. Greenfield put out some blankets for her, and she went to sleep on the floor. Greenfield left with Broadwater, returning to the house approximately 10:45 p.m. Id. at 131. Smith remained in the residence, and when Greenfield awoke around 6:30 a.m., he found Smith still on the floor. Id. at 132. When he left for work, he told Smith to lock the door if she left, and Smith groggily responded. Id.\nWhen Greenfield came home from work later that day, he found Smith dead on the floor where he had left her that morning. Greenfield knew that she was dead because \u201cshe was pale and not breathing.\u201d Id. at 145. Autopsy results showed that Smith died from a heroin overdose. Greenfield called a friend, Robert Rollins (Rollins), who came to his residence. Id. at 147. Wearing gloves because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to touch\u201d Smith\u2019s dead body, Greenfield, with his friend, took the body and put it in a vehicle owned by Greenfield. Id. at 148. They drove around the area, and then dumped the body in York County near the Yellow Breeches Creek. Id. at 257. Greenfield then contacted the police and concocted a story to the effect that he had simply found a body near the creek. Rollins initially told the same story, but recanted and told the truth. The men were arrested later that same day.\nGreenfield was charged criminally for the outcome of the death of Smith; he pled guilty and was sentenced on counts of involuntary manslaughter, abuse of a corpse, and unlawful delivery of heroin. During the guilty plea colloquy, counsel stated that the maximum penalty on the felony charge (unlawful delivery of Schedule I controlled substance) is five years and $15,000.00; for the misdemeanor one (involuntary manslaughter), it is five years and fine; and for the misdemeanor two (abuse of corpse), it is two years and fine. Record at 77-78. Also during the colloquy, counsel indicated that Greenfield had been confined in York County prison (the county in which the body was found) and then sent to Cumberland County prison. When he was on bail in York County, the charges there were dropped, and he was arrested on Cumberland County charges. Record at 82. At the deposition, Greenfield stated that he made bail, (he testified that \u201cI think it was $25,000.00\u201d at first and then \u201cthey raised it to $200,000.00\u201d) and then he pled guilty and went back to jail, with two more incarcerations. Record at 155-56. Outside of these sketchy references, the Record does not contain other evidence regarding the sentence.\nGreenfield obtained a homeowner\u2019s policy (the Policy) from Minnesota Fire and Casualty Company (Insurance Company) when he purchased his residence. This was the Policy in place when Smith died, and it provided as follows:\nSection II, Coverage E\u2014Personal Liability\nIf a claim is made or a suit is brought against an insured for damages because of bodily injury or property damage caused by an occurrence to which this coverage applies, we-will:\n1. pay up to our limit of liability for the damages for which the insured is legally liable; and\n2. provide a defense at our expense by counsel of our choice, even if the suit is groundless, false or fraudulent. We may investigate and settle any claim or suit that we decide is appropriate. Our duty to settle or defend ends when the amount we pay for damages resulting from the occurrence equals our limit of liability.\nRecord, Exhibit B at 31.\nThe Policy defines \u201coccurrence\u201d as \u201can accident,\u201d including exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy period, in: a. bodily injury; or b. property damage. Record, Exhibit B at 22. \u201cBodily injury\u201d is \u201cbodily harm, sickness or disease, including required care, loss of services and death that result.\u201d Id. However, the Policy excludes coverage for bodily injury \u201cwhich is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d Record, Exhibit B at 32. Bodily injury \u201carising out of business pursuits of an insured\u201d is also excluded. Id. \u201cBusiness\u201d is defined as a \u201ctrade, profession or occupation.\u201d Record, Exhibit B at 22.\nOn June 10, 1999, Sharon L. Smith and Arlin C. Smith, the parents of Smith, filed wrongful death and survival actions against Greenfield in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (trial court), individually and on behalf of all the other beneficiaries of the Estate of Angela C. Smith, as administrators of that Estate. They alleged, inter alia, that: (1) Greenfield had sold heroin to Smith; (2) he knew of, or should have foreseen, the harmful and dangerous consequences of selling heroin to Smith; (3) he made no attempts to check on her condition during the evening of February 8,1998, and the following morning; and (4) he made no attempt to revive her, instead, leaving her and going to work.\nThe Insurance Company filed a Declaratory Judgment Action in the trial court, claiming, inter alia, that:\nThe allegations of the Smith Complaint do not trigger an obligation on the part of Minnesota Fire and Casualty to either defend or indemnify [Greenfield] for the allegations of liability set forth herein. The damages sought in the Smith Complaint are alleged to have been caused by the sale of heroin by Greenfield to [Smith] resulting in [Smith\u2019s] death. These allegations do not constitute \u201can occurrence,\u201d i.e., an accidental event; rather the allegations are premised solely upon the intentional and criminal act of the insured of selling heroin, a controlled substance.\nComplaint in Equity\u2014Declaratory Judgment Action, \u00b6 12.\nThe Insurance Company further alleged that it had no legal obligation to defend or indemnify Greenfield on the ground that public policy bars the insurance coverage asserted. Complaint in Equity\u2014Declaratory Judgment Action, \u00b6 19.\nOn March 14, 2001, the trial court ruled on the parties' Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, which sought summary judgment regarding a duty of the Insurance Company to defend and indemnify Greenfield in the wrongful death and survival action. Our Court held in General Accident Insurance Co. of America v. Allen, 547 Pa. 693, 692 A.2d 1089, 1095 (1997), that \u201c[i]f the complaint ... avers facts that would support a recovery covered under the policy, then coverage is triggered and the insurer has a duty to defend until such time that the claim is confined to a recovery that the policy does not cover.\u201d Based on its application of Allen, the trial court ordered the Insurance Company to defend the case and sustain any ultimate liability. Opinion of the Trial Court at page 2. The court cited United Services Automobile Association v. Elitzky, 358 Pa.Super. 362, 517 A.2d 982 (1986), petition for allowance of appeal denied, 515 Pa, 600, 601, 528 A.2d 957 (1987), which involved a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy with an exclusionary clause identical to the one presently before the Court; i.e., it did not cover liability for bodily injury \u201cwhich is expected or intended by the insured.\u201d In Elitzky, the court stated that \u201cthe exclusionary clause applies only when the insured intends to cause a harm. Insurance coverage is not excluded because the insured\u2019s actions are intentional unless he also intended the resultant damage.\u201d Id. at 987. Relying on that, the trial court in the case sub judice found that although the Complaint alleged an intentional act by Greenfield, i.e., supplying heroin to Smith, there were no averments alleging or reasonably inferring that Greenfield expected or intended to cause her death. With respect to the duty to defend and indemnify, the trial court cited Mutual Benefit Insurance Company v. Haver, 555 Pa. 534, 725 A.2d 743 (1999), which noted that \u201c[t]he particular cause of action that a complainant pleads is not determinative of whether coverage has been triggered. Instead it is necessary to look at the factual allegations contained in the complaint.\u201d Id. at 745. Finding that the Complaint alleged negligence and contained no averments that Greenfield intended to cause the death of Smith, the trial court held that the Insurance Company had the duty to defend him in the wrongful death and survival action until it could confine the claim to a recovery not within the scope of the Policy.\nThe Opinion and Order of the trial court denied the Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, applying the standard of review that requires it to \u201cview, the record in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact must be resolved against the moving party.\u201d Opinion and Order of the Trial Court at 9-10 (citing Washington v. Baxter, 553 Pa. 434, 719 A.2d 733 (1998)). The court found that the record \u201cdoes not, as a matter of law, show that the Smiths\u2019 claim is excluded under Minnesota\u2019s policy.\u201d Id. at 10. The trial court, however,'did not grant the Smiths\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment on the issue of indemnification, finding that the Insurance Company was required to defend Greenfield until the claim could be confined to a recovery that was not within the scope of the Policy.\nThe Superior Court reversed and determined that two factors precluded coverage: (1) its expanded doctrine of \u201cinferred intent,\u201d which had been applied previously in Pennsylvania only to cases involving child abuse. Minnesota Fire and Casualty Company v. Greenfield, 805 A.2d 622 (Pa.Super.2002); and (2) public policy. The court noted \u201ccompelling public policy reasons\u201d to deny coverage, for, \u201c[i]n effect, the courts are being asked to help provide insurance for heroin dealers----[T]he legislature ... has already determined the inherent danger of heroin.... It should not be the public policy ... to insure the sale of such a ... dangerous and illegal narcotic....\u201d Id. at 630.\nRelying on Aetna Casualty and Surety Company v. Roe, 437 Pa.Super. 414, 650 A.2d 94 (1994), which adopted in Pennsylvania the idea of inferred intent in child abuse cases, the Superior Court in the instant matter stated that \u201c[inferred intent results when there is an intentional act on the part of the insured and it is inherent in that act that harm will occur. In child abuse cases, the actor\u2019s abuse will frequently cause long-term harm to the child.\u201d Greenfield, 805 A.2d at 624. Reasoning that it was frequently certain that harm would occur to the buyer of heroin, the Superior Court extended the doctrine of inferred intent, vacated the trial court Order, and remanded with instructions to enter an Order holding that the Insurance Company had no duty either to defend or to indemnify Greenfield. Judge Olszewski dissented, rejecting the extension by the majority of the concept of inferred intent, noting that the doctrine was intended only for \u201cexceptional cases involving sexual child abuse.Id. at 631 (internal citations omitted).\nGreenfield filed a Petition for Allowance of Appeal with this Court, raising one issue, which was whether the Superior Court erred in extending the concept of inferred intent to cases involving general liability insurance coverage. \u25a0 We granted allocatur on April 22, 2003. For the reasons that follow, we determine that although the Superior Court erred in expanding the inferred intent doctrine, it reached the correct result in determining that public policy precludes the Insurance Company from any duty to defend or indemnify Greenfield.\nDISCUSSION\nAs we explained, the question before us is whether the Insurance Company must defend or indemnify Greenfield for the wrongful death of Smith resulting from heroin that he sold to her.\nIn this case, the Insurance Company filed a declaratory judgment action, which the trial court addressed pursuant to Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment filed by both parties. The court denied the Insurance Company\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, granted the Motion of the defendants regarding the Insurance Company\u2019s duty to defend Greenfield, and denied the defendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment seeking indemnification of Greenfield by the Insurance Company. Our scope of review of an order granting summary judgment is plenary, and we will reverse the order of a trial court only where the court committed an error of law or clearly abused its discretion. Atcovitz v. Gulph Mills Tennis Club, Inc., 571 Pa. 580, 812 A.2d 1218 (2002). When reviewing an order granting summary judgment, \u201c[t]he reviewing court must view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, resolving all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact against the moving party.\u201d Id. at 1221 (internal citations omitted).\nThe interpretation of an insurance contract regarding the existence or non-existence of coverage is \u201cgenerally performed by the court.\u201d Allen, 692 A.2d at 1093. \u201cWhere a provision of a policy is ambiguous, the policy provision is to be construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer.... Where, however, the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, a court is required to give effect to that language.\u201d Gene & Harvey Builders, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Manufacturers\u2019 Association Insurance Company, 512 Pa. 420, 517 A.2d 910, 913 (1986). In light of the fact that the appropriate construction of the Policy poses a question of law, our standard of review is plenary. Sahutsky v. H.H. Knoebel Sons, 566 Pa. 593, 782 A.2d 996 (2001).\nBased on our analysis, we conclude that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it found that the Insurance Company is required to defend Greenfield and when it held that public policy does not prohibit insurance coverage for the death of Smith. We reject the Superior Court\u2019s extension of the doctrine of inferred intent to general liability insurance matters as inappropriate and unnecessary to the resolution of this case. We agree with the result that the Superior Court reached in reversing the trial court; however, we affirm only that part of its holding that determines that public policy precludes coverage under the Policy.\nThe Superior Court asserted two reasons for reversing the trial court: (1) Greenfield intentionally supplied Smith with the heroin that caused her death and, although he may not have intended her death, the known risks of heroin use make an adverse reaction an \u201cexpected occurrence;\u201d and (2) \u201c[i]t should not be the public policy of this Commonwealth to insure the sale of such a notoriously dangerous and illegal narcotic, limited only by an express clause denying such coverage.\u201d Greenfield, 805 A.2d at 626, 630.\nWe will address only the issues that the parties raised, although there appears to be an argument based on contract interpretation that the Insurance Company did not advance.\nThe Superior Court and the Insurance Company focused their analyses on that part of the Policy that excludes coverage for injuries that are \u201cexpected or intended by the insured.\u201d The question concerning whether Greenfield \u201cexpected or intended\u201d Smith to die when he provided her with heroin is certainly difficult to answer, as reflected by the fact that the trial court and the Superior Court came to opposite conclusions. The trial court found that the averred facts support that the death of Smith was caused by the negligence of Greenfield; and the Superior Court inferred that \u201can intent to cause injury existed as a matter of law due to ... Greenfield\u2019s providing Angela Smith with what ... all too predictably, proved to be a fatal dose of heroin.\u201d Greenfield, 805 A.2d at 624.\nWhen this Court first considered the effect of a similar exclusionary clause in a homeowner\u2019s policy, we stated that \u201cthe vast majority of courts which have considered such a provision [an exclusionary clause] have reached the conclusion that before the insurer may validly disclaim liability, it must be shown that the insured intended by his act to produce the damage which did in fact occur.\u201d Eisenman v. Hornberger, 438 Pa. 46, 264 A.2d 673-74 (1970) (internal citations omitted). We emphasized in that case the difference between intending an act and intending a result. In Eisenman, we held that the exclusionary clause did not preclude coverage for damages caused by a house fire during the course of a burglary. Further, we found that although the perpetrators intended to burglarize the house, they did not anticip\u00e1te or plan. the resulting house fire occasioned by their use of matches to light their way in the dark.\nThe trial court found that \u201cthe facts averred support Smiths\u2019 allegation that the death of Angela Smith was caused by Greenfield\u2019s negligence.\u201d Opinion and Order of the Trial Court at 5. It is in the context of this jurisprudential background that the Superior Court extended and applied the doctrine of inferred intent, presumably for the reason that it was unable to establish actual intent, given the absence of allegations that Greenfield expected or intended Smith to lose consciousness or die. The earlier ruling of the Superior Court in Elitzky, which involved an identical exclusionary clause, was consistent with our articulation of the standard in Eisenman. \u201cAn insured will only be covered if he causes a harm of a generally different type than that which he set out to cause.\u201d Elitzky, 517 A.2d at 988. The harm that occurred in the case sub judice is exactly the type of evil inherent in the use of heroin. Sometimes, users are fortunate and suffer no ill effects; other times, they lose consciousness; in the worst of all scenarios, they die.\nThe Superior Court stated that \u201cthe notion of inferred intent is accepted in Pennsylvania,\u201d Greenfield, 805 A.2d at 625; however, the concept has not been extended beyond child sexual abuse cases. \u201cIn adjudicating general liability insurance cases, as opposed to . those exceptional cases involving child sexual abuse, Pennsylvania courts presently follow [Elitzky].\u201d Wiley v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., 995 F.2d 457, 461 (3d Cir.1993) (emphasis added). Wiley noted the very narrow applicability of inferred intent and stated that \u201cin cases that do not involve child sexual abuse, Pennsylvania has adopted a general liability standard for determining the existence of this specific intent that looks to the insured\u2019s actual subjective intent.\u201d Id. at 460.\nJurisprudence in Pennsylvania does not support the extension of inferred intent to cases other than exceptional ones involving child sexual abuse. Although this Court is not bound by the precedent established in a subsequent diversity case based on the law of Pennsylvania, we note that the Third Circuit has refused to extend the doctrine of inferred intent to preclude coverage for harm suffered by a female college student after a sexual assault by the homeowner\u2019s son. In Aetna Life and Casualty Company v. Barthelemy, 33 F.3d 189 (3d Cir.1994), the homeowner\u2019s policy contained an exclusionary clause identical to the one in the case sub judice. The Aetna policy excluded from personal liability and coverage \u201cbodily injury or property damage ... which is expected or intended by any insured.... \u201d Id. at 191. The court stated that:\nPennsylvania case law teaches us how to begin an analysis of exclusionary clauses of the type contained in the Barthelemy\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy:\nIn our state, the exclusionary clause applies only when the insured intends to cause a harm. Insurance coverage is not excluded because the insured\u2019s actions are intentional unless he also intended the resultant damage. The exclusion is inapplicable even if the insured should reasonably have foreseen the injury which his actions caused. Elitzky, 517 A.2d at 987 (citation omitted). The homeowner\u2019s policy in this case excluded bodily injury or property damage which is expected or intended by any insured.\n* * *\nAlthough Elitzky mandates a subjective intent analysis for determining coverage under an exclusionary clause in most Pennsylvania insurance cases, a different analysis is applied in those exceptional cases involving sexual child abuse. Wiley, 995 F.2d at 460. In those exceptional cases, many jurisdictions have adopted what is called the inferred intent rule: This rule allows a court to infer an actor\u2019s intent from the nature and character of his or her acts and to establish conclusively the existence of intent to harm as a matter of law. Id. This presumption is conclusive \u2018notwithstanding the insured\u2019s assertion of an absence of subjective intent to harm. Id. Intent may be inferred only if the degree of certainty that the conduct will cause injury is sufficiently great to justify inferring intent to injure as a matter of law.... [T]he more likely harm is to result from certain intentional conduct, the more likely intent to harm may be inferred as a matter of law.\u2019 Id. at 462 (internal quotation omitted).\n* * *\nInferring intent to harm is strong medicine. We noted in Wiley that it has narrow applicability. Id. We cautioned repeatedly that, in cases that do not involve sexual child abuse, Pennsylvania has adopted a general liability standard for determining the existence of this specific intent that looks to the insured\u2019s actual subjective intent. Id. at 460.\nBarthelemy, 33 F.3d at 191-92. As in Barthelemy, there are specific differences between the facts before this Court and those in Wiley: (1) in Wiley, the victim was a child; (2) in Wiley, there was no contention that the victim had consented; and (3) in Wiley, both participants were not intoxicated. Reiterating that the \u201centire discussion in Wiley was limited to sexual assault on a child[,]\u201d the Third Circuit held that with respect to inferring intent, \u201c[wjhere a child is not a participant in the act, there is no reason for the rule.\u201d Barthelemy, 33 F.3d at 193. In the case before us, neither Greenfield nor Smith was a child. Each acted voluntarily in a transaction that the laws of this Commonwealth criminalize: Greenfield sold the heroin, and Smith injected it.\nThe incursion by the Superior Court into the territory of inferred intent was unnecessary with respect to reaching a determination of non-coverage. If it had followed its own analysis in Germantown Insurance Company v. Martin, 407 Pa.Super. 326, 595 A.2d 1172 (1991), petition for allowance of appeal denied, 531 Pa. 646, 612 A.2d 985 (1992), it would have arrived at the same place without the detour. In that case, an insured went on a shooting spree, killing several occupants of a house. The court held that there was no coverage pursuant to the perpetrator\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy for the reason that the conduct of shooting was intentional and, in applying the Elitzky standard, the conduct was excluded under the policy \u201cas it is exactly the type of injury against which insurance companies are not and should not be expected to insure.\u201d Id. at 1175. The court found no evidence that the shooting was \u201caccidental or negligent\u201d and also determined it irrelevant that the insured did not know the identity of one of the victims or that the victim was present in the house. Further, the court held that notwithstanding its finding that coverage was excluded under the terms of the policy, \u201cwe would also find coverage excluded as violative of the public policy of Pennsylvania.\u201d Id. \u201cThe courts of Pennsylvania have refused to require an insurer to defend an insured for his own intentional torts and/or criminal acts.\u201d Id. (internal citations omitted). Based on this and the facts in the case sub judice, there is no coverage under the Policy given that Greenfield and Smith were voluntary participants in a criminal transaction involving heroin, a Schedule I controlled substance, that directly caused Smith\u2019s death.\nWe cannot know with certainty what Greenfield\u2019s state of mind was, a fact neither necessary to nor dispositive of our decision. We do ratify existing principles of our jurisprudence and, by doing so, we reject the Superior Court\u2019s extension of inferred intent, which established, as a matter of law, that Greenfield intended the harm that befell Smith.\nHaving said that, however, the Superior Court\u2019s determination that the Insurance Company is not required to defend or indemnify under the Policy is correct. In addition to applying an expanded inferred intent doctrine, the court based its determination on the \u201ccompelling public policy reasons for denying a claim such as this [where, i]n effect, the courts are being asked to help provide insurance for heroin dealers.\u201d Greenfield, 805 A.2d at 630. The court reiterated that heroin is a Schedule I controlled substance, and that its sale and possession for use or delivery are illegal. The court cited the many reasons for the illegality of heroin, including its \u201cinherent harm ... [and] not only the harm caused to society in terms of costs and quality of life, but the real and devastating harm done to the user.\u201d Id. at 627.\nIn Eisenman, we rejected an argument that allowing recovery pursuant to an insurance policy where property damage arose out of the commission of a crime by the insured would contravene public policy. We did so for two reasons: (1) the insurance contract itself did not contain a \u201cviolation of law\u201d clause; and (2) our analysis that \u201cunder the facts of this case, we are not confronted with any overriding public policy which would preclude recovery.\u201d Eisenman, 264 A.2d at 675.\nOur decision in that case determined that an insurance company was required to indemnify against losses caused by a carelessly lit match that was dropped when teenagers were burglarizing a home. We supported our holding on two bases: (1) the widely accepted principle that \u201cbefore the insurer may validly disclaim liability, it must be shown that the insured intended by his act to produce the damage which did in fact occur[;]\u201d and (2) the absence of any \u201coverriding public policy\u201d to preclude recovery. Eisenman, 264 A.2d at 674-75 (internal citation omitted).\nUsing our analysis in the case at bar, and providing further refinement of our thirty-four year-old holding in Eisenman, we find that recovery is precluded for damages that arise out of an insured\u2019s criminal acts regarding a Schedule I substance, as a matter of overriding public policy. Therefore, in situations when an insured commits a criminal act, with respect to a Schedule I controlled substance, and unintended or unexpected injuries or losses occur as a result, whether by accident or negligence, public policy will not allow coverage under the contract of insurance.\nHowever, in cases that do not involve a criminal act by an insured with respect to a Schedule I controlled substance, our decision in Eisenman, reiterating the test traditionally required for an insurer to disclaim liability; i.e. the insurer must prove that the insured intended by his act to produce the damage which did actually occur, retains its validity.\nThe Court in Eisenman was distressed at the lack of a violation of law clause in the insurance policy there. It is obvious that a homeowner\u2019s policy is not designed to protect a drug dealer from personal liability for supplying heroin that results in the death of his houseguest. \u201cOnly dominant public policy\u201d justifies the invalidating of a contract on the basis of public policy, and one such indication of that policy is \u201cstatutory enactments.\u201d Burstein v. Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company, 570 Pa. 177, 809 A.2d 204, 207 (internal citations omitted). If the explicit criminalization of use or possession or sale of drugs that have a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the United States, and lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision does not manifest convincing proof of public interest, what would? While we were \u201cloath to insert [a \u2018violation of law\u2019] clause for the greater protection of the insurer\u201d in Eisenman, public policy demands that we do so now and in every case where a loss has arisen from the insured\u2019s commission of a crime involving the sale, use, or possession of a Schedule I controlled substance. Id. at 675.\nWe reviewed another liability policy with a similar exclusionary clause in Haver, where an insured pharmacist distributed medication without prescriptions. The insurance policy explicitly excluded coverage for \u201cbodily injury or property damage whether or not expected or intended by the insured, which is a consequence of an insured\u2019s willful harm or knowing endangerment.\u201d Haver, 725 A.2d at 745. An argument was made that the policy was ambiguous because it contained, in conjunction with the exclusionary language, an endorsement that provided coverage for \u201cprofessional liability,\u201d including \u201cmalpractice.\u201d Id. at 746. We rejected that contention, holding that\nany ambiguity arising from the use of the term malpractice in the endorsement, as a result of the potentially evil or illegal connotation that might be attributable to that term, is illusory, since it would be against the public policy of this Commonwealth to permit a carrier to offer insurance for damages assessed as a result of evil or illegal conduct.\nId. at 747 (emphasis added). This Court determined that the insurance company was not required to indemnify the pharmacist, stating that \u201c[w]e believe that it was beyond the contemplation of the parties that the policy would cover a pharmacist who continuously dispenses drugs to an individual without a prescription despite advice to the contrary from the individual\u2019s personal physician.\u201d Id. at 747 n. 3. Given this determination with respect to drugs that could be prescribed legally in the appropriate circumstances, there is no doubt that the. Policy in the case sub judice is not intended to cover sales of heroin.\nSalient facts in Haver are sadly analogous to the ones regarding Greenfield and Smith. In that case, the victim who participated in the illegal drug transaction was a substance abuser who had dealt with the pharmacist previously, and her conduct, as well as that of the pharmacist, was illegal. While we do not wish to diminish the pain and horror that result from the death of an eighteen-year-old from heroin, the record reflects that she and Greenfield had a history of trading drugs with each other since 1994 and that she came to the home of Greenfield seeking heroin on the night of her death. Similar to the victim in Haver, Smith was a willing participant in a criminal transaction.\n\u201cOnly in the clearest cases, therefore, may a court make an alleged public policy the basis of judicial decision.\u201d Hall v. Amica Mutual Insurance Company, 538 Pa. 337, 648 A.2d 755, 760 (1994) (quoting Mamlin v. Genoe, 340 Pa. 320, 17 A.2d 407, 409 (1941)). Regardless of whether the insurance contract listed the possession, use and sale of heroin as an exclusion, the fact is that the legislature has criminalized the conduct that resulted in the damages in the instant matter. This exemplifies the clearest of cases.\nMoreover, the Insurance Company argued that public policy prohibits indemnification under the Policy, citing, among other statutes, the Controlled Substances Act, which criminalizes the possession, use, or transfer of heroin as a felony violation infringing upon public health, safety, morals, and welfare. Brief of Appellee at 22. This comports with our requirement that\nA Plaintiff must do more than show a possible violation of a statute that implicates only her own personal interest. The Plaintiff in some way must allege that some public policy of this Commonwealth is implicated, undermined, or violated because of the employer\u2019s termination of the employee. Public policy of the Commonwealth must be just that, the policy of the Commonwealth.\nMcLaughlin v. Gastrointestinal Specialists, Inc., 561 Pa. 307, 750 A.2d 283, 289 (2000).\nOur Commonwealth, from the legislature to the Secretary of Health, has made its policy on the illegality of heroin abundantly clear: \u201cheroin has a high potential for abuse, has no accepted medical use within the United States, and ... is unsafe for use even under medical supervision.\u201d Greenfield, 805 A.2d at 627.\nGiven this clear enunciation of public policy regarding Schedule I controlled substances, we find that the Insurance Company is not required to defend or indemnify against damages arising out of its insured\u2019s criminal acts where the voluntary participation of the victim in an illegal heroin-transaction caused her death.\nCONCLUSION\nThe public policy in our Commonwealth, as articulated by the legislature, is clear: possession, sale, and use of heroin are illegal. Public policy does not allow recovery under an insurance contract where a willing and frequent participant in this type of criminalized activity dies as a result. This is true regardless of whether the victim intended to die or whether the criminal intended the death, for we will not countenance the turning of illegal activities regarding Schedule I controlled substances into money-making occasions. Although we reject the reasoning of the Superior Court that extended the doctrine of inferred intent to general liability policies, we affirm the Order of the Superior Court based on its articulation of public policy.\nFormer Justice LAMB did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustice CASTILLE files a concurring opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\nChief Justice CAPPY files a dissenting opinion in which Justice NIGRO joins.\n. Heroin is a Schedule I controlled substance, pursuant to The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 1972, April 14, P.L. 233, No. 64, \u00a7 1, eff. June 14, 1972, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-101 et seq. (The Controlled Substance Act). A Schedule I controlled substance is one with \u201ca high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision.\u201d 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-104(1).\n. Ironically, when Greenfield arrived home from work, the police chief was outside of his door because Greenfield had a broken headlight, and the chief \u201cwas checking to make sure [that he] fixed it.\u201d The police chief did not know that Smith was dead inside the house, and when Greenfield discovered her body, he did not call the police, explaining that he was scared \"[b]ecause of drugs, being high and stuff. I didn't know what to do.\u201d Id. at 145-46. In reviewing the entire Record, there is not one scintilla of evidence to suggest that Greenfield felt remorse or personal responsibility for the death of Smith. He seems to have little conscience or regret for what transpired.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2504.' Involuntary manslaughter\n(a) General rule.\u2014A person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when as a direct result of the doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person.\n(b) Grading.\u2014Involuntary manslaughter is a misdemeanor of the first degree. Where the victim is under 12 years of age and is in the care, custody or control of the person who caused the death, involuntary manslaughter is a felony of the second degree.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5510 provides that \"[e]xcept as authorized by law, a person who treats a corpse in a way that he knows would outrage ordinary family sensibilities commits a misdemeanor of the second degree.\u201d\n. 35 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) provides that \"[t]he following acts and the causing thereof within the Commonwealth are hereby prohibited: ... the manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance by a person not registered under this act....\u201d\n. Mr. Justice Castille articulates in his Concurring Opinion that it would be preferable to resolve this matter by principles of contract construction. He notes that the definition of \"occurrence\u201d in the Policy requires an \u201caccident,\" and that the heroin transaction between Greenfield and Smith was not an accident. Although his argument is appealing, the fact is that Greenfield sought allowance of appeal on only one issue, which was the alleged error of the Superior Court in extending the doctrine of inferred intent to this matter. The Court on appeal considers only questions set forth in the Petition. Pa.R.A.P. 1115(a)(3). Further, what could have been a relatively simple case of contract interpretation has been complicated unnecessarily by the failure of the Insurance Company to advance in an adequate manner an argument that the death of Smith was not an occurrence because it was not an accident. The parties and the Superior Court focused on whether or not Greenfield intended the death of Smith. However, the Superior Court and the Insurance Company have overlooked this key determinant of coverage cited by Mr. Justice Castille.\nIt initially appeared from the Declaratory Judgment Action that the Insurance Company would be making this argument, when it stated that:\nThe allegations of the Smith Complaint do not trigger an obligation on the part of Minnesota Fire and Casualty to either defend or indemnify [Greenfield] for the allegations of liability set forth therein. The damages sought in the Smith Complaint are alleged to have been caused by the sale of heroin by Greenfield to the decedent resulting in the decedent\u2019s death. These allegations do not constitute \"an occurrence,\u201d i.e., an accidental event; rather, the allegations are premised solely upon the intentional and criminal act of the insured of selling heroin, a controlled substance.\nComplaint in Equity-Declaratory Judgment Action, 1112. However, the Insurance Company failed to brief the position that there is no occurrence if there is no accident; instead, it relied on the language in the exclusions section that the death was not \"expected or intended by the insured.\u201d\nThis Court has held before that an occurrence requires an accidental event. See Gene\u2019s Restaurant, Inc. v. Nationwide Insurance Company, 519 Pa. 306, 548 A.2d 246 (1988) (where a willful and malicious assault of a restaurant patron was not an occurrence, because the policy defined \u201coccurrence\u201d as an \"accident.\u201d In a footnote we stated that the \"[r]estaurant argues that because it neither 'expected' nor 'intended' [the victim\u2019s] injuries, [the insurance company] had a duty to defend. Such a reading ignores the policy requisite that the 'occurrence' must be an accident which a malicious, willful assault and beating could never be.\u201d Id. at 247 n. 1).\nIndeed, maintaining the posture of an \u201caccident\u201d successfully may well have proved impossible, given that the bag of heroin provided to Smith was labeled \"Suicide,\u201d and that Greenfield testified that he had witnessed Smith lose consciousness from heroin on at least two other occasions. Clearly, the victim had visited the brink of disaster in the past; her death did not occur in a vacuum. Further, in the case sub judice, Greenfield pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter. \"A person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when as a direct result of the doing of an unlawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner ... he causes the death of another person.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2504(a). By pleading to this charge, Greenfield acknowledged that the death of Smith was the \"direct result\u201d of his \"unlawful act.\u201d\n. The Policy provides for certain other exclusions, as well, which are not relevant to the instant appeal. Record, Exhibit B at 32.\n. We stated that \u201cthe question is not whether the dropping of the m\u00e1tches was an \u2018intentional act,\u2019 but rather whether the resulting property damage was 'intentionally caused\u2019 by the insured.\u201d Eisenman, 264 A.2d at 674.\n. In Wiley, the adult perpetrator was intoxicated; there is no evidence even suggesting that the child victim was intoxicated.\n. The Superior Court gave an incorrect citation for the Controlled Substance Act. Heroin is listed at Schedule I at 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-104(l)(ii)(10).\n35 P.S. \u00a7 780\u2014104(1 )(ii)( 10) (emphasis added).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508(a)(7) provides that:\nA person who is convicted of violating section 13(a)(14), (30) or (37) of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act where the controlled substance or a mixture containing it is heroin shall, upon conviction, be sentenced as set forth in this paragraph:\n(i) when the aggregate weight of the compound or mixture containing the heroin involved is at least 1.0 gram but less than 5.0 grams the sentence shall be a mandatory minimum term of two years in prison and a fine of $5,000 or such larger amount as is sufficient to exhaust the assets utilized in and the proceeds from the illegal activity; however, if at the time of sentencing the defendant has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense: a mandatory minimum term of three years in prison and $10,000 or such larger amount as is sufficient to exhaust the assets utilized in and the proceeds from the illegal activity;\n(ii) when the aggregate weight of the compound or mixture containing the heroin involved is at least 5.0 grams but less than 50 grams; a mandatory minimum term of three years in prison and a fine of $15,000 or such larger amount as is sufficient to exhaust the assets utilized in and the proceeds from the illegal activity; however, if at the time of sentencing the defendant has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense: a mandatory minimum term of five years in prison and $30,000 or such larger amount as is sufficient to exhaust the assets utilized in and the proceeds from the illegal activity; and\n(iii) when the aggregate weight of the compound or mixture containing the heroin involved is 50 grams or greater: a mandatory minimum term of five years in prison and a fine of $25,000 or such larger amount as is sufficient to exhaust the assets utilized in and the proceeds from the illegal activity; however, if at the time of sentencing the defendant has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense: a mandatory minimum term of seven years in prison and $50,000 or such larger amount as is sufficient to exhaust the assets utilized in and the proceeds from the illegal activity.\n. The dissent wrongly casts the majority into the role of a \"super-scrivener,\u201d based on our holding that damages arising from an insured\u2019s criminal acts are excluded, even when the specific crimes are not listed by name in the policy. Dissenting Opinion at 363, 855 A.2d at 872. This view fails to recognize that it is the legislature that has acted as scrivener, by criminalizing specific acts, one of which is the possession, use, or sale of heroin. Although the Insurance Company may reap a benefit from our holding, this alone cannot allow the Court to lend its efforts to require reimbursement for damages arising out of the conduct of a policyholder that our legislature has defined as illegal.\n. When this Court interprets an insurance policy, it is our duty to \u201cascertain the intent of the parties as manifested by the language of the written agreement.\u201d Haver, 725 A.2d at 746 (quoting Standard Venetian Blind Company, 503 Pa. 300, 469 A.2d 563, 566 (1983)). Greenfield bought the Policy because the lender required it to purchase the home. Record, Exhibit H, Deposition Testimony of Michael J. Greenfield, December 13, 2000 (Deposition) at 119. Greenfield also testified that the purpose of a prior renter\u2019s policy he purchased for an earlier residence was to cover things that were stolen. Record, Exhibit H, Deposition at 115. No party has argued that Greenfield purchased the Policy to insure against injuries or death occasioned by heroin. Further, as noted by Mr. Justice Saylor in his Concurring Opinion, \u201cit cannot be reasonably maintained that the parties to the insurance contract anticipated that the homeowner\u2019s involvement in the drug overdose of another would give rise to a covered risk.\u201d Concurring Opinion at 360, 855 A.2d at 871 (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 178(2)(a) providing that, in weighing the enforcement of a contractual provision in connection with public policy grounds, the parties' justifiable expectations must be considered). As the Insurance Company explains, \"homeowners insurance policies were not designed to protect drug dealers from personal liability arising from the sale of illegal and lethal drugs.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 25.\n. Two earlier decisions of this Court are helpful with respect to our analysis of public policy. In BLaST Intermediate Unit 17 v. CNA Insurance Companies, 544 Pa. 66, 674 A.2d 687 (1996), we held that public policy did not relieve the duty of an insurer to indemnify its insured (BLaST) for the insured\u2019s negligent but good faith violation of the federal equal pay statute. BLaST sought indemnification for damages it had to pay female teachers\u2019 aides as a result of its violation of the Equal Pay Act. We determined that there was no legitimate public policy reason to disallow a loss caused by a negligent statutory violation. Id. at 691. We distinguished our holding in BLaST from our earlier determination in Central Dauphin School District v. American Casualty Company, 493 Pa. 254, 426 A.2d 94 (1981). In Central Dauphin, the School District sought to recover from its insurance carrier monies it was required to return to taxpayers as a result of an illegal tax it had levied on them. We stated in BLaST that while \"BLaST\u2019s statutory violation can not be condoned ... it does not raise the same public policy concerns as the Central Dauphin School District\u2019s unlawful taxing measure.\" BLaST, 674 A.2d at 690. Regarding the unlawful tax collections that the Central Dauphin School District imposed, we emphasized in BLaST that it\nwas never entitled to revenue from the taxes. Clearly, there was no loss to the school board; rather, the school board would have realized a windfall if allowed to collect from its insurance carrier after refunding the taxes. It was obviously against public policy to allow the school district to use unlawful activity as a money-making endeavor.\nId.\nThe facts in the instant case are analogous to the ones in Central Dauphin, not BLaST. Greenfield and Smith engaged in an illegal transaction resulting, regrettably, in the death of Smith. Unlike the situation in BLaST, there is no such thing as a \"good faith\u201d violation of a criminal law when it comes to heroin. There is no circumstance in which the use or sale of the drug is anything other than a criminal act. To require the Insurance Company to indemnify against damages in a wrongful death and survival action would be to allow the use of a criminal activity as a basis upon which to make money. As we said in Central Dauphin, this would contravene public policy.\n. In Haver, I wrote a concurring opinion joined by then Chief Justice Flaherty to express my opinion that \"regardless of the averments in the complaint or the language of the policy of insurance, it is against public policy to allow insurance coverage for an illegal drug transaction.\" Id. at.748.\n. This case involved a challenge to an employer's termination of an at-will employee, rather than a contract. The Plaintiff argued that public policy prohibited her discharge allegedly as a result of her claims of OSHA violations."}
