{"id": "1759059", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellants, the Hospital Association of Pennsylvania and twenty-one Pennsylvania hospitals, contend that state regulations governing \u201cgeneral and special hospitals,\u201d 28 Pa.Code \u00a7\u00a7 101.1 et seq., were promulgated without statutory authority by appellees, the Secretary and the Department of Health. We agree with appellees and the Commonwealth Court that ample basis for the challenged regulations is provided by article IX of the Public Welfare Code. Accordingly, we affirm.\nI\nIn 1972, appellees determined that the department\u2019s \u201cRules and Regulations for Hospitals,\u201d last revised in 1966, should again be revised. In full compliance with publication and notice requirements, appellees published a set of proposed rules and regulations designed to replace the 1966 rules. 2 Pa.Bull. 1129 (1972). Between 1972 and 1977, appellees evaluated extensive public opinion on the proposed rules, including comment from the Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, and incorporated many suggestions into a revised draft. Again by proper notice, appellees published a revised set of rules and regulations. 7 Pa.Bull. 939 (1977). After further public comment, appellees modified the proposed rules and, in December, 1977, adopted them as modified. 7 Pa.Bull. 3631 (1977).\nThe challenged regulations span twenty-six chapters, ranging from such concerns as \u201cGovernance and Management\u201d to \u201cConstruction Standards.\u201d Within each chapter there are a series of specific regulations. For example, under the heading \u201cGovernance and Management,\u201d there appear regulations setting objectives for hospital by-laws, 28 Pa.Code \u00a7 103.3, establishing functions to be performed by a \u201cgoverning body,\u201d id. at \u00a7 103.4, and directing formation of various \u201cgoverning body committees.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 103.6. Also included are regulations establishing a \u201cPatient\u2019s Bill of Rights,\u201d id. at \u00a7\u00a7 103.21-103.24, managerial and administrative responsibilities, id. at \u00a7\u00a7 103.31-103.39, and standards for fiscal control. Id. at \u00a7\u00a7 103.41-103.46. In all, appellees promulgated over 500 specific regulations.\nBefore the effective date of the regulations, appellants filed a petition for review in the Commonwealth Court, alleging that appellees lacked statutory authority to promulgate the challenged rules and regulations. On appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the Commonwealth Court sustained the regulations and denied appellants relief. This appeal followed.\nII\nSection 902 of the Public Welfare Code expressly provides that the department shall have \u201csupervision\u201d over a number of facilities, including, under subsection (8), \u201c[a]ll institutions for adults within this Commonwealth.\u201d Appellants concede, as they must, that \u201cgeneral and special hospitals\u201d \u201care institutions for adults.\u201d They dispute, however, the scope of appellees\u2019 power of \u201csupervision.\u201d Appellants claim they possess \u201cmanagerial prerogatives\u201d which may not be regulated by appellees.\nThe Public Welfare Code does not define the department\u2019s \u201csupervisory powers\u201d under section 902. Nevertheless, our review of the Code must recognize that \u201c[substantive rule-making is a widely used administrative practice, and its use should be upheld whenever the statutory delegation can reasonably be construed to authorize it.\u201d Bernard Schwartz, Administrative Law \u00a7 56 at p. 151 (1976). As Dean Freedman points out, \u201c[t]he existence of a body of standards tends to encourage greater deliberations, self-consciousness, and consistency in the exercise of administrative discretions and thereby reduces the likelihood that an agency will act arbitrarily.\u201d James 0. Freedman, Crisis and Legitimacy: The Administrative Process and American Government 245 (1978). We are satisfied that, reasonably construed, the Public Welfare Code demonstrates that the Legislature fully intended to permit the department (A) to supervise hospitals\u2019 managerial practices and (B) to do so through promulgation of rules and regulations.\nA\nNowhere in article IX of the Code. is \u201cmanagerial prerogative\u201d reserved. Compare Public Employe Relations Act, Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, \u00a7 702, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.702 (Supp.1979) (\u201c[p]ublic employers shall not be required to bargain over matters of inherent managerial policy\u201d). Rather, hospital administration is expressly within the purview of existing departmental regulatory obligations. Surely it cannot seriously be disputed that proper, uniform managerial practices promote the quality and efficiency of the delivery of health care services to individual consumers requiring health care. It is precisely this goal which the Legislature requires the department to achieve. Section 921(c) of the Code, fully applicable to hospitals, expressly directs the department to set \u201cstandards for the safe and adequate care of individuals,\u201d making \u201cadequate and proper provision[] for . (x) humane care.\u201d\nThat managerial practices of hospitals are within the legislatively-defined competency of the department under section 921 is demonstrated by an analogous provision of article IX. Section 911 of the Code expressly contemplates the department\u2019s review of the managerial practices of \u201csupervised institutions.\u201d Under section 911(a)(2), the Legislature places \u201call and every matter and thing\u201d relating to the \u201cusefulness, administration, and management\u201d of \u201csupervised institutions,\u201d and \u201cto the welfare of the inmates thereof . . . ,\u201d within the department\u2019s mandatory obligation of \u201cinquir[y] and examin[ation.]\u201d Indeed, \u201csupervised institutions,\u201d by definition, expressly includes \u201call hospitals, almshouses, or poor houses, maintained by any county, city, borough, township or poor district of this Commonwealth.\u201d We are convinced, therefore, that the Legislature has given the tribunal with experience and expertise over managerial practices of \u201csupervised institutions\u201d similar authority to supervise the managerial practices of hospitals subject to departmental standards under section 921.\nB\nWe are also satisfied that section 902 of the Code authorizes the department to supervise managerial practices of hospitals through promulgation of \u201crules and regulations.\u201d No provision of article IX expressly confers authority upon the department to establish \u201crules and regulations\u201d governing hospitals. Rather, under section 921(c), the department is required to establish \u201cstandards.\u201d Nonetheless, in discussing the appropriate means of enforcing these mandatory \u201cstandards,\u201d the Legislature clearly contemplates departmental \u201crules and regulations\u201d affecting hospitals. Section 921(e) provides:\n\u201cWhenever the department shall upon inspection, investigation or complaint find any violation in any institution of rules or regulations adopted by the department, or any failure to establish, provide or maintain standards and facilities required by this act or by the department, it shall give immediate written notice thereof, to the officer or officers charged by law with or in any way having or exercising the control, government or management of such institution, to correct the said objectionable condition in the manner and within the time specified by the department; whereupon, it shall be the duty of such officer or officers to comply with the direction of the department. If such officer or officers fail to comply with such direction, the department may request the Department of Justice to institute appropriate legal proceedings to enforce compliance therewith, and the department may withhold any State money available for such institution until such officer or officers comply with such direction.\u201d (emphasis added)\nSection 921(e) could contemplate \u201crules and regulations adopted by the department\u201d only if some other provision of the Code grants the department authority. It must be remembered that \u201c[ejvery statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). To \u201cgive effect\u201d both to the department\u2019s supervisory power under section 902 and the language \u201crules and regulations\u201d found in section 921(e), it must be concluded that the department is empowered, under its power of \u201csupervision,\u201d to formulate \u201crules and regulations.\u201d\nIll\nFor all the above reasons, none of the regulations appellants have challenged, including those affecting governance, establishing a \u201cPatient\u2019s Bill of Rights,\u201d and setting appropriate considerations for admissions,' can realistically be viewed as beyond the reach of departmental authority conferred under section 902. Accordingly, we hold that the Legislature has authorized the department to promulgate its rules and regulations concerning hospitals. We therefore affirm the decree of the Commonwealth Court denying appellants injunctive relief.\nDecree affirmed. Each party pays own costs.\nFLAHERTY, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which LARSEN, J., joins.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\n.

The Commonwealth Court granted the preliminary injunction, but later dissolved it upon granting appellees summary judgment.\n. This Court granted appellants a stay pending appeal. In view of our disposition, this stay, of course, is vacated.\n. Section 902 provides:\n\u201cSupervisory powers\nThe department shall have supervision over:\n(1) All State institutions;\n(2) All supervised institutions;\n(3) All children\u2019s institutions within this Commonwealth;\n(4) All maternity homes and hospitals within this Commonwealth;\n(5) Any labor or system of labor carried on in the penal, correctional or reformatory institutions of the State;\n(6) Any system of reparation provided by the Commonwealth for relief from conditions caused by mine-caves, fire, flood, or other casualty, and constituting a menace to public safety and welfare;\n(7) All boarding homes for children which have been licensed by the State;\n(8) All institutions for adults within this Commonwealth.\u201d\nThe \u201cdepartment\u201d refers to the Department of Public Welfare. See Public Welfare Code of 1967, \u00a7 102 (definitions). By \u201cReorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973,\u201d P.L. 457, 71 P.S. \u00a7 755-2 (Supp.1979), the Legislature transferred to the Department of Health the \u201cfunctions, powers and duties of the Department of Public Welfare with regard to the supervision and licensing of general and special hospitals, as set forth in Articles 9 and 10 of [\u2018The Public Welfare Code.\u2019]\u201d\n. See \u201cAppendix \u2018B\u2019 to Brief for Appellants\u201d at \u201cB-33.\u201d Section 901 of the Public Welfare Code of 1967 defines an \u201cinstitution for adults\u201d as follows:\n\u201c \u2018Institution for Adults\u2019 means any incorporated or unincorporated public or private organization, society or association including any agency of a county, county institution district or municipality which provides for food, shelter and some service to adults, or which provides rehabilitation, training, guidance or counselling to the blind or visually handicapped, or to the physically or mentally handicapped, including but limited to the following: homes for the aged and infirm, nursing homes, convalescent homes, placement agencies for adults, general and special hospitals and institutions for mentally ill and defective adults, rehabilitation centers having living-in arrangements, workshops and facilities for the rehabilitation of the visually, mentally or physically handicapped, and all organizations for the prevention of blindness.\u201d\nSee also supra note 6 (quoting \u201cReorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973\u201d).\n. See Public Welfare Code, \u00a7 921(b) (\u201chospitals\u201d expressly enumerated as \u201cinstitutions\u201d subject to departmental standards).\n. Section 911(a)(2) requires the department:\n\u201cTo visit and inspect, at least once in each year, all state and supervised institutions; to inquire and examine into their methods of instruction, discipline, detention, care or treatment, the care, treatment, government or management of their inmates or those committed thereto, or being detained, treated or residing therein, the official conduct of their inspectors, trustees, managers, directors or other officer or officers charged with their management by law or otherwise, or having the management, care, custody or control thereof, the buildings, grounds, premises, and equipment thereof, or connected therewith, and all and every matter and thing relating to their usefulness, administration, and management, and to the welfare of the inmates thereof, or those committed thereto or being detained, treated or residing therein.\u201d\n. One other consideration, overlooked by appellants, confirms our conclusion that appellees possess authority under sections 911 and 921 to regulate hospitals\u2019 managerial practices. Were appellants to prevail in their attack upon the challenged regulations, at least portions of appellees\u2019 \u201cRules and Regulations for Hospitals\u201d promulgated in 1966, including those relating to hospital governance and the like, would be vulnerable to similar criticism. The Legislature, however, in codifying the above provisions in the Public Welfare Code of 1967, made no effort to disturb appellees\u2019 1966 regulations. It is established that administrative interpretations, not disturbed by the Legislature, are appropriate guides to legislative intent. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(8). We think it a fair corollary that the Legislature\u2019s failure in 1967 in any respect to disturb appellees\u2019 exercise of rule-making authority in 1966 evinces legislative recognition of appellees\u2019 regulatory authority over \u201cmanagerial prerogative.\u201d\n. We do not pass upon the reasonableness of any particular regulation. We hold only that appellees possess statutory authority to promulgate the challenged regulations. Cf. Girard School District v. Pittenger, 481 Pa. 91, 392 A.2d 261 (1978) (upholding regulations of State Board of Education, but not reaching reasonableness of any particular regulation)."}
