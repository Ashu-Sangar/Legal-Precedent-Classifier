{"id": "1299520", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Cohen,\nThe Borough of Lansdale, appellant, sought a declaratory judgment in the court below to assert its exclusive right under the authority of The Borough Code, to sell electricity in an area recently annexed by the Borough but presently serviced by the Philadelphia Electric Company ('Company), appellee.\nThe lower court dismissed the petition on the grounds that jurisdiction of the subject matter is vested solely in the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, and the Borough appealed.\nIt is unquestioned that the Public Utility Law gives the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC) exclusive and comprehensive regulatory jurisdiction over appellee\u2019s activities. On the other hand it is readily acknowledged that a borough, to the exclusion of the PUC, has jurisdiction over its own electric service when confined within the borough\u2019s boundaries. In fact, The Borough Code prohibits the introduction of electric current into the Borough without the consent of the Borough authorities. The PUC, however, has jurisdiction over any portion of the Borough\u2019s service which extends beyond the limits of the Borough.\nThe problem here is to determine whether a utility which has been granted a certificate of public convenience by the PUC for the rendition of electricity in an area may, without prior approval of the PUC, be required by decree of the court of common pleas to abandon or surrender that service because the area was recently annexed by a borough.\nAlthough we still possess the right of judicial scrutiny over the acts of the PUC, no principle has become more firmly established in Pennsylvania law than that the courts will not originally adjudicate matters within the jurisdiction of the PUC. Initial jurisdiction in matters concerning the relationship between public utilities and the public is in the PUC \u2014 not in the courts. It has been so held involving rates, service, rules of service, extension and expansion, hazard to public safety due to use of utility facilities, installation of utility facilities, location of utility facilities, obtaining, alerting, dissolving, abandoning, selling or transferring any right, power, privilege, service, franchise or property and rights to serve particular territory.\nThe Public Utility Law requires a certificate of public convenience to be obtained before any public utility can dissolve, abandon, surrender, in whole or in part, any service, or transfer by any method whatsoever any tangible or intangible property used in the public service. Nevertheless, the Borough desires a court to initially determine whether the appellee must dissolve, abandon, sell, transfer or discontinue its already obtained franchise privilege to render service in this newly annexed area. Our courts do not possess the jurisdiction to make such a determination.\nAlthough the Borough is armed with the provisions of The Borough 'Code, it can only effectuate its purpose by initially proceeding before the PUC. The Public Utility Law contemplates such procedures by providing that: \u201cThe commission, or any person, corporation or municipal corporation Raving an interest in tbe subject matter, or any public utility concerned, may complain in writing, setting, forth any act or thing done or omitted to be done by any public utility in violation, or claimed violation, of any law which the commission has. jurisdiction to administer, or of any regulation or. order of the commission. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied) Initial jurisdiction over the instant controversy. is vested in the PITO. and the available administrative remedies .must be resorted to.before the courts can. exercise their power of review.\nOrder affirmed.\nAct of May 4, 1927, P.
