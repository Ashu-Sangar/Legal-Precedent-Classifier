{"id": "1924331", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nIn this action for specific performance of a contract for the conveyance of real estate, the parties stipulated that the only issue involved is whether the wife-appellee was a party to the agreement. The chancellor determined that she signed as a witness rather than a party and the record adequately supports this finding.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.\nMr. Justice Roberts dissents and would grant specific performance against the appellee-wife on the grounds that the record clearly establishes that she acknowledged and ratified the written contract for the sale of the property."}
