{"id": "1159029", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nDefendant appeals from judgment for plaintiff on statutory demurrer in a suit on an insurance policy, dated August 10, 1926. The regular death benefits of $3,000 have been paid; this suit is for an additional $3,000 on the provision for \u201cDouble Indemnity in Case of Death from Accident.\u201d\nThe insured, Francis It. Ehle, as the statement avers, \u201clost his life as a result of bodily injuries caused solely by accidental means on the 5th day of November, 1931, in a crash of an aeroplane maintained and operated by the Ludington Line, a corporation engaged in the transportation, by air, of passengers for hire during a regularly scheduled flight of said aeroplane between Newark, New Jersey, and Camden, New Jersey, and while the said Francis R. Ehle was traveling in said aeroplane as a passenger for hire, in connection with the conduct of his business as President of the International Resistance Company, a corporation engaged in the business of manufacturing and distributing radio filament.\u201d\nDefendant relies on a portion of the provision for double indemnity, exempting it from double liability, if \u201cdeath shall ensue within 90 days from the date of such injuries and shall......be the result of or be caused di-\nrectly or indirectly by self-destruction, sane or insane, disease or illness of any kind, physical or mental infirmity, any violation of law by the Insured, military or naval service of any kind in time of war or by engaging as a passenger or otherwise in submarine or aeronautic expeditions.\u201d V: \u25a0 '\nWas the insured\u2019s death within the exception \u201cshall be the result of or be caused directly or indirectly by ......engaging as a passenger or otherwise in...... aeronautic expeditions\u201d?\nThere is no difficulty in understanding many forms of activity that would be included in the words \u201cengaging ......in submarine or aeronautic expeditions,\u201d but traveling as a passenger would not, at first sight, seem to be such an engagement, and, where the question has arisen, it has been decided that an airplane passenger is not considered to be so \u201cengaged\u201d: Benefit Assn. Ry. Employees v. Hayden, 175 Ark. 565, 299 S. W. 995 (1927); Peters v. Prudential Ins. Co., 133 Misc. 780, 233 N. Y. Supp. 500 (1929); Masonic Accident Ins. Co. v. Jackson, 200 Ind. 472, 164 N. E. 628 (1929); Gits v. New York Life Ins. Co., 32 Fed. (2d) 7 (1929); Price v. Prudential Ins. Co., 98 Fla. 1044, 124 So. 817 (1929); Flanders v. Benefit Assn., 226 Mo. App. 143, 42 S. W. (2d series) 973 (1931).\nAppellant agrees that the phrases \u201cengaged in aviation\u201d and \u201cengaged in aeronautics\u201d .and similar expressions have been held not to include one who was a passenger, but the brief suggests that \u201cthe words \u2018as a passenger\u2019 were inserted [in the policy] therefore to remove this doubt; but by adding the words \u2018or otherwise,\u2019 the expression became equivalent to \u2018anybody or everybody.\u2019 \u201d It may first be asked, if the purpose was to except passengers, why a clause simply excepting accident while a passenger in an aeroplane was not inserted? The difficulty is not so much with the words \u201cpassenger or otherwise\u201d as with the equivocal context \u201cengaging..... in submarine or aeronautic expeditions.\u201d The insured, when killed, was no more engaged in an expedition, in the common or normal sense of the word, than if he had been a passenger on a train or bus. A passenger engaged in an aeronautic expedition would seem to be one having some part in the conduct and operation of the expedition. On the other hand, if \u201cengaging as a passenger\u201d was intended merely to describe persons who would be regarded as passengers within the ordinary meaning of that word, without having any part in the conduct of the aeronautic expedition, the phrase was not well chosen. Certainly, as the word is generally defined, a passenger takes no part in the operation of the vehicle in which he is carried. So far as appears, the parties used the words in their commonly understood sense and so intended them to measure their obligation.\nAppellant notes that, in 1926, aviation was extremely hazardous and not generally recognized as a method of transporting passengers, and suggests that the parties for that reason intended to include in the words \u201caeronautical expeditions\u201d all flights by airplane; that is, that all travel by airplane in the conditions then existing would be excepted, because any flight might, perhaps, be considered an \u201cexpedition.\u201d In spite of that arbitrary understanding, if conditions change and travel by airplane is no longer subject to the extraordinary hazard which once made a flight an expedition, the exception cannot be held to have been intended to apply. \u201cThe contract is still to be interpreted according to its true intent, although altered conditions may have varied the form of fulfilment\u201d: Virginia v. West Virginia, 238 U. S. 202, 236; American Car & Foundry Co. v. East Jordan Furnace Co., 275 Fed. 786.\nBoth parties quote dictionaries in support of the particular meaning each would attribute to controlling words. But, no special circumstances appearing, the parties must be held to have used the words \u2014 ordinary words \u2014 in their ordinarily accepted meaning: Restatement, Contracts, section 235 (a). As to that meaning there is no doubt. The assured was a passenger, but he was not engaged in an aeronautic expedition. With these views we can, of course, not follow Gibbs v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc., 256 N. Y. 208.\nIf, however, we accepted the essential part of appellant\u2019s argument, we should still he required to affirm the judgment on the ground that equivocal words (they only become so by appellant\u2019s argument) must be taken against the insurer: Frick v. United Firemen\u2019s Ins. Co., 218 Pa. 409, 67 A. 743; Restatement, Contracts, section 236 (d).\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Maxey dissents.\nA stipulation was filed agreeing that \u201cthe action of the court in overruling the demurrer shall be treated as final for purposes of appeal, and no affidavit on the facts shall be filed.\u201d"}
