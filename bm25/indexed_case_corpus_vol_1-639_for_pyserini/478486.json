{"id": "478486", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Manderino,\nThe issue in this appeal is whether the appellee, Rosenbloom Finance Corporation, may elect to be taxed as a holding company and thus pay less Pennsylvania corporate franchise tax. The Board of Finance and Review resettled appellee\u2019s reported franchise tax for the year 1963. The resulting tax was $25,972.03. In an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County sitting as the Commonwealth Court, appellee raised two issues: (1) whether the valuation of appellee\u2019s capital stock was proper, and (2) whether the appellee was a holding company and thus entitled to a reduced tax rate.\nThe first issue was decided in favor of the Commonwealth and is not raised in this appeal. The second issue was also initially decided in favor of the Commonwealth. The appellee, however, filed exceptions which were sustained. The exceptions were sustained because the Commonwealth Court held that our decision in Commonwealth v. Alcoa Properties, Inc., 440 Pa. 42, 269 A.2d 748 (1970), decided after appellee filed its exceptions, mandated a conclusion that the appellee was a holding company. The Commonwealth Court thus ordered that the Commonwealth establish a credit in favor of the appellee in the amount of $25,666.83. From that order the Commonwealth has appealed.\nUnder the corporate franchise tax law, a corporation may elect to be taxed as a holding company, and thus pay a lower tax rate, if the electing corporation meets two criteria of the statutory definition of holding company which is as follows: \u201cThe term \u2018holding company\u2019 shall mean any corporation (i) at least ninety percent of the gross income of which for the taxable year is derived from dividends, interest, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities and the rendition of management and administrative services to subsidiary corporations, and (ii) at least sixty percent of the actual value of the total assets of which consist of stock, securities or indebtedness of subsidiary corporations.\u201d Act of June 1, 1889, P. L. 420, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a71871 (e) (replaced by Act of March 4, 1971, P. L. 6, No. 2, art. VI, \u00a7602, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a77602(f)).\nIn this case we are involved with part (ii) of the definition. The issue is whether, in part (ii), the phrase \u201cof subsidiary corporations\u201d modifies the immediately preceding phrase \u201cof stock, securities, or indebtedness\u201d or whether it modifies only the immediately preceding word \u201cindebtedness.\u201d If the phrase \u201cof subsidiary corporations\u201d modifies the phrase \u201cof stock, securities or indebtedness,\u201d a corporation\u2019s assets consisting \u201cof stock, securities\u201d in non-subsidiary corporations should not be considered in determining the necessary sixty percent requirement of part (ii). If, however, the phrase \u201cof subsidiary corporations\u201d modifies only the word \u201cindebtedness\u201d a corporation\u2019s assets consisting \u201cof stock, securities\u201d of any corporation\u2014 not necessarily a subsidiary corporation \u2014 should be considered. In this case, sixty percent of the actual value of appellee\u2019s total assets does not consist \u201cof stock, securities\u201d of a subsidiary corporation but does consist \u201cof stock, securities\u201d of non-subsidiary corporations.\nAppellee argues that our decision in Alcoa Properties controls the issue now before us. We do not agree. This case and Alcoa Properties both concern the statutory definition of holding company, but not the same part of that definition. In Alcoa Properties, we were concerned with part (i) of the definition. We concluded that the phrase \u201cto subsidiary corporations\u201d in part (i) modified only the phrase \u201cthe rendition of management and administrative services,\u201d and not the phrase \u201cfrom dividends, interest, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities.\u201d We reached that conclusion because any other result would have distorted the \u201cclear language of the Act.\u201d This case involves not part (i) but part (ii) of the definition. In Alcoa Properties, part (ii) of the definition was not an issue because the parties agreed that \u201cover 60% of the actual value of Alcoa\u2019s total assets [consisted] of the stock of three subsidiary corporations,\u201d 440 Pa. at 44, 269 A.2d at 749 (emphasis added).\nAppellee argues that it satisfies the criterion of part (ii) because sixty percent of the total value of its assets consists of stock and securities, even though the stock and securities are not those of subsidiary corporations. Appellee would have us read part (ii) as though the following italicized words had been inserted into the definition: \u201cAt least sixty percent of the actual value of the total assets of which consists of stock of any corporations, securities of any corporations or indebtedness of subsidiary corporations.\u201d We cannot accept the appellee\u2019s meaning of part (ii). We do not find any ambiguity in the language \u201cof stock, securities or indebtedness of subsidiary corporations.\u201d Without any strain on the rules of grammar or any deviation from common and approved usage, the language of part (ii) means that the \u201cstock\u201d and \u201csecurities\u201d mentioned as well as the \u201cindebtedness\u201d mentioned, must be \u201cof subsidiary corporations.\u201d See Statutory Con struction Act, 1 Pa. S. \u00a71903. The phrase \u201cof subsidiary corporations\u201d modifies \u201cof stock, securities or indebtedness.\u201d\nThe appellee argues that we should utilize the rule of the last antecedent, a grammatical rule which is sometimes an aid in construing legislation. According to the appellee, the rule requires that the phrase \u201cof subsidiary corporations\u201d modify only the word \u201cindebtedness.\u201d Sutherland\u2019s Statutory Construction gives the following explanation of the last antecedent rule: \u201cReferential and qualifying words and phrases, where no contrary intention appears, refer solely to the last antecedent, which consists of \u2018the last word, phrase, or clause that can be made an antecedent without impairing the meaning of the sentence.\u2019 Thus a proviso usually is construed to apply to the provision or clause immediately preceding it. The rule is but another aid to discovery of intent or meaning, however, and not an inflexible and uniformly binding rule. Where the sense of the entire act requires that a qualifying word or phrase apply to several preceding or even succeeding sections, the word or phrase will not be restricted to its immediate antecedent.\u201d C. Sands, 2A Sutherland\u2019s Statutory Construction \u00a747.33 (4th ed. 1973). The last antecedent rule may sometimes be helpful but it is not applicable to all cases. \u201cWhen several words are followed by a [modifying phrase] which is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the [modifying phrase] be read as applicable to all.\u201d Porto Rico Railway, Light & Power Co. v. Mor, 253 U.S. 345, 348, 64 L.Ed 944, 946, 40 S. Ct. 516, 518 (1920); see United States v. Bass, 404 U.S. 336, 30 L.Ed.2d 488, 92 S. Ct. 515 (1971); Buscaglia v. Bowie, 139 F.2d 294 (1st Cir. 1943); Morris v. Glen Alden Coal Co., 136 Pa. Superior Ct. 132, 7 A.2d 126 (1939); 50 Am. Jur. Statutes \u00a7269 (1944). In the statute in this case we have a phrase containing several words \u201cstocks,\u201d \u201csecurities\u201d and \u201cindebtedness,\u201d which are followed by the modifying phrase \u201cof subsidiary corporations.\u201d The modifying phrase \u201cof subsidiary corporations\u201d is \u201capplicable as much\u201d to the words \u201cstocks\u201d and \u201csecurities\u201d as it is to the word \u201cindebtedness.\u201d The natural construction of part (ii), therefore, requires that the modifying phrase be read as applicable to all the words in the preceding phrase.\nAppellee has also called our attention to a legislative revision of part (ii) of the statutory definition of holding company which was proposed in the General Assembly in 1967. That revision would have changed part (ii) to read \u201cat least sixty percent of the average actual value of the total assets of which consist of investments in subsidiary corporations in the form of stock, securities or indebtedness.\u201d The bill proposing the revision was never reported out of committee. The failure of the legislative committee to report on the proposed revision does not indicate that the appellee\u2019s interpretation of the existing definition is correct. The proposed revision was not to change the law but was to \u201cfurther clarify and define holding companies.\u201d Since the purpose was to serve as a clarification of the existing language, we cannot infer any intent to change the existing meaning of the law. The legislative committee may have concluded that there was no need to clarify part (ii) of the definition.\nWe have considered other grammatical arguments raising issues of punctuation and grammar, but we have found none of these persuasive. Since at least sixty percent of the total value of appellee\u2019s assets does not consist \u201cof stock, securities or indebtedness of subsidiary corporations,\u201d it is not a holding company and thus does not qualify for a lower tax rate.\nJudgment vacated and matter remanded to the Commonwealth Court for the entry of an appropriate judgment consistent with this opinion."}
