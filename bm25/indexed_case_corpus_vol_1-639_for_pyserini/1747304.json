{"id": "1747304", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nThis appeal is from a final decree entered in the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Franklin County. The final decree involuntarily terminated the parental rights of appellant, Joseph M. S., Jr. The facts are as follows.\nIn August, 1974, a child, Baby Girl M., was born out of wedlock to Lois M. and appellant. At the time of the child\u2019s birth, Lois was nineteen and appellant was seventeen. Four days after her birth, Baby Girl M. was placed by Lois M. with the Children\u2019s Aid Society of Franklin County (the Agency) for purposes of adoption.\nSubsequently, a petition was filed for the voluntary relinquishment of the parental rights of Lois M. joined by the Agency. A hearing was scheduled for October 29, 1974. Since appellant had refused to accept a letter sent to him by certified mail notifying him of the hearing, the court directed that appellant be personally served with notice of the hearing by the sheriff of Franklin County. Appellant was served the following day. Further, since appellant was a juvenile at the time the court ordered that his mother be appointed guardian ad litem.\nA hearing was then held on November 13, 1974. Appellant testified that he did not wish to voluntarily relinquish his parental rights. The hearing was then continued to allow the Agency to file a petition for the involuntary termination of appellant\u2019s parental rights. The petition was filed and a hearing was held on December 16,1974. Because of the death of one of the court reporters, the record of the proceedings was not transcribed until early 1976. A final hearing on the matter was held on April 15, 1976.\nOn August 19, 1976, the hearing judge filed a decree nisi which ordered the involuntary termination of appellant\u2019s parental rights. Exceptions were filed and denied by the final decree of January 4, 1977. This direct appeal followed.\nThe Adoption Act provides:\n\u201cThe rights of a parent in regard to a child may be terminated after a petition filed pursuant to section 312, and a hearing held pursuant to section 313, on the ground that:\n4! }{: Sf! }\u00a1\u00ed S\u00bbS %\n\u201c(2) The repeated and continued incapacity, abuse, neglect, or refusal of the parent has caused the child to be without essential parental care, control, or subsistence necessary for his physical or mental well-being and the conditions and causes of the incapacity, abuse, neglect, or refusal cannot or will not be remedied by the parent.\u201d Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, No. 208, art. Ill, \u00a7 311,1 P. S. \u00a7 311 (Supp. 1978-79).\nI. Scope of Review\nIn the case of In Re Adoption of McAhren, 460 Pa. 63, 70, 331 A.2d 419, 422 (1975), we stated:\n\u201cIt is well established that, in view of the irreversible nature and serious emotional impact of the involuntary termination of parental rights, such action is not authorized unless a preponderance of the evidence clearly warrants it.\u201d\nAs a reviewing court, it is our duty to determine if the findings of the court are supported by competent evidence. In Re Adoption of Baby Girl Fleming, 471 Pa. 73, 369 A.2d 1200 (1977).\nII. Merits\nThe issue before us is whether the trial court correctly concluded that appellant\u2019s parental rights should be terminated under \u00a7 311(2) of the Adoption Act. The evidence presented at the hearing established the following:\nShortly after Baby Girl M. was born, she was placed in the custody of the Agency by Lois M. From August, 1974 until April, 1976, appellant visited his daughter only four times with a full year passing between the second and third visits. During this period, appellant called the Agency only once to ask about the child. Further, appellant had paid nothing toward either the expenses involved in the baby\u2019s birth or the child\u2019s support. Appellant was not employed at the time of the hearings.\nAt the time of learning that Lois M. was pregnant, appellant balked at marriage, claiming that he wished to finish high school. Subsequently, he was permanently expelled from school.\nAt the hearing, appellant was unable to articulate his plans for caring for the child except to state that Baby Girl M. would be raised by his mother. The judge found that appellant\u2019s refusal to allow termination of his parental rights was solely the result of his mother\u2019s interest in the child, rather than his own concern. The judge made the following relevant findings of fact:\n\u201c30. At the present time Joseph is absolutely unable to care for the baby. He has neither the financial resources nor the maturity to provide a home for the baby, short of the continuing interest of his mother.\n\u201c31. There is no reason to question the sincerity of the mother\u2019s interest in having the baby, but Joseph has not demonstrated his own interest and should something untoward happen to the mother, Joseph is not in a position to care for the baby, nor has he indicated that he would do so.\u201d\nIn the case of In Re Geiger, 459 Pa. 636, 639, 331 A.2d 172, 173 (1975), we stated:\n\u201cA reading of section 311(2) indicates that three things must be shown before a natural parent\u2019s rights in a child will be terminated: (1) repeated and continued incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal must be shown; (2) such incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal must be shown to have caused the child to be without essential parental care, control or subsistence; and (3) it must be shown that the causes of the incapacity, abuse, neglect or refusal cannot or will not be remedied.\u201d\nWe believe the three elements are supported and proven in the record, thus allowing the termination of appellant\u2019s parental rights.\nIn Appeal of Diane B., 456 Pa. 429, 435, 321 A.2d 618, 621 (1974), we defined essential parental duties as \u201ccare, control, love, protection, support and subsistence\u201d. Appellant had provided none of the elements listed. Further, appellant\u2019s refusal to do so has clearly left the child without essential parental care. As we stated in Appeal of Diane B., supra, 456 Pa. at 434, 321 A.2d at 620:\n\u201c . . .as this Court stated in Smith Adoption Case, 412 Pa. 501 at 505, 194 A.2d 919 at 992: \u2018Parental rights may not be preserved by complete indifference to the daily needs of a child or by merely waiting for some more suitable financial circumstances or convenient time for the performance of parental duties and responsibilities (while others adequately provide the child with her immediate and continuing physical and emotional needs).\u2019 Affirmative response to the continuing needs of the child is required if the parental right is not to be forfeited.\u201d\nFinally, the court found that these deficiencies would not be corrected. The court found, and after reviewing the record we agree, that appellant lacks both the ability and maturity to understand and care for the needs of his child.\nAppellant argues that the court erred in considering the best interests of the child in determining if the parental rights should be terminated. The court\u2019s decision, however, was based solely on \u00a7 311(2) of the Adoption Act. Appellant\u2019s claim is both meritless and frivolous.\nHaving reviewed the entire record, we believe sufficient proof existed to allow termination of appellant\u2019s parental rights.\nDecree affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nMANDERINO, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nNIX, J., dissents.\n. During this year appellant left Pennsylvania and moved to Florida. During this period, appellant never attempted to make contact with the child.\n. The trial court also held that appellant\u2019s parental rights could be terminated under \u00a7 311(1) of the Adoption Act. Having found sufficient evidence under \u00a7 311(2), we need not discuss the trial court\u2019s alternative holding."}
