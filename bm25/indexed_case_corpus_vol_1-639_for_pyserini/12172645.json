The issues, as stated by Petitioner, are:\n(1) Does the Superior Court\u2019s ruling that Petitioner\u2019s failure to challenge the involuntary commitment Order within thirty days of it\u2019s [sic] entry was fatal to his petition for Expungement conflict with this Honorable Court\u2019s holding in Wolfe v. Beal, 477 Pa. 477, 384 A.2d 1187 (1978) and other holdings of the Superior Court?\n(2) Does the Superior Court\u2019s holding affirming the procedure employed by the lower Court which had conducted the review of the tape recording of Petitioner\u2019s 303 hearing, without a record being made and without Petitioner\u2019s notice of the hearing or his presence at same, contrary to fundamental principles of due process, conflict with decisions of this Court and the Superior Court and depart so far from accepted judicial practices as to call for the exercise of this Honorable Court\u2019s supervisory authority?"}
