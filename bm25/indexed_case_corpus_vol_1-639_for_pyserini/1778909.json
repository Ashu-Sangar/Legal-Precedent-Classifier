{"id": "1778909", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThe Commonwealth appeals from an order of the Superior Court granting appellee, John Ronald Dello Buono, post-conviction relief from judgments of sentence entered in 1975 after appellee pled guilty to charges arising from a series of robberies. The Superior Court granted appellee a trial on the theory that previous counsel provided ineffective assistance in failing to object to a defective guilty-plea colloquy. Because the record establishes that appellee was informed of those constitutional rights essential to an understanding and voluntary waiver of a trial, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and reinstate the judgments of sentence.\nOn March 5,1975, appellee tendered a plea of guilty to the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County. In the presence of the court, appellee\u2019s counsel conducted an on-the-record colloquy with appellee. At that time, appellee\u2019s counsel failed to inform appellee that, if tried by a jury, a jury\u2019s verdict of guilty would have to be unanimous and that appellee would be presumed innocent until found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court adjourned the hearing and continued the matter until a pre-sentence report could be prepared.\nOn May 2, 1975, the hearing resumed and the trial court conducted a second colloquy with appellee. In this colloquy, the court informed appellee of those rights which appellee\u2019s counsel had failed to discuss during the March 5th colloquy and then asked appellee whether he adhered to his March 5th decision to enter a plea of guilty. After this second colloquy, the trial court determined, in light of both colloquies, that appellee\u2019s plea of guilty to all charges was \u201cknowingly, intelligently and voluntarily\u201d entered. Accordingly, the Court accepted the plea and sentenced appellee to a term of ten to twenty-five years\u2019 imprisonment. Appellee did not file a petition to withdraw his guilty plea and did not file a direct appeal.\nIn PCHA proceedings, appellee contended that counsel had been ineffective for failing to object to an allegedly inadequate guilty-plea colloquy. After an evidentiary hearing, the PCHA court denied relief and an appeal was taken to the Superior Court.\nIn granting appellee a new trial, the Superior Court proceeded on the premise that appellee\u2019s plea had been accepted on March 5th. Thus the Superior Court concluded that only the March 5th colloquy, and not the subsequent colloquy of May 2nd, could be considered in determining whether appellee had voluntarily and understanding^ waived his right to trial. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nContrary to the Superior Court\u2019s premise, the record establishes that the trial court did not accept appellee\u2019s plea on March 5th, but instead expressly \u201ccontinued\u201d the matter until a later date. On May 2nd, prior to sentencing, the trial court stated that the determination of the voluntariness of appellee\u2019s plea had been deferred pending a pre-sentence investigation and then proceeded to conduct a colloquy with appellee. During this colloquy, the court several times referred to the March 5th colloquy, asking petitioner if he recalled and understood the rights that had been explained to him by his counsel at that time. In addition, the trial court fully explained the juror-unanimity requirement and the presumption of innocence:\n\u201cQ. You do understand, I am sure from speaking to Mr. Narducci [(defense counsel)], that the determination of the jury as to your guilt or innocence with regard to each of these separate offenses would have to be by unanimous verdict? In other words they would all collectively have to agree as to your guilt . . . with regard to each of these events, each of the offenses which have been set forth and for which you would be tried. Are you aware of that, sir?\nA. Yes, I am.\nQ. Do you further understand of course that as the defendant you are cloaked with the presumption of innocence and you have no burden in a trial of a case, that the Commonwealth has the burden of proof which never shifts from it, the burden of proving your guilt . .. beyond a reasonable doubt with regard to each of these matters?\nA. Yes, I am.\u201d\nNot until the end of the May 2nd colloquy did the court accept the plea, stating:\n\u201cThe Court determines that the defendant knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily has entered his plea to these matters which have been reviewed not only today but also I guess several months ago. I am not sure of the date.\u201d\nIn light of the May 2nd colloquy, conducted prior to the court\u2019s acceptance of appellee\u2019s guilty plea, it must be concluded that appellee was fully informed of his rights. Thus, appellee has not established that counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the guilty-plea colloquy. See Commonwealth v. Rice, 456 Pa. 90, 318 A.2d 705 (1974) (counsel not ineffective for failing to pursue baseless claim). Cf. Commonwealth v. Smith, 498 Pa. 661,450 A.2d 973 (1982) (signed waiver form in which defendant acknowledged understanding of juror-unanimity and defendant-participation requirements foreclosed claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to colloquy).\nOrder of the Superior Court reversed and judgments of sentence reinstated.\nPa.R.Crim.Proc. 319(a) directs that a guilty plea is not to be accepted unless a court \u201cdetermines after inquiry of the defendant that the plea is voluntarily and understanding^ tendered. Such inquiry shall appear on the record.\u201d The commentary to Rule 319 provides; in pertinent part:\n\u201c[A]t a minimum the judge should ask questions to elicit the following information:\n(1) Does the defendant understand the nature of the charge to which he is pleading guilty?\n(2) Is there a factual basis for the plea?\n(3) Does the defendant understand that he has the right to a trial by jury?\n(4) Does the defendant understand that he is presumed innocent until he is found guilty?\n(5) Is the defendant aware of the permissible range of sentences and/or fines for the offenses charged?\n(6) Is the defendant aware that the judge is not bound by the terms of any plea agreement tendered unless the judge accepts such agreement?\u201d"}
