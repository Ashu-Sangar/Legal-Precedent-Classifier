{"id": "1898610", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Eagen,\n.The plaintiff in an action of trespass appeals from the decision of the court below, sustaining preliminary objections to the complaint in the nature of a demurrer.\nThe single question for decision may be stated thusly: Is there a right of recovery under the Pennsylvania Wrongful Death Act and Survival Statute by the administrator of an estate on behalf of a viable fetus that is stillborn?\nThe facts pleaded in the complaint are briefly these: Shirley Marko, six months\u2019 pregnant with a \u201cviable child\u201d, was a passenger in a trackless trolley owned and operated by the defendant-corporation; that as a result of negligence on the part of the defendant, electricity passed through the body of Shirley Marko, which resulted in the death of the infant, Joan Marko, plaintiff\u2019s decedent, while en ventre sa mere, and caused her to be delivered stillborn.\nThe issue is controlled by our recent decision in Carroll v. Skloff, 415 Pa. 47, 202 A. 2d 9 (1964). The plaintiff argues that Carroll is distinguishable in that therein the infant involved was of only ten weeks\u2019 gestation, and hence, obviously, was not viable. The contention is without merit.\nCarroll came before us on the pleadings only. The complaint alleged that the infant was a \u201cviable fetus\u201d. The issue for decision was whether or not the complaint set forth a cause of action. We necessarily accepted the facts as pleaded, and considered the case as one involving a \u201cviable fetus\u201d. Moreover, it was our conelusion that, under the circumstances, the fact of viability was incidental and not controlling.\nJanuary 17, 1966:\nThe plaintiff also maintains that our decision in Carroll is not in accord with Sinkler v. Kneale, 401 Pa. 267, 164 A. 2d 93 (1960). To this, we cannot subscribe. The situations presented are vastly dissimilar. In Hinkler, we ruled that a child born alive could recover for prenatal injury (whether viable or not at the time of the injury) suffered through the wrongful act of another. In such a case, as contrasted with the one now before us, the problems of proof of causation and pecuniary loss are reduced, and a just result is reasonably attainable. Additionally, the real basis for the decision in Hinkler and kindred cases is to permit the child to recover just compensation from the wrongdoer for injuries and for the loss the child itself has and will suffer. In the present case, the real objective is to compensate the survivors, particularly the parents, for their emotional distress. Neither the wrongful death act nor the survival statute contemplates, or ever intended to include, such a claim. Also, the mother may seek redress and the compensation due for the mental anguish suffered, in her own independent action.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Roberts concurs in the result.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents.\nAct of April 26, 1855, P. L. 309, \u00a71, as amended, 12 P.S. \u00a71602.\nAct Of April 18, 1949, P. L. 512, \u00a7601, 20 P.S. \u00a7320.601."}
