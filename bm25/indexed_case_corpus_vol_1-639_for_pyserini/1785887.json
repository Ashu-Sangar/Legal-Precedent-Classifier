{"id": "1785887", "contents": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nFollowing the death of John McConnell in 1979, appellants William and Richard McConnell, co-executors of the Estate of John McConnell, filed with the Department of Revenue Board of Appeals a class action petition for a refund, pursuant to the Senior Citizens Rebate and Assistance Act, Act of March 11, 1971, P.L. 104, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4751-1 et seq. The Board of Appeals determined that it had no jurisdiction to resolve appellants\u2019 class action request, and denied appellants\u2019 request for a rebate. On appeal, the Board of Finance and Revenue sustained the action of the Board of Appeals.\nAppellants then appealed to the Commonwealth Court by way of a Class Petition for Review which sought two types of relief: certification of this matter as a class action; and appellate review of the action of the Board of Finance and Revenue, including review of that board\u2019s failure to certify this matter as a class action. Appellants then filed a motion to have the Commonwealth Court certify their suit as a class action. The Commonwealth Court denied the motion, stating\nIt is true that the Rules of Civil Procedure are applicable to pleadings in this Court which have been instituted in our original jurisdiction, Pa.R.A.P. 1517, but Petitioners are here in the appellate process. It is only where a class has been determined by the trial court or an agency authorized to determine a class that the case may proceed as a class action on appeal. This is for the obvious reason that appellate courts have no mechanism by which a class can be determined with the exception of this Court when it is exercising its original jurisdiction.\nMemorandum Opinion at 2-3 (emphasis in original). This direct appeal followed.\nThe sole question raised by appellants is whether the Commonwealth Court, in an action seeking review of a decision of the Board of Finance and Revenue, may entertain a request to certify an action as a class action. We have concluded that the Commonwealth Court should have considered appellants\u2019 motion on the merits and therefore reverse.\nReview of determinations of the Board of Finance and Revenue is governed by Pa.R.A.P. 1571. Although the Commonwealth Court hears such cases in its appellate jurisdiction, the Commonwealth Court functions essentially as a trial court under Rule 1571. Thus, the Commonwealth Court, in its appellate jurisdiction, must consider a record made by the parties specifically for that court rather than one certified to the court from the proceedings below, Pa.R.A.P. 1571(f); and must resolve issues of fact on which the parties disagree, Pa.R.A.P. 1571(f); and a party must file exceptions to an initial determination of the Commonwealth Court in order to preserve issues for appeal, Pa.R.A.P. 1571(i).\nIn view of the fact that Pa.R.A.P. 1571 empowers the Commonwealth Court to conduct factfinding proceedings, it is clear that that court already possesses the machinery necessary to resolve a motion for class certification. In addition, we have concluded that the Rules of Appellate Procedure specifically authorize the Commonwealth Court to entertain such a motion.\nOur rules recognize the fact that appellate courts entertaining petitions for review must frequently act as trial courts. Thus, Pa.R.A.P. 1517 provides:\nUnless otherwise prescribed by these rules, the practice and procedure under this chapter relating to pleadings shall be in accordance with the appropriate Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, so far as they may be applied.\nSince there is no provision in Pa.R.A.P. 1571 excluding the certification of class actions from proceedings to review determinations of the Board of Finance and Revenue, we hold that the Rules of Civil Procedure relating to class actions, Pa.R.C.P. 1701-1716, apply to such proceedings.\nIn fact, if appellants are to have any opportunity to obtain class certification in this case, that opportunity will have to come before the Commonwealth Court, since neither the statute nor the rules governing actions for rent rebates before the Department of Revenue and the Board of Finance and Revenue authorizes the maintenance of a class action.\nThis Court has recognized the benefits of class actions. \u201c \u2018By establishing a technique whereby the claims of many individuals can be resolved at the same time, the class suit both eliminates the possibility of repetitious litigation and provides small claimants with a method of obtaining redress for claims which would otherwise be too small to warrant individual litigation.\u2019 Thus effective use of the class action device could serve the interests both of judicial administration and of justice.\u201d\nBell v. Beneficial Consumer Discount Company, 465 Pa. 225, 348 A.2d 734, 737 (1975), citing Wright, Class Actions, 47 F.R.D. 169, 170 (1970), quoting Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 391 F.2d 555, 560 (2d Cir.1968).\nAccordingly, in order to promote the interests of judicial administration and justice by eliminating the possibility of repetitious litigation and providing claimants with a method of obtaining redress for claims which would otherwise be too small to warrant individual litigation, we hold that the Commonwealth Court, in addition to trying the merits of appellants\u2019 case, must also entertain appellants\u2019 request for class certification.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nROBERTS, C.J., filed a dissenting opinion in which HUTCHINSON and ZAPPALA, JJ., join.\n. Jurisdiction for this appeal was invoked pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 763, allowing direct appeals to the Commonwealth Court from governmental agencies.\n. Jurisdiction for this direct appeal from the Commonwealth Court is conferred by 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 723(b). A denial of class action status is a final appealable order. See Bell v. Beneficial Consumer Discount Company, 465 Pa. 225, 348 A.2d 734 (1975).\n. Since this appeal was filed immediately after the Commonwealth Court denied appellants\u2019 motion to certify this matter as a class action, the Commonwealth Court has not yet considered the remaining issues contained in appellants\u2019 petition for review, namely, whether the Board of Finance and Revenue erred 1) in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider certification of this matter as a class action, and 2) in denying appellants relief under the Senior Citizens Rebate and Assistance Act.\n. Pa.R.A.P. 1571, entitled Review of Determinations of the Board of Finance and Revenue, provides:\n(a) General rule. Review of a determination of the Board of Finance and Revenue shall be governed by this chapter [Chapter 15 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure] and ancillary provisions of these rules, except as otherwise prescribed by this rule.\n. See 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 763.\n. Pa.R.A.P. 1571(f) provides:\nRecord. No record shall be certified to the court by the Board of Finance and Revenue. After the filing of the petition for review the parties shall take appropriate steps to prepare and file a stipulation of such facts as may be agreed to and to identify the issues of fact, if any, which remain to be tried. See Rule 1542(b) (evidentiary hearing).\n. Pa.R.A.P. 1571(i) provides:\nExceptions. Any party may file exceptions to an initial determination by the trial court under this rule within 30 days after the entry of the order to which exception is taken.... Issues not raised on exceptions are waived and cannot be raised on appeal.\n. In fact, both the statute and the rules specifically provide for the maintenance of rent rebate actions only by individual claimants. See 72 P.S. \u00a7 4751-3(7) (\" \u2018Claimant\u2019 means a person who files a claim for property tax rebate or rent rebate ....\u201d); 61 Pa.Code \u00a7 401.1 (\u201cA claimant means an individual who has filed a claim for a rebate under the Senior Citizens Property Tax or Rent Rebate Act....\u201d); 61 Pa.Code \u00a7 403.3 (\"Each claimant applying for a rebate under the Senior Citizens Property Tax or Rent Rebate Act shall file a claim ... with the Department of Revenue ....\u2019\u2019); 72 P.S. \u00a7 4751-11.2 and 61 Pa.Code \u00a7 405.2 (\"[T]he claimant who is adversely affected by such decision [of the Department] may by petition request the Board of Finance and Revenue to review such action.\u201d); 61 Pa.Code \u00a7 701.3(a) (\"Separate notarized petitions shall be filed with the Board ... for each claim for which refund or review is requested.\u201d).\n. On the merits, appellants challenge the validity of Department of Revenue Regulation 104.4(a), 61 Pa.Code \u00a7 401.43(a), which provides:\nA claim for a property tax rebate or rent rebate in lieu of property taxes may be filed by the personal representative of a decedent\u2019s estate if, and only if, the decedent were alive on or after January 1 of the year next succeeding the calendar year for which a rebate is claimed.\n. Of course, at this stage of the proceedings we express no opinion on the merits of appellants\u2019 request to maintain this action as a class action."}
