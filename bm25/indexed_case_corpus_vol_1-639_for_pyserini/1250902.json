{"id": "1250902", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Horace Stern,\nPlaintiff, Walter P. Baldesberger, claims that by virtue of the will of his deceased father he is the owner in fee simple of a certain portion of a farm property which his father had owned, but plaintiff\u2019s sister, Carrie Baldesberger, one of the defendants, claims that that will gave her a life estate in the property.\nThe father, Michael Baldesberger, died in 1915 leaving to survive him his widow and eleven children. By his will, written in 1909, he bequeathed and devised to his wife, for her life, all of his personal property and the use of all of his real estate. He owned a farm situate in Upper St. Clair Township, Allegheny County, containing 53 acres, 37 of which lay on the northwest side of a public highway and contained no buildings or improvements and the remaining 16 acres lay on the southeast side of the highway and contained the farmhouse, barn, and other outbuildings. He devised the 37 acre portion of the property, after the death of his wife, to all his children to be equally divided between them. There is no present controversy in regard to that devise.\nMichael Baldesberger\u2019s will then proceeded as follows: \u201cFIFTH: At the death of my wife, I direct the residue of my farm, with the buildings thereon, together with all farm implements, stock, and furniture, lying southeast of said public road and containing sixteen acres, more or less, to be kept as a home for such of my children as may remain single, and upon the death of said children remaining unmarried, or upon the marriage of all of my said children for whom said house is kept, I devise and bequeath said portion of my farm to my youngest son, Walter Baldesberger, in fee simple, and in case of his death before the death or marriage of such of my children remaining single and for whom said home is provided, I devise said portion of my farm to the youngest of my. children living at the death or marriage of the surviving child for whom said home is provided in this my will.\u201d\nFollowing his father\u2019s death the plaintiff, upon returning from Army service and at the request of his mother and brothers and sisters, operated the farm until the mother died in 1936. At that time, of the eleven children one had died and all the others had married except plaintiff and his sister Carrie; Walter married in 1939. Carrie, who is a school teacher, had left the family home on the farm in 1925 and had then purchased a lot in Carrick (now a part of the City of Pittsburgh) and built thereon a house for herself in which she has lived continuously to the present time. She registered there for the purpose of voting, voted in the elections held in that municipality and never in the township where the farm was located, and never went back to the farm except for occasional visits over week-ends and during vacation periods. Walter has continued to live upon and operate the farm.\nThe present declaratory judgment proceeding was instituted in 1944 to determine the respective rights of the plaintiff and his sisters and brother named as defendants. We note that the pleadings of both parties were all filed by the beginning of the following year, but for some unexplained reason nothing further was done for a period of eight years when a praecipe was filed for a jury trial. The question submitted to the jury was whether Carrie Baldesberger had abandoned or forfeited her interest in the fifth paragraph of her father\u2019s will. The verdict of the jury was that she had abandoned her rights therein. The court, however, thereupon held that by that paragraph she was devised a life estate which she could not lose by abandonment, and therefore the court entered judgment for defendants. Exceptions to this action of the court having been dismissed by the court en banc, plaintiff appeals.\nDefendant\u2019s contention is that her father\u2019s will gave her an unconditional life estate, and, if that were so, plaintiff admits that such an estate could not be lost or forfeited by abandonment. It is plaintiff\u2019s position, however, that defendant obtained under the will merely an incorporeal right or privilege to use the property for her home, and, if that were so, defendant admits that such a right could be abandoned. The controlling question in the case, therefore, is the nature and extent of the interest which defendant acquired by the fifth paragraph of her father\u2019s will.\nIt is our opinion that that interest was not a life estate but merely an incorporeal right or privilege. The testator\u2019s will is couched in technical legal language. It devised his real estate to his wife for life and devised the portion of the farm in question, after the death of his wife, to plaintiff in fee simple. As far as the other children were concerned, there is no such language employed, but merely a direction that that portion of his farm and the buildings thereon, with the farm implements, stock and furniture, was \u201cto be kept as a home\u201d for those children who might remain single and he speaks later of the children \u201cfor whom said home is provided.\u201d This is not the case, therefore, of a devise of an estate in property followed by an explanation of the testator\u2019s purpose in making the devise; obviously such an explanation would not have the effect of limiting the devise itself.' Here, on the contrary, -there is merely a provision that the property \u201cbe kept as a home,\u201d \u2014 the grant of a privilege to occupy the property as a home, nothing more. It was clearly the testator\u2019s intention that plaintiff should succeed to the complete ownership of this portion of the farm in subordination only to one other intention, namely, that the property was to be available to any or all of testator\u2019s unmarried children so long, but only so long, as they might desire to make it their home. Certainly he did not intend that the farmhouse might remain vacant, possibly for the life span of a child of 50, 60 or 70 years during which time none of the children, even though unmarried, resided or wished to reside there. It is also to be borne in mind, and the testator must be presumed to have known, that a life estate may be conveyed to a stranger, and that it is subject to encumbrance and sale on execution to a stranger; indeed the defendant apparently recognizes that if she does have a life estate she can lease the property to some other person, because she has in fact brought a suit to recover rent from the plaintiff who occupies the farm. Defendant actually contends that she is not obliged to use the property for a home at any time whatever during her life and that the will did not provide that an unmarried child would forfeit his or her interest if he or she permanently abandoned the property or chose never to live there in the first place, but it is inconceivable that the testator intended to give her, or any of his children who remained single, a freehold estate which could defeat (and, if defendant\u2019s position is sustained, would in the present case defeat) his express purpose in providing that the property should be kept as a home, that being clearly his only reason for deferring plaintiff\u2019s accession to the ownership.\nIt would scarcely be helpful to analyze in detail cases in the books which involved a question similar to that here presented since the decisions in all of them naturally depended on. their own peculiar facts. Briefly, however, it may be noted that in Chappel v. Row, 9 Pa. 72, where there was a grant in fee but a reservation to the grantor\u2019s father and mother during their lives of the possession of the land \u201cas a home or residence for them,\u201d it was held that the father and mother had no estate which they could assign to a stranger but only a right to occupy the land as a home. The court said that \u201cIt was clearly the intention of the parties to the deed, to provide a comfortable home for their aged parents during their joint lives, provided they made the property a permanent home or residence.\u201d In Calhoun v. Jester, 11 Pa. 474, where there was a devise of a plantation but with a provision that the testator\u2019s son, John, should have the privilege of living on the place during his life, it was held that this gave John, not an estate, but a license. The court said that \u201cHad he taken an estate, it would have been liable to judgment and execution by his creditors \u2014 the very thing, perhaps, which the testator designed to prevent.\u201d In Kearns v. Kearns, 107 Pa. 575, where there was a devise to the testator\u2019s wife of any part of his dwelling house which she might desire to occupy during her life, for her use and the use of their two daughters so long as they remained unmarried, it was held that the daughters had merely a right of occupancy which ceased with their mother\u2019s death. The court said that \u201cThe evident intention of the devise was that the daughters who remained single should make it their home with their mother during the continuance of her estate. The estate was not given directly to the daughters. It was given to the mother.\u201d In Shipley\u2019s Estate, 45 Pa. Superior Ct. 570, where there was a direction by the testator that his sister should have the right to retain the use of a house as a family residence as long as she might wish to do so, it was held that the sister took merely a personal license or privilege to occupy the house and not a life estate. The court said that \u201cIt is . . . clear that there was no intention to incumber the right or privilege thus conferred upon her with any of the incidental obligations that would attach to or flow from the creation of a life estate in her favor.\u201d In Sinnott\u2019s Estate, 53 Pa. Superior Ct. 383, a similar provision for the testator\u2019s wife was held to give her merely a personal privilege to occupy the residence and not a life estate therein.\nThe cases relied upon by defendant are all distinguishable. In Wusthoff v. Dracourt, 3 Watts 240, there was a devise of a house with a reservation of two of the rooms for the use of the devisee\u2019s mother during her life; the testator stated that his desire in reserving the rooms for her was that she should be sure of a shelter or home during the time she might have to live. It was held that she received a life estate and not a mere personal privilege. However it is clear that there the mother was expressly given an unconditional life interest in the property and the testator merely made an explanatory statement as to his purpose in making the gift, namely, that she should be sure of a home. In Wilson v. McKeehan, 53 Pa. 79, there was a devise to the testator\u2019s wife and children of all the proceeds of his farm during her life, she to have the privilege of living with the family in the dwelling house as long as she lived. It was properly held that the grant of the proceeds of the farm was a devise of the property itself and therefore conferred a life estate; the privilege of living with the family was merely a superfluous additional grant. In Bell v. Fulton, 1 Sadler 200, there was a devise of the testator\u2019s farm and furniture for the use of his family, \u201cto be joint or common property,\u201d the profits therefrom to be considered as the property of the family jointly or of so many of them as might remain in a family ca-parity; there was an express provision that if any of the testator\u2019s daughters withdrew from the family other provision was to be made for her. It was held that of the \u201cjoint or common property\u201d each child received an undivided interest in the farm for life. Here there was a clear devise of the property to the children, their interests to terminate on their withdrawal from the family. In McCalla\u2019s Estate, 16 Pa. Superior Ct. 202, the testatrix left her property for a home to a wife and husband during their lives. It was held that they were not obliged to occupy the property as a home. Here life estates were clearly given by express grant; the words \u201cfor a home\u201d were merely, as the court said, the expression by testatrix of the purpose \u201cfor which she recommended and desired the property to be used, or explanatory of her bounty.\u201d In Cheroka v. Tobolski, 151 Pa. Superior Ct. 238, 30 A. 2d 152, there was a conveyance of property subject to a reservation by the grantor of \u201ca certain estate . . . for and during the term of her natural life.\u201d This was so clearly and expressly the reservation of a life estate that, as the court said, no other interpretation of the language was possible.\nWe are, then, clearly of opinion that in the present case the interest given to the unmarried children in the testator\u2019s will was merely that of a privilege to occupy the property as a home and not the devise of a life estate; therefore it was a right or privilege which could be abandoned, and the jury\u2019s verdict established that it was in fact abandoned by the defendant. And since, as thus decided, her interest in the property ceased upon her abandonment of it as a home, such abandonment had the same effect under the testator\u2019s will as if she had married or died, and, since all the other surviving children are married, it follows, from well settled applicable rules, that the devise of the remainder to the plaintiff was accelerated, that he is the present owner in fee simple of the property in question, and that there is no other valid outstanding title: Fletcher v. Hoblitzell, 209 Pa. 337, 344, 58 A. 672, 674; Wyllmer\u2019s Estate, 65 Pa. Superior Ct. 396.\nThe judgment of the court below is reversed. It is declared that none of the defendants has any right, title or interest in the premises in controversy. It is further declared that plaintiff is the present owner in fee simple of the premises, and judgment is here entered in his favor.\nThe defendants other than Carrie claimed that one of them might eventually become the owner of the property if Walter did not survive Carrie\u2019s death or. marriage. Carrie will hereinafter be referred to as the defendant"}
