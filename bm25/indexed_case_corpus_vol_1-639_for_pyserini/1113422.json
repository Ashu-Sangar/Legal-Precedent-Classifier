{"id": "1113422", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn answer to plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, defendant filed an affidavit of defense in lieu of demurrer. On July-13, 1927, the court below made the following order: \u201cIt is adjudged that plaintiffs have not set out a good cause of action.\u201d Plaintiffs petitioned for reargument, and this was granted November 16, 1927. On January 23d, the court below ruled: \u201cafter reargument we adhere to our opinion that the statement filed does not set out a good cause of action.\u201d Plaintiff appealed to us from this order. Appellee has moved to quash, on the grounds that the only appealable order-was the original one of July 13, 1927, and the present appeal was not taken within three months from that time, as required by statute ; that an order for reargument does not stay the running of the statutory period: Barlott v. Forney, 187 Pa. 301, 303; Henry\u2019s Est., 290 Pa. 537.\nAppellee\u2019s motion must be sustained, but not on the grounds stated by him. It is obvious that neither order entered by the court below is a final one; to make either of these orders final, it would have to be followed by some such words as \u201cand judgment is now entered for defendant\u201d: Smith v. Phila. & Reading Ry., 286 Pa. 55, 56. An appeal cannot be taken until after a final judgment has been entered in the case (American Trust Co. v. Kaufman, 279 Pa. 230, 233); upon the entry of such a judgment, plaintiff\u2019s right to appeal will arise.\nThe present appeal is quashed."}
