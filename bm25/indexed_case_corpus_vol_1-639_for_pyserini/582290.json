{"id": "582290", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nFor six months prior to his death, Samuel C. Heiney was aware that he had terminal cancer. During this period his physical condition deteriorated rapidly. Seventeen days prior to his death, Heiney executed a will devising Ms farm to Ms son L. Russell Heiney and directing the residue of his estate to be converted into cast and divided equally among Ms eigM cMldren.\nSix of decedent\u2019s eight cMldren challenged the will. The only evidence presented to the register of wills by contestants was the testimony of a handwriting expert. The proponents of the will called the subscribing and attesting witnesses. The register found the signature genuine and concluded that contestants failed to establish either lack of testamentary capacity or undue influence.\nIn the orphans\u2019 court, the challengers requested that a jury be impanelled to decide the issue of testamentary capacity. The court refused this request and filed an opirnon in support of its decision. After talcing extensive testimony, the court affirmed the register\u2019s decree and issued a second opinion. TMs appeal followed. We affirm.\nAppellants have concentrated their attack upon the alleged lack of testamentary capacity. They contend that the orphans\u2019 court erred in placing upon them the burden of proving the decedent\u2019s lack of capacity. While admitting the general rule is that testamentary capacity is presumed, Brantlinger Will, 418 Pa. 236, 210 A.2d 246 (1965); Williams v. McCarroll, 374 Pa. 281, 97 A. 2d 14 (1953), appellants assert that this ease falls within an exception to the rule.\nIn Girsh Trust, 410 Pa. 455, 189 A.2d 852 (1963), this Court held that when a settlor for two years prior to the execution of an inter vivos trust had been under treatment for \u201cparanoid schizophrenia,\u201d and for four years thereafter was institutionalized, the presumption of competency had been overcome. The burden then shifted to those asserting the validity of the instrument to prove that it was executed during a lucid interval. Id. at 468-70, 189 A.2d at 858-59. See First National Bank v. Wirebach\u2019s Executor, 106 Pa. 37, 46 (1884).\nHere, however, the trial judge was justified in concluding that appellants failed to meet their initial burden of showing mental incapacity. Although appellants produced numerous witnesses who testified that in their opinions decedent\u2019s mental faculties were declining, we cannot, on the instant record, conclude as a matter of law that the orphans\u2019 court erred in refusing to shift to appellees the burden of proving testamentary capacity. Dettra Will, 415 Pa. 197, 201, 202 A.2d 827, 830 (1964). The evidence was in conflict. Credibility was the determining element. The scope of our review is limited to whether findings of fact are supported by sufficient evidence and whether there has been an error of law or abuse of discretion. Shewchuk Estate, 444 Pa. 249, 260, 282 A.2d 307, 313 (1971); Mintz Trust, 444 Pa. 189, 196, 282 A.2d 295, 299 (1971); Gramm Estate, 437 Pa. 381, 386, 263 A.2d 445, 447 (1970); Abrams Will, 419 Pa. 92, 101, 213 A.2d 638, 643 (1965). We conclude that sufficient evidence supports the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s finding that appellants had not established habitual unsoundness of mind or lack of testamentary capacity. The presumption of testamentary capacity thus survived.\nIt is also argued that the orphans\u2019 court erred in not finding that the signature on the 1965 will is a forgery. Appellants presented a handwriting expert and several lay witnesses who testified that in their opinions the signature was not testator\u2019s. The proponents of the will called a subscribing witness and an attesting witness. The orphans\u2019 court, as finder of fact, accepted the testimony offered by the proponents. This was not error. Shewchuk Estate, supra; Mintz Trust, supra.\nForgery presents an issue of fact, resolution of which necessarily turns on the court\u2019s assessment of the witnesses\u2019 credibility. That the contestants produced expert testimony does not preclude the trier of fact from independently evaluating the evidence. Cline Will, 433 Pa. 543, 547-49, 252 A.2d 657, 660-61 (1969); Elias Will, 429 Pa. 314, 321, 239 A.2d 393, 396 (1968); Pochron Will, 367 Pa. 306, 80 A.2d 794 (1951).\nAppellants raise one additional assignment of error. They urge that the orphans\u2019 court erred in failing to submit questions of fact to a jury. The decision whether to impanel a jury is within the discretion of the orphans\u2019 court. As we noted in Holtz Will, 422 Pa. 540, 544, 222 A.2d 885, 888 (1966) (emphasis in original), \"there is now no statutorily-mandated right to a trial by jury in a will contest; the impanelling of a jury lies solely within the discretion of the chancellor. Moreover, since a jury verdict is now advisory only, the refusal of the chancellor to impanel a jury does not constitute an abuse of discretion . . . .\u201d\nThe decree of the Court of Common Pleas, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, of Lancaster County is affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nMr. Justice Eagen took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nDuring testator\u2019s lifetime L. Russell Heiney had farmed his father\u2019s land on a share basis.\nFor reasons of bis own, testator bequeathed the share of one child, Samuel J. Heiney, to a daughter with the \u201cwish that she will use the additional share given to her for the benefit of my son, Samuel J. Heiney.\u201d\nThe 1965 will superseded one executed on September 11, 1959. The earlier document provided for an equal division of all property, real and personal, among the eight children.\nThe allegation of undue influence, although raised before the register, was abandoned in the orphans\u2019 court and is thus not before this Court.\nThis Court has appellate jurisdiction in matters decided in the orphans\u2019 court division.
