{"id": "969913", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe are of one mind that the court below correctly concluded that, upon the death of Henry S. Leech, his share in the income from the trust created by the testator, less the $5,000 appointed to his widow, passed to his only issue, Mary Leech Cotting, and the same having become part of her estate, it was properly awarded to her administrator. Both appeals are dismissed and the decree is affirmed at appellants\u2019 costs."}
