{"id": "999605", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis case is clearly within the rule of York Trust, etc., Co. v. Gallatin, 186 Pa. 150. The majority of the court are of opinion, that on principle that case was erroneously decided, but as it has stood in the books for nine years, and many contracts have been made in reliance on it, the principle of stare decisis should prevail, and the authority of that decision should not now be disturbed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
