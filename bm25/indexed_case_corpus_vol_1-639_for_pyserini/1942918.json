{"id": "1942918", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Roberts,\nWilliam H. Olson died testate on February 17,1971. His widow and executrix, Fern Weaver Olson, filed an inheritance tax return. Neither the inventory nor the filed return listed any interest of decedent in two joint savings accounts in the Northwest Savings and Loan Association. These accounts with the right of survivorship were in the names of decedent and his brother Paul H. Olson.\nThe Commonwealth filed its tax appraisal and included assessments of both joint accounts. Decedent\u2019s executrix appealed from the assessment. A hearing was held before the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of McKean County. The court concluded that \u201cthese joint bank accounts were created by reason of accident and mistake induced by the Savings institutions themselves . . .\u201d and were not subject to tax. The Commonwealth appealed. Our review of the record satisfies us that the decree must be reversed.\nSection 241 of the Inheritance Tax Act imposes a tax on joint tenancy interests as follows: \u201cWhen any property is held in the names of ttoo or more persons, or is deposited in a financial institution in the names of Uoo or more persons, so that, upon the death of one of them, the survivor or survivors have a right to the immediate ownership or possession and enjoyment of the whole property, the accrual of such right, upon the death of one of them, shall be deemed a transfer subject to taw under this Act, of a fractional portion of such property to be determined by dividing the value of the whole property by the number of joint tenants in existence immediately preceding the death of the deceased joint tenant.\u201d Act of June 15, 1961, P. L. 373, art. II, \u00a7241, 72 P.S. \u00a72485-241 (emphasis added).\nSection 241 in clear and specific language imposes a tax upon a joint account with a right of survivorship, upon the death of one of the joint tenants. The enhanced \u201cright to the immediate ownership or possession and enjoyment of the whole property\u201d thus accruing to the survivor is deemed a statutory transfer subject to tax.\nIn Cochrane\u2019s Estate, 342 Pa. 108, 20 A. 2d 305 (1941), where we sustained the constitutionality of the practically identical predecessor of Section 241, we observed: \u201cWhat is actually acquired by the surviving joint tenant upon the death of the co-tenant is the right to the immediate ownership, possession and enjoyment of the whole property and it is the accrual of this right which the statute properly taxes. . . . Even where one contributes the entire sum to a joint bank account, the rights of each of the tenants to the joint fund are the same. . . . Hence what one tenant acquires on the death of the other, where there are two joint tenants, as here, is the right to the immediate possession, ownership and enjoyment of the entire fund and not, as viewed by appellant, the contribution of the deceased joint tenant.\u201d Id. at 111, 20 A. 2d at 307 (emphasis added); accord Commonwealth v. Nolan\u2019s Estate, 345 Pa. 98, 100-01, 26 A. 2d 308, 310 (1942).\nThe Commonwealth having established the existence of these joint accounts with the light of survivorship, its claim to the tax could only be defeated by clear and convincing proof that the accounts were created as a result of fraud, accident or mistake.\nWe are unable to accept the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the accounts were opened as a result of \u201caccident and mistake.\u201d Olson testified that he opened the joint accounts because \u201cthe clerk, cashier I did business with, said it\u2019s a matter of routine and that most accounts are written that way.\u201d However, Olson also testified that he was a diabetic in poor health, subject to onsets of shock requiring long periods of hospitalization. This testimony combined with the allegation in the executrix\u2019 petition appealing the Commonwealth\u2019s assessment suggest that perhaps the real reason for the joint account may have been one of convenience. Olson\u2019s testimony that the cashier instructed him to open the joint accounts conflicts with the executrix\u2019 allegation in the petition and Olson\u2019s supporting testimony at the hearing that poor health created a need for the joint account on grounds of convenience.\nThe allegation in the executrix\u2019 petition and Olson\u2019s testimony is also difficult to reconcile with his claim that he was not aware that the joint account operated as a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship. Olson testified that \u201che was not explained\u201d the meaning of the signature card and had not read the terms of the contract before signing it. Nevertheless, when asked, \u201cIf you read it would you have understood what it meant?\u201d he replied, \u201cI think so.\u201d This Court has repeatedly held that in the absence of proof of fraud, \u201cfailure to read is an unavailing excuse or defense and cannot justify an avoidance, modification or nullification of the contract or any provision thereof.\u201d Orner v. T. W. Phillips Gas & Oil Co., 401 Pa. 195, 199, 163 A. 2d 880, 883 (1960); T. W. Phillips Gas & Oil Co. v. Kline, 368 Pa. 516, 518, 84 A. 2d 301, 302 (1951); see also Montgomery v. Levy, 406 Pa. 547, 550, 177 A. 2d 448, 450 (1962). This record fails to provide clear and convincing proof of \u201caccident and mistake\u201d on the part of Paul H. Olson in opening these accounts.\nIn Commonwealth v. Nolan\u2019s Estate, supra, one Mary Nolan opened an individual savings account and many years later converted the account into a joint savings account making her sister Margaret Nolan a joint tenant. The evidence indicated that Mary Nolan contributed all the funds and added her sister as a joint tenant only because of her illnesses which often prevented Mary Nolan from making withdrawals and deposits. We there sustained the inheritance tax imposed on that joint account upon the death of Margaret and observed: \u201cWhatever may have been the original intention of the parties, the fact remains that the joint tenancy agreement was fully explained to Margaret C. Nolan, at least and that it was signed by both of the sisters, without any suggestion whatever of duress or fraud. And, while it may be that Margaret C. Nolan made no withdrawals from the account for her own purposes, that fact is not inconsistent with her status as a joint tenant under the terms of the written agreement.\u201d Id. at 102, 26 A. 2d at 310 (emphasis added).\nThe only factual difference between this case and Nolan\u2019s Estate is that the record here does not indicate that the terms of the joint savings accounts were explained to the parties. This is of no consequence. Paul II. Olson specifically testified that if he had taken the time to read the contract, he would have understood its terms. Furthermore, failure to read the provisions of the joint savings accounts furnishes no basis for relieving the accounts of tax liability. Like Nolan\u2019s Estate, supra, there is no evidence of \u201cduress or fraud\u201d. In both cases, the parties expressly created a joint tenancy with the right of survivorship. Upon the death of one party, the survivor enjoyed the accrual of the \u201cright to the immediate ownership or possession and enjoyment of the whole property\u201d subjecting the accounts to the tax.\nThe decree is reversed and the record is remanded for the entry of an appropriate decree consistent with this opinion. Each party to pay own costs.\nAct of June 15, 1961, P. L. 373, art. I, \u00a7101 et seq., 72 P.S. \u00a72485-101 et seq.\nSignature cards were signed by both decedent and Paul H. Olson upon the creation of the joint savings accounts. The cards contained the following provisions:\n\u201cOlson, Paul H.\nand William H.\nas joint tenants with right of survivorship and not as tenants in common, and not as tenants by the entirety, the undersigned hereby apply for a savings account in\nNorthwest Savings and Loan Association\nand for the issuance of evidence thereof in their joint names described as aforesaid. ... It is agreed by the signatory parties with each other and by the parties with you that any funds placed in or added to the account by any one of the parties are and shall be conclusively intended to be a gift and delivery at that time of such funds to the other signatory party or parties to the extent of his or their pro rata interest in the account.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nOne account contained $520.80 while the other contained $8,114.54 at decedent\u2019s death.\nThe Commonwealth originally assessed the full value of both accounts presumably on the theory that the accounts were created less than two years before decedent\u2019s death and were fully taxable as gifts in contemplation of death. Act of .Tune 15, 1961, P. L. 373, art. II, \u00a7222, 72 P.S. \u00a72485-222. The Commonwealth reduced the assessment on one of the accounts to half-value after discovering that it was created more than two years before decedent\u2019s death, and subject only to the tax on joint tenancies. Id. \u00a7241, 72 P.S. \u00a72485-241. The Commonwealth now concedes on appeal that since the survivor Paul H. Olson was the only contributor to the accounts, there is no basis for taxing the account created within two years of decedent\u2019s death at full value as a gift in contemplation of death.\nThe trial court also concluded that the \u201cevidence presented was sufficiently clear, precise and convincing to overcome the prima facie inter vivos gifts alleged by the Commonwealth.\u201d In so concluding, the trial court incorrectly assumed that liability for the inheritance tax was to be resolved by the legal principles governing ownership of joint tenancy interests.\nSome courts have been applying ownership principles to determine the applicability of Section 241 of the Inheritance Tax Act. See, e.g., Nichelson Estate, 16 Fiduc. Rep. 345, 346-47 (O.C. Westmoreland County 1966) ; Kivlin Estate, 13 Fiduc. Rep. 408, 413 (O.C. Lackawanna County 1963) ; Vought Estate, 44 Erie County L.J. 86, 87-88 (O.C. Erie County 1961). The express statutory language makes tlie ownership principles inapplicable to the question of tax liability under Section 241. Commonwealth v. Nolan\u2019s Estate, 345 Pa. 98, 26 A. 2d 308 (1941) ; Cochrane\u2019s Estate, 342 Pa. 108, 20 A. 2d 305 (1941).\nAct of July 31, 1970, P. L. 673, art. II, \u00a7202(3), 17 P.S. \u00a7211.202(3). Appellee neither entered an appearance nor filed a brief on this appeal.\nAct of June 15, 1961, P. L. 373, art. II, \u00a7241, 72 P.S. \u00a72485-241.\nThe petition of the executrix alleged in reference to both accounts: \u201cThat said signature card was executed by William H. Olson as a convenience for Paul H. Olson so that the funds from said account could be used for the benefit of Paul H. Olson in the event of his disability and that as between Paul H. Olson and William H. Olson, the funds in said account were considered the sole property of Paul H. Olson.\u201d\nThe tax provision in question in Nolan\u2019s Estate was the practically identical predecessor of Section 241. See Act of 1.929, P. L. 1795, \u00a71, as amended, Act of 1936, First Ex. Sess., P. L. 44, \u00a72, 72 P.S. \u00a72301 (e).\nAct of June 15, 1961, P. L. 373, Art. II, \u00a7241, 72 P.S. \u00a72485-241 (emphasis added)."}
