{"id": "1727741", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPOMEROY, Justice.\nWe deal in this appeal with whether a party who has moved for judgment non obstante veredicto waives its right to appellate review of a denial of that motion when the party fails to request the trial court to charge in accordance with the legal standard which the moving party later seeks to have applied in judging the sufficiency of the evidence.\nIn 1971, appellee, Richard Broxie, sued appellant, Household Finance Company [\u201cHousehold\u201d], in trespass for damages arising from Broxie\u2019s dismissal as an employee of the United States Post Office. The dismissal had been caused, allegedly, by appellant advising the Post Office by means of letters and telephone calls that Broxie had made numerous defaults in the repayment of a loan to Household. It was not alleged in the complaint, nor was there any proof at trial, that Household actually intended to cause Broxie\u2019s dismissal. At the close of the evidence Household made a timely request for binding instructions, which was denied. The jury was instructed, instead, that although there was no evidence of actual intent on Household\u2019s part to bring about Broxie\u2019s dismissal, the jury could find for Broxie on his claim for intentional interference with contractual relations if Household knew or should have known that Broxie\u2019s discharge was certain or substantially certain to result from Household\u2019s actions. Household neither objected to the court\u2019s charge on the issue of specific intent nor offered a point for charge on that issue. The jury returned a verdict for Broxie. Appellant\u2019s motions for judgment non obstante veredicto and for a new trial were denied by a court en banc.\nHousehold\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court ultimately resulted in an affirmance of the judgment of the trial court. Broxie v. Household Finance Company, 232 Pa. Super. 431, 335 A.2d 823 (1975). In that appeal, the Superior Court did not reach the merits of the issue raised by Household as to the definition of specific intent in the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations. Rather, the court ruled that Household\u2019s failure to object to the trial court\u2019s charge on the element of intent constituted a waiver of the issue. This Court then granted Household\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal. We affirm.\nThe first issue for decision is whether the Superior Court erred in holding that appellant\u2019s failure to take exception to the trial court\u2019s charge on the element of intent in the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations constituted a waiver of its right to appellate review of the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for judgment n. o. v., as well as its motion for a new trial.\nIt has long been the law in this Commonwealth that in order to preserve for appellate review an issue concerning the correctness of a trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, the complaining party must submit a specific point for charge or make a timely specific objection to the charge as given. E. g., Lobalzo v. Varoli, 422 Pa. 5, 220 A.2d 634 (1966); Bell v. Yellow Cab Co., 399 Pa. 332, 160 A.2d 437 (1960). See also Commonwealth v. Sisak, 436 Pa. 262, 259 A.2d 428 (1969). The only exception to this general rule was where a trial court\u2019s charge involved basic and fundamental error, but this exception was formally abrogated in Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114 (1974). See also Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974). Thus there can be no doubt, and appellant apparently concedes, that its failure to object to the trial court\u2019s charge concerning specific intent precludes it from assigning, on appeal, error in that charge as a reason for the grant of a new trial.\nWith respect to the trial court\u2019s refusal of appellant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v., however, it is contended that because appellant fully complied with the procedural requirements relating to such a motion, it automatically preserved for appeal all legal issues bearing on the disposition of its motion for that relief, and that whether the trial court employed the correct legal standard in deciding that the evidence was sufficient to support the verdict is among such preserved issues. The Superior Court disagreed, and we believe it was correct in so doing.\nAs noted above, a party\u2019s failure to object to a trial court\u2019s charge in a specific and timely fashion precludes that party from assigning, on appeal, error in that charge in support of its request for a new trial. We perceive no reason for according disparate treatment to a party who does not object at trial to an allegedly erroneous charge simply because that party is seeking a judgment n. o. v. rather than a new trial. We recognize that conceptually appellant is not directly claiming that the trial court\u2019s charge on specific intent was erroneous, but rather is arguing that the evidence at trial was insufficient as a matter of law to support the verdict rendered. Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the fact that in actuality appellant is seeking to have an appellate court employ a legal standard for judging the sufficiency of the evidence which is different from that used by the trial court and which appellant did not bring to the attention of the trial court in a timely fashion by means of a specific point for charge of a specific objection to the charge as given. In short, the purport of the present argument is that the jury was allowed to reach its verdict under a statement of applicable law which, appellant now contends, was not correct law. But to allow a party to escape the consequences of failing to object timely and specifically to a trial court\u2019s charge simply because of the nature of the relief sought would elevate form over substance. Indeed, given the fact that the remedy of a judgment n. o. v. is more drastic than the award of a new trial, it would be inequitable to address the merits of an unpreserved claim such as appellant\u2019s while refusing a similar request by a party who seeks merely a new trial. We therefore conclude that a party who neither specifically objects to a charge on a particular subject nor offers a specific point for charge waives its right to a judgment n. o. v. (or to appellate review of a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment n. o. v.) where the basis of the motion is that the law against which the sufficiency of the evidence is to be measured was not the law as given to the jury.\nIn this case, appellant is arguing that in measuring the sufficiency of the evidence to make out the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations, the trial court employed an incorrect legal standard as to the element of specific intent. Because appellant neither requested a specific instruction on the element of intent to bring about Broxie\u2019s dismissal from his job, nor took a specific exception to the charge as given on this point, we hold that appellant has waived its right to appellate review of the trial court\u2019s denial of its motion for judgment n. o. v.\nHousehold makes the further claim that, even assuming the trial court\u2019s charge on the element of specific intent was correct, appellant is still entitled to a judgment n. o. v. since there was no competent, credible evidence legally sufficient to sustain the verdict; that is, there was no evidence that Household knew or should have known that Broxie\u2019s dismissal was certain or substantially certain to flow from its actions in contacting Broxie\u2019s employer. Since Household has complied with all the procedural prerequisites for a judgment n. o. v., we agree that it is entitled to appellate review of this issue.\nIt is well-settled that \u201c[i]n considering a motion for judgment n. o. v., the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, and he must be given the benefit of every reasonable inference of fact arising therefrom, and any conflict in the evidence must be resolved in his favor.\u201d Metis v. Griglak, 438 Pa. 392, 395, 264 A.2d 684, 686 (1970) (citations omitted). Moreover, \u201ca judgment n. o. v. will be entered only in a clear case, and . . . any doubts will be resolved in favor of the verdict.\u201d Stewart v. Chernicky, 439 Pa. 43, 53, 266 A.2d 259, 265 (1970) (citations omitted). Viewing the evidence presented at trial in light of this standard of review, we are satisfied that there was sufficient evidence upon which the jury could conclude that Household knew or should have known that its conduct was certain or substantially certain to result in Broxie\u2019s discharge from his job with the Post Office.\nOrder of the Superior Court affirmed.\nJONES, former C. J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. The requested instruction was as follows:\n\u201cSeven. Under all the evidence and the law, your verdict shall be for defendant.\u201d\n. The trial judge thrice specifically asked both counsel if either had anything to add to the instructions, or if anything had been omitted or misstated. No correction or addition to the charge was requested on Household\u2019s behalf with regard to the instruction on specific intent. Moreover, in appellant\u2019s written motions for judgment n. o. v. and new trial no complaint was made as to the charge on specific intent. Not until the argument on post-trial motions did appellant assert that the trial court\u2019s instruction on specific intent had been erroneous. This argument was advanced by new counsel for Household.\n. The affirmance of the trial court\u2019s order occurred the second time the case was before the Superior Court. Household had earlier appealed to that court, following the denial of post-trial motions by the court en banc, and had been granted a new trial on the ground that the court en banc had not followed the proper procedure in attempting to correct an error in the record. Broxie v. Household Finance Company, 228 Pa.Super. 284, 323 A.2d 364 (1974). This Court then granted Broxie\u2019s petition for leave to appeal and simultaneously entered a per curiam opinion reversing the Superior Court\u2019s order on the ground that the error on which it was based had not been properly preserved for appeal. Broxie v. Household Finance Company, 459 Pa. 494, 329 A.2d 835 (1974). The case was remanded to the Superior Court for consideration of the remaining issues raised in the original appeal. Id.\n. See Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, Art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp.1976-1977).\n. In order to perfect the right to request a judgment n. o. v., a party must (1) present a written point requesting binding instructions, and (2) move to have all the evidence presented at trial certified and made part of the record, and for judgment n. o. v. upon the whole record. Act of April 22, 1905, P.L. 286, as amended, 12 P.S. \u00a7 681. Household complied with both of these requirements.\n. Appellant also argues that the Superior Court erred in holding the doctrine of basic and fundamental error inapplicable to an appeal from a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment n. o. v. Specifically, appellant contends that the rationale set forth in Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114 (1974), a case involving the denial of a motion for a new trial, should not be applied where a party is seeking a judgment n. o. v. This is so, it is argued, (1) because in the case of an appeal from the denial of a motion for judgment n. o. v. an appellate court can correct a trial court\u2019s error without requiring further judicial proceedings; and (2) because by limiting the doctrine to cases capable of being finally decided on appeal, the concern expressed in Dilliplaine over the difficulty of applying the doctrine in a principled fashion would be obviated. Recognizing that there is some merit to appellant\u2019s first point, we nevertheless do not believe that application of the doctrine of basic and fundamental error would be any easier in appeals from denials of judgments n. o. v. than in appeals from denials of new trials; we must therefore reject the suggestion that we reinstitute the doctrine on even a limited basis.\n. There is no need for us on this appeal to express any opinion as to the correctness of the court\u2019s charge to the jury or of that part of its opinion in support of denial of post-trial motions which dealt with the element of specific intent, and we do not do so.\n.
