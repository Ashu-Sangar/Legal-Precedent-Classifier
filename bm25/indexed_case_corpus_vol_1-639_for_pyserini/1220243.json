{"id": "1220243", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThis appeal involves the construction of a will. The question is whether the interest herein is vested or contingent.\nTestatrix, a widow, was survived by three children: Edna Brosie, Viola Kendrick and Raymond Rickenbaeh. She directed payment of her debts and funeral expenses; devised one piece of real estate to Edna and another to Viola; by the fifth item she bequeathed her residuary per sonal estate to Edna and Viola share and share alike, providing that upon the death of either daughter before her death such share was to pass to such deceased daughter\u2019s \u201cthen living issue\u201d, and if no such grandchild survived, then such deceased daughter\u2019s share to go to the surviving daughter (Both daughters survived their mother, and the personal estate was divided between them). By the sixth clause, the residuary real estate was devised to three named trustees, of whom the appellant is the surviving trustee. This item is the only one in question. Its applicable words are as follows: \u201cSaid property is to be sold as soon as it can be sold without sacrificing the same, and the proceeds, . . . are to be divided between my two daughters, share and share alike; provided, however, that the then living lawful issue of either daughter shall take their Mother\u2019s share in the event of her death, . . . Until said real property is sold I direct that the said Trustees shall manage the same, collect the rents and distribute the net proceeds monthly between my two daughters, share and share alike; provided, however, that the then living lawful issue of either daughter shall take their Mother\u2019s share in the event of her death. . . .\u201d By item eight she directed : . In the event the provisions of my Will are questioned, and it is legally determined that the disposition of property hereinabove set forth is not in accordance with the law, then I give, devise and bequeath all of my property, of every kind, whether received from my late husband or not, to my two daughters absolutely. . .\nViola, one of the daughters, died without issue, after the death of the testatrix. She was survived by her husband (appellee) who was bequeathed her entire estate and named as executor. Appellee petitioned for, and secured, an order upon appellant (his wife\u2019s surviving sister) as surviving testamentary trustee under her mother\u2019s will, for an accounting of the rents from the trust of the residuary real estate. Appellee claimed a vested one half interest in the trust through the will of his deceased wife. Appellant resisted the order for accounting. She contended that her brother-in-law possesses no interest in the trust. Appellant maintains that her deceased sister, who died after the death of testatrix without issue, possessed but a contingent interest, which lapsed because of her death without issue before the proceeds were realized and distributed, and which under Section 15 (c) of the Wills Act of 1917, P. L. 403, 20 PS Section 253, passed to appellant as the other residuary devisee or legatee.\nThe court below decided that the appellee possessed a vested interest because (1) the share absolutely vested in interest at the date of the death of testatrix; (2) that there was a separate and antecedent gift of principal, independent of the direction and time for payment, which is implied because of the gift of income from the realty, without express provision for the disposition of the residue; (3) that there was no lapsing of Viola\u2019s interest as her interest was vested at her mother\u2019s death, and hence Section 15 (c) of the Wills Act of 1917, supra, has no application; (4) that the direction to convert the real estate and divide the proceeds did not defer the vesting of interest \u2014 distribution being merely postponed for convenience of the daughters and preservation of the estate.\nWe do not agree that under the terms of this will there was an absolute vesting in interest as of the date of the death of testatrix. The quality of this estate is best illustrated by Carstensen\u2019s Estate, 196 Pa. 325, 46 A. 495. There the remainder was \u201cto my brothers and sisters, the child or children of any who may then be dead to take the parent\u2019s share\u201d. A brother died without issue. It was held that the brother\u2019s remainder was vested, subject to be divested, should he die leaving children; that because such event had not occurred, his remainder was not divested. Were this construction not complicated by other considerations, we would be constrained to hold that Viola\u2019s share was vested, subject to be divested should she die with issue \u2014 which she did not \u2014 and that therefore her interest had not been divested. See Waln\u2019s Estate, 228 Pa. 259, 77 A. 458; Massey\u2019s Estate, 235 Pa. 289, 83 A. 1087; Neel\u2019s Estate, 252 Pa. 394, 97 A. 502; Rau\u2019s Estate, 254 Pa. 464, 98 A. 1068; McCauley\u2019s Estate, 257 Pa. 377, 101 A. 827.\nTestatrix made no gift over in the event that Viola should die without issue. Neither is there anything in the will from which survivorship may be implied. There is no lapsed bequest because Viola did not die in her mother\u2019s lifetime. Section 15 (c) of the Wills Act of 1917, supra, only applies where the beneficiary dies in the lifetime of testatrix. It does not affect an undisposed of share: Knox\u2019s Estate (No. 2), 328 Pa. 188, 195 A. 34.\nWhatever doubt which may exist concerning the construction of this will arises because of testatrix\u2019s direction to sell the real estate and to divide the proceeds.\nThere are perhaps no more technical and perplexing problems of will construction than those found in the commonly termed \u201cpay and divide\u201d cases. Chief Justice Kephart observed in Alburger\u2019s Estate (No. 2), 274 Pa. 15, 117 A. 452, that while the numerous adjudicated cases appear in accord in enunciating the correct legal principles, yet they do not always appear to be harmonious in applying the principles to the varying language, in context, in the numerous wills construed. On p. 18 he wrote: \u201c. . . it would be more than difficult for the writer of this opinion to follow the finely spun threads of difference used in emphasizing the distinguishing element of each\u201d. Justice Schaerer (later Chief Justice) \u201csympathetically quotes\u201d this statement with approval: Hood\u2019s Estate, 323 Pa. 253, 259, 186 A. 740. A study of the present will, and the re-examination of the cases, confirms the force and accuracy of these authoritative observations.\nWe have repeatedly decided that where there is a direction to pay and divide, but there is no separate and antecedent gift which is independent of the direction and time for payment, tlie legacy is contingent. The reason for the rule is that the gift itself is only implied from a direction to pay. Such a gift is necessarily inseparable from the direction, and hence must partake of its quality. If the direction is future and contingent so must the gift be.\nThe rule is illustrated in the early case of Moore v. Smith, 9 Watts 403, where the words are: \u201c. . . pay unto my grandson \u00a3 100 . . . as soon as he arrives to be twenty-one years of age\u201d. It was held that such bequest was contingent, and lapsed upon the death of the grandson before attaining that age. Had the gift been made to the grandson, but payment deferred until he arrived at that age, it would have been vested. In the first illustration it was solely the direction to pay that constituted the bequest, hence the vesting in interest was postponed. In the second, there was a separate and antecedent gift, but merely a deferment of possession. The principal appellate cases are: Reiff's Ap., 124 Pa. 145, 16 A. 636; Kountz\u2019s Est., 213 Pa. 390, 62 A. 1103; Rosengarten v. Ashton, 228 Pa. 389, 77 A. 562; Evans\u2019s Est., 264 Pa. 357, 107 A. 731; Hildebrant\u2019s Est., 268 Pa. 132, 110 A. 760; Alburger\u2019s Est. (No. 2), supra; Berg\u2019s Est., 96 Pa. Superior Ct. 125; Feeney\u2019s Est., 293 Pa. 273, 142 A. 284; Scott\u2019s Est., 301 Pa. 509, 152 A. 560; Hood\u2019s Est., supra.\nThere are many other cases, however, which held that even though there be no other gift than the direction to pay or distribute in futuro, if such gift or distribution appears to be postponed for the convenience of the fund or property, or to let in some other interest, the vesting will not be deferred until the period in question. The question is one of substance and not of form. Such intent must be gathered from the entire will. The inquiry is not restricted to the particular words in which the gift is made. Thus in McClure\u2019s Appeal, infra, the bequest was to the widow for life and upon her death . . my real estate to be sold and equally divided amongst my nephews and nieces. , , ,\u201d It was held that the remainders were vested because it was \u201cmanifest from the whole face of the will\u201d that a division upon the widow\u2019s death was not intended to be a condition precedent to vesting but was merely a postponement of the time fixed for enjoyment. See McClure\u2019s Appeal, 72 Pa. 414; Man\u2019s Est., 160 Pa. 609, 28 A. 939; Thomman\u2019s Est., 161 Pa. 444, 29 A. 84; Ritter\u2019s Est., 190 Pa. 102, 42 A. 384; Rau\u2019s Est., supra; Stocker\u2019s Est., 260 Pa. 385, 103 A. 885; Marshall\u2019s Est., 262 Pa. 145, 105 A. 63; Jennings\u2019s Est., 266 Pa. 60, 109 A. 544; Groninger\u2019s Est., 268 Pa. 184, 110 A. 465; Edelman\u2019s Est., 276 Pa. 503, 120 A. 457; Brown\u2019s Est., 289 Pa. 101, 137 A. 132; Wallace\u2019s Est., 299 Pa. 333, 149 A. 473; Lloyd\u2019s Est., 326 Pa. 230, 192 A. 98; Knerr\u2019s Est., 130 Pa. Superior Ct. 383, 197 A. 528.\nWe do not agree with the court below that, in the present language, there exists a separate and antecedent gift which is independent of the direction and time for payment. Neither can such gift be implied therefrom. True a gift of income without limit of time is an absolute vested bequest of the corpus itself: McKinstry\u2019s Estate, 296 Pa. 185, 145 A. 806; Estate of Henry Osborn, 88 Pa. Superior Ct. 7; Emmerich Estate, 347 Pa. 307, 310. But the gift in this will is limited in time. The income was given only ciuntil said real property is sold\u2019\u2019. Furthermore, it is provided that if a daughter dies, her share is to be paid to her \u201cthen living lawful issue\u201d. Thus such payment of income to a daughter is only to be continued until the real estate is sold, and pending such sale, is limited to the life of the daughter.\nHowever, from a careful consideration of the language of the entire will, we are convinced that the court beloAV correctly concluded that testatrix\u2019s deferments in distribution was not intended to operate as a condition precedent to vesting. The estates bequeathed to the daughters, as above indicated, were vested, subject to be divested should either die leaving issue after the death of testatrix but before the real estate \\vas sold and the proceeds divided. As the daughter Viola died, without issue, her estate was not divested.\nThis view is strengthened when it is considered that if the view of appellant were adopted, and Viola\u2019s share be regarded as contingent, it would lead to an intestacy. It is a well settled canon of construction that an interest is to be construed contingent only when it is impossible to construe it vested: Rau\u2019s Est., supra; Brown\u2019s Est., supra; Weir\u2019s Est., 307 Pa. 461, 161 A. 730; Lafferty\u2019s Est. (No. 1), 311 Pa. 455, 167 A. 44. There is a presumption in favor of vesting: Shaw\u2019s Est., 326 Pa. 456, 191 A. 159. Furthermore, the absence of a gift over upon the decease of a daughter without leaving issue is an indication of vesting, especially if intestacy would result: Mc-Cauley\u2019s Est., supra, at 381. It is likewise significant that in disposing of her residuary personal estate testatrix passed an absolute vested estate to her two daughters in the event that they survived her \u2014 as they did.\nAppellee, being possessed of a vested interest in one half of this trust and being the sole executor of his deceased wife\u2019s estate, may demand and receive an accounting from the surviving testamentary trustee. The estate of his deceased wife is entitled to one half of all unpaid income until the date of her death. Appellee, as sole beneficiary under his wife\u2019s will, is thereafter entitled to one half of all net income until the real estate is sold, and to one half of the corpus upon such conversion.\nWe cannot, however, affirm the decree as entered upon the opinions filed by the court. It was error to decide that \u201cupon confirmation of the account to be filed by the trustee, the trust will be terminated and the trustee discharged\u201d. This trust must continue, according to its terms, until the real estate is sold and the proceeds divided. Appellant and appellee are not the only parties in interest. Should the appellant die leaving issue before such sale and distribution her interest would be divested. As some of the parties in interest cannot as yet be ascertained, those who may happen to be living may not alone agree to terminate the trust: Lewis\u2019s Est., 231 Pa. 60, 79 A. 921; Henry\u2019s Est., 53 Pa. Superior Ct. 57; Stew art\u2019s Est., 253 Pa. 277, 98 A. 569; Bennett\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 397, 113 A. 685; Buch\u2019s Est., 278 Pa. 185, 122 A. 239; Johnson et al. v. Provident Tr. Co. of Phila., 280 Pa. 255, 124 A. 436; Reighard\u2019s Est., 283 Pa. 140, 128 A. 847.\nThe decree of the court below directing an accounting, as herein modified, is affirmed. The costs in this appeal to be paid from the principal of the trust."}
