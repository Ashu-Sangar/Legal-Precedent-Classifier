{"id": "1051931", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis action was brought to recover from the First National Bank of Huntingdon, Pa., the amounts which it paid on four checks bearing alleged forged countersignatures of a referee in bankruptcy. These forgeries were discovered by the appellant in the fall of 1916, but no notice of them was given to the bank until May, 1918, and the learned trial judge properly directed a verdict for the defendant: McNeely v. Bank of North America, 221 Pa. 588.\nJudgment affirmed."}
