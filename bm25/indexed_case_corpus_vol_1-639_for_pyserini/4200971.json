Allocatur is DENIED as to all remaining issues. The issue, as stated by petitioner, is:\nDoes the Superior Court\u2019s decision overturning [respondent\u2019s] first-degree murder conviction contradict this Court\u2019s precedent holding that: (A) one who instigates or continues the underlying difficulty may not later claim self-defense; (B) deadly force may not be used against an unarmed victim who is backing away, and thus no longer poses a threat; and (C) even when a prima facie case of self-defense is presented, a trial court has discretion to exclude evidence of a victim\u2019s prior criminal convictions that were remote in time?"}
