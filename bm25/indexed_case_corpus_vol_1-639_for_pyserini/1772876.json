{"id": "1772876", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is a direct appeal from judgments of sentence imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia upon three citations of criminal contempt entered against appellant during trial. The court cited and sentenced appellant summarily as each of the contempts occurred. A sentence of six months\u2019 imprisonment was imposed upon each of the citations, and the sentences were ordered to run consecutively-\nAppellant challenges both the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the contempt convictions and the legality of the court\u2019s summary procedure. We reject appellant\u2019s contentions and, hence, affirm.\nUnderlying each of the three contempt convictions was appellant\u2019s persistent insistence upon the right to dismiss his court-appointed attorney. Appellant initiated his demand immediately before closing arguments were scheduled to begin. At that time the court dismissed the jury from the courtroom and conducted a colloquy with appellant. The colloquy revealed appellant\u2019s dissatisfaction with his counsel\u2019s strategy during trial, particularly the failure to call several witnesses and to ask certain questions. The court, however, denied appellant\u2019s request to dismiss his attorney and to obtain new counsel. After the court\u2019s ruling, the following ensued, resulting in the first contempt conviction:\n\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: Well, he ain\u2019t going to represent me. He ain\u2019t going to argue. You may as well get your contempt book out. I ain\u2019t going to allow him to say nothing.\nTHE COURT: What would you do if he tried to speak in your behalf?\nTHE DEFENDANT: I ain\u2019t going to let him.\nTHE COURT: What do you mean you wouldn\u2019t let him?\nTHE DEFENDANT: I am going to disrupt this courtroom because I don\u2019t want him to defend me no more. I want me another lawyer.\nTHE COURT: I am denying your request for another lawyer.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Okay, you can deny it. I told you what I am going to do.\nTHE COURT: You will be in very serious trouble with this Court, I will tell you now, if you disrupt the courtroom.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I am in very serious trouble now. I ain\u2019t going anywhere. The only thing I want is a fair trial. If I can\u2019t get a fair trial, I will get nothing.\nTHE COURT: You are getting a fair trial.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I am not getting a fair trial.\nTHE COURT: Sit down, Mr. Owens.\nMR. FREEMAN [defense counsel]: Your Honor, it has been brought to my attention \u2014 perhaps we should simply place Mr. Owens under oath. Of course, he has been placed under oath already. I would like to conduct some sort of colloquy as to what his desires are in this case, that is whether he has been advised that he has a right to counsel, to have counsel close in his behalf and he has the right to have counsel call witnesses and to cross-examine them.\nTHE COURT: Mr. Owens, come up.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I ain\u2019t getting up.\nTHE COURT: Sheriff. This is not a joke, it is a courtroom.\n(Whereupon, the defendant caused a disturbance in the courtroom.)\nTHE COURT: Now, Mr. Owens, I am holding you in contempt. I saw you disrupt this courtroom.\nTHE DEFENDANT: He snatched the chair from underneath me.\nTHE COURT: I am sentencing you to six months in jail for contempt.\nTHE DEFENDANT: He snatched the chair from underneath me.\nTHE COURT: Keep quiet. I am sentencing you to six months in jail to follow any term you are now serving. You will not get another attorney. Is it your wish that your present attorney, Mr. Richard Freeman, not speak on your behalf and not address this jury? Well, Mr. Owens.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Give me another contempt.\nTHE COURT: You refuse to answer?\nMR. FREEMAN: Nat, answer.\nTHE COURT: Put him down there. Sit down, Mr. Owens.\nMr. Freeman, you may sit over there. Bring the jury back.\u201d\nThe statements and conduct leading up to the second contempt conviction occurred immediately after the jury had returned to the courtroom:\n\u201cMR. FREEMAN: Your Honor, may I approach the jury?\nTHE COURT: Yes.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this man \u2014 I have dismissed this attorney, he is not representing me anymore. I have a right to my own attorney and I am not satisfied with the way he is representing me. I am dismissing him. I don\u2019t want him to close out the arguments for me.\nTHE COURT: You had your say. Sit down, Mr. Owens.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t want him to represent me anymore.\nTHE COURT: I told you to sit down.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t want him here anymore.\nTHE COURT: Sheriff, take him over and sit him down.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t want him to represent me. I don\u2019t want him to speak on my behalf.\nTHE COURT: I told you in the absence of the jury what is going to happen. Your attorney feels\u2014\nTHE DEFENDANT: I have a right to my own lawyer, I don\u2019t want him to represent me.\nTHE COURT: You have to pay for your own lawyer.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I will pay for one.\nTHE COURT: You asked for the Defender\u2019s Association.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I didn\u2019t ask for the Defender\u2019s Association.\nTHE COURT: Don\u2019t be disruptive.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I want my own lawyer.\nTHE COURT: Not another word.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I want my own lawyer. I don\u2019t want him to talk for me.\nTHE COURT: I am going to hold you in contempt again.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Hold me in contempt. I want my own lawyer.\nTHE COURT: I am sentencing you to an additional six months in jail for contempt to follow all sentences that you are now serving.\u201d\nNotwithstanding this second contempt conviction, the defendant persisted in his defiance of the court\u2019s denial of his request to dismiss his attorney:\n\u201cTHE DEFENDANT: I still want my own lawyer.\nTHE COURT: Sit down.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t want him to, you know, represent me.\nTHE COURT: Everybody has heard you.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Still, I don\u2019t want him to say nothing in my behalf.\nTHE COURT: Do not be disruptive.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I want the rights that I am supposed to get. I want a fair trial.\nTHE COURT: All your rights have been protected.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t want him to represent me.\nTHE COURT: You have said it.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Tell him not to say anything about me or the case. I want my own attorney.\nTHE COURT: I am sentencing you to another six months in jail for contempt and that is to follow all the sentences I have given you.\nTHE DEFENDANT: You can give me a thousand years.\nMR. FREEMAN: I move for a mistrial in this case.\nTHE COURT: I will grant your request for a mistrial in this case. I am declaring a mistrial in this case.\nIncidentally, ladies and gentlemen, he is one of those Holmesburg escapees. You will serve those eighteen months, Mr. Owens. This case will be immediately relisted for trial.\nTHE DEFENDANT: Thank you.\nTHE COURT: Don\u2019t thank me. I am sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This occurs all the time with disruptive defendants who are belligerent and hostile. You have seen one example. I regret we had to declare a mistrial. We will be going through this again. Thank you very much.\u201d\nI. Sufficiency of the Evidence.\nAppellant asserts that the evidence of record does not satisfy the elements of criminal contempt. 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 4131, upon which the contempt judgments rest, provides:\n\u201cThe power of the several courts of this Commonwealth to issue attachments and to inflict summary punishment for contempts of court shall be restricted to the following cases:\n(3) The misbehavior of any person in the presence of the court, thereby obstructing the administration of justice.\u201d\nAs this Court recently stated in Commonwealth v. Reid, 494 Pa. 201, 208, 431 A.2d 218, 222 (1981), \u201c[sjubsection III requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of (1) misconduct, (2) in the presence of the court, (3) committed with intent to obstruct the proceedings, which (4) obstructs the administration of justice. Commonwealth v. Garrison, 478 Pa. 356, 371, 386 A.2d 971, 979 (1978).\u201d Appellant argues that the record is insufficient to support a finding of \u201cmisconduct\u201d for the first contempt conviction. He also argues that all three contempt convictions are invalid because proof of the requisite element of intent is lacking.\nIn attacking the first contempt conviction for want of evidence of misconduct, appellant claims that the only indication of misconduct is contained in the courtroom stenographer\u2019s notation, \u201cthe defendant caused a disturbance in the courtroom.\u201d We reject appellant\u2019s narrow view of the record. Apart from the stenographer\u2019s notation, there is ample evidence of record to support the court\u2019s finding of miscon-' duct at the time of the first contempt conviction. Not only had appellant repeatedly protested the court\u2019s denial of his request to dismiss his lawyer, but appellant had also stated his intention to disrupt the courtroom. When a disturbance took place between appellant and the sheriff, the court reported that disturbance on the record. Manifestly, the record sufficiently demonstrates misconduct. See Commonwealth v. Snyder, 443 Pa. 433, 275 A.2d 312 (1971) (defendant\u2019s interruption of closing arguments contemptuous).\nAppellant argues that all three contempt convictions should be set aside because \u201chis intent was not to obstruct justice, but to be in his view an effective advocate for himself.\u201d This argument, however, misconceives the element of intent required for summary conviction of criminal contempt. Commonwealth v. Reid, supra, like earlier cases, makes clear that a subjective intent to obstruct the administration of justice is not a requisite element of criminal contempt. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Africa, 466 Pa. 603, 353 A.2d 855 (1976) (plurality). The requisite element of intent is satisfied if the contemnor has the intent to obstruct the proceedings. When that intent manifests itself in misconduct in the presence of the court which, as on this record, in fact obstructs the administration of justice, criminal contempt has been committed.\nII. Adequacy of Summary Procedure.\nAppellant challenges the summary nature of his criminal contempt convictions. Relying upon Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U.S. 506, 94 S.Ct. 2687, 41 L.Ed.2d 912 (1974), he argues that, because the aggregate of the sentences imposed exceeds six months\u2019 imprisonment, he should have been afforded the right to a jury trial. Appellant\u2019s reliance is misplaced. Codispoti holds that the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial on multiple charges of direct criminal contempt when two conditions are satisfied: (1) the court postpones adjudication and sentence for contempt until the end of trial; and (2) the court imposes sentences which either alone, or when aggregated, exceed six months\u2019 imprisonment. The rationale underlying the rule enunciated in Codispoti is that, unlike during trial, at the end of trial there is \u201cno overriding necessity for instant action to preserve order and no justification for dispensing with the ordinary rudiments of due process.\u201d Id., 418 U.S. at 515, 94 S.Ct. at 2692. Because on this record the charges of criminal contempt were adjudicated and punished during trial as the contemptuous conduct occurred, and because no individual sentence for contempt exceeded six months\u2019 imprisonment, appellant was not entitled to a jury trial. Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, supra; Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 20 L.Ed.2d 522 (1968).\nAppellant\u2019s remaining challenge, that the summary procedure denied him due process of law, is equally without merit. Contrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, it is clear that, prior to summarily citing and punishing appellant for contempt, the court gave appellant sufficient notice that his conduct was contemptuous and sufficient opportunity to desist. Nor does this case present, as appellant contends, a \u201crunning bitter controversy\u201d between the judge and appellant which would have required the judge to recuse himself and refer trial to another judge. Compare Mayberry v. Pennsylvania, 400 U.S. 455, 91 S.Ct. 499, 27 L.Ed.2d 532 (1971) with Commonwealth v. Patterson, 452 Pa. 457, 308 A.2d 90 (1973).\nAs the American Bar Association Standards state, \u201c[t]he only purpose of a criminal trial is to determine whether the prosecution has established the guilt of the accused as required by law, and the trial judge should not allow the proceedings to be used for any other purpose.\u201d ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Function of the Trial Judge \u00a7 1.1 (Approved Draft, 1972). Here, the trial judge properly used his power \u201cto cite and, if necessary, punish summarily anyone who, in his presence in open court, willfully obstructs the course of criminal proceedings.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 7.1.\nBecause the evidence of record satisfies each of the elements of criminal contempt, we affirm judgments of sentence.\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.\n. This appeal was filed under the former version of 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 722, which conferred jurisdiction upon this Court of appeals from sentences imposed upon citations of direct criminal contempt in the courts of common pleas.\n. Record at 5-9.\n. Record at 9-11.\n. Record at 11-12.\n. Appellant\u2019s brief at 16.\n. Appellant further suggests that the trial court induced his contemptuous behavior by failing to advise him that he could proceed pro se. Where the accused does not request to represent himself before trial, the constitutional right to self-representation recognized in Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), is not implicated. When, during the course of trial, an accused wishes to dismiss counsel and either represent himself or obtain new counsel, his request is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court. See United States v. Dunlap, 577 F.2d 867, 868-69 (4th Cir.), cert, denied, 439 U.S. 858, 99 S.Ct. 174, 58 L.Ed.2d 166 (1978); Sapienza v. Vincent, 534 F.2d 1007, 1010 (2d Cir. 1976); United States v. Dellinger, 472 F.2d 340, 408 (7th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 970, 93 S.Ct. 1443, 35 L.Ed.2d 706 (1973); Smith v. United States, 353 F.2d 838, 845 (D.C. Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 384 U.S. 910, 86 S.Ct. 1350, 16 L.Ed.2d 362 (1966). See also ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Providing Defense Services \u00a7 5.3 (Approved Draft, 1968). Of course, as with any asserted trial court error, the proper procedure by which to seek relief from the denial of such a request is through the orderly process of appellate review, not through contemptuous behavior."}
