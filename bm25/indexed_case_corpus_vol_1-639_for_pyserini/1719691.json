{"id": "1719691", "contents": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nAppellant pled guilty to a charge of voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to a prison term of six to twelve years. He appealed to this Court from a denial of his petition for post-conviction relief.\nAn examination of the colloquy reveals that the trial judge failed to explain to appellant the nature and elements of the charges against him. Because this failure rendered the plea legally involuntary, we reverse appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence. Commonwealth v. Minor, 467 Pa. 230, 356 A.2d 346 (1976); Commonwealth v. Schork, 467 Pa. 248, 356 A.2d 355 (1976); Commonwealth v. Ingram, 455 Pa. 198, 316 A.2d 77 (1974).\nReversed and remanded for a new trial.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nJONES, C. J., and EAGEN, J., dissent.\nThis appeal was not preceded by the filing of a petition in the trial court for withdrawal of the guilty plea, which is the proper method for challenging a plea of guilty. Commonwealth v. Lee, 460 Pa. 324, 327 n., 333 A.2d 749, 750 n. (1975); Commonwealth v. Zakrzewski, 460 Pa. 528, 327 n. 1, 333 A.2d 898, 900 n. 1 (1975); Commonwealth v. Starr, 450 Pa. 485, 488, 301 A.2d 592, 594 (1973).\nSince, however, the adequacy of the colloquy can be decided on the record before us, we will consider the merits of the appeal. Commonwealth v. Lee, supra, at 327, 333 A.2d at 750 n. See also Commonwealth v. Minor, 467 Pa. 230, 356 A.2d 346 (1976) (dissenting opinion n. 1)."}
