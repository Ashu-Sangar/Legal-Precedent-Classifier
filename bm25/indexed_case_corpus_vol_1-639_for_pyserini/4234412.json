{"id": "4234412", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice SAYLOR.\nAppeal was allowed to consider whether sheriffs and their deputies have the authority independently to establish and conduct suspicionless roadside sobriety checkpoints.\nI. Background\nSection 6308(b) of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308(b), prescribes that a \u201cpolice officer\u201d engaged in a systematic program of checking vehicles or drivers may stop vehicles to secure information to enforce the provisions of the title. Such provisions include the prohibition against driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances (\u201cDUI\u201d). See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3802.\nIn September 2007, sheriffs and deputies of the Forest and Warren County Sheriffs\u2019 Departments (the \u201cSheriffs\u201d) established a temporary sobriety checkpoint in Forest County. Appellee drove a vehicle into the checkpoint, was stopped, manifested signs of alcohol use, and underwent field sobriety and chemical testing. Based on the results, he was arrested and charged with DUI and other offenses.\nAppellee challenged the authority of the Sheriffs to conduct suspicionless stops and sought suppression of all evidence obtained as a result of his detention. He invoked a line of this Court\u2019s decisions holding that, absent specific statutory authorization, sheriffs are not \u201cpolice\u201d or \u201claw enforcement\u201d officers authorized to conduct independent investigations where no breach of the peace or felony has been committed in their presence. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Dobbins, 594 Pa. 71, 934 A.2d 1170 (2007) (holding that sheriffs lacked the authority to conduct independent investigations under the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 780-101-780-144); Kopko v. Miller, 586 Pa. 170, 892 A.2d 766 (2006) (holding that sheriffs are not authorized to conduct independent investigations under the authority of the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Act, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5703-5728). More specifically, Appellee contended that the Sheriffs are not \u201cpolice officers\u201d for purposes of Section 6308(b) of the Vehicle Code. Thus, Appellee asserted, the stop was illegal, implicating the exclusionary rule.\nThe Commonwealth countered that sheriffs\u2019 authority to enforce the Vehicle Code was established in Commonwealth v. Leet, 537 Pa. 89, 641 A.2d 299 (1994) (holding that duly-trained sheriffs and their deputies have authority to make warrantless arrests for motor vehicle violations committed in their presence). In particular, the Commonwealth stressed Leet\u2019s relianee on the historical, common-law powers of sheriffs, as follows:\nUnless the sheriffs common law power to make warrantless arrests for breaches of the peace committed in his presence has been abrogated, it is clear that a sheriff (and his deputies) may make arrests for motor vehicle violations which amount to breaches of the peace committed in their presence. Thus, we search the statute[, i.e., the Vehicle Code,] for authority abrogating the common law power of the sheriff, rather than statutory authority for the sheriff to enforce the law \u2014 authority he has always possessed under common law. In other words, although the Superior Court searched in vain for a provision which grants the sheriff an enforcement power under the motor vehicle laws, it is instead necessary to search for a statutory provision which removes the enforcement power of the sheriff (which preexisted the statute). The latter search is equally vain; there is, in the motor vehicle code, no unequivocal abrogation of the sheriffs common law power to arrest. It is evident, moreover, that the power to arrest subsumes the power to stop, detain, and investigate a motorist who breaches the peace while operating a motor vehicle in the presence of the sheriff.\nIn short, it is not necessary to find a motor vehicle code provision granting to sheriffs the power to enforce the code \u2014 sheriffs have had the power and duty to enforce the laws since before the Magna Carta; rather, it would be necessary to find an unequivocal provision in the code abrogating the sheriffs power in order to conclude that the sheriff may not enforce the code.\nId. at 96, 641 A.2d at 303 (emphasis added; footnote omitted). The Commonwealth highlighted that there simply is no provision in the Vehicle Code abrogating a duly-trained sheriffs\u2019 power to enforce its prescriptions using sobriety checkpoints. Furthermore, the Commonwealth observed, in Penn. DOT v. Kline, 559 Pa. 646, 741 A.2d 1281 (1999), this Court relied on Leet in condoning the use of a checkpoint by sheriffs and their deputies. See id. at 655, 741 A.2d at 1286 (holding that a deputy sheriff was authorized to enforce the Vehicle Code, through implementation of its implied consent provision, at a sobriety checkpoint).\nThe common pleas court agreed with Appellee\u2019s position and awarded suppression. See Commonwealth v. Marconi, No. 95 of 2007, slip op. (C.P. Forest Apr. 29, 2009). In its reasoning, the court applied the line of decisions reinforcing the limits of sheriffs\u2019 common-law powers and holding that express statutory authority is necessary to support an independent exercise of investigative powers by sheriffs. See id., slip op. at 2-8 (citing Dobbins, 594 Pa. at 71, 934 A.2d at 1170, and Kopko, 586 Pa. at 170, 892 A.2d at 766). While, in relation to the Vehicle Code, the common pleas court recognized that such limitation manifests some disharmony with the broader language employed by the Court in Leet and Kline, the court responded with the observation that \u201cKline was decided before the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in Dobbins and Kopko and did not have the benefit of these later holdings.\u201d Marconi, No. 95 of 2007, slip op. at 3 (explaining that, in the more current opinions, \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s focus has turned to the investigative powers normally reserved for police officers and not sheriffs\u201d).\nThe common pleas court found this distinction between investigation and arrest to be of particular significance in the arena of sobriety checkpoints, since suspicionless stops implicate sensitive constitutional rights. The court explained:\n\u201cDUI roadblocks are an exception to a citizen\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to protection from unreasonable search and seizures and an exception to the protections afforded the citizens under Article I, Section [8] of the Pennsylvania Constitution\u201d and found in the requirements of Comm[onwealth] v. Blouse [531 Pa. 167], 611 A.2d 1177 (Pa.1992) and Comm[onwealth] v. Tarbert [517 Pa. 277], 535 A.2d 1035 (Pa.1987). A DUI roadblock is inherently investigatory in nature. At a DUI roadblock a citizen is stopped, seized, and investigated as to whether or not he has been drinking. It is only after the end of the investigation that the citizen is allowed to continue or an arrest is made. This situation is quite different from a sheriffs witnessing a driver operating a vehicle while intoxicated and pulling him over for that reason because at a DUI roadblock there is no determination of a driver[\u2019]s sobriety until after the driver\u2019s rights have been abrogated and he has been investigated by officers.\nMarconi, No. 95 of 2007, slip op. at 4 (quoting Commonwealth v. Culp, No. 67 of 2006, slip op. at 4 (C.P. Forest Oct. 9, 2008)).\nFinally, the common pleas court acknowledged that the Vehicle Code contains a broad definition of \u201cpolice officer\u201d as a \u201cnatural person authorized by law to make arrests for violations of law.\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102. Nevertheless, the court observed that this Court\u2019s recent decisions reflect that, \u201cwhen dealing with investigatory powers authorized by statute that intrude upon fundamental constitutional rights, the statute must be strictly construed.\u201d Marconi, No. 95 of 2007, slip op. at 4 (citing Dobbins, 594 Pa. at 85-87, 934 A.2d at 1179-80).\nOn the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal, the Superior Court affirmed based on reasoning similar to that of the common pleas court. See Commonwealth v. Marconi, 996 A.2d 1070, 1075 (Pa.Super.2010) (\u201c[W]e decline to find that the common law authority of sheriffs includes the power to conduct an investigation in the form of a DUI roadblock when such conduct implicates serious constitutional rights of the citizens of this Commonwealth.\u201d). Responding to the Commonwealth\u2019s reliance on Kline, the Superior Court distinguished the decision as addressing sheriffs\u2019 powers of arrest, as opposed to the authority to conduct and operate checkpoints or suspicionless stops. See id. at 1072 n. 2. We allowed appeal to undertake plenary review of the correctness of the common pleas and intermediate courts\u2019 legal rulings.\nPresently, the Commonwealth recognizes the inherent limitations on sheriffs\u2019 powers in settings other than the Vehicle Code. Nevertheless, it maintains that Leet and Kline establish that duly-trained sheriffs and their deputies are \u201cpolice officers\u201d for purposes of Vehicle Code enforcement. See, e.g., Brief for Appellant at 11. The Commonwealth criticizes the Superior Court for distinguishing Kline, since, in the Commonwealth\u2019s view, the authority to conduct the sobriety checkpoint and the power of arrest were inextricably intertwined in Kline, as the Commonwealth asserts they also are in the present case. See id. at 16 (asserting that the Kline Court \u201cdid not just speak in terms of only one aspect of enforcement \u2014 i.e., arrest \u2014 but more collectively about the activity in general\u201d). The Commonwealth also faults the common pleas and intermediate courts for looking to the Vehicle Code for express authority for sheriffs to establish and conduct sobriety checkpoints. In this respect, the Commonwealth points to Leet\u2019s instruction that the opposite approach \u2014 looking to whether the Code abrogates the enforcement authority of sheriffs \u2014 is the appropriate one. See Leet, 537 Pa. at 96, 641 A.2d at 303.\nII. Discussion\nAs reflected above, binding majority decisions of this Court confirm the general understanding that express statutory authorization is required for independent investigations by sheriffs and/or their deputies implicating constitutionally-protected interests of the citizenry. See Dobbins, 594 Pa. at 87-89, 934 A.2d at 1180-81; Kopko, 586 Pa. at 190-91, 892 A.2d at 778-79. Suspicionless stops, such as those occurring at sobriety checkpoints, are plainly investigatory in nature and just as clearly implicate citizens\u2019 constitutional interests. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Blouse, 531 Pa. 167, 611 A.2d 1177 (1992) (adopting a set of guidelines to square roadside checkpoints with constitutional protections against unreasonable seizures). Accordingly, in the absence of express statutory authorization, a straightforward application of the general rule precludes sheriffs and their deputies from independently establishing and conducting sobriety checkpoints.\nThe Commonwealth, however, counters that the required express legislative authorization already has been found by this Court, in its Leet and Kline decisions, within the Vehicle Code\u2019s definition of \u201cpolice officer\u201d as a \u201cnatural person authorized by law to make arrests for violations of law.\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102. The argument goes that, because sheriffs have common-law arrest powers, they fall squarely within this definition.\nIn point of fact, the seminal decision, Leet, never framed or addressed the authority question on such terms. Rather, the Leet Court rejected the intermediate court\u2019s resolution of the authority question as a matter of statutory interpretation, and, instead, treated that court\u2019s central determination that the Vehicle Code\u2019s \u201cdesignation [of \u2018police officer\u2019] ... does not include the sheriff or his deputies\u201d as an irrelevancy. Leet, 537 Pa. at 92-97, 641 A.2d at 301-03. Leet focused entirely on sheriffs\u2019 common-law powers \u2014 more specifically the authority to arrest for in-presence breaches of the peace \u2014 and concluded that the only relevant statutory consideration was whether any express negation of that authority was to be found in the Vehicle Code. See id. at 96, 641 A.2d at 303.\nKline, on the other hand, did initially frame the question presented as involving the Vehicle Code definition of \u201cpolice officer.\u201d See Kline, 559 Pa. at 648, 741 A.2d at 1281. Nevertheless, the dispositive issue in Kline centered upon a collateral concern pertaining to the extent of a deputy sheriffs training. See id. at 651-55, 741 A.2d at 1283-86. In terms of the underlying authority issue, the Kline Court never addressed or answered the definitional question which it framed. Rather, the relevant passages in the dispositional section of the opinion merely restate Leet\u2019s analysis and conclusion that sheriffs have the authority to enforce the Vehicle Code by virtue of their historical function as peace officers. See id. at 650-51, 741 A.2d at 1283.\nIndeed, this Court has previously highlighted this point, i.e., that neither Leet nor Kline credited the argument that sheriffs are \u201cpolice officers\u201d under the Vehicle Code definition. See, e.g., Kopko, 586 Pa. at 183, 892 A.2d at 774 (explaining that, \u201calthough the Court in Leet and Kline recognized the common law authority of deputy sheriffs to make arrests, it did not discover any legislative authority empowering them to act as police officers \u201d (quoting Kopko v. Miller, 842 A.2d 1028, 1039 (2004) (emphasis added))). Instead, Leet and its progeny reflect \u201conly that [s]heriffs are authorized to issue summonses for summary offenses and to make sight arrests for Vehicle Code violations involving breaches of the peace committed in their presence.\u201d Kopko, 586 Pa. at 184, 892 A.2d at 774 (emphasis added); see also Dobbins, 594 Pa. at 87-88, 934 A.2d at 1180 (\u201cFaced[, in Kopko,] with sheriffs\u2019 assertion of much more investigative authority than this Court previously had faced, we clarified that Leet acknowledged nothing more than sheriffs\u2019 circumscribed authority to arrest for breaches of the peace and felonies committed in their presence, power \u2018no different from that of a private citizen.'\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted; emphasis in original).\nMoving from the case law to the actual terms of the Vehicle Code\u2019s definition of \u201cpolice officer,\u201d we acknowledge that, facially, the provision applies broadly to anyone with a power of arrest. See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102. Under the Statutory Construction Act, however, we presume that the General Assembly did not intend unreasonable results. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922. In this circumstance, a literal reading of the Vehicle Code\u2019s definition of \u201cpolice officer\u201d would invest enforcement authority in all citizens, in light of their common-law arrest power. See generally Commonwealth v. Chermansky, 430 Pa. 170, 173, 242 A.2d 237, 239-40 (1968) (referencing the citizens\u2019 authority to arrest). It is manifest, however, that the Legislature did not intend to denominate the citizenry at large as \u201cpolice officers\u201d or confer vehicle-related enforcement authority upon it. Thus, we find that the Legislature\u2019s definitional reference to the authorization \u201cby law to make arrests for violations of law,\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102, refers to some form of legal authorization beyond a mere common-law power shared among Pennsylvania citizens. Since such shared power represents the extent of sheriffs\u2019 arrest authority as determined by prevailing precedent (and in the absence of specific expansion by the Legislature), we conclude that sheriffs and their deputies are not \u201cpolice officers\u201d under the Vehicle Code.\nThis conclusion does not alter the prevailing regime under Leet. Despite that the decision is not a fully-reasoned one, we have accepted, and continue to accept, that duly-trained sheriffs may enforce provisions of the Vehicle Code to the limits of their common-law peacekeeping authority, as articulated in Leet. In this regard, Leet effectively superimposed those powers onto the Vehicle Code, while judicially inserting a training requirement into the statute, see Leet, 537 Pa. at 96-97, 641 A.2d at 303 (\u201cIt is certainly within the proper functioning of government and in keeping with the realities of the modern world to require adequate training of those who enforce the \u25a0 law with firearms.\u201d), apparently to ameliorate undesirable ramifications of its holding which otherwise would have ensued. The decision has remained in full force and effect for the better part of twenty years, during which period the Legislature has been free to modify it (consistent with constitutional norms). Thus, sheriffs\u2019 common-law peacekeeping powers as articulated in Leet have been, and remain, integrated into the Vehicle Code\u2019s framework.\nAccordingly, Leet and its progeny support the Commonwealth\u2019s position that sheriffs may independently establish and conduct sobriety checkpoints only to the extent that it may be shown that such checkpoints were subsumed within sheriffs\u2019 common-law peacekeeping powers, as conceived in Leet.\nAccording to the Commonwealth, Kline confirms that such powers subsume sheriffs\u2019 authority to independently establish and operate sobriety checkpoints, since in that case this Court approved the actions of a deputy sheriff taken at a checkpoint. For a number of reasons, however, Kline is not dispositive. First, in Kline, the sheriffs department at issue was assisted by five area municipal police departments in the operation of the sobriety checkpoint, see Kline, 559 Pa. at 648, 741 A.2d at 1281, thus substantially clouding the \u201cindependence\u201d issue. Moreover, since, as stated, the decision was focused on a collateral training question, the opinion provides no developed reasoning which would support the notion that sheriffs have the authority to independently establish and conduct sobriety checkpoints. Presumably, the dearth of discussion of the authority issue vis-a-vis checkpoints is on account of the framing of the litigants\u2019 contentions, as no challenge on the overarching authority question appears to have been asserted. In light of the absence of a relevant focus, we decline to read Kline as transforming traditional, common-law peacekeeping powers into authority to conduct suspicionless stops. See supra note 4.\nFurthermore, we differ with the Commonwealth\u2019s position that a power to arrest at a sobriety checkpoint and the authority to independently establish and conduct the checkpoint in the first instance are inextricably intertwined. In point of fact, if the Sheriffs lacked the latter authority pertaining to the checkpoint at which Appellee was stopped without particularized suspicion and tested for effects of alcohol intoxication, there could have been no valid ensuing arrest. Cf. Dobbins, 594 Pa. at 89, 934 A.2d at 1181 (directing suppression of all evidence discovered through an investigation by sheriffs\u2019 deputies which exceeded the bounds of their authority). Thus, the authority to independently establish and conduct the checkpoint is a threshold issue to be considered on its own terms relative to the suppression issue.\nIn terms of such independent authority, we conclude essentially where we began. Again, suspicionless stops are not made based on an in-presence breach of the peace or commission of a felony; rather, they are inherently investigatory. Cf. Commonwealth v. Dobbins, 880 A.2d 690, 696 (Pa.Super.2005) (Del Sole, P.J., dissenting) (\u201cIn this case, the sheriffs were conducting an investigation, thus looking for a breach of the peace, not witnessing one.\u201d). Since Leet, majority decisions of this Court have repeatedly confined sheriffs\u2019 non-statutory arrest powers to those for in-presence breaches of the peace or felonies. See Dobbins, 594 Pa. at 87-89, 934 A.2d at 1180-81; Kopko, 586 Pa. at 183, 892 A.2d at 774. Accordingly, the Leet rationale \u2014 which defines sheriffs\u2019 common-law arrest powers for present purposes \u2014 in no way authorizes the independent establishment and conduct of suspicionless roadside checkpoints by sheriffs or sheriffs\u2019 deputies. As amply related by the common pleas and intermediate courts, suspicionless stops represent a peculiar \u2014 and highly regulated \u2014 exercise of police powers, which are particularly broad in matters pertaining to highway safety. See Commonwealth v. Mikulan, 504 Pa. 244, 247, 470 A.2d 1339, 1840-41 (1983).\nThe members of this Court maintain great respect and express gratitude for sheriffs and their deputies in the performance of indispensable public services within their realm. We reiterate, however, that they are not police officers \u2014 nor are they invested with general police powers beyond the authority to arrest for in-presence breaches of the peace and felonies \u2014 in the absence of express legislative designation.\nWe hold that the Sheriffs did not have the authority to independently establish and conduct the suspicionless sobriety checkpoint at which Appellee was arrested.\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices BAER and TODD join the opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a concurring opinion.\nJustice McCAFFERY files a dissenting opinion.\nThis matter was reassigned to this author.\n. While the Sheriffs were assisted by other county personnel, the identity and authority of such personnel is not relevant to the issue before this Court.\n. See generally Weeks v. United. States, 232 U.S. 383, 398, 34 S.Ct. 341, 346, 58 L.Ed. 652 (1914) (implementing the exclusionary rule precluding the federal courts from admitting evidence procured in violation of an accused\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights); Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 655, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 1691, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961) (holding that, per the Fourteenth Amendment, \"all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court\u201d); Commonwealth v. Gordon, 546 Pa. 65, 71, 683 A.2d 253, 256 (1996) (explaining that the exclusionary rule also operates to enforce rights under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution).\n. In Dobbins and Kopko, this Court reviewed the truncated passages of foundational statutory authority addressing sheriffs\u2019 powers, explaining that the General Assembly has limited powers and duties of sheriffs to those \"authorized or imposed upon them by statute,\u201d 13 P.S. \u00a7 40, and that their primary duties are to \"serve process and execute orders directed ... pursuant to the law,\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2921. See, e.g., Dobbins, 594 Pa. at 84-85, 934 A.2d at 1178.\n. Courts remain wary of the sort of expansive reading of a judicial decision advocated by the Commonwealth here. See generally Schering-Plough Healthcare Prods., Inc. v. Schwarz Pharma, Inc., 586 F.3d 500, 512 (7th Cir.2009) (explaining that \"uncritical generalization is a path to error\u201d and that \"[o]ne form of uncritical generalization ... is reading general language literally\u201d); Oliver v. City of Pittsburgh, 608 Pa. 386, 394-95, 11 A.3d 960, 965-66 (2011) (discussing the phenomenon of loose language in judicial opinions, which is not to be substituted for focused analysis, particularly pertaining to matters outside the scope of an opinion). The subsequent decisions of this Court clarifying the scope of the Leet and Kline holdings are consistent with such concerns.\n. One of the more substantial omissions in Leet is the failure to consider that, for most Vehicle Code violations witnessed by an officer, the statute specifically authorizes only members of the Pennsylvania State Police to effectuate warrantless arrests of residents. See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6304(a). The general rule prevailing for other police officers is that they are specifically authorized to arrest only nonresidents for in-presence violations. See id. \u00a7 6304(b). These noted powers are \"in addition to any other powers of arrest conferred by law,\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6304(c), for example, arrests for DUI authorized per 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3811. Nevertheless, these provisions suggest at the very least that the General Assembly may have desired to cabin warrantless arrest authority for less serious infractions, in favor of the issuance of citations, as is reflected in the prevailing Pennsylvania decisional law. See Commonwealth v. Glassman, 359 Pa.Super. 230, 234, 518 A.2d 865, 867 (1986) (holding that, under 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6304(b), a police officer lacked authority to effectuate a warrantless arrest of a resident for certain Vehicle Code violations). The General Assembly\u2019s apparent restraint in this regard affords citizens a modicum of protection against a disproportionate encounter with the criminal justice system which might otherwise be allowable under the Fourth Amendment. See, e.g., Atwater v. City of Lago Vista, 532 U.S. 318, 121 S.Ct. 1536, 149 L.Ed.2d 549 (2001) (holding that a warrantless arrest for seatbelt violations and failure to carry license and insurance documents \u2014 in which a mother was arrested and handcuffed before her three-and-five-year-old children, taken into police custody, and jailed \u2014 did not violate the Fourth Amendment\u2019s restraint on unreasonable seizures). At the very least, Leet should have considered the consequences of overlaying common-law arrest powers for one category of peace officers, cabined only by an undefined breach-of-the-peace litmus to determine arrest authority, over such a more refined statutory scheme.\nLeet also intermixes a historical account of early English sheriffs as officials having essentially plenary law enforcement powers with later limitations on the function of American sheriffs, while offering little account for the derivation of these differences or developmental and historical nuances associated with the evolving role of peace officers. See, e.g., Leet, 537 Pa. at 95, 641 A.2d at 303 (summing up the Court's historical account with the comment that, \u201c[t]o make the point, how few children would question that the infamous Sheriff of Nottingham had at least the authority to arrest Robin Hood\u201d). Moreover, Leet's loose incorporation of undefined peacekeeping powers as the rational litmus for determining sheriffs' current authority under the Vehicle Code has yielded substantial uncertainties in the jurisprudence. See, e.g., Kopko, 586 Pa. at 190, 892 A.2d at 778 (\"[Ojur courts have not mapped out definitive boundaries to define the extent of the residual common law authority of Sheriffs regarding criminal investigation and arrest.\u201d). See generally Atwater, 532 U.S. at 327 n. 2, 121 S.Ct. at 1543 n. 2 (explaining that the term \"breach of the peace,\u201d in terms of the role of peacekeeping officials, is loosely defined and heavily context laden).\n. It has been suggested, in the Vehicle Code context, that all criminal violations represent breaches of the peace, and, therefore, there is no need to distinguish between sheriffs\u2019 peacekeeping powers and Code enforcement activities. See, e.g., Leet, 401 Pa.Super. 490, 513, 585 A.2d 1033, 1045 (1991) (Cirillo, J., dissenting). This sort of oversimplification, however, does not provide the necessary grounding for a reasoned judicial opinion. First, Vehicle Code enforcement entails more than just arrests for criminal violations, as exemplified by the present case concerning the establishment of checkpoints to conduct suspicionless stops. Second, there are Vehicle Code violations constituting summary offenses which do not readily comport with the conception of a breach of the peace, for example, the failure to employ a seat belt. See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4581(b); cf. Atwater, 532 U.S. at 327 n. 2, 121 S.Ct. at 1543 n. 2 (assuming, albeit without definitively deciding, that a seatbelt violation is not a per se breach of the peace).\n. We have acknowledged that Leet could have been a better developed opinion, see supra note 5; however, there is a salutary aspect in that some of the deficiencies are offsetting in relation to others.\n. Here, as in Dobbins:\nNothing in this Opinion ... should be construed to limit sheriffs' well-documented and salutary role in support of those law enforcement agencies so authorized [to conduct law enforcement investigations], nor should our ruling be read to suggest that the General Assembly lacks authority to grant broader investigatory power to sheriffs in this or other contexts. Those questions simply are not before us.\nDobbins, 594 Pa. at 89 n. 21, 934 A.2d at 1181 n. 21.\nAdditionally, our opinion here does not address the circumstances of sheriffs or deputies who may be accorded general police powers or denominated \"police officers\u201d by the General Assembly, as is the situation in counties of the second class. See generally Allegheny Cnty. Deputy Sheriffs Ass'n v. PLRB, 615 Pa. 126, 128, 135, 41 A.3d 839, 841, 845 (2012)."}
