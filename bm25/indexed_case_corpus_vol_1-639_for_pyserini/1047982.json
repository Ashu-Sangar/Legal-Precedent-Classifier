{"id": "1047982", "contents": "Mr. Justice Sharswood\ndelivered the opinion of the court, October 30th 1876.\nFrederick Snyder, the appellee, entered into a written- contract with Nicholas Wolf, the owner of a saw-mill, by which he undertook to deliver at the mill \u201c all the hemlock timber now cut down and peeled on the Wentroth tract of land, formerly Rorabaugh\u2019s, and on,the Pensacola tract,\u201d on or before a certain day, Wolf agreeing to pay him therefor the sum of two dollars and fifty cents per thousand feet. Snyder fulfilled the contract by hiring teams and drivers, but did no hauling himself. The saw-mill, fixtures and other personal property of Wolf having been levied on and sold by the sheriff under two judgments by the appellant, an auditor was appointed to distribute the proceeds. He reported that Snyder was entitled to priority to the extent of two hundred dollars, under the provisions of the Act of April 9th 1872, Pamph. L. 47. Exceptions filed by the appellant were overruled and the report confirmed by the court, and from this decree this appeal was taken.\nThe only question presented is whether Frederick Snyder was a \u201cminer, mechanic, laborer, or clerk.\u201d These and these only are the classes of persons to whose claims priority is secured by the act. \u201c Miner, mechanic or clerk,\u201d it is not pretended that he was. \u25a0 Was he a laborer ? If he was a laborer it must be conceded that it does not matter in what manner his services were to be compensated,, whether by daily wages or by the quantity of lumber delivered. The act does not say wages, but \u201c all moneys that may be due or hereafter become due for labor and services.\u201d What class of persons was intended tobe comprehended by the word \u201claborer?\u201d We think this question has been very accurately answered by this court in Daniel Seider\u2019s Appeal, 10 Wright 57. \u201c By laborers,\u201d says Mr. Justice Woodward, in delivering the opinion of the court, \u201c we mean those who perform with their own hands the contract they make with the employer.\u201d It is clear that Frederick Snyder does not fall within this description. The act meant to favor those who earned their money by the sweat of their own brows, not those who were mere contractors to have the work done, and whose compensation was the profit they would realize on the transaction. Had Snyder been a chief workman, and employed helpers or assistants, the case might have presented a different question, which it is not necessary here to determine; for it would seem that such helpers would be entitled to priority, and it is very clear that the act did not intend to give a double lien. In such case, if he had paid the assistants, he might be entitled to stand in their shoes- by substitution, and recover the balance as compensation agreed upon for his own services. A somewhat analogous question arose under the Mechanics\u2019 Lien Lavra, and it was decided by this court, in Jones v. Shawhan, 4 W. & S. 257, that one who furnishes nothing but his superintendence and skill as an' undertaker had no right to file a lien for anything in pursuance of his contract as such. . \u201c It is he,\u201d said Chief Justice Hibson, \u201c who has found the labor or material, and not-he who has ordered them, that is entitled to the lien. Were the contractor, as well as the mechanic or material-men, allowed to file, there might be double liens and possibly double recoveries, which the law does not tolerate.\u201d\nDecree reversed at the costs of the appellee, and record remitted that the proper award\" of distribution may be made in the court below in conformity with this opinion."}
