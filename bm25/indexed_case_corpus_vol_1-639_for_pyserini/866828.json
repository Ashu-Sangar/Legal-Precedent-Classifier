{"id": "866828", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe are not convinced that there was any error in dismissing the twelve exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report recited in the' specifications of error respectively. On the contrary, we think, in view of the facts and circumstances of the case, that the conelusions reached by the learned judge of the common pleas are substantially correct. We find nothing in the record that requires either a reversal or modification of the decree.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant."}
