{"id": "1084465", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nPlaintiff filed a hill in equity for specific performance by defendant of an alleged contract for the sale to him of a certain parcel of real estate in the City of Pottsville. A demurrer was sustained and this appeal followed.\nThe writing depended on to show the terms of the alleged contract and the description of the property involved is as follows:\n\u00abNov. 21,1922.\n\u00abReceived from James B. Heller, M.D.\nOne Hundred.......00/100 Dollars First payment on 317 W. Market for consideration of $20,000.\n$100 Ella G. Cochran Catherine G. Cochrane.\u201d\nThe opinion of the court below sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill correctly states: \u00abThe agreement in this case is too vague and indefinite to permit equity to enforce it......In addition to the vagueness in the description of the property, there is nothing contained in the agreement relative to the terms or time of payment or delivery of the deed; all of these matters will have to be established by parol evidence, and, indeed, as to some of them the bill alleges verbal agreements were entered into.\u201d\nThe general subject before us has been so thoroughly discussed in recent cases that it would serve no useful purpose to go over the ground again at this time: See Weisenberger v. Huebner, 264 Pa. 316; O\u2019Connell v. Cease, 267 Pa. 288; Manufacturers\u2019 L. & H. Co. v. Lamp, 269 Pa. 517, 520; Shaw v. Cornman, 271 Pa. 260.\nThe decree is affirmed at cost of appellant."}
