{"id": "1927823", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nIn 1968 appellant was indicted for murder, voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. Appellant waived his right to a trial by jury, the murder indictment was nolle prossed, and he was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Post-trial motions were filed and denied and appellant was sentenced to ten years probation. This appeal followed. We affirm.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s theory of criminal responsibility is that appellant aided and abetted William \u201cJune\u201d Smith in the killing of Anthony Rhodes, and therefore may be punished as if he were the principal offender. See Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, \u00a71105, as amended, 18 P.S. \u00a75105. Appellant\u2019s sole contention is that on the state of the facts of the instant case, he did not \u201caid and abet\u201d Smith in the homicide.\nAt trial the Commonwealth\u2019s- evidence consisted of a statement given to police by appellant and the testimony of Nathaniel Matt, who was with Rhodes when the fatal shooting occurred; appellant testified in his own behalf. Prom this evidence the following facts appeared : On January 14, 1968, appellant and two friends, John Mizelle and William \u201cJune\u201d Smith, were on their way to a dance when they decided to stop at a candy store for some food. As the trio was about to enter, they saw two members of the 32nd and Berks Street gang inside. The trio waited outside until the two members, Anthony Rhodes and Nathaniel Matt, came out of the store. Appellant then shouted \u201c32nd and Berks,\u201d which statement, according to appellant, was an invitation to a \u201cfair one,\u201d i.e., a fight. According to Matt, approximately four seconds after appellant\u2019s shout, Smith pulled out a revolver and began shooting. Rhodes attempted to knock the gun out of Smith\u2019s hand with an umbrella. He was not successful and was shot to death. The participants then fled. Matt testified that appellant did not say or do anything after his initial shout. Appellant testified that although he knew Smith owned a gun, he did not know that Smith had the gun with him.\nIt is, of course, settled law that \u201cmere presence\u201d at a homicide does not constitute aiding and abetting. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Giovanetti, 341 Pa. 345, 353, 19 A. 2d 119, 123 (1941); 1 Wharton, Criminal Law and Procedure \u00a7114, at 248 (Anderson 1957). On the other hand, \u201c[g]uilt or innocence of the abettor ... is not determined by the quantum of his advice or encouragement. If it is rendered to induce another to commit the crime and actually has this effect, no more is required.\u201d Perkins, Parties to Crime, 89 U. Pa. L. Rev. 581, 598 (1941) (citations omitted).\nIn the instant case the trier of fact could very well conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant\u2019s shout of \u201c32nd and Berks\u201d, in light of the surrounding circumstances, was rendered to induce Smith to commit the crime. Appellant may not, therefore, on the state of these facts, maintain that he was merely a spectator and not a participant in this crime.\nThe judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas, Trial Division, Criminal Section, of Philadelphia County is affirmed.\nThe Commonwealth does not urge that appellant and Smith were coeonspirators. Cf. Commonwealth v. Garrett, 423 Pa. 8, 222 A. 2d 902 (1960).\nThe statement was admitted into evidence on stipulation by defense counsel that appellant was warned of his rights under Esoobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S. Ct. 1758 (1964), and Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966)."}
