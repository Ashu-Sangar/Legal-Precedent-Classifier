{"id": "1221695", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThe appeal involves the construction of an inter vivos deed of trust. The principal question is whether the interest of a deceased great granddaughter was vested or contingent. Another question presented is whether heirs of settlor are to be determined as of the date of his death or that of the life tenant. The court below, one judge dissenting, decided that the interest was contingent and settlor\u2019s heirs were to he determined as of the date of the death of the life tenant. This appeal followed.\nJohn D. Thompson, settlor, executed an inter vivos deed of trust dated December 3, 1908. He died December 16,1911. By the terms of the deed settlor transferred to the named trustee 300 shares of stock of a trust company. The trustee was directed to: . . collect the dividends declared and paid thereon and pay the same as they shall be collected unto my granddaughter, Bessie Emma Tayman Ginther, of said City of Pittsburgh, for and during the term of her natural life, and from and after the death of my said granddaughter, to pay said dividends, as they shall be received, unto her children, and as each child reaches the age of twenty-one years to transfer to such child a pro rata number of shares of said stock, and in default of any such child reaching twenty-one years, to transfer said stock to my own heirs; . .\nThe granddaughter received the dividends until her death on January 26, 1948. Her only child, Louise Eleanor Ginther, predeceased her, having attained the age of 21 years and 26 days. The great granddaughter\u2019s sole heir (under the law of her then domicil) was her father, George Ginther, who subsequently died leaving as his sole heir (under the law of his then domicil) his wife, Bessie Emma Tayman Ginther (the life tenant), who thereafter died testate, and whose executor is the appellant herein. Settlor at his death left surviving as his heirs and next of kin a son, a granddaughter, daughter of a deceased daughter (the life tenant herein), and two granddaughters, daughters of a deceased son.\nWhether the interest of the great granddaughter was vested or contingent depends upon whether the language of the deed is construed to convey an absolute remainder to her but merely postpones its enjoyment until tlie great granddaughter had attained 21 years (in which event it is vested) or whether the grant is intended to be effective only in the event that the great granddaughter survived her mother and attained 21 years (in which event it is contingent).\nAn examination of the language discloses that there are no express words of gift independent of the direction and time for transfer. The gift is necessarily implied solely from the direction to transfer. As the implied gift is inseparable from the direction to transfer, it necessarily partakes of the quality of the direction. This renders the grant to the great granddaughter contingent. Chief Justice Gibson said in Moore v. Smith, 9 Watts 403, at p. 407: \u201c. . . where there is no separate and antecedent gift which is independent of the direction and time for payment, the legacy is contingent; and it seems to he as well founded in reason, as rules of interpretation usually are. Where a gift is only implied from a direction to pay, it is necessarily inseparable from the direction, and must partake of its quality; insomuch that if the one is future and contingent, so must the other be.\u201d\nIn Rickenbach Estate, 348 Pa. 121, p. 125 et seq., 34 A. 2d 527, we discussed this canon of construction and cited the principal cases which have applied the doctrine. The learned auditing judge correctly ruled that the interest was contingent.\nThe deed provided that upon default of great grandchildren surviving the life tenant and attaining 21 years, the trustee was \u201cto transfer said stock to settlor\u2019s own heirs.\u201d The learned court below decided that the heirs were to be determined as of the date of the death of the life tenant, relying upon Laughlin\u2019s Estate, 336 Pa. 529, 9 A. 2d 383, and Barnard Estate, 351 Pa. 313, 41 A. 2d 578.\nThe date of this deed was prior to the effective dates of the Acts of June 29, 1923, P. L. 914, 21 PS, 11 and April 24, 1947, P. L. 100, 20 PS, 301.14. The gift to heirs or next of kin therefore refers to those who were such at the time of settlor\u2019s death unless a different intent is plainly manifest. And if the tenant for life is of next of kin, he is not thereby excluded: Buzby\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa. 111; Stewart\u2019s Estate, 147 Pa. 383, 23 A. 599; Peirce et al. v.

Superior Ct. 332, 191 A. 184.\nAll that this settlor wrote in the deed was that after the death of the life tenant, and upon default as therein stated, the transfer was to be made \u201cto [his] heirs.\u201d Solely from this language the learned auditing judge inferred that settlor intended the heirs to be determined as of that date. But this inference is not justified. In both Baughlin\u2019s Estate and Barnard Estate, supra, plain and unequivocal language was employed which manifested a clear intent that heirs were to be determined as of the date of death of the life tenant. In the Baughlin ease it plainly appeared, from a reading of the entire will, that testator\u2019s use of the term C(surviving children\u201d meant children who survived the life tenant and not the testator. In the Barnard case the language disclosed an intent to determine the heirs as of the death of the life tenant. We said, in that case, p. 316:\n\u201cThe words of this will clearly indicate that the true intent of testator was to determine the heirs as of the time of distribution. This is not a case of the gift of a life estate with remainder to heirs, of which the life tenant was one. This testator worked out a scheme of distribution whereby his wife took a life estate in the whole trust. At her death one-half (or so much thereof as was appointed) passed according to her will. The rest went to testator\u2019s heirs. The heirs, under these circumstances, are to be determined as of the date of the death of the life tenant, whose estate is thereby excluded, (citing cases)\n\u201cAny possible doubt is dispelled when it is considered that testator interpreted his own will. He wrote: \u2018My purpose being that my wife, although having bub a life interest in the whole of the said trust . . .\u2019 (italics supplied). If we were to adopt appellant\u2019s construction, testator\u2019s widow would possess an intestate share in remainder in addition to her life estate, which would be in contradiction of testator\u2019s express words.\u201d\nIn the present case the sole fact that settlor transferred the remainder to his own heirs following the death of the life tenant is not a sufficient indication of intent to rebut the presumption. There must be more than that, otherwise all grants and devises to heirs after the death of the life tenant would be to heirs determined as of that date. This would make the canon of construction and above cited cases meaningless.\nThe decree of distribution is modified. It is directed that distribution be made to the heirs at law and next of kin of settlor determined as of December 16,1911, the date of settlor\u2019s death.\nThe decree, as modified, is affirmed. Costs to be paid put of the corpus of the fund."}
