{"id": "467399", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Patterson,\nThese appeals involve a controversy between life tenants and remainderman over the allocation of stock dividends and proceeds of the sale of stock subscription rights received by the trustee of an inter vivos trust.\nBy deed of trust dated June 19, 1905, Nathaniel Ferguson, the'settlor (who died August 27,1930), transferred to The Beal Estate Title Insurance and Trust Company of Philadelphia (now Land Title Bank & Trust Company) 500 shares of the capital stock of the Consumers Gas Company of Beading, Pennsylvania, in trust, to collect \u201call such dividends, accretions, profits or benefits of every kind whatsoever as may be declared, become due and be payable upon or on account of said shares\u201d and to \u201cexpend such dividends in the purchase of suitable gifts and to distribute the same in each and every year\u201d to himself, his three children (Margaret Bodman Ferguson, Grace Ferguson, and Richmond Jones Ferguson) and to his mother-in-law and father-in-law (Margaret E. McC. Jones and Richmond L. Jones), during their respective lives and the life of the survivor, on their several birthday anniversaries and on specified holidays. The 500 shares of stock so transferred had been received by settlor in kind on distribution under the intestate laws of his deceased wife\u2019s separate estate. His object, as recited in the preamble, was \u201cto continue, during the lives of all of her family, her happy way and pleasing custom of distributing gifts among us out of her separate estate, upon the recurrence of the festivals, days and times hereinafter mentioned, that on those days she shall be ever present with us as she used to be.\u201d On the death of the last survivor it is provided that the 500 shares of Consumers Gas Company stock, or whatever may have been substituted therefor, \u201ctogether with all accretions, additions and accumulations thereto and thereon,\u201d shall be transferred to the Rector, Church Wardens and Vestrymen of Christ Church, Reading, Pennsylvania, as a perpetual trust to be known as \u201cThe Robin Jones Ferguson Fund,\u201d the income to be applied \u201cin the purchase of suitable gifts, which are to be distributed, as by her hand, on Christmas Days and Easter Days to gladden the hearts of little orphans or friendless children of the City of Reading.\u201d\nIn Item 3 settlor provided as follows: \u201cIf there should be at any time, or from time to time, any accretion or accretions by way of extra dividends, increase of capital stock inuring to the benefit of stockholders, or otherwise, the same shall be added to and form part of the principal fund and held by the Trustee.\u201d Relying on this provision the trustee has added to and treated as principal five stock dividends received by it in the period from December, 1923, to September, 1932, totaling 525 shares, which the trustee retains, plus certain fractional shares sold for $55.47. The trustee has also added to and treated as principal the sum of $7763.71 received as proceeds from the sale of 1282 stock subscription rights issued to it in June, 1929, and May, 1931. At the inception of the trust and during the first four years, until 1909, the trustee received regular semi-annual dividends of $375, or $750.00 per year. After 1909 the trustee received quarterly dividends increasing in amount to $765.63 each in 1933, or $3062.52 per year. All such dividends have been distributed to the life beneficiaries and in addition they have received fifth cash dividends paid to the trustee in the years 1915,1924, and 1925.\nAt the audit of the trustee\u2019s first account filed November 22, 1944, the surviving life beneficiaries (Margaret Ferguson Hansen, Grace Ferguson Adams, and Richmond Jones Ferguson) objected to the trustee\u2019s retention of the stock dividends and the proceeds of stock subscription rights as additions to principal, contending that there should be apportionment between life tenants and remainderman. The auditing judge rejected this contention on the ground that the deed of trust, in Item 3, expresses a contrary intention, and entered a decree confirming the account. Exceptions to the adjudication were dismissed and these appeals were then taken.\nThe question is whether Item 3 expresses an intent contrary to the rule of apportionment. The life tenants argue that it does not\u2014that the words \u201cany accretion or accretions\u201d must be construed as comprehending merely \u201cany increases of corpus,\u201d because (1) this is the ordinary meaning of the term \u201caccretion\u201d when used in connection with shares of stock; (2) unless such construction is adopted a repugnancy exists between Item 3 and Item 1 which under familiar rules of construction must be resolved in their favor; and (3) the parties have approved such construction in that increased cash dividends and cash dividends in addition to the regular quarterly dividends have been paid to the life beneficiaries, including settlor, without objection. We conclude, as did the Orphans\u2019 Court, that an intent against apportionment is expressed by settlor, which intention will be given effect except as some positive rule of law may prevent: Opperman\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 319 Pa. 455, 459, 179 A. 729.\nThe term \u201caccretion\u201d, used in relation to shares of stock, has acquired no clearly defined meaning in our law as comprehending either income or principal, or both. Its meaning as so used is a question that may be resolved differently under varying circumstances and factual situations. See Doty v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 148 F. 2d 503, 507. In speaking of capital gain, a number of our cases have used the term as synonymous with the word \u201cincrease,\u201d as for example \u201caccretion to the corpus\u201d (Graham\u2019s Estate, 198 Pa. 216, 219, 47 A. 1108) \u201cprincipal accretions\u201d (Chauncey\u2019s Estate, 303 Pa. 441, 446, 154 A. 814) or \u201caccretion of the principal\u201d (Nirdlinger\u2019s Estate, 290 Pa. 457, 475, 139 A. 200). But the only case found where construction of the term itself as applied to stock was specifically in issue clearly indicates that it may, in a proper case, be construed to include income: Revloc Supply Co. v. Troxell, 281 Pa. 424, 126 A. 774.\nWhat is the proper construction of the term as used by settlor in Item 3? Had he simply provided that \u201cany accretion or accretions\u201d should be added to principal, a more difficult question would be presented. But this is not what settlor did. He did not use the term \u201caccretion\u201d generally. He provided there should be added to principal any accretion or accretions \u201cby way of extra dividends, increase of capital stock inuring to the benefit of stockholders, or otherwise.\u201d These words of modification were obviously inserted by the settlor for the purpose of defining the class of receipts by the trustee intended to be embraced by \u201caccretion or accretions,\u201d limiting the class to the items enumerated and receipts of a similar nature. So defined, the term embraces the stock dividends and subscription rights in question. To hold otherwise would be to discard the carefully worded language of Item 3 as meaningless surplusage. This we may not and will not do: Horn Estate, 351 Pa. 131, 136, 40 A. 2d 471; Hannach\u2019s Estate, 332 Pa. 145, 149, 2 A. 2d 711.\nItem 1 does not give the life tenants \u201call dividends of every kind whatsoever\u201d as appellants state. Settlor empowers the trustee to collect and hold \u201call such dividends, accretions, profits, or benefits of every kind whatsoever as may ~be declared, become due and be payable.\u201d He then provides that the trustee shall \u201cpay, lay out and expend such dividends in the purchase of suitable gifts\u201d etc. It is only \u201csuch dividends,\u201d to wit, \u201csuch dividends as may be declared\u201d that are given to the life tenants by the direction to expend. Each of the other items mentioned in the direction to collect and hold, i. e., \u201caccretions,\u201d \u201cprofits\u201d and \u201cbenefits of every kind whatsoever,\u201d is carefully excluded. So construing Item 1 there is no repugnancy between Item 1 and Item 3 to be resolved in appellants\u2019 favor. On tbe contrary, it is clearly evident from a comparison of the two items that settlor recognized a difference between ordinary dividends, which are indisputably income, given to the life tenants by Item 1, and \u201caccretions\u201d such as \u201cextra dividends, increase of capital stock inuring to the benefit of stockholders\u201d and receipts of a similar nature, which may be doubtful receipts with respect to their classification as principal or income: Chauncey\u2019s Estate, supra, 447. Nor is there merit in the contention that receipt by the life beneficiaries of a fifth cash dividend in the years 1915, 1924 and 1925 involves a course of conduct consistent with their present position. Mere irregularity affords no basis for classifying cash dividends as extra or extraordinary. \u201cThere have been exceedingly few cases where a cash dividend has been classified as extraordinary, and in no case has this been done in the absence of unusual circumstances . . . Ordinarily cash dividends have not been treated as extraordinary, except where used to exercise subscription rights, and thus, in reality, stock dividends, or where declared from capital, however produced, or where of an unusual nature\u201d: Nirdlinger\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 327 Pa. 160, 168, 169, 193 A. 33.\nAdditional briefs have been filed on the question whether receipt by the life tenants of income on accumulated income violates the Act of April 18, 1853, P. L. 503. While the ruling of the court below on this point has not been assigned as error, and the matter is not properly before us, we have considered it and conclude that no such violation is involved. The Act expressly excludes accumulations for charity from its operation. And the fact that non-eharitable beneficiaries participate in the income on the accumulations until the time of distribution is immaterial: Lennig\u2019s Estate, 154 Pa. 209, 25 A. 1049; Gray, The Rule Against Perpetuities, 4th ed.\nDecree affirmed. Costs to be paid by appellants.\nBy stipulation of counsel it is established that of tbe 525 shares received by way of stock dividends, 473 were declared and paid out of earnings and that all of the stock subscription rights were so paid."}
