{"id": "850180", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThere was no error in refusing plaintiff\u2019s first to fourth points, inclusive, nor in affirming defendant\u2019s second point for charge; and hence the second to sixth specifications of error are not sustained.\nThe only remaining specification is the first, which charges error in entering judgment non obstante veredicto against plaintiff and in favor of the defendant on the special verdict. The correctness of that judgment is sufficiently vindicated in the opinion of the learned president of the court below. All that is necessary to be said on the questions involved will be found therein. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that plaintiff had a cause of action, it was barred by the statute of limitations. The right of action, to whomsoever if accrued, was complete not later than the time when the work commenced had progressed to such an extent as to obstruct ingress and egress to and from the property to the streets; and the jury expressly found \u201c that the work was begun, so as to obstruct the streets, more than six years prior to the bringing of this suit.\u201d The statute was therefore a flat bar.\nWe find no error in the record that should interfere with the affirmance of the judgment.\nJudgment affirmed."}
