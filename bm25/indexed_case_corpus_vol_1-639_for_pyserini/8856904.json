{"id": "8856904", "contents": "The opinion of the-court was filed October 6th, 1884.'\nPer Curiam.\nThis petition was properly quashed. Conceding that the indorsement on some of the tickets was in such form as to make them illegal ballots, yet the petition does not aver that they were cast for the respondent, nor counted as votes in his favor. It does not state the whole number of votes cast in tbe ward, nor tbe number improperly endorsed.\nWaiving the question of the legality of the endorsement, we think the insufficiency of the petition justified the decision of the court.\nJudgment affirmed."}
