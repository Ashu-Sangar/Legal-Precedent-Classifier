{"id": "1898575", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nSarah Thornton (testatrix), by will, devised: (1) property located at 416 Marne Avenue, Monongahela, known as Lot 1, to her daughter, Eugenia T. Dumas; (2) property located at 508 .Marne Avenue, Monongahela, known as Lot 2, to her son, Junius Thornton'; (3) property located at 90 Third Avenue, Monongahela, known' as Lot 3, to her grandson, Norman Thornton, for life and, upon his death, the remainder to his two children, Gertrude and Michael Thornton.\nTestatrix\u2019 personal estate was insufficient to pay her debts and administration' expenses and it became necessary to sell testatrix\u2019 three pieces of realty; such realty was sold with court permission. After the payment of testatrix\u2019 debts and administration expenses and at the audit of the estate, the question was raised whether, under \u00a7751(2) of the Fiduciaries Act of 1949, the gift to testatrix\u2019 grandson, Norman Thornton, and his children should be abated in favor of the gifts to' testatrix\u2019 children, Eugenia Dumas and Junius Thornton.\nThe Orphans\u2019 .Court of Washington Co.unty. decreed that the amount necessary for. the payment of testatrix\u2019 debts and administration expenses should be' pro rated between the three devisees in proportion to the ratio of the prices received for each property separately at the sales to the total amount received from all sales. From that decree Mrs. Dumas has appealed.\nThe gravamen of the controversy lies in the mean ing of the word \u201cissue\u201d under \u00a7751, supra. Section 751 provides, inter alia:\n\u201cOrder of abatement\n\u201c(a) General rules. Except as otherwise provided by the will, if the assets are insufficient to pay-all-claimants and distributees in full, the shares of distributees, without distinction between real and personal estate, shall have priority of distribution in the following order: (1) Property specifically devised or bequeathed to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse ; ('2) Property specifically devised or'bequeathed to or for the benefit of the decedent\u2019s issue; (3) Property specifically devised or bequeathed to or for the benefit of other distributees; . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied).\nSince testatrix died without a surviving spouse, was the property devised to testatrix\u2019 grandson and great-grandchildren \u201cproperty specifically devised -. . . to or for the benefit of decedent\u2019s issue\u201d under \u00a7751 (a) (2) ? Mrs. Dumas contends the grandson and great-grandchildren are not \u201cissue\u201d within the statute and, therefore, the specific devise to them should abate in favor of testatrix\u2019 children, Mrs. Dumas and Junius Thornton.\nAt the outset, two things must be noted: (a) the three devises in testatrix\u2019 will were - \u201cspecifically devised\u201d within the \u00bfleaning of \u00a7751 (a)'(2) -; nowhere in this will do we find evid\u00e9nce as did the court below&wkey; of either anexpr\u00e9ss of implied intent bn the pdrt of the testatrix as to an abatement preference, hence the phrase \u201cExcept as otherwise provided by the will\u201d in \u00a7751 (a) is presently inapposite.\nMrs. Dumas submits that a pro rata abatement among the three devisees is not required because, under \u00a7751 (a) (2), testatrix\u2019 grandchild and great-grandchildren are not her \u201cissue\u201d, which, in the context of Mrs. Dumas\u2019 submission, means offspring next in line to take from testatrix and not progeny in a line of inheritance. The logical sequence of such submission is that the grandchild and great-grandchildren would be classed as \u201cother distributees\u201d \u2014 the least favored class \u2014 under \u00a7751(a)(3).\nThe statutory use of \u201cissue\u201d under \u00a7751 (a) (2) has never been determined by this or any other court in the Commonwealth.\nIn the inner structure of \u00a7751 (a) we find our first aid in interpretation. The most favored type of devise or bequest \u2014 the specific devise or bequest \u2014 is divided, in order of priority, into gifts (1) to \u201csurviving spouse\u201d, (2) to \u201cdecedent\u2019s issue\u201d and (3) to \u201cother distributees.\u201d Agreement with Mrs. Dumas\u2019 contention would lead to the conclusion that \u201cissue\u201d, other than \u201cissue\u201d next in line from testatrix, would be classified as \u201cother distributees\u201d and we would reach the anomalous result that the order of abatement in the case at bar would be: (1) specific devises to spouse\u2014 here, none; (2) specific devises to those offspring next in line to take from testatrix \u2014 here, testatrix\u2019 son and daughter; (3) specific devises to \u201cother distributees\u201d, here, testatrix\u2019 grandson and great-grandchildren who would then occupy a status no higher than that of complete strangers to the blood.\nCommon sense would seem to dictate that a more equitable and logical categorization would be reached by defining \u201cissue\u201d in such manner that testatrix\u2019 offspring in different generations who receive specific devises would be favored more than non-related \u201cdistributees.\u201d Grandchildren and great-grandchildren should for this purpose be treated similarly to children and not like complete strangers to the blood. Such result can only be realized by interpreting \u201cissue\u201d in broader terms than Mrs. Dumas suggests, i.e., as offspring related in a line of inheritance. Cf. Howlett Estate, 366 Pa. 293, 297, 77 A. 2d 390, 393. \u201cIssue\u201d would then attain the status of a favored class rather than a description of a few favored individuals.\nBoth the court below and Mrs. Dumas have insisted that the Pennsylvania Statutory Construction Act of 1937 (May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, \u00a7101(56), as amended, 46 P.S. \u00a7601(56)) lacks any-relevancy to the instant controversy because, even though that statute defines \u201cissue\u201d when used in a Pennsylvania statute as \u201c. . . all lawful, lineal descendants of a common ancestor\u201d, it only applies by its very terms to the descent -of' estates, i.e., cases of intestacy. We agree that the Statutory Construction Act is not directly apposite to the case at bar, but we believe that it is the most relevant analogy that exists. For Statutory Construction Act purposes, \u201cissue\u201d under intestacy laws constitutes a legislative mandate designating a favored class to receive decedent\u2019s estate. For order of abatement purposes in the Fiduciaries Act, \u201cissue\u201d constitutes a legislative mandate determining a favored class to keep that part of decedent\u2019s estate which has already been specifically devised or bequeathed. The use of \u201cissue\u201d in both statutes, in the context of distribution of estafea, lias as its purpose the protection of certain classes of relatives; in that respect a similarity of purpose is extant.\nMrs. Dumas rejects this conclusion by pointing out that prior case law which defines \u201cissue\u201d as progeny next in line to take from testator should be the preferred interpretation for \u201cissue\u201d under the Fiduciaries Act. See, e.g., Collins Estate, 393 Pa. 195, 209, 142 A. 2d 178, 186; Butler Estate, 364 Pa. 279, 283, 72 A. 2d 110, 112; Lippincott Estate, 349 Pa. 538, 545, 37 A. 2d 599, 603; Mayhew\u2019s Estate, 307 Pa. 84, 91, 92, 160 A. 724, 726, 727. However, this line of cases defines \u201cissue\u201d in the context of what the testator was presumed to have intended by his choice of that word, sometimes buttressed by other language in the particular will under consideration. On the other hand, the Statutory Construction Act\u2019s definition of \u201cissue\u201d is not based on a legislative presumption of what decedent might have intended if he had written a will but rather on a state policy of what class of people should be favored if decedent has made no such provision. Similarly, the statutory order of abatement is not based on testator\u2019s presumed priority of abatement but rather on a state policy of what class of people should keep their specific devises and bequests at the expense of other specific devisees and legatees who must first pay for the estate\u2019s deficiencies.\nOur definition of \u201cissue\u201d in \u00a7751 (a) of the Fiduciaries Act, in conformity with subsection (56) of the Statutory Construction Act (46 P.S. \u00a7601(56)), renders the Pennsylvania order of abatement similar in result to that provided in \u00a7752 of the California Probate Code. If there were nothing but specific devises or bequests, as in the case at bar, California would have a priority of abatement similar to Pennsylvania (i.e., (1) spouse, (2) issue, (3) other distributees), which would read (1) spouse (2) kindred (3) non-relatives: Estate of Buck, 32 Cal. 2d 372, 196 P. 2d 769 (1948); Estate of Stevens, 27 Cal. 2d 108, 162 P. 2d 918 (1945). The only difference between the two statutes is that the California classification of \u201ckindred\u201d includes the Pennsylvania \u201cissue\u201d of testator plus all other relatives, creating the logical, easily recognized division between relatives and the least favored group of strangers to the blood. \u201cIt is clear that, as the section now reads, a spouse or kindred are given priority over strangers for the protection of legacies whenever there is a deficiency of assets, whether to pay debts or to satisfy legacies, unless a different intention is expressed in the will.\u201d Estate of Buck, 196 P. 2d 769, 772.\nIf Mrs. Dumas\u2019 contention be accepted in the instant case, there would only be the two extremely narrow groups of (1) spouse and (2) those offspring next in line to take from testator (\u201cissue\u201d) with the rest of the specific devisees and legatees heaped into one undifferentiated class of \u201cother distributees\u201d. We believe that the Pennsylvania legislature had a different, more symmetrical classification in mind \u2014 similar to that in California, supra \u2014 by employing \u201cissue\u201d as a broad class of \u201call lawful, lineal descendants of a common ancestor.\u201d (46 P.S. \u00a7601(56)).\nDecree affirmed. Costs on the appellant.\nThe son of Junius Thornton.\nGreat-grandchildren of testatrix.\nAct of April 18, 1949, P. L. 512, \u00a7751, 20 P.S, \u00a7320.751.\nEmphasis supplied.\nSince testatrix\u2019 grandchild has a living father, if we accept Mrs. Dumas\u2019 definition of \u201cissue\u201d, neither such grandchild nor his children would be offspring next in line to take from testatrix.\nThat \u201cissue\u201d are more favored than relatives of the testatrix other than lineal offspring is, of course,.-a legislative determination which is not questioned by any theory before this Court.\nThe entire' subsection (56) reads: \u201c \u2018Issue\u2019, as applied to the descent of estates, means all lawful, lineal descendants of a common ancestor.\u201d'' Since descent of estates only occurs in cases' of intestacy, it follows that \u201cissue\u201d is defined in .the context of intestacy rights.\nThe entire Section 752 of the California Probate Code is as follows: \u201cUnless a different intention is expressed in the will, abatement takes place in any class only as between legacies of that class, and legacies to a spouse or to kindred shall abate only after abatement of legacies to persons not related to the testator.\u201d"}
