{"id": "866834", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis case depended on questions of fact, \u2014 arising out of the testimony, \u2014 which were for the exclusive determination of the jury. They were fairly submitted to them with instructions which were fully adequate and at the same time free from substantial error.\nThe only subject of complaint is the refusal of the learned judge to withdraw the case from the jury by binding instructions to find for the defendant. To have done that would have been manifest error.\nJudgment affirmed."}
