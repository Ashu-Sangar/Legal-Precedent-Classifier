{"id": "11251019", "contents": "OPINION,\nMr. Chief Justice Paxson :\nThe plaintiff was thrown out of court on the merest technicality. It claims to have been incorporated in June, 1884, under the laws of the state of Illinois, and has been doing business since that time in the city of Chicago. On May 7, 1887, it procured a policy of insurance from the defendant company on its property, for the term of one year. This policy was issued to the \u201c Union Type Foundry,\u201d that being the plaintiff\u2019s corporate name. The premium money was paid by a check drawn in the name of the \u201c Union Type Foundry,\u201d payable to the Kittanning Insurance Company. A fire occurred in January, 1888, by which the property insured was destroyed. In all the correspondence and intercourse between the plaintiff and the insurance company, in consequence of the fire, the plaintiff was known only as the \u201c Union Type Foundry.\u201d The defendant failing to make good the loss, a suit was finally commenced against it in the name of the \u201c Union Type Foundry.\u201d To this suit the defendant put in an affidavit, alleging as the only ground of defence that it had not been furnished with such proofs of loss as the terms of the policy required. Defendant pleaded non-assumpsit, payment, payment with leave, and the facts contained in the affidavit of defence. While the pleadings were in this condition, the case was arbitrated, with an award in favor of plaintiff. The defendant appealed, the case was twice upon the trial list, and twice continued. Finally it came to trial; and, after a jury had been called into the box, the defendant for the first time raised the question of the plaintiff\u2019s right to sue by filing a plea in abatement. The plea was not even sworn to as required by rule 40, \u00a7 13, of the court below. We are of opinion that it came too late: Murphy v. Chase, 103 Pa. 260. After recognizing plaintiff\u2019s character during all these transactions, and by its own pleadings filed, it came with an exceeding ill grace to spring such a plea upon the trial, when the inability of the plaintiff to make the formal proof of its charter, on the instant, might be fairly presumed, and was probably understood by the company. We think it will take no risk in drawing its check for the amount of the loss to the order of the \u201c Union Tjqie Foundry,\u201d to which it issued its policy.\nThe first, second, and seventh assignments of error are sustained. The remaining assignments are not important in our view of the case.\nThe judgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded."}
