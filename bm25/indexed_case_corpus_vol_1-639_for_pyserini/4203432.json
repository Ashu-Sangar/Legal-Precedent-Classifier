{"id": "4203432", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 28th day of April, 2011, the Court being evenly divided, the Order of the Superior Court is AFFIRMED.\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices SAYLOR and EAKIN would affirm, and Justice SAYLOR files an Opinion in Support of Affirmance.\nJustices BAER, TODD, and McCAFFERY would reverse.\nJustice SAYLOR, in support of affirmance.\nI would disapprove the utilization by an insurer of separate policies pertaining to multiple vehicles within the same household solely to subvert intra-policy stacking without any risk-based justification. Nevertheless, I am persuaded by the reasoning of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, the rationale of the Superior Court, and the suggestion by a plurality of this Court that the writing of separate policies, and enforcement of the household exclusion, is justified relative to motorcycle insurance coverage.
