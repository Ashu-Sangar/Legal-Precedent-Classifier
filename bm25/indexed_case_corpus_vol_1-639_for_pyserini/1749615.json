{"id": "1749615", "contents": "OPINION\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nAppellant, Charles W. Slaughter, was tried before a judge and jury and convicted of murder in the first degree on\nMarch 31, 1975. Penalty was fixed by the jury at life imprisonment. Post-verdict motions were filed and an appeal followed to this Court. On April 28, 1978, an opinion affirming the judgment of sentence was filed, in which a majority of the court concluded that the issues raised had been waived. Commonwealth v. Slaughter, (J-195 of 1977, filed April 28,1978). Following that decision, appellant filed a petition for reargument and/or reconsideration. The petition pointed out that a written brief which was not part of the record before us on appeal had been filed with the trial court. Based on our recent decisions in Commonwealth v. Grace, 473 Pa. 542, 375 A.2d 721 (1977); and Commonwealth v. Perillo, 474 Pa. 63, 376 A.2d 635 (1977), we ordered the case to be reargued.\nThe case was reargued on October 16, 1978. On reargument, appellant raises several issues in support of his contention that a new trial should be granted. We will address these issues in the following order:\n(1) whether it was a violation of appellant\u2019s right to confrontation and inadmissible hearsay to permit the testimony of a certain police officer regarding an eyewitness identification of appellant;\n(2) whether a statement allegedly made by appellant to police and admitted into evidence at his trial, should have been suppressed because obtained in violation of Pa.R. Cr.P. 130;\n(3) whether an in-court identification of appellant was improperly tainted by an illegal pre-trial identification procedure;\n(4) whether the trial court erroneously limited defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of a certain prosecution witness; and\n(5) whether the trial court erred in refusing to allow defense counsel to cross-examine a key prosecution witness regarding the witness\u2019s prior juvenile record.\nAppellant argues that he was denied his constitutional right to confrontation, that the hearsay rule was violated, when, over defense objection, the prosecution was permitted to question two police officers regarding identifications allegedly made of appellant by two eyewitnesses to the shooting for which he was on trial. The murder was witnessed by two individuals, Emanuel Crawford and Anthony Ragland. Only Ragland appeared in court and testified. Only Rag-land\u2019s testimony was presented by the prosecution because it had been unable to locate Crawford in order to bring him to the trial.\nAs part of its case in chief, the prosecution called a police officer who had observed appellant at the time of appellant\u2019s arrival at the Police Administration Building following his arrest, and at the subsequent interrogation. The officer testified as to appellant\u2019s physical and mental condition at the time of his arrest and that he gave appellant so-called Miranda warnings. This officer was not asked, and did not testify on direct examination, regarding any out-of-court identifications of appellant.\nDespite the fact that the officer had not been asked and had not testified on direct examination regarding any out-of-court identifications of appellant, on cross-examination, defense counsel elicited the following:\n\u201cQ. The person you had stated to the jury Lieutenant on your direct testimony is that \u2014 that you told Charles Slaughter that he had been identified as the, as you have said, the doer in this instance; is that correct?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did you tell Mr. Slaughter who it was that had identified him as being the doer?\nA. I told him he. was identified by three people as having been the doer.\nQ. Well not at that time he had been identified by two people.\nA. Yes sir.\nQ. You are sure of that?\nA. Yes sir.\nQ. You are sure it was not just one?\nA. No sir.\nQ. Were you personally present when anyone identified Charles Slaughter as the doer?\nA. No. This information was relayed to me.\nQ. Was the first person Emanuel Crawford?\nA. I believe it was Emanuel Crawford, yes, sir.\nQ. Is he here today?\nA. No, I don\u2019t believe he is.\nQ. Was he here yesterday?\nA. I don\u2019t believe he was.\nQ. Have you seen him here any day?\nA. Not to my knowledge.\nQ. Yet he was the first one that identified Charles Slaughter as being the doer in this case; is that correct?\nA. That is correct.\u201d (N.T. p. 152-153.)\nCounsel\u2019s apparent purpose for this line of questioning was to develop the theory that the two witnesses mentioned had given conflicting descriptions of the assailant. Because only one of these witnesses testified at trial, and identified appellant, counsel sought to argue to the jury that the other would not have identified appellant. In this vein, counsel questioned the officers extensively as to what, if any efforts, had been made by police to locate the missing witness. (The obvious inference counsel sought to convey to the jury was that the missing witness was not in court because his testimony would have contradicted the prosecution\u2019s key identification witness, and that, therefore, the police had made little or no effort to locate him).\nOn re-direct the prosecution was permitted, over defense objection, to ask the officer the following question:\n\u201cLieutenant at the time that you saw the defendant two-ten in the morning, how many people had identified the defendant?\u201d\nTo this, the officer replied,\n\u201cTwo, Manuel Crawford and Anthony Ragland.\u201d\nThis response was hearsay, as contended by appellant. Nonetheless, the reception of that answer was harmless in view of the information elicited by defense counsel during cross-examination. Defense counsel himself had revealed that appellant had been identified by two people, one of whom was Manuel Crawford. Although defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination did not refer to Anthony Ragland, Rag-land identified appellant at trial and was subjected to cross-examination by defense counsel as to that identification. Under these circumstances, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nNor did the reference to these identifications contained in the direct examination of another police officer subsequently called by the prosecution, add any prejudicial information not already brought out by defense counsel\u2019s questions. In fact, the subsequent officer did not testify that appellant had been identified by the witnesses. He simply stated that while he was on duty on the night of appellant\u2019s arrest, he interviewed Emanuel Crawford, and that he reduced that interview to writing. He did not testify that Crawford identified appellant as the shooter. On re-direct, the second officer was asked,\n\u201cDid Emanuel Crawford make an identification of the man who shot Marvin Wyatt?\u201d\nOver defense counsel\u2019s objection, the officer responded,\n\u201cYes, he did.\u201d\nNo further questions were asked of this officer either by the prosecution or by the defense. Clearly, this re-direct testimony, like that of the first officer, added nothing which had not already been revealed by defense counsel\u2019s questions. Its admission was therefore harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAppellant also argues that he should be granted a new trial because a statement allegedly given by appellant to police after his arrest should have been suppressed as having been obtained in violation of Pa.R.Cr.P. 130\u2019s requirement that an accused be arraigned \u201cwithout unnecessary delay\u201d following arrest. That contention, however, has been waived because it was not raised in appellant\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress, nor at trial, but was raised for the first time in post-verdict motions. Commonwealth v. Newsome, 462 Pa. 106, 337 A.2d 904 (1975).\nWe turn then to appellant\u2019s contention that an in-court identification made of him by Anthony Ragland was tainted by an illegal pre-trial identification procedure. Through his counsel, appellant presented a pre-trial motion to suppress the proposed in-court identification testimony of Anthony Ragland. That motion was denied and Ragland was permitted to testify to the jury that appellant was the person he saw shoot Marvin Wyatt. Appellant points out that Ragland initially picked appellant\u2019s photograph from an array of ten displayed to him by police early in the morning of June 19, 1974, at which time it is argued, appellant \u201cwas the primary focus of the police investigation and [at which time] the police had formed the intention to arrest [him].\u201d Appellant contends, therefore, that adversary proceedings had been initiated against him and that he was entitled to counsel at the time of the photographic identification made by the witness Ragland. See Commonwealth v. Richman, 458 Pa. 167, 320 A.2d 351 (1974), Commonwealth v. Whiting, 439 Pa. 205, 266 A.2d 738 (1970) (initiation of adversary proceedings, and requirement of counsel commences with the arrest). This out-of-court identification allegedly resulting from an invalid uncounselled photographic identification procedure was not introduced into evidence at trial, however, and we therefore need not decide whether appellant was entitled to the representation of counsel at the time of that pre-trial photographic array. The only issue with which we must now be concerned is whether the in-court identification made by the witness Ragland was impermissibly tainted by the pre-trial procedure (assuming, arguendo, that the pre-trial procedure was invalid), and was therefore improperly admitted into evidence at trial.\nWhere the admissability of the evidence of the pre-trial procedure itself is not at issue, we have applied the test of Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417, 9 L.Ed.2d 441, 455 (1968):\n\u201c[w]hether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which the instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u201d\nSee Commonwealth v. Spencer, 442 Pa. 328, 275 A.2d 299 (1971) . The question then becomes one of determining whether the prosecution has clearly established the independent origin of the in-court identification for, as recognized in Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972) , the presence of other factors could indicate that the in-court identification was reliable despite the illegality of the pre-trial identification process. See also, Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 88 S.Ct. 967, 19 L.Ed.2d 1247 (1968). The Neil v. Biggers, supra, opinion addressed itself to \u201cthe factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of misidentification\u201d and concluded that consideration should be given to\n\u201cthe opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and the length of time between the crime and the confrontation.\u201d\nId., 409 U.S. at 199, 93 S.Ct. at 382, 34 L.Ed.2d at 411. Similarly, in United States v. Higgins, 458 F.2d 461 (3d Cir. 1972), the court set forth and applied the following criteria to determine the reliability of an in-court identification:\n\u201c(1) the manner in which the pretrial identification was conducted; (2) the witness\u2019 prior opportunity to observe the alleged criminal act; (3) the existence of any discrepancies between the defendant\u2019s actual description and any description given by the witness before the photographic identification; (4) any previous identification by the witness of some other person; (5) any previous identification of the defendant himself; (6) failure to identify the defendant on a prior occasion; and (7) the lapse of time between the alleged act and the out-of-court identification.\u201d\nId. at 465.\nApplication of the Higgins criteria to the facts of the instant case indicates that the prosecution has met its burden of establishing an independent basis for the in-court identification. First, the pre-trial procedure consisted of showing the witness ten photographs, one of which was appellant. Appellant does not now argue that the photographs themselves were overly suggestive in any way. Indeed, at the pre-trial suppression hearing the prosecution presented evidence indicating that the nine photographs of persons other than appellant were of persons of similar age, complexion, and hair style. The record also indicates that the witness was not told that the group of ten photographs contained one of a suspect in this case; he was simply given the ten photographs and asked if he recognized any of them. After viewing the photographs for two or three minutes, Ragland picked out appellant\u2019s picture and said that he was the person who had shot Wyatt.\nAs to the rest of the Higgins criteria quoted above, the prosecution\u2019s evidence at the suppression hearing established that the witness Ragland viewed Wyatt\u2019s killer for a period of approximately five minutes, while all three were standing on a street corner which was illuminated from overhead by a mercury vapor type street light. For most of this time, the witness was within eight to twelve feet of the shooter. Based on this view, Ragland had, prior to identifying appellant\u2019s photograph, described Wyatt\u2019s assailant to the police. That description was consistent with appellant\u2019s appearance. Moreover, that was the only identification of the killer made by Ragland prior to the pre-trial suppression hearing (Rag-land was never requested to pick Wyatt\u2019s assailant from a line-up, nor were any other photographs shown to him). Lastly, although approximately nine months had elapsed between the time of the shooting and the pre-trial suppression hearing, Ragland\u2019s testimony at that hearing was positive and consistent, and unshaken on cross-examination. Allowing him to testify at trial that appellant was the person he saw shoot Wyatt was therefore not error.\nNext we consider appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court erroneously limited defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of the prosecution\u2019s key witness, Anthony Ragland, regarding his knowledge of an identification of the perpetrator allegedly given to the police by Crawford, the details of which allegedly contradicted Ragland\u2019s identification. This attempt was objected to by the prosecution, and the court sustained the objection, having concluded that the proposed cross-examination would elicit inadmissable hearsay testimony from Ragland. Whether or not the proposed question was objectionable on hearsay grounds need not now concern us for it is clear that even if the prosecution\u2019s objection was erroneously sustained, appellant was not prejudiced thereby. The only thing that appellant was prevented from doing was to ask Ragland if he knew that Crawford had described Wyatt\u2019s killer as having worn a hat at the time of the shooting, whereas Ragland, in his original description to police, said that the killer was bareheaded. Both witnesses, according to the prosecution\u2019s evidence, had identified appellant as the killer. Thus, defense counsel\u2019s attempt to impeach Ragland\u2019s credibility by questioning him regarding Crawford\u2019s identification, went not to the substance of the identification, but rather to some minor peripheral matter. Furthermore, in rejecting defense counsel\u2019s reasons for wanting to question Ragland regarding Crawford\u2019s identification of appellant, the trial court stated,\n\u201cI understand that the Commonwealth is looking for the witness [Crawford].\nIf before the trial is over at a proper time you again wish to ask Mr. Ragland this question and if at that time Mr.\u2019 Crawford still has not been produced I will then consider your request at that time.\u201d\nDefense counsel never renewed his attempt to question Ragland on this issue. Moreover, defense counsel was allowed, as has been discussed previously in this opinion, to question two police officers who were on duty on the night of the homicide as to these allegedly conflicting identifications by Ragland and Crawford. Any error the trial court may have committed in limiting cross-examination of Rag-land was therefore harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nLastly, we come to the question of whether the trial court erred in refusing to allow defense counsel to cross-examine the prosecution witness, Ragland, regarding Rag-land\u2019s alleged record as a juvenile offender. Appellant argues that he was denied his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him because the trial court\u2019s ruling effectively prevented him from pursuing one avenue of attack against this prosecution witness\u2019s credibility.\nThe facts surrounding this issue are as follows. As previously mentioned, Anthony Ragland was the prosecution\u2019s key identification witness. Midway through his cross-examination of Ragland, defense counsel apparently requested the prosecuting assistant district attorney to give him a copy of Ragland\u2019s juvenile record. All that appears on the record regarding this request is what follows:\n\u201c[Assistant District Attorney]: Your Honor, Mr. D\u2019Ambrosio has made a request upon me which I would like to see the Court about.\n. Conference in Chambers .\nTHE COURT: The juvenile record of this witness is inadmissible and may not be used for purposes of cross-examination.\nEnd of conference in Chambers . . . \u201d\nIt is apparent therefore that what was expressly refused by the trial court was counsel\u2019s request to examine Rag-land\u2019s juvenile record. The basis of that refusal, of course, was the court\u2019s belief that any questioning of Ragland by defense counsel regarding Ragland\u2019s juvenile record would have been improper. The prosecution now argues that the trial court\u2019s action was correct because the results of juvenile adjudications are always inadmissible for impeachment purposes. In support of this proposition, the prosecution cites Commonwealth v. Katchmer, 453 Pa. 461, 309 A.2d 591 (1973), and the Juvenile Records Act of 1972, Act of Dec. 6, 1972, P.L. 1464, No. 333, 11 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 50-102 et seq.\nIn Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974), however, the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation requires that a defendant in a state criminal case be allowed to impeach the credibility of a prosecution witness by cross-examination directed at possible bias deriving from the witness\u2019s probationary status as a juvenile delinquent notwithstanding that such impeachment would conflict with the state\u2019s asserted interest in preserving the confidentiality of juvenile delinquency proceedings. The prosecution does not contend that Davis is inapplicable in Pennsylvania, but rather, it argues that Davis requires only that a defendant be allowed to cross-examine regarding the witness\u2019s juvenile record when such cross-examination is designed to show the witness\u2019s bias. In the instant case, according to the prosecution, defense counsel\u2019s request was a general one, seeking permission to explore the witness\u2019s juvenile record on cross-examination, without any mention being made of a possible theory of bias on the part of the witness which could have brought the situation within the ambit of Davis. Without such an assertion of bias, contends the prosecution, the trial court properly followed Katchmer, supra, in denying defense counsel\u2019s request. Specifically, the prosecution argues:\n\u201cit is claimed [by appellant] that possibly some bias on the part of Ragland might have been revealed had the questioning been permitted. In light of his inability at trial or on appeal to specify how this might have been achieved, it is apparent that defendant\u2019s position is based on no more than speculation even at present. The Commonwealth submits that if the protection of anonymity for juvenile offenders provided by the Juvenile Act of 1972 is ever to be violated, this should only be on the basis of a concrete demonstration of necessity to prove particular bias or prejudice, which is totally lacking in this case.\u201d\n(Prosecution brief, pg. 13)\nIn Commonwealth v. Katchmer, supra, we held that the trial court committed reversible error in permitting the prosecution to cross-examine defense alibi witnesses concerning prior juvenile offenses. In doing so, we said,\n\u201c[t]his Court has in the past permitted the use of prior convictions of felonies or misdemeanors in the nature of crimen falsi to impeach the credibility of a witness. More recently, we have recognized that, in order to prevent smearing rather than merely discrediting of the witness, such impeachment should be limited to crimes involving dishonesty or false statement. Applying that test to the case at bar, we have serious doubts that under-age drinking involves a character trait that would suggest a propensity for false swearing.\nHowever, more important considerations compel the conclusion that the cross-examination in this case was improper. We have long held that prior bad acts not resulting in a conviction are not admissible to impeach a witness\u2019 credibility. Thus, the fact of a prior arrest cannot be used to challenge credibility. We expressed the rationale for such a rule in [Commonwealth v. Ross, 434 Pa. 167, 252 A.2d 661 (1969)]: \u2018As a general rule, however, there must be a conviction of the felony or misdemeanor before such evidence is relevant, because there is a vast difference between a conviction and a mere accusation. An inquiry as to a mere arrest or indictment is not permitted because an arrest or an indictment does not establish guilt, and the reception of such evidence would merely constitute the reception of somebody\u2019s hearsay assertion of the witness\u2019 guilt. 3 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 980(a) (3d ed. 1940).\u2019 \u201d 434 Pa. at 171, 252 A.2d 661, at 662.\n\u201cAssuming arguendo that the witnesses had been adjudged delinquent such an adjudication would not have constituted a criminal conviction under the terms of the Juvenile Court Act of 1933 which provides: \u2018No order made by any juvenile court shall operate to impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by the criminal laws of the Commonwealth, nor shall any child be deemed to be a criminal by reason of any such order or be deemed to have been convicted of a crime.\u2019 Act of June 2, 1933, P.L. 1433, \u00a7 19,11 P.S. \u00a7 261, repealed, Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1464, No. 333, \u00a7 337, 11 P.S. \u00a7 50-337 (Supp. 1973-74). The legislature explicitly has directed that juvenile adjudications do not rise to the level of an adult criminal conviction. Such adjudications have therefore been held to be inadmissible for impeachment purposes.\u201d (Citations and footnotes omitted.)\n453 at 464-466, 309 A.2d at 593.\nIf, as is now asserted by appellant, Ragland\u2019s juvenile record could have been used to show a motive for testifying against appellant (for example, in an effort to secure more lenient disposition of pending juvenile delinquency adjudications), the rationale behind the Katchmer prohibition would not apply to the instant case. Furthermore, the Katchmer rationale applies only to the attempted use by the prosecution of a witness juvenile record. In that situation, no countervailing confrontation right considerations are present. Where the accused desires to use a witness\u2019s juvenile record to impeach credibility, therefore, the different considerations require a different result.\nWhat the trial court did in this case, however, was to prevent defense counsel from obtaining the prosecution\u2019s copy of Ragland\u2019s alleged juvenile record. By doing that, the trial court made it impossible for counsel to know whether or not that record contained anything upon which he could argue that the witness was biased against the defendant. Appellant cannot now be required to have established Ragland\u2019s bias at trial when the record indicates that he was denied access to information on which he might have based such an allegation. The trial court\u2019s refusal was therefore error.\nThe record, however, is not clear as to whether that error prejudiced appellant in any way. (The record does not even indicate whether or not Ragland, in fact, had a record of juvenile offenses, let alone whether that record, if it exists, would support appellant\u2019s claim of bias). We therefore remand the matter to the trial court with instructions that appellant, through his counsel, be given access to Ragland\u2019s juvenile record. Counsel will then be able to argue to the trial court what, if any, use could have been made of that record had he been allowed to use it to cross-examine Ragland. If, in the court\u2019s opinion, its original refusal to allow defense counsel to cross-examine Ragland on the basis of this juvenile record prevented appellant from presenting to the jury evidence regarding Ragland\u2019s possible bias, or other information which would bring the case within the requirements of Davis, supra, it shall vacate the judgment of sentence and order a new trial. If, on the other hand, Ragland has no juvenile record, or if in the court\u2019s opinion, appellant has failed to assert any facts which would bring the case within the rationale of Davis, supra, it shall affirm its original order. Either party may then file an appropriate appeal.\nCase remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nROBERTS and NIX, JJ., filed dissenting opinions.\nLARSEN, J., dissents."}
