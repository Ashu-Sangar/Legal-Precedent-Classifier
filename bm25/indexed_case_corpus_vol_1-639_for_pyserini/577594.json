{"id": "577594", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Chief Jiracs Jones,\nOn August 24, 1969, appellant, Donna Brown, a minor, wMle a guest at a Pennsylvania National Guard outing in Meadowbrook, sustained injuries when a National Guard jeep in wMch she was riding as a passenger was involved in an accident occasioned by the negligence of the operator, a Guardsman.\nBy her guardian, appellant brought a trespass action seeking damages for her injuries and the expense incurred for her treatment. The Commonwealth, by demurrer, interposed the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The Commonwealth Court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s preliminary objections and dismissed appellants\u2019 complaint. An appeal was taken from dismissal of the complaint. Act of July 31, 1970, P. L. 673, \u00a7203, 17 P.S. \u00a7211.203.\nThe questions raised by this appeal reduce themselves to a frontal assault upon the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The subparts of tMs challenge question (1) whether sovereign immunity should be abolished, (2) whether it earn be abolished and (3) whether it applies at all under the factual circumstances of tMs case. The desirability of limiting our decisions to the narrowest of issues necessitates the leading consideration of the question whether sovereign immunity applies to these factual circumstances.\nAppellants argue that because the Commonwealth has obtained liability insurance, which may provide compensation for the damagees resulting from this incident, the doctrine of sovereign immunity should not apply. Cf. Falco v. Pados, 444 Pa. 372, 282 A. 2d 351 (1971); Flagiello v. Pennsylvania Hospital, 417 Pa. 486, 208 A. 2d 193 (1965).\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s Department of Property and Supplies obtained automobile liability insurance, protective of the officers, enlisted men and employees of the National Guard, in conformity with the Administrative Code of 1929, Act of April 9, 1929, P. L. 177, \u00a72404, as amended, 71 P.S. 634.\nThe Commonwealth concedes that the Administrative Code provision, as implemented by the purchase of insurance by the Department of Property and Supplies, represents an avenue of compensation open to appellants, an avenue which they have failed to utilize. Appellants urge, by analogy to this Court\u2019s decisions in Flagiello and Falco, that the existence of insurance coverage obviates tbe need for \u201coutmoded\u201d law. We reject tbe notion that tbe existence of statutorily mandated public liability insurance evidences a legislative intent to reject sovereign immunity in tbis context.\nArticle I, Section 11 of tbe Pennsylvania Constitution provides that suits may be brought against tbe Commonwealth \u201cin such cases as tbe Legislature may by law direct.\u201d While insurance coverage is provided, and tbe Commonwealth concedes tbe existence of a system of compensation in tbis factual setting, we cannot justify a bolding that tbe Legislature, by enacting Section 2404 of tbe Administrative Code, intended to create a sovereign immunity exception as envisioned by Article I, Section 11 of tbe Pennsylvania Constitution. Section 2404 does not permit tbe injured or damaged party to sue tbe Commonwealth. We find no legislative exception to sovereign immunity in tbis case. We will not create one by judicial edict.\nAlthough appellants frame tbe separate issues of whether sovereign immunity can and should be abolished, these considerations are inextricably woven into tbe real question here involved: may we strike down a policy embodied by tbe Commonwealth\u2019s Constitution absent some compelling showing that Article I, Section 11 is in conflict with tbe Federal Constitution?\nAppellants urge that because sovereign immunity was judicially created, and improvidently so, tbis Court should hasten its judicial demise. Article I, Section 11 of our Constitution compels the conclusion, however, that this Commonwealth\u2019s immunity is constitutionally, not judicially, mandated: \u201cSuits may be brought against the Commonwealth in such manner, in such courts and in such cases as the Legislature may by lava direct.\u201d (Emphasis added) No other conclusion is possible than that it falls to the Legislature to determine the circumstances under which immunity may he waived. Commonwealth v. Orsatti, 448 Pa. 72, 292 A. 2d 313 (1972); Conrad v. Commonwealth Department of Highways, 441 Pa. 530, 272 A. 2d 470 (1971); Meagher v. Commonwealth, 439 Pa. 532, 266 A. 2d 684 (1970); Barnnard v. New York State Natural Gas Corp., 404 Pa. 269, 172 A. 2d 306 (1961); Stouffer v. Morrison, 400 Pa. 497, 162 A. 2d 378 (1960); Commonwealth v. Berks County, 364 Pa. 447, 72 A. 2d 129 (1950).\nAppellants also argue that Article I, Section 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution is repugnant to the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Federal Constitution. The basis of appellants\u2019 constitutional argument is that Article I, Section 11 is uncertain by its own terms, and so void for vagueness, and that it confers upon the Legislature the unfettered discretion to arbitrarily formulate exceptions to the doctrine of sovereign immunity.\nThe vagueness standard is inapplicable in this context. Article I, Section 11 establishes a standardless prerogative for the Legislature to consent to suit against the Commonwealth. The due process vagueness standard applies to void legislation which limits the ability of those to whom the statute is applied to understand that which is prohibited or mandated. Since Article I, Section 11 provides only a framework within which the Legislature may operate, the void-for-vagueness argument is inapposite here.\nSimilarly, because Article I, Section 11 is not self-executing, and because no classification is possible without legislative implementation, this constitutional provision cannot be considered discriminatory for equal protection purposes.\nWhether the doctrine of sovereign immunity should be modified in this Commonwealth is a legislative question. We could not base a contrary holding upon our impatience with the Legislature\u2019s failure to act as speedily and comprehensively as we believe it should.\nOrder affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nIn this action in trespass the appellants named only the Commonwealth. They did not name the Guardsman as a party defendant.\nArgument on the preliminary objections was heard by a three-judge panel of the Commonwealth Court including Judges Jambs C. Crumlish, Jb., Harry A. Kramer and Theodore O. Rosees.\n\u201cThe Department of Property and Supplies shall have the power, and its duty shall be:\n(b) To procure automobile liability insurance, covering vehicles owned by tbe Commonwealth. . . .\n\u201cAll automobile liability insurance procured by the Department of Property and Supplies hereunder shall protect both the Commonwealth and the State officer or employe operating the vehicle, or State officers and employes and officers and enlisted men of the Pennsylvania National Guard . . . against claims for damages for injury to person or property. . . .\u201d\nFlagiello v. Pennsylvania Hospital, 417 Pa. 486, 208 A. 2d 193 (1965), relying to some extent upon the availability of liability insurance to the charitable institution, disallowed the defendant hospital\u2019s assertion of charitable immunity. Falco v. Pados, 444 Pa. 372, 282 A. 2d 351 (1971), abolished parental immunity by permitting tbe unemancipated child to recover against the insured parent.\nIt is appellants\u2019 position that an attempt to recover against the Commonwealth\u2019s policy was thwarted, by the Guard Insurance Adjuster\u2019s failure to cooperate in the claims process, and that the only alternative was to initiate this action so that discovery might disclose the identity of the negligent Guardsman. The Commonwealth claims that the appellants have not exercised due diligence in attempting to discover the identity of the Guardsman and that the Guard will disclose his identity on request.\nAs this appeal concerns the propriety of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrer to appellants\u2019 complaint the alleged intransigence of the Guard\u2019s Adjuster is irrelevant.\nWe reiterate our urging of the need for comprehensive legislative action permissible under Article I, Section 11. Stouffer v. Morrison, 400 Pa. 497, 162 A. 2d 378 (1960) (concurring opinion by the late Mr. Justice Cohen joined by this writer)."}
