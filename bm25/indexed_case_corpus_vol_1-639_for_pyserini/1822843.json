{"id": "1822843", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nIn this appeal by the Commonwealth, the issue we must decide is whether the Medicaid Fraud Abuse and Control Act, 62 Pa.S. \u00a7 1407(a)(4), \u00a7 1407(a)(7) and \u00a7 1407(a)(9), requires proof of knowing or intentional conduct to establish criminal culpability.\nNorman Lurie, a licensed dentist and the appellee herein, was arrested and charged with 22 counts of Medicaid Fraud. The charges arose out of his treatment of 13 patients while he was employed at a Philadelphia dental clinic during 1984. Each of the counts was separately charged as a violation of 62 Pa.S. \u00a7 1407(a)(1), \u00a7 1407(a)(4), \u00a7 1407(a)(7), and \u00a7 1407(a)(9) thus cumulating a total of 88 charges against Dr. Lurie. In the charges, the Commonwealth alleges (a) that the Department of Public Welfare (DPW) was billed for services not rendered; (b) that DPW was billed for non-compensable services; and (c) that certain billings for dental services made by the appellee to DPW were upgraded in order to obtain compensation greater than the actual work done would allow.\nPrior to trial, the appellee filed a motion in limine asserting that all charges brought under 62 P.S. \u00a7 1407 require proof of intent, as opposed to recklessness, to establish guilt. The Commonwealth, on the other hand, argued that 62 P.S. \u00a7 1407(a)(4), (a)(7) and (a)(9) required only reckless or criminally negligent conduct for criminal culpability. The trial court granted appellee\u2019s motion in limine ruling that the culpability necessary to sustain a conviction under 62 Pa.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1407(a)(4), (a)(7) and (a)(9) is proof of a knowing or intentional presentation of fraudulent claims. The trial court held that proof of recklessness in presenting claims to the DPW could not sustain a conviction. Along with granting the motion in limine, the trial court certified that its interlocutory order involved a controlling question of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal may ultimately advance the ultimate determination of the question. Pa.R.A.P. 1312. Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702(b) and Pa.R.A.P. 1311, the Commonwealth timely filed a Petition for Permission to Appeal the trial court\u2019s interlocutory order in the Superior Court. Permission to appeal was granted and the Superior Court affirmed. 379 Pa.Super. 661, 545 A.2d 385.\nThe Medicaid Fraud Abuse and Control Act, 62 Pa.S. \u00a7 1407 provides in pertinent part:\n\u00a7 1407. Provider prohibited acts, criminal penalties and civil remedies\n(a) It shall be unlawful for any person to:\n(1) Knowingly or intentionally present for allowance or payment any false or fraudulent claim or cost report for furnishing services or merchandise under medical assistance, or to knowingly present for allowance or payment any claim or cost report for medically unnecessary services or merchandise under medical assistance, or to knowingly submit false information, for the purpose of obtaining greater compensation than that to which he is legally entitled for furnishing services or merchandise under medical assistance, or to knowingly submit false information for the purpose of obtaining authorization for furnishing services or merchandise under medical assistance. * * * * # *\n(4) Submit a claim for services, supplies or equipment which were not rendered to a recipient.\n* * * * * *\n(7) Submit a claim which misrepresents the description of services, supplies or equipment dispensed or provided; the dates of services; the identity of the recipient; the identity of the attending, prescribing or referring practitioner; or the identity of the actual provider.\n(9) Submit a claim for a service or item which was not rendered by the provider.\nThe Commonwealth argues, as a matter of law, that \u00a7 1407(a)(4), (a)(7), and (a)(9) do not require the prosecution to establish a knowing and/or intentional mental state of mind to prove criminal culpability and sustain the accused\u2019s conviction. Rather, the Commonwealth vigorously submits that proof of recklessness on the part of the accused provider is sufficient to support a conviction. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument is based upon the readily discernible fact that subsections 1407(a)(4), (a)(7), and (a)(9) do not contain \u201cmens rea\u201d or \u201cintent\u201d language. Contrasted with the language of \u00a7 1407(a)(1) which expressly requires a knowing or intentional act, subsections (a)(4), . (a)(7), and (a)(9) are silent with respect to the requirement of knowing or intentional conduct.\nThe paramount concern in interpreting and construing the provisions of a statute is the intention of the legislature. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a). It is our obligation to determine and give effect to that intention. Id.\n\u201c[S]ections of statutes are not to be isolated from the context in which they arise such that an individual interpretation is accorded one section which does not take into account the related sections of the same statute. Statutes do not exist sentence by; sentence. Their sections and sentences comprise a composite of their stated purpose. All sections and sentences that address that purpose are subsumed in each other and in the entire context of the statute.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Revtai, 516 Pa. 53, 63, 532 A.2d 1, 5 (1987). The principle of statutory construction affirmed in Revtai is helpful in construing the provisions of the Medicaid Fraud Abuse and Control Act before us in the instant case. Subsections (a)(4), (a)(7) and (a)(9) of \u00a7 1407 are not to be isolated and read out of the context of the entire statute. They are not to be given an individual interpretation which fails to take into account the provisions of subsection (a)(1) and the stated purpose of the Act.\nThe purpose of the Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Control Act is \u201cto eliminate fraudulent, abusive and deceptive conduct and practices that may occur.\u201d Introductory paragraph of Act 1980, July 10, P.L. 493, No. 105. In speaking of \u201cfraudulent, abusive and deceptive\u201d conduct, the legislature most certainly is referring to willful conduct as opposed to recklessness or negligence. Subsection (1) of \u00a7 1407(a) declares it unlawful: (i) to knowingly or intentionally present for payment of any false or fraudulent claim for furnishing services or merchandise under medical assistance; (ii) to knowingly or intentionally present for payment any claim for medically unnecessary service or merchandise; (iii) to knowingly submit false information for the purpose of obtaining greater compensation than that to which the provider would be entitled; and, (iv) to knowingly or intentionally submit false information for the purpose of obtaining authorization to furnish medical services or merchandise.\nSubsection (a)(4) of \u00a7 1407 makes it unlawful to submit a claim for services or merchandise which was not delivered to a recipient. It is fundamental that to knowingly submit a claim for services, etc. that were not rendered is to present a false or fraudulent claim for payment. To recklessly or negligently present a claim for services, etc. which were not delivered does not amount to a knowing presentment of a false or fraudulent claim. Reading this provision in the context of the entire statute, including the \u201cmens rea\u201d requirement of subsection (a)(1), it is reasonable to conclude that the General Assembly did not intend to treat recklessness and/or negligence in presenting claims the same as willful fraud.\nSubsection (a)(7) of \u00a7 1407 makes it unlawful to submit a claim which misrepresents the service or merchandise delivered, the date or dates of delivery, the identity of the person or persons who received the services or merchandise, the identity of the provider, etc. Again, it is fundamental that to purposely misrepresent any of the information described in subsection (a)(7), is to knowingly present a false or fraudulent claim for payment. On the other hand, a claim which recklessly or negligently misrepresents any of the described information does not involve a knowing presentment of a fraudulent claim and is not accorded criminality.\nSubsection (a)(9) of \u00a7 1407 makes it unlawful to submit a claim for something that was not provided by the provider. This subsection is similar to subsections (a)(4) and (a)(7) in that purposely submitting a claim for a service or item not delivered by the provider-claimant is fraud and subject to the criminal sanctions of the statute. Where a provider recklessly or negligently submits a claim for a service or item not rendered, there is no fraud and criminal sanctions are not implicated.\nThe penalties for violating the provisions of the Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Control Statute are set forth at \u00a7 1407(b)(1):\nA person who violates any provision of subsection (a), excepting subsection (a)(ll), is guilty of a felony of the third degree for each such violation with a maximum penalty of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) and seven years imprisonment. A violation of subsection (a) shall be deemed to continue so long as the course of conduct or the defendant\u2019s complicity therein continues;____\nThe appellant Commonwealth argues that since \u00a7 1407(a)(4), (a)(7) and (a)(9) are silent as to the requirement of knowing or intentional conduct, the mens rea element is not essential to sustain a conviction under any or all of these subsections. However, it would be wholly inconsistent and unreasonable for the General Assembly to make it a felony punishable by a maximum penalty of a fine of fifteen thousand ($15,000) dollars and a term of imprisonment of seven years for violating \u00a7 1407(a)(1) by knowingly or intentionally presenting any false or fraudulent claim for services or merchandise, and likewise deem it a felony with the identical maximum penalties under \u00a7 1407(a)(4) for recklessly or negligently submitting a claim for services or merchandise not delivered to the recipient. It is a principle of statutory construction that the legislature is presumed not to intend a result that is absurd or unreasonable. Hatchard v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Company, 516 Pa. 184, 532 A.2d 346 (1987); 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1922(1). The interpretation which the Commonwealth urges us to adopt and apply to \u00a7 1407(a)(4), (a)(7) and (a)(9) most certainly would produce an absurd and unreasonable result. A provider who recklessly or negligently submitted a claim for services not delivered would be treated as a felon subject to a fine and imprisonment the same as a provider who schemed to intentionally defraud the medical assistance program. We cannot presume that the legislature intended such a result.\nAdditionally, the provisions of \u00a7 1407(a) are penal in nature and thus, must be strictly construed. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(b)(1); also see Milewski v. Commonwealth, 93 Pa. Commw. 120, 500 A.2d 1261 (1985). The Commonwealth argues that the principle that \u201cpenal laws are to be strictly construed\u201d is an obsolete standard no longer applicable in this modern era. The Commonwealth cites Section 105 of the Preliminary Provisions of the Crimes Code which sets forth that: \u201cThe provisions of this title shall be construed according to the fair import of their terms.... \u201d 18 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 105. However, it is clear from the explicit language of Section 105 that the \u201cfair import\u201d principle of construction specifically applies to the provisions of the Crimes Code (Title 18). It does not supercede the \u201cstrict construction\u201d standard outside of the Crimes Code prescribed by 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(b)(1). Thus, contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s assertions, both the trial court and the Superior Court correctly applied the \u201cstrict construction\u201d principle to the penal provisions of the Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Control Act, 62 P.S. \u00a7 1407(a).\nAs the lower court pointed out, \u00a7 1407(a)(1) is a rather general provision setting forth in broad terms the fraudulent conduct that is prohibited by the statute. Subsection (a)(1) describes knowing and intentional conduct amounting to fraud. It describes conduct involving guilty knowledge. Similarly, \u00a7 1407(a)(4), (a)(7) and (a)(9) specify conduct of the same kind and nature as that delineated in \u00a7 1407(a)(1). Each of the relevant subsections describe fraudulent acts. All of the prohibited acts are classified as third degree felonies and all carry the same maximum fine and prison term.\nFraud involves deliberate and intentional conduct calculated to deceive. Frowen v. Blank, 493 Pa. 137, 425 A.2d 412 (1981). Reckless conduct or negligence is not conduct deliberately calculated to deceive. Yet the Commonwealth would have us equate recklessness and negligence with fraud in finding that \u00a7 1407(a)(7) and (a)(9) of the Medicaid Fraud and Abuse Control Act have been violated.\nGenerally, when the proscribed conduct necessarily involves deceitful acts and acts of fraud, criminal intent or guilty knowledge is an essential element of the offense. Considering the purpose and the raison d\u2019etre of the Medicaid Fund and Abuse Control Act, we hold that an essential element of any violation of \u00a7 1407(a)(4), (a)(7) and (a)(9) is knowing or intentional conduct as specifically set forth in \u00a7 1407(a)(1).\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nMcDERMOTT, J., dissents."}
