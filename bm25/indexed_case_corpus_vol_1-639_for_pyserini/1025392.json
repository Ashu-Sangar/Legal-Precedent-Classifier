{"id": "1025392", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe agree with the conclusion of the court below, that the coal royalties in question belonged to the widow, as life-tenant of the estate of her former husband, and as such they passed directly to her. As there were no debts of the husband, the intervention of the executor was unnecessary. See Duffy\u2019s Est., 209 Pa. 390. The order of the court below, refusing petition to compel the executrix to account, is affirmed."}
