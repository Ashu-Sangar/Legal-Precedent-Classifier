{"id": "18324", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThis case involves an employer\u2019s petition to terminate workers\u2019 compensation benefits due to the claimant\u2019s complete recovery, where a previous petition based on the same grounds was denied. Commonwealth Court held that the second petition \u201cmust fail by reason of issue preclusion,\u201d because the employer failed to demonstrate that the claimant\u2019s condition had changed after the denial of the first termination petition. King v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (K-Mart Corporation), 664 A.2d 1087, 1091 (Pa.Cmwlth.1995). We reverse.\nDonna Bang injured her back on January 16, 1980, while working for K-Mart Corporation. Pursuant to a Notice of Compensation Payable, K-Mart began paying benefits for total disability at the rate of $121.00 per week. In July of 1983, K-Mart filed a petition to terminate benefits, asserting that King was no longer disabled. In support of its petition, K-Mart presented the deposition testimony of Dr. John T. Williams, who had examined King on July 14, 1983, and was unable to find any cause or explanation for her complaints of pain. He offered the opinion that King was able to return to her normal work duties. King presented the deposition testimony of Dr. Ronald B. Greene, who had examined her on February 17, 1984. He described King\u2019s condition as chronic coccydynia and opined that she was permanently disabled from working. In July of 1987, the referee denied the termination petition based on his finding that Greene\u2019s testimony was more persuasive than Williams\u2019s.\nIn February of 1990, K-Mart filed a second petition to terminate. In support of this petition, K-Mart presented the deposition of Dr. Marc Manzione, who had examined King on August 8, 1989, and found no objective physical basis for King\u2019s complaints of pain. King presented the deposition of Dr. Andrew Newman, who examined her on May 3, 1990, and the earlier deposition of Dr. Greene. King also testified herself, as did her husband.\nOn June 18, 1993, the termination petition was granted. The referee found Dr. Newman\u2019s testimony less credible than Dr. Manzione\u2019s, and therefore accepted Dr. Manzione\u2019s conclusions and rejected Dr. Newman\u2019s. He found that, \u201cAs of the date of Manzione\u2019s examination, Ms. King was fully recovered from her work-related injury. Any disability that she suffered from was the result of some other cause and not related to her work injury.\u201d The referee rejected King\u2019s argument that because of the result of the earlier petition K-Mart was barred by res judicata from bringing this petition.\nOn appeal, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board affirmed. The Board agreed with the referee that this termination petition was not barred by res judicata, and determined that there was substantial competent evidence, in the form of Dr. Manzione\u2019s testimony, to support the finding that King\u2019s disability from her work-related injury had ceased.\nOn further appeal, Commonwealth Court reversed. The court\u2019s opinion contained a review of the doctrine of res judicata derived from its decision in Hebden v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Bethenergy Mines), 142 Pa. Cmwlth.176, 597 A.2d 182 (1991). The court acknowledged that this Court had reversed the order in that case, 534 Pa. 327, 632 A.2d 1302 (1993), but explained that our decision, while agreeing with the discussion of res judicata, indicated that an employer, in proceedings to. modify or terminate benefits, may not relitigate the original diagnosis. Unfortunately, the remainder of the Commonwealth Court opinion gave no indication of the reason for the citation to Hebden or the part it played in the analysis and decision of this case. It is thus unclear whether the court found our decision in Hebden controlling in this case, or whether the court was merely reiterating the language of its own decision in Hebden with respect to the doctrine of res judicata, finding our decision inapplicable but discussing it simply as the later history of the cited case. We find our Hebden decision entirely inapplicable.\nThe claimant in Hebden was awarded workers\u2019 compensation benefits by a referee upon a finding that he had coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis. The employer later sought modification. In the course of explaining their opinion that the claimant was not disabled, the employer\u2019s medical experts testified that the claimant had bronchial asthma, not pneumoconiosis. One of these doctors conceded on cross-examination that if the claimant did not have pneumoconiosis at the time the doctor examined the claimant, he would not have had it previously. This coincided with the claimant\u2019s physician\u2019s testimony that pneumoconiosis is irreversible.\nNevertheless, the referee accepted the employer\u2019s experts\u2019 testimony that the claimant did not have pneumoconiosis and terminated benefits, a decision that was affirmed by the Board and the Commonwealth Court. In reversing, we determined that the unrefuted testimony that pneumoconiosis is irreversible precluded the employer from asserting and the referee from finding that the claimant did not have the disease.\nHere, despite Dr. Greene\u2019s testimony in the first proceeding that characterized King\u2019s injury as \u201cpermanent,\u201d and Dr. Newman\u2019s testimony in the second proceeding that in his own experience he had never had a coccydynia patient get better, there is no basis in this record for characterizing coccydynia as irreversible. The testimony of Dr. Manzione suggested that coccydynia \u201cgenerally responds to conservative treatment\u201d that protects the area of the coccyx from direct pressure, and that injections and surgery may be employed to relieve the pain. Thus at the very least, K-Mart produced evidence that the condition King had been diagnosed with was changeable.\nK-Mart did not argue and its witness did not suggest that King never suffered a work-related back injury. With respect to both the first and second termination petitions, K-Mart argued only that King was no longer disabled on account of that injury. Nor did K-Mart in the second termination proceeding either explicitly or implicitly challenge the referee\u2019s conclusion in the first proceeding that King was still disabled in 1983.\nPlainly, our decision in Hebden has no bearing on the analysis of this case. Indeed, our opinion in that case recognized that\nthe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act at Section 413 (77 P.S. \u00a7 772) expressly provides that an award may be terminated based upon changes in the employee\u2019s disability. But that raises the logical question of whether an employee\u2019s disability is changeable in a given case. If it is, an employee\u2019s condition may be re-exarnined at a later time to see if he is still disabled or not If it is not, an attempt to re-examine the employee\u2019s.condition is merely a disguised attempt to relitigate what has already been settled. We think the latter is what occurred here.\n534 Pa. at 331, 632 A.2d at 1304. (First two emphases in original, latter emphasis added). In contrast, the former is what occurred in this case.\nEntirely apart from the confusing references to Heb-den, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion here can be read to suggest that where an employer has been unsuccessful once in demonstrating a change in the claimant\u2019s condition, its burden in a later proceeding is not merely to show that the disability has changed or ceased. Rather, the employer must show that the claimant\u2019s condition changed after the earlier proceeding. Such is not the case.\nCommonwealth Court observed that, \u201cLike Dr. Williams, Dr. Manzione also opined that Claimant is no longer disabled and that he could find no explanations for her complaints of pain.\u201d The court then noted that on cross-examination Dr. Manzione \u201cadmitted\u201d that King\u2019s medical condition remained unchanged from the time the first termination petition was filed. 664 A.2d at 1090. The court presented in detail the referee\u2019s findings with regard to the first petition, then repeated that K-Mart\u2019s witness \u201cstated that there was no change in Claimant\u2019s condition since the initial termination petition was filed.\u201d Id. Finally, the court held that the second termination petition failed due to issue preclusion, once again observing that \u201cEmployer failed to demonstrate any change in Claimant\u2019s condition after the ... dismissal of the initial termination petition by the referee.\u201d Id. at 1091.\nSection 413 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 772, provides that a referee\nmay, at any time, modify, reinstate, suspend, or terminate a notice of compensation payable, an original or supplemental agreement or an award ... upon proof that the disability of an injured employe has increased, decreased, recurred, or has temporarily or finally ceased.... Such modification, reinstatement, suspension, or termination shall be made as of the date upon which it is shown that the disability of the injured employe has increased, decreased, recurred, or has temporarily or finally ceased....\nWe can find no reason that the nature of the proof in a second or later termination proceeding should differ from that in a first proceeding. The issue in each instance is whether the claimant\u2019s disability had changed or ceased as of the time specified in that proceeding. Of necessity, an employer\u2019s second termination petition will involve evidence similar to that presented in the first for in each case the employer believes it has marshalled sufficient proof, generally in the form of medical opinion, that the claimant\u2019s disability has ceased. A decision that the claimant\u2019s condition had not changed as of an earlier time should have no effect on a later attempt to demonstrate that the condition has changed as of a later time.\nIn this case, the referee observed King during her testimony, reviewed the deposition testimony of Drs. Manzione, Newman, and Greene, and determined that King\u2019s disability had ceased as of the time Dr. Manzione examined her in 1989. Because his conclusion is supported by substantial evidence in the record, the Commonwealth Court erred in reversing. Accordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board is reinstated.\nNEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nCAPPY, J., files a Concurring Opinion in which CASTILLE, J., joins.\n. The coccyx is the end of the spinal column, colloquially referred to as the tailbone. Coccydynia refers to pain in the area around the coccyx.\n. Commonwealth Court supported this conclusion by reference to a portion of Dr. Manzione\u2019s deposition where the following exchange occurred:\nQ: [by the claimant\u2019s attorney] ... is it your opinion that there was a change in her medical condition from July 1983 [when the first termination petition was filed] until you saw her August 8, 1989 ... ? A: According to this report the patient was having the same complaints then as when I saw her in 1989. So, in that sense I don't think much has changed.\nThe court did not note that counsel prefaced the question by directing Dr. Manzione's attention to Dr. Williams's report from July of 1983, or that K-Mart's counsel objected to the question for this very reason.\nMore importantly, the court seems to have ignored the qualification that Dr. Manzione placed on his answer, i.e., that not much had changed in the sense that King had the same complaints of pain in 1989 as she had in 1983. Dr. Manzione's testimony when viewed in its entirety offered no opinion as to King\u2019s medical condition in 1983 or at any time other than when he examined her."}
