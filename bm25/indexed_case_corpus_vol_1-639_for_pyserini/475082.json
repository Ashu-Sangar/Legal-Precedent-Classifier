{"id": "475082", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an action in trespass by plaintiffs, husband and wife, against defendant. On September 7, 1942, William G. Haskey was operating a motor vehicle in which his wife was a passenger. They were enroute from Easton, Pa., to Flemington, New Jersey. On that date the 19-year-old daughter of Fred E. Williams, with two companions, drove her father\u2019s car with his permission from White Haven, Luzerne County, Pa., en route to Trenton, New Jersey. At Flemington, N. J., at the intersection of Boute No. 30 and Church Street, there was a traffic light. It was alleged that Haskey had stopped his motor vehicle at this intersection in obedience to a traffic signal; that the motor vehicle of Fred E. Williams, driven by his daughter, struck the Haskey motor vehicle causing property damage to the car and personal injuries to Mrs. Haskey.\nBernice Williams, the minor daughter, a recent graduate of Eider Business College, Trenton, New Jersey, had left her clothes and other personal belongings at the college. While staying at her parents\u2019 home in White Haven, Pa., the minor daughter received a job with the Bationing Board at that place. For the purpose of removing from Eider College her clothes and other personal belongings, the minor daughter requested and received permission to use her father\u2019s automobile on September 7, 1942 to. go to Trenton, N. J, While on that mission the accident occurred.\nAfter the trial, the jury returned a verdict for the defendant. Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial was refused by the court in banc. The issues before the jury were (1) the negligence of the driver of defendant\u2019s car (2) the contributory negligence of William G. Haskey, plaintiff husband, and (3) whether .or not the court adequately charged on the subject of the alleged agency of defendant\u2019s daughter in driving the car which was involved in the collision. The court charged the jury on the question of negligence that \u201cthe common law rule or test of negligence has been adopted in New Jersey, and that negligence is defined as' failure of due care in the circumstances \u2014 in this case, failure of due care in the operation of a motor vehicle . . . The rule and test of negligence in New Jersey are essentially the same as the rule and test prevailing in Pennsylvania. The court also charged on! the question of contributory negligence of the plaintiff. In the opinion refusing plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, the court says that it is convinced that the question of William Haskey\u2019s contributory negligence should not have been submitted to the jury as \u201cthere was no evidence that he in any way failed to comply with the law and his duty.\u201d We do not find this to be sufficient reason, for the granting of a new trial. The case was contested on the issue of the agency of defendant\u2019s 19-year-old daughter and the verdict of the jury was obviously based solely on its finding that there was no such agency.\nAs to the question of the agency of Bernice Williams, the 19-year-old driver of defendant\u2019s car, the court in refusing a new trial stated the testimony did not warrant the submission of the question of her agency to the jury. Tt said: \u201c. . . there was no evidence whatever that Bernice on her trip from White Haven to Trenton on the day of the collision was on any mission but her own. She went down for her own purpose, namely, to get her clothes which she had left at college. She had obtained a job and had begun to work in her home town of White Haven. Though she was only nineteen, the use of her father\u2019s car with his consent was not enough for the application of the doctrine of respondeat superior. The family use doctrine has not been adopted in Pennsylvania.\u201d The court also said: \u201cWe have no doubt whatever that Bernice Williams, the xninor driver of defendant\u2019s car, was guilty of negligence and that, if this had been the only question involved, the jury .would have found in favor of the plaintiffs. \u25a0. . . The crucial question upon which plaintiff\u2019s right to recovery depended was the question of Bernice William\u2019s agency on her father\u2019s business or mission.\u201d\nThe court held that the question of agency was ruled by the decision of- the Superior Court in Kunkle v. Thompson, 67 Pa. Superior Ct. 37. In that case the defendant\u2019s car was being driven by his 19-year-old son. The defendant, owner,- was not in the car at the time of the accident. The action was not brought against the son who operated the car, but the plaintiff sought to charge the absent owner with the consequences of the negligent operation of :his car -by his son. In that, case the Superior Court said, quoting from Seheel v. Shaw, 60 Pa. Superior Ct. 73, 76: \u201c \u2018In the case at bar the journey was taken by the chauffeur, with the permission of the master, on an errand solely for the benefit of the chauffeur. The fact that permission was given would not alter the rule as to the master\u2019s liability. The ownership of the car would not make the master liable: Lotz v. Hanlon, 217 Pa. 339....\"\nIn charging the jury in this case, the trial judge said: \u201cIn order to hold the father liable, you must find by the weight of the credible evidence that his daughter on her trip to New Jersey that day was on the business or mission or purpose of her father. In other words, that she was on that occasion his agent. If she acted for herself and for herself alone in making that trip, independent of her father, so far as representing him was .concerned, in- a matter in which he exercised no control or authority and on a mission or errand over which he had no concern, the collision was her responsibility and not his, even though she was at the time a minor and to all intents \u00e1nd purposes , under his control.\u201d Appellants say in their brief: \u201cWe feel, that there should be a new trial also for the reason that, the, Court below accepted the facts as produced by the defendant on the subject of agency and excluded the facts submitted by the plaintiff. The plaintiff submitted an admission on the part of Williams that he had constituted his daughter as his agent to do those things which the father was really bound\u2019to do as a matter of law.\u201d We find no basis for appellant\u2019s statement \u00e1s to William\u2019s admission of his daughter\u2019s agency.\nAppellants contend that the daughter\u2019s agency was established by (1) her statements that her father had given her general instructions that she \u201cshould be careful\u201d in the use of the car; that he \u201chad educated her\u201d and that she had not yet had any gainful employment; that the trip had been arranged by the family and that there was a definite understanding that she was to be back by nine o\u2019clock, and by (2) her father\u2019s testimony that he was interested in his daughter\u2019s welfare and interested in the trip; that he knew the car was safe for her to drive and he saw to it that she had enough money to finance the trip and this money came from him. The jury heard all this evidence and found that there was no agency on the part of the daughter.\nWe find no reversible error in the charge of the court and no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
