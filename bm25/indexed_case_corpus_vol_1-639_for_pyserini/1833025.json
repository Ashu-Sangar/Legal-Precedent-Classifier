{"id": "1833025", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nThe issue raised in this appeal is whether the illegal sale of malt or brewed beverages outside the geographical area for which an importing distributor has been given exclusive distributing rights constitutes a rectifiable deficiency under the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-101 \u2014 8-803, so that the importing distributor may avoid, by discontinuing such illegal sales, the termination for good cause of its distributing rights agreement with an out of state manufacturer.\nAppellant, All Brand Importers, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cAll Brand\u201d), a New York corporation, distributes certain brands of beverages, including Moosehead Beer, Foster\u2019s Lager, Dos Equis Beer, Superior Beer, Pilsner Urquell, Whitbread Ale and MacKesson Stout, to importing distributors in this Commonwealth. Pursuant to an agreement memorialized in writing in a letter to the Liquor Control Board in 1982, appellee, McKeesport Beer Distributors, Inc. (hereinafter \u201cMcKeesport\u201d), was given the exclusive right, as a licensed importing distributor, to distribute All Brand\u2019s products in Westmoreland, Greene, Washington and Fayette Counties in their entirety, and in a portion of Allegheny County. On sixteen different occasions in 1985, McKeesport sold All Brand\u2019s products outside the geographical area for which McKeesport had been given exclusive distributing rights. This conduct was a violation of the agreement between the parties and constituted illegal conduct under the Liquor Code, 47 P.S. \u00a7 4-431(b), for which violation McKeesport was cited and fined. Commonwealth, Pennsylvania Li quor Control Board v. McKeesport Beer Distributor, Inc., 120 Pa.Commw. 554, 549 A.2d 256 (1988).\nBy letters dated October 7, 1985, and November 6, 1985, All Brand informed McKeesport that it intended to terminate McKeesport\u2019s distribution rights for All Brand\u2019s products. The November 6 letter was sent by certified mail and notified McKeesport that its distributing rights agreement would be terminated for good cause within ninety days, on the basis of McKeesport\u2019s Liquor Code violations. On January 30, 1986, McKeesport filed an action in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, seeking to enjoin the termination of its distributing rights under its agreement with All Brand. Following a hearing in the matter, McKeesport\u2019s request for injunctive relief was denied. McKeesport filed an appeal to the Superior Court which reversed and remanded for further proceedings. McKeesport Beer Distributors, Inc. v. All Brand Importers, Inc., 390 Pa.Super. 627, 569 A.2d 951 (1990). We granted All Brand\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal to this Court, and we now reverse.\nSuperior Court determined that the violations of the Liquor Code committed by McKeesport constituted good cause for termination of its distributing rights agreement with All Brand. In spite of its finding of good cause to terminate, Superior Court further determined that All Brand was not entitled to terminate the distributing rights agreement with McKeesport in that McKeesport had, within ninety days of the notice it received by certified mail, rectified its office practices to preclude any further sales of All Brand\u2019s products outside the geographical area that was the subject of the distributing rights agreement between the parties.\nAll Brand challenges this adverse determination which was based upon Superior Court\u2019s interpretation of section 4-492(19) of the Liquor Code. 47 P.S. \u00a7 4-492(19). Section 4-492(19) provides, in relevant part:\nModifying or terminating distributing rights agreement [It shall be unlawful] ...\nFor any manufacturer ... to ... terminate, ... without good cause, any distributing rights agreement, and in no event shall any ... termination ... of any distributing rights agreement become effective for at least ninety (90) days after written notice of such ... termination ... has been served on the affected party and board by certified mail____ The notice shall state all the reasons for the intended ... termination____ The distributor or importing distributor holding such agreement shall have ninety (90) days in which to rectify any claimed deficiency, or challenge the alleged cause.\nIf the deficiency shall be rectified within ninety (90) days of notice, then the proposed ... termination ... shall be null and void and without legal effect.\n47 P.S. \u00a7 4-492(19) (emphasis added).\nSuperior Court opined that this section permits an importing distributor to rectify claimed deficiencies and the conduct that constitutes good cause for termination within ninety days to avoid termination of a distributing rights agreement. All Brand argues that the Legislature\u2019s use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d regarding an importing distributor\u2019s options when faced with a termination notice must be interpreted as permitting rectification of a claimed deficiency or challenge of the alleged cause, but not rectification of both a claimed deficiency and alleged cause. Thus, All Brand urges this Court to find that the only remedy McKeesport had when faced with a notice of termination for good cause was to \u201cchallenge the alleged cause\u201d within ninety days. Because McKeesport admitted that it had sold All Brand\u2019s products outside its assigned geographical area and, thus, did not challenge the cause alleged by All Brand, All Brand argues that it is entitled to terminate its distributing rights agreement with McKeesport. We agree.\nClearly, the Legislature was setting forth two classes of conduct in utilizing the distinct terms \u201cdeficiency\u201d and \u201cgood cause\u201d in section 4-492(19) of the Liquor Code. \u201cDeficiency\u201d is not defined in the Liquor Code; in common usage and understanding, however, a deficiency is something that is insufficient or lacking in some respect. Under the plain language of section 4-492(19) of the Liquor Code, a deficiency is conduct or a condition that can be rectified. \u201cGood cause\u201d is defined in the Liquor Code as:\nthe failure by any party to an agreement, without reasonable excuse or justification, to comply substantially with an essential, reasonable and commercially acceptable requirement imposed by the other party under the terms of an agreement.\n47 P.S. \u00a7 4-431(d)(l) (emphasis added). In essence, good cause, as a \u201cfailure ... to comply,\u201d is an unrectified or an unrectifiable deficiency involving an \u201cessential, reasonable and commercially acceptable requirement ... under the terms of an agreement.\u201d Id.\nMcKeesport\u2019s violation of the Liquor Code, which violation constituted a failure to comply with the only requirement imposed by All Brand under the terms of the parties\u2019 distributing rights agreement, exposed All Brand to confiscation of its products, fines of up to $10,000, and a prohibition upon the importation of All Brand\u2019s products into this Commonwealth for a period of up to three years. 47 P.S. \u00a7 4-444. Unlike such rectifiable deficiencies as inadequate warehousing, insufficient advertising and sales, tardy deliveries or rude salespersons, McKeesport\u2019s violation of the Liquor Code could not be rectified by any subsequent action on the part of McKeesport to prevent further sales of All Brand\u2019s products outside McKeesport\u2019s exclusive geographical area of distribution. Once the Liquor Code violations had occurred, All Brand could not shield itself from the imposition of penalties by promising that its importing distributor would not violate the Liquor Code again.\nAll Brand had good cause to terminate its distributing rights agreement with McKeesport. The Liquor Code does not give an importing distributor the opportunity to \u201crectify\u201d alleged cause. As McKeesport did not challenge the alleged cause, All Brand is entitled to terminate the agreement between the parties. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court which reversed the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County denying McKeesport\u2019s request for injunctive relief.\n. As an entity that has the contractual right to distribute malt beverages and that enters into agreements with licensed importing distributors, All Brand is a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d under the Liquor Code. 47 P.S. \u00a7 4-431(b)(3).\n. Section 4-431 provides, in relevant part:\nEach out of State manufacturer of malt or brewed beverages whose products are sold and delivered in this Commonwealth shall give distributing rights for such products in designated geographical areas to specific importing distributors, and such importing distributor shall not sell or deliver malt or brewed beverages manufactured by the out of State manufacturer to any person issued a license under the provisions of this act whose licensed premises are not located within the geographical area for which he has been given distributing rights by such manufacturer.\n47 P.S. \u00a7 4 \u2014 431(b).\n. It should be noted, in this regard, that McKeesport made the final, illegal, sixteenth sale outside its designated geographical area on December 14, 1985, which was approximately one month following receipt of the notice of termination."}
