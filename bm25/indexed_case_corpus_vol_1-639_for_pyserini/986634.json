{"id": "986634", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe only assignment of error on this appeal is that the court erred in refusing to grant a new trial. This concedes that the case was for the jury, and, with no assignment complaining of any ruling of the trial judge, or of his charge to the jury, we can do nothing but dismiss the appeal.\nJudgment affirmed."}
