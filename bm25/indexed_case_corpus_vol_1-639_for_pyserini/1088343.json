{"id": "1088343", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis is an appeal from an order granting a new trial. Since the record does not demonstrate clear error of law or abuse of discretion on the part of the court below in making the order assigned as error, the assignment must be overruled: Class & Nachod Brewing Co. v. Giacobello, 277 Pa. 530; Republic Mortgage Co. v. Irwin et al., 278 Pa. 124; Babbitt v. Jackson, 279 Pa. 480.\nThe order appealed from is affirmed."}
