That means that they must be general, and the uniformity which is discussed in the decisions is not a necessary requirement but only a test of the generality which the constitution commands:\u201d Com. v. Moir, 199 Pa. 534 (552).\n\"With this addition which the course of argument seems to make desirable the judgment is affirmed on the opinion of the learned president of the Superior Court."}
