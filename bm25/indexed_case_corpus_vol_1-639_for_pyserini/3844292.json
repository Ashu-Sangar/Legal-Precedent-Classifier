{"id": "3844292", "contents": "OPINION\nChief Justice CAPPY.\nThe question presented in this appeal is the proper interpretation of the perjury statute, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4902, in a case .involving multiple falsehoods made by the same witness during a single judicial proceeding. The Superior Court concluded that the trial court erred by failing to conduct an individualized analysis of the alleged perjurious statements. Accordingly, the court vacated the judgment of sentence. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the order of the Superior Court albeit on different grounds.\nThe facts underlying the instant matter are straightforward. In 1994, Appellee Duane King entered a negotiated plea of guilty to third-degree murder, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(c), robbery, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701, and conspiracy, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903, in connection with the 1993 murder of Darryl Crawford. As part of the plea agreement, Appellee agreed to testify against his co-defendants, Kyle Dickerson and Shawn Harris. Appellee testified at his co-defendants\u2019 joint trial in 1996 and both men were convicted of second-degree murder. During Appellee\u2019s plea sentencing, the prosecutor made no recommendation as to the term of his sentence, but noted that Appellee\u2019s testimony had resulted in the conviction of his co-defendants. The court sentenced Appellee to five and one-half to thirty years in prison for his role in the murder.\nAfter serving his minimum sentence, Appellee was denied parole. On June 7, 2000, Appellee filed a PCRA petition in which he indicated that his testimony at his co-defendants\u2019 trial was false. On March 12, 2001, Appellee signed an affidavit in which he swore that his trial testimony against Dickerson was false. Dickerson, in turn, attached Appellee\u2019s affidavit in support of his own PCRA petition, claiming after-discovered evidence, and called Appellee as a witness at his PCRA evidentiary hearing on July 12, 2002. Under oath, Appellee recanted his sworn testimony from the 1996 trial.\nIn addition to testifying that he had lied at the 1996 trial, Appellee tried to explain his prior testimony by claiming that he had been coerced into lying by the police and the prosecution. To bolster his claim of coercion, Appellee made six specific factual representations, which the Commonwealth later used in charging Appellee with six separate counts of perjury. The six alleged perjurious statements made during Dickerson\u2019s PCRA hearing were as follows: 1) Appellee claimed that he was arrested before, not after, providing a statement to the police detectives; 2) Appellee claimed that the detectives told him to falsely accuse Ivan Bingham in Crawford\u2019s murder; 3) Appellee claimed that the detectives told him that they would lift an open charge of murder against him in exchange for his false accusation against Ivan Bingham; 4) Appellee claimed that the detectives told him to falsely implicate himself in the Crawford murder (in order to bolster his testimony regarding Bingham); 5) Appellee claimed that the detectives promised him that he would receive no more than five years in prison for the Crawford murder; and 6) Appellee claimed that Assistant District Attorney Fisk told him that she would dispose of his open homicide case and limit his sentence on the Crawford murder to five years in prison. In response, the Commonwealth presented evidence that each of these claims was false, as was Appellee\u2019s overall recantation testimony. The Dickerson PCRA court rejected Appellee\u2019s recantation testimony and denied Dickerson\u2019s request for PCRA relief.\nFollowing Dickerson\u2019s PCRA hearing, the police arrested Appellee and charged him with perjury and false swearing, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4903. After a jury trial, Appellee was convicted of one count of false swearing and six counts of perjury \u2014 one count for each of the six falsehoods related previously. The trial court sentenced Appellee to three to six years on each perjury conviction ordered to run consecutively, resulting in an aggregate term of eighteen to thirty-six years in prison.\nAppellee filed an appeal and the trial court filed an opinion in support of its sentence. Regarding Appellee\u2019s claim that the evidence did not support six separate counts of perjury, the trial court explained that the statements were material to the proceeding in which they were made because they cast doubt on the credibility of the police and the district attorney\u2019s office.\nThe Superior Court vacated the judgment of sentence in a memorandum opinion. Relevant to the instant appeal, the court explained that the Commonwealth was required to show that each of the six statements \u201cthat it parsed out of the PCRA transcript, could have, standing alone, affected the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d Superior Court slip opinion, 3/8/2005, at 5. The trial court failed to provide such an individualized analysis of the alleged perjurious statements and the Commonwealth \u201cessentially concede[d] that the six independent statements had only incremental value.\u201d Id. at 6. Accordingly, the court concluded that the record only supported a single count of perjury when the six falsehoods were considered in the unified context in which they were given.\nJudge Olszewski filed a concurring and dissenting opinion, noting that he would uphold all six of Appellee\u2019s perjury convictions. The proper inquiry concerning the materiality of a false statement, according to Judge Olszewski, was whether the statement had the ability to affect the fact finder and the outcome of the proceeding, not whether the statement actually influences the result of the proceeding.\nThe Commonwealth appealed the Superior Court\u2019s order and this court granted allowance of appeal to explore the materiality requirement in the perjury statute.\nPreliminary, this matter involves a question of interpretation of the perjury statute. As such it is a question of law. Our scope of review is plenary, and our standard of review is de novo. Freundt, v. Penn. DOT, 584 Pa. 283, 883 A.2d 503, 506 (2005).\nThe Statutory Construction Act guides us in our inquiry and instructs us, in relevant part that, \u201cthe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly, and \u2018[wjhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u2019 \u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921. A court should resort to other considerations, such as the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in enacting a statute, only when the words of a statute are ambiguous. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921 (c).\nThe Act also provides that \u201c[wjords and phrases shall be construed according to the rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage\u201d; and that \u201ctechnical words and phrases and such others as have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning ... shall be construed according to such peculiar and appropriate meaning or definition.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a). Further, if the General Assembly defines words that are used in a statute, those definitions are binding. Commonwealth v. Kimmel, 523 Pa. 107, 565 A.2d 426, 428 (1989). Finally, because we are construing a criminal statute, we must keep in mind that penal provisions are to be strictly construed. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928.\nThe crime of perjury is statutorily defined as follows:\n(a) Offense defined. \u2014 A person is guilty of perjury, a felony of the third degree, if in any official proceeding he makes a false statement under oath or equivalent affirmation, or swears or affirms the truth of a statement previously made, when the statement is material and he does not believe it to be true.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4902(a). The Legislature has defined \u201cstatement\u201d for purposes of perjury as follows:\nAs used in this chapter, unless a different meaning plainly is required, \u201cstatement\u201d means any representation, but includes a representation of opinion, belief or other state of mind only if the representation clearly relates to state of mind apart from or in addition to any facts which are the subject of the representation.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4901. Last, the materiality requirement of the crime is statutorily defined under section 4902 as:\n(b) Materiality. \u2014 Falsification is material, regardless of the admissibility of the statement under rules of evidence, if it\ncould have affected the course or outcome of the proceeding. It is no defense that the declarant mistakenly believed the falsification to be immaterial. Whether a falsification is material in a given factual situation is a question of law.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4902(b).\nTaken together, these provisions make clear that in order to constitute the offense of perjury, there must be a false statement, i.e., a representation, which could have affected the course or outcome of the proceeding. In this case, the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the case was that each individual falsehood was a separate statement justifying a separate count of perjury. Thus, the Commonwealth had to prove three items \u2014 the individual falsehood was a statement, that statement by itself \u201ccould have affected the course or outcome of the proceeding,\u201d and that Appellee did not believe the statement to be true. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4902(b). There is no contention regarding Appellee\u2019s belief of the falsity of the statements and this court\u2019s focus is on the remaining two requirements.\nTurning first to the definition of \u201cstatement,\u201d Section 4901 is clear that while a statement may be comprised of a single fact, it may also be comprised of many facts, which amount to a single representation. In the context of the instant matter, however, we must consider whether multiple, separate falsehoods amount to a single or multiple statements. In Commonwealth v. Davenport, 255 Pa.Super. 131, 386 A.2d 543 (1978), the Superior Court had occasion to examine a comparable question. In Davenport, the defendant had made similar statements at two different proceedings, and the Commonwealth charged the defendant with two separate counts of perjury. While the situation was not identical to the case at hand, the court\u2019s discussion provides some guidance for the instant matter. The court noted, \u201cthe use of the phrase \u2018facts which are the subject of the representation\u2019 makes clear that the legislature had in mind that a \u2018representation\u2019 may comprise more than one fact.\u201d Id. at 550. The court then pointed out that the essential question was whether the \u201crepresentations\u201d described one event or were so inter-related as to a single subject matter to constitute a single \u201cstatement.\u201d In support, the Davenport court quoted a portion of State v. Anderson, 35 Utah 496, 101 P. 385 (1909), a case that addressed when multiple false facts are so interrelated that they constitute only one count: \u201c[T]he several assignments contained in the information consist of certain alleged successive statements made by defendant while testifying as a witness, and are so related to the one question which was the subject-matter of inquiry ... and were so linked and blended together in point of time, as to constitute but one act or transaction, and therefore constitute but one offense.\u201d Davenport, 386 A.2d at 550 (quoting Anderson, 101 P. at 387). Similarly, American Jurisprudence informs us \u201c[s]tatements related to different matters may be made the basis of separate counts of perjury, even though they all refer to the same general subject of inquiry and were made at the same hearing.\u201d 60A Am.Jur.2d Perjury \u00a7 53.\nTherefore, we must conclude that the essential inquiry in determining whether each individual falsehood could be considered an individual \u201cstatement\u201d must be whether each lie related to \u201cdifferent matters\u201d or a single event or were so interrelated as to a single subject matter that they could not amount to individual statements for purposes of Section 4902.\nSuch an inquiry, however, is only half the question, as the Commonwealth must also establish that the individual falsehoods were material. As noted previously, the Legislature has defined materiality as a statement that \u201ccould have affected the course or outcome of the proceedings.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4902(b). The word \u201ccould\u201d is the past tense of \u201ccan.\u201d \u201cCan\u201d is \u201cused to indicate possibility or probability.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary, 2d College ed., 232 (1981). Moreover, the plain language of Section 4902(b) is clear and the statement need not affect the \u201coutcome\u201d of the proceedings, so long as it \u201ccould\u201d have affected the \u201ccourse\u201d of the proceedings.\nFurther illustration of materiality, for purposes of applying the concept, can be found in Kungys v. United States, 485 U.S. 759, 769, 108 S.Ct. 1537, 99 L.Ed.2d 839 (1988). In Kungys, the Court explained that the term \u201cmaterial\u201d in the context of perjury was not a \u201chapax legomenon,\u201d but had a long history of use. \u201cBlackstone used the same term, writing that in order to constitute \u2018the crime of willful and corrupt perjury\u2019 the false statement \u2018must be in some point material to the question in dispute; for if it only be in some trifling collateral circumstance, to which no regard is paid,\u2019 it is not punishable.\u201d Id. at 769, 108 S.Ct. 1537 (emphasis in the original). After reviewing the historical concept of materiality and relevant case law, the Court concluded that the central object of the \u201cmateriality\u201d inquiry was \u201cwhether the misrepresentation or concealment was predictably capable of affecting, i.e., had a natural tendency to affect, the official decision.\u201d Id. at 771, 108 S.Ct. 1537. Stated differently, the \u201ctest is not whether the false statement actually influenced the relevant decision-making body, or whether the outcome of the proceedings in which the statement was uttered would have been different ... but whether the false testimony was capable of influencing or misleading the tribunal on the issue before it.\u201d 60 Am.Jur.2d Perjury \u00a7 28 (emphasis added). Moreover, the false statement need not be material to the main issue, so long as it \u201chas a legitimate tendency to prove or disprove some fact that is material, irrespective of the main fact at issue. Thus, a statement will generally support a charge of perjury if it is material to any proper matter of inquiry and it is calculated and intended to bolster the testimony of a witness on some material point or attack the credibility of the witness.\u201d 60 Am.Jur.2d Perjury \u00a7 28.\nWith these concepts in mind, we turn to an examination of the six falsehoods presented in this case. As stated previously, under the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the case, each individual falsehood had to be a \u201cstatement\u201d which \u201ccould have\u201d altered the course or outcome of the Dickerson PCRA court proceedings in order for the Commonwealth to proceed on six separate counts of perjury.\nThere can be no question that the six separate falsehoods related to the same general subject matter, i.e., that Appellee\u2019s testimony before the trial court in his co-defendant\u2019s case was false and a result of a scheme set-up by the police and the District Attorney\u2019s office. Nevertheless, as explained previously, this fact does not prevent the separate lies from being treated as distinct statements. Rather, in determining whether they comprised six separate statements, the question is whether the individual statements related to \u201cdifferent matters\u201d or a single event or were so interrelated as to a single subject matter that they could not amount to individual statements for purposes of Section 4902.\nApplying this concept, we acknowledge that the six separate lies arguably related to three \u201cdifferent matters\u201d as one of them concerned the timing of Appellee\u2019s arrest, four of them related to Appellee\u2019s interaction with the police, and the sixth statement related to Appellee\u2019s dealings with the District Attorney. Therefore, there would be support for treating the falsehoods as three separate \u201cstatements.\u201d\nUnder the perjury statute, however, each \u201cstatement\u201d must also have had the possibility or probability of altering the course or outcome of the PCRA court\u2019s proceedings. This does not mean that the statement must have actually changed the course or outcome of the proceedings. Rather, it is sufficient if the statement had a natural tendency to affect the course or outcome of the proceedings. Kungys supra. And, in this case, it is this requirement that we hold the Commonwealth did not establish.\nThe individual falsehoods were so interrelated that it could not be demonstrated that each one individually had any effect on the course of outcome of the PCRA court\u2019s proceedings, much less a possible or probable effect. For example, Appellee\u2019s testimony that he was arrested before, and not after, he gave the statement to the police was not possible or probable of influencing the course or outcome of the proceedings. Rather, it was only when considered together with the lies that followed that the import of the statement was clear. Similarly, Appellee\u2019s claim that the detectives told him to implicate himself falsely in the Crawford murder was only material within the framework of the two previous lies regarding the fact that the detectives wanted Appellee to implicate Ivan Bingham in the Crawford murder \u2014 the false implication was meant to bolster Appellee\u2019s credibility in implicating Bingham, but the lie had no possibility or probability of influencing the decision-maker on its own. Finally, Appellee\u2019s claim regarding the promises made by Assistant District Attorney Fisk were only material when considered in context of the remaining lies \u2014 why would ADA Fisk promise Appellee anything if she received nothing in return? The obvious answer is that she was promised Appellee\u2019s testimony against Ivan Bingham, an answer that can be made only when looking at the previous four lies. In short, each individual falsehood, considered alone, was merely a \u201ctrifling collateral circumstance\u201d that could not have affected the course or outcome of the proceedings when considered alone. Rather, the statements had such probable or possible effect only when considered together. For this reason, we affirm the order of the Superior Court vacating the trial court\u2019s sentence.\nJustices BAER, BALDWIN and Justice FITZGERALD join the opinion.\nJustice CASTILLE files a dissenting opinion in which Justice SAYLOR joins.\nJustice EAKIN files a dissenting opinion.\nThis matter was reassigned to this Justice.\n. In his Brief to (his court, Appellee states that his PCRA petition was summarily denied without a hearing.\n. Appellee raises the question of whether the Superior Court granted the proper remedy, since it affirmed the conviction of count one, but reversed the remaining counts. Appellee points out that none of the counts met the materiality requirement, and therefore, Appellee could not have been convicted of perjury at all. We disagree with Appellee, since we find that the statements considered together clearly established a single count of perjury. Accordingly, we affirm the Order of the Superior Court remanding the matter for imposition of a sentence based upon a single count of perjury."}
