{"id": "854193", "contents": "SECURITY COMPANY\u2019S APPEAL.\nOpinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nAll the material facts of this case sufficiently appear in the record of the court below, and hence special reference to them is unnecessary.\nThe question whether the fund for distribution is to be regarded as real or personal estate is answered by application of the principle of Wentz\u2019s Appeal, 126 Pa. 541, and cases there cited. It was in fact and in law personalty when the owner died, and is distributable as such.\nWhile the general r\u00fale requires that the surplusage of personal estate shall be remitted from the ancillary to the domiciliary jurisdiction for distribution, Barry\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 131, there is a well recognized exception, which grew out of the duty of every government to protect its own citizens, where there are parties entitled to share in such property claiming distribution in the ancillary jurisdiction, and no domiciliary creditors. In such case, the court will not send the parties, to seek their rights at great and unnecessary expense and delay, to a foreign tribunal; but will make distribution in accordance with the law of the domicil; and the situs rei, the presence of the parties and the principles of justice, public law, and international policy, sustain its assumption of jurisdiction: Dent\u2019s Appeal, 22 Pa. 514; 2 Kent\u2019s Com. 433. There are admittedly no domiciliary creditors of this decedent.\nBut is there a resident claimant entitled to share in the fund for distribution ? The proviso to the Connecticut intestate law declares that in cases like the present, \u201c the estate shall be distributed equally to the next of kin to the intestate of the blood of the person or ancestor from whom such estate came or descended,\u201d and that \u201c in ascertaining the next of kin in all cases the rule of the civil law shall be adopted.\u201d Half of the present \u201c estate,\u201d having been derived through decedent\u2019s mother, was properly awarded to appellee, and the other half, having been derived through decedent\u2019s brother, to appellant under that rule.\nThe appellant insisted that the proviso to said intestate law \u25a0was only applicable to real estate, and consequently not to this fund; but it was authoritatively settled in Clark\u2019s Appeal, 58 Conn. 207, that it embraced both real and personal estate. \u201c The purpose of the proviso,\u201d said the court, \u201c manifestly is to take the ancestral estate of a certain class of intestates out of the operation of the statute and to give to that estate, whether it be real, or real and personal estate which is referred to, a different direction from that it would take but for the proviso.\u201d\nSo it was urged that the sale of the real estate which Hubert G. Welles had inherited destroyed the ancestral character of the estate, and that it must take from that fact a new direction. But the obvious answer to this is that the statute by its terms operates on the \u201c estate,\u201d and form is therefore immaterial. No matter through how many transmutations it may pass, so long as it can be identified it is still an \u201c ancestral estate.\u201d The substance remains although the form is changed and is within both the letter and spirit of the statute.\nThe cases of Terry\u2019s Appeal, 28 Conn. 339, and Bristol v. Austin, 40 Conn. 438, cited for appellant, have no application to the facts of this case.\nIt follows from what has been said that there is no error in the decree.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellant.\nCAROLINE H. STEINMAN\u2019S APPEAL.\nOpinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nApril 23, 1894:\nThe questions involved in this appeal grew out of substantially the same state of facts as was presented in Security Company\u2019s Appeal, same estate, No. 301, January T., 1894, and have been sufficiently considered in opinion just filed in that case. For reasons there given the decree should be affirmed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant."}
