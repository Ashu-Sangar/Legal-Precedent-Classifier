{"id": "1181336", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe minor plaintiff, 12 years of age, was injured while playing on the fire escape of one of the schools maintained by appellee. It appears the child tripped over a pile of books placed on the steps by other pupils during recess. Appellants contended that permitting the children to place books on tbe fire escape as a daily babit and to use it for play, constituted a nuisance which tbe school district negligently permitted to exist.\nTbe court below properly concluded that tbe condition described by appellants\u2019 witnesses did not constitute a nuisance. At most, tbe agents and servants of tbe school district were negligent in permitting tbe pupils to do tbe things related, and it is well settled that a school district is not liable for tbe ordinary negligence of its employees: Carlo v. Scranton School District, 319 Pa. 417.\nJudgment affirmed."}
