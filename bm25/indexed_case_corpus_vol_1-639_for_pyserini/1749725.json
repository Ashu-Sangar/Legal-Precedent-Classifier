{"id": "1749725", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant, the law firm of Adler, Barish, Daniels, Levin and Creskoff, filed a Complaint in Equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. It sought to enjoin appellees, former associates of Adler Barish, from interfering with existing contractual relationships between Adler Barish and its clients. The court of common pleas entered a final decree granting the requested relief, but a divided Superior Court dissolved the injunction and dismissed Adler Barish\u2019s complaint. We granted allowance of appeal. We now reverse and direct reinstatement of the decree of the court of common pleas.\nI. Background\nFrom the formation of Adler Barish in February, 1976, through March of the next year, appellees were salaried associates of Adler Barish. Appellees were under the supervision of Adler Barish partners, who directed appellees\u2019 work on cases which clients brought to the firm.\nWhile still working for Adler Barish, appellees decided to form their own law firm and took several steps toward achieving their goal. They retained counsel to advise them concerning their business venture, sought and found office space, and early in March, 1977, signed a lease.\nShortly before leaving Adler Barish, appellees procured a line of $150,000 from First Pennsylvania Bank. As security, appellees furnished bank officials with a list of eighty-eight cases and their anticipated legal fees, several of which were higher than $25,000, and together exceeded $500,000. No case on the list, however, was appellees\u2019. Rather, each case was an Adler Barish case on which appellees were working.\nAppellee Alan Epstein\u2019s employment relationship with Adler Barish terminated on March 10, 1977. At his request, Epstein continued to use offices of Adler Barish until March 19. During this time, and through April 4, when Adler Barish filed its complaint, Epstein was engaged in an active campaign to procure business for his new law firm. He initiated contacts, by phone and in person, with clients of Adler Barish with open cases on which he had worked while a salaried employee. Epstein advised the Adler Barish clients that he was leaving the firm and that they could choose to be represented by him, Adler Barish, or any other firm or attorney.\nEpstein\u2019s attempt to procure business on behalf of the firm did not stop with these contacts. He mailed to the clients form letters which could be used to discharge Adler Barish as counsel, name Epstein the client\u2019s new counsel and create a contingent fee agreement. Epstein also provided clients with a stamped envelope addressed to Epstein. Appellees Richard Weisbord, Arnold Wolf, and Sanford Jablon, who left Adler Barish on April 1, 1977, were aware of Epstein\u2019s efforts to procure this business on behalf of their new firm and did not attempt to curtail them. Indeed, Weisbord and Wolf, upon leaving Adler Barish, also immediately began to seek business, as did Epstein, for the new firm. They too informed clients of Adler Barish of their plans and that the clients were free to discharge Adler Barish and retain Weisbord and Wolf in its stead. Their efforts continued until Adler Barish filed its complaint.\nThus, clients of Adler Barish served a dual purpose in appellees\u2019 effort to start their own law firm. First, while appellees still worked for Adler Barish, Adler Barish cases formed the basis for appellees\u2019 obtaining bank credit. Then, appellees, as they left Adler Barish, made a concentrated attempt to procure the cases which had been used to obtain credit.\nOn April 4, the court of common pleas granted Adler Barish preliminary relief, enjoining appellees\u2019 campaign to obtain the business of Adler Barish clients. One month later, on May 5, the court entered its final decree, which provided:\n\u201c[T]he defendants, ALAN B. EPSTEIN, RICHARD A. WEISBORD, ARNOLD J. WOLF and SANFORD I. JAB-LON, and all persons acting in concert with them or otherwise participating with them or acting in their aid or behalf, are permanently enjoined and restrained from contacting and/or communicating with those persons who up to and including April 1, 1977, had active legal matters pending with and were represented by the law firm of ADLER, BARISH, DANIELS, LEVIN and CRESKOFF, except that:\n1. Nothing in this Final Decree shall be construed to preclude the defendants from announcing the formation of their new professional relationship in accordance with the requirements of DR 2-102 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.\n2. Nothing in this Final Decree shall preclude those persons who, up to and including April 1, 1977, had active legal matters pending with and had been represented by the law firm of ADLER, BARISH, DANIELS, LEVIN and CRESKOFF from voluntarily discharging their present attorney and selecting any of the defendants, or any other attorney, to represent them.\u201d\nThe court concluded that appellees \u201cengaged in illegal solicitation in complete and total disregard for the Code of Professional Responsibility\u201d and thereby \u201ctortiously interfered with the contractual and business relations that exist between Adler Barish and its clients.\u201d It found equitable relief appropriate in view of appellees\u2019 \u201cavowed intentions . to continue their illegal solicitation.\u201d\nAppellees appealed to the Superior Court, which reversed. In addition to granting Adler Barish\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal, we granted a stay and expedited argument.\nII. Appellees\u2019 Constitutional Claim\nThe facts found by the court of common pleas, which appellees do not dispute and the Superior Court did not disturb, demonstrate that, while leaving Adler Barish, appellees made numerous contacts with Adler Barish clients on whose active cases appellees were working before leaving Adler Barish. Adler Barish argues that appellees\u2019 conduct constitutes an intentional interference with existing contractual relationships between Adler Barish and its clients. According to Adler Barish, appellees\u2019 conduct is \u201cdeserving of censure, not encouragement.\u201d Appellees\u2019 on the other hand, contend that their conduct was \u201cprivileged,\u201d and that therefore no right of action for intentional interference lies. Moreover, they argue that their conduct is protected under the first and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n\u201c[S]peech which does \u2018no more than propose a commercial transaction\u2019 \u201d is no longer outside the protection of the first and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 762, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 1825, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976) (striking down state statute deeming licensed pharmacists\u2019 advertising of prescription drugs \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d); see Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy v. Pastor, 441 Pa. 186, 272 A.2d 487 (1971) (invalidating Pennsylvania statute prohibiting advertising of \u201cdangerous drugs\u201d dispensible only with a physician\u2019s prescription). Accordingly, states are barred from imposing blanket prohibitions against truthful advertising of \u201croutine\u201d legal services. Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977). Such a blanket prohibition \u201cserves to inhibit the free flow of commercial information and to keep the public in ignorance.\u201d Id., 433 U.S. at 365, 97 S.Ct. at 2700.\nNothing in the challenged decree prohibited appellees from engaging in the truthful advertising protected under Bates. Appellees could inform the general public, including clients of Adler Barish, of the availability of their legal services, and thus the \u201cfree flow of commercial information\u201d to the public is unimpaired. Moreover, the injunction expressly permitted appellees to announce \u201cformation of their new professional relationship in accordance with the requirements of DR 2-102 of the Code of Professional Responsibility.\u201d Appellees therefore were permitted to mail announcements to \u201clawyers, clients, former clients, personal friends, and relatives.\u201d Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 2-102(A)(2). This would include the very clients of Adler Barish whose business appellees sought. See Committee on Professional Ethics of the American Bar Association, Informal Decision No. 681 (August 1,1963) (permitting departing attorney to send announcements \u201cto those clients of the old firm for whom he had worked\u201d).\nWhat the injunction did proscribe was appellees\u2019 \u201ccontacting and/or communicating with those persons who up to and including April 1, 1977, had active legal matters pending with and were represented by the law firm of ADLER, BARISH, DANIELS, LEVIN and CRESKOFF.\u201d Our task is to decide whether the conduct of appellees is constitutionally subject to sanction.\nThe Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 2-103(A) (as adopted, 1974), provides:\n\u201cA lawyer shall not recommend employment, as a private practitioner, of himself, his partner, or associate to a non-lawyer who has not sought his advice regarding employment of a lawyer.\u201d\nSee also Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 2-104(A). Appellees clearly violated this \u201cproscription against self-recommendation.\u201d Berlant Appeal, 458 Pa. 439, 443, 328 A.2d 471, 474 (1974), cert. denied, 421 U.S. 964, 95 S.Ct. 1953, 44 L.Ed.2d 451 (1975). They recommended their own employment, even though clients of Adler Barish did not seek appellees\u2019 advice \u201cregarding employment of a lawyer.\u201d\nOhralik v. Ohio State Bar Association, 436 U.S. 447, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978), makes plain that, after Bates, states may constitutionally impose sanctions upon attorneys engaging in conduct which violates these disciplinary rules, even though the conduct involves \u201ccommercial speech.\u201d In Ohralik, the state bar association suspended an attorney who \u201csolicited\u201d persons injured in an automobile accident by making visits to the hospital room where the persons were recovering. Mr. Justice Powell, speaking for the Court, emphasized that commercial speech does not enjoy the same constitutional protections traditionally afforded other forms of speech:\n\u201cIn rejecting the notion that such speech \u2018is wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment,\u2019 Virginia Pharmacy, 425 U.S., at 761, 96 S.Ct. at 1825, we were careful not to hold \u2018that it is wholly undifferentiable from other forms\u2019 of speech. Id., at 771 n.24, 96 S.Ct. at 1830. We have not discarded the \u2018commonsense\u2019 distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech. Ibid. To require a parity of constitutional protection for commercial and noncommercial speech alike could invite dilution, simply by a leveling process, of the force of the Amendment\u2019s guarantee with respect to the latter kind of speech. Rather than subject the First Amendment to such a devitalization, we instead have afforded commercial speech a limited measure of protection, commensurate with its subordinate position in the scale of First Amendment values, while allowing modes of regulation that might be impermissible in the realm of noncommercial expression.\n\u201cNumerous examples could be cited of communications that are regulated without offending the First Amendment, such as the exchange of information about securities, SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 883 (CA2 1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 976, 89 S.Ct. 1454, 22 L.Ed.2d 756 (1969), corporate proxy statements, Mills v. Electric Auto-Lite Co., 396 U.S. 375, 90 S.Ct. 616, 24 L.Ed.2d 593 (1970), the exchange of price and production information among competitors, American Column & Lumber Co. v. United States, 257 U.S. 377, 42 S.Ct. 114, 66 L.Ed. 284 (1921), and employers\u2019 threats of retaliation for the labor activities of employees, NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1942, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969). See Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49, 61-62, 93 S.Ct. 2628, 2637, 37 L.Ed.2d 446 (1973). Each of these examples illustrates that the State does not lose its power to regulate commercial activity deemed harmful to the public whenever speech is a component of that activity. Neither Virginia Pharmacy nor Bates purported to cast doubt on the permissibility of these kinds of commercial regulation.\u201d\nId., 436 U.S. at 455-456, 98 S.Ct. at 1918-19 (footnote omitted). In rejecting the attorney\u2019s constitutional claim, the Court determined that the state\u2019s interests were important enough to support regulation of the attorney\u2019s conduct:\n\u201cAs applied in this case, the disciplinary rules are said to have limited the communication of two kinds of information. First, appellant\u2019s solicitation imparted to Carol McClintock and Wanda Lou Holbert certain information about his availability and the terms of his proposed legal services. In this respect, in-person solicitation serves much the same function as the advertisement at issue in Bates. But there are significant differences as well. Unlike a public advertisement, which simply provides information and leaves the recipient free to act upon it or not, in-person solicitation may exert pressure and often demands an immediate response, without providing an opportunity for comparison or reflection. The aim and effect of in-person solicitation may be to provide a one-sided presentation and to encourage speedy and perhaps uninformed decisionmaking; there is no opportunity for intervention or counter-education by agencies of the Bar, supervisory authorities, or persons close to the solicited individual. The admonition that \u2018the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones\u2019 is of little value when the circumstances provide no opportunity for any remedy at all. In-person solicitation is as likely as not to discourage persons needing counsel from engaging in a critical comparison of the \u2018availability, nature, and prices\u2019 of legal services, cf. Bates, supra, 433 U.S. at 364, 97 S.Ct. at 2699, it actually may disserve the individual and societal interest, identified in Bates, in facilitating \u2018informed and reliable decisionmaking.\u2019 Ibid.\u201d\nId., 436 U.S. at 457, 98 S.Ct. at 1919 (footnotes omitted).\nJust as in Ohralik, appellees\u2019 conduct frustrates, rather than advances, Adler Barish clients\u2019 \u201cinformed and reliable decisionmaking.\u201d After making Adler Barish clients expressly aware that appellees\u2019 new firm was interested in procuring their active cases, Epstein provided the clients the forms that would sever one attorney-client relationship and create another. Epstein\u2019s aim was to encourage speedy, simple action by the client. All the client needed to do was to \u201csign on the dotted line\u201d and mail the forms in the self-addressed, stamped envelopes. Other appellees condoned Epstein\u2019s conduct on behalf of appellees\u2019 new firm. Indeed, upon their departure, appellees Weisbord and Wolf informed Adler Barish clients that they could discharge Adler Barish and retain appellees.\nThus, appellees were actively attempting to induce the clients to change law firms in the middle of their active cases. Appellees\u2019 concern for their line of credit and the success of their new law firm gave them an immediate, personally created financial interest in the clients\u2019 decisions. In this atmosphere, appellees\u2019 contacts posed too great a risk that clients would not have the opportunity to make a careful, informed decision. Compare Code of Professional Responsibility, EC 2-10 (directing that standards for attorney advertising \u201cfacilitate informed selection of lawyers by potential consumers of legal services\u201d). \u201c[T]o reduce the likelihood of overreaching and the exertion of undue influence on lay persons; to protect the privacy of individuals; and to avoid situations where the lawyer\u2019s exercise of judgment on behalf of the client will be clouded by his own pecuniary self-interest,\u201d Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Association, 436 U.S. at 461, 98 S.Ct. at 1921, we must reject appellees\u2019 argument and conclude that, just as in Ohralik, the Constitution permits regulation of their conduct.\nIII. The Right of Action\nThus, we turn to whether the court of common pleas properly concluded that Adler Barish is entitled to relief. In Birl v. Philadelphia Electric Co., 402 Pa. 297, 167 A.2d 472 (1961), this Court adopted Section 766 of Restatement of Torts and its definition of the right of action for intentional interference with existing contractual relations. There, we stated:\n\u201cAt least since Lumley v. Gye (1853), 2 Ell. & Bl. 216, 1 Eng.Rul.Cas. 706, the common law has recognized an action in tort for an intentional, unprivileged interference with contractual relations. It is generally recognized that one has the right to pursue his business relations or employment free from interference on the part of other persons except where such interference is justified or constitutes an exercise of an absolute right: Restatement, Torts, \u00a7 766. The Special Note to comment m. in \u00a7 766 points out: \u2018There are frequent expressions in judicial opinions that \u201cmalice\u201d is requisite for liability in the cases treated in this Section. But the context and course of decision make it clear that what is meant is not malice in the sense of ill will but merely purposeful interference without justification.\u2019 Our cases are in accord: Klauder v. Cregar, [supra;] Dora v. Dora, [supra.]\n\u201cThe elements of this tort of inducing breach of contract or refusal to deal, which must be averred in the complaint, are set forth in the Restatement, Torts, \u00a7 766, which says, \u2018. . one who, without a privilege to do so, induces or otherwise purposely causes a third person not to (a) perform a contract with another, or (b) enter into or continue a business relation with another is liable to the other for the harm caused thereby\u2019. In other words, the actor must act (1) for the purpose of causing this specific type of harm to the plaintiff, (2) such act must be unprivileged, and (3) the harm must actually result.\u201d\n402 Pa. at 300-301, 167 A.2d at 474 (footnotes omitted).\nIn its continuing effort to provide the judicial system orderly and accurate restatements of the common law, the American Law Institute has reviewed each section of the Restatement of Torts, including Section 766. Section 766 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (Tent. Draft No. 23, 1977), states the Institute\u2019s present view of what constitutes the elements of the cause of action before us:\n\u201cIntentional Interference with Performance of Contract by Third Person\nOne who intentionally and improperly interferes with the performance of a contract (except a contract to marry) between another and a third person by inducing or otherwise causing the third person not to perform the contract, is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary loss resulting to the other from the third person\u2019s failure to perform the contract.\u201d\nThis Court constantly seeks to harmonize common law rules, principles, and doctrines with modern perceptions of societal needs and responsibilities. See e. g., Glenn v. Point Park College, 441 Pa. 474, 481, 272 A.2d 895, 899 (1971) (relying upon Tentative Draft of \u00a7 766A, Restatement (Second) of Torts (Tent. Draft No. 14, 1969), in upholding right of action for interference with prospective contract relations). Accordingly, we believe it appropriate to analyze this case in light of the approach fashioned by Restatement (Second). Accord, Augustine v. Anti-Defamation League, 75 Wis.2d 207, 249 N.W.2d 547 (1977).\nAn examination of this case in light of Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 766, reveals that the sole dispute is whether appellees\u2019 conduct is \u201cimproper.\u201d There is no doubt that appellees intentionally sought to interfere with performance of the contractual relations between Adler Barish and its clients. While still at Adler Barish, appellees\u2019 behavior, particularly their use of expected fees from Adler Barish clients\u2019 cases, indicates appellees\u2019 desire to gain a segment of the firm\u2019s business. This pattern of conduct continued until the court of common pleas enjoined it. Indeed, appellees\u2019 intentional efforts to obtain a share of Adler Barish\u2019s business were successful. The record reveals that several clients signed the forms Epstein prepared on behalf of appellees notifying Adler Barish that the clients no longer wished the services of Adler Barish. Likewise, the record reveals that Adler Barish and its clients were parties to valid, existing contracts.\nIn assessing whether appellees\u2019 conduct is \u201cimproper,\u201d we bear in mind what this Court stated in Glenn v. Point Park College, supra, 441 Pa. at 482, 272 A.2d at 899, where we analyzed \u201cprivileges\u201d in conjunction with the closely related right of action for intentional interference with prospective contract relations:\n\u201cThe absence of privilege or justification in the tort under discussion is closely related to the element of intent. As stated by Harper & James, The Law of Torts, \u00a7 6.11, at 513-14: \u2018. . . where, as in most cases, the defendant acts at least in part for the purpose of protecting some legitimate interest which conflicts with that of the plaintiff, a line must be drawn and the interests evaluated. This process results in according or denying a privilege which, in turn, determines liability.\u2019 What is or is not privileged conduct in a given situation is not susceptible of precise definition. Harper & Hames refer in general to interferences which \u2018are sanctioned by the \u201crules of the game\u201d which society has adopted\u2019, and to \u2018the area of socially acceptable conduct which the law regards as privileged,\u2019 id. at 510, 511, and treat the subject in detail in \u00a7\u00a7 6.12 and 6.13.\u201d\nWe are guided, too, by Section 767 of Restatement (Second) of Torts, which focuses on what factors should be considered in determining whether conduct is \u201cimproper:\u201d\n\u201cIn determining whether an actor\u2019s conduct in intentionally interfering with an existing contract or a prospective contractual relation of another is improper or not, consideration is given to the following factors:\n(a) The nature of the actor\u2019s conduct,\n(b) The actor\u2019s motive,\n(c) The interests of the other with which the actor\u2019s\nconduct interferes,\n(d) The interests sought to be advanced by the actor,\n(e) The proximity or remoteness of the actor\u2019s conduct to the interference and\n(f) The relations between the parties.\u201d\nWe find nothing in the \u201c \u2018rules of the game\u2019 which society has adopted\u201d which sanctions appellees\u2019 conduct. Indeed, the rules which apply to those who enjoy the privilege of practicing law in this Commonwealth expressly disapprove appellees\u2019 method of obtaining clients. Supra Part IIA, discussing Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 2-103(A). We find such a departure from \u201c[r]eeognized ethical codes\u201d \u201csignificant in evaluating the nature of [appellees\u2019] conduct.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra at \u00a7 767 comment c. All the reasons underlying our Disciplinary Rules\u2019 \u201cproscription against [appellees\u2019] self-recommendation,\u201d Berlant Appeal, supra, 458 Pa. at 443, 328 A.2d at 474, especially the concern that appellees\u2019 contacts too easily could overreach and unduly influence Adler Barish clients with active cases, are relevant here.\nAppellees\u2019 conduct adversely affected more than the informed and reliable decisionmaking of Adler Barish clients with active cases. Their conduct also had an immediate impact upon Adler Barish. Adler Barish was prepared to continue to perform services for its clients and therefore could anticipate receiving compensation for the value of its efforts. Moreover, as we concluded in Richette.v. Pennsylvania Railroad, 410 Pa. 6,187 A.2d 910 (1963), Adler Barish\u2019s fee agreements with clients were a source of anticipated revenue protected from outside interference.\nIt is true that, upon termination of their employment relationship with Adler Barish, appellees were free to engage in their own business venture. See Restatement (Second) of Agency, \u00a7 396(a) (1958) (\u201c[u]nless otherwise agreed, after termination of the agency, the agent . has no duty not to compete with the principal\u201d); Carl A. Colteryahn Dairy, Inc. v. Schneider Dairy, 415 Pa. 276, 203 A.2d 469 (1964) (trial court improperly enjoined competition with former employer, in the absence of either non-competition covenant or protectible \u201ccustomer route\u201d). But appellees\u2019 right to pursue their own business interests is not absolute. \u201c[Ujnless otherwise agreed, after the termination of the agency, the agent . . . has a duty to the principal not to take advantage of a still subsisting confidential relation created during the prior agency relation\u201d). Restatement (Second) of Agency, supra at \u00a7 396(d).\nAppellees\u2019 contacts were possible because Adler Barish partners trusted appellees with the high responsibility of developing its clients\u2019 cases. From this position of trust and responsibility, appellees were able to gain knowledge of the details, and status, of each case to which appellees had been assigned. In the atmosphere surrounding appellees\u2019 departure, appellees\u2019 contacts unduly suggested a course of action for Adler Barish clients and unfairly prejudiced Adler Barish. No public interest is served in condoning use of confidential information which has these effects. Clients too easily may suffer in the end.\nIV. Conclusion\nIn Ohralik, Mr. Justice Powell emphasized:\n\u201c[T]he state bears a special responsibility for maintaining standards among members of the licensed professions. See Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.S. 483, 75 S.Ct. 461, 99 L.Ed. 563 (1955); Semler v. Oregon State Bd. of Dental Examiners, 294 U.S. 608, 55 S.Ct. 570, 79 L.Ed. 1086 (1935). \u2018The interest of the States in regulating lawyers is especially great since lawyers are essential to the primary governmental function of administering justice, and have historically been \u201cofficers of the courts.\u201d \u2019 Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U.S. 773, 792, 95 S.Ct. 2004, 2016, 44 L.Ed.2d 572 (1975). While lawyers act in part as \u2018self-employed businessmen,\u2019 they also act \u2018as trusted agents of their clients, and as assistants to the court in search of a just solution to disputes.\u2019 Cohen v. Hurley, 366 U.S. 117, 124, 81 S.Ct. 954, 958, 6 L.Ed.2d 156 (1961).\u201d\nOhralik v. Ohio State Bar Association, 436 U.S. at 460, 98 S.Ct. at 1920-21. Our \u201cspecial responsibility\u201d includes the obligation to assure that persons seeking professional legal assistance receive the quality advocacy and fair treatment they justifiably expect. Our responsibility also includes the duty to provide an atmosphere conducive to proper attorney-client relationships, including those situations where, as here, associates assist other members of a firm in rendering legal services. Consistent with these jurisprudential concerns, our supervisory authority over practitioners in our courts, prior decisions, the Code of Professional Responsibility, and Restatement (Second) of Torts, it must be concluded that the court of common pleas correctly determined that Adler Barish is entitled to relief.\nOrder of the Superior Court reversed and court of common pleas directed to reinstate its final decree. Each party pay own costs.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nAPPENDIX\nEpstein sent the following cover letter:\n404 South Camac Street Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19147 March 25, 1977\nDear In confirmation of our recent conversation, I have terminated my association with the offices of Adler, Barish,\nDaniels, Levin and Creskoff and will be continuing in the practice of law in center city Philadelphia.

Epstein, Esquire has terminated his association with your firm of attorneys and it has been carefully explained to me that I have the right to determine who shall represent me and handle the above-captioned matter.\nThis correspondence is to serve notice I hereby discharge the office of Adler, Barish, Daniels, Levin & Creskoff from any further representation of me whatsoever and request that the members of your firm and/or your employees or agents refrain from acting against my wishes in this regard or my interests in any way whatsoever.\nThis letter is to also serve as my notice and request that I want Alan B. Epstein to be my attorney in this matter, to keep or secure my file and all allied papers, and to handle this matter and represent me.\nI further direct you to deliver immediately to my attorney, Alan B. Epstein, my entire file and all allied papers and to refrain further from any actions contrary to my attorney\u2019s wishes or directions in connection with this matter.\nVery truly yours,\nThe following fee agreement was also sent to Adler Barish clients:\n. Appellees include Alan Epstein, Richard Weisbord, Arnold Wolf, and Sanford Jablon.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp.1978).\n. In establishing Adler Barish, its partners brought with them approximately 1300 cases from their old law firm, Freedman, Borowsky and Lorry, in which they shared approximately half the profits, losses, and assets. The two firms later signed a writing whose terms gave Adler Barish custody and control over the 1300 files transferred, and preserved the financial interest partners of Adler Barish had before leaving the Freedman firm. Clients whose files were transferred became clients of Adler Barish. From March, 1976 to April, 1977, Adler Barish opened over six hundred new case files.\nAppellees were salaried employees of the Freedman firm at the time Adler Barish was formed. Appellees left Freedman and went to work for Adler Barish.\nWe take our statement of facts from the findings of fact of the court of common pleas, sitting in equity. Neither party has challenged these findings, and the Superior Court did not disturb them. We accord the findings the weight of a jury verdict. Garges Estate, 474 Pa. 237, 378 A.2d 307 (1977); Kay v. Kay, 460 Pa. 680, 334 A.2d 585 (1975).\n. Avram Adler, partner of Adler Barish, testified that each new client gave Adler Barish a power of attorney and signed a contingent fee agreement comporting with Rule 202 of the Philadelphia Rules of Civil Procedure. Appellees do not dispute this testimony; indeed, the court of common pleas concluded that these agreements were \u201cvalid and existing.\u201d\n. The firm received documents relating to cases for which it apparently had no file. Contrary to the firm\u2019s procedure, Epstein personally maintained files for some cases. Likewise, Epstein did not adhere to Adler Barish policy concerning certain fees. Adler Barish obtained a case which was assigned to Epstein. He sent the file to an out-of-state attorney for further handling. Instead of turning over the forwarding fee to the firm, Epstein kept it for himself. It appears that these events led to termination of Epstein\u2019s employment.\n. See Appendix.\n. The same day, the court granted a rule on appellees to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not issue. On April 11, the court began to hear testimony. The court had fixed April 7 as the date for a hearing on the rule but, because of a conflict in the schedule of appellees\u2019 counsel, rescheduled the hearing for April 11. At the request of appellees, the court treated the proceedings as a final hearing.\n. On May 18, 1977, the Superior Court denied appellees\u2019 petition to stay the proceedings, \u201cprovided that an appeal bond in the sum of $200,000 is posted by [Adler Barish] by May 20, 1977,\u201d and advanced argument to June, 1977. The $200,000 appeal bond was twice the bond the court of common pleas fixed.\n. Appellees have not disputed the constitutionality of an injunction as a form of sanction; rather, they argue that no sanction may, constitutionally, be imposed.\n. Appellees\u2019 contacts pose consequences more serious than mailing of announcements in conformity with DR 2-102 and as allowed by the decree of the court of common pleas. Appellees\u2019 contacts make express their interest in Adler Barish clients\u2019 cases, while announcements, at most, only suggest the same. Moreover, appellees\u2019 form letters and self-addressed envelopes, unlike announcements, provide appellees a means of benefitting from a clients\u2019 immediate, perhaps ill-considered, response to the circumstances.\n. We also recognize that In re Primus, 436 U.S. 412, 98 S.Ct. 1893, 56 L.Ed.2d 417 (1978), forbids governmental sanctioning of an attorney who, in pursuit of ideological goals, advises a prospective client of legal rights and offers the free legal assistance of a nonprofit organization of which the attorney is a member. But appellees\u2019 goals were vastly different. Appellees were interested not in any particular client or the specific issues the cases they sought might raise, but rather their own financial gain.\n. Two earlier eases cited Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 766, with approval. Bloom v. Devonian Gas & Oil Co., 397 Pa. 309, 155 A.2d 195 (1959); Bright v. Pittsburgh Musical Society, 379 Pa. 335, 108 A.2d 810 (1954).\nThis Court had long recognized a right of action for interference with existing contractual relations. For example, in Vanarsdale v. Laverty, 69 Pa. 103 (1871), we affirmed a judgment against citizens of a community who, without justification, petitioned their school board to terminate the employment of the plaintiff, a school teacher. \u201cA groundless petition instigated only by malice cannot surely be the right of any citizen where it actually results in harm to the object of its malicious purpose.\u201d 69 Pa. at 109. In Caskie v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., 321 Pa. 157, 184 A. 17 (1936), we found sufficient to state a cause of action plaintiff\u2019s allegations that the defendant misrepresented to the party with whom plaintiff had contracted that the party did not have to pay plaintiff for services performed. And, in Dora v. Dora, 392 Pa. 433, 141 A.2d 587 (1958), we upheld plaintiffs\u2019 right of action where the defendant bank, upon the misrepresentations of other defendants, improperly paid over funds to which plaintiffs, pursuant to a settlement agreement, were entitled. \u201c \u2018[I]t is a violation of legal right to interfere with contractual relations recognized by law if there be no sufficient justification for the interference;\u2019 . . intentional doing of the wrongful act without legal justification [is] all that [is] necessary [to state a cause of action].\u201d 392 Pa. at 433, 141 A.2d at 590 (quoting Klauder v. Cregar, 327 Pa. 1, 7, 192 A. 667, 670 (1937)).\n. Accordingly, in Birl we compared plaintiffs allegations that the defendants induced plaintiffs employer to terminate plaintiffs employment with the elements set forth in Section 766 and concluded that the plaintiff \u201csufficiently aver[red] an intentional or purposeful, and unprivileged, interference with [his] contractual or business relationship, aimed at a severance of [plaintiffs employment], to constitute an actionable wrong.\u201d 402 Pa. at 303, 167 A.2d at 475.\nSince Birl, we have repeatedly looked to the Restatement as authority for the elements of a cause of action for intentional interference with existing contract relations. E. g., Capecci v. Liberty Corp., 406 Pa. 197, 176 A.2d 664 (1962) (applying Restatement, but denying plaintiff relief for want of proper proof of unlawful inducement); Glazer v. Chandler, 414 Pa. 304, 308, 200 A.2d 416, 418 (1964) (\u201cwhere, as in this case, the allegations and evidence only disclose that defendant breached his contracts with plaintiff and that as an incidental consequence thereof plaintiffs business relationships with third parties have been affected, an action lies only in contract for defendant\u2019s breaches, and the consequential damages recoverable, if any, may be adjudicated only in that action\u201d). Also, in Glenn v. Point Park College, 441 Pa. 474, 272 A.2d 895 (1971), we made clear our adoption of that portion of Section 766 relating to interference with prospective, as opposed to existing, contract relations. Thus, in Glenn we upheld real estate brokers\u2019 right of action where they sought damages from the vendee of realty for the vendee\u2019s direct purchase of realty from the vendor, depriving brokers \u201cprospective economic gain\u201d in the form of anticipated commissions on the sale.\n. Cf. Drexel v. Union Prescription Centers, Inc., 582 F.2d 781, 793 (3rd Cir. 1978) (federal court of appeals, reviewing conclusions of law of federal district court sitting in diversity case, observing that: \u201cthe Supreme Court of Pennsylvania\u2019s customary practice, when fashioning new principles of law, of according great weight to the decisions of other jurisdictions and the trend of recent cases would lead it to follow . numerous courts ... in situations analogous to the present case\u201d) (footnote, citing Pennsylvania cases, omitted).\n. Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibits P-20 \u2014 P-29 are the forms Epstein prepared discharging Adler Barish as counsel which various Adler Barish clients signed.\n. See supra note 4; Richette v. Pennsylvania Railroad, 410 Pa. 6, 21, 187 A.2d 910, 918 (1963) (\u201c \u2018the law has long been settled that contracts for [contingent] fees are lawful and enforceable by the courts\u2019 \u201d).\n. Thus, new Restatement (Second) of Torts focuses upon whether conduct is \u201cproper,\u201d rather than \u201cprivileged.\u201d Compare Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 766 (1939) (\u201c[e]xcept as stated in Section 698 [(relating to contracts to marry)], one who without a privilege to do so, induces or otherwise purposely causes a third person not to \u00b6 (a) perform a contract with another, or ][ (b) enter into or continue a business relation with another 11 is liable to the other for the harm caused thereby\u201d (emphasis added)). Comment b to Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra at \u00a7 767, explains the shift in inquiry:\n\u201cPrivilege to interfere, or interference not improper. Unlike other intentional torts such as intentional injury to person or property, or defamation, this branch of tort law has not developed a crystallized set of definite rules as to the existence or non-existence of a privilege to act in the manner stated in \u00a7\u00a7 766, 766A or 766B. Because of this fact, this Section is expressed in terms of whether the interference is improper or not rather than in terms of a specific privilege to act in the manner specified. The issue in each case is whether the interference is improper or not under the circumstances; whether, upon a consideration of the relative significance of the factors involved, the conduct should be permitted without liability, despite its effect of harm to another.\u201d\n. Glenn v. Point Park College, supra, 441 Pa. at 482, 272 A.2d at 899, quoting Harper & James, The Law of Torts, \u00a7 6.11.\n. Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra at \u00a7 767 comment c, provides in full:\n\u201cBusiness ethics and customs. Recognized ethical codes for a particular area of business activity and established customs or practices regarding approved or disapproved actions or methods may also be significant in evaluating the nature of the actor\u2019s conduct as a factor in determining whether his interference with the plaintiff\u2019s economic relations was improper or not.\u201d\n. In Bichette, an attorney representing an employee of the defendant railroad company and member of the defendant union, brought suit charging that defendants improperly interfered with a fee agreement between plaintiff and the employee. The employee, injured at work, had retained plaintiff, but later discharged him. In upholding the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages for plaintiff, this Court concluded:\n\u201cThe jury was warranted in finding from the evidence presented that the named defendants coordinated, through wile, stratagem and deception to separate an attorney from his client. It could not be said, as a matter of the law, that the jury went astray when they concluded, as they must have, that [the employee] did not voluntarily write a letter revoking his power of attorney to [plaintiff]. Logic, sequence of events, and palpable circumstances justify their conclusion that the railroad company representatives prepared a letter of revocation, that they employed a maneuver to have [the employee] copy that letter outside the railroad company office, thinking that this would wipe away their participation in the affair; that they supplied [the employee] with the paper on which he was to copy the letter of revocation; that [a union official], working with the railroad, supervised the copying, and supplied the envelope, in which he placed the letter, which he consigned to the United States mails. The jury were warranted in concluding that all the named defendants were a part of this plan and participated fully in the enterprise which finally resulted in depriving a member of the Philadelphia bar from legal business properly his.\u201d\n410 Pa. at 13-14, 187 A.2d at 914-15. First Pennsylvania Bank\u2019s willingness to extend appellees credit on the basis of expected fees from cases confirms the financial significance of Adler Barish\u2019s fee agreements.\n. Moreover, appellees neither occupied the same status, nor pursued the same goals, as the defendants in Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society v. Dougherty, 337 Pa. 286, 11 A.2d 147 (1940). There, we concluded that defendants, leaders of their church, \u201ccannot be mulcted in damages for protesting against the utterances of one who they believe attacks their church and misrepresents its teachings or for inducing their adherents to make, similar protests.\u201d 337 Pa. at 288, 11 A.2d at 148. Nor were appellees engaging in conduct like the defendant in R. S. Noonan, Inc. v. York School District, 400 Pa. 391, 162 A.2d 623 (1960) (alternative holding), where we found \u201cprivileged\u201d the actions of a school board architect who, upon the direction of the school board, advertised for new bids after the board rejected plaintiffs previous low bid.\nAppellees suggest that injunctive relief was inappropriate. \u201cIt is well settled that equity will act to prevent unjustified interference with contractual relations.\u201d Neel v. Allegheny County Memorial Park, 391 Pa. 354, 357, 137 A.2d 785, 787 (1958). Accord, Restatement (Second) of Torts, supra at \u00a7 766 comment t (approving injunctive relief \u201cin appropriate circumstances\u201d). Given appellees\u2019 interest in maintaining the line of credit established on the basis of Adler Barish cases, and appellees\u2019 express intent to continue their effort to gain Adler Barish clients, we believe the court of common pleas could properly conclude that equitable relief was necessary to protect all the interests at stake in this case."}
