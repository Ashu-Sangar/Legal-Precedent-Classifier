{"id": "582379", "contents": "Opinion by Mr.\nJustice Roberts,\nAppellant, Daniel Frazier, appeals from the denial of relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act [PCHA], Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1180-1 to -14 (Supp. 1973). Certain of the issues he presently raises were decided adversely to him in his direct appeal, Commonwealth v. Frazier, 443 Pa. 178, 279 A.2d 33 (1971), and are therefore finally litigated. PCHA, supra at 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-4(a) (3). These issues may not now be reconsidered, either under the theories then advanced, or under new theories now argued. Commonwealth v. Orr, 450 Pa. 632, 301 A.2d 608 (1973); Commonwealth v. Slavik, 449 Pa. 424, 297 A.2d 920 (1972).\nAppellant\u2019s remaining claims were raised in the trial court, decided on the merits, and not presented in his direct appeal. Consequently, they are likewise finally litigated and may not be reviewed. PCHA, supra at 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-4(a) (1).\nAppellant asserts, however, that his appellate counsel was ineffective because counsel did not present on direct appeal every issue raised at trial. Our examination of the record satisfies us that this contention is without merit. See Commonwealth v. Hill, 450 Pa. 477, 301 A.2d 587 (1973); Commonwealth v. Baker, 429 Pa. 209, 239 A.2d 201 (1968); Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A.2d 349 (1967). See also ABA Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 7-101 (B)(1) (1969).\nOrder affirmed."}
