{"id": "1919734", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nAmerican St. Gobain Corporation and Green Manufacturing Corporation, appellants, take this appeal from the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County in which the jury awarded the plaintiffappellee a verdict. Plaintiff, an employee of Green, was injured when a large crate containing heavy glass fell upon him while unloading a truck. The crates of glass had been loaded and braced by American and transported on a truck of Lyons Transportation Lines, Inc. (found not liable by the jury below) to the consignee, Green.\nPlaintiff\u2019s apparent theory was that due to improper loading and bracing the load shifted into an unstable position during transit and then fell during unloading. We have, however, searched the record and have not found any evidence describing the manner in which the accident occurred, or how the improper loading caused the injury. In order to carry his burden of proving defendant negligent, plaintiff must prove what did happen. Since plaintiff had no knowledge of what happened and there were no other eyewitnesses present, the case rested on the existence of expert testimony given by plaintiff\u2019s expert witness.\nHowever, plaintiff\u2019s expert witness did not testify as to how the accident happened, nor that in his opinion the accident happened in a described manner. He would not unqualifiedly say how the accident occurred. Instead, he used such words as \u201cfeasible\u201d, \u201ccould\u201d, \u201cpossible\u201d, and \u201cwithin the realm of reason.\u201d We have often said that such opinion evidence falls below the required standard of proof and is not sufficient to satisfy plaintiff\u2019s burden of convincing the factfinder.

Mesta Machine Co., 286 Pa. 199, 133 Atl. 256 (1926); Stephen Feldman \u201c. . . Sufficiency of Circumstantial Evidence of Negligence. . . .\u201d 72 Dick. L. Rev. 409, 421-22 (1968). Mr. Chief Justice Moschzisker in the Vorbnoff case stated the rule which governs here: \u201c. . . [N]ot that the condition of claimant might have, or even probably did, come from the accident, but that \u2018in his professional opinion the result in question came from the cause alleged\u2019 . . . .\u201d\nWith no testimony as to what actually caused the injury, the jury was forced to guess. \u201cA verdict will not be sustained which is based on conjecture or surmise or guess.\u201d Flaherty v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 426 Pa. 83, 231 A. 2d 179 (1967), and cases cited therein.\nSince plaintiff failed to prove that defendant\u2019s negligence caused plaintiff\u2019s injury, it was error in the court to deny defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v.\nJudgment reversed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno did not participate in the decision of this case."}
