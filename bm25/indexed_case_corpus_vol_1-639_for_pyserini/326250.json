In its final analysis the case turned on\u00a1 the; answer to, the inquiry whether the testimony would sustain a finding by the jury that the defendant\u2019s motorman had knowledge, or by the exercise of proper care would have known that the plaintiff\u2019s automobile was on the track in time to avoid injury to it. The case is a close one but it involves only the application of well recognized principles of law to a particular state of facts, and it belongs to a class of cases in which the judgments of the Superior Court should be considered as final.

Kraemer v. Guarantee Trust & Safe Deposit Co., 173 Pa. 416.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
