The order of the Commonwealth Court is REVERSED. See Coretsky v. Board of Commissioners of Butler Township, 520 Pa. 513, 555 A.2d 72, 74 (1989) (when Board fails to cite to statute or ordinance to explain why application was denied, the application is deemed approved as filed), and 53 P.S. \u00a7 10508(3) (same). Petitioner\u2019s remaining issue is DENIED.\nJustice SAYLOR files a Concurring Statement."}
