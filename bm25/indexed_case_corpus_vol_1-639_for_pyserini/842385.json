{"id": "842385", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\n. On the trial of this issue, directed by the court to determine how much was due on the note, upon which the judgment opened, etc., was entered, the defendant was permitted to introduce testimony to sustain the offer recited in the first specification of error. The objection to the offer was, \u201c that the evidence was incompetent, its effect being to vary, alter and amend the written agreement which shows the actual contract between the parties.\u201d This objection was not well taken, and hence there was no error in overruling it and receiving the testimony.\nThe consideration of the note was part of the sum which defendant agreed to pay plaintiff for a certain bottling business, and the appurtenances, sold by him to defendant. As expressed in the written agreement, said sale was of \u201c all his, A. F. Volkenand\u2019s bottling business located in a certain-frame building situated on West Green street, between Vine and Locust, in Hazleton borough, consisting of three wagons, two horses, one set of double harness, bottles, boxes, and in fact everything in and about the premises pertaining to the bottling business hereby sold.\u201d The agreement, as will be observed, does not specify the number of \u201c bottles \u201d and \u201c boxes; \u201d and, inasmuch as many of these were then, necessarily, in the course of the business, in the possession of plaintiff\u2019s customers, defendant was obliged to rely on plaintiff\u2019s representations as to the number of each then out, temporarily, in the hands of his customers. The testimony complained of was offered for the purpose of showing that plaintiff deceitfully and fraudulently misrepresented to defendant, \u201c that he had in connection with his bottling business nine hundred boxes filled with bottles; \u201d that these boxes and bottles were distributed among his customers, etc. The evidence introduced came fully up to the terms of the offer, and appears to have satisfied the jury that the alleged fraudulent misrepresentation was successfully practiced, and consequently there was a failure of consideration at least equal to the amount of the note in controversy.- The verdict in favor of the defendant in the issue necessarily implies a finding of these facts.\nThere was no error in admitting the evidence referred to in the second specification. It is of the same character as that already referred to in connection with the offer covered by the first specification. If the learned judge\u2019s action in admitting the evidence complained \u00f3f needed any vindication, it will be found in what he said in disposing of plaintiff\u2019s objection.\nThe subject of complaint in the third specification is an excerpt from the charge of the court.\nIn'that portion of his charge, the learned president of the common pleas clearly and accurately explained to the. jury, that the purpose of defendant\u2019s evidence was not to impeach and overthrow the written agreement; and, in that connection, he said: \u201c The plaintiff\u2019s counsel contends that because the written contract does not specify the number of boxes and bottles sold, therefore it is incompetent to show by oral testimony what was said between the parties on that subject. . . . But that fact, in our judgment, is not a conclusive fact, and therefore'we have \u2022 admitted the testimony as to what was said between the parties concerning the number of boxes and bottles connected with the business.\u201d\nThere is not the slightest semblance of error in that or any \u25a0other part of the charge. As established by the verdict, based upon competent evidence, the troublesome and controlling fact, with which plaintiff had to contend, was that in effecting the sale and obtaining defendant\u2019s notes for the price agreed upon, he practiced a fraud, by deceitfully misrepresenting the number of boxes and bottles connected with his bottling business, the consequences of which fraud, measured in dollars and cents, \u25a0the defendant had a right to defalk against his outstanding obligation.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s seven points for charge, recited in the last\nseven specifications, were-each\" negatived. Without breaking bulk and undertaking to vindicate the action of the court in refusing to affirm those points*, respectively, it is sufficient to say they were each and all rightly answered in the negative. In refusing the seventh point, the learned judge correctly and appropriately said to the jury : \u201cYou will observe that thes\u00e9 points all ask us to practically take the case from the jury and decide as a question of law. We-negative them because we think there are questions of fact to be decided by the jury, and these questions we submit to you under the general instructions contained in our charge.\u201d\nThe case was ably and correctly tried, and there is nothing, in any of the rulings of the court, of which the plaintiff can justly complain.\nJudgment affirmed."}
