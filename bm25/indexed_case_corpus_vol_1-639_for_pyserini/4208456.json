{"id": "4208456", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice McCAFFERY.\nMark Newton Spotz (\u201cAppellant\u201d) has appealed from the denial of his petition for collateral relief filed pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), following his conviction in York County for first-degree murder and the imposition of a sentence of death. Concluding that there is no merit to any of the numerous issues that Appellant has raised on appeal, we affirm the order of the PCRA court.\nTo begin, we set forth the relevant facts of the case, summarized primarily from this Court\u2019s opinion on direct appeal. See Commonwealth v. Spotz, 562 Pa. 498, 756 A.2d 1139, 1147-48 (2000) (\u201cSpotz II \u201d). At 6:20 a.m. on February 2, 1995, in York County, Appellant approached Penny Gun-net\u2019s vehicle on the pretense of asking her for directions. He forced her into the passenger seat of her car at gunpoint and then drove to an isolated area. Christina Noland, Appellant\u2019s then-girlfriend, followed him, driving a car they had stolen the previous day in Schuylkill County. While both cars were stopped on an isolated road, Noland heard three gunshots. Appellant then sped off in Ms. Gunnet\u2019s car, with Noland in unsuccessful pursuit in the other stolen car. Ms. Gunnet\u2019s body was found later that morning under the wheels of her abandoned car. Hours after the murder, Appellant tried to sell some of Ms. Gunnet\u2019s jewelry, and he later gave her rings to his ex-wife, Michelle Rhinehart.\nPolice apprehended Appellant in a motel room in Carlisle, Blair County, the day after Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder. When Appellant opened the door to the room and surrendered, he discarded a silver nine-millimeter semiautomatic pistol that was subsequently identified as the weapon that had fired at least two of the three nine-millimeter bullets recovered from Ms. Gunnet\u2019s car. In the motel room, police found Appellant\u2019s bloodstained jeans, a knife, nine-millimeter \u201cfull metal jacket\u201d ammunition, five credit cards issued in Ms. Gunnet\u2019s name, and one credit card issued in her husband\u2019s name.\nThe abduction and murder of Ms. Gunnet was part of a three-day crime spree, during which Appellant committed four homicides in four counties. Two days before Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder, on January 31, 1995, Appellant shot and killed his brother, Dustin Spotz, in Clearfield County and then fled with Ms. Noland. The next day, in need of money and a vehicle, Appellant abducted June Ohlinger at gunpoint in Schuylkill County, drove her car to a remote area, and then shot her in the head. After a brief trip to Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where Appellant and Ms. Noland attempted to alter their appearances, they drove to York County in search of another vehicle to steal. This was the point at which they came upon Ms. Gunnet. Following the abduction and murder of Ms. Gunnet, Ms. Noland went to Altoona in Blair County, where she surrendered to police, and Appellant went to Cumberland County, where he abducted and murdered his fourth victim, Betty Amstutz, and stole her car and her money.\nAppellant was tried separately for each homicide. He was ultimately convicted of voluntary manslaughter in the death of Dustin Spotz in Clearfield County, and of first-degree murder in the deaths of Ms. Ohlinger, Ms. Gunnet, and Ms. Amstutz, in, respectively, Schuylkill, York, and Cumberland Counties. During the guilt phase of his trials in York and Cumberland Counties, Appellant proceeded pro se. Although the Superior Court overturned Appellant\u2019s voluntary manslaughter conviction and granted him a new trial, this Court reversed and reinstated the conviction. Commonwealth v. Spotz, 582 Pa. 207, 870 A.2d 822 (2005) (\u201cSpotz IV\u201d). On direct appeal, this Court affirmed each of Appellant\u2019s three first-degree murder convictions and sentences of death. See Commonwealth v. Spotz, 552 Pa. 499, 716 A.2d 580 (1998) (Schuylkill County) (\u201cSpotz I \u201d); Spotz II, 756 A.2d at 1139 (York County); Commonwealth v. Spotz, 563 Pa. 269, 759 A.2d 1280 (2000) (Cumberland County) (\u201cSpotz III \u201d). In addition, we subsequently affirmed the orders of the PCRA courts denying Appellant collateral relief from his Schuylkill County and Cumberland County first-degree murder convictions. See, respectively, Commonwealth v. Spotz, 587 Pa. 1, 896 A.2d 1191 (2006) (\u201cSpotz V\u201d) and Commonwealth v. Spotz, 610 Pa. 17, 18 A.3d 244 (2011) (\u201cSpotz VI \u201d). Here, Appellant seeks review of the order of the PCRA court denying his petition for collateral relief from his York County first-degree murder conviction.\nAppellant filed a pro se PCRA petition challenging his York County conviction as well as a request for appointment of counsel in April 2001. On August 20, 2001, the Defender Association of Philadelphia filed a PCRA petition on Appellant\u2019s behalf. See Amended Petition for Habeas Corpus Relief under Article I, Section 14 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and for Statutory Post-Conviction Relief under the PCRA, filed 8/20/01. Subsequently, the Defender Association filed two supplements, on May 20, 2002, and May 31, 2007, respectively. With all of these filings, Appellant raised 34 issues before the PCRA court. PCRA Court Opinion, dated March 25, 2010, at 4. The court held a PCRA hearing from September 17 through September 19, 2007. After Appellant\u2019s competency was placed into question, the PCRA court continued the hearing, pending completion of competency evaluations. The PCRA court subsequently determined that Appellant was competent, and then resumed the PCRA hearing from June 9 through June 13, 2008. Appellant appeared via videoconference. Id. at 5. The PCRA court filed an opinion and order on March 25, 2010, denying all of Appellant\u2019s claims.\nAppellant filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court, raising 11 issues for review, most of which include several sub-issues, for an approximate total of 37 claims. Before addressing the issues raised, we set forth our standard of review, the relevant statutory requirements under the PCRA, and the relevant legal principles controlling claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. See Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 259-60.\nUnder the applicable standard of review, we must determine whether the ruling of the PCRA court is supported by the record and is free of legal error. Commonwealth v. Hutchinson, 611 Pa. 280, 25 A.3d 277, 284 (2011). The PCRA court\u2019s credibility determinations, when supported by the record, are binding on this Court; however, we apply a de novo standard of review to the PCRA court\u2019s legal conclusions. Id.\nTo prevail on a petition for PCRA relief, a petitioner must plead and prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his or her conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the circumstances enumerated in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2). These circumstances include a constitutional violation or ineffectiveness of counsel, either of which \u201cso undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2)(i) and (ii). In addition, a petitioner must show that the claims of error have not been previously litigated or waived. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(3). An issue has been waived \u201cif the petitioner could have raised it but failed to do so before trial, at trial, on appeal or in a prior state post[-]conviction proceeding.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b). An issue has been previously litigated if \u201cthe highest appellate court in which the petitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(a)(2); see Hutchinson, supra at 284-85; Spotz VI, supra at 259.\nWith respect to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, we begin with the presumption that counsel is effective. Hutchinson, supra at 285. To prevail on an ineffectiveness claim, a petitioner must plead and prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, three elements: (1) the underlying legal claim has arguable merit; (2) counsel had no reasonable basis for his or her action or inaction; and (3) the petitioner suffered prejudice because of counsel\u2019s action or inaction. Id. (citing Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987)). With regard to the second, i.e., the \u201creasonable basis\u201d prong, we will conclude that counsel\u2019s chosen strategy lacked a reasonable basis only if the petitioner proves that \u201can alternative not chosen offered a potential for success substantially greater than the course actually pursued.\u201d Id. (quoting Commonwealth v. Williams, 587 Pa. 304, 899 A.2d 1060, 1064 (2006)). To establish the third, i.e., the prejudice prong, the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different but for counsel\u2019s action or inaction. Id.\nIssue 1: Waiver of Counsel\nIn Issue 1, Appellant claims that his guilt-phase waiver of counsel was constitutionally invalid because of four alleged circumstances: (a) counsel\u2019s conflict of interest; (b) counsel\u2019s failure to investigate or prepare a guilt-phase defense; (c) Appellant\u2019s mental incapacity; and (d) the trial court\u2019s improper restrictions on standby counsel. Just prior to trial, Appellant indicated to the court that he wanted to proceed pro se because of alleged conflicts with his counsel, assistant public defenders Bruce Blocher and Suzanne Smith. After an extensive colloquy, the trial court granted Appellant\u2019s request to represent himself, and appointed Mr. Blocher and Ms. Smith as standby counsel. Notes of Testimony (\u201cN.T.\u201d) Trial, 4/8/96, at 12, and 4/12/96, at 32-36. Appellant does not challenge the colloquy; rather, he asserts that his \u201cpurported waiver [of the right to counsel] was an incompetent and invalid by-product\u201d of the factors listed above. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18.\nThe PCRA court denied relief, citing the trial court\u2019s two thorough and proper colloquies; crediting defense counsel\u2019s PCRA testimony that Appellant understood what was happening at trial and the nature of his offense; and recognizing that this Court had concluded on direct appeal that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant\u2019s pretrial request for appointment of new counsel. PCRA Court Opinion, dated 3/25/10, at 8-11 (citing Spotz II, 756 A.2d at 1150). We address the four circumstances identified by Appellant in turn, recognizing that each constitutes a separate sub-issue.\nWith regard to sub-issue (a), Appellant alleges that defense counsel had three conflicts of interest, rendering Appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel involuntary. The first alleged conflict was Mr. Blocher\u2019s representation of another defendant, whose interests conflicted with Appellant\u2019s interests. The potential conflict was addressed in a pretrial hearing held on June 30,1995. At that time, Mr. Blocher informed the trial court that two individuals, Russell Bloss and Tyrone Lowe, who were imprisoned with Appellant, had made statements to officials from Cumberland County to the effect that they had heard Appellant admit his involvement in the Schuylkill, York, and Clearfield County homicides. N.T. Pre-trial Hearing, 6/30/95, at 2. Mr. Blocher was representing Mr. Bloss at the time he made the statements, although Mr. Blocher was not present when Mr. Bloss spoke with the officials. Mr. Lowe was represented by another attorney in the public defender\u2019s office. At the June 30, 1995 hearing, the prosecutor stated that he did not intend to call Bloss or Lowe as witnesses at Appellant\u2019s trial. Id. at 2-3. Appellant stated that he did not have a problem with Mr. Blocher\u2019s representation so long as the public defenders were not \u201cprejudiced\u201d against him. Id. at 3. Mr. Blocher stated on the record that he had no prejudice toward Appellant because he had no idea of the circumstances precipitating the Bloss/Lowe statements or their validity. Id. at 3-4. The trial court issued an order permitting Mr. Blocher to remain as Appellant\u2019s counsel and finding no conflict of interest so long as the Bloss/Lowe information was not used by the Commonwealth. Neither Mr. Bloss nor Mr. Lowe was called as a witness at Appellant\u2019s trial.\nThe entire matter was raised at the PCRA hearing. During Appellant\u2019s direct examination, he confirmed that, at the time of the June 30, 1995 hearing, he was not concerned about the Bloss/Lowe statements, was satisfied with the resolution of the issue, and had no further conversations with counsel concerning this issue. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/13/2008, at 790-97. Nonetheless, on cross-examination, Appellant asserted that the Bloss/Lowe statements \u201cprejudiced\u201d his counsel against him. Id. at 884. Appellant has not provided the slightest explanation, rationale, or argument as to how or why his view of counsel\u2019s response to the statements and attitude toward him changed between the time of the June 30, 1995 pretrial hearing and the time of his trial in April of 1996, creating \u201cone of the big issues\u201d of which he complains. Id.\nAppellant fails to acknowledge the standard for establishment of a conflict of interest, to wit, that \u201ccounsel actively represented conflicting interests, and the actual conflict adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 268 (citation omitted). Appellant proffers only speculation on top of speculation, which cannot come close to meeting this standard. Appellant provides absolutely no indication, much less evidence, that the Bloss/Lowe statements were ever raised again or used in any way by anyone, either in the multiple prosecutions against Appellant or in bargaining for favorable treatment of Mr. Bloss or Mr. Lowe. We have no idea when Mr. Blocher\u2019s representation of Mr. Bloss started and when it ceased. Appellant cites no evidence whatsoever that his counsel\u2019s performance was in any way affected by the Bloss/Lowe statements. Appellant merely asserts that, because of the alleged conflict, \u201ccounsel did not investigate whether the prosecution had been enlisting prisoners to obtain information about [Appellant], evidence which would have undermined the credibility of Christina Noland and Charles Carothers [and would have] reveal[ed] the extent to which the Commonwealth was willing to go to encourage witnesses to fabricate events and reward versions \u2018favorable\u2019 to its theories.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 19. Appellant\u2019s allegation is nothing short of wild speculation, unsupported by any facts of record whatsoever. Thus, Appellant has failed to make any showing that his counsel had a conflict of interest with regard to the Bloss/Lowe statements.\nAppellant\u2019s second and third allegations of conflicts with his counsel relate to Mr. Blocher\u2019s pretrial notifications to the trial court of Appellant\u2019s threats to Ms. Noland and to defense counsel on, respectively, March 14, 1996, and April 3, 1996. Based on this information, the trial court arranged for additional security measures in the courtroom. On direct appeal, Appellant raised a very similar issue, claiming that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his request to appoint new counsel and new standby counsel, based on the same threats and the same alleged conflicts of interest that Appellant asserts here. See Spotz II, 756 A.2d at 1149-50. In concluding on direct appeal that the trial court had acted properly in addressing the threats, we recognized that the court had thoroughly evaluated the \u201cpotential conflict\u201d and had been assured by Appellant\u2019s counsel that they were able to advocate zealously on his behalf. Id. at 1150. We then held as follows:\n[T]he \u201cconflict\u201d here resulted from [A]ppellant\u2019s own conduct, and the security measures that his purported conduct required. Even if new counsel were appointed, the security concern ... would remain. In response to [Appellant\u2019s threats and attempts to manipulate, the court took appropriate measures to ensure the safety of counsel and [Appellant\u2019s right to effective, conflict-free representation. There was no abuse of discretion by the trial court in refusing to appoint new counsel or new standby counsel for [A]ppellant.\nId. at 1150.\nDespite our holding on direct appeal, Appellant asserted at the PCRA hearing and maintains here that the same alleged \u201cconflict\u201d due to the same threats rendered his waiver of counsel involuntary. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/13/2008, at 809^9; Appellant\u2019s Brief at 19-20. As we held on direct appeal, any conflict resulted from Appellant\u2019s own conduct, and the trial court responded appropriately to ensure both a safe environment in and around the courtroom, as well as Appellant\u2019s right to counsel. Appellant\u2019s argument that his waiver of counsel was involuntary because of a conflict with counsel \u2014 a \u201cconflict\u201d that Appellant created \u2014 is circular, self-defeating, and meritless.\nTherefore, because none of Appellant\u2019s claims as to alleged conflicts with his counsel has any merit, his assertion that his waiver of counsel was involuntary due to conflicts with counsel must fail.\nWith regard. to sub-issue (b), Appellant alleges that his counsel failed to prepare any defense at all, specifically a diminished capacity defense, which \u201cforced\u201d Appellant to proceed pro se. Appellant neither presents evidence nor develops an argument to support this contention; he merely directs us to Issue 4. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 20-21. Accordingly, we have addressed this claim, and determined it to be meritless, under Issue 4\nWith regard to sub-issue (c), Appellant asserts that his waiver of counsel was involuntary because he was suffering from a variety of mental disorders, including chronic, severe, post-traumatic stress disorder; borderline personality disorder; polysubstance abuse, in remission; and obsessive-compulsive disorder, which were exacerbated by \u201cthe extreme stress of a gauntlet of capital trials.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 21. Relying primarily on the PCRA testimony of his two mental health experts, Appellant asserts that he lacked the mental capacity to waive his right to counsel.\nWe have recently explained the competency standard for waiving the right to counsel as follows.\n[T]he competency standard for waiving the right to counsel is precisely the same as the competency standard for standing trial, and is not a higher standard. We have formulated this standard as follows: whether the defendant has the ability to consult with counsel with a reasonable degree of understanding and whether the defendant has a rational understanding of the nature of the proceedings. The focus is properly on the defendant\u2019s mental capacity, i.e., whether he or she has the ability to understand the proceedings. If a court finds a defendant incapable of waiving the right to counsel, then the court must also conclude that the defendant is incapable of standing trial. Finally, it is important to recognize that a defendant is presumed to be competent to stand trial, and the burden is on the appellant to prove that he was incompetent.\nSpotz VI, 18 A.3d at 266 (internal citations, quotation marks, and footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).\nIn denying relief on this sub-issue, the PCRA court applied the proper legal standard, cited the lengthy colloquies conducted by the trial court, and particularly credited the testimony of Appellant\u2019s counsel. PCRA Court Opinion at 8-10. We conclude that the PCRA court\u2019s ruling is supported by the record and is free of legal error, as we discuss in detail below, starting with a summary of the relevant testimony presented at Appellant\u2019s PCRA hearing.\nAssistant public defender Smith testified that \u201c[tjhere did not appear to be a competency issue\u201d with respect to Appellant at the time of trial, as he understood why he was in court, what he was doing, what was going on in court, and the nature of the murder with which he was charged. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/9/08, at 298-300. Ms. Smith\u2019s testimony was reinforced by that of Appellant himself, who testified that, at the time of trial, he understood the colloquy, he knew where he was, and he knew what was going on around him. Id., 6/13/08, at 876-77.\nStephen Ragusea, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist who interviewed Appellant a few months prior to trial, testified on Appellant\u2019s behalf both at the penalty phase of trial and at the PCRA hearing. At the penalty phase, Dr. Ragusea testified that he had been retained by defense counsel to do \u201ca general psychological evaluation [of Appellant] to determine, first of all, whether or not he was competent to stand trial; ... whether or not there was any evidence that he was insane at the time the crime was committed; and ... whether or not there were any possible conditions that might relate to mitigating circumstances.\u201d N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 326. Regarding the competency issue, Dr. Ragusea concluded as follows during his penalty phase testimony:\n[Appellant] was clearly competent to stand trial. There are criteria that we use to evaluate that, and he was clearly competent to stand trial.\nId. at 349.\nHowever, at the PCRA hearing, Dr. Ragusea testified that, if he had known that Appellant was reporting flashbacks to prison mental health professionals just before the trial, he would have suggested a competency evaluation and would have performed such an evaluation if the court had asked him to do so. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/12/08, at 645. Neither he nor anyone else suggested how such a competency evaluation would have differed from the evaluation for competency that Dr. Ragusea conducted prior to trial and discussed during his penalty phase testimony. Furthermore, Dr. Ragusea did not testify at any time that Appellant was unable either to understand the trial proceedings or to consult with his counsel regarding his defense.\nAlso at the PCRA hearing, Appellant presented the testimony of two psychiatrists, Robert Fox, Jr., M.D., and Neil Blumberg, M.D., both of whom were retained by PCRA counsel, and both of whom interviewed and evaluated Appellant, and reviewed his records, years after trial. Dr. Fox, who evaluated Appellant in 2000 and 2007 (respectively four and eleven years after Appellant\u2019s trial), testified that Appellant suffered from multiple severe psychiatric disorders. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/9/08, at 35-40. In Dr. Fox\u2019s view, because of Appellant\u2019s mental illness, he might easily change his behavior \u201con a moment[\u2019]s notice\u201d from working with his counsel in a reasonable way to turning against them and wanting to fire them. Id. at 146. Dr. Fox opined that Appellant \u201cwas driven to make the decision to go pro se by his personality and the way he was feeling[,] and it was triggered by some actual events.\u201d Id. at 150. A bit later in his testimony, Dr. Fox opined that Appellant\u2019s decision to represent himself was \u201ca product of his mental illness[,] the full totality of it.\u201d Id. at 152.\nDr. Blumberg, who interviewed Appellant several times in 2006, testified extensively as to Appellant\u2019s mental illnesses, opining that Appellant suffered from three different psychiatric conditions; had severely impaired self-esteem; viewed the world in a threatening way; had a hypervigilance deeply ingrained in his personality structure; demonstrated emotional liability and instability and was easily excited or upset; was prone to depression, anger, and quickly shifting emotions; tended to be moody and irritable; overresponded to stressful events; and had longstanding difficulties with impulse control. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/18/07, at 315, 409-12. Notably, Dr. Blumberg was not questioned about Appellant\u2019s competency to stand trial or waive counsel.\nImportantly, not a single witness opined that Appellant did not have the ability to understand the nature of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, or to participate in his own defense. Appellant bears the burden of proving that he was not competent to stand trial or to waive the right to counsel, the standard for which is one and the same. See Spotz VI, supra, at 266; Commonwealth v. Brawn, 582 Pa. 461, 872 A.2d 1139, 1156 (2005). Appellant has not come close to satisfying this standard, and thus we conclude that there is no merit to Appellant\u2019s claim that he was not competent to waive counsel.\nWith regard to sub-issue (d), Appellant asserts that \u201cthe [trial] court placed such severe limitations on what [standby] counsel could do that it rendered the appointment of standby counsel meaningless.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 24. In particular, Appellant cites the trial court\u2019s preclusion of counsel from taking notes, from instigating communications with Appellant, or from offering any arguments on his behalf. Id. Appellant asserts that these restrictions \u201cprevented Appellant from adequately presenting proper and viable defenses, legal arguments, and objections;\u201d however, Appellant fails to cite a single specific defense, argument, or objection that he did not proffer or make due to the trial court\u2019s limitations on standby counsel. Id.\nPrior to Appellant\u2019s final decision to proceed pro se, the trial court clearly delineated standby counsel\u2019s role, specifically informing Appellant that standby counsel is not the same as counsel; that if Appellant chose to represent himself, he, not his counsel, would be trying the case; that any mistakes he made during his self-representation could not be raised subsequently, as ineffectiveness of counsel was not a legal option on appeal in such circumstances; and that standby counsel cannot \u201csit there and go over the stuff with you as if they are really counsel but you are asking the questions.\u201d N.T. Trial, 4/12/96, at 25-30. The trial court\u2019s exhaustive instructions concerning standby counsel\u2019s role also included the following excerpts:\nCourt: [Standby counsel] will advise you [Appellant] as to any legal matters that come up. That\u2019s it. They are not trying the case, you [Appellant] are.\nId. at 32.\nCourt: Just so that we understand and you understand, I\u2019ve given some thought with regard to assistance by [standby] counsel. They can only advise you as to legal matters. Since they are familiar with the exhibits and so forth, they may help you. If you ask for an exhibit, they will give you the exhibit, but that\u2019s it, they won\u2019t discuss it with you. They won\u2019t read through it or tell you to look on [sic] the exhibit. They won\u2019t be able to sit and take notes. You\u2019ll have to do that on your own.\nId. at 36; see also id. at 39 (giving in essence the same instructions in shorter form).\nThis matter of the trial court\u2019s limitations on the role of standby counsel was addressed at the PCRA hearing. Mr. Blocher and Ms. Smith both testified that, as standby counsel, their role was limited to answering Appellant\u2019s legal questions, and they were not permitted to take notes concerning the trial testimony. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/17/07, at 91-92; id., 6/9/08, at 213-17. They were also not permitted to volunteer instructions to Appellant as to what to do next or to volunteer a suggestion that an objection might be warranted. Id., 9/17/07, at 92; id., 6/9/08, at 215-16. Ms. Smith further testified that the court\u2019s restriction on note-taking limited her ability to recall guilt-phase testimony and its potential relevance to evidence of mitigation during the penalty phase; however, she did not specify any particular instance in which her inability to recall the testimony affected her performance during the penalty phase or at any other time. Id., 6/9/08, at 217.\nThe PCRA court concluded that there was no merit to Appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly limited standby counsel\u2019s role. PCRA Court Opinion at 11. Noting that Appellant cited no supporting legal authority for his assertions of trial court error, the PCRA court relied on Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 121(D) to conclude that the trial court had properly instructed standby counsel. Furthermore, the PCRA court determined that standby counsel offered assistance when Appellant asked, provided him with documents, and discussed trial strategy, all of which were in accord with the proper role of standby counsel. Id. (citing N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/9/07, at 292-94 (cross-examination of Ms. Smith)).\nAs the Commonwealth correctly points out, Appellant has waived this sub-issue of trial court error. Our review of the record reveals no instance \u2014 and Appellant fails to indicate any instance \u2014 where any objection was made to the trial court\u2019s delineation of standby counsel\u2019s role. Nor was this issue raised on direct appeal. As the claim of trial court error has been waived, the only cognizable claim in this matter is a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to object to the trial court\u2019s limitations on standby counsel\u2019s role. After thorough review, we conclude that there is no arguable merit to Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim, because the trial court acted within its discretion in restricting standby counsel\u2019s role, and counsel is not ineffective for failing to raise a meritless objection.\nIn Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 834 n. 46, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), the United States Supreme Court determined that a state \u201cmay ... appoint a \u2018standby counsel\u2019 to aid the accused if and when the accused requests help, and to be available to represent the accused in the event that termination of [his or her] self-representation is necessary.\u201d This Commonwealth\u2019s Rules of Criminal Procedure provide for the appointment of standby counsel as follows:\n(D) Standby Counsel. When the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel is accepted, standby counsel may be appointed for the defendant. Standby counsel shall attend the proceedings and shall be available to the defendant for consultation and advice.\nPa.R.Crim.P. 121(D).\nAlthough neither the United States Supreme Court nor our Rules of Criminal Procedure mandate the appointment of standby counsel, a comment to Rule 121 suggests the advisability of appointing standby counsel to attend the proceedings and be available to the defendant for consultation and advice when the defendant has waived his right to counsel for a trial, especially in long or complicated cases. See also Commonwealth v. Szuchon, 506 Pa. 228, 484 A.2d 1365, 1376-77 (1984), abrogated on other grounds, Commonwealth v. Lucarelli, 601 Pa. 185, 971 A.2d 1173, 1179 (2009), (noting that it is \u201cstrongly advisable, especially in a potential death penalty case, that the trial judge appoint \u2018standby\u2019 counsel\u201d).\nMost relevant here, the appointment of standby counsel does not imply or authorize some sort of hybrid representation. See Commonwealth v. Ellis, 534 Pa. 176, 626 A.2d 1137, 1138-39 (1993) (agreeing with the Superior Court that \u201cthere is no right of self-representation together with counseled representation (\u2018hybrid representation\u2019) ... although standby counsel may be appointed to give the defendant legal advice.\u201d). When a defendant elects to proceed at trial pro se, the defendant \u2014 and not standby counsel \u2014 is in fact counsel of record and is responsible for trying the case. This understanding of the limited role of standby counsel is essential to satisfy the United States Supreme Court\u2019s directive that a defendant\u2019s choice to proceed pro se \u201cmust be honored out of \u2018that respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law\u2019 \u201d even when the defendant acts to his or her own detriment. Faretta, supra at 834, 95 S.Ct. 2525. This understanding also underlies our prior holding that a defendant who chooses to represent himself cannot obtain relief by raising a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel or standby counsel. Spotz VI, supra at 270 (citing Commonwealth v. Fletcher, 604 Pa. 493, 986 A.2d 759, 774 (2009)).\nThe trial court\u2019s directives as to the role of standby counsel in the instant case reflected a proper understanding of these principles. Consistently -with the PCRA court, we conclude that the trial court did not err or abuse its discretion in setting forth its restrictions on standby counsel\u2019s role. Accordingly, there is no arguable merit to Appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to object to those restrictions, and he is entitled to no relief.\nIn sum, with regard to Issue 1, Appellant\u2019s multi-pronged challenge to his waiver of the right to counsel, we conclude that there is no merit to any of Appellant\u2019s allegations or arguments. After careful review, we affirm the rulings of the PCRA court because they are supported by the record and are free of legal error.\nIssue 2: Disclosure of Impeachment Evidence against Ms. Noland\nIn Issue 2, Appellant asserts that his due process rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution were violated when the Commonwealth failed to disclose the terms of an alleged agreement reached with Ms. Noland whereby, in exchange for her trial testimony against Appellant, the charges against her would be reduced and she would receive lenient sentences. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 26 (citing Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995); Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959); Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 153-55, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972)). The Commonwealth disputes the existence of such an agreement, and the PCRA court concluded that Appellant had proffered no evidence to establish its existence. PCRA Court Opinion at 11-13.\nUnder Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), and subsequent decisional law, a prosecutor has an obligation to disclose all exculpatory information material to the guilt or punishment of an accused, including evidence of an impeachment nature. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Strong, 563 Pa. 455, 761 A.2d 1167, 1171 & n. 5 (2000). To establish a Brady violation, an appellant must prove three elements: (1) the evidence at issue is favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory or because it impeaches; (2) the evidence was suppressed by the prosecution, either willfully or inadvertently; and (3) prejudice ensued. Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 884 A.2d 848, 854 (2005). We stress that the burden rests with the appellant to \u201cprove, by reference to the record, that evidence was withheld or suppressed by the prosecution.\u201d Commonwealth v. Porter, 556 Pa. 301, 728 A.2d 890, 898 (1999). The evidence at issue must have been \u201cmaterial evidence that deprived the defendant of a fair trial.\u201d Commonwealth v. Johnson, 572 Pa. 283, 815 A.2d 563, 573 (2002). \u201cFavorable evidence is material, and constitutional error results from its suppression by the government, if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d Id. (quoting Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 433, 115 S.Ct 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995))\nBrady evidence encompasses information as to any potential understanding between the prosecution and a witness because such information is relevant to the witness\u2019s credibility and may be used for impeachment. Spotz V, supra at 1214; Strong, supra at 1171-72. \u201cImpeachment evidence which goes to the credibility of a primary witness against the accused is critical evidence and it is material to the case [even when] that evidence is merely a promise or an understanding between the prosecution and the witness.\u201d Id. (quoting Strong, supra at 1175). Thus, to qualify as Brady evidence, an agreement between the prosecution and a witness need not be a formal, signed document, but may be simply a promise or an understanding that the prosecution will extend leniency and favorable treatment in exchange for a witness\u2019s testimony. Strong, supra at 1175.\nFor Appellant to obtain collateral relief on this Brady claim, he must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that an agreement between the Commonwealth and Ms. Noland existed and that the failure to disclose the agreement so undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place. Strong, supra at 1171; 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2)(f).\nTo resolve the specific claim that Appellant raises here, we must first set forth the relevant facts in detail. In February 1995, Ms. Noland was charged by the York County District Attorney with first-degree murder, second-degree murder, kidnapping, robbery of motor vehicle, unlawful restraint, theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property, and criminal conspiracy. The Commonwealth filed notice to consolidate Ms. Noland\u2019s trial and Appellant\u2019s trial. However, Ms. No-land became a Commonwealth witness and testified against Appellant. Just prior to Ms. Noland\u2019s testimony at Appellant\u2019s trial, the following comments were made to the jury.\nCourt: Before the next witness [Noland] is called, ladies and gentlemen, I\u2019ll advise you that I\u2019ve been advised by the Commonwealth that this witness, they [sic] will not be seeking either first degree or second degree murder. They will not be seeking a jury to convict her of either first or second degree murder.\nProsecutor: I think the record should reflect otherwise there is no agreement as to sentence as to the other offenses if she is convicted. But as to second and first degree murder, there is an agreement that the Commonwealth will not pursue those two charges.\nN.T. Trial, 4/13/96, at 208 (emphasis added).\nImmediately after these comments, Ms. Noland testified extensively as to her three-day crime spree with Appellant, directly impheating him as the one who shot and killed Ms. Gunnet. During cross-examination, Appellant repeatedly asked Ms. Noland if she was testifying in order to get \u201csome kind of deal\u201d with the Commonwealth, but she consistently denied any deal. Id. at 313-19. The essence of Appellant\u2019s defense was an attempt to place blame for the murder on Ms. Noland. Id. at 393. In his closing argument, Appellant returned to the matter of a \u201cdeal\u201d between Ms. Noland and the Commonwealth with the following comments:\nYou heard testimony which was a stipulation from the District Attorney\u2019s Office themselves that Christine Noland was never subjected to face the death penalties. That she was charged with criminal homicide which included first-, second-, and third-degree murder.\nThe [District [Attorney told you that they have dropped first-degree murder. They have dropped second-degree murder. The very most she can get is third-degree murder. Christine Noland doesn\u2019t have to worry about facing the death penalty or face spending the rest of her life in prison with no parole. She knows she is going to go home someday.\n* * *\nThe defense position is that the evidence shows Christine Noland\u2019s testimony isn\u2019t the truth. She testified so that she would not do life in exchange for gifts and favoritism from the [District [AJttorney. Despite the minor things, sneakers, necklaces, and going out to eat, the major deal was no death penalty, no life, no first-degree, no second-degree murder.\nThe testimony \u2014 her testimony is given so she can stay alive. The defense\u2019s position is that it\u2019s not hard to believe Christine Noland is putting this all on me so she can say this a[sic] \u2014 so she can stay alive or not do life in prison.\nN.T. Trial, 4/22/96, at 1926,1928-29 (footnotes added).\nAppellant was found guilty of first-degree murder in York County on April 22,1996. On June 20,1996, Ms. Noland pled guilty to kidnapping, robbery, and conspiracy to commit murder. Sentencing was set for August 12, 1996, but prior to sentencing, she sought to withdraw her guilty plea. The trial court granted her motion on April 28, 1997, and the Superior Court affirmed. Commonwealth v. Noland, 718 A.2d 346 (Pa.Super.1998).\nThe Commonwealth then restarted its efforts to bring Ms. Noland to trial, including on capital murder charges. See Commonwealth\u2019s Petition to File Notice of Aggravating Circumstances, dated 12/11/98 (Defendant\u2019s PCRA Exhibit 41). In this petition, the Commonwealth explained that it had not previously filed a notice of aggravating circumstances against Ms. Noland because of an agreement with her. The Commonwealth set forth the terms of this agreement as follows: \u201cThat in consideration of [Ms. Noland\u2019s] commitment to cooperate and testify against her co-defendant [Appellant], the Commonwealth did not seek the death penalty [against her] and agreed to accept pleas of guilty to lesser charges.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 7.\nFrom the facts of record summarized above, we conclude the following. (1) There was an agreement between the Commonwealth and Ms. Noland. (2) Pursuant to that agreement, the Commonwealth agreed not to prosecute Ms. Noland for first- or second-degree murder; and Ms. Noland agreed to testify against Appellant and plead guilty to lesser charges. (3) The prosecutor explicitly advised the jury of the Commonwealth\u2019s agreement not to pursue first- or second-degree murder charges. (4) The prosecutor also advised the jury that there was no agreement as to Ms. Noland\u2019s sentence for the other offenses with which she was charged. (5) Emphasizing the Commonwealth\u2019s agreement not to pursue first- or second-degree murder charges against Ms. Noland, Appellant strenuously argued that her testimony was given solely so that she could stay alive, not be subject to the death penalty, and not spend the rest of her life in prison.\nIn his brief to this Court, Appellant now asserts the following concerning the agreement between Ms. Noland and the Commonwealth: \u201cThe jury was never told that Noland had agreed to plead to lesser charges in exchange for her testimony. The clear implication left with the jury was that the prosecution had determined that these higher degrees of murder were not sustainable against Noland.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 26 (emphasis in original). With these assertions, Appellant misconstrues the record in at least two ways.\nFirst, Appellant simply ignores the prosecutor\u2019s clear statement to the jury that there was an agreement with Ms. Noland as to first- and second-degree murder charges: See N.T. Trial, 4/13/96, at 208 (\u201cBut as to second and first degree murder, there is an agreement that the Commonwealth will not pursue those two charges.\u201d) (emphasis added). The record thus completely belies Appellant\u2019s assertion that the jury was not clearly informed of the existence of an agreement between the Commonwealth and Ms. Noland. Appellant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor implied to the jury that murder charges were not sustainable against Ms. Noland is completely refuted by the prosecutor\u2019s statement of record.\nSecond, Appellant\u2019s focus on Ms. Noland\u2019s subsequent guilty pleas to lesser charges is misplaced, and his additional claim that the Commonwealth had agreed to seek lenient sentences for these lesser charges is completely unsupported by any evidence whatsoever. The only benefit accruing to Ms. No-land from her agreement with the Commonwealth was freedom from prosecution for first- or second-degree murder. In return, she agreed to testify against Appellant and to enter guilty pleas to lesser charges. The agreement between the Commonwealth and Ms. Noland encompassed the lesser charges only insofar as she agreed to plead guilty to them rather than be subject to trial. There is no evidence whatsoever that the Commonwealth ever agreed to forego prosecution of Ms. Noland for the lesser charges or had promised her a lenient sentence. Following Ms. Noland\u2019s trial testimony against Appellant, her guilty plea to lesser charges, and the court\u2019s grant of her request to withdraw those guilty pleas, the Commonwealth restarted its efforts to bring her to trial, including on capital murder charges. Appellant\u2019s convoluted and unsupported argument focusing on the significance of the lesser charges and the sentence for those charges is meritless.\nThus, in sum, we conclude as follows. There was an agreement between the Commonwealth and Ms. Noland, and the relevant terms of this agreement were announced in court in the presence of the jury. Furthermore, Appellant used the terms of the agreement in an attempt to impeach Ms. Noland. There is absolutely no merit to Appellant\u2019s claim of a Brady violation with regard to the agreement between the Commonwealth and Ms. Noland.\nIssue 3: Disclosure of Impeachment Evidence against Carlos/Charles Carothers\nIn Issue 3, Appellant raises a second Brady claim, this one concerning an alleged agreement between the Commonwealth and another witness for the prosecution, Carlos/Charles Carothers. The factual background to this claim is as follows. Mr. Carothers testified at Appellant\u2019s trial that he and Appellant met in Carlisle, in Cumberland County, early in the morning of February 3, 1995, the day after Ms. Gunnet was murdered. At that time, Mr. Carothers testified, Appellant stated that he \u201chad shot his brother and killed these other ladies,\u201d and \u201cthrew one lady off a bridge, and the other lady he ran over with her car and she got stuck under it.\u201d N.T. Trial, 4/16/96, at 1031. In addition, Carothers testified about a gun, ammunition, credit cards, rings, clothing, and cash in Appellant\u2019s possession, and about a wound on Appellant\u2019s leg. Id. at 1031-36,1039-40.\nThe prosecutor questioned Mr. Carothers about any possible plea deal as follows:\nProsecutor: Am I correct, Mr. Carothers, that you are currently incarcerated in Cumberland County Prison for a charge of possession of drugs with intent to deliver?\nCarothers: Delivery charge.\nProsecutor: Delivery of drugs?\nCarothers: Yes.\nProsecutor: Are you testifying today pursuant to the terms of any kind of plea agreement that you have with the County of York or the County of Cumberland?\nCarothers: No.\nProsecutor: Nobody has offered to give you any kind of deal in return for your testimony?\nCarothers: No.\nId. at 1038-39.\nAppellant claims that the above testimony was false, and that Mr. Carothers had made a \u201cdeal\u201d with the Commonwealth to avoid prosecution for two other murders, to wit, the murder of Betty Amstutz in Cumberland County, for which Appellant was ultimately convicted; and the unrelated murder of one Samuel \u201cDoc\u201d Thompson, for which another individual had been convicted two years before Appellant\u2019s arrest.,, Appellant\u2019s Brief at 30-31. To support these assertions, Appellant relies on Mr. Carothers\u2019s testimony at Appellant\u2019s PCRA hearing, during which Carothers recalled that when a detective investigating Appellant\u2019s case made reference at one point to the Thompson murder, it made him \u201cfeel nervous.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/11/08, at 483-84. However, Mr. Car-others also testified that he \u201cwasn\u2019t really concerned about [the Thompson murder case, which] was over and done with\u201d and for which he already had \u201ca deal in place.\u201d Id. at 485. Mr. Carothers also testified that the prosecutor in Appellant\u2019s case told him that if he was \u201ctruthful,\u201d then he would have \u201cnothing to worry about.\u201d Id. at 486. PCRA counsel pursued this line of questioning as follows:\nPCRA Counsel: Well, I am saying as long as you cooperate and tell us what you know, we won\u2019t bring any charges, is that how you understood?\nCarothers: I am not sure if the word was cooperation, but just to be forthcoming and honest maybe.\nId. at 486.\nAppellant also cites a document entitled Declaration of Charles Lee Carothers, Jr., dated 2/1/07, (Defense PCRA Exhibit 75) (hereinafter \u201cCarothers Declaration\u201d), as further support for his claim. This declaration was prepared by Appellant\u2019s PCRA counsel when he visited Mr. Carothers in prison, and it was signed by Mr. Carothers. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/11/08, at 481-82, 489-90. The declaration states that Carothers was nervous when the detectives mentioned the Thompson murder because Carothers \u201ctook it as a warning to cooperate in the Spotz case.\u201d Carothers Declaration at 2. In addition, the declaration states that the York County prosecutor told Carothers that so long as he cooperated and told the prosecutor what he knew, he would not be charged. Id. In his PCRA testimony, Carothers stated that he did not believe that he read the declaration before signing it. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/11/08, at 490. In addition, Carothers testified as follows with regard to the declaration.\nI don\u2019t remember actually reading [it]. I remember you [Appellant\u2019s PCRA counsel] asking me to sign it. I was under the impression that what you wanted me here for was to simply, you know, tell that [Appellant] was getting high. I didn\u2019t realize you were going to try to distort it or twist it to turn it, once again, back at me. So, I didn\u2019t think it was necessary to read what you wrote.\nId.\nMr. Carothers\u2019s testimony and the Carothers Declaration are the sum total of support that Appellant cites for his claim that the Commonwealth failed to disclose a \u201cdeal\u201d with Mr. Carothers, in violation of Brady. This evidence does not come close to establishing that there was an agreement between Mr. Carothers and the Commonwealth whereby Carothers agreed to testify against Appellant at trial and the Commonwealth agreed not to prosecute Carothers. Appellant\u2019s assertions of a deal are speculative and focus on relatively small inconsistencies between Carothers\u2019s testimony at the PCRA hearing and the Carothers Declaration, which Carothers signed but apparently did not read. Appellant has proffered no evidence that the Commonwealth entered into an agreement or made a deal in exchange for Carothers\u2019s testimony against Appellant. Because Appellant has not met his burden to establish that an agreement existed, his Brady claim based on the existence of such an agreement has no merit.\nIssue 4: Diminished Capacity Guilt-Phase Defenses\nIn Issue 4, Appellant asserts that his counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and develop the guilt-phase defense of diminished capacity due to mental defect or voluntary intoxication. In addition, as we discussed briefly under sub-issue 1(b), Appellant contends that his counsel\u2019s alleged failure to prepare this defense \u201cforced\u201d him to proceed pro se. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 20-21, 82-34. The PCRA court denied relief, crediting the testimony of trial counsel at the PCRA hearing and holding that there was no evidence to support a diminished capacity defense. PCRA Court Opinion at 13-14. The PCRA court specifically noted trial counsel\u2019s testimony that they did not recall Appellant informing them that he had used any drugs during the time of Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder. Finally, the PCRA court recognized that a diminished capacity defense was not available to Appellant because he maintained his innocence of the murder of Ms. Gunnet throughout trial. Id.\nWe have recently summarized the law relevant to the defense of diminished capacity due to mental defect or voluntary intoxication as follows:\nA defense of diminished capacity, whether grounded in mental defect or voluntary intoxication, is an extremely limited defense available only to those defendants who admit criminal liability but contest the degree of culpability based upon an inability to formulate the specific intent to kill. Absent an admission from the defendant that he had shot and killed the victim, trial counsel could not have presented a diminished capacity defense. If a defendant does not admit that he killed the victim, but rather advances an innocence defense, then evidence on diminished capacity is inadmissible.\nA diminished capacity defense does not exculpate the defendant from criminal liability entirely, but instead negates the element of specific intent. For a defendant who proves a diminished capacity defense, first-degree murder is mitigated to third-degree murder. To establish a diminished capacity defense, a defendant must prove that his cognitive abilities of deliberation and premeditation were so compromised, by mental defect or voluntary intoxication, that he was unable to formulate the specific intent to kill. The mere fact of intoxication does not give rise to a diminished capacity defense. [Rather, a defendant must] show that he was overwhelmed to the point of losing his faculties and sensibilities to prove a voluntary intoxication defense. Evidence that the defendant lacked the ability to control his or her actions or acted impulsively is irrelevant to specific intent to kill, and thus is not admissible to support a diminished capacity defense. Furthermore, diagnosis with a personality disorder does not suffice to establish diminished capacity.\nIn numerous prior cases before this Court, defendants who had maintained their innocence during trial have subsequently raised post-conviction claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to present and/or to investigate a defense of diminished capacity. We have consistently declined to hold that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to advance a defense that directly and irreconcilably conflicted with the accused\u2019s claims of innocence..... [Furthermore, as we have recently stated,] whether addressing a claim of counsel\u2019s failure to investigate or failure to present a diminished capacity defense, this Court has employed the same analysis.\nFinally, we have held that the authority to concede criminal liability and to authorize the presentation of a diminished capacity defense rests solely with the accused. [E]ven if diminished capacity [were] the only viable defense, trial counsel would be deemed ineffective for presenting this defense without the consent of the defendant ].\nCommonwealth v. Hutchinson, 611 Pa. 280, 25 A.3d 277, 312-13 (2011) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted) (emphasis in original).\nIn the instant case, this issue was the subject of extensive testimony at Appellant\u2019s PCRA hearing. To support his claim that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and develop a defense of diminished capacity due to voluntary intoxication, Appellant cites the PCRA testimony of numerous witnesses who presented evidence concerning his chronic and acute drug use, as we summarize in the paragraph below. It is important to emphasize that none of the witnesses who testified at the PCRA hearing actually saw Appellant or had information as to his drug use at the time of Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder, which is the only time that is relevant.\nFor example, Cindy Queen, the mother of one of Appellant\u2019s children, testified that Appellant was a chronic user of a variety of drugs, which left him irritable, moody, anxious, and changed from the caring and kind person that she knew; however, the last time she saw Appellant was three to four days prior to Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/17/07, at 242-47, 252. Another witness, Sheldon Brooks, testified that he saw Appellant, whom he did not know at the time, using cocaine at a \u201ccrack house\u201d in Carlisle beginning around 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. on the day of Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder. Id., 6/10/08, at 366-72. In Mr. Brooks\u2019s opinion, Appellant was \u201creally strung out\u201d that evening. Id. at 368. However, as we mentioned above, Ms. Gunnet was murdered early in the morning of February 2, 1995, so Brooks\u2019s observations were made at least thirteen or fourteen hours after the murder. Similarly, Charles/Carlos Carothers testified that he saw Appellant use cocaine repeatedly to get \u201chigh\u201d during the evening of February 2, 1995, and into the early morning hours of the next day. Id., 6/11/08, at 462-66, 493. Finally, Juan Maldanado, an acquaintance of Appellant\u2019s, testified that Appellant came to the parking lot where Mr. Maldanado worked in Harrisburg, \u201cabout 9:15 in the morning [-] sometime in the morning\u201d of February 2,1995. Id., 6/12/08, at 691-92, 694-95. Mr. Maldanado opined that Appellant appeared from his demeanor to be high on drugs; however, Maldanado had considerable difficulty explaining exactly what aspects of Appellant\u2019s demeanor or behavior led him to this conclusion. Mr. Maldanado did recall that Appellant was talking and walking; was able to climb over a seven-foot fence with Maldanado, even though he had wounds on the leg and shoulder; had Maldanado look at and help clean his shoulder wounds; and eventually departed by walking down the street. Id. at 696-97, 702-04. In addition, Mr. Maldanado testified that Appellant stated that he was wanted in Schuylkill County for murder and he showed Maldanado a gun, which, Appellant commented, was \u201cdropping them like flies.\u201d Id. at 704-05. Finally, Mr. Maldanado testified that Appellant also showed him some women\u2019s rings and credit cards that he was attempting to sell; Maldanado recalled that Appellant asked if Maldanado could find someone who could \u201cuse\u201d a woman\u2019s credit cards. Id. at 702-03.\nNone of this testimony remotely suggests that Appellant was at all intoxicated by drugs or alcohol at the time of Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder, much less that he was so intoxicated as to be overwhelmed to the point of losing his faculties and sensibilities and unable to formulate a specific intent to kill. See Hutchinson, supra. In fact, the testimony of Mr. Maldanado, who apparently saw Appellant a few hours after Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder, indicates that Appellant was sufficiently in control of his faculties and sensibilities to seek out and speak with Maldanado at his workplace; to get around on foot and climb over a seven-foot fence, despite his injuries; to try to get his wounds cleaned with Maldanado\u2019s help; to recall that he was wanted in Schuylkill County for murder via the use of a gun in his possession; to make a crude comment about how the gun had been used; and to attempt to sell women\u2019s rings and credit cards. Thus, the witnesses\u2019 testimony summarized above either is not relevant to a voluntary intoxication defense or actually refutes such a defense.\nBoth of Appellant\u2019s trial counsel, i.e., Mr. Blocher and Ms. Smith, testified at the PCRA hearing concerning their consideration of a diminished capacity defense, and nothing in their testimony suggests that they failed to investigate Appellant\u2019s drug use or possible mental defect as potential support for such a defense. When Ms. Smith was questioned as to whether she had taken statements concerning Appellant\u2019s drug use from the witnesses whose PCRA testimony is summarized sv/pra, she replied as follows:\nUnfortunately, these individuals were not all with him during the course of th[e] time frame [of the murder]. And so, we were limited on what they could actually say about the time frame of the shooting....\nN.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/10/08, at 305-06.\nAlthough Ms. Smith and Mr. Blocher did not have a precise or completely consistent recollection as to what Appellant himself had told them about his drug and alcohol use during the time frame of the murders, see id. at 289-91; id., 9/17/07, at 196-97, 199, 216, their testimony indicates that they investigated the possibility of an involuntary intoxication defense sufficiently to realize that there was no evidentiary support for such a defense.\nPrior to trial, defense counsel had retained Dr. Ragusea as a psychologist expert witness, and Mr. Blocher testified that Appellant\u2019s possible mental health defects or diseases were \u201cthe kinds of things [that] we were looking for.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/17/07, at 104, 235. Ms. Smith testified that conversations with Dr. Ragusea indicated that there was insufficient evidence to raise diminished capacity even as a mitigating factor, much less as a guilt-phase defense. Id., 6/9/08, at 209-10; id., 6/10/08, at 286-87. In addition, Ms. Smith did not recall any time at which Appellant had indicated that he suffered from any kind of hallucinations or flashbacks, or that he had any untreated mental illness. Id., 6/10/08, at 295-96.\nDefense counsel testified that they had discussed possible defenses with Appellant, including a diminished capacity defense, and that Appellant supported the decision to try to shift blame for the murder onto Christina Noland, a defense that Appellant ultimately employed during his self-representation. Id. at 287-91; id., 9/17/07, at 196-97, 216. Thus, defense counsel\u2019s testimony lends no support to Appellant\u2019s assertion of counsel ineffectiveness for failing to investigate a diminished capacity defense.\nFinally, Appellant attempts to rely on the testimony of two psychiatrists, Dr. Fox and Dr. Blumberg, who were retained by PCRA counsel to evaluate Appellant. Dr. Fox, who evaluated Appellant in 2000 and 2007, respectively five and twelve years after the murders, opined that, at the time of the murders, Appellant was unable to formulate a specific intent to kill due to a combination of his post-traumatic stress disorder and his substance abuse. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/9/08, at 112-14. Dr. Blumberg, who evaluated Appellant in 2006, eleven years after the murders, did not testify specifically as to Appellant\u2019s ability to formulate intent. Dr. Blumberg set forth the abusive circumstances of Appellant\u2019s childhood, and opined that, at the time of Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder, Appellant was suffering from three psychiatric conditions, to wit, post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic/severe; personality disorder not otherwise specified with dependent schizotypal borderline and anti-social features; and polysubstance abuse, including marijuana, LSD, cocaine, and methamphetamine. Id., 9/17/07, at 315-16. However, Dr. Blumberg did not opine that, at the time of Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder or any other time, Appellant was unable to formulate the specific intent to kill or was overwhelmed to the point of losing his faculties and sensibilities. In fact, on cross-examination, Dr. Blumberg testified as follows:\nI\u2019m not specifically correlating [Appellant\u2019s] significant impairment and judgment, impulse, control, mood and affect necessarily to the three other killings [i.e., of Ms. Ohlinger, Ms. Gunnet, and Ms. Amstutz]. I don\u2019t know what the impact \u2014 you know, what impact that might or might not have had.\nId. at 462.\nWith regard to Appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the murders, Dr. Blumberg opined only as follows: \u201c... in my opinion, the combination of [Appellant\u2019s mental] disorders represents an extreme mental or emotional disturbance that was present at the time [of Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder].\u201d Id. at 440. An \u201cextreme mental or emotional disturbance\u201d does not in any factual or legal sense equate to an inability to formulate intent, and thus cannot support the advancement of a diminished capacity defense.\n\u2022 After thorough review of all the evidence proffered by Appellant to support his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and develop a defense of diminished capacity, we conclude that the PCRA court did not abuse its discretion in declining to grant relief on this claim. The only evidence cited by Appellant that actually supports the viability of a defense grounded in diminished capacity due to mental defect is one excerpt of the testimony of Dr. Fox, a psychiatrist who evaluated Appellant years after the murders. See text, supra. The testimony of Dr. Blumberg lends no support to such a defense, nor does the testimony of any other witness relied upon by Appellant, as we have explained. Furthermore, Appellant fails to recognize or contemplate that the evidence presented at trial strongly indicates that, at the time of Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder, Appellant was able to formulate the intent to evade the authorities, who he knew were seeking him in connection with a prior homicide; to steal a car from Ms. Gunnet and drive to a remote area with her as a passenger; to take Ms. Gunnet\u2019s cash, as well as her credit cards and rings, which he attempted to sell; to drive away rapidly in her vehicle after firing three shots; and, within hours after the murder, to seek out and find an acquaintance for assistance with his wounds. Finally, Appellant has never admitted that he killed Ms. Gunnet, not at trial, where he attempted to shift blame for the murder onto Ms. Noland, nor in this collateral appeal, where he continues to attempt to implicate Ms. No-land. All of this evidence of Appellant\u2019s directed, intentional, goal-oriented activity at or near the time of the murder argues strongly against his current assertion that diminished capacity would have been a viable guilt-phase defense had counsel only done further investigation.\nThus, after thorough review of the entire record, we conclude that Appellant\u2019s claim of counsel ineffectiveness for failing to investigate or develop a defense of diminished capacity due to voluntary intoxication or mental defect has no arguable merit. Accordingly, Appellant is entitled to no relief on his fourth issue.\nIssue 5: Guilt-Phase Jury Instructions\nAppellant asserts that the trial court erred with respect to its guilt-phase jury instructions in the following two ways: (a) by informing the jury of the maximum possible sentences for first-, second-, and third-degree murder; and (b) by failing to instruct the jury that evidence of prior bad acts can be used only for a limited purpose. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 34-37. The PCRA court denied relief, concluding these claims of trial court error had been waived or previously litigated. PCRA Court Opinion at 5-6 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9544(b) and 9543(a)(3)). We address each sub-issue in turn.\nWith regard to sub-issue (a), the alleged trial court error has been waived pursuant to subsection 9544(b), because Appellant did not raise a timely objection. However, waiver does not totally resolve this sub-issue because Appellant also asserts that counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the jury instruction and for not raising the matter on direct appeal. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 34-37. In raising this ineffectiveness claim, Appellant has not fully appreciated the consequences of his self-representation during the guilt phase of his trial. As this Court has held on several occasions, when an appellant knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently has chosen to exercise his right to self-representation, he cannot obtain relief by raising his own ineffectiveness or that of standby counsel. Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 270; Commonwealth v. Fletcher, 604 Pa. 493, 986 A.2d 759, 774, 778 (2009) (\u201cFletcher III \u201d); Commonwealth v. Fletcher, 586 Pa. 527, 896 A.2d 508, 522 n. 13 (2006) (\u201cFletcher II \u201d); Commonwealth v. Bryant, 579 Pa. 119, 855 A.2d 726, 736-38 (2004). Here, Appellant chose to represent himself during the guilt phase of trial; accordingly, pursuant to our established precedent, we will not entertain his claim of ineffectiveness of standby counsel for failure to object to the guilt-phase jury instructions.\nWith regard to sub-issue (b), the alleged trial court error was raised on direct appeal, at which time this Court concluded as follows:\n[T]he trial court properly instructed the jury that it could only consider the other crimes evidence for its relevant limited purposes and not merely as evidence of [A]ppellant\u2019s propensity to commit crimes. For this additional reason, no relief is due.\nSpotz II, 756 A.2d at 1153. Thus, the trial court error alleged in sub-issue (b) has been previously litigated and, as such, is not cognizable under the PCRA, pursuant to subsection 9543(a)(3). Because we have previously concluded that Appellant\u2019s claim of trial court error in sub-issue (b) is meritless, his derivative claim of counsel ineffectiveness is also meritless.\nIn sum, Appellant is entitled to no relief on either of his sub-issues in Issue 5.\nIssue 6: Prosecutorial Misconduct\nIn Issue 6, Appellant raises the following eight allegations of prosecutorial misconduct: (a) the prosecutor physically touched and verbally harassed Appellant during the trial; (b) the prosecutor used biblical references to support the death penalty and minimize mitigation factors; (c) the prosecutor improperly argued that the jury had a duty to return a death sentence; (d) the prosecutor injected emotion, passion, and prejudice into the jury\u2019s sentencing determination by referring to the family of the victim; (e) the prosecutor misrepresented facts of Appellant\u2019s prior burglary convictions and elicited testimony concerning other burglaries for which Appellant had been investigated but not arrested; (f) the prosecutor improperly stated that the jury\u2019s guilt-phase verdict had proven the 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6) aggravating factor (killing committed during the perpetration of a felony); (g) the prosecutor injected his personal opinion as to the severity of abuse and dysfunction in Appellant\u2019s childhood home; and (h) the prosecutor improperly argued that a death sentence was appropriate as retaliation for women in general, as well as for the victim. In addition, Appellant asserts a generalized claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct and/or to raise it on direct appeal. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 37-45.\nThe PCRA court did not specifically address most of Appellant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct, apparently finding them waived or previously litigated. See PCRA Court Opinion at 5-6. One exception is Appellant\u2019s claim of verbal and physical intimidation by the prosecutor, which the PCRA court expressly found meritless, although with little explanation other than the determination that Appellant had received a fair trial. The PCRA court also summarily rejected Appellant\u2019s claim as to burglary convictions as an aggravating factor, citing the decision from this Court denying Appellant\u2019s Schuylkill County collateral appeal. Id. at 20 (citing Spotz V, 896 A.2d at 1240-42).\nBefore addressing each of Appellant\u2019s specific claims of prosecutorial misconduct and his derivative claims of ineffective assistance, we set forth the legal principles relevant to our review:\n[A] claim of ineffective assistance grounded in counsel\u2019s failure to object to a prosecutor\u2019s comments may succeed when the petitioner demonstrates that the prosecutor\u2019s comments violated a constitutionally or statutorily protected right, such as the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination or the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial, or a constitutional interest such as due process. Commonwealth v. Cox, 603 Pa. 223, 983 A.2d 666, 685 (2009) (quoting Commonwealth v. Tedford, 598 Pa. 639, 960 A.2d 1, 29 (2008)). To constitute a due process violation, the prosecutorial misconduct must be of sufficient significance to result in the denial of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. Cox, supra at 685 (quoting Greer v. Miller, 483 U.S. 756, 765, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987)). The touchstone is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor. Id.\nA prosecutor may make fair comment on the admitted evidence and may provide fair rebuttal to defense arguments. Id. at 687. Even an otherwise improper comment may be appropriate if it is in fair response to defense counsel\u2019s remarks. Id. Any challenge to a prosecutor\u2019s comment must be evaluated in the context in which the comment was made. Id. During closing argument in the penalty phase, a prosecutor must be afforded reasonable latitude, and permitted to employ oratorical flair when arguing in favor of the death penalty. Commonwealth v. Stokes, 576 Pa. 299, 839 A.2d 226, 231-32 (2003). It is not improper for the prosecutor to urge the jury to view the defense\u2019s mitigation evidence with disfavor and thus to impose the death penalty. Id. at 233.\nNot every unwise, intemperate, or improper remark made by a prosecutor mandates the grant of a new trial[.] Reversible error occurs only when the unavoidable effect of the challenged comments would prejudice the jurors and form in their minds a fixed bias and hostility toward the defendant such that the jurors could not weigh the evidence and render a true verdict. Cox, supra at 687 (citation omitted); see also Commonwealth v. Carson, 590 Pa. 501, 913 A.2d 220, 242 (2006).\nSpotz VI, 18 A.3d at 288 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nIn sub-issue 6(a), Appellant asserts that H. Stanley Rebert, who was the York County District Attorney and primary prosecutor at Appellant\u2019s trial, intimidated him verbally and physically, allegedly denying Appellant his rights to a fair trial and to self-representation. Appellant cites the following three incidents in support of this claim, all of which took place during the guilt phase of trial when Appellant was acting pro se. First, during a discussion of trial exhibits, conducted outside the presence of the jury near the beginning of the trial, Mr. Rebert apparently touched Appellant. Second, six days later, immediately after the court, on its own initiative, conferred with a juror as to her ability to continue to pay attention to the testimony, Appellant complained to the court about the prosecutor\u2019s aggressive behavior as follows:\nAppellant: I\u2019d like to state Mr. Rebert has been aggressive to me. All these security measures are because of my aggressiveness to him. He put his hand on me, tried to push me. He\u2019s putting his hands in my face and hollering at me.\nCourt: Let the record show they are not in the presence of the jury. So what the two of you want to do is up to you.\nMr. Rebert: Your Honor, the reason that I have reacted in the manner that I did was because [Appellant] made a comment to me asking me if I was the one that asked [the questioned juror] in for this conference. My reaction to that was, he was simply trying to put out to the jury that was the case and in some way affect the juror. That was the reason for my reaction. I suspect he will not deny he said that as the juror was walking by. I want the record to reflect that.\nAppellant: Let the record reflect the woman was sitting in the seat beside Mr. Rebert. I simply asked, did you call her in? It\u2019s bizarre to even suggest that I did it to prejudice the jury against the Commonwealth.\nCourt: The answer to the question, Mr. Rebert, would have been [ ] no, [the court] did. And I would have been happy to tell the juror that, so we don\u2019t run into any problems with regard to that.\nN.T. Trial, 4/18/96, at 1335-36.\nThird, on the same day, just after one of the defense witnesses invoked her Fifth Amendment right not to testify, Appellant stated the following:\nAppellant: You got one more chance to do some stupid shit to me, Mr. Rebert. Just so you know, I\u2019m not going to keep going with all the bullshit. I\u2019ve been doing something \u2014 I\u2019m going to keep trying to be cool. I\u2019m not going for no more of this throwing things at me, pushing me, screaming in my face one more time. I\u2019m not going for it one more time, one more time.\nCourt: Just so the record will reflect, the jury is not present to hear the statement of [Appellant].\nId. at 1449-50. There is no indication from the record as to what specific action by Mr. Rebert prompted Appellant\u2019s above-quoted statement.\nAppellant relies on the PCRA testimony of his trial counsel, Ms. Smith, who testified that she heard Mr. Rebert and Appellant arguing in the courtroom and that Mr. Rebert touched or pushed Appellant, in violation of the rules set forth by the sheriff who was responsible for security. N.T. PCRA, 6/9/08, at 203-05. Appellant then simply asserts, without argument or any development, that \u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was clearly designed to deny Appellant [ ] his right to a fair trial and his right to self-representation and violated Appellant\u2019s Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 38. Appellant has failed to set forth any evidence that his right to a fair trial, his right to self-representation, or any other Sixth or Eighth Amendment right was compromised by the prosecutor\u2019s conduct. Our focus is on the fairness of Appellant\u2019s trial, not on the culpability of the prosecutor. See, e.g., Spotz VI, supra at 288 (citing Commonwealth v. Cox, 603 Pa. 223, 983 A.2d 666, 685 (2009)). The incidents that Appellant cites, all of which we have set forth verbatim from the record, see supra, were brief and out of the presence of the jury. We fail to see how they might have affected Appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial or his right to self-representation. There is no merit to Appellant\u2019s first claim of prosecutorial misconduct, and thus appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise this claim on direct appeal.\nIn sub-issue 6(b), Appellant claims that the prosecutor improperly used two biblical references to argue during the penalty phase for a sentence of death and to minimize mitigation factors. First, Appellant cites the following excerpt of his mother\u2019s cross-examination by the prosecutor, which took place shortly after she had testified on direct examination that Appellant \u201calways believed in God [and] has always had great respect for Christianity.\u201d N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 138.\nMr. Rebert: You indicated that ... one of your son Mark\u2019s characteristics was great respect for Christianity?\nMother: Yes.\nMr. Rebert: Are you at all familiar with the Ten Commandments?\nMother: Yes.\nDefense Counsel: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object.\nCourt: Sustained.\nMr. Rebert: Your Honor, cross examination. She talks about Christianity. There are certain things you\u2019re supposed to do and not supposed to do. If he\u2019s so familiar\u2014\nCourt: The objection is sustained, Mr. Rebert. Continue.\nId. at 146.\nBased on this exchange, Appellant asserts that his Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated, relying on this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Chambers, 528 Pa. 558, 599 A.2d 630, 643^4 (1991), which, as we discuss immediately below, was decided based on state law. In Chambers, supra at 643, the prosecutor included the following statement in his closing argument: \u201cKarl Chambers has taken a life. As the Bible says, \u2018and the murderer shall be put to death.\u2019 \u201d We concluded that the prosecutor had interjected religious law .as an additional, improper factor for the jury\u2019s consideration, leading to the possibility that the death sentence imposed was the product of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary factor. Therefore, based on this Commonwealth\u2019s capital sentencing statute, which carefully and specifically delineates all the factors that a jury must consider when determining whether the death penalty is appropriate, we vacated the appellant\u2019s sentence of death and remanded for a new sentencing hearing. Id. at 644. Chambers also included a strong admonition that \u201creliance in any manner upon the Bible or any other religious writing in support of the imposition of a penalty of death is reversible error per se. \u201d Id.\nHowever, our holding in Chambers does not preclude a prosecutor from making fair response when the defense raises arguments of a religious nature. For example, in Commonwealth v. Brown, 551 Pa. 465, 711 A.2d 444, 457-58 (1998), wherein we discussed and applied the holding in Chambers, we explicitly considered whether the fair response doctrine was applicable. Although we concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s unmistakable reference to specific biblical passages necessitated a new sentencing hearing, we also noted that our review of the entire record led us to conclude that the biblical reference at issue in Brown could not be considered a fair response to a defense argument. Brown, supra at 458 n. 11. We contrasted Brown\u2019s circumstances with those in Commonwealth v. Whitney, 511 Pa. 282, 512 A.2d 1152, 1159-60 (1986), wherein we held that a prosecutor\u2019s biblical invocation of the \u201cPrince of Darkness\u201d was permissible because it was responsive to the arguments of defense counsel. Brown, supra at 456 (discussing Whitney, supra). Thus, we do not interpret Chambers or Brown to bar a prosecutor from making fair response to the defense\u2019s religious arguments.\nHere, the defense opened the matter of Appellant\u2019s religious philosophy by eliciting testimony that Appellant had \u201cgreat respect for Christianity.\u201d N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 138. Pursuant to the fair response doctrine, the prosecutor could properly probe the depths of Appellant\u2019s respect for and understanding of that religious tradition. However, the defense objected to the line of questioning, and the trial court granted the objection. The prosecutor did not commit any misconduct, and Appellant\u2019s undeveloped derivative claim that counsel was somehow ineffective in raising this matter is likewise meritless.\nThe second biblical reference cited by Appellant was made by the prosecutor in his closing argument. Specifically, after acknowledging that Appellant had a troubled childhood, the prosecutor then commented that Appellant \u201cbecame a man and put away childish things\u201d long before the murders. N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 371. Appellant challenged this same statement on direct appeal, and argued there, as he does here, that the prosecutor was invoking a specific biblical passage, to wit, I Corinthians 13:11, to argue against Appellant\u2019s proffered mitigating factor of a troubled childhood. Spotz II, 756 A.2d at 1164-65. We rejected Appellant\u2019s challenge on direct appeal, distinguishing it from Chambers and Brown. Here, Appellant merely re-raises the same claim, which is not cognizable under the PCRA because it has been previously litigated. Thus, Appellant is entitled to no relief.\nIn sub-issues 6(c) and (d), Appellant challenges portions of the prosecutor\u2019s penalty-phase closing argument in which he argued in favor of sentencing Appellant to death. The relevant excerpt, with the challenged portions emphasized, is as follows.\nWe spent a lot of time on this case----I\u2019d like to think that you\u2019ve seen the best York County has to offer. I\u2019d like to thank Mrs. Fawcett [the other prosecutor]. I\u2019d like to thank the police officers. I\u2019d like to thank this entire county for their help in prosecuting [Appellant].\nIt\u2019s been difficult for us and difficult for [Appellant]. It\u2019s been difficult for you, but the most difficult task is yet to be accomplished and that is for you to sit in judgment on the fate of [Appellant]. His life is quite literally in your hands.\nThe Commonwealth submits that [Appellant] deserves to die. The law permits it, the Commonwealth seeks it, Penny Gurnet\u2019s family demands it.\nThe [c]ourt will instruct you as to what standards are to be used in this determination. You are sworn as jurors and you took an oath[;] and when you were asked questions during the voir dire process[] you indicated that you could impose the death penalty[J and you would impose the death penalty if the circumstances warranted and the Commonwealth met its burden of proof. The Commonwealth will be holding you to that oath, ladies and gentlemen. The task before you, as I also said when we talked earlier, is awesome indeed and one that will not likely be shared by any of us and very few other people.\n[Here follows brief general remarks about aggravating and mitigating circumstances]\nThe Commonwealth will be presenting a number of aggravating circumstances.\nA life for a life is not the law in Pennsylvania. It is only when the Commonwealth can establish certain aggravating circumstances that we can even request that the death penalty be imposed.\nN.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 363-65 (emphasis added to the challenged portions, as cited in Appellant\u2019s Brief at 40-41).\nIn sub-issue 6(c), Appellant asserts that the prosecutor violated the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments by arguing that the community supported the imposition of a death sentence and that it was the jury\u2019s duty to impose such a sentence. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 40. Taking the prosecutor\u2019s comments here as a whole and in context, as we must, it is clear that Appellant\u2019s assertions of misconduct are meritless. The prosecutor\u2019s comments emphasize that the jury \u2014 and the jury alone \u2014 must decide whether Appellant should be sentenced to death. Thanking those who aided Appellant\u2019s prosecution does not in any way imply a diminution of the jury\u2019s responsibility in this regard. Nor is the prosecutor\u2019s clear statement of the jury\u2019s responsibility diminished or qualified by the unremarkable and obvious oratorical assertion that the Commonwealth seeks the death penalty. (Appellant\u2019s claims as to the prosecutor\u2019s statement that the victim\u2019s family demands death are addressed in the next sub-issue.) The prosecutor\u2019s harkening back to voir dire merely recalls for the jurors their oath to apply the law of this Commonwealth. Appellant\u2019s assertions of misconduct are grounded in a reading of the above-reproduced excerpt that is unreasonable based on the plain text of the argument. No relief is due.\nIn sub-issue (d), Appellant asserts that the prosecutor injected emotion, passion, and prejudice into the jury\u2019s sentencing determination by stating that \u201c[the victim\u2019s] family demands [a death sentence].\u201d N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 363 (quoted in context in the text immediately above).\nAs this Court has often stated, \u201c[c]omments by a prosecutor do not constitute reversible error unless their unavoidable effect was to prejudice the jury, forming in [the jurors\u2019] minds a fixed bias and hostility toward the defendant such that they could not weigh the evidence objectively and render a true penalty determination.\u201d Commonwealth v. Paddy, 609 Pa. 272, 15 A.3d 431, 458 (2011) (citation omitted); see also Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 288 (expressing same principle). During closing argument of a capital sentencing hearing, the prosecutor is permitted by statute to present argument in favor of the sentence of death. Paddy, supra at 459; Commonwealth v. Tedford, 598 Pa. 639, 960 A.2d 1, 49 (2008) (citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(a)(3)). This Court has recognized that some part of the rationale for a death sentence involves retribution, and we have declined to hold that a prosecutor\u2019s comments were improper merely because he suggested in an exercise of rhetorical flair the appropriateness of this rationale. Commonwealth v. Whitney, 511 Pa. 232, 512 A.2d 1152, 1157-59 (1986).\nHere, Appellant challenges one sentence in a string of three short sentences obviously put together for rhetorical flair: \u201cThe law permits it [sentencing Appellant to death]; the Commonwealth seeks it; Penny Gunnet\u2019s family demands it.\u201d N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 363 (emphasis added to portion cited by Appellant in his Brief at 40). While it is obvious that the \u201cdemands\u201d of a victim\u2019s family would be an improper sentencing consideration, it cannot be considered surprising \u2014 to the court or to the jury \u2014 that a murder victim\u2019s family might want to see their loved one\u2019s killer suffer the ultimate punishment. The jury here was told repeatedly and graphically that it and it alone bore the responsibility to determine Appellant\u2019s sentence. See, e.g., N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 363 (where the prosecutor told the jury that \u201c[Appellant\u2019s] life is quite literally in your hands\u201d); id. at 397 (where the court instructed the jury that \u201c[y]ou are the ones who decide the sentence of either death or life imprisonment\u201d). We cannot conclude that the four-word sentence challenged by Appellant, which was added for rhetorical flair, so prejudiced the jurors that they formed in their minds a fixed bias and hostility toward the defendant and were unable to weigh the evidence and render a fair verdict. See Spotz VI, supra at 288, and citations therein. Hence, Appellant\u2019s claim of prosecutorial misconduct and his derivative claim of counsel ineffectiveness for failing to object to this statement fail.\nIn sub-issue 6(e), Appellant claims that the prosecutor misrepresented facts of Appellant\u2019s prior burglary convictions during closing argument in support of the aggravating circumstance of significant history of violent felony convictions. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9). Appellant asserts, without benefit of argument, that the prosecutor\u2019s comments violated Appellant\u2019s Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\nWe first note the following relevant legal principles. Burglary is a crime of violence as a matter of law, and a defendant\u2019s prior burglary convictions are properly admitted as evidence of a significant history of violent felony convictions pursuant to subsection 9711(d)(9). Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 284-85 (citing Commonwealth v. Small, 602 Pa. 425, 980 A.2d 549, 576-77 (2009); Commonwealth v. Bracey, 541 Pa. 322, 662 A.2d 1062,1075 n. 15 (1995); Commonwealth v. Rolan, 520 Pa. 1, 549 A.2d 553, 559 (1988)); Spotz V, 896 A.2d at 1241. The fact that a defendant\u2019s specific burglaries did not involve violence does not preclude their use to satisfy aggravating circumstance 9711(d)(9). Spotz VI, supra at 284-85; Spotz V, supra at 1241.\nHere, at the beginning of the penalty phase of Appellant\u2019s trial, the Commonwealth introduced Appellant\u2019s three 1990 Cumberland County burglary convictions to support the subsection 9711(d)(9) aggravating factor. N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 16-17. Then, during closing argument, while discussing this aggravating factor, the following exchange took place:\nProsecutor: The second aggravating circumstance, ladies and gentlemen, is that [Appellant] has a significant history of felony convictions involving violence or the threat of violence to the person.... The record reflected during the course of the testimony that [Appellant] was convicted of robbery in Cumberland County, conspiracy to commit robbery in Cumberland County, robbery in Cumberland County, three counts of burglary in Cumberland County.\n* * %\nBurglary----Burglary is a crime of violence. Perhaps the most frightening thing that can happen ... one of the most frightening things that can happen is a man intruding or a woman intruding into your house.\nDefense Counsel: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object at this point. There was no testimony about the nature of the burglaries at all.\nProsecutor: Burglary is a burglary.\nDefense Counsel: Was it a home? Was it a building?\nProsecutor: It was a home. It was a building.\nDefense Counsel: It was never testified there was anyone\u2019s home [sic]\u2014\nCourt: That\u2019s true. Burglary is, as you know, under the law[,] entering a building without lawful right or being invited to commit a crime in the building, but no one needs to be there for burglary. Just so the jury understands that. As far as commenting as to the evidence or the factual circumstances surrounding the offenses, I would suggest counsel not refer to those since that wasn\u2019t given to the jury nor will it be given.\nProsecutor: Your Honor, may I say that the burglary is considered a crime of violence as it\u2019s defined by the law?\nCourt: Yes, you can. That is the law.\nN.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 365-68.\nThe trial court correctly determined that burglary is a crime of violence as a matter of law, and that a defendant\u2019s prior burglary convictions are properly admitted as evidence of a significant history of violent felony convictions pursuant to subsection 9711(d)(9). In addition, following defense counsel\u2019s objection, the trial court properly cautioned the prosecutor not to argue factual details of Appellant\u2019s burglary convictions that had not been presented to the jury. From our review of the notes of testimony, we conclude that there was nothing in the prosecutor\u2019s brief and general comments about the crime of burglary that could have so prejudiced the jury against Appellant that it was unable to weigh the evidence and reach a fair verdict. See Spotz VI, supra at 288, and citations therein. Accordingly, we conclude that there was no prosecutorial misconduct.\nIn the second part of this sub-issue, Appellant alleges that the prosecutor \u201celicited testimony that Appellant had been investigated \u2014 but not arrested or convicted \u2014 for 53 additional burglaries.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 42. Appellant refers specifically to the following portion of the penalty-phase examination of Commonwealth witness Gerald Henneman, a retired state trooper who had investigated the burglaries that led to Appellant\u2019s 1990 convictions. The Commonwealth called Mr. Henneman to identify Appellant as the individual who had been convicted of those burglaries, and started its examination of Mr. Henneman as follows.\nProsecutor: In 1989, did you conduct an investigation that resulted in three charges of burglary being filed against [Appellant] ... ?\nWitness: Yes, Ma\u2019am. I conducted 53 investigations.\nDefense Counsel: Your Honor, I\u2019m going to object to that.\nCourt: Just stick to the responses to the questions, Officer.\nWitness: Yes, sir.\nN.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 21-22.\nThe record, including the above excerpts from the notes of testimony, lends no support to Appellant\u2019s assertion that the prosecutor \u201celicited\u201d testimony that Appellant had been investigated in 53 additional burglaries. When asked if he had conducted the investigation that led to three burglary charges being filed against Appellant, the witness volunteered that he had conducted 53 investigations, although it remained unclear whether all these investigations were related or involved Appellant. We conclude that nothing about this brief and vague exchange could have so prejudiced the jury that it was unable to weigh the evidence and reach a fair verdict. Thus, there was no prosecutorial misconduct.\nWhile Appellant recognizes that trial counsel objected to both of the prosecutor\u2019s statements challenged in this sub-issue, Appellant contends that trial counsel was ineffective for not seeking a curative instruction in each case. We cannot conclude that Appellant was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to request curative instructions with respect to the brief, vague, and general statements challenged here, particularly in the context of Appellant\u2019s lengthy history of violent felony convictions. The Commonwealth presented undisputed evidence that Appellant\u2019s history of violent felony convictions included the following: in Cumberland County, three burglary convictions, two robbery convictions, and one criminal conspiracy conviction, all in mid-1990; in Franklin County, one robbery conviction, in July 1990; in Clearfield County, one voluntary manslaughter conviction, in the death of Dustin Spotz, in 1995; in Schuylkill County, a first-degree murder conviction, as well as convictions for kidnapping, robbery, aggravated assault, and robbery of a motor vehicle, in March 1996. See N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 16-59. Given this undisputed lengthy history of violent felonies, there is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different but for counsel\u2019s failure to request curative instructions with respect to the brief, vague, and general comments of which Appellant complains. See Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 284-87 (citing Appellant\u2019s lengthy record of violent felony convictions in holding that he did not suffer prejudice from counsel\u2019s failure to object to a brief remark by the prosecutor about Appellant\u2019s burglary convictions). Counsel was not ineffective, and Appellant is entitled to no relief.\nIn sub-issue 6(f), Appellant asserts that the prosecutor improperly told the jury that its guilt-phase verdict constituted proof of aggravating circumstance 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6), killing committed during the perpetration of a felony. Specifically, Appellant challenges the following statements by the prosecutor during his penalty phase closing argument.\nFirst aggravating circumstance that the Commonwealth submits for your consideration is the fact that the killing was committed in the perpetration of a felony.\nYour burden is to find that circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt. And to a degree, to a large degree, to the ultimate degree, you have already made that determination. You have found [Appellant] guilty of murder in the first degree, kidnapping, robbery of a motor vehicle, and robbery. That determination is in the bank.\nN.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 365.\nAppellant contends that, with this argument, the Commonwealth relieved itself of its obligation to prove every element of this aggravating circumstance. Appellant\u2019s assertion is entirely untenable. The prosecutor stated that the aggravating circumstance was submitted for the jury\u2019s \u201cconsideration\u201d and that the standard of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d was applicable. The prosecutor then argued in favor of this aggravating factor based on the jury\u2019s guilt-phase verdict, using rhetorical flair that remained well within acceptable boundaries. There was no prosecutorial misconduct.\nFurthermore, the trial court gave clear instructions to the jury regarding the proof of aggravating factors in general and factor 9711(d)(6) in particular.\nWith regard again to the aggravating circumstances, they must be proved to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt.\nIn this case, the Commonwealth has set forth for your consideration the following aggravating circumstances: [Appellant] committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony. A felony under the law could be kidnapping or robbery either of personal property or an automobile. You would have to be satisfied from the evidence that you have already heard that the killing did occur while [Appellant] was committing such an offense.\nN.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 398-99.\nWe presume that the jury follows the court\u2019s instructions, and the instructions here were clear. Appellant\u2019s derivative claim of ineffectiveness of counsel in this sub-issue has no arguable merit.\nIn sub-issue 6(g), Appellant asserts that Mr. Rebert, the chief prosecutor, injected his personal opinion as to the severity of the abuse and dysfunction in Appellant\u2019s childhood home, thereby violating Appellant\u2019s Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 42-43. Appellant specifically cites the following excerpt of the penalty phase cross-examination of Molly Muir, the Clearfield County Children and Youth Services (\u201cCYS\u201d) administrator who had been called to testify as to the agency\u2019s contact with Appellant and his family.\nMr. Rebert: But I mean as far as the Newpher residence [Appellant\u2019s childhood home] was concerned[,] there was never a time that Children and Youth exercised one of their emergency orders to get those kids out of the Newpher residence?\nWitness: Correct.\nMr. Rebert: So it wasn\u2019t so bad that you had to file one of those emergency petitions, correct?\nWitness: It would appear that way.\nMr. Rebert: You work with a lot of kids, don\u2019t you?\nWitness: Yes. And the reason that I\u2019m having difficulty answering that is because standards have changed through the years. So what might be different now \u2014 how we might deal with something differently now than what was dealt with back then, but the Agency didn\u2019t take any of those kinds of actions back then.\nMr. Rebert: Well, I was solicitor for that Agency about the same time you\u2019re talking about so how have they changed?\nWitness: Community standards.... [C]ommunity standards kind of dictate how often an agency is going to take some actions with different families.\nN.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 212-13.\nContrary to Appellant\u2019s assertion, these excerpts of testimony do not indicate that Mr. Rebert injected his personal opinion and experience to challenge Ms. Muir\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor was certainly trying to probe the severity of the dysfunction and abuse in Appellant\u2019s childhood home by focusing on the agency\u2019s apparent failure to remove the children via an emergency order. This was a proper line of questioning, and the prosecutor did not inject his opinion into Ms. Muir\u2019s answers, including her response that standards had changed over the years. The prosecutor\u2019s passing comment that he was solicitor for the agency may have been unnecessary, but it does not constitute an opinion. There is no merit to Appellant\u2019s assertion of prosecutorial misconduct or his derivative claim of counsel ineffectiveness.\nIn sub-issue 6(h), the final sub-issue in Issue 6, Appellant claims that the prosecutor improperly argued that a death sentence was appropriate as retaliation both for the victim and for women in general, in violation of Appellant\u2019s Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Appellant specifically cites the following comments by the prosecutor, which we have placed in context, from his penalty-phase closing argument.\nWe are calling Mark Spotz to account. Mark Spotz deserves a fair trial. That he has received. This is his day in court. We are calling him to account for his offenses, for his crimes. He deserves that fair trial, and that\u2019s what he got.\nWhat we are asking you to do is to show him the same respect for women 'that he showed to Penny Gunnet. We are asking you to put him to death. Thank you.\nN.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 371-72 (emphasis added to portion quoted in Appellant\u2019s Brief at 43).\nAppellant asserts that, with the above comment, the prosecutor improperly invoked the gender of the victim and issued \u201ca blatant cry for vengeance calculated to appeal to the prejudices of the jury [and to] divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 43 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). We disagree, and consistent with our precedent, we conclude that the challenged remarks were within the bounds of oratorical license that is permissible when the prosecutor is arguing for the death penalty.\nAs we recently summarized in Paddy, 15 A.3d at 461, this Court has consistently held that a prosecutor does not exceed the permissible bounds of oratorical license when he or she asks the jury to show a defendant the same mercy and/or sympathy that the defendant showed to the victim. Here, the prosecutor was expressing much the same sentiment when he asked the jury to show Appellant the same \u201crespect\u201d that he showed for Ms. Gunnet. We see no logical reason to distinguish the prosecutor\u2019s statement here from our allowed precedents, as summarized in Paddy, supra. Furthermore, although the prosecutor\u2019s statement is somewhat oddly constructed and not entirely comprehensible, we do not conclude that his addition of the words \u201cfor women\u201d transformed the argument for imposition of the death penalty into one based on gender. There is no merit to Appellant\u2019s assertion of prosecutorial misconduct, and, accordingly, no arguable merit to his derivative claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\nFollowing thorough review of all of Appellant\u2019s sub-issues in Issue 6, we conclude that he is entitled to no relief.\nIssue 7: Investigation, Development, and Presentation of Mitigating Evidence\nIn Issue 7, Appellant claims that counsel were ineffective for failing to investigate, develop, and present all the available evidence of mitigation. In Appellant\u2019s view, \u201ccounsel only did the most superficial of investigations and failed to uncover voluminous records,\u201d resulting in the presentation of \u201conly a shell of the mitigation that could have been presented.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 45, 56. More specifically, Appellant asserts that counsel failed to present dispositive evidence of the childhood abuse and violence suffered by Appellant, the sadistic and perverted home environment in which he grew up, his true psychiatric diagnoses, the severity of and reasons behind his substance abuse, and his family history of mental illness. Id.\nFollowing an extensive hearing, the PCRA court rejected this claim, first pointing out that, during the penalty phase of Appellant\u2019s trial, testimony in mitigation was received from numerous witnesses, including Jean Redden, Appellant\u2019s grandmother; Jean Newpher, his mother; Molly Muir, his family\u2019s caseworker and CYS administrator; and Stephen Ragusea, Ph.D., a forensic psychologist who was retained by defense counsel to evaluate Appellant. See PCRA Court Opinion at 15-16. Based on the penalty-phase testimony, the jury found two mitigating circumstances, to wit, 9711(e)(2), under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance; and 9711(e)(8), character of the defendant and circumstances of his offense, including a bad childhood. See Spotz II, 756 A.2d at 1147 n. 9. The PCRA court compared the penalty-phase testimony of Ms. Redden, Ms. Muir, and Dr. Ragusea to their respective PCRA hearing testimony, and determined that the PCRA testimony was cumulative of the evidence presented at trial. See PCRA Court Opinion at 16-20. In addition, the PCRA court expressly found portions of Ms. Redden\u2019s PCRA hearing testimony \u201cincredible and not convincing.\u201d Id. at 16. The PCRA court also recognized that Appellant had raised similar claims in his collateral appeals of his first-degree murder convictions in Cumberland and Schuylkill Counties. Id. at 17-19 (citing Spotz V, 896 A.2d at 1225-35; Commonwealth v. Spotz, No. 794 Criminal 1995, Opinion, dated 6/28/08, at 42-46 (Cumberland County Court of Common Pleas) (Bayley, J.)). The PCRA court determined that the decisions of this Court in Spotz V and of the Cumberland County Court of Common Pleas were applicable to the claims raised by Appellant here. Id. In conclusion, the PCRA court determined that the outcome of the penalty phase would not have been different had the cumulative evidence been presented, and, accordingly, held that there was no merit to Appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to investigate, develop, and present additional evidence of mitigation. Id. at 20.\nBefore reviewing Appellant\u2019s multiple claims in this issue, we emphasize that Appellant raised similar, if not identical, claims before this Court in his unsuccessful Cumberland County and Schuylkill County PCRA appeals. See Spotz VI, supra at 305-20; Spotz V, supra at 1225-37. As we explained in those prior cases, Appellant\u2019s defense counsel in his three capital murder trials in three counties organized and carried out a joint investigative effort, with shared responsibility for investigation of his background for mitigation purposes. Spotz VI, supra at 306; Spotz V, supra at 1230-33. Appellant\u2019s institutional records were collected as part of this tricounty cooperative defense effort. Spotz V, supra at 1233. At the PCRA hearing in the instant case, Mr. Blocher, Appellant\u2019s trial counsel, confirmed the tri-county collaborative effort with regard to mitigation efforts, including the collection and sharing of institutional records and the sharing of the psychologist expert witness, Dr. Ragusea, as well as of an investigator.\nOur review of Appellant\u2019s claims is guided by well-established legal principles regarding counsel\u2019s duty to investigate evidence of mitigating circumstances.\nIt is well established that capital defense counsel has a duty to undertake reasonable investigations or to make reasonable decisions that render particular investigations unnecessary. In the context of the penalty phase, trial counsel has an obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\u2019s background, particularly with respect to the preparation and presentation of mitigation evidence. This obligation includes the duty of penalty phase counsel to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor. The reasonableness of a particular investigation depends upon evidence known to counsel, as well as evidence that would cause a reasonable attorney to conduct a further investigation. At the same time, counsel\u2019s obligations do not require an investigation into every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no matter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing.\nThe reasonableness of counsel\u2019s investigation and preparation for the penalty phase, of course, often depends critically upon the information supplied by the defendant. Counsel cannot be found ineffective for failing to introduce information uniquely within the knowledge of the defendant and his family [that] is not provided to counsel____[Different light falls upon counsel\u2019s performance depending upon whether counsel asked and was not told, or alternatively, whether counsel did not ask and therefore was not told.\nSpotz VI, 18 A.3d at 305-06 (internal citations omitted).\nFinally, we have consistently held that counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence that would have been merely cumulative of evidence presented during the penalty phase. Commonwealth v. Chmiel, 612 Pa. 333, 30 A.3d 1111, 1161 (2011); Commonwealth v. Miller, 605 Pa. 1, 987 A.2d 638, 667 (2009); Spotz V, supra at 1231, 1232. We proceed now to consider each of the six sub-issues that Appellant raises within Issue 7.\nIn his first sub-issue, Appellant asserts that, because of counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient investigation, the jury did not hear \u201cpowerful, corroborating evidence of ongoing physical and sexual abuse of [Appellant].\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 46. Appellant offers several lines of evidence in this regard that counsel allegedly did not investigate or develop, and hence did not present. First, Appellant proffers CYS and hospital records that, he claims, document the following: (1) medical treatments that Appellant received for injuries consistent with abuse and neglect; (2) assaultive conduct against Appellant and other family members by his brother Dustin; and (3) multiple reports of family abuse, neglect, and mental illness. Id. Appellant fails to identify or discuss any particular documerits in these voluminous records; he merely avers, without benefit of argument or explanation, that the records in total constitute \u201ccompelling\u201d and \u201chighly mitigating\u201d evidence that allegedly verified the abuse suffered by Appellant, explained the origins of his mental impairments, and would have undermined the weight the jury attached to Appellant\u2019s killing of his brother. Id. at 47. Our review of these records proffered by Appellant indicates, consistent with the conclusion of the PCRA court, that they are merely cumulative of the evidence proffered by defense counsel and admitted during the penalty phase of Appellant\u2019s trial. This Court reached the same conclusion with respect to the similar, if not identical, claims that Appellant raised in his PCRA appeals in Cumberland and Schuylkill Counties. See Spotz VI, supra at 306-12; Spotz V, supra at 1230-1233.\nAppellant also attempts to rely on the PCRA testimony of Ms. Redden, his grandmother. To place her PCRA testimony in proper perspective, it is important to recognize that Ms. Redden had provided extensive mitigation testimony during the penalty phase of Appellant\u2019s trial. Specifically, she described Appellant\u2019s unstable and dysfunctional childhood home environment, where one of his stepfathers taught him to smoke marijuana as a young child, drugs and alcohol were purchased instead of food, finances were dire, and Appellant and his brother Dustin were frequently hungry. N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 61-73. During her penalty-phase testimony, Ms. Redden also relayed how Appellant and his brother had come to live with her for approximately two years after CYS became involved with the family. Id. at 73-74. She testified that both children were \u201cemotionally upset\u201d and embarrassed, with Appellant exhibiting loss of bowel control that required medication, and Dustin unable to control urination. Id. at 75-76. In addition, she recalled that when he was very young, Appellant had \u201ccounseling and ... was put on some kind of emotional medication.\u201d Id. at 88. She also testified that both children told her that their stepfather hit them with what he called \u201cthe enforcer,\u201d a thick, wide, long piece of leather; Dustin showed her his naked buttocks, which were \u201cstreaked.\u201d Id. at 80-81. Appellant\u2019s biological father was also abusive toward him, and Dustin would wrestle with Appellant and hurt him. Id. at 82, 90. With regard to sexual abuse, Ms. Redden\u2019s penalty-phase testimony described an incident where Appellant, at five years old, told her that Dustin had started to \u201ctouch\u201d him. Id. at 81.\nMuch of Ms. Redden\u2019s PCRA testimony was duplicative of her penalty-phase testimony. The primary difference was that in her PCRA testimony Ms. Redden explicitly and graphically described several instances of sexual abuse suffered by Appellant in his home at the hands of his mother, stepfather, and brother. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/17/07, at 22, 24-27. When PCRA counsel asked Ms. Redden if she would have talked about these incidents of sexual abuse at Appellant\u2019s penalty hearing, she testified that she would have, but that \u201csexual abuse was never an issue\u201d at the penalty hearing and that \u201cthere was never any occasion [on which she] was asked to testify on anything but physical abuse.\u201d Id. at 46. Ms. Redden\u2019s assertion is belied by the transcript of the penalty-phase hearing, which reveals that defense counsel asked Ms. Redden if Appellant had told her \u201cof any sexual abuse that might have occurred in the home.\u201d N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 81. It was in response to this question that Ms. Redden testified concerning Dustin\u2019s \u201ctouching\u201d of Appellant, as summarized supra, but she did not mention the graphic episodes of sexual abuse that she described during the PCRA hearing. The PCRA court expressly found Ms. Redden\u2019s PCRA hearing testimony \u201cincredible and not convincing.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion at 16. We defer to the PCRA court\u2019s credibility determination, noting only that, in this case, the PCRA court\u2019s credibility determination is very strongly supported by the certified record. We decline to conclude that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to present, at the penalty phase, the graphic examples of sexual abuse presented at the PCRA hearing, when counsel did in fact ask the witness during the penalty phase about incidents of sexual abuse in the home, but was not informed of any, and the PCRA court found the PCRA testimony incredible. See Spotz VI at 305-06 and citations therein.\nFinally, Appellant attempts to rely on the PCRA hearing testimony of Dr. Blumberg, who testified that Appellant had reported sexual abuse by his mother and stepfather, which was consistent with some of his behavior as well as the reports by his grandmother. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/18/07, at 334, 350-55. Appellant fails to consider the substantial evidence that defense counsel presented during the penalty phase concerning the abuse suffered by Appellant as a child. We have already summarized his grandmother\u2019s penalty-phase testimony, which was largely focused on the abuse suffered by Appellant and Dustin. See text supra. In addition, Appellant\u2019s mother, Jean Newpher, testified at the penalty-phase hearing as to the abuse perpetrated upon her sons in her home. For example, she testified that Darrall Newpher, their stepfather, had burned Dustin\u2019s hand with a book of matches, had required Appellant to play \u201cbartender,\u201d and had showed the boys how to smoke marijuana when they were respectively eight and nine years of age. N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 110-13, 118-19. Mr. Newpher confirmed that he had smoked marijuana with Appellant as a child in order to \u201clet him know ... what it was like to do drugs,\u201d but \u201cit didn\u2019t quite work out.\u201d Id., 4/24/96, at 254. Ms. Newpher further testified that the children observed drug and alcohol parties in her home. Id., 4/23/96, at 143-44, 150. In addition, according to Ms. Newpher, a woman who lived with the family for some time \u201cwas constantly flashing different body parts\u201d at Appellant when he was 13 years old. Id. at 121-22. Ms. Newpher also testified as to Dustin\u2019s violent episodes, fits of rage, and brutal attacks on Appellant with a variety of different weapons. Id. at 128-29,134-36,140-41, 145.\nSeveral extended family members testified during the penalty phase as to the abusive, unsuitable conditions in Appellant\u2019s childhood home, including Lorraine Page, Appellant\u2019s great-aunt, who eventually adopted Appellant\u2019s younger half-sister; and Nancy Jo Dale, Appellant\u2019s second cousin and baby-sitter, who brought food to Appellant and Dustin in their home, and testified that they had appeared at her house late one night, wanting to come in because their stepfather had punished them by putting their hands on the furnace. Id. at 96, 98-100, 179-82. Two of Appellant\u2019s cousins by marriage, Anna Miller and Tonya Oakes, testified that Dustin had sexually molested them and their sisters, but Appellant had helped them. Id., at 163-64; id., 4/24/96, at 225-26.\nMolly Muir, an administrator for CYS and a caseworker for Appellant\u2019s family, testified as to the continuing instability, dysfunction, aggressive physical discipline, and lack of life\u2019s necessities in Appellant\u2019s childhood home. CYS contact with the family began in 1977, when Appellant\u2019s mother indicated that she was unable and unwilling to care for her sons and requested placement. N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 186-87. CYS\u2019s records indicated that Ms. Newpher did not feel any love toward her sons, and that severe family dysfunction was ongoing. Id. at 187,194,197. Although Appellant and Dustin were placed with Ms. Redden, the case file was closed in 1979, after Ms. Newpher moved out of state with her sons. Id. at 188,193. In 1982, CYS again became involved with the family following an emergency room report that Appellant had been injured by his stepfather. Id. at 194. Ms. Muir testified that CYS\u2019s records continued to indicate that Appellant and Dustin \u201cwere essentially incorrigible, that [Ms. Newpher] wasn\u2019t able to manage their behavior, was unable to care for them, didn\u2019t want to care for them.\u201d Id. In January 1985, both boys ran away because they were being beaten. Id. at 198. At that point, there was a private agreement that custody of Appellant would be transferred to other relatives, to wit, Mr. and Ms. Dale; however, the Dales were unable to manage Appellant\u2019s behavior. Id. at 199. CYS again became involved with Appellant after an \u201cabandonment,\u201d i.e., after Ms. Newpher refused to retrieve him from the Dale\u2019s home. Id. at 199-200. Appellant then proceeded through a series of foster homes. Id. at 200-02. In August 1985, Appellant\u2019s guardian ad litem petitioned the court to have him returned home, which action was taken, even though the requirements of CYS\u2019s service plan had not been accomplished and despite CYS\u2019s objection. Id. at 203-05, 213-14.\nDr. Ragusea, the forensic psychologist who evaluated Appellant in the fall of 1995, testified during the penalty phase that Appellant\u2019s family was \u201cfull of violence [and the] children were frequently abused.\u201d N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 293. In his PCRA testimony, Dr. Ragusea testified in general terms that the abuse suffered by Appellant was \u201cmore severe\u201d than he had thought at the time of trial. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/11/08, at 559.\nHaving reviewed all of the evidence presented at the penalty phase and the PCRA hearing, we conclude that the certified record supports the PCRA court\u2019s conclusion that the additional evidence and testimony presented at the PCRA hearing are merely cumulative of the evidence of abuse presented at the penalty-phase hearing. Accordingly, there is no merit to Appellant\u2019s assertion that counsel was ineffective for failing to preserve, develop, and present additional mitigation evidence of physical and sexual abuse. See Miller, 987 A.2d at 667 (reiterating that counsel is not ineffective for failing to present mitigating evidence that is merely cumulative); Spotz V, supra at 1231,1232.\nIn his second sub-issue of Issue 7, Appellant asserts that counsel did not investigate, develop, and present evidence of Dustin\u2019s mental illness and violent behavior toward Appellant. Appellant argues that such evidence would have diminished the impact of Appellant\u2019s voluntary manslaughter conviction as an aggravating circumstance. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 48.\nAppellant ignores the considerable evidence that was admitted at trial concerning Dustin\u2019s mental health problems and violent behavior, particularly toward Appellant. Ms. Redden testified that Appellant was \u201cscared to death of bigger kids because of his brother\u201d Dustin, who was larger than Appellant and who wrestled with Appellant and hurt him. N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 82. Ms. Newpher, the mother of both Appellant and Dustin, testified extensively about Dustin\u2019s violent outbursts, relating in detail several incidents involving Appellant. In one incident in 1989, Dustin walked into their house; flew into a rage, accusing Appellant of some minor slight; grabbed and twisted his mother\u2019s arm and threatened to break it; and then stabbed Appellant in the hand with a knife when he tried to intervene. Id. at 128-29. Appellant required stitches for the wound. Id. at 129. Describing another incident, she testified as follows:\nNext thing you know Dustin gets mad because Dustin would go into fits of rages for no reason in particular. He would just flip out. He would start kicking, punching, biting, pulling his hair \u2014 pulling [Appellant\u2019s] hair, scratching him, pick him up upside down and let his feet fly out from underneath him with [Appellant\u2019s] head between his knees and drop [Appellant] on his head on the floor and stovepipe his neck. It\u2019s called a pile driver. The television says don\u2019t practice this at home it could be dangerous.\nId. at 135.\nMs. Newpher testified that Dustin \u201cbrutalized\u201d Appellant, explaining that Dustin physically attacked him, using a variety of weapons, including a knife, a baseball bat, or rocks, sometimes doing so under the guise of helping him. Id. at 133-34, 141. Ms. Newpher made clear that such behavior was not unusual for Dustin, who consistently was the aggressor. Id. at 129, 135-36; see also id. at 145 (on cross-examination, testifying that Dustin \u201cbeat up on [Appellant] on a regular basis[,] not occasionally\u201d). When asked if Dustin had any religious beliefs, her answer was \u201cSatanic.\u201d Id. at 137. She described Dustin\u2019s personality as \u201cschizophrenic,\u201d explaining as follows:\nAn example is he [Dustin] could hug me, mom, I love you so much, push me away, you G-D bitch, and slap me across the face. He had instant mood swings. It was like different personality [sic]. One second he could be so sweet and loving and nice[,] and the next second he was making statements, I\u2019ll tear your heart out and eat it in front of you.\nId.\nDustin\u2019s violence toward other members of the extended family was established by two of Appellant\u2019s cousins by marriage, who testified that Dustin had sexually molested them and their sisters. Id. at 163-64; Id., 4/24/96, at 225-26.\nIt was also clear from penalty-phase testimony that numerous attempts had been made, via the intervention of CYS and other institutions, to help Dustin and his family with his mental health issues. Ms. Newpher testified that Dustin had been in a home for delinquent boys. Id., 4/23/96, at 123. Ms. Muir testified that, through her duties as a caseworker for CYS, she had \u201cvery frequent\u201d contact with Dustin, who \u201cwas verbally threatening [and] angry most of the time.\u201d Id. at 196, 215. In addition, Ms. Newpher described the following incident involving a different, unidentified caseworker from youth services.\nYouth services had a caseworker with us because Dustin was a chronic runaway. The young lady came over, very very petite, right out of college. I do not recall her name. Something was said and Dustin looks at the girl and says, I\u2019ll show you how crazy I can be. And he went out and got a butcher knife and started running around the house with it and chased [Appellant] upstairs with the knife. [Appellant] locked himself in the bathroom. Came back downstairs and the girl is screaming, take it away, take it away, get it away from him. My husband had to pin Dustin on the floor on his stomach with a knee in the middle of his back to wrestle the knife out of his hand before somebody got hurt, and she just \u2014 this young lady threw up her hands and said this is not a textbook case, I can\u2019t handle it, and she never came back.\nId. at 140-41.\nIn light of all of this testimony, Appellant\u2019s assertion that counsel was ineffective for failing to present even more evidence of Dustin\u2019s violent behavior and mental health problems has no arguable merit. The additional evidence relied upon by Appellant in this sub-issue is merely cumulative of the testimony presented during the penalty phase, and counsel is not ineffective for failing to present cumulative evidence.\nIn Appellant\u2019s third sub-issue of Issue 7, he asserts that CYS responded \u201cwith varying degrees of inadequacy\u201d to numerous allegations of abuse and neglect in the Newpher household. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 49. In Appellant\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he systemic failure of [CYS] to address [his] needs ... and the resulting impact on his psychological, psychiatric and emotional development, ... constitute[ ] compelling mitigation evidence.\u201d Id. As support for this assertion, Appellant relies on the opinion of Richard Gelles, Ph.D., the Dean of the School of Social Policy and Practice at the University of Pennsylvania, who was retained by PCRA counsel and prepared a report. With regard to Dr. Gelles\u2019s opinion, Appellant avers as follows: \u201c[Dr. Gelles] concluded the state welfare agencies, including CYS, failed to investigate, rectify, or redress the needs of Appellant throughout critical development periods of his life[,] ... ignored [ ] signs [of severe abuse and neglect in the home,] and continued to place [Appellant] in a dangerous environment.\u201d Id. at 50.\nAppellant fails to mention that the Commonwealth objected to Dr. Gelles\u2019s testifying, and the PCRA court sustained the objection, refusing to permit Dr. Gelles to testify. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/10/08, at 362-63. Appellant does not challenge this evidentiary ruling of the PCRA court, but merely asserts that Dr. Gelles\u2019s opinion establishes the claims in this sub-issue. We will not review a claim based on testimony that was not admitted by, and thus was not before, the PCRA court. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (\u201cIssues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d).\nIn Appellant\u2019s fourth sub-issue of Issue 7, he asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence during the penalty phase regarding Appellant\u2019s use of drugs and alcohol, both chronically and at the time of the murders. Specifically, Appellant lists several witnesses \u201cavailable to counsel [but] not presented,\u201d all of whom could have testified as to Appellant\u2019s heavy drug use and/or alcohol use. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 50. The witnesses listed by Appellant are the same as those he cited in Issue 4, where he claimed that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and develop the guilt-phase defense of diminished capacity due to voluntary intoxication. See Issue 4, supra, for a detailed summary of the PCRA testimony of these witnesses. As we discussed in Issue 4, none of these witnesses provided any insight as to Appellant\u2019s state of intoxication at the time of Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder. Nonetheless, Appellant argues that their testimony regarding his drug and alcohol use would have supported three mitigating circumstances, to wit, subsections 9711(e)(2), under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance; 9711(e)(3), substantial impairment of the capacity to conform conduct to the requirements of the law; and 9711(e)(8), character and record of the defendant and circumstances of the offense (\u201ccatch-all\u201d mitigator). Appellant\u2019s assertion is without merit, based on our well-established precedent.\nIn Commonwealth v. Lester, 554 Pa. 644, 722 A.2d 997, 1006 (1998), the appellant argued, similarly to Appellant here, that his drug use could be a mitigating factor. In rejecting this argument, we acknowledged that there had been testimony from the appellant\u2019s family members concerning his drug problem; however, we emphasized that there had been no evidence that the appellant was using drugs at the time of the murder. Accordingly, we held that the appellant\u2019s claim that his drug use constituted a mitigating factor lacked any foundation. Id. Consistent with Lester, we have also held that a diagnosis of substance abuse combined with a finding of alcohol consumption on the day of the murder do not alone support mitigating factor 9711(e)(2), because they do not establish that the defendant was under an extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the murder. Commonwealth v. Gibson, 610 Pa. 332, 19 A.3d 512, 527 (2011) (citing Commonwealth v. Saranchak, 581 Pa. 490, 866 A.2d 292, 305 (2005)); see also Commonwealth v. Rice, 568 Pa. 182, 795 A.2d 340, 354-55 (2002) (holding that the trial court had properly declined to instruct the jury regarding mitigating circumstance 9711(e)(2), because the appellant had failed to present any evidence that he had been suffering from an extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of his offense, even though evidence of his abuse of drugs and alcohol at other times had been admitted). With regard to proving that voluntary intoxication was a mitigating factor under subsection 9711(e)(3), we have applied a stringent standard: the defendant must show that, at the time of the murder, he \u201cwas overwhelmed or overpowered by alcohol to the point of losing his faculties so as to be incapable of forming a specific intent to kill.\u201d Commonwealth v. Flor, 606 Pa. 384, 998 A.2d 606, 627 n. 7 (2010) (citation omitted); Gibson, supra at 529 (same).\nHere, none of the evidence presented at the PCRA hearing supported a finding that Appellant was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of Ms. Gunnet\u2019s murder, much less that he was intoxicated to the point of being under extreme mental or emotional disturbance, or to the point of losing his faculties and sensibilities. Thus, the evidence was not supportive of any mitigating circumstances. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to develop and present irrelevant evidence.\nIn Appellant\u2019s fifth sub-issue of Issue 7, he asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to properly investigate, develop, and present mental health mitigating evidence. Appellant focuses on counsel\u2019s failure to obtain, and to forward to Dr. Ragusea, certain documents concerning Appellant and his family, including records from various mental health centers, a school, courts of common pleas, and prisons. Appellant argues that because Dr. Ragusea did not have these records, he was unable at the time of trial \u201cto render critical diagnoses and opinions.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 51. Appellant raised the same claim in his collateral appeals of his first-degree murder convictions in Cumberland and Schuylkill Counties. Spotz VI, supra at 313-15; Spotz V, supra at 1233-35. In these prior PCRA appeals, we concluded that there was no merit to this claim, and we come to the same conclusion here, as explained below.\nWe first must emphasize that Dr. Ragusea testified during the penalty-phase proceedings in considerable detail concerning his assessment of Appellant\u2019s mental health. Dr. Ragusea concluded that Appellant is \u201can individual who is severely disturbed,\u201d although Dr. Ragusea acknowledged that Appellant might have been exaggerating his symptoms somewhat during the psychological testing. N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 279. Dr. Ragusea explained that Appellant had high scores in tests \u201cdesigned to measure psychotic tendencies; bizarre experiences, unusual ways of thinking, unusual ways of relating to other human beings that are typical of very seriously disturbed individuals.\u201d Id. at 278. Furthermore, Dr. Ragusea explained that his conclusions were supported by Appellant\u2019s background history, specifically by information suggesting that even when Appellant was \u201ca very small child he was extremely paranoid, grossly over suspicious, had a hard time relating with other people.\u201d Id. at 281. One example that Dr. Ragusea gave was an observation by an individual who had cared for Appellant as a child \u201cduring one of those episodes when his mother would throw him out of the house.\u201d Id. The caregiver said that it was common for Appellant to hide in the closet with the light on in the middle of the night, looking frightened. Id. Dr. Ragusea also cited \u201cfrequent references[, which were confirmed by Appellant,] throughout the record during [Appellant\u2019s] childhood and adolescence of over suspiciousness, of paranoia, of reports of hallucinatory experiences, hearing voices, seeing things that aren\u2019t there.\u201d Id. at 281-82. Dr. Ragusea described Appellant as \u201can individual who tends to experience difficulties with reality testing [and] doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s real some of the time.\u201d Id. at 292. Dr. Ragusea also indicated that drug usage caused further deterioration of Appellant\u2019s mental state: \u201cSo I would say that given [Appellant\u2019s] overall profile[,] traumatic experiences, drug-induced experiences would only keep it more difficult for him to stay glued together.\u201d Id. at 284. Thus, there is no question that, during the penalty-phase of trial, Dr. Ragusea characterized Appellant, using lay terms for a lay jury, as an individual with severe mental and emotional disturbances that strongly affected his ability to function in daily life.\nFinally, using more technical language, Dr. Ragusea further testified during the penalty phase that he had diagnosed Appellant with the following mental health disorders: (1) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; (2) polysubstance abuse; (3) sexual abuse, physical abuse, and neglect; (4) post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress reaction related to the killing of his brother; and (5) mixed personality disorder \u201cincluding features of borderline personality, antisocial personality, and schizotypal features.\u201d Id., at 306-11.\nAt the PCRA hearing, after reviewing the additional records sent to him by PCRA counsel, Dr. Ragusea changed his diagnosis in the following ways: (1) he modified his prior diagnosis of mixed personality disorder, including features of borderline personality, antisocial personality, and schizotypal features, to a diagnosis of borderline personality and schizoaffective disorder; and (2) he changed his diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress reaction to a diagnosis of pre-existing chronic severe post-traumatic stress disorder that was related to the many traumas Appellant had suffered as a child. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/11/08, at 552, 566. Dr. Ragusea reported a similar if not identical modification of diagnoses, prompted by his review of additional records, in his testimony during Appellant\u2019s PCRA proceedings in Cumberland and Schuylkill Counties. Spotz VI, supra at 313-15; Spotz V, supra at 1233-35. Our holding in Spotz VI applies equally well here:\nWhile we do not minimize the potential significance of the revised diagnoses to trained psychologists or psychiatrists involved in mental health treatment, we can locate nothing in the record to suggest that the revisions would have been determinative in the deliberations of the jury. We agree with the PCRA court that Dr. Ragusea\u2019s revised diagnoses on collateral appeal constitute no prejudice to Appellant because he has not established that the revisions would have caused the jury to weigh differently the mitigating versus aggravating circumstances.\nSpotz VI, supra at 315.\nAppellant\u2019s reliance on one part of Dr. Ragusea\u2019s penalty-phase testimony, to wit, his technical diagnoses, ig\u00f1ores the psychologist\u2019s extensive and detailed description of Appellant\u2019s mental disabilities, which was delivered clearly and in lay terms and was not appreciably altered in Dr. Ragusea\u2019s PCRA testimony. Given all the information that the jurors heard concerning Appellant\u2019s mental disturbances, we cannot conclude that, if only the jurors had heard the revised technical diagnoses, there is a reasonable probability that they would have reached a different verdict. Thus, as we held in Spotz VI, we hold here that there is no merit to Appellant\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain the additional mental health, criminal, and prison records of Appellant and his family.\nIn Appellant\u2019s sixth and final sub-issue of Issue 7, he asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate, develop, and present a psychological evaluation of Appellant prepared by the Department of Corrections\u2019s chief psychologist, Franklin P. Ryan, Ph.D. Appellant maintains that this evaluation supports a finding that Appellant will adjust well to prison life and is therefore mitigating evidence that should have been presented during the penalty phase. Appellant raised precisely the same claim with respect to precisely the same document in Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 316-19, and Spotz V, 896 A.2d at 1235-37. We held that the claim was meritless in those two prior cases, and for all the reasons described therein, we hold that the claim is meritless here.\nIssue 8: Aggravating Factor (d)(6)\nAppellant claims that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that the subsection 9711(d)(6) aggravating circumstance (defendant committed the killing while in the perpetration of a felony) does not apply to a defendant who is convicted of first-degree murder as an accomplice or co-conspirator. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 57. During the guilt phase of the trial, the court gave instructions to the jury concerning accomplice liability and co-conspirator liability, reflecting Appellant\u2019s defense that Ms. Noland actually shot the victim. N.T. Trial, 4/22/96, at 2052-56. However, the trial court did not instruct the jury that aggravating circumstance 9711(d)(6) is not applicable to a defendant who is convicted under accomplice or co-conspirator liability. Appellant further asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to this omission in the trial court\u2019s instructions.\nAppellant raised precisely the same claim in Spotz V, 896 A.2d at 1237-39. In Spotz V, we determined that Appellant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance had arguable merit, based on this Court\u2019s holding in Commonwealth v. Lassiter, 554 Pa. 586, 722 A.2d 657, 662 (1998) (plurality opinion). However, we ultimately concluded that Appellant was not entitled to relief because Lassiter was decided years after Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentencing. Spotz V, supra at 1238. Because effectiveness of counsel must be evaluated under the standards in effect at the time of performance, and because counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to predict developments or changes in the law, we declined to hold counsel ineffective in Spotz V for failing to request a jury instruction under Lassiter. The same holding applies here. See Spotz V, 896 A.2d at 1237-39.\nIssue 9: Ineffectiveness of Counsel during Penalty Phase\nIn Issue 9, Appellant includes five sub-issues, related only in that the matters complained of all occurred during the penalty phase of trial and involve allegations of counsel ineffectiveness. Specifically, the sub-issues are that counsel was ineffective for the following: (a) not objecting to the introduction of Appellant\u2019s burglary convictions to support aggravating factor 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9); (b) not objecting to or raising the trial court\u2019s allegedly unconstitutional restriction on the admission of mitigating evidence from Appellant\u2019s grandmother and mother, including the former\u2019s plea for mercy; (c) not objecting to the use of Appellant\u2019s \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d convictions in Clearfield and Schuylkill Counties as aggravating circumstances; (d) not objecting to the trial court\u2019s explanation to the jury of aggravating and mitigating circumstances; (e) not objecting to the use of Appellant\u2019s Clearfield and Schuylkill County convictions to support several different aggravating circumstances. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 58-64. We address each sub-issue in turn.\nIn sub-issue (a), Appellant asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the admission of Appellant\u2019s three burglary convictions to support aggravating factor 9711(d)(9). Appellant raised this matter in Issue 6(e) as a claim of prosecutorial misconduct. We thoroughly addressed the matter in Issue 6, supra, concluding that the underlying claim is meritless. There is no need to repeat that analysis here. We add only that, because the underlying claim is meritless, the derivative claim of ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to object has no arguable merit.\nIn sub-issue (b), Appellant asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise, on direct appeal, claims of trial court error with regard to the limitation of the mitigation testimony of Ms. Redden and Ms. Newpher, Appellant\u2019s grandmother and mother, respectively. Admission of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we review the trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. See e.g., Commonwealth v. Flor, 606 Pa. 384, 998 A.2d 606, 623 (2010). A conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion \u201crequires a result of manifest unreasonableness, or partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will, or such lack of support so as to be clearly erroneous.\u201d Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 611 Pa. 481, 28 A.3d 868, 873-74 (2011) (citation omitted).\nAppellant challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to admit, as hearsay, the following: Ms. Redden\u2019s testimony as to what a school principal had told her regarding CYS\u2019s action in taking custody of Appellant and Dustin when they were minors; and Ms. Newpher\u2019s testimony that she was told by physicians at Harrisburg Hospital that Appellant\u2019s biological father had been mainlining heroin and morphine. N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 74 and 107-08, respectively; see Appellant\u2019s Brief at 60. Appellant\u2019s entire argument with respect to this sub-issue consists of the following single sentence and three citations: \u201cDue process requires the admission of relevant mitigating evidence even if it violates a state law rule against the admission of hearsay. Sears v. Upton [\u2014 U.S. -], 130 S.Ct. 3259, 3263 & n. 6 [177 L.Ed.2d 1025] (2010); Green v. Georgia, 442 U.S. 95, 97 [99 S.Ct. 2150, 60 L.Ed.2d 738] (1979); see also Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 302 [93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297] (1973).\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 60. None of the alleged authority for Appellant\u2019s formulation of prevailing law is accompanied by so much as an explanatory parenthetical. Contrary to Appellant\u2019s undeveloped averment, none of the cited cases, or any other precedent of which we are aware, can be interpreted in such a broad, all-encompassing manner.\nThis Court has recently discussed Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973), one of the cases upon which Appellant purports to rely, in the context of Appellant\u2019s collateral challenge to a hearsay ruling during his first-degree murder trial in Cumberland County. See Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 274-75. As we stated in Spotz VI, the Chambers holding did not \u201csignal any diminution in the respect traditionally accorded to the States in the establishment and implementation of their own criminal trial rules and procedures.\u201d Id. at 275 (quoting Chambers, supra at 302-03, 93 S.Ct. 1038). \u201cChambers cannot generally be relied upon to support common, straightforward challenges to hearsay rulings that have correctly applied state criminal procedure.\u201d Id.\nIn Green v. Georgia, 442 U.S. 95, 99 S.Ct. 2150, 60 L.Ed.2d 738 (1979) (per curiam), the Supreme Court, citing Chambers, held that the petitioner was denied a fair trial on the issue of punishment, and vacated his death sentence because the trial court had excluded, as hearsay, testimony regarding his co-conspirator\u2019s confession that he alone had committed the murder with which both co-conspirators were charged. In concluding that \u201cthe hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically to defeat the ends of justice,\u201d the High Court stressed the unique circumstances of the case; the high relevance of the testimony to a critical issue; and the substantial reasons to assume the reliability of the confession, which included ample corroborative evidence, used by the state to obtain a conviction against the petitioner\u2019s co-conspirator in a separate trial, and the fact that the confession was a statement against penal interest made spontaneously to a close friend. Green, supra at 97, 99 S.Ct. 2150 (quoting Chambers, supra at 302, 93 S.Ct. 1038).\nFinally, Appellant attempts to rely on Sears v. Upton, \u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 3259, 3263 & n. 6, 177 L.Ed.2d 1025 (2010) {per curiam), where the High Court cited Green and Chambers as recognizing that \u201creliable hearsay evidence that is relevant to a capital defendant\u2019s mitigation defense should not be excluded by rote application of a state hearsay rule.\u201d The Sears Court also noted that it took no position as to whether the evidence at issue in that case \u201cwould satisfy the considerations [ ] set forth in Green, or would be otherwise admissible under [state] law.\u201d Id.\nHere, Appellant fails to acknowledge \u2014 much less apply to the circumstances of his case \u2014 the full import and the nuances of the High Court\u2019s holdings in Chambers, Green, and Sears. More specifically, Appellant makes no argument that the testimony at issue would satisfy the considerations set forth by the High Court in Green or would be admissible under the law of this Commonwealth. More specifically, Appellant relies on no unique circumstances in his case, declines to explain why the testimony was highly relevant to a specific critical issue, provides absolutely no basis upon which to conclude that the statements at issue were reliable, and offers no potentially applicable hearsay exception. See Green, supra. Our review makes clear that the trial court did not mechanistically apply the hearsay rule to defeat the ends of justice, but rather acted well within its discretion in sustaining the Commonwealth\u2019s hearsay objections. Thus, because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the testimony at issue was inadmissible hearsay, there is no arguable merit to Appellant\u2019s derivative claims of ineffectiveness.\nAlso in sub-issue (b), Appellant asserts that the trial court erred in instructing the jury to disregard Ms. Redden\u2019s statement asking that Appellant\u2019s life be spared. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 60; N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 93. Finally, Appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, asserting that \u201cinstead of giving a proper mercy charge, [the trial court] gave essentially an anti-mercy one.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 60; N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 406-07. Appellant\u2019s claims of trial court error are waived pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9543(a)(3) and 9544(b), but his derivative claims of ineffectiveness for failing to raise the asserted errors are cognizable.\nAs this Court has previously explained, Pennsylvania\u2019s capital sentencing statute does not permit a jury to consider mercy as a stand-alone factor, unmoored from any evidence admitted in support of a specific statutory mitigator. Commonwealth v. Powell, 598 Pa. 224, 956 A.2d 406, 426-27 (2008); see also Commonwealth v. Zook, 532 Pa. 79, 615 A.2d 1, 13 (1992) (relying on our capital sentencing statute to conclude that a jury does not have unbridled discretion to grant mercy or leniency); Commonwealth v. Henry, 524 Pa. 135, 569 A.2d 929, 941 (1990) (explaining that our capital sentencing statute precludes \u201cabsolute mercy verdicts,\u201d and requires that a jury\u2019s consideration of mercy or sympathy be based upon the evidence). Pursuant to our statute, a capital defendant is permitted to introduce a broad range of mitigating evidence, which the jury then weighs against the aggravating circumstances. During this weighing process, the jury may give consideration to mercy or sympathy, but the jury may not \u201cexercise its sense of mercy or sympathy in a vacuum.\u201d Powell, supra at 427. We have explained that this rule is essential to avoid arbitrariness in capital sentencing. Id.\nWe have previously held that the testimony of a victim\u2019s relative regarding her personal opposition to the death penalty was inadmissible under our capital sentencing statute because it did not constitute evidence relevant to any of the mitigating circumstances of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e). Commonwealth v. Bomar, 573 Pa. 426, 826 A.2d 831, 852 (2003). In addition, we have rejected outright the assertion that the court is required to give an instruction on mercy. Commonwealth v. Bardo, 551 Pa. 140, 709 A.2d 871, 876 (1998). However, a trial court may instruct the jury that it is permitted to be swayed by sympathy, but only when the sympathy relates to and is derived from the evidence. Henry, supra at 941.\nHere, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury to disregard Ms. Redden\u2019s plea that Appellant\u2019s life be spared. Ms. Redden made her unsolicited plea at the end of her testimony, not in response to any question, but after she was told by the court to step down from the witness stand. N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 93 (\u201cMay I ask that [Appellant\u2019s] life be spared[?]\u201d). Her plea to spare Appellant\u2019s life was not evidence and was not relevant to any mitigating circumstance; it did not concern the character or record of Appellant, nor the circumstances of his offense. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8). As such, Ms. Redden\u2019s plea for Appellant\u2019s life was not admissible evidence, and the trial court correctly determined that it should not be considered by the jury.\nFurthermore, Appellant\u2019s assertion that the trial court gave an \u201canti-mercy\u201d charge to the jury, and thus erred, is baseless. The trial court properly instructed the jury to decide the case before it not on the basis of feelings or emotions, but rather on the basis of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, common sense, and human judgment. N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 406-07. Appellant fails to explain his understanding of \u201ca proper mercy charge,\u201d which, he asserts, should have been given. We have reviewed the charge actually given by the trial court and conclude that it properly directed the jurors to render a decision based on the evidence and the weighing of mitigating and aggravating circumstances. There was no error.\nBecause there was no trial court error, Appellant\u2019s derivative claims of ineffective assistance have no arguable merit, and he is entitled to no relief on this sub-issue.\nIn sub-issue (c), Appellant asserts that his voluntary manslaughter and first-degree murder convictions in, respectively, Clearfield and Schuylkill Counties, were unconstitutionally obtained, as evidenced by, apparently, his pending challenges to these convictions. Therefore, Appellant argues, the use of these prior convictions to support aggravating circumstances was improper and erroneous, and counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge their introduction during the penalty phase.\nAppellant raised an analogous claim in Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 283-84 & n. 24, and in Spotz V, 896 A.2d at 1224-25. In these prior cases, we held that the claim had no merit, and we reach the same holding here, based on the same rationale.\nThis Court has expressly held that the term \u201cconviction\u201d means simply \u201cfound guilty\u201d when used in the context of the aggravating circumstances set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d). A collateral murder conviction is not divested of its character as an aggravating circumstance merely because it remains at the appeal stage. Only if the conviction is overturned on appeal could an error ensue.\nSpotz VI, 18 A.3d at 284 (internal citations omitted).\nThis court has upheld all of Appellant\u2019s murder convictions. His voluntary manslaughter conviction remains in appellate proceedings. Thus, Appellant\u2019s underlying assertions in sub-issue (c) are contrary to the prevailing law of this Commonwealth, and accordingly are meritless. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise a meritless claim.\nIn sub-issue (d), Appellant challenges that portion of the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury in which the court instructed that aggravating and mitigating circumstances \u201care things that make first[-]degree murder either more terrible or less terrible.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 62 (quoting N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 397). In addition, Appellant claims that counsel was ineffective for failing to object to this portion of the jury instruction.\nWe have consistently rejected challenges to the inclusion of the concept of \u201cterribleness\u201d in jury instructions regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances. See, e.g., Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 282-83, and citations therein. As we recognized in Spotz VI, at 282, at the time of Appellant\u2019s trial in 1996, the \u201cless terrible\u201d versus \u201cmore terrible\u201d comparison was part of a Pennsylvania suggested standard criminal jury instruction. Our review of the entire jury instruction reveals that the trial court properly and clearly explained the general concepts behind aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and also explained each individual circumstance relevant to Appellant\u2019s case. Based on the trial court\u2019s entire instruction and this Court\u2019s ample precedent, we conclude that Appellant\u2019s claim of trial court error is meritless, and thus his derivative claim of ineffectiveness has no arguable merit.\nIn sub-issue (e), Appellant asserts that the trial court improperly permitted the jury to consider his Schuylkill County conviction for first-degree murder as support for three different aggravating circumstances, specifically, 9711(d)(9), significant history of violent felony convictions; 9711(d)(10), convicted of another offense for which a sentence of death or life imprisonment was possible; 9711(d)(ll), convicted of another murder. Appellant argues, without benefit of supporting authority, that such \u201ctriple-weighing\u201d of the same offense, same facts, and same conduct violates the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 63-64.\nThis Court previously rejected a similar argument in Commonwealth v. Lesko, 553 Pa. 233, 719 A.2d 217, 224 (1998), where the appellant\u2019s prior murder convictions were used to support aggravating factors 9711(d)(9) and (d)(10).\n[Subs]ection (d)(10) allows the jury to consider as aggravating circumstances another Federal or State offense for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable ..., and (d)(9) allows the jury to consider as aggravating circumstances a significant history of felony convictions involving the use of violence. Nothing in the statute provides that a criminal conviction may be considered under only one sub-section. [The murders of which the appellant was convicted] fit under both (d)(9) and (d)(10), and were, therefore, properly considered by the jury as presenting aggravating circumstances under both (d)(9) and (d)(10).\nLesko, supra at 224 (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nBased on Lesko, we conclude that the trial court committed no error in allowing Appellant\u2019s prior first-degree murder conviction to be used as support for three aggravating circumstances. Accordingly, there is no arguable merit to Appellant\u2019s derivative claim of ineffective assistance.\nHaving reviewed each of Appellant\u2019s sub-issues in Issue 9, and holding that all are meritless, we conclude that Appellant is not entitled to relief on this issue.\nIssue 10: Life Without Parole Instruction\nAppellant asserts that the trial court erred by not instructing the jury that a defendant who receives a life sentence for first-degree murder is statutorily ineligible for parole, and that trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the trial court\u2019s omission of this instruction. Appellant argues that the lack of the instruction violated his Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 66. Appellant relies on Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 156, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994) (plurality), in which a plurality of the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cwhere the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness is at issue and state law prohibits the defendant\u2019s release on parole, due process requires that the sentencing jury be informed that the defendant is parole ineligible.\u201d It is well established that a Simmons instruction is triggered only when a defendant\u2019s future dangerousness has been placed at issue and the defense has requested an instruction as to parole ineligibility. See, e.g., Spotz VI, supra at 299; Spotz III, 759 A.2d at 1291 & n. 14. In Shafer v. South Carolina, 532 U.S. 36, 121 S.Ct. 1263, 149 L.Ed.2d 178 (2001), the High Court clarified Simmons\u2019s holding as follows: \u201c[W]here a capital defendant\u2019s future dangerousness is at issue, and the only sentencing alternative to death available to the jury is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the jury of his parole ineligibility, either by a jury instruction or in arguments by counsel.\u201d Shafer, supra at 39, 121 S.Ct. 1263 (internal quotations marks and citation omitted) (emphasis added).\nHere, during closing argument, defense counsel made the following argument:\n[Appellant\u2019s intelligence] is important because what we\u2019re asking you to do is to impose a life sentence, a sentence whereby [Appellant] would spend the rest of his life with no possibility of parole, incarcerated to sit and to think about all the things that he\u2019s done in his life. This would not be something that would be put aside. This would be something that he could think about every day for the rest of his natural life.\n* * #\nI would submit to you that [Appellant] can be accountable while serving a life sentence in prison for the rest of his life. N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 390, 392 (emphasis added).\nThus, defense counsel explicitly informed the jury that a life sentence for Appellant meant that he would be imprisoned for the rest of his life with no possibility of parole. Defense counsel\u2019s statement is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Simmons and Shafer. Because defense counsel informed the jury of Appellant\u2019s ineligibility for parole from a life sentence, there is no arguable merit to Appellant\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to request a court instruction to the same effect.\nIssue 11: Cumulative Effect of Alleged Errors\nIn its entirety, Appellant\u2019s final claim is the following:\nThe cumulative effect of the errors described require relief as they render Appellant\u2019s conviction and death sentence fundamentally unfair. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437-38 [115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490] (1995); Commonwealth v. Sattazahn [597 Pa. 648], 952 A.2d 640, 670-71 (Pa.2008). Although Appellant is entitled to relief on each of those claims individually, it is unquestionable that the cumulative prejudice from the combination of court error, improper actions by the prosecution, and deficient performance by counsel at both the trial and appellate stages entitle[s] Appellant to relief.\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 69. The PCRA court denied this claim, finding that Appellant\u2019s argument lacked merit. PCRA Court Opinion at 25-26.\nAppellant raised a similar claim in Spotz VI, and in that case, we explained the relevant legal principles as follows:\nWe have often held that no number of failed [ ] claims may collectively warrant relief if they fail to do so individually. However, we have clarified that this principle applies to claims that fail because of lack of merit or arguable merit. When the failure of individual claims is grounded in lack of prejudice, then the cumulative prejudice from those individual claims may properly be assessed.\nSpotz VI, supra at 321 (internal question marks and citations omitted).\nHowever, while cumulative prejudice may properly be assessed with respect to individual claims that have failed due to lack of prejudice, \u201cnothing in our precedent relieves an appellant who claims cumulative prejudice from setting forth a specific, reasoned, and legally and factually supported argument for the claim. A bald averment of cumulative prejudice does not constitute a claim.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hutchinson, 611 Pa. 280, 25 A.3d 277, 319 (2011). Appellant has set forth no renewable claim, and he is entitled to no relief.\nIn sum, after careful review of all of Appellant\u2019s issues, we conclude that none is meritorious and he is entitled to no relief. In addition, we deny Appellant\u2019s Application Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 2501, for Leave to File Post-Submission Communication in the Form of a Motion to Amend Claims and Submit Supplemental Briefing, or Remand to PCRA Court, for the reasons expressed in this opinion. See footnote 49. PCRA court order affirmed.\nJustice EAKIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case, Justice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the decision of this case, Chief Justice CASTILLE, Justices BAER, and TODD join the opinion and Justice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-46.\n. Appellant also filed a motion for a stay of execution, which was granted on June 21, 2001.\n. The PCRA court had deferred an evidentiary hearing on Appellant's PCRA petition pending this Court's disposition of Appellant\u2019s challenge to his voluntary manslaughter conviction in the killing of his brother. This manslaughter conviction had been introduced as an aggravating circumstance during the penalty phase of Appellant\u2019s York County trial. As mentioned in the text, supra, the Superior Court had overturned the manslaughter conviction and granted Appellant a new trial, but this Court reversed and reinstated the conviction. Commonwealth v. Spotz, 582 Pa. 207, 870 A.2d 822 (2005) (\u201cSpotz IV\").\n. Appellant\u2019s issues, reproduced verbatim from his brief, are the following:\n1. Was Appellant entitled to a new trial because his waiver of counsel at the guilt-phase of trial was not voluntary, knowing, and/or intelligent?\n2. Was Appellant denied due process and the right to confrontation when the Commonwealth failed to disclose exculpatory evidence that would have impeached the testimony of its key witness, Appellant's co-defendant, and failed to correct her false and misleading testimony?\n3. Was Appellant denied due process and the right to confrontation when the Commonwealth failed to disclose exculpatory evidence that would have impeached the testimony of Charles Carothers, stood silent when Carothers misrepresented there was no deal, and in bad faith destroyed its notes of its interview with Carothers in which the offer had been tendered?\n4. Were counsel ineffective for failing to investigate and develop the guilt-phase defenses of voluntary intoxication and diminished capacity?\n5. Was Appellant denied his right to a fair trial as a result of court error, prosecutorial misconduct, and ineffective assistance of counsel?\n6. Was Appellant entitled to a new sentencing hearing as a result of prosecutorial misconduct in the sentencing phase of trial?\n7. Were counsel ineffective for failing to investigate, develop, and present available mitigating evidence and rebut aggravating circumstances?\n8. Was Appellant entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the sentencing jury improperly found the aggravating circumstance that the defendant committed the killing during the perpetration of a felony?\n9. Was Appellant denied a fair penalty hearing as a result of court error, conflict of interest, and ineffective assistance of counsel? 10. Was Appellant entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the court did not instruct the sentencing jury that a capital defendant who is sentenced to life in prison in ineligible for parole?\n11. Was Appellant entitled to relief from his conviction and sentence because of the cumulative effect of the errors committed at trial?\nAppellant's Brief at 1-2 (Statement of Questions Presented).\n. This Court decided Appellant\u2019s direct appeal on August 22, 2000, at which time the prevailing law required that a petitioner raise claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness at the first opportunity upon obtaining new counsel. See Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687 (1977), overruled by Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726 (2002). The record indicates that Appellant acted pro se during the guilt phase of his trial, and was represented by assistant public defenders Bruce Blocher and Suzanne Smith during the penalty phase of trial as well as on direct appeal. This PCRA petition thus constitutes the first opportunity for Appellant to raise claims of ineffectiveness of penalty phase or direct appeal counsel.\n. Appellant did not raise this issue on direct appeal. However, in Commonwealth v. Brown, 582 Pa. 461, 872 A.2d 1139, 1155-56 (2005), a majority of this Court held that \"the failure to raise on direct appeal a claim that the appellant was incompetent at the time of trial does not constitute a waiver of that claim for purposes of the PCRA.\u201d See Commonwealth v. Spotz, 610 Pa. 17, 18 A.3d 244, 262 n. 10 (2011) (\"Spotz VI\") (discussing Brown ). Pursuant to Brown, as applied in Spotz VI, we shall review Appellant's claim.\n. However, as this Court has previously recognized and discussed, Dr. Blumberg did offer some insight as to Appellant's competency when he testified as an expert witness on Appellant's behalf at his Cumberland County PCRA hearing in January 2007, approximately eight months prior to Dr. Blumberg\u2019s PCRA testimony in the instant case. See Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 267. In his Cumberland County PCRA petition, Appellant contended, exactly as he has done here, that he was not competent to waive his right to counsel. Dr. Blumberg, as well as Dr. Fox, testified at both the Cumberland County and York County PCRA hearings, and they relied on the same interviews with Appellant in both proceedings.\nAt the Cumberland County PCRA hearing, Dr. Blumberg testified that he found no evidence to suggest that Appellant was impaired with respect to his ability to understand the questions or the surroundings in the courtroom at the time of trial. Id. at 267. Furthermore, Dr. Blumberg testified that Appellant\u2019s mental disorders \"wouldn\u2019t preclude his being able to represent himself and ask direct questions and do cross-examination.\u201d Id. (quoting N.T. PCRA Hearing in Cumberland County, 1/18/07, at 44-45).\nThe Cumberland County PCRA court denied relief, and on appeal, we affirmed. Spotz VI, supra at 266-67.\n. Appellant also asserts that his right to confrontation of the witness was violated. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 26. Because Appellant does not make a distinct and separate argument for this assertion, we likewise do not address it separately from his other claims in this issue.\n. The PCRA court also recognized that Appellant had raised, unsuccessfully, a similar claim in his collateral appeal from his Schuylkill County first-degree murder conviction. PCRA Court Opinion at 12-13 (citing Spotz V, 896 A.2d at 1214-17). In Spotz V, supra at 1217, this Court concluded that Appellant had presented no evidence to support his claim that Ms. Noland had entered into an agreement with the Commonwealth whereby she would testify against Appellant in his Schuylkill County murder trial in exchange for a more lenient sentence.\n. Respectively, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2502(a), 2502(b); 2901(a)(2), (3); 3702(a); 2902(a)(1); 3921(a); 3925(a); and 903.\n. Contrary to Appellant's statement, Ms. Noland was not charged with third-degree murder in York County.\n. The prosecutor objected to Appellant\u2019s comment on sentencing, stating that the court had complete discretion with regard to sentencing, and the total maximum sentence for all the crimes with which Noland was charged exceeded her lifetime. N.T. Trial, 4/22/96, at 1926-27. In response, the court simply stated that it would charge the jury with regard to the maximum sentences. Id. at 1927.\n. In granting Noland\u2019s motion to withdraw her guilty plea, the trial court concluded as follows: \"Here, the Commonwealth chose to try Mark Spotz [Appellant] alone, without having secured a plea of guilty from Defendant Noland. In doing so, the Commonwealth must have contemplated the possibility that a separate trial of defendant Noland would be necessary if Noland did not enter a plea of guilty after the trial of Spotz and the Commonwealth cannot now claim that it is prejudiced by the prospect of that trial.\u201d Commonwealth v. Noland, No. 1448 CA 1995, Opinion, filed 4/28/97, at 4 (York County Court of Common Pleas) (Defendant\u2019s PCRA Exhibit 42).\n. In fact, evidence proffered by Appellant in Spotz V, 896 A.2d at 1216-17, his Schuylkill County PCRA appeal, refutes his assertion that the Commonwealth promised Ms. Noland a lenient sentence. In Spotz V, Appellant proffered a transcript of Ms. Noland\u2019s testimony at a hearing held in York County on October 7, 1996, to consider her petition to withdraw her guilty plea. Id. At that hearing, Ms. Noland testified that she had no idea how long her sentence could possibly be at the time she pled guilty, and she confirmed that the prosecutor never made any promises to her about her sentence. Id. As we concluded in Spotz V, supra at 1217, Appellant \"has not presented this Court with any evidence that Noland and the Commonwealth had entered into an agreement whereby Noland would testify against [Appellant] in exchange for a more lenient sentence.\u201d\n. In the instant York County collateral appeal, Mr. Carothers is referred to as \"Carlos Carothers\u201d in the notes of testimony. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/11/08, at 462. However, in the same notes of testimony, reference is made to a declaration that was signed by Mr. Carothers as \u201cCharles L. Carothers.\u201d Id. at 481-82; Declaration of Charles Lee Carothers, Jr., dated 2/1/07 (Defense PCRA Exhibit 75). At trial, Mr. Carothers was called \"Charles Carothers.\u201d N.T. Trial, 4/16/96, at 1021. In Appellant\u2019s Cumberland County collateral appeal, Mr. Carothers was referred to as \"Charles Carothers.\u201d See Spotz VI, supra at 269. It is clear from the record that Carlos Carothers and Charles Carothers are one and the same person.\n. In Appellant\u2019s collateral appeal of his first-degree murder conviction in Cumberland County, he also raised a Brady claim concerning the involvement of Carothers in the murder of Thompson. See Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 277. On appeal, we held that the involvement of Carothers in the murder of Thompson was \"a matter of pure conjecture!, as Carothers] was not arrested for, not charged with, not tried for, not convicted of\u201d that murder. Id.\n. The Amstutz murder and the Thompson murder took place in Cumberland County, where they were prosecuted. Appellant provides no evidence to indicate that the York County District Attorney's Office had any authority to make agreements regarding prosecution or lack thereof in these Cumberland County cases. To the contrary, Christy Fawcett, one of the York County prosecutors in Appellant's case, testified at his PCRA hearing that she had authority to make agreements only with respect to York County charges. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/11/08, at 439.\n. In Appellant's Statement of Questions Presented, see Appellant's Brief at 1, Issue 3, he also avers that the Commonwealth \"in bad faith destroyed its notes of its interview with Carothers in which the offer had been tendered.\u201d Appellant's \"development\u201d of this issue consists, in its entirety, of the following two sentences set forth in a footnote:\nMs. Fawcett [one of the York County prosecutors in Appellant\u2019s case] testified she could not recall the details of the Carothers interview. She conceded that she \"probably\u201d took notes of the interview, NT [PCRA Hearing] 6/9-13/08, 430, but indicated that the notes were likely destroyed and claimed she had no burden to retain them because they were work-product. [Id.]\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 31 n. 19.\nPCRA counsel referred to the notes several times in his questioning of Ms. Fawcett. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/11/08, at 430-32, 434, 440-41, 445. Ms. Fawcett testified that her notes were likely destroyed when she left the district attorney\u2019s office, but that, in any event, she was not required to disclose them because they were attorney work product. Id. at 430-31. Appellant\u2019s bald assertions that the notes contained information relevant to an alleged offer extended to Carothers and were destroyed in bad faith by the Commonwealth are nothing short of rank speculation, supported by no evidence whatsoever. Because Appellant fails to present any facts, any argument, or any citation to authority with respect to this sub-claim, it is not reviewable.\n. Appellant raised similar issues in the collateral appeals of his Cumberland County and Schuylkill County murder convictions. See Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 264-65, and Spotz V, 896 A.2d at 1217-19, respectively. In both of these cases, the PCRA court rejected Appellant\u2019s claims, and we affirmed.\n. The Commonwealth argues that Appellant is precluded from raising an ineffectiveness claim related to the failure to present a diminished capacity defense because he represented himself during the guilt phase of trial. However, Appellant's ineffectiveness claim focuses on the investigation of a diminished capacity defense, which would have occurred during the pre-trial period, when Appellant was represented by counsel. Accordingly, we do not conclude that this claim is barred by Appellant\u2019s self-representation during the guilt phase of trial.\n. Mr. Maldanado testified for the Commonwealth at Appellant\u2019s trial, and his testimony at that time was similar in many respects to his PCRA testimony. Specifically, Mr. Maldanado testified that Appellant had in his possession, on the morning of February 2, 1995, women\u2019s rings and credit cards; that Appellant was attempting to find a woman to help him use the credit cards to buy items; that Maldanado had offered to buy the rings, but Appellant did not wish to sell them for less than fifty dollars; that Appellant also had a gun in his possession, regarding which he commented that it was \"dropping them like flies;\u201d that Appellant sought Maldanado's help for a bullet wound in the leg and two stab wounds in the back and shoulder, but would not go to the hospital because he was \"wanted\u201d for homicide in Schuylkill County; that, despite his wounds, Appellant \"was walking okay;\u201d and that Appellant was clean and shaven. N.T. Trial, 4/16/96, at 991-97.\nHowever, in his trial testimony, Mr. Maldanado neither mentioned any drug or alcohol use by Appellant nor suggested that he was mentally impaired or incapacitated in any way. In fact, on cross-examination, when Appellant asked Maldanado if Appellant was unaffected by his wounds, Maldanado answered as follows:\nYou [Appellant] was walking okay. We climbed over that fence, and you shook my hand okay. It didn\u2019t seem to me that you were affected by it [the gunshot and stab wounds].\nId. at 1008.\nMaldanado\u2019s trial testimony was generally consistent with a statement he made to police on February 17, 1995. See General Investigation Report, Trooper Stephen J. Caruso, dated 2/17/95 (cited in Appellant\u2019s Brief at 33 as Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 98). However, in his statement to police, Maldanado relayed not only Appellant's statement that he was wanted in Schuylkill County for murder, but also another statement that Appellant had \" 'emptied a clip\u2019 into another person.\u201d Id. at 1.\nThus, Mr. Maldanado\u2019s trial testimony and pre-trial statement to police, like his PCRA testimony, did not in any way suggest an image of Appellant as one who was intoxicated such that he was \"overwhelmed to the point of losing his faculties and sensibilities.\u201d Hutchinson, 25 A.3d at 312.\n. Appellant also cites the testimony or statements of four other individuals to support his claim. See Appellant's Brief at 32-33. This evidence is likewise not relevant to a voluntary intoxication defense. At Appellant\u2019s PCRA hearing, Detective Jeffrey Franks testified that he recognized as drug paraphernalia certain items that were recovered from the ceiling of the hotel room where Appellant was apprehended. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/10/08, at 309-15. Also at the PCRA hearing, Daniel Hogan testified that he regularly used drugs with Appellant and saw Appellant use marijuana, cocaine, acid, and alcohol on multiple occasions; however, Hogan last saw Appellant either three or four days, or perhaps a couple of weeks, before the murders. Id., 6/13/08, 711-20. Finally, Appellant cites statements of Malissa Chirdon and Linda Chirdon, neither of whom testified at the PCRA hearing. Their statements are not included in the record, but from Appellant\u2019s summary, it is clear that neither individual had information as to Appellant's drug or alcohol use at the time of the murders.\n. Appellant also asserts prosecutorial misconduct in Issue 5. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 1 (Statement of Questions Presented). However, Appellant presents no argument for, and indeed does not even mention, prosecutorial misconduct in the Argument section of Issue 5. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 34-37. All of Appellant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct are addressed in Issue 6. See text, infra.\n. The PCRA court did not explain its holding, nor individually mention or discuss, the two distinct sub-issues in Issue 5.\nAppellant notes that sub-issue (a), i.e., the instruction as to possible sentences for murder, was raised in his Amended Petition, claim VIII. See Appellant's Brief at 34 n. 12. However, he does not point out where the second sub-issue was raised, and it is not clear from our review of the voluminous record that this sub-issue was in fact raised before the .PCRA court. See Pa.R.A.P. 2117(c) and 2119(e) (requiring a specific reference to the places in the record where a matter appears in order to show that it was properly raised below and hence is preserved for appeal). As we discuss in the text, infra, sub-issue (b) was litigated on direct appeal and thus is not cognizable under the PCRA.\n. In an attempt to avoid waiver of this sub-issue, Appellant makes the bald assertion that direct appeal counsel could have raised it under the relaxed waiver rule. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 35. Under relaxed waiver, this Court retained the discretion to review unpreserved issues in capital appeals. See, e.g., Fletcher III, 986 A.2d at 775 n. 18. Although the relaxed waiver doctrine was abrogated with respect to PCRA appeals and direct appeals in, respectively, Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 554 Pa. 31, 720 A.2d 693 (1998), and Commonwealth v. Freeman, 573 Pa. 532, 827 A.2d 385, 403 (2003), at the time of Appellant\u2019s trial, the doctrine was in effect.\nAppellant fails to develop an argument to support his assertion that this Court would have reviewed, under relaxed waiver, the claim he raises here. Furthermore, Appellant fails to consider this Court\u2019s holding in Fletcher III, where a PCRA appellant sought review of claims of ineffectiveness for failing to raise on direct appeal several unpreserved claims of trial court error that had arisen during a period of the appellant\u2019s self-representation. Id. at 774-79. The Fletcher III appellant argued that his claims were reviewable under the relaxed waiver doctrine that was in effect at the time he waived his right to counsel. We disagreed and declined to review his unpreserved claims under the relaxed waiver doctrine. Id. at 779. With this holding, we reiterated our concern that, were we to permit a pro se defendant to raise his own ineffectiveness, he could guarantee himself a new trial by intentionally being ineffective, thereby making a mockery of the judicial system. Id. (citing Bryant, 855 A.2d at 736-37). We also recognized that allowing the Fletcher III appellant to invoke the relaxed waiver doctrine and thus obtain review of his claim of appellate counsel ineffectiveness would completely undermine our holdings in Bryant, supra, and Fletcher II, supra. See Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 278 (discussing Fletcher III in the context of a claim raised by Appellant in his collateral appeal from his Cumberland County murder conviction).\nIn relying on Fletcher III to reject Appellant\u2019s invocation of relaxed waiver, we do not ignore our holding in Commonwealth v. Williams, 594 Pa. 366, 936 A.2d 12, 24, 26 (2007), where we concluded that direct appeal counsel was ineffective for failing to invoke relaxed waiver to secure review of a claim that implicated the appellant's actual innocence of a racketeering charge. Here, however, Appellant\u2019s claim does not implicate actual innocence, and we have no difficulty concluding that we would not have accepted it for review under the relaxed waiver doctrine.\n. Appellant has failed to comply with Pa.R.A.P. 2119(a): \"The argument shall be divided into as many parts as there are questions to be argued....\u201d Appellant raises eleven questions in his Statement of Questions Presented. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 1-2; see also footnote 4, supra (reproducing verbatim Appellant\u2019s eleven issues). However, the argument section of Appellant's brief has twelve parts. Appellant raises allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in part six as well as part seven of his argument section. The misconduct alleged in part six of Appellant\u2019s argument section took place during the guilt phase of trial, and thus is not even encompassed within the statement of Issue 6, where Appellant claims prosecutorial misconduct in the penalty phase. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 1, Issue 6. We address all of Appellant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct, whether in the guilt or penalty phase, under Issue 6.\n. As revealed by the transcript, the incident was as follows:\nAppellant: ... I request[e]d to use [a photograph of Christina No-land] as an exhibit and I asked to see it. And I would like to see it now to know if I want to use it.\nMr. Rebert: That\u2019s the photograph in the envelope, Your Honor.\nCourt: In the envelope? Where is the envelope? Show it to him.\nMr. Rebert: Stay right here, Jack.\nAppellant: Don\u2019t put your hands on me, Jack. Don't touch me, Mr. Rebert. Hands off. Your Honor, I have attempted to do my best to go through this and be ready for cross-examination. Given the amount of stuff that I have, the best thing I can do would be to go through each \u2014 this is one preliminary hearing transcript. There's a few more. There\u2019s other trial testimony, statements.....\nN.T. Trial, 4/13/96, at 263-64.\n. We reiterate that the prosecutorial misconduct alleged in this first sub-issue occurred during the guilt phase of trial, when Appellant was acting pro se. Although Appellant did not make a formal motion concerning the prosecutor\u2019s alleged physical and verbal harassment, Appellant did bring the matter to the trial court\u2019s attention. See text, supra (quoting from N.T. Trial, 4/18/96, at 1335). Thus, Appellant arguably preserved the matter for review, and we have therefore addressed Appellant's allegations on the merits. The prosecutorial misconduct alleged in the remaining sub-issues of Issue 6 occurred during the penalty phase, when Appellant was represented by counsel.\n. Appellant tries to escape the statutory bar to re-review of this claim by invoking the PCRA testimony of Mr. Rebert, wherein he acknowledged that the comment regarding \"childish things\u201d was a reference to a verse in the Bible, and was a part of his argument urging the jury to reject the mitigating circumstances proffered by Appellant. N.T. PCRA, 9/18/07, at 535. Mr. Rebert\u2019s PCRA testimony has no effect on our analysis or our decision as set forth on direct appeal with regard to this matter, see Spotz II, 756 A.2d at 1164-65, nor does his testimony alter the characterization of this matter as previously litigated.\n. Appellant also alleges in this sub-issue that, during voir dire, the prosecutor \"repeatedly resorted to fear-mongering, inferring that the increasing crime rate was a permissible basis to find death.\" Appellant\u2019s Brief at 40. As an example of this alleged \"fear-mongering,\" Appellant cites the following question asked of a potential juror by the prosecutor:\n[fit\u2019s one thing to be in favor of [the death] penalty. It might be even popular [in] these days of increased crime rates and so forth. It\u2019s yet another thing to stand in a jury box, face the [Appellant], especially when he is representing himself, face the [Appellant] and tell him, I impose the death penalty. Would you be able to do that, sir, if the circumstances were proven to your satisfaction?\nN.T. Voir Dire, 4/8/96, at 213-14.\nIt is abundantly clear that the prosecutor was asking potential jurors to consider not simply their theoretical views on the death penalty, which may have been influenced by any number of societal factors, but, more importantly, their actual ability to impose a sentence of death on a flesh-and-blood human being standing in front of them. There is nothing improper about such a question. Appellant blatantly misconstrues the prosecutor\u2019s words. In addition, we note that both sides accepted into the jury the prospective juror to whom the above question was addressed. Id. at 214.\nFurthermore, Appellant again ignores the fact that he proceeded pro se during voir dire, and he has failed to point out a single instance in which he made a timely objection to this line of questioning by the prosecutor. Thus, the claim is waived, and no derivative claim of ineffectiveness is possible because Appellant proceeded pro se. See text, supra, discussion of Issue 5(a).\n. Appellant also contends in sub-issue (d) that the prosecution elicited inadmissible victim impact evidence, which \u201crepeatedly reminded [the jury] of the [Gunnet] family\u2019s pain.\" Appellant\u2019s Brief at 40. In support of this contention, Appellant cites only two excerpts of the notes of testimony, both from the testimony of Jeffrey Gunnet, the victim's husband. Id. (citing N.T. Trial, 4/12/96, at 123, 125-26). Appellant\u2019s assertions are entirely meritless for a number of reasons.\nAppellant ignores the fact that Mr. Gunnet\u2019s testimony was presented during the guilt phase of trial, when Appellant was proceeding pro se. Appellant did not object to the testimony, and thus he did not preserve his challenge for review. Furthermore, because he was proceeding pro se, no derivative ineffectiveness claim is available to him. See text, supra, discussion of Issue 5(a).\nIn addition, we feel compelled to point out that Appellant has incorrectly characterized Mr. Gunnet\u2019s testimony as victim impact evidence. As this Court has made clear, victim impact testimony is testimony as to the impact of the victim's death on the victim's family. Commonwealth v. Means, 565 Pa. 309, 773 A.2d 143, 158 (2001) (Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court); see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(a)(2) (\"In the sentencing hearing [after a first-degree murder conviction], evidence concerning the victim and the impact that the death of the victim has had on the family of the victim is admissible.\u201d). Mr. Gunnet did not testify as to the impact of his wife\u2019s death on him or on their family. Mr. Gunnet testified about his wife's morning routine, which she followed on the morning of her murder, the last time he saw her alive. N.T. Trial, 4/12/96, at 123-25. Mr. Gunnet explained that she always left their house in the early morning hours during tax season to get to her job at an accounting firm; described the route that his wife always drove from home to her workplace; and identified her car in a Commonwealth photo exhibit, as well as some of her other belongings. Mr. Gunnet testified that when he made his daily routine call to his wife's office at approximately 7:15 on the morning of her murder, he was unable to reach her and became concerned. Id. at 125-30. Mr. Gunnet then described the circumstances under which he learned that his wife was dead. Id. at 131. All of this was factual evidence concerning the victim's activities in the hours before her murder and the identification of her relevant belongings. Appellant's assertion that Mr. Gunnet's testimony constitutes victim impact evidence is simply wrong.\n. In his collateral appeals of his Cumberland County and Schuylkill County first-murder convictions, Appellant raised similar challenges to the Commonwealth's introduction of his prior burglary convictions as evidence in support of aggravating factor 9711(d)(6). See Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 284-85; Spotz V, 896 A.2d at 1240-41 & n. 41, 42. The respective PCRA courts determined, and we affirmed, that there was no merit to Appellant's claims.\n. Appellant also argues in this sub-issue that proof of aggravating factor 9711(d)(6) \"requires that the Commonwealth prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant actually committed the killing, which cannot be established by a guilt-phase verdict that may, as in this case, rest on a jury finding of accomplice or conspiracy liability.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 42 (emphasis in original). Appellant further asserts that counsel were ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s statement of law and for not requiring a clarification of the elements of factor 9711(d)(6). The underlying facts and legal premise behind this claim are the same as in Issue 8; accordingly, we have addressed the claim in that issue. See infra.\n. Appellant also asserts in this sub-issue that the prosecutor offered his personal opinion that the witness was not being truthful and \"inject[ed] not-of-record comments\u201d into the proceeding. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 42-43. These assertions are not explained, not developed, and not supported factually or legally. To the extent that these assertions are comprehensible, they are meritless.\n. Jean Newpher did not testify at the PCRA hearing.\n. Mr. Blocher testified that he met with Taylor Andrews and Kent Watkins, Appellant's counsel in, respectively, his Cumberland County and Schuylkill County first-degree murder trials. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/17/07, at 82. Mr. Blocher also testified that Mr. Andrews found psychologist Dr. Ragusea, who testified as a mitigation expert in all three capital cases. Id. at 86, 95-96. The three defense attorneys also shared an investigator, a retired state trooper who simultaneously investigated both mitigating circumstances and facts relevant to the guilt phase of trial. Id. at 96-97, 101, 105. Finally, Mr. Blocher testified that all institutional records were shared among defense counsel in the three counties as well as with Dr. Ragusea. Id. at 96, 116.\n. The CYS records (Defense PCRA Exhibit 10) proffered by Appellant are in excess of 1,000 pages and primarily concern his brother, Dustin Spotz. The hospital records proffered by Appellant are from three different hospitals, to wit, Warren State Hospital, Clearfield-Jefferson Community Mental Health Center, and Clearfield Hospital. See, respectively, Defense PCRA Exhibits 11, 12, and 21. The first two of these are Dustin\u2019s records, respectively from his 1990 admission to Warren State Hospital because of suicide threats while in the county jail, and from childhood visits to Clearfield-Jefferson Mental Health Center for various behavioral issues. The records from Clearfield Hospital are Appellant\u2019s childhood medical records from 1974 to 1987. These records are, at the very least, similar to records proffered by Appellant to support similar claims in his previous collateral appeals in Cumberland County and Schuylkill County, respectively. See Spotz VI, 18 A.3d at 313 & n. 40; Spotz V, 896 A.2d at 1230-33.\n. Defense counsel called a total of 17 witnesses at the penalty-phase hearing.\n. The Commonwealth objected to Dr. Gelles\u2019s testimony on relevance grounds. The PCRA court sustained the objection, ruling that whether CYS had failed Appellant was a conclusion that a lay person could reach. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/10/08, at 362-63.\nThe PCRA court did make Dr. Gelles\u2019s affidavit, as well as his testimony during Appellant's PCRA proceedings in Cumberland County, part of the record, reminding defense counsel that \u201cif you argue that my exclusion of [Dr. Gelles\u2019s testimony] was improper, you have to show the appellate courts he should be permitted to testify.\u201d Id. at 363-64. As mentioned in the text, supra, Appellant does not challenge the PCRA court's evidentiary ruling with regard to Dr. Gelles, but simply fails to mention it at all.\nIn his affidavit, Dr. Gelles criticizes CYS for repeatedly returning Appellant and Dustin from various placements to their home after inadequate assessments and evaluations and with inadequate services and monitoring. Affidavit of Richard J. Gelles, Ph.D., dated 2/19/07 (Defense PCRA Exhibit 58). We note only that Dr. Gelles's affidavit is not entirely consistent with the testimony of Ms. Muir, the administrator of CYS and caseworker for Appellant and his family. At the PCRA hearing and during the penalty phase of trial, Ms. Muir testified that, when Appellant or Dustin was in placement, she never recommended that either child be returned to his home. N.T.' PCRA Hearing, 6/10/08, at 352-53; N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 203-05, 213-14.\n. Exactly which mitigating factor the Lester appellant invoked with regard to his drug use was not entirely clear.\n. We recognize that this standard appears logically impossible to meet, because, when a penalty hearing is held, the jury has already established that the defendant acted with specific intent to kill. However, as we recently stated in Gibson, 19 A.3d at 529 n. 18, the jury may consider voluntary intoxication of a lesser degree under mitigating factor 9711(e)(8), the \"catchall\u201d mitigator, but consideration of voluntary intoxication under this subsection does not relieve the defendant of proving that he was voluntarily intoxicated at the time of the murder.\n., We also note that much of the PCRA testimony concerning Appellant\u2019s drug and alcohol use, upon which he attempts to rely in this sub-issue, was cumulative of evidence presented during the penalty phase. As we discussed supra, in the first sub-issue of this issue, several penalty-phase witnesses, including Appellant\u2019s mother, testified that Appellant was repeatedly exposed as a young child to drug and alcohol use and abuse in his childhood home. See text, supra; see also N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 122, 143-44 (testimony of Ms. Newpher as to drug and alcohol use in Appellant\u2019s childhood homes and his exposure to such use); id. at 71-72, 85 (testimony of Ms. Redden as to Appellant\u2019s exposure to drugs as a child). Appellant\u2019s stepfather even acknowledged smoking marijuana with Appellant when he was nine or ten years old. Id., 4/24/96, at 254-55. Linda Spotz, Appellant\u2019s wife, testified that he abused drugs, including marijuana, LSD, and crack cocaine, and also that he sold drugs to earn money. Id. at 235-36. Although she disapproved of Appellant\u2019s drug use, she acknowledged that Appellant smoked crack, got high, and drank when \"things were bad\u201d in order \"to cope with life in general.\u201d Id. at 238. She further acknowledged that he was smoking marijuana and using crack cocaine in January 1995. Id. Dr. Ragusea diagnosed Appellant with polysubstance abuse, recognizing his long history of abusing virtually all street drugs. Id. at 306-07. He emphasized Appellant's childhood drug use and exposure, and suggested that these experiences at such an early age made it more likely that Appellant would continue to abuse drugs as an adult and experience behavioral abnormalities. Id. at 304-05. Dr. Ragusea also testified that Appellant reported to him that he had used LSD shortly before the fatal fight with Dustin. Id. at 316-17. The PCRA testimony concerning Appellant\u2019s drug and alcohol usage, as summarized in Issue 4, is largely cumulative of this penalty-phase testimony.\n. The records that Appellant cites are eleven \"family records,\" as follows. See Appellant's Brief at 51 n. 22.\nThree of the eleven records are Dustin's hospital records, as follows: from Clearfield-Jefferson Community Mental Health Center, documenting Dustin\u2019s childhood visits for various behavioral issues (Defense PCRA Exhibit 12); from Conemaugh Valley Memorial Hospital, documenting Dustin\u2019s 1986 admission because of suicide ideations and troubles at home and school (Defense PCRA Exhibit 13); and from Warren State Hospital, documenting Dustin\u2019s 1990 admission because of suicide threats while in the county jail (Defense PCRA Exhibit 11). One record, from Harrisburg State Hospital, concerns a brief commitment of Danny Spotz, Appellant's biological father, in 1971, after he was arrested for possession of narcotics and driving while under license suspension. (Defense PCRA Exhibit 15). He was released from the hospital with a diagnostic impression of \"an inadequate personality with strong oral needs [who] withdraws from the stresses of life through satisfaction of these needs by drug use [and] feels himself a poor example of a male figure. There is no evidence of any psychotic distortion in his thought processes and as a consequence [he] may be released from this hospital.\u201d (Id. at 14.)\nOne record, from Clearfield Hospital, contains Appellant's childhood medical records from 1974 to 1987. (Defense PCRA Exhibit 21). There is one school record, from the George Junior Republic School, a record which concerns only Dustin. (Defense PCRA Exhibit 19). It includes a psychological evaluation of Dustin from August 1984, which noted his \"seething anger,\u201d his depression, his aggression and need for revenge, his emotional instability, his abusive stepfather, and his various placements. The evaluation also concluded that there was no organic impairment evidenced or indicated and Dustin was not felt to be psychotic. (Id., Psychological Evaluation by Carolyn E. Pritchard, Clinical Psychologist, dated 8/6-8/84). The school record also includes a psychiatric evaluation from 1987, in which medication is re-prescribed and structure reinstituted, with the hope that Dustin \"can regroup and be successful once again.\u201d (Id., Psychiatric Evaluation by Carol Maurer, M.D., dated 3/24/87). The psychiatric evaluation notes the following \"Impression:\u201d \"Adjustment reaction of adolescence with disturbance of emotions and conduct[;] Substance abuse, drugs and alcohol);] Has antisocial personality traits.\u201d (Id.)\nThere are three court records, all concerning offenses committed by Dustin, specifically related to assault and related offenses in 1990 in Cumberland County, and to statutory rape and simple assault in 1992 in Adams County. (Respectively, Defense PCRA Exhibits 14 and 18, 17). One record, from 1993 and 1994, concerns Dustin\u2019s imprisonment at SCI-Rockview, and includes reports of his behavioral problems and psychiatric evaluations. (Defense PCRA Exhibit 22). The psychiatric evaluations suggest a diagnosis of adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features, substance abuse, and personality disorder not otherwise specified, with a history of seizure disorder. (Id., Psychiatric Evaluations by Abdollah Nabavi, M.D., dated 10/28/93 and 8/22/94). Finally, one record derives from Appellant\u2019s 1995 incarceration in the Clearfield County Jail following the killings of his brother and the three other victims. (Defense PCRA Exhibit 16). This record consists of numerous medical requests and reports documenting treatment of Appellant\u2019s shoulder and leg injuries sustained in the fight with Dustin as well as treatment for an eye problem. There are no mental health documents in this report.\nAppellant fails to describe, discuss, or even refer to any of these particular records in his argument. He merely lists them all in a footnote with no explanation as to whom they concern, what they entail, or why they are, in his view, significant and relevant. See Appellant's Brief at 51 n. 22.\n. As in Spotz VI, Appellant also invokes in this sub-issue the PCRA testimony of two psychiatrists, Dr. Blumberg and Dr. Fox, both of whom evaluated Appellant and reviewed the records after being retained by PCRA counsel. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 53-55. Appellant\u2019s attempt to rely on the testimony of these experts is unavailing.\nDr. Blumberg, who evaluated Appellant eleven years after the murders, opined that, at the time of the murders, Appellant was suffering from three mental conditions: (1) post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic/severe; (2) personality disorder not otherwise specified with dependent, schizotypal, borderline, and antisocial features; and (3) polysubstance abuse, including marijuana, LSD, cocaine, and methamphetamine. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/18/07, at 315. Dr. Blumberg\u2019s diagnosis of chronic, severe post-traumatic stress disorder is similar to the revised diagnosis that Dr. Ragusea set forth during Appellant's PCRA proceedings. However, the two experts appeared to differ with respect to their personality disorder diagnoses. As we have previously noted, Dr. Blumberg explained in his testimony during Appellant\u2019s Cumberland County PCRA proceedings that personality disorder not otherwise specified is simply the newer term for mixed personality disorder. See Spotz VI, supra at 315 n. 41. Thus, as we concluded in Spotz VI, \"it would appear that the type of personality disorder diagnosed by Dr. Blumberg for purposes of collateral appeal is very similar to the type first diagnosed by Dr. Ragusea, i.e., at the time of trial.\u201d Id. (emphasis in original).\nDr. Fox, who interviewed Appellant five years and again twelve years after the murders, diagnosed Appellant as suffering from the following psychiatric conditions: (1) post-traumatic stress disorder; (2) borderline personality disorder; (3) an obsessive compulsive disorder; and (4) polysubstance dependence in remission. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/9/08, at 36. When asked on direct examination about the difference between himself and Dr. Blumberg with respect to their personality disorder diagnoses, Dr. Fox testified as follows: \u201c[Tjhere is not a significant difference between Dr. Blumberg\u2019s personality disorder diagnosis and mine. We both consider [Appellant] to suffer from a severe personality disorder. It\u2019s really away [sic] to describe.\u201d Id. at 39. Based on the experts' testimony, we fail to see a legally relevant distinction among the personality disorder diagnoses of any of the three mental health experts who testified on Appellant's behalf, nor a distinction that could possibly have been determinative to a jury.\nFurthermore, Appellant has failed to explain how or why or what additional records prompted the revised diagnoses. Only the following exchange addresses this question at all. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Dr. Fox to explain the reason for the difference in his diagnoses versus Dr. Ragusea's initial diagnoses. The following exchange then took place:\nDr. Fox: It [the differing diagnoses reached by him and Dr. Ragusea] was based on additional records and we are different people and, you know, different evaluations.\nProsecutor: But you can\u2019t as you sit here recall what records made the difference?\nDr. Fox: I had more extensive records of the abuse that [Appellant] received in childhood as we have talked about for hours today.\nId. at 156.\nThus, although Dr. Fox attributed the differing diagnoses reached by him and Dr. Ragusea at least partially to the additional records, the only specific records that Dr. Fox could recall that led to this difference of opinion were those addressing further the abuse .of Appellant during his childhood. As we have already discussed, Appellant\u2019s childhood abuse was well documented during the penalty phase of his trial.\n. Appellant also broadly asserts in this sub-claim that the history of mental illness documented for his father, mother, and brother was \u201cimportant mitigation\u201d evidence and \u201calso had an important environmental effect on [Appellant\u2019s] development.\u201d Appellant's Brief at 52. Appellant neither develops these assertions in any meaningful way nor provides any citations to the record to support them. Appellant offers no rationale or argument to support his apparent belief that if only the jurors had heard more evidence of Appellant's family history of mental illness, they would have returned a different verdict, despite the fact that the jurors heard testimony from multiple witnesses regarding Appellant's chronically abusive and violently dysfunctional family; his mother\u2019s depression, instability, and suicide attempts; his absent father and cruelly abusive stepfather; his brother\u2019s violent rages, and CYS's attempts to intervene. Under these circumstances, we conclude that it is virtually inconceivable that additional evidence as to Appellant\u2019s family history of mental illness would have changed the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, there is no merit to Appellant's claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to present such evidence.\n. In Issue 9, Appellant also raises a sixth sub-issue, to wit, that penalty-phase counsel were \"conflicted.\u201d Appellant's Brief at 65. This claim is merely a repetition of Issue 1(a), which we have already addressed thoroughly. See text, supra, Issue 1(a).\n. Appellant also challenges two other hearsay rulings by the trial court, specifically Ms. Redden\u2019s testimony that Dustin had told her that his stepfather hit him and Appellant with a piece of leather that he called \"the enforcer;\" and Ms. Redden's testimony as to what she had heard about abuse by Appellant\u2019s biological father. N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 81 and 89-90, respectively; see Appellant's Brief at 60. However, our review of the notes of testimony reveals that Ms. Redden's testimony regarding these matters was admitted when defense counsel asked a follow-up question.\nImmediately after the trial court\u2019s ruling that what Dustin had told Ms. Redden about being beaten by his stepfather was hearsay, Ms. Redden further testified that Appellant had \"said basically the same thing, that [their stepfather] hit them with the enforcer, which was a thick and wide long piece of leather.\u201d N.T. Penalty Phase, 4/23/96, at 81. This time, the Commonwealth did not object; there was no ruling, hearsay or otherwise; and the testimony was admitted without comment from the prosecutor or the court. Id. at 81. Similarly, immediately after the court sustained the hearsay objection as to what information Ms. Redden had heard about abuse by Appellant's biological father, defense counsel asked Ms. Redden if Appellant had told her of abuse by his biological father. She answered, without objection, that Appellant said his biological father had punched him in the chest. Id. at 89-90. Thus, contrary to Appellant\u2019s assertion, the testimony by Ms. Redden regarding these matters was heard by the jury. There is no arguable merit to his claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to raise an issue of trial court error regarding these matters on direct appeal.\n. The relevant portion of the trial court\u2019s jury charge is as follows:\nWith regard to your determination, you should set aside any feeling or emotion that clouds your judgment just as you did when you reached the initial verdict in this case. Set aside \u2014 Feelings or emotions one way or the other with regard to life or death isn\u2019t [sic] the issue. The issue here is aggravating and mitigating[,] and use your common sense and human judgment in reaching that decision, and emotion is something that you should set aside and use your common sense and your human mind.\nN.T. Penalty Phase, 4/24/96, at 406-07.\n. Recently, and well after Appellant filed his PCRA appeal in this Court, a Superior Court panel filed a memorandum opinion vacating his voluntary manslaughter conviction and remanding for a new trial. See Commonwealth v. Spotz, 43 A.3d 518, 770 WDA 2010 (Pa.Super., filed January 13, 2012). Shortly thereafter, the Commonwealth filed an application for reargument in the Superior Court. On March 13, 2012, Appellant filed with this Court an \u201cApplication Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 2501, for Leave to File Post-Submission Communication in the form of a Motion to Amend Claims and Submit Supplemental Briefing, or Remand to the PCRA Court.\u201d\nWhile the Superior Court\u2019s decision is potentially relevant to Appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence in the instant case, there is, as yet, no final disposition of Appellant's challenge to his voluntary manslaughter conviction because his challenge remains in appellate proceedings. In the event that Appellant\u2019s challenge to his voluntary manslaughter conviction is ultimately successful at the close of appellate review, then and only then would consideration of the implications of that successful challenge be appropriate.\nAs this Court has previously stated,\n[I]f the underlying collateral conviction which forms the basis of an aggravating circumstance found by the jury is ultimately overturned, this Court is not without power to vacate the sentence of death in appropriate circumstances. Nor would we hesitate to stay an execution of sentence pending appellate disposition of the collateral conviction in appropriate circumstances.\nCommonwealth v. Morales, 508 Pa. 51, 494 A.2d 367, 376 (1985).\nAt the present time, because there has not been any final disposition of Appellant\u2019s challenge to his voluntary manslaughter conviction, there is no reason to delay resolution of Appellant's numerous claims presently before this Court, most of which are entirely unrelated to his voluntary manslaughter conviction. Again, Morales, supra, is relevant here:\nAs review of a convicted murder\u2019s sentence of death is one of the most, if not the most, weighty and important appellate tasks this Court is called upon to perform, it would not serve the interests of justice to withhold swift resolution of our review of a sentence of death pending appellate resolution of a collateral conviction. To do so would subject that resolution to the unavoidable delays possible in the appellate process....\nId.\nIf Appellant's challenge to his voluntary manslaughter conviction is ultimately and finally successful, his recourse is to file a second PCRA petition raising a new claim or claims. See Commonwealth v. Lark, 560 Pa. 487, 746 A.2d 585, 588 (2000) (holding that, when an appellant's PCRA appeal is pending, a subsequent PCRA petition cannot be filed until the pending PCRA petition is resolved).\n. The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court is directed to transmit a complete record of this case to the Governor in accordance with 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 971 l(i)."}
