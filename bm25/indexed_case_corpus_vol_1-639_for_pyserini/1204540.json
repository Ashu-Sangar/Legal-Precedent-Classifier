{"id": "1204540", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nPlaintiff corporation brought an action in assumpsit to recover damages in the sum of $4,787.92, with interest thereon from March 10, 1938, based on an alleged breach of contractual relations between it and defendant School District of the Borough of Braddock. No answer was filed by defendant.\nDefendant advertised for bids for plumbing and heating work on a proposed new school building according to plans and specifications prepared and submitted by its architect. Plaintiff\u2019s bid was the lowest of five submitted and considered by the school district and at a meeting of its Board of Directors on February 28, 1938, the following minute was entered: \u201cOn motion of Rod-eras and Polk the plumbing contract be awarded to Wayne Crouse the lowest responsible bidder for the amount of $20,980.00. All ayes.\u201d\nThe school district through its secretary verbally notified the plaintiff to proceed to execute the written contracts prepared and secure materialmen and performance bonds. The officers of plaintiff corporation proceeded to do this the morning after the meeting at which the award was made to it. The Plumbers\u2019 Union protested to the school board that if the school district persisted in the award labor difficulties would be experienced. The secretary and the architect consulted with the plaintiff corporation\u2019s representatives but the latter\u2019s efforts with the union were unsuccessful and the school district was so notified.\nThe following appears on the minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors of the school district held on March 10, 1938: \u201cIt was regularly moved and seconded by Wrobleski and Andolina that the action of the board in awarding the plumbing contract of the Junior High School Building to Wayne & Crouse, Inc., on February 28, 1938, be rescinded because of the finding after investigation that they are not the lowest responsible bidder, in that they cannot perform the said contract. All ayes. On motion of Wrobleski and Polk the plumbing contract be given to the next lowest bidder, W. J. Costello for the sum of $21,285.00. Ayes: Andolina, Polk, Schweinberg, Wrobleski and Carr. Nays, Roderas. Not voting, Mrs. Gilmore.\u201d\nThe secretary of the School Board then promptly notified the plaintiff corporation of the action of the Board in a letter which stated, inter alia: \u201cYou of course are familiar with the reasons that necessitated this action on the part of the Board.\u201d\nIt is admitted that there was no formal written contract executed by the school district and plaintiff company, but the latter contended that the motion awarding the plumbing contract to \u201cWayne Crouse\u201d sufficiently established a contract between it and the school district, for the reason that the form of the contract later to be executed was attached to the specifications upon which the plaintiff bid. Plaintiff alleged further \u201cthat the action and resolution rescinding the award by and contract of the defendant, and the granting of a new award, was illegal, void and not based upon any fact or right in the defendant,\u201d and that \u201cby reason of the defendant\u2019s breach of its contract . . . the plaintiff has sustained damages in the loss of profits it would otherwise have earned in the erection and construction of the said plumbing work in the sum of $4,787.92.\u201d\nA hearing was held before a jury on September 30, 1940, and after the plaintiff presented its case, defendant moved for a compulsory nonsuit. The court below refused this motion, after which defendant introduced no testimony and rested. The court then affirmed defendant\u2019s point for binding instructions. Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial was refused and this appeal followed.\nThe question before us is ruled by our decision in Chilli v. McKeesport School District, 334 Pa. 581, 6 A. 2d 99. There we said: \u201cThe [School] Code seems to provide that a written contract is necessary to bind the school board.\u201d Appellant argues that what this court said in that case about the School Code requiring written contracts is \u201cobiter dicta.\u201d Without discussing that argument, the question of the requirement by the School Code of written contracts in cases like the present one, is now squarely before us and we do decide that written contracts are required and that this requirement was not complied with by the formal award, as shown by the minutes of the School Board, of \u201cthe plumbing contract to Wayne Crouse the lowest responsible bidder for the amount of $20,980.00.\u201d Even if the award had been made to \u201cWayne Crouse, Inc.,\u201d (the appellant here), appellant would be in no better position than it now is.\nThe references to \u201ccontracts\u201d and the \u201cexecution of contracts\u201d and the attesting by the secretary \u201cin writing the execution of all deeds, contracts, reports, and other instruments that are to be executed by the board,\u201d made in footnotes to this court\u2019s opinion on pages 583-84 of the Chilli case, supra, indicate the statutory foundations for our conclusions that school boards can bind their districts (other than districts of the first class) to monetary obligations exceeding $300.00 only by written contracts. The wisdom of this public policy has received due legislative recognition.\nWilliston on Contracts, Revised Edition, Yol. 1, section 31, says, inter alia: \u201cIn the formation of public contracts the formalities required by law or by the request for bids, such as a written contract, or the furnishing of a bond, often indicate that even after acceptance of the bid no contract is formed, until the requisite formality has been complied with.\u201d\nWhen a municipal body advertises for bids for public work and receives what appears to be a satisfactory bid, it is within the contemplation of both bidder and acceptor that no contractual relation shall arise therefrom until a written contract embodying all material terms of the offer and acceptance has been formally entered into. The motion whose adoption is evidenced by tbe minutes of tbe sebool district in tbe instant case meant merely that tbe proposal was accepted subject to tbe preparation and execution of a formal contract or subject to tbe motion being rescinded before tbe contract was executed. A preliminary declaration of intention to enter into a formal contract, wbicb was all tbe motion adopted amounted to, did not in any way limit tbe sebool directors\u2019 freedom of future action.\nTbe judgment is affirmed."}
