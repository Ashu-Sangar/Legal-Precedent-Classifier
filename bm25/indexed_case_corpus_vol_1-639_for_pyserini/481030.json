{"id": "481030", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nFor more than 20 years, the Commonwealth has, pursuant to a 1954 court order, defrayed the costs of care of Alfred Downing, an incompetent committed to Farview State Hospital. The Commonwealth seeks to recover from the incompetent\u2019s estate the cost of his maintenance since his commitment. The orphans\u2019 court of Westmoreland County denied the Commonwealth\u2019s claim. The Commonwealth appealed. We hold that the Commonwealth is bound by the unappealed and unmodified 1954 order and may not recover its expenditures from the estate. We affirm.\nIn April, 1954, Downing was arrested and charged with the murder of his wife. The Commonwealth did not prosecute him for the crime. Instead, upon the petition of the warden supervising Downing\u2019s incarceration pending trial, the Court of Quarter Sessions appointed two doctors who examined Downing and found him to be psychotic with criminal tendencies. They recommended that Downing be committed to Farview State Hospital. The court adopted this recommendation and on June 3, 1954, committed Downing pursuant to the Mental Health Act of 1951. The commitment order provided inter alia:\n\u201cNow, June 3, 1954, it is ordered and directed that Alfred Downing be committed to the Farview State Hospital to be there detained and treated as an insane person at the expense of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania until further order of the Court; and this shall be sufficient warrant for said commitment.\u201d\nIn a subsequent order the court appointed a guardian for the incompetent\u2019s estate.\nIn 1965, the Commonwealth filed a petition in the court of common pleas asserting that the estate was indebted to the Commonwealth for the cost of the incompetent\u2019s care since his commitment. The court transferred the claim to the orphans\u2019 court. There the case languished until 1972, when the guardian filed a first and partial account. The court in its adjudication denied the Commonwealth\u2019s claim.\nThe Mental Health Act of 1951, pursuant to which Downing was committed, provided that the committing court should determine at the time of commitment who was to bear the cost of the incompetent\u2019s care. The statute thereby relieved the incompetent\u2019s family and the guardian of his estate of the uncertainty as to liability for the incompetent\u2019s maintenance.\nThe committing court was first to consider whether the means of the incompetent and of his family were sufficient to pay the maintenance of the incompetent in the institution. The court was then to decide whether the incompetent\u2019s estate, his family, or the Commonwealth should bear the expense of his care and to frame an appropriate order for maintenance. Such an order was to have the effect of a judgment. If the court ordered the Commonwealth to maintain the patient and the Department of Revenue subsequently discovered that the estate of the incompetent or his family were financially capable of paying for the incompetent\u2019s care, the Act provided a procedure by which the Commonwealth could petition the court for a modification of its order.\nIn this case, the Commonwealth did not seek revision of the cost of maintenance provision of the commitment order. Nevertheless, it contends that the estate of the incompetent is liable for the cost of his care since commitment. The Commonwealth argues that at common law and in all mental health acts the estate of the incompetent is primarily liable for the incompetent\u2019s maintenance. The Commonwealth further argues that no act of the Legislature has ever relieved the estate of this responsibility. It therefore concludes that the committing court\u2019s order on cost of maintenance could not in any way release the estate from its liability.\nWere the Commonwealth\u2019s theory to prevail, it would in effect permit the Commonwealth to relitigate a 20-year old order. The Commonwealth failed to follow the statutory procedure for modification of the original order. If the Commonwealth believes that the order improperly disposed of the issue of Downing\u2019s maintenance, its remedy is to seek a modification of the order. Until it obtains such a modification, the mandate of the court must be obeyed. The Commonwealth is thus precluded from recovering the cost of the incompetent\u2019s maintenance incurred in compliance with that order. See Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307, 87 S.Ct. 1824, 18 L.Ed.2d 1210 (1967); Philadelphia Marine Trade Association v. International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, 453 Pa. 43, 308 A.2d 98 (1973). Any other result would deny the committing court\u2019s order the finality mandated by the Act. Although the Act of 1951 has since been repealed, the validity of orders issued under that Act was in no sense undermined by the repeal.\nThe Commonwealth argues it was not a party to the commitment proceeding and, therefore, is not bound by the court\u2019s direction to pay maintenance. In the circumstances of this case, we cannot agree.\nThe person petitioning the court for the commitment of another pursuant to the Act of 1951 must be viewed as a party to the commitment proceeding. In this case, the warden of the county jail, acting as custodian of the prisoner and performing a state function submitted the petition, and was therefore a party in his official capacity. He represented the Commonwealth. Moreover, the Commonwealth in compliance with the order of court, received, housed and maintained the incompetent in a state facility. Therefore, the Commonwealth is plainly bound by the court\u2019s determination that the means of the incompetent were insufficient to support his care and that the Commonwealth must bear the cost. Restatement of Judgments \u00a7 85, comment a at 403 (1942). See Consumer Party v. Tucker, 364 F.Supp. 594 (E.D.Pa.1973).\nWe find no more convincing the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that it had no notice of the proceeding. At the time of his commitment to the hospital, the Commonwealth was preparing to prosecute Downing for murder. The commitment was pursuant to the petition of the official charged with Downing\u2019s custody pending trial. His commitment to Farview is part of the custody pending disposition of the criminal charge. On this record, any argument that the Commonwealth was without notice is meritless.\nDecree affirmed.
