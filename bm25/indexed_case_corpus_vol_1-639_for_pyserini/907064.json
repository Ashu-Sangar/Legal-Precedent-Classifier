{"id": "907064", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThere was evidence enough in the testimony of the plaintiff to carry the case to the jury on the question of waiver of notice o\u00ed protest. The court correctly left this question to the jury and they found in favor of the plaintiff. We do not see how they could have found otherwise. The case of Reiff v. McMiller, 45 Legal Int. 26, cited by appellant, has no application. It does not raise the question at issue here.\nJudgment affirmed."}
