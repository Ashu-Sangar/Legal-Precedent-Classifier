{"id": "1785902", "contents": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nThis is a direct appeal from a Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas judgment of sentence for third degree murder. Appellant contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing (1) to request a complete charge on voluntary manslaughter; (2) to request a Bighum hearing to seek suppression of appellant\u2019s prior criminal record for purposes of impeachment or, in the alternative, for failing to counsel appellant in his efforts to decide whether to testify; (3) to object to \u201cprejudicial and improper\u201d remarks in the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument; (4) to object to hearsay testimony; and (5) to investigate the facts of the case, interview potential witnesses, and call witnesses to testify. We have reviewed the record in this case and find appellant\u2019s contentions lack merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\n. We have jurisdiction of this appeal under Section 2 of the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 722, effective June 27, 1978. This statute was amended subsequent to appellant\u2019s conviction."}
