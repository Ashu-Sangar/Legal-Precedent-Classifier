{"id": "903535", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe learned court below was entirely correct in excluding the offers to prove the contents of the alleged second will. There was no sufficient proof of the execution of that will, and hence its contents could not be given in evidence. The reasons for the rulings of the court are sufficiently set forth in the opinion on the motion for a new trial and need not be repeated.\nJudgment affirmed."}
