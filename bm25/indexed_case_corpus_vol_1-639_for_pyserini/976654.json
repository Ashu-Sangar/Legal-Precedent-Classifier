{"id": "976654", "contents": "Per Curiam :\nAn examination of the record in this case has failed to convince us that there is any error therein that requires a reversal or modification of the decree. Neither of the thirty-three specifications of error requires special notice. The controlling questions involved in them are sufficiently presented and properly disposed of in the opinion of the court below.\nDecree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the costs of appellants."}
