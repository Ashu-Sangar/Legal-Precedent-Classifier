{"id": "1100843", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nThis is an appeal from a declaratory judgment of the court below construing the will of Adam J. Black, deceased. The will is that of an uneducated man, written by his own hand and apparently without aid from any outside source; the spelling is somewhat phonetic in form.\nThe sixth paragraph, which contains the bequests now in question, is headed in this manner: \u201cNo. 6 to N W Black and go [i. e. Geo.] D. Black.\u201d Then follows a list of several pieces of realty, after which the will states, on separate lines:\n\u201cOlso Cash 5,000 to each\u201d\n\u201cOlso Cash 5,000 to each\u201d\nThe problem is whether the foregoing language gives to N. W. Black and George D. Black $5,000 each or $10,000 each. The court below concluded that there was a gift of only $5,000 to each of the two, and we agree with this construction.\nIt is apparent from the original will that the words \u201cto each\u201d were added to both of the above lines after the instrument was written. Keeping in mind, as we must, testator\u2019s demonstrated educational handicaps, what intention is indicated by his words and acts? In the preceding portion of the paragraph he had devised real estate to N. W. Black and George D. Black, as tenants in common; the money, however, he wanted to give in severalty, and he set about to express this thought. At first, he wrote \u201cOlso Cash 5,000,\u201d duplicating the language on the next line, no doubt with the intention of expressing that each of the legatees provided for in the particular item which he was then engaged in writing was to receive a separate gift of $5,000. Sometime afterward, \u2014 we cannot tell when,\u2014 apparently feeling that this form was inadequate to show his intention that \u201ceach\u201d was to get $5,000 separately, he added the words \u201cto each,\u201d not with any intention, we believe, of altering the bequest, but, as we have said, in an effort to make clear his desire that each of the two legatees should receive $5,000, separately, as distinguished from the manner in which they were to take the real estate previously given in common.\nWe need not, however, rest our decision on the foregoing theory, since, if the will be read as repeating a $5,000 provision for each legatee, there is a principle of law directly applicable here, which dictates that the second provision shall be read as merely repetitious, and of no avail. In Kessler\u2019s Estate, 288 Pa. 91, we very recently said, \u201cIn the absence of internal evidence of intent, the following rules of construction have been generally adopted to determine whether a legacy be cumulative or substitutional......2. Where two legacies of quantity of equal amount are bequeathed to the same legatee in one and the same instrument, the second bequest is regarded as mere repetition and the beneficiary takes but one legacy.\u201d The will before us contains no internal evidence which in any way weakens the applicability of this principle to the present case. What evidence there is, as we have above pointed out, leads to the same conclusion that follows from the rule stated.\nThe judgment is affirmed, costs to be paid out of the estate."}
