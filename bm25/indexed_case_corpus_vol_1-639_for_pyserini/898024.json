{"id": "898024", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThere appears to be no substantial error in the learned auditor\u2019s findings of fact; and, upon the material facts thus established, the residue of the fund in court, after deducting costs and expenses, was rightly awarded to Magill, the original execution creditor. While the evidence may not warrant the conclusion that all the parties in interest actually requested the sheriff to sell the horses and pay into court the proceeds, for distribution, etc., it is very evident, from what occurred at the time of the sale that they knew this was to be done, and at least tacitly acquiesced therein. The sheriff\u2019s auctioneer distinctly announced, at the sale, \u201c that the purchasers would have to pay cash for the horses, .... the money would have to be turned into court.\u201d\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
