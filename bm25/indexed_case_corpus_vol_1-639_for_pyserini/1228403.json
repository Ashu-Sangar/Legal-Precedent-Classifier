But, a majority of the members of the court who heard the argument of this appeal are of the opinion that the case could not properly have been taken from the jury. Consequently, the learned court below was correct in refusing the defendant\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. The judgment for the plaintiff is affirmed on the opinion of Judge Guerin for the court en banc.\nJudgment affirmed."}
