{"id": "1933888", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nAlvin C. Gray, appellant, and one John Stephens were indicted in Delaware County for murder, voluntary manslaughter and conspiracy in connection with the fatal stabbing of Emanuel Brown on January 12, 1969, in Darby Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania. Each was tried separately and Stephens, who was tried first, was acquitted of all charges. Thereafter, the trial of Gray commenced, with the jury ultimately rendering a verdict of guilty of second degree murder. Motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial was made and denied by order of court filed November 24, 1969. Gray was sentenced on December 5, 1969, to a term of seven and one-half to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment. This appeal followed.\nWhile the testimony of the various witnesses was contradictory, it appears to us that on the fatal date the appellant and Stephens were wandering on \u201cforeign turf.\u201d They were met by decedent Brown and a Milton Gans and words were exchanged. Subsequently, ten to thirteen boys, led by the victim, began to chase and throw bricks at Gray and Stephens. Eventually, a hand-to-hand encounter ensued between the victim and Stephens. According to appellant\u2019s testimony, he later joined the fray and succeeded only in punching the victim while being knocked unconscious by a brick and waking up some distance away.\nIn support of his alternative motions, appellant advances six contentions: (1) the evidence was insufficient to sustain the verdict of second-degree murder; (2) it was error for the trial judge to refuse to charge on self-defense or defense of another; (3) the trial judge placed undue emphasis upon the definition of the various degrees of murder, thereby prejudicing appellant; (4) it was error for the trial judge to refuse to charge that the previous acquittal of Stephens was evidence sufficient to impeach the credibility of an eyewitness; (5) the trial judge erred in ordering the closing argument to be made first by the appellant without a later opportunity to rebut the Commonwealth\u2019s later closing argument; and (6) the prosecutor should have been directed to call an eyewitness. The additional facts necessary for a complete understanding of these issues will be developed in this opinion.\nIn support of his first contention, appellant basically argues that the inconsistencies and variances among the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses as to specific details demonstrate the insufficiency of the evidence upon which the conviction was based. However, variances in testimony or the fact that witnesses may have made contradictory statements goes to credibility and not to sufficiency. Com. v. Osborne, 433 Pa. 297, 249 A. 2d 330 (1969). \u201c[I]n determining the sufficiency of the evidence, be it direct or circumstantial, the test is whether, accepting as true all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences arising therefrom, upon which if believed the jury could properly have based its verdict, it is sufficient in law to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime or crimes of which he has been convicted: Com. v. Commander, 436 Pa. 532, 260 A. 2d 773 (1970).\u201d Com. v. Myers, 439 Pa. 381, 383-84, 266 A. 2d 756 (1970). Accord, Com. v. Winebrenner, 439 Pa. 73, 265 A. 2d 108 (1970). Of course, the record must be considered and read in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth.\nAt trial, both Gray and Stephens unequivocally denied doing the stabbing and denied any possession of a knife. On the other hand, while there was conflicting testimony by the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses as to whether Stephens or Gray stabbed the victim, all agreed that Gray did have a knife. In any event, it was not necessary, under the circumstances, for the Commonwealth to offer proof which would exclude the possibility that Stephens alone committed the fatal stabbing in order to prove Gray\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Com. v. Kravitz, 400 Pa. 198, 161 A. 2d 861 (1960). Viewing all the evidence presented, the jury could find not only that Gray stabbed the victim but also that he did so maliciously. Cf. Com. v. Winebrenner, 439 Pa. 73, 265 A. 2d 108 (1970); Com. v. Commander, 436 Pa. 532, 260 A. 2d 773 (1970). Read in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we find the evidence sufficient to support a conviction of murder in the second degree.\nSecondly, appellant alleges it was error for the trial judge to refuse to instruct on self-defense or defense of another. \u201cThe following conditions must be satisfied before one can successfully invoke the defense of self-defense: 17 P.L.E. Homicide \u00a7\u00a745, 46; C. J.S. Homicide \u00a7114. (1) The slayer must have been free from fault in provoking or continuing the difficulty which resulted in the killing: Commonwealth v. Minoff, 363 Pa. 287, 69 A. 2d 145 (1949). (2) The slayer must have reasonably believed that he was in imminent danger of death, great bodily harm, or some felony, and that there was a necessity to Mil in order to save himself therefrom: Commonwealth v. Collazo, 407 Pa. 494, 180 A. 2d 903 (1962) ; Commonwealth v. Miller, 313 Pa. 567, 170 A. 128 (1934); Commonwealth v. Russogulo, 263 Pa. 93, 106 A. 180 (1919). (3) The slayer must not have violated any duty to retreat or avoid the danger: Commonwealth v. Collazo, supra; Commonwealth v. Johnson, 213 Pa. 432, 62 A. 1064 (1906); Commonwealth v. Breyessee [160 Pa. 451, 28 A. 824 (1894)].\u201d Commonwealth v. Johnston, 438 Pa. 485, 489, 263 A. 2d 376, 379 (1970). Although the case law is scant, this Court has recognized the limited doctrine of defense of another. See Com. v. Russogulo, 263 Pa. 93, 106-07, 106 A. 180, 185-86 (1919).\nHowever, it is irrelevant whether the accused fits within either of these categories for it must be remembered that the appellant steadfastly denied in his testimony that he stabbed the victim. In Com. v. Pavillard, 421 Pa. 571, 220 A. 2d 807 (1966), error was alleged in the trial judge\u2019s refusal to charge the jury on the law regarding homicide by misadventure (mistake) even though the accused denied any complicity in the homicide. To paraphrase the language of the Pavillard opinion, appellant\u2019s testimony as to the victim\u2019s death, if believed, would establish that someone else stabbed the victim. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, if believed, shows a homicide committed by Gray. The issues of self-defense or defense of another were not injected into this case at trial by either the Commonwealth or the appellant. That being so, the failure to charge upon the subject was not error. 421 Pa. at 574, 220 A. 2d at 809. An analogous result was reached by the Superior Court as to the privilege to eject trespassers when that right was not relied on by the accused. Com. v. Zubik, 194 Pa. Superior Ct. 248, 166 A. 2d 666 (1960). There is no reason in this particular situation to distinguish the doctrines of self-defense and defense of another from those of homicide by misadventure and the privilege to eject trespassers when the accused does not avail himself of these defenses. \u201cWhere the defense is that the accused did not Mil or participate in the homicide, instruction on self-defense is not necessary.\u201d 41 C.J.S. Homicide \u00a7379 n. 16 (1944).\nMoreover, we have repeatedly held that self-defense is an affirmative defense and that the accused has the burden of proving it by a fair preponderance of the evidence. Com. v. Winebrenner, 439 Pa. 73, 265 A. 2d 108 (1970); Com. v. Johnston, 438 Pa. 485, 263 A. 2d 376 (1970); Com. v. Commander, 436 Pa. 532, 260 A. 2d 773 (1970). Since Gray has specifically denied the stabbing, he certainly could not sustain this burden and thereby avail Mmself of tMs defense. Accordingly, the refusal to so charge was not error.\nAppellant next argues that the trial judge placed undue emphasis upon the definition of the various degrees of homicide to the prejudice of the accused. Our reading of the record demonstrates that the trial judge initially defined the categories of homicide (ten pages of the record) followed by a review of the evidence (twenty-seven pages of the record). A brief reiteration of hornbook law on the degrees of homicide (one page of the record), along with a reminder of the presumption of innocence, then concluded the charge. It is this brief reiteration of the law involved wMch allegedly prejudiced the appellant, prompting counsel\u2019s objection. Viewing the charge as a whole, we cannot conclude there was undue emphasis engendering any prejudice whatsoever.\nSince Stephens had been acquitted earlier, counsel for the appellant requested the trial judge to charge that tMs acquittal was evidence sufficient to impeach \u2022the credibility of the eyewitness. Appellant\u2019s basis for this argument is certain language in Com. v. Quaranta, 295 Pa. 264, 271, 145 A. 89, 92 (1928) : \u201cFurthermore, the fact of acquittal of a witness [two co-defendants had been acquitted earlier], as shown by verdict and \u25a0judgment, is competent proof to affect the credibility \u2022of eyewitnesses who have testified to witness\u2019s presence at the homicide and participation therein.\u201d We certainly agree that the acquittal is competent proof to affect the credibility; but this language should not be interpreted, as appellant apparently desires, to achieve a result that would require the trial judge to essentially direct the jury to disregard the testimony of the eyewitnesses. The possible bases upon which Stephens was acquitted are myriad. Indeed, Stephens may have been acquitted because his jury may have decided that Gray was the guilty party. There is no merit in this contention.\n. Pa. R. Grim. P. 1116(b) provides: \u201cWhen the evidence is concluded, each party shall be entitled to present one closing argument to the jury. Regardless of the number of defendants, and whether or not a defendant has presented a defense, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall be entitled to make one argument which, shall be made last.\u201d (Emphasis added) Notwithstanding Pa. R. Crim. P. 1116(b), counsel for appellant moved the Court to direct that the order of closing arguments should be as follows: the Commonwealth should make the first opening summation to the jury to be followed by the defense; this speech was to be followed by the final argument of the prosecution) which speech should be limited to a rebuttal of the defense speech only. The trial judge ordered the closing arguments to be made in accord with Pa. E. Crim. P. 1116(b) and the defense now alleges the invalidity of that rule.\nIn support of this motion, appellant cites the practice of several jurisdictions. With all due deference to these other jurisdictions, such procedure is not employed in this Commonwealth. While this Court long ago recognized that the denial of the right of summation by counsel to a criminal jury was an abridgment of the accused\u2019s constitutional right to full representation by counsel, Stewart v. Com., 117 Pa. 378, 11 A. 370 (1887), it nowise follows that the same deprivation occurs involving the order of summation.\nAppellant lastly argues that the prosecution should have been directed to call the victim\u2019s father, an eyewitness, to testify as a Commonwealth witness. At the trial of John Stephens, Mr. William Brown testified that Stephens, with something in his hand, was on top of the victim and, as Stephens stepped away, the victim staggered away from Stephens. At the closing of the prosecution\u2019s case, the district attorney stated he did not intend to call Mr. William Brown whereupon the defense requested a bench warrant for Mr. Brown in order to call him. The defense, however, did not call Mr. Brown; nor was a request made to re-open the case to permit his testimony in defense. \u201cPennsylvania decisions have long recognized that in criminal trials the prosecution is not absolutely bound to call to the stand all available and material eyewitnesses. Commonwealth ex rel. Sprangle v. Maroney, 423 Pa. 589, 225 A. 2d 236 (1967); Commonwealth v. Horn, 395 Pa. 585, 150 A. 2d 872 (1959) ; Commonwealth v. Palermo, 368 Pa. 28, 81 A. 2d 540 (1951) ; Commonwealth v. Deitrick, 221 Pa. 7, 70 Atl. 275 (1908). [Footnote omitted]. On the other hand, a number of decisions clearly indicate that when the Commonwealth does not call to the stand such an eyewitness, it must apprise the defense of the witness\u2019s name and whereabouts at trial, unless the defense is able or should have been able to procure the witness unaided. Commonwealth v. Giacobbe, 341 Pa. 187, 19 A. 2d 71 (1941) ; Commonwealth v. Karamarkovic, 218 Pa. 405, 67 Atl. 650 (1907); Commonwealth v. Danz, 211 Pa. 507, 522, 60 Atl. 1070, 1075 (1905). [Footnote omitted.]\u201d Com. v. Carter, 427 Pa. 53, 54-55, 233 A. 2d 284, 285 (1967). See also, Com. v. Schmidt, 437 Pa. 563, 263 A. 2d 382 (1970). It was alleged in the Commonwealth\u2019s brief and not denied by the appellant that Mr. Brown was intermittently present at trial. Moreover, the witness was under subpoena, his identity disclosed to the defense, and he was available to the defense upon the issuance, at its request, of a bench warrant. Thus, Mr. Brown was available to the defense attorney and, if he wanted him, all he had to do was call him. There is no error.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nGray was found not guilty of voluntary manslaughter and a directed verdict of not guilty of conspiracy was entered.\nWhile we said in Com. v. Beach, 438 Pa. 37, 40, 264 A. 2d 712, 714 (1970) : \u201cIn a case where there is any evidence which might lead a jury to conclude that a killing occurred through legal misadventure, a charge as to the applicable law is essential,\u201d that case is clearly inapposite as the accused there testified that a struggle between him and another resulted in the stabbing of a third person.\nUpon being informed of this objection at side-bar, the trial judge responded, \u201cYou\u2019re objecting to that?\u201d\nRefusing this request, the court intend charged: \u201cWhen Stephens testified and he said on the witness stand that he was acquitted in a prior trial where he gave the same testimony as to himself in that case. This, the fact of an acquittal, is not substantive evidence of this defendant, Gray\u2019s guilt or innocence in this ease, it only relates to the credibility of the witness, Stephens. It is an indication that he would have no interest for himself in the outcome of the case, but in considering Stephens\u2019 testimony \u00e1s a Whole, you will nevertheless apply what I have said regarding 'this at this point along with the other tests of credibility which I have just outlined to you in determining his credibility.\u201d\nSee generally, Annot., 38 A.L.R. 2d 1396 (1954), as supplemented,"}
