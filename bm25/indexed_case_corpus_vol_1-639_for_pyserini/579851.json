{"id": "579851", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Jones,\nEdward Moeslein (decedent) died, testate, on February 22, 1927, survived by three sons, seven grandchildren and six great grandchildren.\nParagraph Seventh of his will set up a trust of his residuary estate which provided that the income from the trust should be paid to his sons, each son to receive one-third of the income for life and, upon the death of each son, that son\u2019s share should \u201crevert to and become part of the corpus\u201d of the estate. Paragraph Eighth of the will provided that, in the event a son should predecease his wife (i.e., that person who was his wife at the time decedent executed his will), the surviving widow be given $1,500 annually for her support and maintenance \u201cso long as she lives and remains unmarried.\u201d Upon the death or remarriage of such widow, the \u201cannuity\u201d should \u201crevert to and become part of the corpus of [decedent\u2019s] estate.\u201d\nThe crucial portion of this will insofar as this appeal is concerned is paragraph Ninth: \u201cUpon the death of all of my said sons and the death or remarriage of the surviving widows (i.e., the present wives of my sons as of the date of this my will) of my said sons, I give, devise and bequeath the corpus of my estate to my grandchildren, their heirs cmd assigns, sha/re and share alike, absolutely.\u201d (Emphasis added) Decedent\u2019s wife had died twelve years prior to the date of both the will and decedent\u2019s death. All of the decedent\u2019s sons and their wives died on or before October 28, 1968. Of decedent\u2019s seven grandchildren\u2014living at the time decedent died\u2014four are still living; each of the three deceased grandchildren left issue.\nOne of the decedent\u2019s grandchildren, Edward E. Moeslein, left one child, a son, Edward E. Moeslein, Jr. (the present appellant), and had twenty years after decedent\u2019s death been divorced from appellant\u2019s mother and, ten years later, had remarried Lncille Moeslein. Subsequent to his remarriage, Edward K. Moeslein, the grandchild, made a will giving all of his estate, \u201cincluding any right, title or interest given or bequeathed\u201d to him under the decedent\u2019s will, to Lucille Moeslein.\nThe present controversy is between this great grandchild of decedent and his stepmother. The former (appellant) contends that he is entitled to the share which his father would have taken had he been alive when the last survivor of all decedent\u2019s sons and their wives died, to wit, October 28, 1968. The latter (appellee) contends that her deceased husband had an interest which had become vested at the time of decedent\u2019s death to which interest she became entitled under the will of her deceased husband. Basically, the issue is whether the class of remaindermen should be determined as of the date of decedent\u2019s death in 1927 or as of the date of death of the last life tenant in 1968.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County held that Edward K. Moeslein\u2014decedent\u2019s grandson\u2014had received under the will of his grandfather a remainder interest which became vested at the time of decedent\u2019s death in 1927. From that decree the present appeal was taken.\nThe court below, believing that the intent of decedent was not clear in designating when the class of remaindermen was to be ascertained, considered the applicability of a canon of construction set forth in the Act of June 29, 1923, P. L. 914, 21 P.S. \u00a7\u00a711, 12, now repealed by the Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 100, 20 P.S. \u00a7301.20. That canon of construction requires that when property, real or personal, is devised or bequeathed by a will \u201ceither directly or in trust, for the use and benefit of any person . . . for years or for life or upon condition\u201d and the will provides that upon the termination of the estate for years or for life, the remainder over shall vest in \u201cthe donor\u2019s or testator\u2019s heirs or next of ldn or the persons thereunto entitled under the intestate laws, or other similar or equivalent phrase,\u201d that this phrase shall be construed as meaning the persons entitled thereto at the termination of the estate for life.\nTo the contention of appellee that this statute of 1923 did not apply because the interest which immediately preceded final distribution, i.e., the $1,500 annual payment, was not a life estate but an \u201cequitable charge\u201d (see Flinn Estate, 383 Pa. 79, 118 A. 2d 192 (1955)), the court below responded that the interests of the surviving widows and remaindermen in FUnn and those in the instant case were clearly distinguishable. To the contention by the appellant that this statute of 1923 was applicable, the court below held that the testamentary language in this case did not satisfy the requirements of that statute. However, we are of the view that the result reached by the court below was correct in that the interest of Edward ~K. Moeslein in decedent\u2019s estate became vested at the time the will became effective, i.e., at the time of decedent\u2019s death in 1927 and that invocation of the Act of 1923, supra, is unnecessary because a reading of this will reveals the intent of the decedent, if not specifically at least by necessary implication.\nAt the time decedent executed his will he had, in addition to his three sons, seven grandchildren and six great grandchildren, all of whom he knew. In his will he gave the corpus of his estate to his \u201cgrandchildren\u201d and made no mention whatsoever of his then living great grandchildren. True it is that he used the phrase \u201ctheir heirs and assigns,\u201d which would have included grandchildren of any son had such son predeceased the decedent. However, this phrase is not one of purchase but of limitation and describes an absolute and unconditional estate. Moreover, the will expressly provided that the grandchildren would take \u201cshare and share alike,\u201d which clearly indicates that the decedent intended to vest in his grandchildren living at the time of Ms death an equal interest in his estate to be enjoyed after the deaths of decedent\u2019s three sons and their wives. Any doubt as to the nature of the interest to be received by the grandchildren is resolved further by the use of the word \u201cabsolutely,\u201d which unequivocally reveals an intent to make a gift absolute in nature, without condition or contingency, to his grandchildren. At the time of decedent\u2019s death the grandson, Edward 3L Moeslein, had a vested interest which he passed on by will to his wife, Lucille Moeslein.\nDecree affirmed. Costs to be paid by the estate.\nThe share to one son, William Moeslin, was to be held in trust for the support of that son and his wife during the son\u2019s life and, upon the son\u2019s death, for the expense of his \u201cdecent interment.\u201d Any balance of unpaid income was to be kept by the trustees as a separate fund to be paid to that son\u2019s children, \u201cshare and share alike, at the time of the final distribution of [decedent\u2019s] estate.\u201d\nNone of the sons was divorced and none of their wives remarried after their husband\u2019s death.\nThe date of death of the last surviving widow.\nThis statute applies to the wills of persons dying after December 31, 1923, and prior to January 1, 1918.\nThis 1923 statute contains the caveat: \u201cThat nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent any donor or testator from expressly or by necessary implication directing otherwise.\u201d\nThe court below relied, in part, on Jessup Estate, 441 Pa. 365, 276 A. 2d 499 (1970). The language in Jessup was dicta. See Bonsall\u2019s Estate, 288 Pa. 39, 135 A. 724 (1927).\nThat the result of our decision is to pass an interest in his estate to a person who is not of the decedent\u2019s bloodline cannot fault the clearly revealed intent of decedent to vest an interest in Ms grandchildren at the time of his death."}
