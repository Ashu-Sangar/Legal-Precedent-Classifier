{"id": "473165", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Patterson,\nEdward A. Haley was indicted and tried for the murder of one Joseph S. Connor. A jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial was dismissed and he was sentenced to the State Industrial Home for Boys at Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. Appellant contends that the Commonwealth has utterly failed to prove the cause of death and, therefore, the trial judge erred in refusing to direct a general verdict of not guilty.\nOne June 8, 1947, at about 12:00 midnight, a group of young people who had been attending a wedding reception in one of the rooms of a building located at the northeast corner of Eleventh and Spruce Streets in the City of Philadelphia, were standing directly in front of the main entrance of the building waiting for a taxicab. Oscar Haley, father of appellant and caretaker of the building, emerged from the Eleventh Street entrance, approached the group and stated that some glasses and a pitcher had been removed and asked that they be returned. James O\u2019Hara, one of the group, asked Haley if he wanted to search him. Haley had started up the steps and O\u2019Hara followed him, whereupon Haley turned around and struck O\u2019Hara. Haley quickly entered the building and locked the door. Thereupon, about twenty of the group proceeded to the Eleventh Street entrance and saw that this door was also locked. The door was knocked down and four or five of the group entered the building.\nAppellant, 16 years of age, lived with his parents on the fourth floor of this building. When the dispute arose, he heard his mother scream. He stated that he ran \u201cupstairs to the attic and I got my knife and stuck it down my trousers behind my belt and I ran downstairs\u201d. The knife, a Japanese souvenir which appellant had picked up in a junk yard, had a blade 8y2 inches long. Joseph F. Connor, deceased, headed the shouting crowd and advanced upon appellant and his family with a heavy piece of wood which was part of the paneling broken out of the door. Connor was about to strike James Herbert Haley, brother of the appellant, when appellant, in an effort to hold off the crowd, took out the knife and stabbed Connor in the lower left chest between the tenth and eleventh ribs. The blade penetrated Connor\u2019s body 5% inches and pierced his spleen causing it to hemorrhage severely. He was taken to Jefferson Hospital where about five hours later a splenectomy was performed in an unsuccessful effort to stop the hemorrhage. Connor died thirty hours after the stabbing. No autopsy was performed by the coroner\u2019s physician.\nIt is not asserted that appellant did not have a fair trial or that the charge of the trial judge was not fair, full and complete. The sole question before this Court is whether the evidence is sufficient to support a finding that death resulted from the appellant\u2019s wrongful act. Appellant contends that failure of the coroner to perform an autopsy is fatal to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. In other words, it is contended that unless there has been an autopsy which proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the injury and death are directly connected, the latter logically resulting from the former, the trial judge must direct a verdict of not guilty.\nThe corpus delicti in homicide cases may be established without aid of testimony appertaining to a coroner\u2019s autopsy. In Commonwealth v. Scovern, 292 Pa. 26, 33,140 A. 611, this Court said: \u201cCorpus delicti consists of a criminal act, a resulting death, and the agency of the accused in its commission. It must appear that deceased died from the effects of a wound, unlawfully inflicted by the person charged: See Wharton on Homicide, 3d ed., p. 897. All of these elements were present in this case. We need not recite the evidence. Proof of corpus delicti is not weakened by the fact that the medical testimony shows a disease or various diseases, the product of the wound itself, combined to produce death. It was of no consequence that the deceased died of pneumonia or suppurated splenitis, if either were super-induced by the bullet wound, or from the operation deemed necessary to save the victim\u2019s life: Com. v. Eisenhower, 181 Pa. 470.\u201d\nCareful examination of the original record reveals ample evidence from which a jury could properly conclude that death resulted from a criminal act and that appellant was the perpetrator thereof. The fact of death is not in issue. Neither is accused\u2019s criminal act save as it is said not to have been proven as the causal factor of death. Dr. Benjamin Gouley, the coroner\u2019s physician, testified: \u201cThe cause of death was a post-operative complication, post-operative operation following a splenectomy. A splenectomy is an operation for the removal of the spleen. The operation was performed because of a stab wound.\u201d He further testified: \u201cI therefore can say with definiteness that death here was caused finally and ultimately as a result of a stab wound.\u201d Dr. Kenneth Fry, Assistant Professor of Surgery at Jefferson Medical College, the physician who operated on deceased, testified: \u201cQ. In your professional judgment was it necessary to perform the operation? A. It was the only thing that could be done at that time, to operate. Q. Due to what?- A. For a supposed injury of the spleen. Injuries of the spleen hemorrhage severely, so in order to stop the hemorrhage and save life, we operated. Q. So, in an attempt to save this man\u2019s life the operation was performed? A. That is correct. Q. Will you please tell us what you learned as a result of the operation? A. Yes, sir. We learned, first of all, that a wound went completely through the spleen, that is, both front and back. . . . Right through the spleen. The diaphragm on that side, which is the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen, had a laceration in it, an opening in it, and then the wound of the chest wall communicated directly into the chest cavity through the diaphragm and through the spleen. Q. That was what you learned and discovered as a result of the operation? A. That\u2019s right. Q. So, in your professional judgment, and after examining the body and the wound carefully, was it necessary to perform the operation in an attempt to save this young man\u2019s life? A. I believe so. Q. In your judgment? A. Yes, sir.\u201d\nThe charge of the trial judge with regard to the cause of death was full and no criticism is made with regard thereto. Whether the Commonwealth proved this criminal agency and causal connection was properly left to the jury to determine. The jury was instructed: \u201cMembers of the jury, there was a question presented in this case as to whether or not death came from the wound. There is no doubt that he was stabbed, and there appears to be no doubt that an operation was necessary. Dr. Fry, who was the assistant professor of surgery at Jefferson Hospital, which is admittedly a very good hospital, said that he considered it necessary to attempt to save the young man\u2019s life. He told you of the circumstances, he told you of the cutting, and how far it had gone through \u2014 that it came through the chest wall, lacerated and cut through the diaphragm, and cut entirely through the spleen \u2014 and that he thought it advisable to perform an operation in an attempt to save his life. ... So that in this case, so far as the connection of the wound and the death is concerned, you have a young man of 19, there is no evidence at all of any physical ill-being prior to his death, you have the cutting and operation, and thirty-six hours later you have his death. I think, in good human experience, you would have a right to say,\u2014 that if not for the cutting there wouldn\u2019t be any need for an operation, and therefore there would be no death. There is no assertion here that there was negligence in the performance of the operation. ... So in this case, members of the jury, while I leave it entirely to you to find the connection between the wound and the death, I say to you \u2014 and I think it is a fair comment, but you can entirely disregard it \u2014 that you can well find beyond a reasonable doubt that the death and the wound were connected, and so far as I am concerned, that would be the least consideration in the case. The important considerations are the other circumstances. However, it is entirely up to you, and you can disregard my comment.\u201d\nThere was no error in this charge and the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding.\nNo case has been cited by counsel nor has our research discovered any which holds that a coroner\u2019s autopsy is a necessary prerequisite to a conviction for felonious homicide. That it is advisable must be conceded; that it is a necessity has never been so determined. The learned trial judge in his charge to the jury said: \u201cIt is true that there should have been a postmortem here. . . .\u201d People v. Miller, 257 N. Y. 54, 61, 177 N. E. 306, cited by appellant, does not support his contentions. In that case Chief Judge Cardozo said: \u201cThere is indeed a presumption in the absence of inculpatory evidence that death was not caused by the criminal act of the defendant, for this is merely a restatement in another form of the presumption of innocence.\u201d The inculpatory evidence in the instant case, fully set forth, supra, has convinced the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the criminal act of appellant was the cause of Connor\u2019s death. That finding will not be set aside.\nAppellant cites Allegheny County v. Shaw, 34 Pa. 301; Northampton County v. Innes, 26 Pa. 156; Allegheny County v. Watts, 3 Pa. 462; and Commonwealth v. Harman, 4 Pa. 269, as controlling authority for the requirement of a coroner\u2019s autopsy. These cases do not so hold. Nor do Hirko v. Reese, 351 Pa. 238, 40 A. 2d 408, and Marvin v. Monroe County, 154 Pa. Superior Ct. 75, 35 A. 2d 781 so hold. The Act of 1935, P. L. 710, Section 2, 16 PS Section 3161, while placing upon a coroner the duty to investigate all cases where death is sudden or violent or of a suspicious nature and character, does not purport to affect rules of evidence in criminal proceedings. Assuming a coroner to be lax in performance of his duties, that laxity in no way affects the burden of proof or quantum of evidence required in trials for felonious homicide.\nJudgment affirmed."}
