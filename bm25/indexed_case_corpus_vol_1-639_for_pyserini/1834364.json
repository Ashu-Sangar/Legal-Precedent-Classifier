{"id": "1834364", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nWe granted the Appellant\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal to determine whether he was properly extradited under the Extradition Act, Act of July 9, 1976, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9121. Because Appellant failed to request a Stay of Extradition, on February 4, 1991, he was extradited to the state of Maryland. Accordingly, we must grant the Commonwealth\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. See Commonwealth v. Caffrey, 352 Pa.Super. 406, 508 A.2d 322 (1986).\nAppeal dismissed."}
