{"id": "1757583", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from a decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division. The decree ordered the payment of a family exemption pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121 to Marjorie A. Viera, the mother of the decedent Gary W. Otteni. The facts as found by the orphans\u2019 court support the granting of the exemption and, accordingly, the decree is affirmed.\nDecedent\u2019s executrix, his surviving spouse, stipulated that she had forfeited her right to the exemption and that there were no children of the marriage. The only issue concerning the mother\u2019s entitlement to the exemption, therefore, was whether decedent and his mother were members of the same household at the time of decedent\u2019s death.\nThe orphans\u2019 court judge heard extensive testimony on this question and originally refused to grant the exemption. Written exceptions were filed and the same judge, upon reconsideration, sustained the exceptions. Competent evidence showed that during the last months of his life the decedent had his own room in his mother\u2019s house, took most of his meals there and slept there most nights. The judge found that during this period the decedent \u201cspent the vast majority of his time with his mother and her husband in a family relationship,\u201d and concluded that they \u201cwere members of the same household at the time of the decedent\u2019s death . . ..\u201d Because the orphans\u2019 court judge\u2019s findings are supported by adequate and competent evidence they are controlling on our review. McCrea Estate, 475 Pa. 383, 386-87, 380 A.2d 773, 775 (1977).\nThese findings easily fit within our definition of \u201chousehold\u201d for purposes of the family exemption: \u201ca family residing together in. one dwelling using common living quarters and facilities under such domestic arrangements and circumstances, as create a single family unit or establishment.\u201d Shank Estate, 399 Pa. 656, 658, 161 A.2d 47, 48 (1960), quoting Niedzielski Estate, 4 Pa.D. & C.2d 290, 292 (1955) (Erie Co. Orph.Ct.). The orphans\u2019 court properly granted the exemption to decedent\u2019s mother.\nThe decree of the orphans\u2019 court is affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\n20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3121 provides in relevant part:\n\u201cThe spouse of any decedent dying domiciled in the Commonwealth, and if there be no spouse, or if he has forfeited his rights, then such children as are members of the same household as the decedent, and in the event there are no such children, then the parent or parents of the decedent who are members of the same household as the decedent, may retain or claim as an exemption either real or personal property, or both, not theretofore sold by the personal representative, to the value of $2,000 . ..\u201d"}
