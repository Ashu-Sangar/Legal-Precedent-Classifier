{"id": "1742227", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nIn this appeal, we affirm the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County directing testator Harry Fleishman\u2019s residuary estate to pay additional inheritance tax owed the Commonwealth.\nHarry Fleishman died testate in 1955. In Article THIRTEENTH of his will, Testator established a marital trust for the benefit of his wife Mildred:\n\u201cTHIRTEENTH: If my wife, MILDRED S. FLEISHMAN, survives me or is presumed to have survived me, as hereinafter provided, I give, devise and bequeath to MELLON NATIONAL BANK AND TRUST COMPANY [(Mellon Bank)], IN TRUST, an amount equal to one-third (Vs) the value of my adjusted gross estate as finally determined for Federal estate tax purposes. This amount, undiminished and unaffected by any estate, inheritance, transfer, or succession taxes, shall be paid by my executors to the said Trustee, either in cash or in kind, or partly in cash and partly in kind, at the values finally determined for Federal estate tax purposes, to be held upon the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.\u201d\nTestator directed Mellon Bank to pay Mildred income quarterly for life and authorized it, in its discretion, to invade principal to provide adequately for her. Testator further directed Mellon Bank to pay over principal upon Mildred\u2019s death to whomever Mildred in her will appointed.\nIn Article FIFTH, Testator bequeathed various items of personal property to Mildred. In other articles, testator bequeathed personal property and sums of cash, both outright and in trust, to named relatives. Article FIFTEENTH disposed of the residue of testator\u2019s estate.\nIn 1956, the Commonwealth imposed an inheritance tax of $11,000 on the value of testator\u2019s bequests and reserved the right to assess additional tax if persons other than testator\u2019s \u201clineal heirs\u201d received remainder interests in the bequests. Testator\u2019s executors paid the inheritance tax from his residuary estate.\nTestator\u2019s wife, Mildred, died testate in 1974. In her will, Mildred appointed the corpus of the marital trust to appellee Betty Cornell (her daughter by previous marriage) and grandchildren (also by previous marriage). The Commonwealth filed a second inheritance tax claim to collect the additional tax of $10,000 owed because of Mildred\u2019s appointment to heirs \u201ccollateral\u201d to testator.\nArticle FOURTEENTH of testator Harry Fleishman\u2019s will provided:\n\u201cFOURTEENTH: I direct my Executors, hereinafter named, to pay out of the principal of my residuary estate, passing under Article Fifteenth hereof, all estate, inheritance, transfer and succession taxes, imposed upon or payable with respect to any property or interest in property which may be included as part of my estate for the purposes of said taxes, at such time and in such manner as my Executors in their sole discretion shall determine, and no part thereof shall be collected from or pro-rated among any persons receiving or in possession of, or receiving the benefit of, the property or interest in property taxed; it being my particular intention that the bequest to my wife under Article Fifth hereof and the bequest and devise for the benefit of my wife under Article Thirteenth hereof shall be free of all such taxes. In the absolute discretion of my Executors, such taxes may be paid immediately, or the payment of taxes on future or remainder interests under the residuary clause hereof may be postponed until the time possession thereof accrues to the beneficiaries, in which event such taxes shall be paid out of the principal of the trust subject thereto.\u201d\nUpon Mellon Bank\u2019s Petition For Distribution of testator\u2019s marital trust, the orphans\u2019 court concluded that this tax clause manifests testator\u2019s intent that his residuary estate, not Mildred\u2019s, pay the additional tax. The orphans\u2019 court decreed accordingly and appellants Harry Fleishman, Jr., Foster Goldman, and Foster Goldman, Jr., beneficiaries of testator\u2019s residuary trusts, appeal.\nAppellants argue that Article FOURTEENTH of testator Harry Fleishman\u2019s will, directing his executors to pay \u201call . inheritance . . . taxes\u201d out of his residuary estate and stating his \u201cparticular intention\u201d that the \u201cbequest and devise for the benefit of [his] wife . . . shall be free of all such taxes,\u201d is not sufficiently explicit to justify the conclusion that testator intended his residuary estate to bear the burden of additional inheritance tax owed in the event Mildred appointed to collateral heirs. They contend that, had testator wished his children and grandchildren, residuary legatees, to pay taxes on property Mildred appointed to persons unrelated to testator, he would have expressly so provided. Accordingly, relying upon the \u201csource of payment\u201d section of the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, \u00a7 718(c), 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-718(c), which places the \u201cultimate liability for inheritance tax . upon each transferee\u201d where no contrary intent appears in \u201cthe will or other instrument of transfer,\u201d appellants argue that the residuary estate should be relieved of tax liability.\nWhile the law presumes that testators most likely want transferees of bequests to bear attendant inheritance tax burdens, testators are free to allocate the burdens otherwise. E. g., Lander Estate, 416 Pa. 605, 207 A.2d 753 (1965); Horn Estate, 351 Pa. 131, 40 A.2d 471 (1945); accord, Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, \u00a7 718, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-718 (authorizing testators dying on or after January 1, 1962, to allocate tax burdens in manner other than that prescribed by statutory presumptions); Kleinhans Estate, 454 Pa. 539, 312 A.2d 366 (1973) (interpreting \u00a7 718(c) of Act); Zellefrow Estate, 450 Pa. 302, 299 A.2d 248 (1973) (interpreting \u00a7 718(a) of Act); cf. Neamand Estate, 456 Pa. 22, 318 A.2d 730 (1974) (same rule for apportionment of estate taxes); see generally II Casner, Estate Planning Ch. XIX Part 4 (3d ed. 1961). A testator\u2019s intent to allocate inheritance tax in a particular fashion \u201cmust be unambiguous and open to no other interpretation.\u201d Noteboom Estate, 473 Pa. 32, 38, 373 A.2d 737, 739 (1977) (interpreting tax clause in inter vivos deed of trust), quoting Erieg Estate, 439 Pa. 550, 556, 267 A.2d 841, 845 (1970); accord, e. g., Lander Estate, supra (citing cases).\nArticle FOURTEENTH of testator\u2019s will unambiguously demonstrates testator intended his residuary estate to bear the burden of all inheritance tax owed the Commonwealth, including the additional taxes at issue here. Testator directed that the residuary estate bear the burden of \u201call\u201d taxes \u201cimposed upon\u201d \u201cany property or interest in property which may be included as part of [his] estate\u201d for purposes of taxation, which included the property Mildred\u2019s appointment transferred. See supra note 4. Any doubt that \u201cany property\u201d included property transferred through Mildred\u2019s exercise is resolved when it is considered that testator authorized his executors to pay the taxes \u201cat such time and in such manner as [they] in their sole discretion shall determine.\u201d Thus, testator contemplated that certain transfer taxes would be payable both at and after death. Under applicable inheritance tax laws, these transfer taxes included those on property transferred through powers of appointment. Act of June 20, 1919, P.S. 521, \u00a7 3, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2304 (1964); Carver Estate, 422 Pa. 609, 222 A.2d 882 (1966).\nMoreover, testator\u2019s tax clause contains two express provisions, exonerating from taxation transferred property subject to transfer tax. First, testator directed that \u201cno part [of the tax payments] shall be collected from or pro-rated among any persons receiving or in possession of, or receiving the benefit of the property or interest in property taxed.\u201d Further, with unmistakeable clarity, testator stated his \u201cparticular intention that the bequest to [his] wife under Article Fifth hereof [(bequeathing Mildred personal property)] and the bequest and devise for the benefit of [Mildred] under Article Thirteenth hereof [(creating the marital trust and power of appointment)] shall be free of all such taxes.\u201d Testator\u2019s wish that \u201cany persons receiving the benefit of property\u201d subject to tax should not bear the tax burden surely encompassed Mildred\u2019s appointees, for they gained through the appointment. Also, knowing Mildred would benefit from not only her lifetime interest in the trust but also the general power of appointment, testator used the terms \u201cfor the benefit of my wife,\u201d language unambiguously broad enough to relieve the entire transfer to Mildred of the burden of inheritance tax.\nThat the burden of additional inheritance tax falls upon testator\u2019s relatives, while \u201ccollateral heirs\u201d enjoy the transferred property free of tax, does not alter testator\u2019s express intention that his residuary estate bear the tax burden. In clear, absolute, and definite terms, testator directed the source of payment of \u201call taxes\u201d on \u201cany property\u201d \u201cwhich may be included as part of [his] estate\u201d and \u201cno part thereof shall be collected from or pro-rated among any persons receiving or in possession of, or receiving the benefit of, the property or interest in property taxed.\u201d His intent must prevail.\nAppellants next contend that, notwithstanding any of the language in the tax clause of Harry Fleishman\u2019s will, his wife, in the tax clause of her will, assumed responsibility for inheritance taxes payable because of her appointment to heirs \u201ccollateral\u201d to testator. Appellants have not cited, nor can we find, any decision of this Court authorizing the donee of a power of appointment to alter a donor-testator\u2019s express direction that his residuary estate pay \u201call taxes.\u201d Though the donee exercises a power and appointees benefit by its exercise, the donor\u2019s estate is the subject of tax, see supra note 4, and therefore it is the donor\u2019s intent which controls. See text supra; Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, \u00a7 718, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-718 (inquiry in determining where burden of inheritance tax falls first focuses on \u201cwill\u201d or \u201cother instrument of transfer\u201d). Indeed, to accept appellants\u2019 contrary contention is to ignore testator\u2019s careful testamentary plan.\nDecree affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(3), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(3) (Supp.1978).\n. Testator divided the residue of his estate in half, creating two trusts. Appellants Harry Fleishman, Jr., Foster Goldman, and Foster Goldman, Jr. are beneficiaries of these residuary trusts.\n. The Act of June 20, 1919, P.L. 521, \u00a7 2, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2302 (1964), authorizes the Commonwealth to impose two rates of inheritance tax upon decedents\u2019 bequests. The Act empowers the Commonwealth to collect tax at a rate of two per cent on bequests to, or for the benefit of, certain of decedents\u2019 relatives, often referred to as \u201clineal heirs,\u201d and a tax of fifteen per cent on bequests to persons outside this class, commonly known as \u201ccollateral heirs.\u201d The Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, Act of June 15, 1961, P.L. 373, \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq., 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2485-101 et seq. (1964), which applies where decedents die on or after January 1, 1962, id., \u00a7 103, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-103, see infra note 8, preserves this distinction. Id., \u00a7\u00a7 403 & 404, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2485-403 & 2485-404. Effective December 29, 1967, the Commonwealth is authorized to collect a six per cent rate of tax on bequests to, or for the use of, lineal heirs. Act of December 29, 1967, P.L. 915, \u00a7 1, amending Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, \u00a7 403, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-403 (Supp.1978).\n. The Amendatory Act of 1929, Act of May 16, 1929, P.L. 1795, \u00a7 1, amending Act of June 20, 1919, \u00a7 1, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2301(d) (1964), provides that property transferred through exercise of a power of appointment is to \u201cbe taxed as of the estate of the donor, notwithstanding any blending of such property with the property of the donee.\u201d Thus, in determining the applicable rate of inheritance tax on property so transferred, see supra note 3, an appointee\u2019s relation to the donor, rather than donee, is controlling. E. g., Powell Estate, 417 Pa. 164, 207 A.2d 857 (1965). Sections 309 and 408 of the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2485-309 & 2485-408, adopt this rule. See generally Grossman & Smith, Pennsylvania Inheritance & Estate Tax \u00a7\u00a7 309-2 & 309-3 (rev. ed. 1971). No dispute exists concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s determination that Mildred appointed to \u201ccollateral heirs.\u201d\n. See supra note 2.\n. Relying upon Section 741 of the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-741, which provides that fiduciaries are primarily responsible for payment of transfer taxes on property of which they are in charge, appellants argue that Mellon Bank, in its Petition For Distribution, lacked standing to raise the issue of who should pay additional inheritance tax. Appellants contend that, under Kleinhans Estate, 454 Pa. 539, 312 A.2d 366 (1973), the Commonwealth is entitled to collect inheritance tax from the assets of the marital trust and therefore Mellon Bank\u2019s sole responsibility in this matter is to pay the tax. According to appellants, only-after Mellon Bank fulfills its duty to pay inheritance tax may it seek reimbursement from those it believes are obligated to pay.\nIn Kleinhans, the testator established two residuary trusts funded equally, one for the benefit of his wife for life, principal to pass as his wife in her will appointed, the other for the benefit of his sister for life, remainder to the testator\u2019s grandsons. The testator\u2019s sister predeceased testator and thus the executors distributed outright the principal of the second trust to the testator\u2019s grandsons. The testator\u2019s wife appointed the principal of the trust in favor of heirs collateral to testator. Accordingly, the Commonwealth sought inheritance tax, at a rate of fifteen per cent, on the property transferred through the wife\u2019s appointment. Over the argument of the wife\u2019s estate that the testator\u2019s will directed all taxes to be paid from his residuary estate and thus testator\u2019s grandsons, residuary benefici\u00e1ries, should share the burden of taxation, and the contention that Section 718(c) of the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-718(c), limited the Commonwealth\u2019s right to collect the full inheritance tax from a single trust, this Court concluded that the trustee of the residuary trust was obliged to pay the full sum of inheritance tax from the marital trust. We stated: \u201cIf [the wife\u2019s estate\u2019s] interpretation of section 718(c) were to prevail, the Commonwealth would have to collect the other half of the tax from the remainder beneficiaries of [the second trust], who received their legacy prior to the termination of the widow\u2019s life tenancy. We conclude that Section 718(c) does not justify such an unsound result.\u201d 454 Pa. at 543, 312 A.2d at 369.\nWe find Kleinhans inapposite. No' dispute exists here concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s right to collect all the additional inheritance tax owed. Rather, Mellon Bank requested the orphans\u2019 court to direct a proper distribution. This distribution could be made only if Mellon Bank knew whether, and to what extent, Mildred\u2019s estate bore responsibility for taxes owed because of Mildred\u2019s appointment. Rather than distribute the assets of her estate and then attempt, in subsequent proceedings, to recover a share from beneficiaries under her will, Mellon Bank first sought to dispose of the important question of tax burden. The orphans\u2019 court has authority to resolve this question before distribution. 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 762 (1975) (authorizing orphans\u2019 courts to decide or dispose of \u201cany question relating to the administration or distribution of an estate or trust and exercise any of its powers in respect thereof upon the filing of an account or in any other appropriate proceeding\u201d). If we were to hold Mellon Bank acted improperly, we would discourage the prompt and orderly administration of estates, leaving all parties uncertain of their rights and obligations concerning transfer taxes.\n. Act of June 15, 1961, P.L. 373.\n. Appellants err in assuming the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961 applies. Section 103 of the Act, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-103, fixes January 1, 1962, as the effective date of the Act, repealing or displacing existing law only insofar as it would have applied to cases where decedents died on or after that date. Because testator died in 1955, law existing before the effective date of the Act controls.\n. Erieg Estate, 439 Pa. 550, 267 A.2d 841 (1970), upon which appellants rely, is not to the contrary. There, testator directed that all taxes payable because of his death \u201cshall be paid from [his] residuary estate.\u201d We found the testator\u2019s tax clause insufficient proof of his intent to disturb the relevant statutory presumption that testators wish estate taxes to be pro-rated among legatees. Here, however, testator\u2019s intent to alter the relevant presumption of tax burden is manifested with unquestioned clarity.\nAppellants also argue that the orphans\u2019 court erred in relying upon Section 408 of the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-408, which provides that \u201c[property subject to a power of appointment . . . shall be taxed only as part of the estate of the donor,\u201d as dispositive of the source of inheritance tax payment. Appellants correctly state that this provision and Section 309 of the Act, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-309, establish the taxable event, rather than source of payment. We do not, however, read the opinion of the orphans\u2019 court to rest its decree upon Section 408. The orphans\u2019 court relied upon the express language of testator\u2019s will in reaching its correct result.\n. Appellants further argue that the orphans\u2019 court erroneously ruled inadmissible testimony of the scrivener of Mildred\u2019s tax clause. Because we conclude Mildred\u2019s tax clause cannot alter her husband\u2019s express testamentary intent, we do not review this ruling of the orphans\u2019 court."}
