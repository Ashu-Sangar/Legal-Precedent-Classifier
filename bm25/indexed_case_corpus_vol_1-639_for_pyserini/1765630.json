{"id": "1765630", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nKAUFFMAN, Justice.\nOn October 4, 1976, after a non jury trial, appellant, Robert Carol Taylor, was convicted of burglary and murder of the second degree. No post-verdict motions were filed, and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. No direct appeal was taken. In April 1977, appellant filed a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA). After a counseled evidentiary hearing, appellant\u2019s request for relief was denied. This appeal followed.\nAppellant advances but a single claim-that his trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to file a motion to suppress an allegedly involuntary confession. The PCHA court found this claim to be without merit. We agree.\nIt is well established that \u201ccounsel\u2019s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interest.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 604, 235 A.2d 349, 352 (1967) (emphasis in original). Counsel will not be found ineffective unless the course \u201cnot chosen offered a potential for success substantially greater than the tactics actually utilized.\u201d Id., 427 Pa. at 605, 235 A.2d at 353. Thus, \u201c \u2018counsel cannot be found ineffective for failing to assert a meritless claim\u2019.\u201d Commonwealth v. Johnson, 490 Pa. 312, 416 A.2d 485 (1980); Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687 (1977).\nAfter hearing testimony from appellant, trial counsel, and two police officers, the PCHA court rejected appellant\u2019s version of the facts and concluded that his confession was given voluntarily. The record contains competent evidence to support such a conclusion, and we will not disturb it on appeal. See Commonwealth v. Minnick, 432 Pa. 462, 464, 247 A.2d 569, 571 (1968). Thus, counsel was not ineffective for failing to assert an unsupported claim.\nOrder of the PCHA court affirmed.\nLARSEN, J., concurs in the result.\n. Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, \u00a7 1 et seq., 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-1 et seq. (Pamph. 1979-80).\n. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2 as amended, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722(1) (Pamph. 1979).\n. Appellant\u2019s claim is based primarily on his own testimony, most of which the PCHA court found unworthy of belief. At the hearing, appellant stated that he confessed because the police (1) promised to drop charges against his girlfriend, (2) promised he would receive a sentence of only ten to twenty years, and (3) threatened him with the death penalty if he refused to cooperate or consulted his attorney. Significantly, appellant admits that he never told his counsel about the alleged promise of a lenient sentence and the alleged threat of the death penalty. These allegations were made for the first time at the PCHA hearing."}
