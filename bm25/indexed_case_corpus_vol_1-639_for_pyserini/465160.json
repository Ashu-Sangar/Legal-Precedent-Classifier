{"id": "465160", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Chief Justice.\nFollowing a bench trial, Appellee, Kevin Roberts, was convicted of robbery, criminal conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime. The trial court denied Appellee\u2019s post-verdict motion to modify his sentence and sentenced Appellee to consecutive terms of two (2) to five (5) years\u2019 imprisonment for robbery and possession of an instrument of crime and ten (10) years\u2019 probation for criminal conspiracy.\nOn appeal to the Superior Court, Appellee argued that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress the victim\u2019s identification of him as the fruit of an illegal arrest. Appellee claimed that the arrest was illegal because the arresting officer, a state university campus police officer, lacked jurisdiction to lawfully arrest Appellee outside the physical boundaries of the university property. The Superior Court vacated the judgment of sentence, holding that there was arguable merit to Appellee\u2019s underlying claim and that his trial counsel should have filed a motion to suppress the victim\u2019s identification of Appellee since university campus police lack jurisdiction to arrest a person off university property. Commonwealth v. Roberts, 428 Pa.Super. 156, 630 A.2d 869 (1993). The Superior Court remanded the matter for an evidentiary hearing to establish whether the robbery and arrest took place on university property. Id.\nWe granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal to resolve the issue of whether an evidentiary hearing is needed to determine whether Appellee\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to suppress the victim\u2019s identification of Appellee on the basis that the state university campus police officer\u2019s arrest of Appellee outside the boundaries of the university property may have been unlawful. Because we find that the identification of Appellee by his victim was not the direct result of Appellee\u2019s arrest, regardless of its legality, we reverse the Superior Court\u2019s remand of this matter and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment of sentence.\nA summary of the evidence establishes that on October 30, 1991, at approximately 1:30 a.m., Appellee and a co-defendant robbed Sean Robertson, a University of Pittsburgh student, at knife point as he walked from campus to his apartment. The victim testified that as he was walking home, Appellee darted in front of him, pulled out a ten to twelve-inch blade kitchen knife from his pants and demanded the victim\u2019s money. After the victim responded that he had no money, Appellee\u2019s co-defendant checked the victim\u2019s jacket and pants\u2019 pockets, and took from the victim a pack of Viceroy cigarettes, keys and the victim\u2019s student identification. The co-defendant returned the victim\u2019s keys before fleeing but kept the victim\u2019s cigarettes and student identification. The victim further testified that the robbery occurred in a well-lit area and that the encounter lasted several minutes.\nUniversity of Pittsburgh Campus Police Officer Curtis Smith, testified that during the course of the robbery, he was on his routine patrol and passed three individuals on the street in a well-lit area near the university law school. Officer Smith testified that the three looked suspicious because of the close manner in which they stood to one another. As he slowed his vehicle to get a closer look, he observed that the victim looked distressed. Consequently, Officer Smith drove approximately twenty-five to fifty yards down the street and then turned around to come back toward the three men. As he approached, Appellee and the co-defendant ran towards Forbes Avenue. The victim informed Officer Smith that the two males had just robbed him at knife point. The victim described Appellee as fair complected with light eyes and wearing a red shirt and blue jeans. The victim described the co-defendant as darker skinned with a mustache, wearing a white shirt and blue jeans. The victim further informed Officer Smith that Appellee and his co-defendant took his student identification and a pack of Viceroy cigarettes.\nAs Officer Smith drove around the block searching for the robbers, he observed Appellee and his cohort crossing a university parking lot. Officer Smith then pulled Ms squad car in front of Appellee and the co-defendant and questioned them regarding their encounter with the victim. After searching them, he found the victim\u2019s Viceroy cigarettes and the victim\u2019s student identification in the co-defendant\u2019s possession. Officer Smith found the knife in the campus parking lot approximately forty yards away from where he stopped Appellee and his co-defendant. After arresting Appellee and his co-conspirator, Officer Smith transported them to the campus police station. The victim identified both Appellee and the co-defendant as the perpetrators at the Pittsburgh Campus Police station approximately fifteen minutes after his attack. The victim also made a positive in-court identification of Appellee as his attacker.\nAt trial, Appellee testified that the co-defendant was the person who took the cigarettes and identification from the victim\u2019s pockets. Appellee, in contrast, claimed he did not threaten the victim in any way, but he did admit owning the knife which was found in the parking lot. He further admitted that he had the kmfe tucked into his pants when he was speaking with the victim, and that he intentionally dropped it to the ground upon seeing Officer Smith and Ms campus security vehicle.\nThe law is well-settled in Pennsylvania that trial counsel is presumed to have been effective. Commonwealth v. Miller, 494 Pa. 229, 431 A.2d 233 (1981). In order to defeat this presumption and prove a claim of ineffectiveness, a claimant must demonstrate that: (1) the underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) the particular course of conduct chosen by trial counsel did not have some reasonable basis designed to effectuate the claimant\u2019s interests; and (3) counsel\u2019s alleged ineffectiveness prejudiced the claimant. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987). Counsel can never be deemed ineffective for failing to raise a meritless claim. Commonwealth v. Pettus, 492 Pa. 558, 424 A.2d 1332 (1981).\nAppellee contends that counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress the victim\u2019s identification of him as the fruit of an illegal arrest. With respect to the merit of the underlying claim, we find that the victim\u2019s identification of Appellee is legally admissible because it was not the direct result of Appellee\u2019s arrest. In Commonwealth v. Garvin, 448 Pa. 258, 293 A.2d 33 (1972), this Court was confronted with the issue of whether the appellant\u2019s arrest was illegal and, if so, whether the subsequent identification was tainted by the illegality. Although it was determined that the appellant\u2019s arrest was illegal, this Court nevertheless upheld the admissibility of an in-court identification as well as an out-of-court identification that occurred immediately after the appellant was arrested. In so holding, we observed that \u201c[n]o law abiding society could tolerate a presumption that but for the illegal arrest the suspect would never have been required to face his accusors [sic]. Thus, ... the only effect of the illegal arrest was to hasten the inevitable confrontation and not to influence its outcome.\u201d Id. at 264, 293 A.2d at 37.\nAssuming arguendo that Officer Smith\u2019s arrest of Appellee was illegal in the instant case, the identification evidence is nonetheless admissible. The record reveals that an adequate and independent basis existed to support the victim\u2019s identification of Appellee. The victim testified that the lighting conditions were good at the time that he was approached by Appellee and the co-defendant. (R.R. at 25a). He also had the opportunity to view the two men for a period of three to five minutes at a distance of only several feet. (R.R. at 26a-27a).\nBased on the foregoing, it is apparent that the illegality of the arrest, if any, did not contribute to the knowledge of the witness nor to the accuracy of his identification. As such, we must conclude that counsel was not ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress the identification of Appellee.\nAccordingly, the Order of the Superior Court vacating the judgment of sentence and remanding the matter for an evidentiary hearing is reversed. The trial court\u2019s judgment of sentence is reinstated.\nCASTILLE, J., files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nNIGRO, J., dissents.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 907.\n. The victim testified that he did not attempt to get the officer's attention because Appellee threatened to cut him if he moved.\n. Police subsequently transported Appellee and the co-defendant to the City of Pittsburgh Police station, as they were required to do, after processing the complaint at the campus station."}
