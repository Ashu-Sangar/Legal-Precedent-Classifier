We hold that this procedure failed to comply with our mandate in Silverberg.\nThe order of the special disciplinary court is vacated and the matter is remanded to that court for a new disciplinary hearing in compliance with our prior order.\nPOMEROY filed a dissenting opinion in which JONES, C. J., and NIX, J., join."}
