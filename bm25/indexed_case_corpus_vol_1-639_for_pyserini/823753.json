{"id": "823753", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nWe do not think it was error to deny the defendant\u2019s second point, which asked the court to instruct the jury \u201c that, if the jury believe that the alleged defect was a patent defect, apparent upon careless inspection, then the same is not covered by a general warranty.\u201d The jury have found the fact of a warranty, and the breach. Said breach related to a defect in the eye, known among horsemen as \u201c blue-eye.\u201d Our attention has not been called to a word of testimony showing that this was \u201ca patent defect, apparent upon careless inspection.\u201d We are not called upon to consider the law as stated in the point, for the reason that it is of no importance, unless based upon the testimony in the case.\nJudgment affirmed."}
