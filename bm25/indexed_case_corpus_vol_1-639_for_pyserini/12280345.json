The issue, as stated by petitioner, is:\nWhether, under Pennsylvania law, a search warrant should be invalidated and the resulting evidence suppressed where an affiant truthfully and accurately recites statements made by a self-incriminating co-defendant in an affidavit of probable cause, but the falsity of the co-defendant\u2019s statements could not be discovered prior to the issuance of the search warrant?\nJustice WECHT did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter."}
