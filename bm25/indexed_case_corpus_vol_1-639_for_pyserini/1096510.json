{"id": "1096510", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nPlaintiff was seriously injured through negligence of defendant; he recovered a verdict for $5,000, on which, after its reduction to $4,000, the court below entered judgment. Defendant has appealed and contends only that the verdict is so excessive that we should reverse the court below for not granting a new trial. After reading the evidence on the question involved, we are not convinced of reversible error.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
