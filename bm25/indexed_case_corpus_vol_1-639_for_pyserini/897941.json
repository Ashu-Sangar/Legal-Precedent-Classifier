{"id": "897941", "contents": "Peb Ctjbiam,\nWe find no error in this record that requires either a reversal or modification of the decree from which this appeal was taken. So far as they are material to appellant\u2019s contention, the learned judge\u2019s findings of fact are sustained by the evidence, and his conclusions based on the controlling facts thus established are substantially correct. Extended discussion of the questions involved would serve no useful purpose.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
