{"id": "4184537", "contents": "OPINION AND OPINION IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL ON DOCKET No. 651 CAP\nPER CURIAM.\nThe Court is unanimous in the view that the appeal at Docket No. 650 CAP should be affirmed, but is evenly divided on the appeal at Docket No. 651 CAP; therefore, the grant of penalty phase relief, at issue in No. 651 CAP, is affirmed by operation of law. This per curiam Opinion, in Part II, represents the Opinion of the Court as to the appeal at docket No. 650 CAP, which is Michael Bardo\u2019s appeal from the order of the PCRA court denying him guilt phase relief and also denying several of his penalty phase claims. In Part I, however, this Opinion expresses only the views of Mr. Chief Justice Castille and Messrs. Justice Eakin and Stevens as to docket No. 651 CAP, which is the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal from the grant of penalty phase relief.\nBackground\nIn September 1992, Bardo was arrested for the death and indecent assault of his three-year-old niece. Evidence presented at trial in January 1993 included Bardo\u2019s statement to police that he had digitally penetrated the child\u2019s vagina, accidently killed her by putting his hand over her mouth to quiet her, placed her body in a trash bag, and threw it from a bridge into a creek. The defense strategy at trial was to acknowledge that Bardo was criminally responsible for the child\u2019s death, but to try to establish that the killing was not intentional. The Commonwealth\u2019s forensic pathology expert testified that the child\u2019s death was due to asphyxia resulting from a deliberate, forceful compression of her neck lasting four to five minutes, with the pressure continuing even after she lost consciousness. Commonwealth v. Bardo, 551 Pa. 140, 709 A.2d 871, 877 (1998). The jury found Bardo guilty of first-degree murder and aggravated indecent assault. Following the penalty phase of trial, the jury found two aggravating circumstances: killing in the perpetration of a felony and killing of a person under the age of twelve. One or more jurors also found the following mitigating factors: Bardo\u2019s mother\u2019s testimony, his school records and background, his acceptance of responsibility/remorse, his willingness to plead, and his alcohol abuse. See Sentencing Verdict Slip, dated 1/28/93, at 4; Notes of Testimony (\u201cN.T.\u201d) Trial, 1/28/93, at 844-55 (polling the jury). Finding unanimously that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, the jury determined that Bardo should be sentenced to death. The trial court accordingly imposed the death sentence, and, on February 27, 1998, this Court affirmed the judgment of sentence on direct appeal. Bardo, 709 A.2d at 879.\nBardo filed a timely PCRA petition, and on December 6, 2007, the PCRA court appointed new counsel, who filed an amended PCRA petition on June 18, 2008. Following a four-day hearing in November 2009, the PCRA court granted Bardo a new penalty phase hearing based on the court\u2019s finding of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to the presentation of evidence of mitigating factors; the PCRA court denied all of Bardo\u2019s other claims.\nIn order to obtain collateral relief pursuant to the PCRA, a petitioner must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that his or her conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the circumstances enumerated in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2). Commonwealth v. Spotz, 610 Pa. 17, 18 A.3d 244, 259 (2011). These circumstances include a violation of the Pennsylvania or United States Constitution or ineffectiveness of counsel, any one of which \u201cso undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2)(i) and (ii). In addition, a petitioner must show that the claims of error have not been previously litigated or waived. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(3). An issue has been previously litigated if \u201cthe highest appellate court in which the petitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(a)(2). An issue has been waived \u201cif the' petitioner could have raised it but failed to do so before trial, at trial, on appeal or in a prior state post[-]conviction proceeding.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b).\nAll of the issues before this Court involve allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel. Counsel is presumed effective, and the petitioner bears the burden of proving otherwise. Commonwealth v. Roney, 622 Pa. 1, 79 A.3d 595, 604 (2013). To prevail on an ineffectiveness claim, the petitioner must plead and prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the Sixth Amendment performance and prejudice standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). This Court has divided the performance component of Strickland into two sub-parts dealing with arguable merit and reasonable strategy. Commonwealth v. Baumhammers, 625 Pa. 354, 92 A.3d 708, 719 (2014). Thus, to prevail on an ineffectiveness claim, the petitioner must show: that the underlying legal claim has arguable merit; that counsel had no reasonable basis for his or her action or omission; and that the petitioner suffered prejudice as a result. Id. (citing Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973, 975-76 (1987)).\nWith regard to \u201creasonable basis,\u201d the PCRA court \u201cdoes not question whether there were other more logical courses of action which counsel could have pursued; rather, [the court] must examine whether counsel\u2019s decisions had any reasonable basis.\u201d Roney, supra (quoting Commonwealth v. Hanible, 612 Pa. 183, 30 A.3d 426, 439 (2011)). [The PCRA court] will conclude that counsel\u2019s strategy lacked a reasonable basis only if the petitioner proves that a foregone alternative \u201coffered a potential for success substantially greater than the course actually pursued.\u201d Id. (quoting Spotz, 18 A.3d at 260). To establish Strickland prejudice, the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different but for counsel\u2019s action or inaction. Id. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is, for example, a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict returned by the jury. Commonwealth v. Gibson, 597 Pa. 402, 951 A.2d 1110, 1120 (2008) (\u201cGibson I \u201d) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052). When assessing prejudice in the context of a claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness for failing to present additional evidence of mitigation in a death penalty case, the PCRA court must directly compare the mitigation case offered at trial with the credited mitigation evidence offered on post-conviction review. The goal of this comparison is to determine whether it is (or is not) reasonably probable that, had the additional evidence of mitigation been presented at trial, at least one juror would have concluded that the mitigating circumstances outweighed or were as weighty as the aggravating circumstances, and thus would have voted for a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death. Commonwealth v. Beasley, 600 Pa. 458, 967 A.2d 376, 391 (2009); Gibson I, 951 A.2d at 1123.\nOn appellate review, this Court must determine whether the PCRA court\u2019s rulings are supported by the record and are free of legal error. Spotz, 18 A.3d at 259. The ineffectiveness inquiry constitutes a mixed question of law and fact. Commonwealth v. Martin, 607 Pa. 165, 5 A.3d 177, 197 (2010) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 698, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)); see id. at 205 (Castffle, C.J., concurring). If supported by the record, the PCRA court\u2019s credibility determinations and factual findings are binding on this Court; however, we apply a de novo standard of review to the PCRA court\u2019s legal conclusions. Spotz, 18 A.3d at 259; Martin, 5 A.3d at 197.\nWhen making the ultimate prejudice assessment in a claim of counsel ineffectiveness for failing to present additional evidence of mitigation, which is the subject of the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal addressed in Part I below, this Court must reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of the evidence of mitigation, which includes both the evidence presented at the penalty phase hearing and the credited evidence on PCRA review. Commonwealth v. Gibson, 610 Pa. 332, 19 A.3d 512, 526 (2011) (\u201cGibson II \u201d). This Court has acknowledged that such reweighing is not \u201can exact science,\u201d but has also concluded that we may evaluate the relative strength of the aggravating and mitigating circumstances to determine if the new evidence in mitigation would have been reasonably likely to sway a juror to alter his or her conclusion and vote for a sentence of life imprisonment rather than death. Id. at 530-31. When the aggravating circumstances are substantial, it may be particularly difficult to establish prejudice based on additional mitigation evidence proffered upon PCRA review. Id. at 531 (citing Smith v. Spisak, 558 U.S. 139, 130 S.Ct. 676, 175 L.Ed.2d 595 (2010)).\nI. The Commonwealth\u2019s Appeal (651 CAP)\nWe address first the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal, where the sole claim is framed as follows:\nWhether the PCRA Court erred by granting [Bardo] a new sentencing hearing where the court erroneously determined that the alleged additional mitigating evidence had arguable merit, that counsel would have known about the evidence at the time of trial, that counsel did not have a reasonable strategic basis for not presenting the evidence, and that defendant was prejudiced by the omission?\nCommonwealth\u2019s Brief at 4. The PCRA court\u2019s basis for granting Bardo a new penalty phase hearing was its finding that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to present additional evidence of mitigation, particularly expert testimony concerning his mental health history, diagnoses and treatment, and his childhood environment and upbringing. PCRA Court Opinion, filed 1/3/12, at 26-46. Following the directives set forth by this Court in Gibson II, 19 A.3d at 526-27 and Gibson I, 951 A.2d at 1122-23, the PCRA court compared in detail the mitigation evidence presented at trial with the evidence offered at the PCRA hearing, as follows.\nDuring the penalty phase of trial, defense counsel presented seven witnesses: Bardo himself; his mother, Judith Wolfe; a Wilkes-Barre city health inspector; an assistant principal at Bardo\u2019s junior high school, the last school he attended; two of Bardo\u2019s school teachers; and a neighbor of Bardo\u2019s family. Ms. Wolfe testified that Bardo was the sixth of her seven children, and she could not remember the year he was born. Bardo\u2019s father (George Bardo) was an alcoholic who \u201cnever came home\u201d and drank to the point of drunkenness \u201call the time\u201d; had no contact with his son since the time Bardo was a toddler; and tried to commit suicide by cutting his wrists with a razor blade at the family home, an injury that he survived. Ms. Wolfe did not think that Bardo remembered his father, and his stepfather did not participate in Bardo\u2019s activities or act as a father figure to him. Bardo went to several schools and the family moved often. Ms. Wolfe acknowledged that she had her \u201chands full\u201d with her children, and had a hard time controlling her son when he got older. Bardo began drinking at about age thirteen, and at times \u201cfell in the door\u201d to the family home due to his intoxication. Also, as a young teenager, Bardo was sexually abused on a number of occasions by a man who bought beer for him. Ms. Wolfe learned about this sexual abuse from Bardo when he was eighteen years old, although it had occurred years earlier. Ms. Wolfe thought that Bardo married at age sixteen. He had two children, ages six and five, by the time of trial. At one time, according to Ms. Wolfe, Bardo and his wife lived in an empty warehouse. Finally, Ms. Wolfe asked the jury to spare her son\u2019s life. N.T. Penalty Phase, 1/28/93, at 756-73.\nAs testified to by an assistant principal and his teachers, Bardo did not have behavior problems in school, but his academic performance was extremely poor; he failed fifth grade, he failed seventh grade twice, and he dropped out entirely in the ninth grade at age seventeen. His appearance in school was very unkempt. A teacher testified that Bardo \u201chad a very difficult time\u201d in school, and \u201cwas in over his head.\u201d Bardo went to the Children\u2019s Service Center at age fifteen for help functioning in a school setting. The assistant principal testified that Bardo\u2019s \u201cparents were cooperative, but things did not change that much.\u201d However, a teacher testified that Bardo\u2019s parents were uncooperative on the rare occasion when school personnel were successful in contacting them. As another teacher testified, Bardo was already married in the ninth grade, at which point he was \u201crelatively neat and clean\u201d and living with his wife\u2019s family. Id. at 715-49.\nA neighbor testified that, in the year before Bardo\u2019s offenses, loud noise emanated from the Bardo family residence, and family members fought in the streets and exhibited signs of drunkenness. A city health inspector testified that, around the time of the offenses, the Bardo residence contained numerous animals and was infested with fleas; the house required the services of an exterminator, but was habitable. Id. at 703-06, 754-55.\nBardo testified that he was an alcoholic and that he had started drinking alcohol at approximately eleven or twelve years of age, resulting in blackouts after binge drinking, and interference with his schooling. He had moved many times with his mother as a child, did not like school, and did not have a close family. He did not know his father, and his stepfather was not involved in his life. He was repeatedly sexually abused by a man who bought beer for him; he remembered waking up naked in the man\u2019s house after a night of drinking. He went to the Children\u2019s Service Center, where he enrolled in the Adolescent Learning Center program; although he claimed to do well there, he quit one day after a quarrel with his girlfriend (later wife), and he did not return. He lived in an abandoned, rundown warehouse with his wife for a while. He testified that he had low self-esteem and felt inferior, often feeling like he was nothing compared to other people. He further testified to two suicide attempts in 1985. In the first attempt, he and his wife took overdoses of prescription pain pills, and in the second, he cut his wrists. He was hospitalized after both incidents. He knew that his father had also cut his wrists. Finally, Bardo accepted responsibility for the victim\u2019s death, was remorseful, and asked for mercy. Id. at 775-93; see PCRA Court Opinion at 26-28. No mental health professional testified during Bardo\u2019s trial.\nIn contrast, at the PCRA hearing, three mental health experts testified for the defense as to Bardo\u2019s impoverished childhood and miserable home life, and as to his psychiatric history and diagnoses at the time of the offenses. These defense experts were: (1) Neil Blumberg, M.D., a forensic psychiatrist who evaluated Bardo in the spring of 2008 and who opined that, at the time of the 1992 offenses, Bardo was suffering from six mental disorders, some of which involved alcohol abuse; (2) Matthew Berger, M.D., a forensic psychiatrist, who had been retained by trial counsel in 1993 and had twice evaluated Bardo, the first time at the request of trial counsel prior to trial, and the second time at the request of PCRA counsel in 2009, after which he diagnosed Bardo as suffering from several mental disorders, in partial agreement with Dr. Blumberg\u2019s diagnoses; and (3) Ned Delaney, a licensed psychologist, who had also been retained by defense counsel at the time of trial to evaluate Bardo for his history of alcohol abuse and his degree of intoxication at the time of the offenses. In addition, PCRA counsel retained Gary Lage, Ph.D., a pharmacologist and toxicologist, to estimate Bardo\u2019s blood alcohol content, and the likely psychological and physiological effects of his intoxication, at the time of the offenses. Finally, PCRA counsel proffered the testimony of Bardo\u2019s trial counsel, who confirmed that they had retained Dr. Berger and Mr. Delaney prior to trial, but did not call either to testify. The sole Commonwealth witness at the PCRA hearing was John O\u2019Brien, M.D., a forensic psychiatrist who had evaluated Bardo in 2009.\nAfter hearing testimony from the above witnesses; reviewing Bardo\u2019s records, including school, juvenile, agency, and hospital records; and comparing the evidence of mitigation presented at the penalty phase and at the PCRA hearing, the PCRA court concluded: \u201cTrial Counsels\u2019 penalty phase presentation was disjointed, scattered and particularly ineffectual in its failure to synthesize readily available life history evidence of mental illness, family dysfunction and physical and sexual abuse into a coherent and persuasive case in support of mitigation.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion at 37. The PCRA court singled out the \u201cinexplicable]\u201d failure to call Dr. Berger and Mr. Delaney as penalty phase expert witnesses, even though they had informed trial counsel of their possible ability to provide evidence in support of mitigation. Id. In its Pierce!Strickland analysis, the PCRA court concluded as follows with regard to the arguable merit of Bardo\u2019s ineffectiveness claim:\nAt the very least, the evidence presented during the PCRA hearing established there was mental health evidence found in records contained in Trial Counsels\u2019 file and/or in readily available records at the time of trial.... This evidence and associated [multiple mental health] diagnoses would have supported the substantially impaired statutory mitigating fact[or] found at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(3), and the extreme disturbance statutory mitigating factor under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(2). This evidence and/or diagnoses was [sic] not presented at the penalty phase even though Dr. Berger advised Trial Counsel he could assist in the penalty phase, and Mr. Delaney offered a report outlining several diagnoses and/or factual underpinning of the same supporting a mitigating factor.\nId. at 40.\nThe PCRA court further relied on the PCRA hearing testimony of trial counsel to conclude that there was no reasonable basis for the failure to investigate fully the potential mitigating evidence that Mr. Delaney and/or Dr. Berger could have provided and then to proffer the testimony of these expert witnesses as to Bardo\u2019s mental health. In addition, the PCRA court specifically noted that lead counsel \u201cinexplicably\u201d delegated responsibility for the preparation and presentation of the penalty phase to second chair counsel, despite that attorney\u2019s lack of experience and training in capital litigation. Id. at 41-43.\nFinally, the PCRA court concluded that Bardo had suffered prejudice. The PCRA court found that the evidence presented at the PCRA hearing was not merely \u201cadditional evidence\u201d as to mitigating factors actually found by the jury, but \u201cappealed] as an entirely new presentation,\u201d including, for the first time, expert testimony and volumes of corroborating records. Id. at 44. Such evidence, in the PCRA court\u2019s view, was sufficient to warrant presentation to the jury of both the Section (e)(2) and the Section (e)(3) mitigating circumstances, which require the petitioner to establish, respectively, that he was under the influence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, and that his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired. In addition, the PCRA court concluded that the evidence \u201ccould and should have been presented for consideration under the catchall (e)(8) mitigator.\u201d Id. at 45. In its conclusion, the PCRA court stated: \u201cWe ... hold that there is a reasonable probability that had the PCRA evidence been introduced at the penalty phase of Bardo\u2019s capital murder trial, one or more jurors were reasonably likely to have found additional mitigating circumstances and that those mitigating circumstances outweighed the aggravating circumstances.\u201d Id. at 44-46. For the following reasons, we would reverse the PCRA court\u2019s holding in the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal.\nWe address first the evidence of Bardo\u2019s alcohol abuse, intoxication at the time of the offenses, and alcohol dependence which were included in the list of Bardo\u2019s mental health diagnoses by one or more of his PCRA expert witnesses. All of the PCRA expert witnesses, including the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, Dr. O\u2019Brien, agreed that Bardo had a history of alcohol abuse. There was uncontested evidence from two experts, based on estimates of Bardo\u2019s alcohol consumption in the hours before the offenses, that his blood alcohol content at the time of the offenses was .09% or .10%. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/10/09, at 286, & 11/9/09, at 209 (estimates of Mr. Delaney and Dr. Lage, respectively). Bardo\u2019s PCRA expert witnesses all opined that he had been drinking and was intoxicated to some degree at the time of the offenses. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 18-19, 40, 94,109; 11/10/09, at 286-87; & 11/13/09, at 538-39. With regard to alcohol dependence, the expert opinions were more varied. Mr. Delaney and Dr. O\u2019Brien opined that Bardo was not alcohol dependent. Id., 11/10/09, at 294-96; & 11/13/09, at 642. Dr. Blumberg and Dr. Berger opined that he was alcohol dependent, but the latter expressed many qualifications to this diagnosis, including related to the time period of the dependency and the lack of any documentation that Bardo had ever experienced withdrawal symptoms. Id., 11/9/09, at 18-19, 41-44, 147; & 11/13/09, at 534-37, 569-74. This expert testimony was based on Bardo\u2019s self-reports during his mental health evaluations, a corroborating history of public intoxication requiring police intervention, and hospital reports from two incidents in which Bardo had seriously injured himself while intoxicated in 1984 and 1985, when he was, fifteen and sixteen years of age.\nWith regard to Bardo\u2019s intoxication on the night of the offenses, his argument places considerable emphasis on the estimates of two experts that his blood alcohol level bordered on the then-legal limit under the Motor Vehicle Code. However, in our view, those estimates should be of little moment in the present inquiry. The standard for proof of voluntary intoxication is the same in the guilt and penalty phases. Commonwealth v. Marinelli, 570 Pa. 622, 810 A.2d 1257, 1277 (2002) (citing Commonwealth v. Carpenter, 533 Pa. 40, 617 A.2d 1263, 1268 (1992)). Specifically, to establish the Section 9711(e)(3) mitigating factor, \u201cthe evidence would have to show that the [accused] was overwhelmed or overpowered by alcohol to the point of losing his faculties so as to be incapable of forming a specific intent to kill.\u201d Commonwealth v. Flor, 606 Pa. 384, 998 A.2d 606, 627 n. 7 (2010) (quoting Marinetti, supra at 1277). There is no evidence in the record to suggest that Bardo met this standard for intoxication; in fact, the evidence at trial was overwhelmingly to the contrary. In this respect, we agree with the Commonwealth\u2019s presentation in its brief to this Court at pages 22 through 41.\nIn his interviews with police detectives on September 3 and 4, 1992, Bardo recalled in detail the events just prior to, during, and after the child\u2019s murder. Bardo remembered going to the Sans Souci Lounge with his assistant manager, Robert Kisankowski, on September 2, 1992, at approximately midnight, after finishing his shift at the local Burger Bang and going home to change his clothing. He remembered sharing three pitchers of Coors Light beer with Mr. Kisankowski and conversing with two other patrons. He remembered the name of the band that was playing. He remembered leaving the bar at approximately 1:50 a.m. in Mr. Kisankowski\u2019s car, and returning to the home that he shared with his mother and stepfather. He remembered that his mother and his niece were sleeping together on an L-shaped sofa in the living room when he returned home, and he remembered what they were wearing. He remembered eating some soup and bread when he came home. He remembered rubbing his niece\u2019s legs and buttocks, stopping for a little while when she began to move around, going to the kitchen, returning to the living room, and then starting to rub the child again and placing his finger in her vagina. When she started to whine, he \u201cfreaked out\u201d and covered her mouth with his hand. He went again to the kitchen, and when he returned to the living room, he realized the child was not breathing. He again \u201cfreaked out,\u201d but had the wherewithal to attempt to hide her body, first placing the child in a trash bag from the kitchen cabinet, and then leaving his home by the back door and throwing her body in a nearby creek. He remembered returning home after disposing of her body, washing his work uniform, and then going to bed for the night. See N.T. Guilt Phase, 1/25/93, at 189-98 (testimony of Detective Michael Dessoye); & 1/26/93, at 252, 259-62, 270-72 (testimony of State Police Corporal Michael White, which included reading Bardo\u2019s statement to police). In our view, these deliberate, directed, controlled, self-aware actions, all recalled by Bardo and all supported by the evidence at trial, significantly undermined any claim of overwhelming, overpowering intoxication to the point of losing one\u2019s faculties.\nFurthermore, we see nothing in the record testimony of Bardo\u2019s own experts to support the necessary standard of intoxication to establish the Section 9711(e)(3) mitigator. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 538 (testimony of Dr. Berger: \u201cI would have been able to say [that] there would be some impact on his functionality based on his alcohol use.\u201d); & 11/10/09, at 283 (testimony of Mr. Delaney that based on his estimate that Bardo\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time of the offenses was .09%, Bardo\u2019s impulse control would have been \u201cgreatly diminished\u201d and his \u201cneed for immediate gratification would have been higher\u201d); & 11/9/09, at 212-13 (testimony of Dr. Lage that a typical individual with a blood alcohol level of .10% would exhibit impaired judgment, a loss to some extent of inhibitions, diminished coordination); id. at 94 (testimony of Dr. Blumberg that Bardo \u201chas a lengthy history of drinking excessively and also engaging in very impulsive, poorly thought-out behaviors when under the influence of alcohol, in particular, becom[ing] disinhibited sexually when under the influence of alcohol\u201d); id. at 109 (testimony of Dr. Blumberg that, when he interviewed Bardo fifteen years after the offenses, Bardo told him that he had \u201cfelt a buzz, felt under the influence of alcohol\u201d when he reached home on the night of the offenses). None of these expert opinions supported a finding that Bardo was overwhelmed or overpowered by alcohol to the point of losing his faculties, and thus none can be relied on to support a finding of Section 9711(e)(3) mitigation. Accord Gibson II, 19 A.3d at 529.\nBardo appears to argue that his voluntary intoxication should also have been considered as a Section 9711(e)(2) mitigating factor, i.e., extreme mental or emotional disturbance. Based on our analysis above, we conclude that no proffered evidence supported this statutory mitigator, as the Commonwealth explains in its brief at pages 41 and 42. The testimony of Bardo\u2019s experts that there was \u201csome impact on his functionality\u201d due to alcohol use, that his impulse control was \u201cgreatly diminished\u201d and he became \u201cdisinhibited sexually\u201d when intoxicated, and that he self-reported feeling a \u201cbuzz\u201d on the night of the offenses, does not, in our view, constitute sufficient evidence that he was subject to extreme mental or emotional disturbance. See Commonwealth v. Saranchak, 581 Pa. 490, 866 A.2d 292, 305-06 (2005) (defendant\u2019s history of mental health difficulties and alcoholism, and likelihood of having been intoxicated at time of offenses are concerns distinct from extreme mental or emotional disturbance, pursuant to Section 9711(e)(2)).\nIn sum, we find no evidence presented at the penalty phase or at the PCRA hearing to support a claim that Bardo\u2019s voluntary intoxication on the night of the offenses was a mitigating circumstance under either the Section 9711(e)(2) or (e)(3) statutory mitigators.\nA jury may, of course, consider alcohol consumption and abuse as a possible mitigating factor under the catch-all mitigator, Section 9711(e)(8) (\u201cAny other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.\u201d). See Gibson II, 19 A.3d at 529 (citing Flor, 998 A.2d at 627 n. 7); Commonwealth v. Laird, 605 Pa. 137, 988 A.2d 618, 624 n. 1 (2010). However, it is important to note that nothing in our decisional law suggests that alcohol abuse or consumption on the day of the offense is, in and of itself, a mitigating circumstance under subsection 9711(e)(8) or any other statutory provision. Indeed, as this Court has previously noted, jurors are aware of a volitional component to the use of alcohol and of alcohol\u2019s disinhibiting effect, and thus, it is far from clear that alcohol use or abuse has consistent or substantial mitigating value. The U.S. Supreme Court has suggested the same. See Gibson II, 19 A.3d at 527 (citing Montana v. Egelhoff, 518 U.S. 37, 44, 116 S.Ct. 2013, 135 L.Ed.2d 361 (1996) (plurality) for proposition that \u201chistorically, voluntary intoxication has been viewed by society as aggravating the severity of a given offense\u201d).\nBased on the testimony of Bardo and his mother, some members of the jury did find that Bardo\u2019s alcohol abuse was a mitigating factor under Section 9711(e)(8). The additional evidence proffered at the PCRA hearing was expert testimony addressing Bardo\u2019s alcohol abuse and intoxication at the time of the murder. However, trial counsel\u2019s testimony at the PCRA hearing is also relevant here. Specifically, trial counsel testified that Bardo had told him that he was not drunk on the night of the offenses and that he knew what he was doing. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/12/09, at 394. Trial counsel further testified that he did not consider as mitigating the facts that Bardo \u201cdrank beer, killed [ ] and molested his niece.\u201d Id. at 373 (\u201c[T]he fact that [Bardo] went to the Sans Souci Lounge and [ ] drank beer, [ ] and came home and killed her, wasn\u2019t something that I was really [ ] too heavy on pursuing.\u201d). We cannot' say that trial counsel\u2019s view that Bardo\u2019s voluntary intoxication on the night of the offenses lacked mitigation value was constitutionally unreasonable.,\nWith regard to alcohol dependence and any resulting mitigation value, the PCRA testimony, including that of Bardo\u2019s three expert witnesses who addressed his alcohol dependence, was inconsistent. Dr. Blumberg was the strongest proponent of the view that Bardo was alcohol dependent, basing his diagnosis primarily on Bardo\u2019s various self-reports of blackouts; tolerance; getting \u201cthe shakes\u201d; drinking to get drunk; and \u201can awareness that [ ] he gets into trouble when he drinks [but] an inability or awareness to stop drinking.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 147; see also id. at 149 (Dr. Blumberg testified that Bardo\u2019s \u201creport and the history that he describes is absolutely supportive of alcohol dependence, at the very least alcohol abuse\u201d); see also id. at 150 (Dr. Blumberg testified that Bardo described \u201ca clear cut history [of] a severe alcohol problem with tolerance,\u201d and clarified that a \u201cdiagnosis of alcohol dependence is based on the history\u201d). However, Dr. Blumberg recognized that Bardo\u2019s self-report of tremors was the only evidence that he had ever experienced any symptoms of withdrawal, one of the indicators of alcohol dependence. Id. at 41,128, 131-33.\nAlthough Dr. Berger also diagnosed Bardo as alcohol dependent, he suggested a number of qualifications, most importantly related to the timing of the dependence. In the context of a line of questioning during cross-examination about Bar-do\u2019s childhood and teenage years, when asked whether Bardo was alcohol dependent, Dr. Berger responded: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say. I mean, I think there probably was [alcohol] dependence during those years. ... [T]here is ample documentation from the numerous times he was locked up in the drunk tank and what he described as too numerous to count arrests for alcoholism and sort of a pattern of clear alcohol abuse, can I say 100 per cent it was dependence? No, I can\u2019t. Clearly, it heads in that direction if it\u2019s not.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 569 (emphasis added). Furthermore, Dr. Berger testified that he could not document that Bardo had \u201cwithdrawal symptomology\u201d at the time of the offenses, id. at 574, raising a question as to the relevance of his diagnosis of alcohol dependence.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Delaney had concluded in 1993 that Bardo was not alcohol dependent. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/10/09, at 294-96; see Psychological Evaluation of Michael Bardo by Ned Delaney, dated 1/27/93 (\u201c1993 Psychological Evaluation\u201d). Like Mr. Delaney, Dr. O\u2019Brien concluded that Bardo was not alcohol dependent, based on the lack of any indication that Bardo had ever experienced withdrawal symptoms during any of his several hospitalizations or incarcerations, as well as the lack of evidence of escalating use of alcohol or tolerance, especially during the two years prior to the current offenses when Bardo was working, functioning, undergoing counseling, and drinking on a social basis without experiencing a great deal of difficulty. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 614-15, 625, 642, 648-49; see also id. at 649 (Dr. O\u2019Brien testified that the diagnostic criteria for alcohol dependence require \u201cphysiological dependence on alcohol[, which is] indicated by evidence of tolerance or symptoms of withdrawal, and [] tolerance would be an increase and escalating amount of alcohol over time,\u201d and concluding that there was no evidence for these diagnostic criteria in Bardo\u2019s records). Consistent with Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s and Mr. Delaney\u2019s views, it was undisputed that, even though Bardo had been admitted to the hospital once in 1984, three times in 1985, and once in 1988, and had been incarcerated several times, there was no documentation in any of the hospital or prison records that Bardo had ever suffered symptoms of or had been treated for alcohol withdrawal. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 118-19, 128, 131-33, 149; & 11/13/09, at 571-72, 574, 648.\nOn this record, we would conclude that there is no reasonable probability that any juror would have found that Bardo\u2019s alleged alcohol dependence was an additional mitigating factor under Section 9711(e)(8), the catch-all mitigating circumstance, and then reached a different sentencing verdict. Our view is informed by the inconsistency of the testimony regarding alcohol dependence, even among Bardo\u2019s own expert witnesses; the reliance of all the experts exclusively on Bardo\u2019s self-reports for their conclusions regarding his alleged alcohol dependence; the equivocation of Dr. Berger on this issue; the fact that the strongest proponent of Bardo\u2019s alleged alcohol dependence, Dr. Blumberg, only interviewed Bardo in 2008, after he had been imprisoned for approximately fifteen years for his offenses; open questions as to the time period of any dependence; and the lack of any documentation that Bardo had ever suffered withdrawal symptoms during any of his hospitalizations or incarcerations. Moreover, similar to voluntary intoxication, alcohol dependence is not in and of itself a mitigating circumstance; more is required beyond the mere averment of dependence. Here, Bardo has done little more than to assert that he was alcohol dependent. In sum, we would conclude that Bardo has not carried his burden to show that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony regarding his abuse of alcohol, voluntary intoxication, and/or alcohol dependence. In reaching this conclusion, we do not discount the possibilities that some additional jurors might have found alcohol abuse as a mitigating factor, or that the juror(s) who found alcohol abuse as a mitigating factor might have applied more weight to this factor. However, for the reasons discussed above, we would find that the totality of any mitigating circumstances based on alcohol-related factors is minimal when compared to the egregious aggravating circumstances in this case, which involved the strangulation murder of a young child during an indecent assault. Accordingly, we would conclude that Bardo was not prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to present expert testimony regarding alcohol-related factors.\nWe turn now to the evidence of Bardo\u2019s other psychiatric diagnoses, and the effect that his difficult childhood had on his mental health, as presented by the experts who evaluated him shortly before the PCRA hearing, which took place fifteen years after the offenses. In Dr. Blumberg\u2019s opinion, at the time of the offenses, in addition to alcohol intoxication and alcohol dependence, Bardo suffered from four other mental disorders: chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d); dysthymic disorder; personality disorder not otherwise specified (\u201cNOS\u201d) with schizoid, depressive, and inadequate features; and pedophilia. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 18-19. Dr. Blumberg also testified to Bardo\u2019s social and psychiatric history, as obtained from the interview with Bardo and from records readily available to trial counsel, including the extreme neglect, abuse, and chaos experienced by Bardo as a young child; his genetic pre-disposition to alcoholism, based on his father\u2019s alcoholism; his regular, heavy drinking beginning in his pre-teen years that had led to blackouts and risk of injury to himself or others; his sexual victimization at the hands of an older man during childhood; and his two suicide attempts and three psychiatric interventions. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 19-99; see PCRA Court Opinion at 28-32. Based on the combination and confluence of these diagnoses and factors, Dr. Blumberg further opined that two statutory mitigating circumstances were applicable: at the time of the offenses, Bardo was substantially impaired in his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(3), and Bardo was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, id. \u00a7 9711(e)(2). N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 19; Dr. Blumberg\u2019s Affidavit/Declaration at 12-13, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.\nDr. Berger, Bardo\u2019s other psychiatrist-expert, opined that, at the time of the offenses, along with chronic aleohol/substance abuse and alcoholism, Bardo suffered from \u201cmajor depression recurrent, very possibly dysthymic, and ... symptoms of PTSD.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 528. Dr. Berger testified that Bardo \u201cwas self-reared[, having] had no rearing as a young child or a medium child.\u201d Id. at 530. Dr. Berger also testified that Bardo had started drinking alcohol at an early age and had experienced a home environment \u201cat best neglectful,\u201d with inadequate food and dirty clothing. Id. at 533-34; see id. at 541 (testifying that the records show that Bardo \u201cwas brought up in a very dysfunctional family with little or no parenting skills,\u201d by a mother who had had six children by the age of twenty-six, with essentially no father figure in the household). Expanding on the chronic neglect Bardo had experienced as a child, Dr. Berger noted that he was one of the poorest in a group of poor children, was teased, was small for his age, and wore ill-fitting clothing. Id. at 542. Dr. Berger also noted that Bardo\u2019s family had moved frequently during his adolescence, and opined that these moves were significant because \u201cit\u2019s often disruptive to children to have to move multiple times, because there is no sense of a secure environment,\u201d a potential detriment with even more impact due to Bardo\u2019s dysfunctional family. Id. at 546. Based on his review of the records of Bardo\u2019s mental health history and on information from Bardo directly, Dr. Berger opined that the Section 9711(e)(2) mitigating circumstance was applicable, i.e., at the time of the offenses, Bardo was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 549.\nDr. O\u2019Brien, the Commonwealth\u2019s psychiatric expert, testified that Bardo suffered from mixed personality disorder with antisocial, dependent, and avoidant features, as well as long-term alcohol abuse. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 642, 662, 705. Dr. O\u2019Brien explained that the avoidant feature referred to feelings of inadequacy, social ineptness, and immaturity. Id. at 710-11. Although his mental health diagnoses were distinct from and more limited than those of Dr. Blumberg or Dr. Berger, Dr. O\u2019Brien agreed that Bardo was raised in a dysfunctional family, citing his \u201cunkept\u201d home, his dirty clothing, inadequate food, lack of parental supervision and intervention, drinking at an early age, frequent moves with related changes of school, financial difficulties, neglect, and discipline involving physical abuse with a belt or paddle. Id. at 671-79, 693-95. However, Dr. O\u2019Brien concluded, based on the records and his evaluation of Bardo, that neither statutory mitigator, Section 9711(e)(2) or (e)(3), was applicable. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 714, 719.\nThe PCRA court focused primarily on the testimony of Dr. Blumberg and Dr. O\u2019Brien, concluding that \u201cboth are credible, but on the basis of what we saw and what we heard, we are persuaded by and more comfortable with the testimony presented by PCRA counsel.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion at 34. The PCRA court concluded that Bardo had established that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to proffer as mitigation evidence expert testimony regarding his history of mental health issues, his psychiatric diagnoses, and his childhood of neglect and abuse, which contributed to his psychiatric problems.\nThe Commonwealth argues that such evidence would have been cumulative of what the jury actually heard at trial and sentencing. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 66-67. We would find that the evidence presented at the PCRA hearing would not have led to a different penalty verdict. In our view, the record does not fully support the PCRA court\u2019s findings, and the court considered only the evidence in mitigation presented at the PCRA hearing, without weighing that evidence against the aggravating circumstances. Our re-weighing of the totality of the mitigating factors, including the additional evidence in mitigation presented at the PCRA hearing, as against the egregious aggravating factors in this case, leads us to conclude that Bardo was not prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to present expert testimony in the penalty phase as to Bardo\u2019s psychiatric history and diagnoses and his childhood environment.\nThe PCRA court particularly criticized trial counsel\u2019s failure to obtain and utilize all of Bardo\u2019s records, from school, Luzerne County Children and Youth Services (\u201cLCCYS\u201d), juvenile probation authorities, and from his various hospitalizations. We consider first the school records. The PCRA court expressly found that \u201cTrial Counsel failed to obtain ... school records for Bardo.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion at 36. However, this conclusion is not supported by the certified record. As noted, through the testimony of an assistant principal, penalty phase counsel presented numerous school records, detailing Bardo\u2019s poor academic performance from an early age until he left school at age seventeen. See N.T. Penalty Phase, 1/28/93 at 710-28. In addition, two of Bardo\u2019s teachers testified to his poor performance in school, his unkempt appearance, and his uninvolved parents. Id. at 729-35, 747-49. Bardo has not specified, and the PCRA court has not clarified, what additional school records trial counsel should have obtained and utilized, and what additional insights these unspecified records might have offered. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the unspecified school records to which the PCRA court referred would have provided anything more than cumulative information to the testimony of the assistant principal and teachers.\nIn the context of school records, the PCRA court\u2019s opinion specifically mentions only the records of the Children\u2019s Service Center concerning Bardo\u2019s efforts in the program\u2019s Adolescent Learning Center when he was fifteen or sixteen years of age. See PCRA Court Opinion at 36; N.T. Penalty Phase at 727-28, 787-88 (respectively, assistant principal\u2019s testimony and Bardo\u2019s testimony). The PCRA court noted \u201c[ajpropos of Counsels\u2019 stewardship,\u201d that trial counsel had neglected to call as a witness a representative from the Children\u2019s Service Center for the purpose of admitting these records. PCRA Court Opinion at 36. During the PCRA proceedings, it was stipulated that trial counsel\u2019s files included Children\u2019s Service Center records for Bardo. See Stipulation between Petitioner and the Commonwealth regarding PCRA Hearing Testimony of Jessica Johnson, at \u00b6 2. However, the content of the Children\u2019s Service Center records was never mentioned, never presented, and never discussed during the PCRA proceedings. PCRA counsel did not suggest, and the PCRA court did not determine, what information or insights would have been gained by admission of these records.\nThus, based on the certified record before us, we would conclude that Bardo has not established ineffective assistance based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to proffer his Children\u2019s Service Center records or any other school records.\nWith respect to Bardo\u2019s home environment during his childhood and early teenage years, as we have already summarized, Bardo\u2019s mother and Bardo himself testified at the penalty phase concerning his difficult and unsupervised childhood, exemplified by his alcohol abuse beginning as a pre-teenager, the sexual abuse he experienced as a way of obtaining alcohol, and his two suicide attempts. The dysfunctional, chaotic, neglectful, unsupportive, and abusive nature of Bardo\u2019s childhood was further developed and presented at the PCRA hearing by expert witnesses, who based their testimony largely on Bardo\u2019s juvenile probation file and his LCCYS file, as well as on what Bardo himself related to them. PCRA Court Opinion at 29. More specifically, the PCRA court determined that the following was not presented to the sentencing jury: Bardo\u2019s genetic pre-disposition to alcoholism based on the fact that his biological father was an alcoholic; Bardo\u2019s own drinking at an early age, resulting in blackouts and injury to himself; Bardo\u2019s history of sexual victimization, as revealed through records, and not just uncorroborated family testimony; and Bardo\u2019s psychiatric interventions, hospitalizations, and diagnoses following his two suicide attempts. Id. at 29-31. Nevertheless, based on our review of the penalty phase testimony and the relevant records, we would conclude that the PCRA court\u2019s ultimate determination is not supported by the record. As summarized above, Bardo and his mother testified at the penalty phase regarding his biological father\u2019s alcoholism; Bardo\u2019s heavy drinking beginning in his preteen years, which his mother was unable to control and which caused him to \u201cfall into the house\u201d some nights; his sexual abuse at the hands of an older male in order to obtain alcohol; and his two suicide attempts. Much of the testimony presented by defense experts at the PCRA hearing was merely cumulative of the testimony provided by Bardo and his mother.\nFurthermore, after thoroughly reviewing Bardo\u2019s childhood records cited by the PCRA court as missing from penalty phase consideration, see PCRA Court Opinion at 29 (citing Petitioner\u2019s Exhibits 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7), we would conclude that they do not describe a childhood home environment materially distinct from or worse than that described by Bardo himself and his mother at the penalty hearing. For example, PCRA counsel put great emphasis on an LCCYS Case Report dated July 20, 1972, when Bardo was three years old and had been admitted, along with one of his siblings, to a day-care home. See Case Record re: Michael Bardo, dated 7/20/72, prepared by Caseworker Mariellen Fine (\u201c1972 Bardo Case Record\u201d) (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 4). LCCYS apparently made these daycare arrangements to assist Bardo\u2019s mother. Id. at 1. PCRA counsel emphasized the caseworker\u2019s findings that Bardo was \u201crather dirty\u201d when he came daily to the home, and that \u201cthe children stated they were not being fed at home.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/12/09, at 348 (citing 1972 Bardo Case Record at 2). However, the document must be considered in its entirety before evaluating its possible import. Bardo\u2019s mother denied the accusation that she was not feeding her children and was said to be \u201cextremely upset\u201d by the charge. 1972 Bardo Case Record at 2. The caseworker further noted that Bardo was \u201cnot a very good eater\u201d and would not eat very much; nonetheless, she described him as \u201cof normal size and appearing] to be developing normally ... [and] appearing] to be a normal, healthy little boy.\u201d Id. at 1-2. She also noted an attachment to and close relationship with his mother. The caseworker concluded that Bardo had made progress in the day-care home, that he enjoyed playing with the other children and going outside to play, that he talked constantly, that he was a very polite child, and that he listened attentively to instructions. Id. at 1-2. Thus, the 1972 Bardo Case Report is far from uniformly negative in describing Bardo\u2019s earliest years. As set forth in another document cited by the PCRA court, the LCCYS file on the Bardo family was closed on May 31, 1984, after fourteen years of services. See Letter from LCCYS to Jean McCoskey, Chief Probation Officer of the Luzerne County Juvenile Court, dated 1/16/86 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 3). The letter indicated that there had been no contact with the Bardo family since the file was closed, there was no reason given as to why the file was closed, and there is no indication from the records that the file was ever reopened. Thus, other than clarifying that LCCYS involvement with the Bardo family ended for unspecified reasons when Bardo was fifteen, this letter offered no helpful insights, except to document that LCCYS had been involved with the Bardo family in unspecified ways for many years.\nAnother record cited by the PCRA court was a \u201cSocial Investigation\u201d concerning Bardo\u2019s older brother George, dated April 3, 1981, after he had apparently been arrested for damaging a school. See Social Investigation Re: George Bar-do, dated 4/3/81 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 5). The document indicated that Bardo\u2019s mother reported as her only income $379 from Social Security, and that the family resided in a \u201cvery poorly kept\u201d apartment, which was \u201cdark and dirty with soiled clothing visible.\u201d Id. Two other documents are short and undetailed juvenile probation records with regard to Bardo, prepared when he was ages twelve and sixteen, respectively. See Luzerne County Juvenile Probation Records, dated 4/10/82, and 6/3/85 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibits 6 and 7, respectively). In the first probation document, the supervisor concluded that Bardo\u2019s progress had been fair, recommended that his case be closed, but cautioned that he would probably not avoid trouble in the future because his supervision at home was \u201cterrible.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 6. As summarized in the second probation document, Bardo had been arrested on unspecified charges, and he subsequently stated that he had been drinking and was drunk at the time of his arrest; in addition, his mother stated that he was uncontrollable when he was drinking. Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 7. These records, cited by the PCRA court, clearly set forth a troubled household and a troubled youth, but they do not present a picture materially different from that provided by trial counsel, through the testimony of Bardo, his mother, and school personnel.\nAfter reviewing all the records related to Bardo\u2019s childhood environment, particularly those cited by the PCRA court as not having been presented by trial counsel, and all the testimony presented at the penalty phase and PCRA hearings, we do not dispute that Bardo\u2019s childhood was characterized by neglect, a lack of supervision, abuse, and impoverishment. However, this is not the ultimate question. Testimony presented during the penalty phase described all these aspects of Bardo\u2019s childhood and the environment in which he was raised. The expert testimony presented at the PCRA hearing was largely cumulative of that prior testimony and presented only relatively minor fresh insights. Counsel is not ineffective merely because he or she fails to present expert testimony concerning a defendant\u2019s childhood history and home life that would have been cumulative of testimony presented by a defendant\u2019s mother. See Commonwealth v. Lark, 548 Pa. 441, 698 A.2d 43, 51 (1997). Thus, we would hold that Bardo\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present expert testimony concerning his childhood and the environment in which he was raised fails.\nWith respect to Bardo\u2019s own sexual victimization as a teenager, it is important to remember that, during the penalty phase, both Bardo and his mother testified that he had experienced sexual abuse in exchange for the provision of alcohol during his teenage years. The PCRA court determined that this abuse was \u201cwell-documented in records readily available to Trial Counsel,\u201d but was not proffered as corroborating evidence. PCRA Court Opinion at 30 (citing four documents: Petitioner\u2019s Exhibits 23, 24, and 25, and Commonwealth\u2019s Exhibit 3). However, two aspects of these records greatly decrease their significance and import. First, with respect to Bardo\u2019s sexual abuse, the documents contain only his self-reports; thus, the four documents corroborate Bardo\u2019s penalty phase testimony only to the extent that a self-report can be corroborated by a prior self-report. See, e.g., N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 563 (testimony of Dr. Berger acknowledging that there was no independent corroboration of Bardo\u2019s self-report of sexual abuse). Bardo\u2019s self-reports of sexual abuse in the documents were merely cumulative of the penalty phase testimony of Bardo and his mother.\nSecond, and more importantly, the documents all originated shortly after Bardo\u2019s arrest for prior sex-related offenses, i.e., the statutory rape and indecent assault of another three-year-old niece in February 1988, when Bardo was eighteen years of age, offenses to which he pled guilty. The first time Bardo disclosed the sexual abuse was during a February 27, 1988 interview with police concerning these prior sexual offenses. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 121-24 (testimony of Dr. Blumberg as to Bardo\u2019s statement to police on 2/27/88 (Commonwealth Exhibit 3)). The other three documents cited by the PCRA court likewise contain simply Bardo\u2019s self-reports of sexual abuse in the context of his psychological evaluations following his February 1988 arrest. See Multimodal Life History Questionnaire, completed by Michael Bardo, 8/12/88, (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 23) at \u00b6 9.D.7 (in response to a request for information about any significant homosexual reactions or relationships, reporting that he \u201cwas raped when [he] was 13 by a man\u201d); Autobiography Outline, Transitional Sex Offender Program, completed by Michael Bardo, 1988, (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 24) at 2, \u00b6 C.ll (in response to the question \u201cwho scared or humiliated you sexually? How? When?\u201d, writing \u201cHis name was Tony Koonrad. He got me drunk then raped me[.] I was about 12 years old[.]\u201d); Intake Evaluation of Michael Bardo by Community Counseling Services of N.E. PA, dated 7/27/88, (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 25) at 2 (self-report of sexual assault by a friend ten years older, beginning at age thirteen and continuing until Bardo\u2019s marriage at age seventeen); see also N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 124 and 130 (Dr. Blumberg testifying that \u201cI think we can all agree that prior to [Bardo\u2019s] being accused of molesting his niece [in 1988], he did not admit that he had been sexually assaulted himself.\u201d).\nBased on the above considerations, and contrary to Bardo\u2019s assertions, we would conclude that the above-cited documents at issue had only marginal value in corroborating Bardo\u2019s alleged abuse, and, in addition, were potentially highly prejudicial to Bardo. The documents serve to \u201ccorroborate\u201d Bar-do\u2019s testimonial self-report of abuse only via a similar, albeit earlier, self-report \u2014 made in the context of a criminal offense, disturbingly similar to the instant offense. Proffering the documents as evidence, rather than simply relying on the testimony of Bardo and his mother regarding his sexual victimization, may very well have opened the door for the Commonwealth to present evidence regarding the criminal circumstances that gave rise to the documents, evidence that would have been highly prejudicial to Bardo. Not surprisingly, trial counsel made clear that he successfully sought to exclude any evidence relating to Bardo\u2019s prior sexual offense against a minor. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/12/09, at 388, 414-15. This was a reasonable strategy. Furthermore, Bardo has not established prejudice because, in our judgment, any potential \u2019additional mitigation value of his prior self-reports of sexual victimization would have been minimal, and would not have led to a different penalty verdict, particularly given the egregious aggravating circumstances of this case. Accordingly, we would conclude that Bardo\u2019s claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness for failing to proffer the 1988 documents to \u201ccorroborate\u201d his and his mother\u2019s penalty phase testimony regarding his alleged sexual victimization fails.\nFinally, with respect specifically to Bardo\u2019s psychiatric history and diagnoses, the PCRA court emphasized the \u201cinexplicable]\u201d failure of trial counsel to present the expert testimony of Dr. Berger and Mr. Delaney, despite their having been retained by trial counsel to evaluate Bardo prior to trial. PCRA Court Opinion at 37, 40-43 (finding that trial counsel had no reasonable strategic or tactical basis for this omission). After initially evaluating Bardo in 1993, Dr. Berger did not prepare a report, but merely indicated to trial counsel that his findings would not be helpful in the guilt phase of trial, e.g., with respect to competency or defenses such as diminished capacity, guilty but mentally ill, or insanity; however, Dr. Berger also indicated that, if the trial were to include a penalty phase, he might be able to assist in some unspecified way. Trial counsel did not follow up on this possibility and apparently never re-contacted Dr. Berger. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/12/09, at 488-92 (testimony of lead trial counsel, Joseph Yeager, Esq.); id., 1/13/09, at 519-23 (testimony of Dr. Berger); Letter from Dr. Berger to Mr. Yeager, dated 1/13/93 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 35). Counsel testified that he had no strategic basis for not re-contacting Dr. Berger to further discuss his potential ability to assist in the penalty phase. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/12/09, at 489-90. Similarly, counsel testified that Mr. Delaney was not considered as an expert witness for the penalty phase, but should have been so considered. Id. at 477-84. The PCRA court concluded that Bardo established Pierce/Strickland ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to present the testimony of Dr. Berger and Mr. Delaney with regard to Bardo\u2019s psychiatric history and diagnoses. We conclude otherwise.\nMr. Delaney was retained by trial counsel in 1993 \u201cto determine the scope, depth and extent of Mr. Bardo\u2019s use and abuse of alcoholic beverages and concomitant impact on his behavior.\u201d 1993 Psychological Evaluation. Mr. Delaney concluded that Bardo had entered into a pattern of alcohol and drug abuse at the age of eleven, and his then-current drug of choice was beer. Id. Mr. Delaney opined that Bardo\u2019s \u201chistory and current behavior [are] consistent with the diagnostic criteria established to determine alcohol abuse.\u201d Id. at 2. Importantly, this diagnosis \u2014 of alcohol abuse \u2014 was the only mental health diagnosis made by Mr. Delaney. We have already discussed in detail our reasons for rejecting Bardo\u2019s claim respecting the value in mitigation of alcohol-related factors, and we need not repeat that analysis.\nWith regard to Dr. Berger, the circumstances are more complicated. Dr. Berger based his PCRA opinion testimony on his 2009 re-evaluation of Bardo and his review of Bardo\u2019s self-reports and numerous records. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 525-26, 565-66. Dr. Berger testified that he did not recall whether, following his 1993 pre-trial evaluation, he had concluded that Bardo was suffering from any psychiatric disorders. Id. at 554-55.\nWhen asked during the PCRA hearing whether Bardo suffered from mental illness at the time of the offenses, Dr. Berger answered as follows: \u201cI believe that based on what [Bardo] told me and the history that he did.... I reached the opinion that [Bardo] was suffering with major depression recurrent, very possibly dysthymic, and also at the time I saw him most recently, he had some symptoms of [PTSD] and some of what he told me about the events at the time would also indicate he had symptoms of PTSD,\u201d along with alcohol abuse and long term alcoholism. Id. at 527-28. When asked whether Bardo, at the time of the offenses, suffered from an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, i.e., statutory mitigator Section 9711(e)(2), Dr. Berger answered as follows: \u201cAgain, I don\u2019t remember specifically at the time. I\u2019m basing it on the information that I had gotten and the answer would be yes ... [b]ased on the record review that I had indicating the previous mental health history and also the information contained [sic] from Mr. Bardo directly.\u201d Id. at 549.\nThe records of Bardo\u2019s mental health history that Dr. Berger relied on were from Bardo\u2019s psychiatric admissions in the summer of 1985, when he was sixteen, after he twice attempted suicide, and in February 1988, when he was nineteen, after his arrest for his first sexual offense against a three-year-old niece. As revealed by these records, Bardo first received psychiatric care after his first suicide attempt, which was apparently prompted by an argument and suicide pact with his girlfriend, leading both to take an overdose of medication. First Hospital Wyoming Valley, Psychiatric Admission Note, dated 7/19/85 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 11); First Hospital Wyoming Valley, Social Service Assessment, dated 7/31/85 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 17). Bardo\u2019s second suicide attempt, in which he cut his wrist while intoxicated after another argument with his girlfriend, occurred only weeks after the first attempt. He stated at that time that he was very depressed because his girlfriend was residing in a group home in another city. Wyoming Valley Clinic, handwritten note, dated 8/23/85 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 10); First Hospital Wyoming Valley, Discharge Summary, dated 9/17/85 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 18); Luzerne-Wyoming County Mental Health Center, Crisis Intervention, dated 8/23/85 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 19). At the time of these 1985 suicide attempts, Bardo was diagnosed with major depression, recurrent; and conduct disorder, socialized, aggressive. First Hospital Wyoming Valley, Psychiatric Admission Note, dated 7/19/85 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 11); First Hospital Wyoming Valley, Discharge Summary, dated 9/17/85 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 18).\nAt the time of his 1988 psychiatric hospitalization, Bardo was diagnosed with a different set of psychiatric disorders: dysthymic disorder; adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features; and personality disorder, not otherwise specified (\u201cNOS\u201d). Wilkes-Barre General Hospital Discharge Face Sheet, dated 8/3/88 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 21); Community Counseling Services of N.E. PA, Diagnosis Form, Identifying Data, dated 7/27/88 (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 22). In an intake evaluation for the 1988 admission, Bardo reported being depressed and having thoughts of suicide since he raped his niece. Community Counseling Services of N.E. PA, Intake Evaluation, dated 7/27/88, (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 25) at 1. In this evaluation, Bardo\u2019s mental status was summarized as follows: cooperative; oriented to person, time, and place; coherent; depressed mood; intact memory; poor insight and judgment as to his current circumstances; and no indication of delusions or hallucinations. Id. at 3.\nWhen asked at the PCRA hearing whether he could have conveyed to the sentencing jury a mitigating portrayal of Bardo, Dr. Berger responded, in equivocal fashion: \u201cI think there were factors that I could have talked about that may have played a role, yeah.\u201d PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 533. Two main factors presented by Dr. Berger are relevant to this consideration: his diagnoses that at the time of the murder, Bardo suffered from major depression and PTSD. With regard to Dr. Berger\u2019s opinion that Bardo suffered from major depression, it is instructive to consider the timing of Bardo\u2019s various psychiatric diagnoses as revealed in the records. In 1985, after his two suicide attempts within weeks of each other at the age of sixteen, which was seven years prior to the current offenses, Bardo was diagnosed with major depression and a conduct disorder. Three years later, in 1988, following the molestation of his first niece, he was diagnosed with dysthymic disorder; adjustment disorder with mixed emotional features; and personality disorder NOS; however, he was not diagnosed with major depression. Dr. Berger explained that acute episodes of major depression can occur episodically in psychiatric patients, sometimes on top of dysthymic disorder, a low-grade, chronic type of depression. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09 at 566. On this record, the fact that Bardo was diagnosed with major depression in 1985, but not in 1988, may have constituted evidence that Bardo was subject to acute episodes of major depression, but it did not establish that Bardo suffered such an episode in 1992, specifically at the time of the September 1992 killing.\nDr. Berger explained the basis for his diagnosis of major depression at the time of the instant offenses as follows: \u201c[S]o I found anyway \u2014 and this is just my opinion \u2014 based on what [Bardo] told me[,] and also the recordsf,] that he was suffering from [major] depression.\u201d Id,.; see also id. at 527-28. However, Dr. Berger\u2019s testimony provided no insight as to what Bardo told him in 2009 that could have informed Dr. Berger\u2019s diagnosis of major depression at the time of the offenses in 1992. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Steele, 599 Pa. 341, 961 A.2d 786, 824 (2008) (finding problematic the testimony of mental health professionals who evaluated defendant for PCRA purposes fifteen years after offenses because experts did not explain how their evaluations in 2000 led to their conclusions regarding defendant\u2019s mental status at time of offenses in 1985). Accordingly, we would conclude that Dr. Berger\u2019s diagnosis of major depression at the time of the offenses did not have a strong evidentiary foundation.\nWith regard to Dr. Berger\u2019s opinion that Bardo suffered from \u201csymptoms\u201d of PTSD at the time of the offenses, it is important to recognize that Dr. Berger never specified what \u201csymptoms\u201d of PTSD he believed Bardo exhibited. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09 at 527-28, 559-61. On cross-examination, Dr. Berger testified that in 2009, he found only two residual symptoms: \u201csome nightmares of the sexual abuse and ... avoidant behavior, where he tends to avoid newspaper articles, television shows, things like that that have sexual abuse in them.\u201d Id. at 560. On this record, Dr. Berger\u2019s testimony provided no insight as to how Bardo\u2019s nightmares and/or his avoidant behavior were, or could be, manifest at the time of the offenses so as to constitute an extreme mental or emotional disturbance or otherwise be deemed of significant mitigation value in the context of a case involving his indecent assault and murder of a child.\nWhen asked about the triggering events for Bardo\u2019s symptoms of PTSD, Dr. Berger responded: \u201cI think there are a couple of things. First of all, I think his early childhood experiences of at least emotional neglect or abuse, as well as some physical questions of physical abuse [sic]. But more importantly, he was self reared. This kid really had no rearing as a young child or a medium child. And then he had a very significant homosexual sexual abuse from age 13.\u201d Id. at 529-30; see also id. at 561. Notably, despite three psychiatric admissions and psychiatric treatment much closer in time to Bardo\u2019s sexual victimization and other negative childhood experiences, there is no indication in any of the psychiatric records that Bardo ever experienced, reported, or was diagnosed with any symptoms of PTSD. In contrast, a diagnosis of PTSD, or its symptoms, was rendered only in 2008 or 2009, and only by psychiatrists retained for PCRA purposes, decades after the alleged sexual abuse and sixteen years after the current offenses.\nDr. Berger acknowledged that several of his conclusions, specifically with regard to Bardo\u2019s sexual victimization, nightmares, and avoidant behavior, were based exclusively on Bardo\u2019s self-reports. Id. at 563-65. While we do not suggest that Bardo\u2019s self-reports should be dismissed out of hand, the lack of any corroboration or prior PTSD diagnosis, despite ample opportunities for such within the voluminous records and multiple psychiatric interventions, certainly decreases the import of Dr. Berger\u2019s retrospective conclusions based exclusively on Bardo\u2019s self-reports.\nIf trial counsel had called Dr. Berger to testify at the penalty phase hearing, the jury would have had the responsibility to determine the credibility and weight to be afforded his testimony. Of course, Dr. Berger\u2019s testimony would not have gone to the jury unchallenged. The Commonwealth would have had the opportunity to inquire into the basis of his opinions via cross-examination, and to proffer its own expert. Indeed, at the PCRA hearing, on cross-examination, the Commonwealth strongly challenged Dr. Berger\u2019s opinion testimony and proffered the testimony of Dr. O\u2019Brien, who offered an alternative view of Bardo\u2019s mental state.\nSpecifically, Dr. O\u2019Brien found no evidence that Bardo suffered from depression either in 2009 or in 1992 at the time of the murder. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 601-06, 633, 657-58, 664-65. Dr. O\u2019Brien noted that, at the time of his 2009 interview, Bardo had received no psychiatric treatment for fourteen years, and opined that there had been no treatment because Bardo manifested no symptoms and thus no treatment was needed. Id. at 610, 622-23, 658-59. Dr. O\u2019Brien further opined that Bardo had experienced clinically significant depression only during two periods of his life: after his arrests for each of the sexual assaults against his nieces. Id. at 638-39, 664, 716-17. Consistent with Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s opinion, the records showed that Bardo had never been treated with psychotropic medication until after his arrest for the first sexual assault of one of his nieces, and then he was similarly treated for a time after his incarceration for the current offenses. Id. at 622-23, 658. Dr. O\u2019Brien also rejected the diagnosis of dysthymic disorder, which, he explained, is a chronic depression in which the affected individual has \u201ca chronically depressed mood that occurs most of the day, more days than not, for at least two years,\u201d and experiences \u201cclinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational ... or other important areas of functioning.\u201d Id. at 657, 659. Dr. O\u2019Brien found no evidence that Bardo exhibited any such clinically significant distress or impairment in the two years prior to the offenses, which was the most stable and quiet period of Bardo\u2019s life, when he was continuously employed full time, functioning, not hospitalized, and undergoing counseling related to his prior offense; furthermore, although he was continuing to use alcohol socially, there was no evidence that it was impairing his ability to function or was escalating. Id. at 659-60; 614-15, 625, 642, 649.\nWith regard to PTSD, Dr. O\u2019Brien also had a very different opinion than Dr. Berger. Dr. O\u2019Brien did not find any symptoms of PTSD attributable to Bardo\u2019s sexual abuse as a teenager; furthermore, he discerned no evidence of any symptoms of PTSD prior to Bardo\u2019s arrest for the current offense, a conclusion entirely consistent with the record. Id. at 609-12, 643, 650, 653-57. The only PTSD symptom that Dr. O\u2019Brien detected in Bardo was avoidance, ie., attempts to distract himself, to keep busy, to not think about the current offenses and his resulting circumstances. Id. at 611, 652, 702. It is important to emphasize that Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s observation of Bardo\u2019s avoidance was related to the current offense, and not, as Dr. Berger had opined, to his teenage sexual abuse. Consistent with his view of Bardo\u2019s avoidance behavior, Dr. O\u2019Brien opined that the current offense was \u201cthe most traumatic thing [Bardo] has experienced,\u201d causing him a great deal of emotional and traumatic upset. Id. at 611, 622-23, 643, 650. Nonetheless, Dr. O\u2019Brien concluded that Bardo\u2019s sole symptom of avoidance was not sufficient to warrant a PTSD diagnosis. Id. at 611, 643.\nBased on his review of the record, his evaluation of Bardo in 2009, Bardo\u2019s lack of need for psychiatric treatment for the preceding fourteen years, as well as the facts of the case, Dr. O\u2019Brien also concluded that Bardo was not suffering from an extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the offenses. Id. at 714. Thus, the testimony of Dr. O\u2019Brien, whom the PCRA court found credible, see PCRA Court Opinion at 34, serves as a strong counterbalance to Dr. Berger\u2019s opinion of Bardo\u2019s psychiatric history and diagnoses, and their manifestation at the time of the offenses. All of the above considerations must enter into the re-weighing on collateral review of the totality of the mitigating and aggravating factors in this case. After careful review and consideration of Dr. Berger\u2019s testimony and the above-summarized records on which he relied, we would conclude that Dr. Berger\u2019s testimony did not support a finding that Bardo\u2019s psychiatric problems were manifest at the time of his offenses, such as would have led to an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. 9711(e)(2); thus, we cannot conclude that any reasonable juror would have found this statutory mitigator, much less assigned determinative weight to it. We acknowledge that it is reasonably probable that one or more jurors may have found that Bardo\u2019s psychiatric history and diagnoses constituted a mitigating factor pursuant to the catch-all mitigator, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8). However, upon reweighing the mitigating and aggravating circumstances in light of Dr. Berger\u2019s PCRA testimony as to Bardo\u2019s psychiatric history and diagnoses, we would not conclude that the additional evidence of mitigation would have caused any reasonable juror to conclude that the mitigating factors balanced or outweighed the aggravating circumstances. Again, we view the aggravating factors in this case as particularly egregious: the murder of a three-year-old child by strangulation, involving forceful pressure to and deliberate compression of her neck over a period of approximately four to five minutes until after she lost consciousness, while perpetrating an indecent assault of the child that caused a four-millimeter tear to her vagina, pain, and bleeding. N.T. Guilt Phase, 1/26/93, at 368-92 (supporting aggravating factors 42 Pa.C.S. 9711(d)(6) and (d)(16)). See Gibson II, 19 A.3d at 531 (citing Commonwealth v. Lesko, 609 Pa. 128, 15 A.3d 345, 383-84 (2011), for proposition that \u201cwhere there is substantial aggravation, it may be particularly difficult to prove Strickland prejudice based on additional mitigation submitted at the post-conviction stage\u201d).\nWe recognize that, in formulating his opinion concerning the mitigating circumstances relevant to Bardo\u2019s offense, Dr. Berger relied on the totality of his psychiatric diagnoses of Bardo, including his diagnoses not only of depression and symptoms of PTSD, but also of alcohol abuse and dependence, as well as his consideration of Bardo\u2019s childhood home environment and social background. See N.T. Penalty Phase, 11/13/09, at 549 (Dr. Berger testified that the basis of his opinion that Bardo suffered from an extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the offenses was \u201cthe record review that I had indicating the previous mental health history and also the information contained [sic] from Mr. Bardo directly\u201d). Our analysis above has addressed these diagnoses and factors separately. However, we have also considered their import collectively, and, for all the reasons explained above, we would reach the same conclusions.\nWe also recognize that additional testimony concerning Bardo\u2019s psychiatric history and diagnoses was presented at the PCRA hearing by Dr. Blumberg. Of course, Bardo is not entitled to relief merely because PCRA counsel proffered the testimony of a different psychiatrist, who reached overlapping but distinct conclusions and diagnoses from those of the psychiatrist consulted by trial counsel. Nothing in the law at the time of trial in 1992, or at present, suggests that trial counsel is ineffective merely because he or she did not consult with and present the testimony of several mental health professionals with overlapping but not entirely consistent opinions.\nFurthermore, after carefully reviewing Dr. Blumberg\u2019s testimony, we would conclude that it was, in total, no more helpful in mitigation than Dr. Berger\u2019s testimony, and the disagreements between them with regard to particular diagnoses and applicable statutory mitigating factors tend to vitiate the import of both. In sum, Dr. Blumberg summarized largely the same points as did Dr. Berger from the records of Bardo\u2019s childhood, home environment, social history, and previous psychiatric interventions and diagnoses. Based on his review of the records and on his evaluation of Bardo in 2008, Dr. Blumberg suggested several diagnoses, which overlapped with, but in some instances were distinct from, those suggested by Dr. Berger.\nFor example, Dr. Blumberg concluded, in contrast to Dr. Berger, that Bardo did not suffer from major depression at the time of the current offenses. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 18-19, 161; Blumberg Affidavit at \u00b6 36. Dr. Berger acknowledged that \u201c[w]e have a difference of opinion, absolutely,\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 567, but there was no exploration of the possible reasons for the difference. Notably, the PCRA court erroneously found that both Dr. Blumberg and Dr. Berger diagnosed Bardo with major depression. PCRA Court Opinion at 32 n. 20. Dr. Blumberg also opined that Bardo was intoxicated at the time of the offenses, an opinion that Dr. Berger did not appear to share, or at least was more equivocal about. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 18-19, 40, 94-96, 108-09, 144-45; id. at 11/13/09, at 528, 538-39. Such differences of opinion would not likely enhance the case for mitigation, but rather could diminish the import of both psychiatrists\u2019 testimony.\nTurning to Dr. Blumberg\u2019s opinion that, at the time of the offenses, Bardo suffered from chronic PTSD, id. at 18-19, we have already discussed the numerous questions surrounding Dr. Berger rendering a similar opinion. Dr. Blumberg\u2019s testimony contributes little to the resolution of these questions. To support his PTSD diagnosis, Dr. Blumberg, like Dr. Berger, relied on Bardo\u2019s self-reports that he had suffered sexual abuse as a teenager, as well as on Bardo\u2019s self-reports of his symptoms. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 20, 73-88. However, undermining his own reliance on Bardo\u2019s self-reports, Dr. Blumberg repeatedly emphasized the importance of documenting an individual\u2019s self-reports in order to ensure their accuracy. Id. at 15 (\u201c[I]t is essential to have other documentation about the individual so that you could either confirm or refute what they [sic] are reporting to you\u201d and \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t want to rely just on what a Defendant is telling me because it may or may not be accurate.\u201d); id. at 21 (\u201c[I]t is essential to try to have other sources of data that can either confirm or refute what a Defendant tells you about their [sic] background, their [sic] growing-up experiences.\u201d). On cross-examination, Dr. Blumberg acknowledged that Bardo had told him that the symptoms he had experienced from his sexual abuse as a teenager had \u201cfaded\u201d after three to four years, i.e., when he was nineteen or twenty years of age, which was three years prior to the current offenses. Id. at 158-59. It is not clear if Dr. Blumberg accepted or rejected this self-report, but, in any event, the severity of any symptoms of PTSD that Bardo may have experienced at the time of the current offenses, as evaluated seventeen years later, is impossible to assess from the records and remains unclear from Dr. Blumberg\u2019s testimony.\nIn addition, Dr. Blumberg listed a series of eight traumatic events, all self-reported by Bardo, that may have served as triggering events for PTSD. Id. at 88, 152-53. Dr. Blumberg opined that the most serious event was Bardo\u2019s teenage sexual abuse, but suggested further that other events could also have served as triggers, including physical abuse within the family, an auto accident, an accident at work or home, threats of injury or injury at the hands of another, and some other experience causing serious injury or fear of serious injury or death. Id. at 88, 152-53. Apparently, when Dr. Blumberg provided him with a diagnostic self-reporting questionnaire, Bardo claimed to have experienced all the types of traumatic events listed. Id. at 152-54. While Dr. Blumberg testified that an individual is more likely to develop PTSD when exposed to more types of different traumatic events, id. at 88, he acknowledged that he had not asked specific questions about most of the incidents Bardo reported as traumatic; hence, the timing and severity of most of Bardo\u2019s self-reported traumatic events were unexplored. Id. at 154. Dr. O\u2019Brien challenged Dr. Blumberg\u2019s use of the self-reporting questionnaire, as well as his conclusions regarding Bardo\u2019s PTSD symptoms and stressors: \u201cI think that the diagnostic criteria [for PTSD] require[ ] a certain amount of specificity in terms of identifying, not only what the symptoms are with specificity, but [also that] they\u2019re linked to the alleged trauma, the reported trauma[,] and also the trauma has to be of a certain severity. It\u2019s not just any trauma.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 652. Thus, for all these reasons, Dr. Blumberg\u2019s opinions regarding a PTSD diagnosis had no greater mitigation value than the similar opinions of Dr. Berger.\nDr. Blumberg also diagnosed Bardo with personality disorder NOS, with schizoid, depressive, and inadequate features, with schizoid meaning emotionally withdrawn, and depressive indicating chronic feelings of inadequacy and proneness to become quite depressed. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 70. Dr. Blumberg explained that the personality disorder diagnosis \u201cis trying to make reference to his impaired thinking, his impaired interpersonal relationships, his impaired social functioning that is characterized primarily by his being a loner, by his being inadequate, by [h]is being chronically depressed and essentially an inept individual.\u201d Id. at 167. Dr. Blumberg further explained that the personality disorder diagnosis \u201calso impacts on [Bardo\u2019s] impulse control and his ability to think before acting on things. Basically his inability to tolerate stressful events [sic].\u201d Id. at 70. While these characteristics certainly suggested a maladjusted individual, it is far from clear how their manifestation at the time of the offenses could constitute supporting evidence for the statutory mitigators at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(2) or \u00a7 (e)(3), i.e., that, at the time of the offenses Bardo was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, or was substantially impaired in his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. See discussion infra.\nIn addition, Dr. Blumberg clarified that the personality disorder diagnosis overlaps with most of Bardo\u2019s other diagnoses. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 168; see also id. at 65-66 (Dr. Blumberg testifying that dysthymic disorder is \u201cassociated with characterological depression,\u201d which means that individuals with this condition \u201chave persistently impaired self-esteem ... feel badly about themselves ... feel inadequate ... feel hopeless ... feel like life is basically horrible[,] and [ ] these thoughts and feelings have persisted ... from early on and it becomes sort of a part of their character makeup\u201d); id. at 160-61. Dr. O\u2019Brien expanded on the overlap of diagnoses, opining that Dr. Blumberg\u2019s diagnosis of dysthymic disorder was \u201ca redundancy\u201d to his diagnosis of personality disorder NOS with depressive features; Dr. O\u2019Brien saw no reason to offer multiple different diagnoses of the same symptom. Id., 11/13/09, at 665. Given Dr. Blumberg\u2019s description of Bardo\u2019s personality disorder NOS, his failure to link it to the statutory mitigators at Sections 9711(e)(2) or (e)(3), his acknowledgment of overlap with Bar-do\u2019s various other diagnoses, Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony, and Dr. Berger\u2019s failure to render a diagnosis of personality disorder, we cannot conclude that Dr. Blumberg\u2019s diagnosis of personality disorder NOS would have had a significant additional mitigating impact had it been presented to the jury.\nDr. Blumberg also diagnosed Bardo with pedophilia. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 18-19, 82-85, 161-66. However, trial counsel testified that \u201c[pedophilia] is a word that I would never want introduced in this trial,\u201d as counsel did not \u201csee how showing Mike Bardo was a pedophile is going to [ ] help him.\u201d Id., 11/12/09, at 413-14. Trial counsel also testified to his concern that introducing the diagnosis of pedophilia would open the door to admission of Bardo\u2019s prior molestation of another three-year-old niece. Id. at 414-15. We cannot conclude that counsel\u2019s view was unreasonable. See Commonwealth v. Edmiston, 578 Pa. 284, 851 A.2d 883, 892-93 (2004) (counsel not ineffective for making tactical decision against presenting psychiatric expert testimony that defendant was a pedophile, based on counsel\u2019s fear that jury would tend to regard pedophilia as more of an aggravating factor than a mitigating one).\nFinally, Dr. Blumberg opined that the combination of Bar-do\u2019s mental disorders supported the applicability of two statutory mitigating factors: extreme mental or emotional disturbance, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(2); and substantial impairment in the capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, id. \u00a7 9711(e)(3). N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 19, 91-98. However, on cross-examination, Dr. Blumberg acknowledged that Bardo\u2019s actions just prior to and at the time of the murder showed that Bardo \u201crecognized that he was doing or engaging in some inappropriate conduct,\u201d and that Bardo had \u201ca basic appreciation of what he was doing;\u201d nonetheless, Dr. Blumberg opined that such recognition and appreciation were consistent with substantial impairment at the time of the offense. Id. at 173-74; see also id. at 175-81. The PCRA court tried to clarify the question of degree of impairment with the following general query to Dr. Blumberg: \u201cFrom [sic] someone who is, let\u2019s say a lay person, what is the difference [between] being impaired [and being] substantial[l]y impaired]?\u201d Dr. Blumberg responded that the degree of impairment could not be determined via an objective scale, but rather was a professional opinion or judgment call, rendered by an expert based on knowledge, training, and experience. Id. at 194-95.\nUltimately, of course, it is a jury\u2019s responsibility to assess the credibility of an expert\u2019s opinion and to determine whether the evidence supports the applicability of any statutory mitigating factors. Here, we do not believe that the jury\u2019s inclination to find one or more statutory mitigators would have been strengthened by Dr. Blumberg\u2019s various summary statements concerning Bardo\u2019s mental status and the manifestation of his combined psychiatric diagnoses. Indeed, Dr. Blumberg\u2019s statements in some instances contradict his ultimate opinion that Bardo was substantially impaired at the time of the offenses in his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. For example, Dr. Blumberg stated:\n[Bardo] feels inadequate, he feels inept, he feels likely to be rejected by a same-age partner, and not only felt sexually aroused but I think psychologically more comfortable with someone who is much younger, much more dependent, much less likely to reject him or his attention.\nN.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 84. The doctor added:\nThat [Bardo\u2019s] chronic depression, again, is something that underlined his whole sense of self, feeling inadequate, helpless, depressed, as if a failure in his life, and that has been a chronic and significant impediment throughout his life.\nAnd then you have also the underlying personality disturbance in which through all of the abuse and neglect of growing up impacted on [Bardo\u2019s] sense of self, interacted on his thinking about himself and the world, his emotions, his chronic depression, his inability to develop a long-term stable relationship with another adult. And apparently the only way that he would have an interaction with somebody would be with somebody who was much younger, much more helpless, much more vulnerable to whom he found himself very sexually attracted.\n[Bardo] has extremely impaired self-esteem. He goes through periods of depressed mood when he thinks about his past, his background, and he numbs himself with alcohol, which further impairs his functioning. He has difficulty maintaining relationships with other people.\nHe is kind of a loner, inept, anticipates the world is a rejecting place. He is a chronically depressed and inadequate guy and, you know, his life is \u2014 he has not held any great jobs. He\u2019s done poorly in school. He essentially failed at most everything that he has attempted and, you know, then he even gets drunk and molests his niece.\n[The features of personality disorder NOS] were consistent with [Bardo] being basically immature, inept, inadequate, a loner....\n[The diagnosis of personality disorder NOS] is trying to make reference to [Bardo\u2019s] impaired thinking, his impaired interpersonal relationships, his impaired social functioning that is characterized primarily by his being a loner, by his being inadequate, by his being chronically depressed and essentially an inept individual.\nId. at 95-96,160-61, 166-67.\nThese observations, that Bardo was a generally depressed, inept, immature loner who had often failed, felt inadequate, had low self-esteem, and was unable to sustain adult relationships do not constitute evidence that, at the time of the offenses, he was substantially impaired in the ability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(3), or was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, id. \u00a7 9711(e)(2). Likewise, Dr. Blumberg\u2019s view that Bardo felt \u201cmore comfortable\u201d and would only have an \u201cinteraction\u201d with someone who was much younger, dependent, helpless, vulnerable, and unlikely to reject his attention, and to whom he was sexually attracted, does not constitute evidence supporting these statutory mitigators. Furthermore, we agree with the Commonwealth that this evidence might well have been perceived by the jury as more prejudicial than mitigating. See Commonwealth Brief at 56.\nHaving reviewed the entirety of Dr. Blumberg\u2019s PCRA testimony, we believe it is highly unlikely that any juror would have found either the Section 9711(e)(2) or the Section 9711(e)(8) statutory mitigator, and, in our view, the PCRA court erred in finding otherwise. Our conclusion is based on the facts of this case, Dr. Blumberg\u2019s acknowledgment that Bardo had a basic appreciation of what he was doing at the time of the offenses, Dr. Blumberg\u2019s statements concerning Bardo\u2019s mental status and personality characteristics, and the lack of any evidence upon which to ground a finding that his mental status at the time of the offenses supported the applicability of either the \u00a7 9711(e)(2) or \u00a7 9711(e)(3) statutory mitigators. However, as with Dr. Berger\u2019s testimony, Dr. Blumberg\u2019s testimony was reasonably likely to have caused one or more jurors to find that Bardo\u2019s psychiatric history and diagnoses constituted mitigating circumstances under the catchall mitigator of Section 9711(e)(8). Nevertheless, upon re-weighing the mitigating and aggravating factors, we would not conclude that any additional evidence of mitigation discerned in Dr. Blumberg\u2019s PCRA testimony would have caused any reasonable juror to conclude that the mitigating factors balanced or outweighed the egregious aggravating factors in this case.\nIn sum, based on our thorough review of the documents of record, the penalty phase hearing, and the PCRA hearing, we would reverse the PCRA court\u2019s order insofar as it granted Bardo a new penalty phase hearing. First, the PCRA court\u2019s findings were, in some important respects, not supported by the record. Furthermore, in our view, the PCRA court considered only the new evidence in mitigation before it at the collateral phase and did not re-weigh the totality of the evidence in mitigation against the egregious aggravating factors present in this case. Having corrected these errors, we would reverse the PCRA court\u2019s grant of a new penalty phase hearing.\nII. Bardo\u2019s Appeal (650 CAP)\nWe turn now to Bardo\u2019s appeal, where he raised the following issues:\nI. Whether the PCRA Court erred in denying Bardo\u2019s claim that he was denied due process, reliable sentencing and effective assistance of counsel under the federal and state constitutions because prejudicial pretrial publicity tainted the entire venire panel and counsel failed to pursue a change of venue on that basis.\nII. Whether the PCRA Court erred in denying Bardo\u2019s claim that he was denied due process, reliable sentencing and effective assistance of counsel under the federal and state constitutions by the erroneous admission of victim impact evidence.\nIII. Whether the PCRA Court erred in denying Bardo\u2019s claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel under the federal and state constitutions because counsel failed to adequately investigate a viable voluntary intoxication defense and, through expert testimony, present that defense at the guilt and penalty phases.\nIV. Whether the PCRA Court erred in denying Bardo\u2019s claim that he was denied due process, reliable sentencing and effective assistance of counsel under the federal and state constitutions because the Commonwealth violated its obligations under Brady v. Maryland by failing to disclose mitigating information about Bardo and his family that was contained in Luzerne County Children and Youth Services records and in failing to reach Bardo\u2019s claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because counsel failed to adequately seek and obtain such records.\nV. Whether the PCRA Court erred in denying Bardo\u2019s claim that he was denied due process, reliable sentencing and effective assistance of counsel under the federal and state constitutions because the trial court improperly incorporated guilt phase evidence into the penalty phase without objection by counsel.\nVI. Whether the PCRA Court erred in denying Bardo\u2019s claim that he was denied due process, reliable sentencing and effective assistance of counsel under the federal and state constitutions because the trial court gave erroneous instructions on the nature and use of mitigating evidence and failed to correct misleading closing arguments by the Commonwealth without objection by counsel.\nVII. Whether the PCRA Court erred in denying Bardo\u2019s claim that he was denied due process and effective assistance of counsel under the federal and state constitutions because of the cumulative effect of all errors.\nBardo\u2019s Brief at 2-3 (reordered for ease of disposition).\nIn his first claim, Bardo asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to seek a change of venue based on allegedly inflammatory and pervasive pretrial publicity about the facts of the case, including his confession and his history of child molestation. Bardo\u2019s Brief at 63. Bardo acknowledges that trial counsel did include a request for a change of venue in his omnibus pretrial motion, but maintains that counsel was ineffective because he withdrew the motion days later without obtaining a ruling from the trial court. Id. at 69. In response, the Commonwealth relies on the voir dire record to argue that none of the empanelled jurors had formed a fixed opinion as to Bardo\u2019s guilt or innocence and all had affirmed that they would base their decision solely on the evidence presented in the courtroom. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 34-35. The Commonwealth also cites the court\u2019s extensive instructions to the jury panel during voir dire. Id. at 35 (quoting N.T. Voir Dire at 8-9). Finally, the Commonwealth cites excerpts of the PCRA hearing in which lead trial counsel testified that the motion for a change of venue had been withdrawn without prejudice to be refiled if seating a jury in Luzerne County had proven impossible, and that the defense was satisfied with the process of voir dire and found it to be fair. Id. at 36-37 (citing N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/12/09, at 494-96).\nThe PCRA court denied Bardo\u2019s claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness for failing to file a second motion for change of venue, holding that Bardo had failed to establish the performance or prejudice prongs of the Strickland/Pierce standard. PCRA Court Opinion at 9-13. As the PCRA court noted, this Court reviewed the law applicable to requests to change of venue in Commonwealth v. Briggs, 608 Pa. 430, 12 A.3d 291 (2011).\nA change in venue is compelled whenever a trial court concludes a fair and impartial jury cannot be selected from the residents of the county where the crime occurred. As a general rule, for a defendant to be entitled to a change of venue because of pretrial publicity, he or she must show that the publicity caused actual prejudice by preventing the empanelling of an impartial jury. The mere existence of pretrial publicity alone, however, does not constitute actual prejudice. Simply because prospective jurors may have heard about a case through media reports does not render them incapable of jury service....\n[T]he pivotal question in determining whether an impartial jury may be selected is not whether prospective jurors have knowledge of the crime being tried, or have even formed an initial opinion based on the news coverage they had been exposed to, but, rather, whether it is possible for those jurors to set aside their impressions or preliminary opinions and render a verdict solely based on the evidence presented to them at trial.\nNevertheless, our Court has recognized that there are some instances in which pretrial publicity can be so pervasive and inflammatory a defendant does not have to prove actual prejudice. Prejudice will be presumed whenever a defendant demonstrates that the pretrial publicity: (1) was sensational, inflammatory, and slanted toward conviction, rather than factual and objective; (2) revealed the defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, if any, or referred to confessions, admissions or reenactments of the crime by the defendant; or (3) derived from official police or prosecutorial reports. However, if the defendant proves the existence of one or more of these circumstances, a change of venue will still not be compelled unless the defendant also demonstrates that the presumptively prejudicial pretrial publicity was so extensive, sustained, and pervasive that the community must be deemed to have been saturated with it, and that there was insufficient time between the publicity and the trial for any prejudice to have dissipated. With respect to the determination of whether there has been an adequate cooling off period to dissipate the effect of presumptively prejudicial media coverage ... [a] court must investigate what a panel of prospective jurors has said about its exposure to the publicity in question. This is one indication of whether the cooling period has been sufficient. Thus, in determining the efficacy of the cooling period, a court will consider the direct effects of publicity, something a defendant need not allege or prove.... Normally, what prospective jurors tell us about their ability to be impartial will be a reliable guide to whether the publicity is still so fresh in their minds that it has removed their ability to be objective. The discretion of the trial judge is given wide latitude in this area.\nId. at 313-14 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see id. at 313 (\u201ctrial court is in the best position to assess the atmosphere of the community and to judge the necessity of any requested change\u201d in venue, and therefore trial court\u2019s decision will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion) (citations omitted).\nHere, the PCRA court assumed that the pretrial media coverage of Bardo\u2019s offenses and his case could have fallen within the definition of \u201cpresumptively prejudicial\u201d set forth in Briggs. PCRA Court Opinion at 11. However, it concluded that the record did not show either that the presumptively prejudicial pretrial publicity was so extensive, sustained, and pervasive as to saturate the community or that the cooling off period had been insufficient. Id. (citing Briggs). Contrary to Bardo\u2019s assertions, the fact that nearly all of the venire members had heard something about his case did not establish media saturation of the community, and the fact that the trial commenced somewhat less than five months after the crime did not establish that the cooling off period was insufficient. Id. at 12. Accordingly, the PCRA court held that Bardo had failed to show that trial counsel was ineffective for not filing a second change of venue motion.\nIn addition, the PCRA court concluded that Bardo was not prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s decision not to file a second change of venue motion. The PCRA court explained its ruling as follows:\nThe media coverage was extensively addressed during voir dire, and any potential jurors indicating a fixed opinion as a result of media exposure were dismissed for cause. More importantly, each empanelled juror affirmed the absence of any fixed opinion as a result of media coverage and that such would render their decision based solely upon the evidence presented at trial, [deleting citation to numerous portions of the voir dire transcript]. [As set forth in the trial court\u2019s] post-verdict Opinion issued on November 10, 1994[,] ... a review of the record reveals no prejudicial error during voir dire. Counsel were given considerable latitude during the process, and [all jurors] who [were] accepted indicated they could and would give the defendant a fair and impartial trial, they had no fixed opinions, and they could and would decide the issues in this case based solely upon the evidence presented in the courtroom.... [T]he trial judge is in the best position to assess the prospective juror\u2019s potential bias and partiality, and the undersigned determined that each juror would be impartial. We also note that Bardo failed to exhaust his peremptory challenges and, therefore, could articulate no prejudice. Additionally, the jury was emphatically instructed [that its] decision was to be rendered \u201con the basis of the facts as they have been presented to you by the evidence, and on absolutely nothing else.\u201d N.T. Trial[, 1/27/93, at] 630-31. Pennsylvania law presumes the jury has followed the trial court\u2019s instructions. For these reasons, we conclude Bardo has failed to establish prejudice pursuant to the Strickland/Pierce test, and this claim is denied.\nId. at 12-13 (footnote added).\nThe PCRA court\u2019s findings and holding are supported by the record; accordingly, we will not disturb the court\u2019s denial of Bardo\u2019s first ineffectiveness claim.\nIn his second issue, Bardo claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when \u201c[t]he prosecution improperly injected victim impact considerations into the guilt and penalty phases of the trial by eliciting irrelevant evidence whose only purpose was to create sympathy for the victim\u2019s mother, Cathy Bardo.\u201d Bardo\u2019s Brief at 86. The evidence that Bardo challenges is the direct examination testimony of Ms. Bardo, which, he argues, was not relevant and \u201cwas tantamount to victim impact testimony.\u201d Id. at 87-88. Claiming constitutional error, apparently based on an alleged denial of due process, Bardo seeks a new trial. Id. at 86, 89. The challenged testimony, in its entirety, is as follows.\nProsecutor: What did you do the rest of that day [September 4, 1992, the day of the murder]?\nWitness: Looked for her [the victim].\nProsecutor: Where?\nWitness: I looked for [the victim].\nProsecutor: Where?\nDefense Counsel: Objection.\nCourt: Overruled.\nDefense Counsel: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s relevant.\nCourt: I\u2019ll allow it.\nWitness: All over. I went door to door, through Lee Park and through Wilkes-Barre there, just went calling for her. Prosecutor: You didn\u2019t find her?\nWitness: No.\nProsecutor: Can you tell the jury how you found out when [the victim] was found?\nWitness: The next morning I was coming \u2014 I was going back over to my mother\u2019s after looking for her all night. I stopped at a store for coffee and a pack of cigarettes. And some lady come walking in the door, yelling that they found that baby that was missing, they found her in the creek in a garbage bag.\nN.T. Trial, 1/25/93, at 112-13 (quoted in Bardo\u2019s Brief at 87).\nAlthough Bardo asserts \u2014 inaccurately\u2014that counsel failed to object to the above testimony, he subsequently acknowledges that counsel objected \u201cto part of Cathy Bardo\u2019s prejudicial testimony based on relevance grounds, but did not raise with the trial court the fact that her testimony was a de facto victim impact statement and did not object to all of the offending testimony.\u201d Bardo\u2019s Brief at 88. The Commonwealth argues, and the PCRA court held, that the challenged testimony did not constitute victim impact evidence, but rather was part of the full picture and chronology of the crime, and was properly admitted as such. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 48-49; PCRA Court Opinion at 16. Following review of the record, we conclude that the PCRA court did not err in rejecting this ineffectiveness claim.\nVictim impact evidence is \u201cdesigned to show each victim\u2019s uniqueness as a human being.\u201d Commonwealth v. Flor, 606 Pa. 384, 998 A.2d 606, 633 (2010) (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 823, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991)); see also id. (\u201c[Victim impact testimony conveys to the jury that the decedent was a unique individual whose loss affects society.\u201d) (citation omitted). Victim impact evidence encompasses information concerning the victim and the impact that the death of the victim has had on his or her family, which is not otherwise relevant to the proceeding. Id. at 634; Commonwealth v. Rios, 591 Pa. 583, 920 A.2d 790, 806-07 (2007). At the time of Bardo\u2019s trial, victim impact evidence was completely barred from criminal proceedings. Id. at 806.\nHowever, \u201ca criminal defendant does not have the right to have all evidence presented against him at trial sanitized of anything that could cause jurors to sympathize with the victim or [her] family.\u201d Id. at 807. Rather, the jury must be presented with a full picture of the offenses charged in order to aid in the jury\u2019s understanding of the development and nature of those offenses. Id.; Commonwealth v. Saranchak, 544 Pa. 158, 675 A.2d 268, 275 (1996). Furthermore, rulings on the admission of evidence are within the discretion of the trial court. Flor, 998 A.2d at 634.\nHere, we agree with the PCRA court that the challenged testimony \u201cis simply not victim impact evidence.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion at 15. The testimony did not concern the victim or the impact of the victim\u2019s death on her family, and thus counsel cannot be faulted for failing to object to it as victim impact evidence. Also, as the PCRA court explained, the testimony was \u201cpart of the chronology of the crime charged in this case.\u201d Id. The record supports this additional point. Just before the challenged portion of Ms. Bardo\u2019s testimony, she had testified that, when she learned that her daughter was missing, she had run to the nearby creek, crying and yelling her daughter\u2019s name. As she was running through the creek, Bardo had grabbed her shoulder, knocked her down, and told her to stop looking because she would not find her daughter there. N.T. Trial, 1/25/93, at 109-10. The victim\u2019s body was later found in that creek, and Ms. Bardo related how and when she had learned of that discovery. Id. at 111-13. Ms. Bardo\u2019s testimony provided the jury with an account of Bardo\u2019s actions toward her after the murder, and thus could help the jury to develop a more complete understanding of the offenses. We therefore agree with the PCRA court that there is no merit to Bardo\u2019s assertion that trial counsel was required to raise a victim impact objection to Ms. Bardo\u2019s testimony.\nIn his third claim, Bardo asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present a voluntary intoxication defense. Bardo asserts that trial counsel should have proffered expert testimony to establish that Bardo was legally intoxicated at the time of the offenses, and therefore his judgment and impulse control were impaired, suggesting that he was not able to form the specific intent to kill. Bardo\u2019s Brief at 51, 58. The Commonwealth maintains that there was no evidence whatsoever, and thus no basis for a finding, that, at the time of the offenses, Bardo was intoxicated to the point of losing his faculties and sensibilities, which is the relevant standard. Commonwealth\u2019s Second Brief at 11.\nAfter summarizing and analyzing the PCRA testimony of Bardo\u2019s two experts on the subject of voluntary intoxication, the PCRA court declined to grant relief. Bardo\u2019s experts estimated Bardo\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time of the offenses to have been .10% or .09%. The PCRA court noted that the testimony suggested that an individual with this blood alcohol level would \u201ctypically exhibit diminished judgment, inhibition, coordination, and reaction ... [and] would typically have diminished impulse control and a heightened need for immediate gratification.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion at 8-9 (summarizing N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09 at 212-13, and 11/10/09 at 287) (internal quotation marks omitted). Nevertheless, the PCRA court found that \u201cthe Trial Record and the PCRA Record are absolutely devoid of any evidence sufficient to establish Bardo was so overwhelmed or overpowered by alcohol to the point of losing his faculties as required to establish voluntary intoxication.\u201d Id. at 9 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, the PCRA court held that Bardo had \u201cutterly failed\u201d to establish ineffective assistance under the Strickland/Pierce test. PCRA Court Opinion at 9.\nThe PCRA court\u2019s ruling is supported by the record and is free of legal error. This Court has previously made clear that a defense of diminished capacity grounded in voluntary intoxication is a very limited defense, which does not exculpate the defendant from criminal liability, but, if successfully advanced, mitigates first-degree murder to third-degree murder. Commonwealth v. Hutchinson, 611 Pa. 280, 25 A.3d 277, 312 (2011). The mere fact of intoxication is not a defense; rather, the defendant must prove that his cognitive abilities of deliberation and premeditation were so compromised by voluntary intoxication that he was unable to formulate the specific intent to kill. Id. In other words, to prove a voluntary intoxication defense, the defendant must show that he was \u201coverwhelmed to the point of losing his faculties and sensibilities.\u201d Id. (quoting Commonwealth v. Blakeney, 596 Pa. 510, 946 A.2d 645, 653 (2008)). Evidence that the defendant lacked the ability to control his actions or acted impulsively is irrelevant to specific intent to kill, and thus does not constitute support of a voluntary intoxication defense. Id.\nAs the PCRA court determined, there was no evidence presented at trial or at the PCRA hearing that, at the time of his offenses, Bardo was overwhelmed by intoxication to the point of losing his faculties and sensibilities. Indeed, the evidence was uniformly to the contrary. One of Bardo\u2019s own expert witnesses, Dr. Blumberg, testified at the PCRA hearing that, at the time of the offenses, Bardo \u201cdid not reach the point where he was so impaired that he couldn\u2019t formulate an intent to engage in this activity.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 93-94; see also id. at 182 (opining that Bardo\u2019s alcohol consumption on the night of the offenses \u201cdid disinhibit him and impair[ed] his behavioral controls\u201d). Another of Bardo\u2019s experts, Dr. Lage, a pharmacologist and toxicologist, opined that with a blood alcohol level of .10%, which was his estimate of Bardo\u2019s blood alcohol level at the time of the offenses, an individual would have impaired judgment and a loss \u201cto some extent\u201d of inhibitions. Id. at 213. Thus, the testimony of Bardo\u2019s own experts did not establish that, at the time of the offenses, Bardo was unable to formulate the specific intent to kill because he was overwhelmed to the point of losing his faculties and sensibilities by voluntary ingestion of alcohol. The PCRA court\u2019s rejection on the merits of Bardo\u2019s claim of counsel ineffectiveness for not pursuing a defense of voluntary intoxication is supported by the record; accordingly, the Court will not disturb it.\nBardo\u2019s fourth, fifth and sixth issues all involve claims limited to the penalty phase of his initial trial. Given that the PCRA court\u2019s grant of penalty phase relief premised upon counsel ineffectiveness relating to the initial sentencing proceeding is affirmed by operation of law, due to this Court\u2019s 3-3 deadlock, we need not, and do not, pass upon these additional sentencing claims.\nFinally, in his seventh and last issue, which comprises four sentences, Bardo asserts that the cumulative effect of all the alleged errors constituted a denial of due process, entitling him to a new trial. Bardo\u2019s Brief at 90. As we have previously held, no number of claims that have been denied because of lack of merit can collectively warrant relief. Commonwealth v. Spotz, 616 Pa. 164, 47 A.3d 63, 129 (2012). As Bardo has not established that any of the guilt phase claims in his appeal are meritorious, he is not entitled to relief.\nIII. Conclusion\nThe grant of penalty phase relief, at issue in the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal at No. 651 CAP, is affirmed by operation of law, the Court being evenly divided.

The opinion of the PCRA court, in setting forth the background of the case, neglected to note that at least one juror found alcohol abuse as a mitigating factor. See PCRA Court Opinion, filed 1/3/12, at 17.\n. It is not clear from the record why the appointment of new counsel was delayed for many years.\n. The direct appeal in this case was decided in 1998, well before our decision in Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726 (2002), which held that claims of ineffectiveness of trial counsel should be deferred until collateral review. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hanible, 612 Pa. 183, 30 A.3d 426, 439 (2011). The record reveals that Bardo was represented by the Luzerne County Public Defender\u2019s Office at trial and on direct appeal. Accordingly, his PCRA petition was the first opportunity for him to raise claims of counsel ineffectiveness.\n. Recently, in Commonwealth v. Tharp, 627 Pa. 673, 101 A.3d 736, 773 n. 28 (2014), this Court rejected a prior approach that Strickland prejudice could not be established merely by showing on post-conviction review that trial counsel had failed to present additional evidence supporting a mitigating factor that was found by the sentencing jury. See id. at 776 (Castille, C.J., concurring, joined by Eakin, J.) (noting that four concurring Justices favor overruling Commonwealth v. Marshall, 571 Pa. 289, 812 A.2d 539 (2002), and Commonwealth v. Rios, 591 Pa. 583, 920 A.2d 790 (2007), to extent that those cases required proof of an additional mitigating factor to establish prejudice); see also id. at 777-78 (Saylor, J., concurring, joined by Todd, J., and Eakin, J., concurring).\n. The PCRA court did not draw conclusions specifically with regard to the value in mitigation of these alcohol-related factors. Thus, the weight that the PCRA court applied to expert testimony addressing Bardo's alleged alcohol abuse, intoxication, and dependence is unclear. For the reasons discussed in the text, infra, we would conclude that, to the extent the PCRA court relied on the mitigation value of these alcohol-related factors to award a new penalty phase hearing, the court erred.\n. Dr. Blumberg testified that his diagnosis of alcohol intoxication on the night of the offenses was \"based a lot\u201d on Bardo\u2019s self-reported drinking prior to the offenses, as well as the police report and the affidavit of Dr. Lage. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 40.\n. Accord Commonwealth v. Crawley, 541 Pa. 408, 663 A.2d 676, 680 n. 8 (1995) (concluding that counsel could reasonably conclude that evidence of appellant\u2019s illicit drug use would have served only to further inflame jurors against appellant).\n. Mr. Delaney made an error in his estimate of Bardo\u2019s blood alcohol level in the 1993 report he provided to trial counsel. Based on an erroneous estimate of the volume of beer that Bardo drank in the hours before the offenses, Mr. Delaney had estimated that Bardo\u2019s blood alcohol level was .03%. When the error was realized, apparently at some point in the PCRA process, Mr. Delaney upwardly revised his estimate of Bardo\u2019s blood alcohol level to .09%. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/10/09, at 278-88. Mr. Delaney's error is not chargeable to trial counsel, of course; and, in any event, for the reasons discussed in the text, we would conclude that Bardo was not prejudiced.\n. Section 9711(e)(8) is the only mitigator to which the allegations of Bardo's alcohol dependence could conceivably be relevant.\n. Mr. Delaney, the psychologist retained by Bardo before trial, did not mention any mental health diagnoses other than alcohol abuse and did not opine that any statutory mitigators were applicable in his PCRA testimony, in his affidavit prepared at the request of PCRA counsel, or in his 1993 report to trial counsel. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/10/09, at 256-319; Affidavit/Declaration of Ned Delaney Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746 and 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4904, undated, but prepared for PCRA purposes (\"Affidavit/Declaration of Mr. Delaney\u201d) (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 32); Psychological Evaluation of Michael Bardo by Ned Delaney, dated 1/27/93 (\"1993 Psychological Evaluation\u201d) (Petitioner\u2019s Exhibit 30).\n. In Bardo's Appendix to his Brief, he indicates that the date of this Case Record was April 3, 1972. This is incorrect. As is clear from the document itself, April 3, 1972, was the date that Bardo began attendance at the day-care home. The caseworker prepared the document on July 20, 1972, after she had visited the day-care home several times.\n. Neither document indicates the nature of the offenses for which Bardo was under supervision.\n. As the Commonwealth notes, Dr. Berger acknowledged at the PCRA hearing that he had erroneously believed that Bardo had first disclosed his sexual victimization in a prior report from LCCYS. Commonwealth's Brief at 47 (citing N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 561-63). When PCRA counsel acknowledged that there was no such prior report, Dr. Berger stated that Bardo\u2019s delayed report of abuse was an important fact to note in assessing its credibility. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 563.\n. See also Defendant\u2019s Omnibus Pre-Trial Motion at 7-8 \u00b6\u00b6 22-24 (seeking to bar the Commonwealth from using Bardo\u2019s prior conviction for statutory rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, and corruption of minors as evidence).\n. Mr. Delaney also listed a series of \u201ccharacterological personality traits which support the diagnosis [of alcohol abuse],\u201d including average range of intelligence; a tendency \"to over simplify information fields perceived as complex or ambiguous;\u201d restricted ability to appreciate other points of view; poorly developed problem solving skills; negative self-esteem; a tendency to dislike himself, evolving into feelings of inferiority and/or inadequacy; a lack of mature social skills; difficulty establishing and maintaining deep and intimate relationships; a guarded, constrained, and withdrawn manner; difficulty dealing with his sexuality; a tendency to act on his impulses; evasion of responsibilities; and difficulty delaying gratification and sustaining goal directed behaviors. 1993 Psychological Evaluation at 2; see also N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/10/09, at 277 (listing same traits).\n\"Characterological personality traits\u201d are not psychiatric diagnoses, and they were not presented as such. Furthermore, personality traits such as impulsiveness, evasion of responsibilities, and difficulty with delayed gratification would not necessarily be interpreted by a jury in a manner favorable to the defendant. For example, as we have previously noted, a jury might very well find that impulsiveness is an unfavorable indication of an accused\u2019s future dangerousness. See Commonwealth v. Howard, 553 Pa. 266, 719 A.2d 233, 238 & n. 5 (1998).\n. Second chair counsel testified that, in a pre-trial phone conversation, Dr. Berger told him that Bardo was not insane and was competent, but had some sort of anti-social personality disorder. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/12/09, at 378-79.\n. Dr. Berger did not suggest that the evidence satisfied any other statutory mitigators.\n. All three psychiatrist-experts gave a similar definition of dysthymic disorder. As defined by Dr. Berger, dysthymic disorder is \"a low-grade chronic depression. It\u2019s almost a personality characteristic. I like to describe them \u2014 essentially, the people who are just that chronic negative depressed [sic].\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/13/09, at 547.\nDr. Blumberg defined dysthymic disorder as a chronic, persistent depressive disorder of mild to moderate severity. Id., 11/9/09, at 60. Individuals with this disorder exhibit depressed mood, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, and \"the physical or vegetative symptoms of depression,\u201d as well as \"characterological depression,\" which means that they have impaired self-esteem, feel badly about themselves, feel inadequate and hopeless, and consider life to be \"basically horrible.\u201d Id. at 65-66.\nDr. O'Brien similarly defined dysthymic disorder as \"a chronic sub-clinical depression ... [that is] less severe, but [is] chronic, people who are just down all of the time.\u201d Id., 11/13/09, at 657. He described individuals who suffer from dysthymic disorder as follows: \"It\u2019s a glass very half empty type of person. They\u2019re always bummed out. They\u2019re always negative. There\u2019s chronic depressive quality to them.\u201d Id. at 717.\n. The PCRA court did not make an assessment of Dr. Berger's credibility.\n. Trial counsel\u2019s conduct must be viewed in light of governing law in 1992. Current Pennsylvania standards with respect to counsel\u2019s duty to develop mitigating evidence are more exacting than in 1992, but counsel\u2019s effectiveness should not be measured by subsequently developed standards. See, e.g., Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 196-97, 131 S.Ct. 1388, 1407, 179 L.Ed.2d 557 (2011); Bobby v. Van Hook, 558 U.S. 4, 130 S.Ct. 13, 175 L.Ed.2d 255 (2009). In this case, the evolution of the standards for counsel\u2019s performance does not seem to be of determinative significance. The PCRA court credited counsel\u2019s testimony that he had no strategic reason for not pursuing Dr. Berger\u2019s pre-trial determination that he might be able to assist in the penalty phase. The focus in this appeal is on whether Bardo was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to follow-up with Dr. Berger regarding his potential mitigation testimony.\n. Although Dr. Blumberg testified that there were records indicating that Bardo was sexually abused as a child, see N.T. PCRA Hearing, 11/9/09, at 20, those records are Bardo\u2019s self-reports of abuse made shortly after he was arrested for the sexual assault of his niece in 1988.\n. In Commonwealth v. Martin, 607 Pa. 165, 5 A.3d 177 (2010), a case with some similarities to this case, the Court affirmed the PCRA court's grant of a new penalty phase hearing based on trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in failing to investigate and present mitigating evidence that Martin had been diagnosed with mental illnesses that affected him before, during, and after he murdered a homosexual male who had made sexual advances to him.\nDuring the penalty phase, Martin\u2019s mother testified that he had started using drugs at an early age; had been sexually abused by an uncle who was later convicted of the molestations; and had undergone psychiatric treatment during several periods of his life. Trial counsel did not present the testimony of, or even consult with, any mental health experts as to potential mental health mitigation evidence. The jury found no mitigating circumstances and three aggravating circumstances, and accordingly, determined that Martin should be sentenced to death. Id. at 197-98.\nAt the PCRA hearing, Martin presented the testimony of two mental health experts who had treated him for years prior to the murder, and he presented his mental health records. This evidence established that, from age fifteen until after the murder, which he committed at age twenty-one, Martin suffered from PTSD and depression, due to repeated sexual molestations by his uncle. A third mental health expert, who evaluated Martin after the murder, opined that due to Martin's PTSD and depression which, importantly, had resulted from his prior sexual abuse, the male victim\u2019s sexual advances immediately prior to the murder had placed Martin under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, thus supporting the statutory mitigator at 42 Pa.C.S. 9711(e)(2). This expert further opined that the Section 9711(e)(3) statutory mitigator was also applicable for the same reasons. 5 A.3d at 198-99.\nAffirming the PCRA court\u2019s grant of a new penalty phase hearing, the Court held that the PCRA court's factual determinations were supported by the record and that the PCRA court had correctly concluded that Martin was prejudiced as a matter of law. Id. at 203-04. As we have reiterated in that case, each capital case challenging trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness for failing to present sufficient mitigation evidence must be analyzed considering the facts presented, including the defendant's unique life history. Id. at 196. While Martin and the instant case have some superficial factual similarities, we believe there are sufficient material distinctions to warrant a different outcome.\n25. The Honorable Patrick J. Toole presided over both Bardo\u2019s trial and his PCRA hearing.\n. In this issue, Bardo also asserts claims of prosecutorial misconduct and trial court error, but these iterations are waived as they could have been raised at trial or on direct appeal and were not. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b).\n. Prior to amendment of the Pennsylvania Sentencing Code in 1995, victim impact evidence was deemed inadmissible at any stage of a capital trial. On October 11, 1995, the General Assembly amended the Sentencing Code to permit the admission of victim impact evidence during the penalty phase. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(a)(2). See also Commonwealth v. Means, 565 Pa. 309, 773 A.2d 143, 147-53 (2001) (Opinion Announcing Judgment of Court) (describing background and history). As Bardo\u2019s trial took place in 1993, no victim impact evidence was permitted, either in the guilt or penalty phase."}
