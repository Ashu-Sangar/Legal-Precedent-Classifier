{"id": "868546", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nAlthough the testator\u2019s direction that his daughter\u2019s portion of bis estate should be held on a separate use trust, might seem on his literal wording of it, to depend on a contingency, yet his plain intent to the contrary appears from a view of his whole will together. He directs his real estate to be held \u201c as at present, undivided, and unapportioned \u201d during the life of his widow, and the interest of each child during that time is only in a share of the \u201c net residue \u201d of the income, after payment of taxes, necessary repairs, etc. This arrangement, \u201cas the testator calls it, is to continue during the life of his widow, and at her decease his \u201c children shall do as they think best,\u201d i. e. as to a continuance of the arrangement, but should they \u201c agree to a division of the estate \u201d then the separate portions of the daughters \u201c shall be separately secured to them and their use beyond the dictation of the husband of either of them.\u201d The purpose to create a separate use is thus clear, and where that is so, no particular form of words is necessary. The fact that it is directed on the happening of the contingency of the widow\u2019s death and the refusal of the children to continue the joint arrangement, is no more than a direction to put the trust into form when it may become necessary. So long as the estate was held together on the trust to collect and distribute the revenue a formal separate use was not necessary, the daughters got only their shares of net income without it, but when the estate was to be divided so that the daughters\u2019 shares should come to them in severalty, freed from the first administrative trust, then the separate use would be required and was directed to be made. The contingency specified by the testator did not go to the creation of the separate use but to the time and occasion for putting it into formal execution.\nThe claim that the widow took a fee in one third of the realty cannot be sustained. The whole estate is left in an active trust to keep it together, collect rents, make repairs, pay incumbrances, etc., \u201c as though I myself acted in the premises,\u201d and the widow was to get one third of the residue, that is, of the net income. Not only is this all that is given in terms to the widow, but the direction that after her death the joint administration of the whole may be continued by the children, or in case they determine to make partition, the daughters\u2019 portions shall be put in separate use trust, shows that it is all the testator intended to give.\nDecree affirmed."}
