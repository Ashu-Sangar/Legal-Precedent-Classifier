{"id": "1044476", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe refusal to grant or continue a preliminary injunction is error only when the right threatened with invasion is an unquestionable one, and the only protection from irreparable injury to it is to be found in a court of equity: Crawford v. Sullivan, 238 Pa. 142. In view of this rule the court below did not err in refusing to continue the injunction, and its decree dissolving the same is affirmed, at appellants\u2019 costs."}
