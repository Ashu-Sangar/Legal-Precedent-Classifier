{"id": "1063493", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn this case, which was heard on bill, answer and proofs, the court below sustained the following findings of fact.\nDefendant, Annie Baron, on December 26, 1918, was, and now is, the owner of certain real estate in the City of \u2022 Philadelphia; that day, she and her husband, J. Baron, entered into a written lease with plaintiff, Benjamin Bloom, under which they demised, to the latter, parts of the premises in question, for the term of three years from January 26, 1919, and gave him an option to purchase, expressed in this language: \u201cFor the period of one year from the date hereof, the lessee shall have the option to purchase said premises for the sum of fifteen thousand dollars, subject only to a certain ground rent of forty dollars per annum and to a mortgage of ten thousand dollars; this option shall absolutely cease unless exercised in writing within one year from the date hereof and followed by settlement within thirty days from the date of such written notice of the exercise of said option, and the lessee be stilTin occupancy of the demised premises.\u201d\nOn April 9,1919, plaintiff entered into a written agreement with defendants to purchase the premises. This contract recites that \u201cBenjamin Bloom has determined to exercise the option contained in the lease to him\u201d; it acknowledges the payment of $500, and stipulates that settlement shall be made by plaintiff \u201cbefore October 1, 1919.\u201d It further provides as follows: \u201cTime is to be considered as of the essence of this agreement, and in the event of the default of Mr. Bloom to make settlement ......by October 1st, 1919, at the latest, then the sum of $500 hereby paid is to be considered as liquidated damages, and shall be retained on account thereof, and the option shall be considered as ended and cancelled.\u201d\nAfter April 9,1919, plaintiff altered and improved the premises, for the purposes of his business.\nPlaintiff \u201cwas not prepared at any time on or prior to October 1, 1919, to make settlement for the purchase of said premises,\u201d nor did he before then \u201ctender performance of the terms of said option or of said contract.\u201d\nOn or about October 29,1919, however, plaintiff served a written notice on defendants that he would exercise the option within thirty days from date, and would notify them as to the exact date of settlement, which would be within thirty days from the date of his letter; and in his bill plaintiff avers readiness \u201cto make settlement for the purchase of said premises, in accordance with the terms of the option recited in said lease, within the period of thirty days from and after October 29, 1919, the date of said notice.\u201d\n\u201cDefendants refused to acknowledge said notice of October 29,1919, as of any validity, and informed plaintiff that his option to purchase said premises ended and terminated October 1, 1919, when he failed to comply with the terms of said written contract of April 9,1919; whereupon the plaintiff filed the bill in this proceeding ......, praying that defendants be required to convey said premises......to plaintiff, upon the latter making payment of the purchase money as mentioned in the option in said lease.\u201d\nFinally the chancellor found that, \u201cupon the hearing of the cause, plaintiff produced in court, and tendered defendants, a certified check for $4,000, and stated that he had arranged for the raising of $12,000 additional from the Leland Building Association, upon a second mortgage; the latter sum was not produced or actually tendered, and, other than this, no formal tender of performance was made by plaintiff.\u201d\nIn dismissing the bill, the learned chancellor correctly said: \u201cThe option for purchase contained in the lease of December 26, 1918, was transformed into and became a complete and binding contract of purchase by virtue of the written agreement of April 9, 1919,......, and the said option became wholly merged in said contract. ......When plaintiff defaulted in that contract of purchase, by failing to make settlement on or before October 1, 1919, having expressly stipulated that time should be of the essence of the contract, his right to ask for a decree for conveyance from the defendants was gone; his option to purchase was at an end, and he could not revive it by means of the written notice of October 29, 1919.\u201d\nOn the subject of consideration for the contract of April 9, 1919, the court below properly states: \u201cAs it is set forth in the lease, the option provides for settlement for the purchase within thirty days from the date of written notice of the exercise of the option; this, if enforced, would require settlement to be made on or before May 9,1919, if the date of notice of exercise was April 9, 1919. The contract of April 9, 1919, however, gives plaintiff, the purchaser, more liberal terms as to time, making the period for settlement almost six months instead of thirty days \u2014 stipulating for settlement \u2018by October 1st, 1919, at the latest/ but expressly making time as of the essence of the agreement, and providing that, if settlement be not made \u2018by October 1, 1919, at the latest/ the sum of $500, the hand money paid, shall be considered as liquidated damages to be retained on account thereof, and that \u2018the option shall be considered as ended and cancelled.\u201d This extension of time, from thirty days to almost six months, for settlement was a new, and a good and sufficient, consideration from defendants for these covenants on the part of plaintiff as to the cancellation of his option, the making time for performance, not later than October 1, 1919, as of the essence of the contract and the stipulating for the payment of liquidated damages for breach.\u201d\nThe assignments of error are not in proper form; they are all dismissed.\nThe decree is affirmed at cost of appellant."}
