{"id": "1211015", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nSamuel Friedheim made his will on September 18, 1925, and he executed a codicil thereto on May 4, 1927. He died June 29, 1927. In his will he provided, inter alia, that his residuary estate be held in trust, for investment and reinvestment and that certain stated sums as income therefrom should be paid monthly to, respectively, a brother and two nieces, for life and \u201cthe remainder of the income, together with the income . . . after the deaths of the respective parties\u201d (supra) should be paid unto Mg wife. Upon the death of all of the beneficiaries of this trust, he provided for a distribution of the principal of the trust estate. In her lifetime the wife could also receive \u201csuch portions of the principal as she may deem necessary\u201d.\nThe will further provided that when the trust terminated, $5,000. should be paid to testator\u2019s brother-in-law and the balance be divided into four equal parts, one of which should be paid \u201cto such charity or charities as she [i. e. his wife] shall by writing during her lifetime designate\u201d. The wife duly designated as such charity the Jewish Hospital Association of Philadelphia. The remaining three parts of the balance of the fund was to be paid in equal shares to three nieces. These nieces and the charity named are the appellants here.\nThe codicil to testator\u2019s will reads as follows: \u201cAfter the death of my wife Sophie Sternau Friedheim I wish $20,000.00 Twenty-thousand dollars to be put in Trust for my dear nephew and niece Dr. Louis and Fannie Friedheim.\u201d This nephew and niece are nowhere mentioned in testator\u2019s toill. It is the contention of the appellants that when the testator in his codicil directed $20,000. to \u201cbe put in trust\u201d for the nephew and the niece therein named he intended the codicil as \u201cmerely continuing the trust in the stated amount of $20,000. during the lifetime\u201d of these two beneficiaries, with remainder over as provided in the will.\nWe agree with the learned Auditing Judge (Ladner) that the gift made in the codicil to the nephew and the niece Dr. Louis and Fannie Friedheim is absolute and that Fannie Friedheim, the surviving spouse of Dr. Louis Friedheim, takes the legacy of $20,000. absolutely. The trust created by the codicil is manifestly not an active but a \u201cdry trust\u201d, i. e. a trust whose nature is not qualified by the settlor and where the cestui que trust has the right to be put into actual possession of the subject of the trust.\nTo hold as appellants contend, would be merely to surmise that testator intended the $20,000. bequeathed in Ms codicil to be treated.like \u201cthe rest, residue and remainder\u201d of Ms estate which in his will he bequeathed to his executors \u201cin trust\u201d for certain carefully specified purposes, and then to let this \u201csurmise\u201d override the plain words of the codicil. Nothing is better settled in law than that a legacy created by such language as is used in this codicil vests absolutely. Jeremy\u2019s Est., Jeremy\u2019s Appeal, 178 Pa. 477, 478, 35 A. 847: \u201cNo active trust having been expressly imposed upon the trustees, nor implied . . . the trust must have become executed, and the . . . estate vested.\u201d In Dodson v. Ball, 60 Pa. 492, 496, Justice Agnew speaking for this court said: \u201cA simple trust gives to the cestui que trust a right to the possession, control and disposal of the property, . . .\u201d To hold other than the court below held would be to rewrite testator\u2019s will. This the courts have no power to do.\nThe decree is affirmed at appellants\u2019 cost."}
