{"id": "559332", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Superior Court which affirmed the decision of the Philadelphia County Common Pleas Court. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\nFollowing a bench trial, Appellant, David Comer, was convicted of recklessly endangering another person, homicide by vehicle, involuntary manslaughter, and aggravated assault. Post-verdict motions were denied and Appellant received a sentence of two and one half to five years imprisonment for homicide by vehicle, a consecutive sentence of two and one half to five years for involuntary manslaughter and a concurrent sentence of five to ten years for aggravated assault.\nWe granted allocatur to address four issues. The first two issues challenge the sufficiency of the evidence for Appellant\u2019s convictions of aggravated assault and involuntary manslaughter. In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine whether the evidence and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, are sufficient to establish all the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Brown, 544 Pa. 406, 676 A.2d 1178 (1996).\nViewed in this light, the evidence established that on July 28, 1992, at approximately 4:00 or 5:00 p.m., Appellant arrived at a pool party in Philadelphia. While there, he met his friend Matt Engler. Engler testified that both he and Appellant drank beer and that both men took pills described as \u201cmuscle relaxers\u201d or \u201cdowners.\u201d He stated that the pills were given to them by another individual at the party. When asked how much beer Appellant drank, Engler responded, \u201cNot much.\u201d Appellant himself testified that he drank four or five beers at the party..\nShortly after midnight, Appellant and Engler left the party en route to a bar. Appellant, driving a rented white Buick Regal, travelled southbound in the right hand lane on Roosevelt Boulevard. He was driving at an excessive rate of speed when his right tire began to rub the curb near Grant Avenue. The vehicle then left the roadway, crashed into a SEPTA bus stand, and continued until it struck a brick wall. Justin Freeland and Carol Velozzi were waiting for a bus when Appellant\u2019s car came crashing through. Freeland died at the scene. Velozzi\u2019s leg was broken and she was hospitalized for two weeks.\nEvidence introduced at trial established that the posted speed limit was 45 m.p.h. Two eyewitnesses testified that immediately prior to the accident they observed Appellant\u2019s vehicle travelling at a speed exceeding 45 m.p.h. Mary Ann Schacta testified that she estimated the speed of Appellant\u2019s vehicle as 55 m.p.h. Steven Sacco, a tow truck driver, testified that Appellant\u2019s vehicle passed him and was \u201cout of control,\u201d travelling in excess of 70 m.p.h. No skid marks appeared on the pavement and there was no other evidence indicating that Appellant quickly applied his brakes. The evidence also established that there was no obstruction on the roadway at the time of the accident.\nOfficer Donald Lowenthal was the first officer to arrive at the scene. When he approached Appellant he detected a slight odor of alcohol. A blood alcohol content (BAC) test was administered at 2:07 a.m. which revealed an alcohol content of .033.\nWe shall first address the sufficiency of evidence issue relating to Appellant\u2019s conviction for aggravated assault. A person is guilty of aggravated assault if he \u201cattempts to cause serious bodily injury to another, or causes such injury intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702(a)(1).\nWe examined the requisite mens rea of recklessness for an aggravated assault conviction in Commonwealth v. O\u2019Hanlon, 539 Pa. 478, 653 A.2d 616 (1995). In O\u2019Hanlon, the defendant, while severely intoxicated, drove his vehicle through a red light and struck another vehicle. Both the defendant and the driver of the other vehicle were seriously injured.\nIn reversing the conviction for aggravated assault, we found that there was an increased degree of recklessness required by the aggravated assault statute, i.e., reckless \u201cunder circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d We held that\nmere recklessness is insufficient to support a conviction for aggravated assault, which requires a higher degree of culpability, i.e., that which considers and then disregards the threat necessarily posed to human life by the offending conduct. There must be an element of deliberation or conscious disregard of danger not present to the same extent in, e.g., either reckless endangerment ... or driving while intoxicated.\nId. at 482, 653 A.2d at 618.\nWe further stated that\nfor the degree of recklessness contained in the aggravated assault statute to occur, the offensive act must be performed under circumstances which almost assure that life threatening injury will ensue. The recklessness must, therefore, be such that life threatening injury is essentially certain to occur. This state of mind is, accordingly, equivalent to that which seeks to cause injury.\nId.\nIn O\u2019Hanlon, we noted that examples of recklessness in which life threatening injury is essentially certain to occur include firing a gun into a crowd, Commonwealth v. Daniels, 467 Pa. 35, 354 A.2d 538 (1976), or driving a vehicle into a crowd after having aimed the vehicle at a particular individual, Commonwealth v. Laing, 310 Pa.Super. 105, 456 A.2d 204 (1983).\nApplying the aforementioned law to the facts of this case, we find that the Commonwealth did not establish that Appellant possessed the state of mind equivalent to that which seeks to cause injury. The evidence established that Appellant was driving at an excessive rate of speed after consuming four or five beers and ingesting at least one \u201cdowner\u201d at some time prior to the accident. While Appellant\u2019s actions are clearly criminal, they do not constitute aggravated assault.\nThe Commonwealth argues that this case is controlled by Commonwealth v. Scofield, 360 Pa.Super. 552, 521 A.2d 40 (1987), alloc, denied, 517 Pa. 593, 535 A.2d 82 (1987), where the defendant\u2019s aggravated assault conviction was sustained when it was established that he drove his vehicle in an erratic manner after consuming a small amount of alcohol and ingesting drags. Although superficially similar, the case is factually distinguishable.\nIn Scofield, the defendant was driving his vehicle and scraping his car against the bumper of a vehicle parked on the street. Sparks were flying and the defendant travelled another ten feet in this manner before swerving onto the sidewalk and striking a building. A nearby cabdriver realized that the defendant had struck a pedestrian, who was under the right fender of the defendant\u2019s vehicle. The cabdriver directed the defendant to turn the car off and even attempted to reach into the car to remove the keys from the ignition. The defendant became belligerent, hit the cabdriver and attempted to bite him. The defendant then unsuccessfully tried to put his car into reverse, but a flat tire prevented his flight. As a result of the incident, the pedestrian\u2019s leg was amputated.\nAlthough the defendant\u2019s BAC was only .004, a drug test revealed two different types of barbiturates in his urine. Furthermore, the officer at the scene testified that the defendant had an odor of alcohol on his breath, spoke with a thick tongue, had a hard time standing and had to be helped away from the vehicle.\nThe Superior Court concluded that the record was replete with evidence that the defendant operated his car in an intentionally reckless manner. It noted that the defendant repeatedly scraped his car against parked vehicles, and that he had no regard for the victim\u2019s plight when confronted with the situation. The court found that the defendant\u2019s behavior prior to and after the accident established that he was aware of his reckless conduct. Thus the defendant considered, then disregarded, the threat to the life of the victim. These circumstances demonstrate a higher degree of recklessness than those presented in the instant case.\nIn contrast, Appellant sped past another vehicle, his car rubbed the curb of the sidewalk and the accident ensued immediately thereafter. The fact that both Appellant and the defendant in Scofield drank alcohol and ingested some amount of a controlled substance is not controlling. As we find Appellant\u2019s conduct more akin to that which occurred in O\u2019Hanlon, we reverse his conviction for aggravated assault.\nWe next examine Appellant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for involuntary manslaughter. A person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when, as a direct result of the doing of an act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2504.\nWe have held that there is a distinction between the term \u201cnegligently\u201d as set forth in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(b)(4) and \u201crecklessly\u201d as set for in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(b)(3). The latter definition encompasses gross negligence. Commonwealth v. Lobiondo, 501 Pa. 599, 462 A.2d 662 (1983). Section 302(b)(3) defines \u201crecklessly\u201d as follows:\nA person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and intent of the actor\u2019s conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(b)(3).\nAs noted, this is a lesser degree of \u201crecklessness\u201d than that required for a conviction of aggravated assault. Such concept is logical considering the fact that aggravated assault is a second degree felony, while in most cases involuntary manslaughter is a first degree misdemeanor. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2702(b) and 2504(b). The difference in the grading of the crimes reflects the distinct state of mind required of the actor in each circumstance.\nRecognizing this distinction, we find that there was sufficient evidence to establish that Appellant acted with the recklessness contemplated by the involuntary manslaughter statute. See Commonwealth v. Mayberry, 290 Pa. 195,138 A. 686 (1927) (individual negligently operating his vehicle at an unlawful speed was guilty of involuntary manslaughter for death resulting therefrom); see also Commonwealth v. Honeycutt, 227 Pa.Super. 265, 323 A.2d 775 (1974) (one is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when his racing with another vehicle was the proximate cause of a fatal accident); Commonwealth v. Hicks, 203 Pa.Super. 307, 201 A.2d 294 (1964) (involuntary manslaughter established when defendant drank \u201ca little wine,\u201d drove his vehicle through a red light, killed a pedestrian, and failed to stop and render aid); Commonwealth v. Holman, 160 Pa.Super. 211, 50 A.2d 720 (1947) (involuntary manslaughter conviction sustained when defendant was speeding and fatally struck a child with his vehicle in broad daylight with no obstructions of view); compare Commonwealth v. Cienkowslci, 290 Pa.Super. 415, 434 A.2d 821 (1981) (mere Vehicle Code violation is insufficient to establish recklessness or gross negligence required to prove involuntary manslaughter); Commonwealth v. Trainor, 252 Pa.Super. 332, 381 A.2d 944 (1977) (brief encroachment onto wrong side of road due to inattention to driving is insufficient to establish involuntary manslaughter).\nAppellant next contends that the lower courts erred in concluding that he made a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to a jury trial under Pa.R.Crim.P. 1101. Appellant acknowledges that Judge Ribner, who presided over the trial, conducted an on the record colloquy which apprised him of the essential elements of a jury trial. Appellant contends, however, that his waiver was unknowing due to the fact that Judge Ribner did not disclose that he had previously been a victim of a drunk driving accident. He asserts that had he known such information, he would not have waived his right to a jury trial.5 ***\nIn all cases, the defendant may waive a jury trial with approval by a judge of the court in which the case is pending, and elect to be tried by a judge without a jury. The judge shall ascertain from the defendant whether this is a knowing and intelligent waiver and such colloquy shall appear on the record. The waiver shall be in writing, made a part of the record, signed by the defendant, the judge, and the defendant\u2019s attorney as a witness.\nWe have held that all litigants have the right to believe that the jurist they are appearing before is impartial and unbiased and that the jurist will promptly bring to the attention of the parties any latent biases or personal interests which might possibly affect their judgment in the case. Reilly v. SEPTA, 507 Pa. 204, 489 A.2d 1291 (1985). As Judge Ribner\u2019s accident with a drunk driver ten years prior to Appellant\u2019s trial does not demonstrate that he possessed a latent bias or a personal interest affecting his judgment in the case, he was under no obligation to disclose the circumstances to Appellant. Appellant has presented absolutely no evidence that Judge Ribner\u2019s judgment in this case was affected in any way by his prior experience. Accordingly, Appellant\u2019s lack of knowledge of a fact that was irrelevant to the resolution of his case does not render his otherwise knowing jury trial waiver invalid.\nAppellant finally contends that because his convictions for involuntary manslaughter and homicide by vehicle were based upon the same conduct and caused a single death, the imposition of multiple sentences violates the double jeopardy clauses of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the United States Constitution.\nIn Commonwealth v. Houtz, 496 Pa. 345, 437 A.2d 385 (1981), we held that double jeopardy prevented the imposition of separate sentences for homicide by vehicle and involuntary manslaughter when the same act served as the basis for both offenses. Finding that the culpable conduct necessary for a conviction of homicide by vehicle was subsumed by the more stringent counterparts contained in the crime of involuntary manslaughter, we vacated the sentence imposed for homicide by vehicle. In doing so, we found that involuntary manslaughter as charged required proof that the actor engaged in a Vehicle Code violation in a reckless or grossly negligent manner and that the death was caused as a direct result. Because neither provision required proof which the other did not, we concluded that the defendant could only be sentenced for one offense.\nThe Superior Court, however, failed to follow Houtz in the instant case, finding that it was no longer valid in light of our decision in Commonwealth v. Anderson, 538 Pa. 574, 650 A.2d 20 (1994). The court interpreted Anderson as holding that to determine whether one offense is a greater or lesser included offense of the other, the statutory elements of the offenses must be compared without considering the underlying factual circumstances.\nThe offense of homicide by vehicle requires (1) the unintentional causing of a death, (2) while engaged in a violation of any law, municipal ordinance, or traffic regulation, which relates to the operation or use of a vehicle. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3732. The elements of involuntary manslaughter include: (1) the commission of an act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, (2) which causes the death of another person. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2504.\nThe Superior Court concluded that homicide by vehicle is not a lesser included offense of involuntary manslaughter since it requires an additional element, a violation of the Vehicle Code. Likewise, it concluded that involuntary manslaughter is not a lesser included offense of homicide by vehicle since it requires a higher degree of culpability.\nAlthough the simplicity of this analysis is appealing, it ignores the context in which the Anderson rule was created. In Anderson, the defendant committed one criminal act; he shot the victim and critically injured her. In determining whether the single criminal act could support multiple sentences for attempted murder and aggravated assault, we examined whether the crimes were greater and lesser included offenses, i.e., whether the elements of the lesser included offense were a necessary subcomponent but not a sufficient component of elements of the other crime.\nWe recognized that the standard used to determine whether two charges constitute the \u201csame offense\u201d was first articulated by the U.S. Supreme Court in Blockburger v. U.S., 284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932):\nThe applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether they are two offenses or only one is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.\nIn Anderson, we found that the offenses of attempted murder and aggravated assault did not require proof of a fact which the other did not. The same is true in the instant case. Appellant\u2019s act of recklessly driving his vehicle into the SEPTA bus stand supports both the general element of the \u201ccommission of a reckless act\u201d of involuntary manslaughter and the specific requirement of a Vehicle Code violation of homicide by vehicle. Thus the elements of homicide by vehicle as charged are subsumed in the elements of involuntary manslaughter and neither offense requires proof which the other does not. Because imposing separate sentences violates double jeopardy, the two offenses merge for sentencing purposes. As our decision in Houtz is consistent with our analysis in Anderson, the Superior Court erred in disregarding it.\nIn summary, we affirm in part and reverse in part the order of the Superior Court. The judgments of sentence as to aggravated assault and homicide by vehicle are hereby vacated; as to involuntary manslaughter, the judgment of sentence is affirmed.\nCASTILLE, J., files a Dissenting Opinion in which NEWMAN, J., joins.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2705.\n. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3732.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2504.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702(a)(1).\n. On cross-examination, Engler testified that he did not recall whether Appellant ingested one or several pills and also did not recall when he made such observation.\n. The defendant's blood alcohol content based on a blood serum reading was .224.\n. When the victim is under twelve years of age and is in the care, custody or control of the defendant, involuntary manslaughter is a felony of the second degree.\n. This rule provides as follows:\n. Appellant apparently became aware of Judge Ribner\u2019s prior accident after sentencing since he first challenged the judge\u2019s impartiality in his motion for reconsideration of sentence.\n. Article I, Section 10 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides in pertinent part that \"[n]o person shall, for the same offense, be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb....\"\nThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution similarly states \"... nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life and limb....\"\nWe have held that the same inquiry is involved in determining whether double jeopardy is violated and whether crimes are greater or lesser included offenses and therefore merge for sentencing purposes. Commonwealth v. Anderson, 538 Pa. 574, 580, 650 A.2d 20, 23 (1994).\n. Judge Wieand filed a concurring and dissenting statement in the instant matter wherein he relied on Houtz and stated that he would vacate the sentence imposed for homicide by vehicle as a violation of double jeopardy.\n. The Superior Court followed this approach in Commonwealth v. Alarle, 378 Pa.Super. 11, 547 A.2d 1252 (1988), alloc, denied, 521 Pa. 616, 557 A.2d 720 (1989), and Commonwealth v. Hernandez, 339 Pa.Super. 32, 488 A.2d 293 (1985).\n. The court also found Houtz distinguishable. It held that unlike the instant case where Appellant\u2019s convictions were supported by different criminal conduct, i.e., excessive speed in the case of the homicide by vehicle conviction and impairment by intoxication in the case of the involuntary manslaughter conviction, the convictions in Houtz were based on a single criminal act, driving erratically and swerving into the passing lane. We reject this hypertechnical examination of the facts and find that Appellant\u2019s reckless operation of his vehicle was the basis for both his convictions of homicide by vehicle and involuntary manslaughter.\n. The mens rea for homicide by vehicle is satisfied when the defendant acts in a criminally negligent or reckless manner. Commonwealth v. Heck, 517 Pa. 192, 535 A.2d 575 (1987).\n. We recognized in Anderson that \"any merger analysis must proceed on the basis of its facts, some aspects of the statute are relevant while others are not.\" Id. at 582 n. 3, 650 A.2d 20."}
