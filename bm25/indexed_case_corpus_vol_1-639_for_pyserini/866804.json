{"id": "866804", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn this case, the summons was returned by the sheriff: \u201c Served the Blue Mountain Manufacturing Company, a corporation under the laws of Pennsylvania, by giving, June 22, 1893, a true and attested copy of the within writ to D. B. Fisher, general manager of said company and making known to him the contents thereof.\u201d Judgment having been entered against defendant company for want of an affidavit of defense, a rule was taken to set aside the sheriff\u2019s return and strike off the judgment. That rule was made absolute, and hence this appeal, in which the sole question is whether the sheriff\u2019s return shows a \u2022sufficient service of the writ. The learned judge rightly held that the service was insufficient because it was not made on the \u201c president or other principal officer, or on the cashier, treasurer, secretary or chief clerk \u201d of the corporation defendant, as required by the act of June 13,1836, section 41. As shown by the court below, the words, \u201c president or other principal officer,\u201d mean the chief executive officer of the corporation, whether called chairman, president, or by any other title, and were not intended to include \u201cgeneral manager.\u201d The question is so fully and satisfactorily considered by the learned judge of the \u25a0common pleas that further comment is unnecessary.\nWe affirm the judgment on his opinion.\nJudgment affirmed."}
