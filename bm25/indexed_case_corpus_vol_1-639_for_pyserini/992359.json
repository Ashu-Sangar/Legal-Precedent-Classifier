{"id": "992359", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Brown,\nThe only error complained of on this appeal is the granting of a new trial by the court below. The verdict was for the defendant, which, on application of the plaintiff, for reasons assigned, was set aside and a new trial awarded. The testimony taken in the case is not before us ; but, from the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of it in the judge\u2019s charge, his discretion in setting aside the verdict was not abused, and the order making the rule for a new trial absolute is affirmed."}
