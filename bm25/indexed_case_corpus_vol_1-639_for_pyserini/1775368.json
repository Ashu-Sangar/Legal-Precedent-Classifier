{"id": "1775368", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM.\nThe appeal of the Commonwealth at No. 286 January Term, 1979, is quashed, as we do not believe the order suppressing the weapon substantially impairs the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, 411 Pa. 56, 190 A.2d 304 (1963). Furthermore, despite the trial court\u2019s certification, we refuse to accept the interlocutory appeal of the accused and we thus dismiss the appeal at No. 307 January Term, 1979.\nKAUFFMAN and WILKINSON, JJ., did not participate in the decision of this case."}
