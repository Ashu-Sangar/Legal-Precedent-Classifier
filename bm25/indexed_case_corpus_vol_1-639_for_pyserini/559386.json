{"id": "559386", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nOn October 10, 1995, Appellant filed in the Superior Court a pro se Notice of Appeal \u201cfrom the Order entered in this matter on the 29th day of September, 1995, denying Reconsideration of the Order entered August 17, 1995[,] granting Plaintiffs Petition for Leave to Sell Real Estate.\u201d Although this pro se filing was designated as an appeal from an order denying reconsideration, there was no such order since reconsideration had never been sought. The September 29, 1995 order was a denial of Appellant\u2019s \u201cEmergency Motion for Relief,\u201d filed that same day. Appellant\u2019s pro se notice of appeal should have been construed as an appeal from the order denying the \u201cEmergency Motion for Relief,\u201d in which case it was timely filed and should not have been quashed as untimely by the Superior Court.\nThe order of the Superior Court, dated January 11, 1996, is vacated. This case is remanded to the Superior Court for consideration of the appeal on the merits."}
