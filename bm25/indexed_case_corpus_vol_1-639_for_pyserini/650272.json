{"id": "650272", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nThis case presents the question of whether the Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act (MPJA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8953, is violated when a police officer leaves his primary jurisdiction to investigate a citizen\u2019s report of a motorist in distress in an adjacent municipality, finds probable cause to believe the motorist is intoxicated, and detains the motorist until an officer from that jurisdiction arrives. We hold it is not.\nIn the early morning hours of August 14, 1999, a private citizen stopped Officer Robert Wagner of the New Wilmington Police Department and informed him a red car was parked on a highway three-quarters of mile away with its driver slumped over. The citizen expressed concern for the driver\u2019s safety. Wagner drove to the scene and found the car parked perpendicular to the highway with its headlights on, engine running, window down, and radio blaring. The car turned out to be located a quarter-mile outside the Borough of New Wilmington, in neighboring Wilmington Township. The border between the municipalities also constitutes the line between Lawrence and Mercer Counties. Wagner approached the car and saw appellant in the front seat, slumped over in a deep sleep. Concerned for appellant\u2019s well-being, Wagner attempted to awaken him, which turned out to be more difficult than expected; it took Wagner three to four minutes of shouting and shaking to rouse appellant. Appellant smelled of alcohol and did not know where he was or why he was there. After determining appellant did not need medical attention, Wagner requested his driver\u2019s license. Believing appellant was intoxicated, Wagner radioed the state police, who asked him to stand by until a trooper arrived. In the interim, Wagner had appellant perform a field sobriety test, after which the two \u201cchit-chatted\u201d until the state police arrived 30 minutes later. The state police administered another field sobriety test\u2014 which appellant failed\u2014and arrested him for driving under the influence of alcohol.\nAppellant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress evidence was denied. The suppression court held Officer Wagner had not violated the MPJA by leaving his jurisdiction and detaining appellant until the state police arrived. The suppression court noted even if the MPJA did not authorize Wagner\u2019s actions, the state police would have \u201cinevitably discovered\u201d appellant\u2019s intoxicated condition. A jury subsequently found appellant guilty of operating a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.1% or greater, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731(a)(4). The Superior Court affirmed, Commonwealth v. Lehman, 820 A.2d 766 (Pa.Super.2003), but relied solely on the inevitable discovery doctrine after finding the MPJA did not authorize Wagner\u2019s actions. We granted allowance of appeal. Commonwealth v. Lehman, 575 Pa. 684, 834 A.2d 1141 (2003).\nContrary to the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion, we find the MPJA does not prohibit Officer Wagner\u2019s conduct. The MPJA permits an officer to enforce the laws beyond the territorial limits of his jurisdiction \u201c[w]here the officer is on official business and views an offense, or has probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed.... \u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8953(a)(5). The Superior Court, finding Officer Wagner \u201cacted in his official capacity to assure a citizen\u2019s well-being, an affirmative duty imposed upon him by virtue of his position as a public servant,\u201d Lehman, at 770-71, nonetheless held his actions did not fall within \u00a7 8953(a)(5) because he did not see appellant committing an offense or have probable cause to believe appellant had committed an offense at the time he left his jurisdiction to investigate the citizen\u2019s report. Id., at 770.\nWe have previously noted the MPJA should be liberally construed to achieve its purposes, one of which is to provide police with the authority to act as police officers outside their jurisdictions in limited circumstances. Commonwealth v. Merchant, 528 Pa. 161, 595 A.2d 1135, 1138 (1991). The MPJA is intended to promote public safety while maintaining police accountability to local authority; it is not intended to erect \u201cimpenetrable jurisdictional walls benefitfing] only criminals hidden in their shadows.\u201d Id., at 1139. In support of his claim the MPJA will not countenance Officer Wagner\u2019s conduct, appellant cites Commonwealth v. McCandless, 538 Pa. 286, 648 A.2d 309 (1994), Commonwealth v. Mason, 535 Pa. 560, 637 A.2d 251 (1993), Commonwealth v. Pratti, 530 Pa. 256, 608 A.2d 488 (1992), and Commonwealth v. Merchant, supra. Of these, only Pratti and Merchant are on point, and our reading of them leads us to conclude the MPJA authorizes Officer Wagner\u2019s conduct.\nIn Pratti, an on-duty officer of the Millvale Borough Police Department, consistent with routine practice, crossed into Shaler Township to turn around in a service station parking lot. While in the parking lot, the officer heard a loud noise that sounded like a car accident, so he drove further into Shaler Township to investigate. The officer came upon a stop sign lying in the road and saw a car ahead of him swerving back and forth across the centerline. The officer stopped the vehicle, observed its driver was intoxicated, and summoned the Shaler Township Police Department. The defendant claimed the MPJA did not authorize his detention by the out-of-jurisdiction Millvale officer. This Court disagreed, finding the officer was on \u201cofficial business\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 8953(a)(5) when he made the routine turnaround, and holding he had an affirmative duty to investigate a suspected car accident and render assistance if necessary. Pratti, at 490. This Court further held the officer, upon seeing the fallen stop sign and swerving car, had the requisite probable cause to stop the defendant under \u00a7 8953(a)(5). Id.\nIn Merchant, two on-duty officers of the Etna Police Department were traveling through the Borough of Aspinwall, as was customary in order to reach a limited access highway through Etna, when they noticed a car cross the centerline and nearly strike an oncoming vehicle. The officers stopped the car, determined its driver was intoxicated, and detained him until the Aspinwall police arrived. The defendant claimed the MPJA did not authorize his detention by the out-of-jurisdiction Etna officers. This Court disagreed, finding the officers were on \u201cofficial business\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 8953(a)(5) in traveling their usual route as part of their routine responsibilities. Merchant, at 1139. We further held the officers, upon seeing the defendant nearly strike an oncoming vehicle, had probable cause to believe an offense had been committed, and noted the Etna officers \u201climited the impact of their activities outside their primary jurisdiction by merely detaining [the defendant] while awaiting arrival of the Aspinwall police.\u201d Id.\nConsidering the present case as well as Pratti and Merchant, we are led to the following rule: section 8953(a)(5) of the MPJA authorizes an extrajurisdictional detention where the detaining officer is on-duty, outside his or her jurisdiction for a routine or customary reason including responding to an exigent circumstance, develops probable cause to believe an offense has been committed, and limits out-of-jurisdiction activities to maintaining the status quo, including detaining the suspect, until officers from the appropriate jurisdiction arrive.\nApplication of this rule to appellant\u2019s case shows the MPJA does not forbid what Officer Wagner did here. Officer Wagner was on-duty inside his jurisdiction when a citizen reported a car parked less than a mile away whose driver was slumped over and may have needed medical assistance. Officer Wagner responded and found probable cause to believe appellant was driving under the influence, and he limited his out-of-jurisdiction activities to detaining appellant and summoning officers with jurisdiction, in this case the state police. The fact that Officer Wagner learned of the exigency while he was within his jurisdiction, rather than already outside of it as in Pratti and Merchant, does not render this ease inconsistent with those cases\u2014the duty to act is triggered by the exigency, not the officer\u2019s relationship to the municipal border when it arises.\nExcluding the evidence in this case would not advance any of the purposes the MPJA was designed to serve. The legislative intent behind the MPJA\u2014to enable municipal police officers to protect all of the public while maintaining their accountability to local authority\u2014is promoted by allowing Officer Wagner to take the reasonable steps he did here. The \u201cofficial duties\u201d of a police officer at times extend outside the home jurisdiction\u2019s political boundaries, and appropriate responses to exigencies must be allowed, as the statute acknowledges. Authorizing expedient but limited responses is only common sense; they save lives and property without infringement on anyone\u2019s rights.\nOfficer Wagner was not engaged in an extrajurisdictional fishing expedition nor an attempt to expand his sphere of power. Had appellant in fact needed assistance, Officer Wagner was in the best position to provide it. Had appellant had a heart attack rather than been drunk, he would urge us to permit Officer Wagner to help him. Allowing officers to do their duty most effectively and beneficially to the public will sometimes put them in a position to see crimes and find drunken drivers\u2014such would be a poor reason to limit their ability to provide the full measure of service to the public that is possible.\nBecause Officer Wagner\u2019s actions did not violate the MPJA, we need not address the merits of the Superior Court\u2019s application of the inevitable discovery doctrine. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\n. McCandless involves the \"hot pursuit\" provision of \u00a7 8953(a)(2) of the MPJA, and Mason addresses the appropriate remedy for a violation of the Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding the issuance and execution of a search warrant outside an officer\u2019s jurisdiction.\n. The results of the field sobriety test Officer Wagner administered were not admitted at appellant's trial, and we express no opinion as to their admissibility."}
