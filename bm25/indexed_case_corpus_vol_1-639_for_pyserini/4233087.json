Allocatur is DENIED as to all remaining issues. The issue, as stated by petitioner, is:\nWhether the Superior Court erred in ruling that although the trial court plainly violated Pa.R.Crim.P. 631(E)(2) by requiring [petitioner] to exercise peremptory challenges before the exercise of all challenges for cause, said error was not per se prejudicial, nor prejudicial to [petitioner] under the circumstances, where, as demonstrated by the dissent, in this instance the trial court\u2019s misapplication of an important rule of criminal procedure pertaining to the exercise of the right to trial by jury cannot reasonably be said to have constituted harmless error."}
