{"id": "1785914", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Chief Justice.\nAppellant Government Employees Insurance Company appeals from an order of the Superior Court reversing an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia which dismissed the petition of appellee Selwyn Chesler to compel the payment of \u201csurvivor\u2019s loss\u201d benefits under the Pennsylvania No-fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, Act of July 19, 1974, P.L. 489, \u00a7 101 et seq., 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.101 et seq. (Supp.1983). Appellee is the mother of Barry Chesler, who was killed in an automobile accident while insured under a no-fault automobile insurance policy issued by appellant. Appellee, who has not shown that she was dependent upon her son, contends that she need not prove dependency in order to receive survivor\u2019s benefits under the Act.\nWe hold that section 103 of the Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.103, requires a \u201cchild, parent, brother, [or] sister\u201d of a deceased victim of an automobile accident to show dependency on the victim as a condition of eligibility for survivor\u2019s loss benefits. See Midboe v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 495 Pa. 348, 433 A.2d 1342 (1981) (O\u2019Brien, C.J., joined by Roberts & Flaherty, JJ., in support of affirmance). Section 103 defines a \u201csurvivor\u201d as a\n\u201c(A) spouse; or\n(B) child, parent, brother, sister or relative dependent upon the deceased for support.\u201d\nAs stated in Midboe, supra, \u201cif the Legislature had intended that only [a] \u2018relative\u2019 need prove dependency on the deceased, it could have included \u2018child, parent, brother or sister\u2019 in subsection (A) with \u2018spouse\u2019.\u201d 495 Pa. at 357, 433 A.2d at 1347.\nThe order of the Superior Court reversing the order of the court of common pleas which dismissed the petition to compel the payment of survivor\u2019s loss benefits is reversed.\nNIX, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nHUTCHINSON, J., files a concurring opinion.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion."}
