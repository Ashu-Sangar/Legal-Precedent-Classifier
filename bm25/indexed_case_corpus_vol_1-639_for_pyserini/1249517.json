{"id": "1249517", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Musmanno,\nThe story of this case is one of indiscreet tilting of the bottle, reckless hands at the wheel, witless night racing over streets and railroad crossings, and vindictive rivalry born of crass jealousy plus primitive thinking. The result was a calamitous smash-up with death and mangling injury.\nOn the night of April 9, 1951, John D. Fisher and James Bell met at Dad\u2019s Grill in Grove City of Mercer County and planned an automobile drinking party. From Dad\u2019s Grill they proceeded to the City Grill and there invited Ruth Ann Garner, a girl 13 years of age, to accompany them on their contemplated alcoholic spree. Fisher then telephoned his girl friend, 22-year old Dorothy Gregg, and she joined the group in front of Dad\u2019s Grill some time after 11 o\u2019clock. James Bell summoned his wife (Mary A. Bell), and then Ralph King, a friend of Ruth Ann\u2019s, appeared on the scene to complete the party.\nWith Fisher at the wheel, the merrymakers headed for Mercer, Pennsylvania, drinking whiskey from a bottle as they travelled, Fisher not denying himself a share of the contents. Somewhere east of Mercer (by chance in front of Wilson\u2019s beer garden) Fisher ran off the road, but without resulting mishap. This erratic driving was repeated at least twice again on the journey. Some 25 miles out of Grove City, the gay travellers passed through Sharon and continued on to Masury, Ohio, where they entered the Brookfield Inn for an hour\u2019s drinking and then proceeded to the Sky Club, also beyond the Pennsylvania border, where further alcohol was ordered and consumed.\nAt the Sky Club, one of the girls met for the first time a Robert Trepanosky and he was recruited into the dramatis personae of this spirituous drama of the road. At about 2 a.m., Ruth Ann, the 13-year old, apparently more alert than the older heads about her, voiced the apprehension that Fisher\u2019s excessive drinking cast doubts on his ability to drive with safety. Trepanosky volunteered to ask his friend, John Allison, also in the night club, to take the girls home in his car, whereupon Allison entered the scenario of the impending and unfolding tragedy. Some time later, Dorothy and Ruth Ann proceeded on foot from the Sky Club across the State line into Pennsylvania, this being done because of the fear that some law might be violated by transporting the minor Ruth Ann across the boundary between Ohio and Pennsylvania. Allison waited for the girls on a street in Sharon.\nJohn Fisher, while the party was still at the Sky Club, manifested considerable r\u00e9sentment. over Dorothy Gregg\u2019s choice not to ride back with him to Grove City, remonstrating to Allison: \u201cListen, fellow, you better let these girls go home with us.\u201d He then proceeded to argue with Dorothy that she should not travel in Allison\u2019s automobile. Unconvinced by his persuasions, Dorothy walked away from him and he made the cryptic remark (to become significant in the light of what followed) that she would be \u201csorry.\u201d\nAs the Allison car, now carrying as passengers Dorothy Gregg, Ruth Ann Garner and Robert Trepanosky, pulled away from where the girls had boarded it on the West State Street hill in Sharon, Fisher with the remainder of the party determinedly followed in its immediate wake. Fisher trailed the Allison car over various streets and was hard on Allison\u2019s rear as it entered Washington Street in Sharon and committed itself to the rumbling advance over the five railroad tracks which cut across that thoroughfare. Overtaking Allison on the railroad crossing, Fisher swung to the right, striking Allison\u2019s right rear bumper. He maneuvered to the right side of Allison\u2019s speeding automobile, apparently trying to outspeed it. As both cars passed over the last railroad track of the crossing, Fisher shot ahead and at a point estimated to be 21 feet 8 inches from the western end of the crossing, he suddenly cut his wheel to the left into the direct path of Allison and stopped. Allison jammed on his brakes and swung to the left to avoid the barricade of Fisher\u2019s car, but the momentum caused him to jump the curb, bound some. 30 feet across a yard and crash head-on into a tree, the impact instantly killing Robert Trepanosky, knocking the two girls and Allison unconscious and inflicting serious injuries on both Allison and Dorothy.\nDorothy Gregg and the administrator of the estate of Robert Trepanosky brought separate suits against John D. Fisher and John E. Allison, and the individual lawsuits were tried together. The jury exonerated Allison and returned substantial verdicts for both plaintiffs against Fisher. Motions for judgment n.o.v. and new trials were refused and this appeal followed.\nConsidering all the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, as we are required to do on an appeal of this kind, we conclude that the evidence not only supported the verdicts but raised them to a level of objective unassailability. Counsel for John Fisher urges judgment n.o.v. on the ground that the incontrovertible physical evidence shows that the accident could not have happened as described by the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses. In arguing this proposition he points out that the Allison car left the road 21 feet 8 inches beyond the crossing, that the Allison car had a minimum length of 14 feet and that Fisher\u2019s car was a minimum distance of 6 feet ahead of Allison when it started to turn left. This, he maintains, shows that the Fisher ear was at least 20 feet from the crossing when it allegedly turned in front of the Allison car. \u201cAt this point,\u201d he says further, \u201cAllison was within 1 foot 8 inches of the point where he struck the curb.\u201d And then he sums up: \u201cIn order to believe the version of the accident of the plaintiff and her witnesses it must then be believed that the Allison vehicle pivoted from its course upon the street in 1 foot 8 inches and went over the curb.\u201d\nCounsel assumes that the distances referred to are as fixed as Euclid\u2019s tables but in the body of his argument he discloses the shifting potentialities of the factors involved in the accident. He speaks of the Allison vehicle being \u201c1J\u00a1. feet to 18 feet in length\u201d; of the Fisher car being in advance of the Allison vehicle \u201cbetween 6 to 10 feet\u201d-, that Fisher pulled in front of Allison \u201c5 or 6 feet from the left curb;\u201d that the Allison car \u201cwas aloout in the middle of the road.\u201d\nCounsel argues further: \u201c. . . if the length of the Allison car is taken at 16 feet or the distance that the Fisher car was ahead of the Allison car is taken as 8 feet or 10 feet the Allison car would have already started over the curb when the Fisher car began to turn left. It is to be remembered that the cars were traveling parallel, with the Fisher car being 2 to 3 feet away from the Allison vehicle up until this point was reached.\u201d\nA collection of \u201cifs\u201d, \u201cors\u201d \u201cialcens\u201d, and {iwould haves\u201d cannot possibly provide the trestles on which to build the bridge of the doctrine of incontestible physical facts. In Hostetler v. Kniseley, 322 Pa. 248, 250, the appellant sought to apply this doctrine by relying on the speed of the fatal car involved in the accident and the positions of the colliding cars immediately preceding and following the collision, as established by oral evidence. This Court said in that connection: \u201cWe have frequently held that incontrovertible physical facts are never established by oral evidence as to position, speed, etc., of movable objects.\u201d\nWhat we said in Reiser v. Smith, 332 Pa. 389, 393, could well apply to this case: \u201cWe do not find in this record any \u2018incontrovertible physical facts\u2019 which indelibly stamp falsity on the testimony offered in behalf of plaintiff, nor do we find it physically impossible for the accident to have happened in the manner described by the plaintiff and his witnesses.\u201d\nA reading of the record vividly tells a story that does not depend on the juggling of inches and the wheeling into place of ponderous hypotheses to establish verisimilitude or credibility. The witnesses told a perfectly plausible story of a man whose mental outlook was so distorted by the fumes of alcohol and the heat of jealousy that, reckless of consequences, heedless of peril, utterly destitute of moral and legal accountability, he propelled his car across the path of the one containing his assumed jilting girl friend, crazily intending to inflict upon her such distress as would cause her to be \u201csorry\u201d for what she had done.\nIt would be difficult to find in the law books a case where a motorist could be more responsible for a wholly unnecessary and most serious accident than the one which the facts in this litigation portray. With the dawning of reason and the cold realization of what his great folly had accomplished, Fisher took refuge in the palpably incredible explanation that he \u201cblacked out\u201d before the accident (although he continued to drive miles all the way home to Grove City) and therefore had no memory of the accident. He admitted driving from the spot where the Allison car had been parked to the bottom of the hill where he stopped for a red light, and from that point on he was unconscious, although still at the wheel! Some of his amazing testimony follows: \u201cQ. Do you remember driving down over the hill? A. Yes. Q. How far down over the hill, do you remember? A. To the stop light and stopped. Q. What happened after that? A. I don\u2019t know. Q. But you drove the car from then on? A. I did. I was supposed to drive it. Q. You drove that car, the car you were in didn\u2019t you? A. Yes. Q. What kind of a car was it? A. 1940 Plymouth. Q. And you were driving it and didn\u2019t know it, had no recollection of driving it? A. No. Q. What happened to you? A. I can\u2019t remember. Q. You can\u2019t remember a thing? A. No.\u201d\nWhatever may have been the type of mental disturbance or amnesia that Fisher wanted the jury to believe had struck him as he drove his car, he was candid enough to admit the cause of the strange phenomenon: \u201cQ. You drove that car didn\u2019t you? A. I don\u2019t know7 whether I did or not. I don\u2019t remember being off State Street. Q. You have been informed you were the driver of the ear all that time \u2014 is that correct? A. Yes. Q. Do you believe you drove that car? Do you think you did? A. Yes, I do. Q. And your reason\u25a0, then for that blackout is that you had too much to drink? A. Yes.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nOne of the passengers in the Fisher car testified that immediately after the accident Fisher said: \u201cThere\u2019s something going to come of this.\u201d Fisher did not deny that he made this remark, nor did he attempt to explain what kind of mental aberration it was which caused him to evaluate the seriousness of his offence although \u201cblacked out\u201d at the time he committed it.\nIn cross-examining Fisher on his alleged loss of memory, counsel for Allison asked him if he had heard certain testimony at the criminal trial arising out of this same occurrence. Fisher had not taken the witness stand at the criminal trial. Allison\u2019s counsel referred to this fact in cross-examining Fisher and then asked: \u201cAnd as a result in that case you Avere convicted?\u201d Fisher\u2019s counsel objected and the Court sustained the objection, at the same time instructing the jury to disregard the question. Counsel for Fisher then asked for the withdrawal of a juror and this motion was likewise refused.\nAlthough the question put by Allison\u2019s counsel was an unfortunate one, it is not evident, in the light of all the circumstances at the trial, that the Court abused its discretion in refusing to declare a mistrial. The Trial Court twice instructed the jury to disregard any reference to any other proceeding.\nIn Cook v. Erie Electric Motor Co., 225 Pa. 91, this Court said: \u201cIt has been frequently held that in this class of cases no irregularities should be permitted which tend to inflame the prejudices of the jury against the defendant, and in a flagrant case this court will reverse for such error. But so much depends on the immediate circumstances and what may be called the atmosphere of the trial that a large discretion must be allowed to the trial judge.\u201d\nIn Stephens v. Sulkin, 280 Pa. 211, this principle was affirmed: \u201c. . . the question of the withdrawal of a juror depends largely upon the atmosphere of the trial and is a matter for the discretion of the presiding judge.\u201d\nFisher\u2019s counsel urges that the lower court erred in allowing testimony on events and occurrences which preceded by several hours and a number of miles the actual accident, specifically referring to the fact of Fisher\u2019s driving off the road on the outward journey to the Sky Club and the discussions at the Club about the return of the girls in Allison\u2019s car. To restrict the compass of a trial (criminal or civil) to the pinpoint of the culminating crisis would be to make the verdicts of juries mere guesses. Ten witnesses may have been on the scene at the very moment that A shot B, but unless evidence is allowed as to the events which preceded the shooting it would be impossible to determine whether there was involved in the shooting affray such vital items as self-defense, lying in wait, premeditation, intended robbery, revenge, etc., etc. Examining only the tip of a pyramid can offer no intelligence as to the height, width, breadth or the materials which hold it together and raises the crest toward the sky. It is just as important to know what precedes a storm as what follows it in order to ascertain scientifically its meteorological cause.\nThe tragedy at the west end of the Washington .'Street crossing was but the apex of the pyramid of \u2022 occurrences whieb had its base at the Dad\u2019s Grill .in Grove City when Fisher initiated the ill-starred drinking excursion. The quantity of alcohol consumed, the reckless driving on the outward journey, the wrathful arguments at the Sky Club Inn, the vengeful pursuit in the effort to retrieve Fisher\u2019s girl companion were all elements of the gathering storm which broke at the railroad crossing and sent the lightning-blast of death and crippling injuries to Robert Trepanosky and Dorothy Gregg under the ill-omened tree off Washington Street. The learned court below well expressed the principle of law involved in a situation of this kind when it said: \u201cThe law furnishes no test of relevancy, but tacitly refers it to logic and general experience. Evidence is admissible which tends to make the fact at issue more or less probable or intelligible or to show the origin and history of the transaction between the parties and explain its character.\u201d\nAny evidence is relevant and proper provided it fits logically into the pattern of asserted negligence leading to the culminating event which is the subject of the lawsuit. We find no error in the holding of the court below on this point.\nFisher\u2019s counsel complains that the trial court erred in its reference to the testimony of a witness, Donald Riddle who, from a window in his home after hearing a crash, saw the light on the Allison car beside the fatal tree and an automobile, presumed to be the Fisher car, moving forward on Washingt\u00f3n Street. One of the factual disputes at the trial, subsidiary to the main issue of the cause of the collision with the tree, was whether the Fisher car stopped or did not stop after the Allison car left Washington Street and jumped the curb. Riddle did not have a continuous view of the assumed Fisher car as it proceeded on Washington Street into \u2022 Irvine Avenue because an intervening house shut , off his visual pursuit of the moving vehicle for some 165 feet. Riddle\u2019s testimony was not so positive and free of equivocation that the defendant Fisher can use it as a firm and solid foundation for argument that Riddle absolutely disproves the testimony of Allison that the Fisher car stopped just before his (Allison\u2019s) forced diversion from Washington Street. For instance, Riddle was asked as to whether the assumed Fisher car stopped at the scene of the accident: \u201cQ. Now, did you see that car continue to move or did it stop? A. I saw the car next turning onto Irvine Avenue. Q. Did it stop? A. I couldn\u2019t say.\u201d Later on he was certain the car did not stop: \u201cQ. From the time you first saw this car until the last time you saw it, you didn\u2019t see it stop any place? A. No. I didn\u2019t see it stop any place.\u201d Still later, he was in doubt again as to whether the car stopped or not: \u201cQ. It didn\u2019t stop at that stop sign? A. Not that I saw.\u201d\nIt isn\u2019t even certain that the car, the actions of which Riddle described, was the Fisher car. Counsel himself in his brief says: \u201cIf the moving vehicle which Riddle saw was the Fisher car, Fisher was not responsible for the accident for Riddle had already heard the crash and saw the light of the Allison car from behind the tree where the accident occurred.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nIn evaluating Riddle\u2019s testimony, this \u201cIf\u201d becomes as large as the house which obtruded between Riddle and the car, the course of which he was attempting- to follow, and, therefore, stands as a barrier against accepting his testimony as mathematically accurate. The court, therefore, committed no error in indicating to the jury the possibility of doubt arising from Riddle\u2019s testimony. In any event the court instructed the jury that it was their recollection (the jury\u2019s) which was controlling in determining the true facts.\nIt also is urged in behalf of a new trial that the Trial Judge intimated in his charge that statements made by Allison and Gregg at the hospital immediately after the accident had less bearing than those made at the trial. The accident occurred at 3:17 a.m., the police officer spoke to Miss Gregg at 3:45 a.m. The injuries Miss Gregg sustained were of such a grave character that even at the time of trial (two years subsequent to the accident) she could not walk and possibly she will be crippled for life. When the car hit the tree she was rendered unconscious, she sustained bleeding cuts to her face, the right femur bone was broken, and a part of it protruded through the skin. She had lain in the debris of the demolished automobile for some time before an ambulance arrived and she had not even been taken into the emergency room of the hospital when the police officer asked her what had happened. She replied that she did not know. In view of the fact that she later testified in detail to the events which preceded the accident, Fisher complains that this probably manifests some deliberate fabrication of testimony on the part of Dorothy Gregg. In point of human experience, it would have been more unnatural for Dorothy to have remembered what occurred when she was questioned by the policeman than that she should not remember. It is common knowledge that even a healthy person suddenly shaken from a sound slumber, in. the middle of the night cannot instantaneously throw his faculties into the high gear of orientation and recollection. How much more difficult it would be then for a young lady having just passed through the horror of witnessing death. with open eyes, herself having beep knocked unconscious, now bathed in blood and frightful reflections on the possibility of life-long crippling injuries, to narrate coherently what had transpired in the nightmare of her appalling experience?\nNeither common knowledge nor medical science finds it inconsistent that, with the rising of the curtain of fright, the administering of the healing hand of time, and the passing of excruciating pain that one\u2019s memory as to what happened should be clearer several days after the accident than while the clouds of horror still linger over the anguished victim.\nAllison suffered a concussion of the brain and a broken knee as the result of the accident. When questioned by the officer less than 15 minutes after the collision Allison stated that the Fisher car did not stop at the scene of the accident. But in cross-examination he admitted that Allison was dazed at the time: \u201cQ. At the time you interviewed the defendant Allison you knew that he was in a dazed condition? A. Yes, I had that in my office . . . Q. Was Allison in a sort of dazed condition at the time you saw him? A. He was kind of broken up, I wouldn\u2019t call it dazed. Q. Suffering from shock? A. Apparently.\u201d\nUnder these circumstances the Trial Judge not only committed no error, but was in law and justice required to charge as he did: \u201cYou will have in mind that these parties were in at least two taverns and that some of them were drinking. It was three o\u2019clock in the morning when the accident happened. You will consider whether or not any drinking they may have done affected their recollection. You will consider also that at least two of these parties were injured and determine whether or not their condition when they were interviewed by the policemen explains the statements that were inconsistent with what they said in court.\u201d In his appeal ;t.o . this Court , the -appellant states: \u201c6. The court erred in- refusing to.grant.a nevy trial where the jury returned a verdict in favor of one of two joint tortfeasors where the evidence revealed that the exonerated tortfeasor must have been guilty of negligence.\u201d\nAlthough this point apparently was not raised in the court below, we have examined it and find that it is without merit.\nJudgments affirmed."}
