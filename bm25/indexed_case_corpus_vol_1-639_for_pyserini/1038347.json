{"id": "1038347", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Brown,\nJohn Dewar and the Pittsburgh Railways Company are the owners of adjoining lots situated on the north side of California avenue, in the City of Pittsburgh. The frontage of the Dewar ground is one hundred and fifty feet and that of the railways company one hundred feet. The properties extend one hundred and forty feet northward to an alley. They form part of a duly recorded plan of lots, and the title to each of them is subject to the following covenant and condition running with the land, as part of the consideration therefor: \u201cThe above described lots of ground are conveyed by the party of the first part, and purchased and accepted by the party of the second part, for himself, his heirs and assigns, subject to the covenant and condition running with the land, and part of the consideration hereof, that no dwelling house or other building of any kind, shall ever be erected or placed on said lot within twenty feet of the line of California avenue, but that a space of twenty feet, as aforesaid, shall always be left open and clear of all buildings, or parts of buildings whatsoever\u201d; and then follows a provision authorizing any owner or owners of property located on the plan to proceed in any court of law or equity, by injunction or otherwise, to enforce the performance of the covenant or restrain its violation. On October 16, 1894, before the railways company acquired title, its grantor and other owners of lots in the same square entered into an agreement, which was duly recorded, changing the building line from twenty feet to a uniform distance of forty feet from the north line of California avenue. The bill filed by the complainant \u25a0was for an injunction to restrain the railways company from violating the building restriction imposed upon its lots. Its declared purpose, as found by the court below at the time this proceeding was instituted, was \u201cto grade said lots 39 and 40 to the approximate level of California avenue and Wynhurst street, and to place thereon, in the form of a loop, tracks over and along which cars may be operated and allowed to stand; said tracks to be laid on ties supported by ballast, and said cars to be operated in the usual manner, by the use of poles, wires and electricity.\u201d The grade to which the railways company proposed to reduce its lots is approximately eight feet below the natural elevation of them and the adjoining lots. The bill was dismissed on the ground that what the railways company proposed to do was not in violation of the building restriction. On appeal to the Superior Court this was reversed, and the bill was reinstated with a procedendo, that court having been of opinion that the proposed action of the railways company would be in violation of the restriction: Dewar v. Carson et al., 67 Pa. Superior Ct. 527. From this the railways company has appealed.\nWhile building restrictions are enforceable, they are not favored by the law, and covenants relating to them are not to be extended by implication: St. Andrew\u2019s Lutheran Church\u2019s App., 67 Pa. 512; Crofton v. St. Clement\u2019s Church, 208 Pa. 209; McCloskey v. Kirk, 243 Pa. 319. The error into which the learned court below fell was in holding that the covenant in the railways company\u2019s deed would be extended by implication if it' should be restrained from erecting or placing railroad tracks, rails, poles and ties on its lots. Under the pleadings and proofs, the question was not one of extending a covenant by implication, but was as to the meaning to be given to its express terms. The covenant in the railways company\u2019s deed, read in connection with the agreement of October 16, 1894, is that the space of forty feet north from the line of California avenue \u201cshall always be left open.\u201d These words are to be interpreted in the light of the manifest object or purpose of the parties in using them: Meigs v. Lewis, 164 Pa. 597; Landell et al. v. Hamilton et al., 175 Pa. 327; Murphy v. Ahlberg et al., 252 Pa. 267; and the meaning and extent of the building restriction which were within the contemplation of the parties at the time it was imposed must prevail.\nIn view of three findings of the court below, which were not excepted to there, and cannot, therefore, be disturbed here, clear error was committed in dismissing plaintiff\u2019s bill. After describing his lots and those of the defendant, the court proceeded to find as follows: \u201cBoth of said properties are in a residence district.\u201d \u201cIn said forty-foot strip upon said lot next the plaintiff\u2019s said property and commencing about seven or eight feet westwardly therefrom, the defendant, Pittsburgh Railways Company, proposes to install tracks (consisting of rails, ties and ballast), poles about twenty feet high above ground, and a system of wires for electric traction, together with street cars eleven to twelve feet high and forty-five feet long, which, with and without passengers, are to be hauled by said railways company over said tracks day and night and also stored thereon.\u201d \u201cBy means of the requirement that all buildings or parts of buildings shall be forty feet back from the street, the parties to said restriction, for themselves, their heirs and assigns, sought to protect and preserve the lots in said plan (including those now belonging to the parties to this suit), for residential purposes.\u201d The situation is thus concisely and aptly summed up by the learned president judge of the Superior Court: \u201cThe improvement contemplated by the defendants involves a material change of the surface grade, a permanent erection of solid materials, poles and wires, netted together to be used as a part of a general street system, and the occupancy of the surface tracks by cars in motion or at rest according to the will of the owner, and with such frequency as their business requires.\u201d To permit the railways company to install on the front of its lots \u201ctracks (consisting of rails, ties and ballast), poles about twenty feet high above ground, and a system of wires for electric traction, together with street cars eleven to twelve feet high and forty-five feet long, which, with and without passengers, are to be hauled by said railways company over \u25a0 said tracks day and night and also stored thereon,\u201d would defeat the very purpose of the building restriction, which, as found by the court below, was \u201cto protect and preserve the lots for residential purposes.\u201d This is too plain for further comment, and that portion of the lot shall, in the words of the covenant, \u201calways be left open,\u201d in the sense in which the parties to the covenant used them, \u201cto protect and preserve the lots for residential purposes.\u201d\nThe assignments of error on this appeal are overruled, and the decree of the Superior Court is affirmed, at the cost of the appellants."}
