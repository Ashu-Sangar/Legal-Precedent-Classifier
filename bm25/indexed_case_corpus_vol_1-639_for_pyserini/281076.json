{"id": "281076", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThis appeal raises the issue of whether the Commonwealth Court erred by concluding that there was insufficient evidence to support the termination of workers\u2019 compensation benefits. We reverse.\nOn June 17, 1991, Joseph Jordan, Appellee, suffered a lumbar disc injury during the course of his employment as a warehouse receiver for Consolidated Electrical Distributors, Inc. (Consolidated), Appellant. Pursuant to a notice of compensation payable, Jordan received total disability benefits. Jordan had previously sustained a work-related injury to his back in 1986 which required surgery in 1987.\nOn February 27, 1992, Consolidated filed a petition for termination. Several hearings were held where both parties introduced expert medical testimony. Consolidated presented the testimony of three medical experts. Thomas B. Benz, M.D., testified that Jordan complained of testicular pain, but that this pain was unrelated to his work-related back injury. Brian Emstoff, M.D., testified that he examined Jordan on four occasions and found no objective evidence of ongoing impairments. He further stated that Jordan was able to return to work without any restrictions. Physical therapist Leanne Darling testified that although Jordan complained of mild back discomfort during his work hardening program, the pain did not interfere with his ability to perform tasks.\nThe WCJ initially credited this testimony - and concluded that Jordan had completely recovered from his work-related back injury. He further concluded that Jordan\u2019s testicular pain was unrelated to the work injury. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Board) affirmed the termination of benefits, finding that sufficient evidence supported the WCJ\u2019s findings.\nThe Commonwealth Court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. The court subsequently granted reconsideration, vacated its prior order and reversed. Relying on Udvari v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (USAir), 667 A.2d 433 (Pa. Cmwlth.1995), the court found that although sufficient evidence supported the conclusion that Jordan\u2019s testicular pain was unrelated to his work injury, there was not sufficient evidence establishing that all of Jordan\u2019s work-related back injury had ceased. The court noted that a finding that Jordan could return to work without restrictions was not synonymous with a finding that his disability had ceased. Because Jordan\u2019s time-of-injury position was no longer available, the court found that a suspension of benefits was not appropriate. The court therefore reversed the termination order and remanded the case solely for the determination of costs.\nThe scope of appellate review in a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding is limited to determining whether constitutional rights were violated, whether an error of law was committed, or whether the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. Gumro v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 533 Pa. 461, 626 A.2d 94 (1993). Substantial evidence has been defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Bethenergy Mines, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 531 Pa. 287, 292, 612 A.2d 434, 436 (1992). In order to terminate benefits, the employer must establish that all disability related to a compensable injury has ceased. Pieper v. Ametek-Thermox Instruments Division, 526 Pa. 25, 584 A.2d 301 (1990).\nWe must determine whether the WCJ\u2019s finding that Jordan fully recovered from his work injury is supported by substantial evidence.\nConsolidated contends that sufficient evidence existed to support the termination of benefits because Dr. Ernstoff testified that there was no objective medical evidence of Jordan\u2019s pain and that he could return to work without restrictions. It argues that although Dr. Ernstoff testified regarding Jordan\u2019s complaints of pain, he did not opine that Jordan continued to suffer pain.\nWe discussed the effect of a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain in Udvari v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (USAir, Inc.), 550 Pa. 319, 705 A.2d 1290 (1997). In Udvari, the WCJ granted the termination petition based upon expert medical testimony establishing that the claimant had completely recovered from her work injury and no longer required treatment. The Commonwealth Court reversed on the grounds that the employer\u2019s physician testified regarding the claimant\u2019s continuing pain.\nOn appeal, we concluded that the employer\u2019s expert did not concede that the claimant continued to experience pain as a result of the work-related injury. Instead, he merely noted that he would give the claimant \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d that she believed she experienced some sort of pain. The expert clearly and unequivocally testified that the claimant was fully recovered, that there was no objective basis for her complaints and that he believed her symptoms were exaggerated. The WCJ\u2019s finding that she was fully recovered was therefore supported by substantial evidence. In reaching this conclusion we stated:\nThe determination of whether a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain are accepted is a question of fact for the WCJ. In the absence of objective medical testimony, the WCJ is neither required to accept the claimant\u2019s assertions, nor prohibited from doing so. Testimony by the employer\u2019s medical expert as to the existence of the claimant\u2019s complaints of pain does not require the WCJ to find for the claimant. A contrary conclusion would lead to the absurd result that a claimant could forever preclude the termination of benefits by merely complaining of continuing pain. What is relevant in deciding whether the termination of benefits is warranted is whether the claimant suffers from pain as a result of the work-related injury.\nWe must keep in mind that the employer bears the burden of proof in a termination proceeding to establish that the work injury has ceased. In a case where the claimant complains of continued pain, this burden is met when an employer\u2019s medical expert unequivocally testifies that it is his opinion, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the claimant is fully recovered, can return to work without restrictions and that there are no objective medical findings which either substantiate the claims of pain or connect them to the work injury.\nSlip op. at 7-8, 550 Pa. 327, 705 A.2d 1293 (citations omitted).\nHere, Dr. Ernstoff unequivocally testified that there were no objective medical findings to support Jordan\u2019s complaints of back pain and that he did not find evidence of any ongoing impairments. R. 181a, 195a. It is this testimony that the WCJ relied upon in terminating benefits. This constitutes sufficient evidence to support the finding that Jordan fully recovered from his work injury.\nThe Commonwealth Court instead relied upon the following emphasized portion of Dr. Ernstoffs testimony.\nQ. What were your findings on that examination?\nA. He [Jordan] had some complaints of ongoing to mild discomfort in his back. He had more complaints of some scrotal discomfort that he was having, which he had occasionally. And his physical exam was normal.\nQ. In your estimation do you believe that there was anything in your examination which would prevent Mr. Jordan from working in a nonrestrictive capacity in the work force?\nA. No.\n* * *\nQ. Again, Doctor, you have not found any objective evidence of ongoing impairments in this man, have you?\nA. No.\n\u2022K H\u00bb \u00abf\u00bb\nQ. In that context, against that background, what pain did he continue to express to you he had, the mild back discomfort back pain? Would you attribute that to the June 17,1991 work injury?\nA. He had previous back surgery, as you said. He was able to return to his previous level of function after that surgery. I would not attribute it specifically to that. I think it would be a combination of his previous back surgery, and his previous back injury that might have - been aggravated by this. But there were no objective findings that I had on my last evaluation.\nQ. If this were a strain situation, could he still be experiencing some level of pain without there being any positive objective symptoms?\nA. Sometimes, yes.\nQ. So in other words, your assessment of him as of that time, Doctor, he could go back and do his time-of-injury job?\nA. Sure.\nQ. But you\u2019re also, I think, recognizing that he had some level of pain for the reasons that you just explained; is that correct?\nA. He was still complaining of his back discomfort mildly, but yes.\nQ. You would at least attribute that to an aggravation of prior surgical\u2014\nA. He\u2019s had previous back problems, yes.\nSlip op. at 3-4, 550 Pa. 323-324, 705 A.2d 1291-92 (emphasis supplied).\nAs noted in Udvari, Dr. Emstoff s recognition of Jordan\u2019s complaints of pain are of no moment considering the fact that he found no evidence of any residual impairment. Moreover, his statement that Jordan\u2019s complaints of back pain \u201cmight have been aggravated by this\u201d is subject to various interpretations. The factfinder in a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding may accept the testimony of any witness in whole or in part. Hartner v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 146 Pa. Cmwlth. 167, 604 A.2d 1204 (1992), alloc. denied, 531 Pa. 662, 613 A.2d 1210 (1992). One sentence should not be extracted from Dr. Ernstoffs twenty-seven page deposition and relied upon to reverse the termination of benefits when his testimony viewed in its entirety supports the conclusion that Jordan is fully recovered. See Terek v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Somerset Welding & Steel, Inc.), 542 Pa. 453, 668 A.2d 131 (1995) (single phrase should not be extracted from deposition to conclude that opinion is equivocal).\nWe recognize that where a WCJ finds that the claimant continues to experience pain attributable to the work injury, the injury has not fully resolved and the termination of benefits is improper. Instead, the suspension of benefits may be appropriate if medical testimony establishes that the claimant can return to work despite the pain. However, here, the WCJ did not make a finding that Jordan continued to experience pain. The WCJ\u2019s findings were supported by substantial evidence and the Commonwealth Court erred in reversing the termination of benefits.\nAccordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed.\nNEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nCAPPY, J., files a dissenting opinion in which NIGRO, J., joins.\n. The Commonwealth Court also indicated that the employer's physician diagnosed the claimant with \"symptom magnification syndrome.\" Upon review of the testimony relating to such condition, we concluded that the term merely reflected the doctor\u2019s belief that the claimant was exaggerating her symptoms.\n. Dr. Ernstoff further testified that he did not see anything significant on an MRI that would cause any neural impingement which would result in pain. R. 194a.\n. In his dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Cappy relies on this statement in finding that Jordan continued to suffer pain. To the contrary. Dr. Emstoff clearly stated that Jordan was still \"complaining of his back discomfort.\""}
