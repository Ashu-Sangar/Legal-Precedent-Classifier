{"id": "1884575", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nOn September 25, 1962, a special referendum election pursuant to the Optional Third Class City Charter Law (Act of July 15,1957, P. L. 901, 53 P.S. \u00a741101 et seq.) was held in the City of Reading, Pennsylvania, to determine whether or not a Council-Manager Plan of government should be adopted in that city. Paper ballots were used to submit the question to the electorate and more than 28,000 votes were cast. The final result, as indicated by the open returns, gave a plurality of 99 votes against the adoption of the plan.\nSubsequently, petitions were filed with the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County to recount the ballots contained in forty-one election boxes. During the recount proceedings, challenges were recorded by parties in interest to the validity of a total of 431 ballots. The challenges all concerned the manner in which the ballots involved were marked by the voter in casting his or her vote on the question. No fraud was involved. The rulings of the court with respect to the validity of a certain number of these ballots resulted in a plurality of 26 votes in favor of the adoption of the plan.\nThis appeal challenges the legal correctness of the lower court\u2019s ruling declaring that certain ballots were void and should not be counted in the final tabulation of the vote.\nEach ballot contained the following question: \u201cShall the Council-Manager Plan of the Optional Third Class City Charter Law, providing for seven (7) Councilmen to be elected at large, be adopted by the City of Reading\u201d ?\nOpposite the above question were two double blocks or squares, one above the other. The upper left square contained the printed word \u201cYes\u201d and the lower left square contained the printed word \u201cNo.\u201d Immediately adjacent to these squares were blank squares wherein the voter could indicate Ms or her vote. On each ballot specific instructions were printed to guide the voter in casting the ballot. These included the following: \u201cUse either a cross (X) or a check (V) mark.\u201d The instructions did not specifically indicate where the cross (X) or check (V) mark should be placed on the ballot.\nIt is our considered conclusion that the court below erred in ruling certain specific ballots invalid. These may be classified into two categories: 1. Those wherein the voter inserted a cross (X) or a check (V) mark in the proper voting square but in addition thereto added the word \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d in writing in the same square; 2. Those wherein the voter inserted a cross (X) or a check (V) mark in the proper voting square and in addition thereto inserted another cross (X) or check (V) mark in the square containing the printed word \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo.\u201d\nWhen the ballots in the foregoing two categories are counted, as they should be, the final result of the election will be changed. In Category 1, 45 ballots, which the court invalidated, are involved, 34 \u201cNo\u201d and 11 \u201cYes.\u201d In Category 2, 11 ballots were declared invalid, 10 \u201cNo\u201d and 1 \u201cYes.\u201d\nOn the question of the validity of the ballots involved the cases of Norwood Election Contest Case, 382 Pa. 547, 116 A. 2d 552 (1955); James Appeal, 377 Pa. 405, 105 A. 2d 64 (1954) and Bauman Election Contest Case, 351 Pa. 451, 41 A. 2d 630 (1945), are controlling.\nThe pertinent section of the Election Code, as recently amended, provides as follows : \u201cAny ballot marked by any other mark than an (X) or a (V) in the spaces provided for that purpose shall be void.\u201d In Norwood, supra, this Court in construing this provision unanimously ruled that where the voter placed a check (V) mark in addition to a cross (X) in the square opposite a candidate\u2019s name on the election ballot, that this irregularity did not render the ballot void. As of that date the marking of a ballot by a check (V) mark was not permitted. It was the amendments to the code, by the Act of January 8, 1960, P. L. (1959) 2142, 25 P.S. \u00a73063(a), that first permitted the use of a check (V) mark. In fact the code in effect as of the date of the Norwood decision provided: \u201cAny ballot marked by any other mark than an (X) in the space provided for that purpose shall be void and not counted.\u201d As enunciated in the Norwood case, the power to throw out a ballot for minor irregularities should be sparingly used. It should be done only for very compelling reasons. Again, in Bauman, supra, we said at page 456: \u201cMarking a ballot in voting is a matter not of precision engineering bnt of an unmistakable registration of the voter\u2019s will in substantial conformity to statutory requirements.\u201d\nIn the instant case, the voters, on the ballots under discussion, unmistakably indicated their preferences and voted on the question by a proper mark in the proper square. The additions were mere surplusage. To say that the minor irregularities rendered the votes void, would disenfranchise these votes for very picayune reasons. In this connection it is noted that in the printed instructions on the ballot it did not say, USE A CROSS (X) OR A CHECK (V) ONLY.\nNor may the additional insertions on the ballots concerned possibly be construed to constitute identification marks. The provision in the code in respect to this subject must be construed. with great liberality: Bauman Election Contest Case, supra. In that case, a voter inserted a cross (X) in the proper square and added a horizontal line through the (X). In two other instances, voters inserted check (V) marks as well as the cross (X) in the voting square. It was held that these additional marks did not void the ballots. Certainly, the additional insertion of a horizontal line through a cross (X) is much more susceptible to identification than the additions involved herein. See also, McCaffreys\u2019 Appeals, 337 Pa. 552, 11 A. 2d 893 (1940), wherein it was said at page 559: \u201c[N]ot every mark which may separate and distinguish a ballot will necessarily result in a declaration of invalidity, but only such marks as cannot be reasonably supposed to have been made by the voter except for the very purpose of distinguishing his ballot and which are appropriate to that end.\u201d It appears unreasonable to us to say that the additions involved herein were for identification purposes, when such a large number of ballots were challenged for substantially the same reasons, and the inadequacies in the ballot instructions coincided with the reasons for the challenged votes.\nFinally, in this connection we note the following significant finding and conclusion of the court below, \u201cWe are completely satisfied. . . that such errors as were discovered are not toilful errors.\u2019\u2019 This completely negates the fact that the marks were placed on the ballots by the voters for the purpose of identifying their ballots. That the voter placed the marks thereon for this purpose is basic to the conclusion that they were in fact identifying marks. See, McCaffreys\u2019 Appeals, supra.\nThe lower court reluctantly further concluded that the additional mark on the ballots referred to in Category 2, supra, constituted an erasure or mutilation of the ballot in the voting square, thereby rendering the vote void. With this conclusion, we do not agree.\nThe main contention of counsel for appellee is that the amendment to the code by the Act of 1960, supra, in effect overruled the decisions of this Court previously cited herein, and constituted a clear expression of legislative intent that from the date of that enactment, a voter had to mark the ballot with an (X) or a (V) mark and nothing more. We do not so interpret the Act of 1960. The pertinent words involved which constituted an addition to the Act of 1937, supra, are as follows: \u201cProvided, That all markings on the ballot are made by the same pen or pencil and that all markings on the ballot are the same type of marking either a cross (X) or check (V)-\u201d This provision does not refer to the situations involved. It said and said only that a ballot shall be marked with the same markings throughout and with the same pen or pencil. It did not say that any additional minor insertions would nullify a ballot. If the legislature intended to overrule Norwood, Bauman and James, supra, language could easily have been set forth giving such expression.\nIn conclusion, a change in the form of the government in the City of Reading may or may not be advisable, but if such is to be accomplished, let it be done by the will of the electorate and in accordance with law.\nThe order of the court below is reversed and it is directed that a final and corrected order be entered consonant with this opinion.\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones dissents.\nAct of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, as amended (25 P.S. \u00a73063 (a)).\nFor a similar factual situation, see Bauman Election Contest Case, supra.\nEmphasis supplied."}
