{"id": "1825977", "contents": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nIn this appeal we are presented with the issue of whether a trial court may, during sentencing, change a previously rendered verdict of guilty to one of not guilty.\nAppellant, Lawrence Stark, was charged with the crimes of terroristic threats and simple assault. At the close of the evidence at appellant\u2019s bench trial, the following exchange took place:\nTHE COURT: All right. Bring the defendant forward. THE DEFENDANT: Sir, can I say something?\nTHE COURT: I think you better talk through your counsel. That\u2019s the way I operate in this courtroom.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I was trying to, sir.\nTHE COURT: You better talk to her, and whatever she wants to relate to the Court she will.\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, Mr. Stark has indicated that he wishes to \u2014 he still wanted to have [a witness] to testify on his behalf, and he will corroborate\u2014\nTHE COURT: All right. We\u2019ll set the bond at $10,000 straight, and we\u2019ll continue the case until he finds his witness; all right? Bring the sheriff in to take him down. We\u2019ll continue it. We\u2019ll give him a date. The bond is $10,000 straight. You\u2019re looking at a probation case. If you want to play games, we\u2019ll continue the case until you find the witness. You\u2019re a big boy. What are you crying for now?\nTHE DEFENDANT: They really jumped me sir.\nTHE COURT: You don\u2019t have the right to go get a knife sir. There\u2019s no justification for that. Either you want to abide by my decision, or we\u2019ll grant you a postponement.\nTHE DEFENDANT: I\u2019ll abide by your decision.\nTHE COURT: All right, I find you guilty as to Count One [terroristic threats] and not guilty as to Count Two [simple assault]. You\u2019re filing postverdict motions, or do you want to waive that and proceed directly to sentencing? This is a probation case.\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor. Your Honor, the District Attorney is asking for a deadly weapons enhancement\u2014\nTHE COURT: He\u2019s not going to get it. I only found him guilty of terroristic threats.\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: We would proceed today Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: All right. What\u2019s the Commonwealth have in terms of sentencing?\n[ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY]: Your Honor, the prior record score is 13. It\u2019s based on four prior burglaries.\nTHE COURT: You can\u2019t have a prior record score of 13.\n[ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY]: Well it\u2019s six because that\u2019s the highest you can go. Otherwise it would be a 13.\nTHE COURT: Don\u2019t fabricate something for the Court. This is a case that probably should have been settled at the Magistrate\u2019s office; all right? You\u2019re wasting a lot of time and\u2019money, the citizens\u2019 money for these kind of cases that should have been resolved at the Magistrate\u2019s level.\n[ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY]: He has four pri- or burglaries, receiving stolen property as a felony, in addition a felony for forgery, in addition a drunk driving. The guidelines would be \u2014 with the prior record score of six, on the terroristic threats the offense gravity score is a three, a three with a six. He has four to eight months in the mitigated range, eight to twelve in the standard range. Aggravated is 12 to 18, and according to the legislature of Pennsylvania, it says that the sentence of 12 months to 24 months must be added to those ranges when a deadly weapon is used.\nTHE COURT: You\u2019re asking for a directed verdict? Not guilty; all right? If you want to play that game, not guilty; okay? Don\u2019t play games with me.\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Thank You, Your Honor.\n(N.T. 10/8/87 at pp. 34-37)\nAs this transcript shows, the verdict of guilty of terroristic threats was changed, during appellant\u2019s sentencing, to one of not guilty. Pa.R.Crim.P. 1102(a), provides: \u201cWhen a defendant waives a jury trial, the trial judge shall determine all questions of law and fact and render a verdict which shall have the same force and effect as a verdict of a jury.\u201d This rule restricts the trial judge\u2019s authority over the verdict in a nonjury trial to one which is no greater than his or her authority over a jury verdict, Commonwealth v. Meadows, 471 Pa. 201, 369 A.2d 1266 (1977), and the authority of a trial judge over a jury verdict is limited to consideration of postverdict motions in arrest of judgment or the granting of a new trial. (The grant of a new trial is not at issue herein). Commonwealth v. Parker, 305 Pa.Super. 516, 451 A.2d 767 (1982).\nBoth the trial court and Superior Court characterized the trial court\u2019s decision to change appellant\u2019s verdict as a sua sponte grant of a motion in arrest of judgment. It is well settled that only causes appearing on the face of the record or insufficiency of the evidence will justify the grant of a motion in arrest of judgment. Commonwealth v. Jackson, 223 Pa.Super. 497, 302 A.2d 420 (1973). Causes appearing on the face of the record include such fundamental defects as lack of jurisdiction, former jeopardy or failure of an indictment or information to charge an offense. Commonwealth v. Schomaker, 293 Pa.Super. 78, 437 A.2d 999 (1981), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 501 Pa. 404, 461 A.2d 1220 (1983).\nSince the record reveals that the trial judge changed this verdict for reasons unrelated to the sufficiency of the evidence or causes appearing on the face of the record, it is clear that this decision by the trial court was not a grant of a motion in arrest of judgment. In changing appellant\u2019s verdict, the trial judge went beyond the authority which a trial judge may properly exercise over a verdict. Discomfort by a trial judge during a sentencing proceeding over the prospect of ordering confinement does not form a basis for any authorized action by that trial judge. The verdict of not guilty, therefore, was a legal nullity. Accordingly, the order of Superior Court, 389 Pa.Super. 654, 560 A.2d 830, reinstating the original verdict and remanding the case for sentencing is affirmed.\nOrder affirmed.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2706 and 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2701(a)(1), respectively.\n. Although the instant verdict was changed before it was recorded, for present purposes, we deem the unrecorded verdict of guilty to have the effect of a recorded verdict since the trial court impliedly accorded the guilty verdict the status of a recorded verdict when it permitted appellant to waive his postverdict motions (which can only be filed after the verdict is recorded) and to proceed directly to sentencing.\n. We do agree, however, with Superior Court that the evidence was sufficient to sustain the verdict of guilty.\n. Since the verdict of not guilty was a legal nullity, the absolute finality afforded a verdict of not guilty under the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply in this situation."}
