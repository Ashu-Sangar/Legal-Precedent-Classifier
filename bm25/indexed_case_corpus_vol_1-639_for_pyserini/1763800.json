{"id": "1763800", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nUnder section 3732 of the Vehicle Code,\n\u201cAny person who unintentionally causes the death of another person while engaged in the violation of any law of this Commonwealth or municipal ordinance applying to the operation or use of a vehicle or to the regulation of traffic is guilty of homicide by vehicle, a misdemeanor of the first degree, when the violation is the cause of death.\u201d\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3732. On this pre-trial appeal, the Commonwealth seeks reversal of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Warren County holding section 3732 unconstitutionally vague. We agree with the Commonwealth that the court of common pleas erred in so holding and remand with instructions.\nOn the evening of August 22, 1978, appellee Michael Burt and a few other people were at a campsite near Titusville, Pennsylvania. Two friends of appellee, Joseph Miller and Carrie O\u2019Connor, asked appellee to take them for a ride in his new \u201cDatsun 240Z.\u201d Appellee agreed and the three left the campsite in the vehicle, appellee driving, Miller sitting in the passenger seat, and O\u2019Connor sitting in the cargo area. Appellee drove the vehicle on a dirt road for a few hundred yards. He then turned onto a macadam road, which he drove on for about one mile. Upon reaching the point where the macadam road ended and another dirt road began, appellee turned his car around and began to return on the macadam road.\nAs he returned, appellee came upon a right-hand curve in the road. As appellee started to negotiate the curve, Miller cautioned appellee to slow down. The right front tire of the car, however, tipped the berm. This in turn threw the vehicle across to the left and off the road. The car travelled approximately 180 feet from the roadway, hit a large tree, travelled another forty-five feet, and hit a barbed-wire fence. The vehicle then flipped end over end a couple of times, coming to rest upside down. Neither appellee nor Miller was seriously injured. O\u2019Connor, however, who had been thrown out of the vehicle, was killed.\nAppellee told investigating State Trooper John Herzog that he \u201cwas coming down the road, hit the gravel and lost control. . . . \u201d Miller allegedly told Herzog that at the time of the accident appellee was travelling at an excessive speed. Herzog filed a complaint charging appellee with the summary offenses of failure to drive on the right side of the roadway and reckless driving, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3301 & 3714, and the first-degree misdemeanor offense of homicide by vehicle, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3732. As to the homicide by vehicle charge, the subsequent information specified that appellee did\n\u201crecklessly cause the death of Carrie O\u2019Connor while engaged in the violation of the vehicle code of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to-wit, reckless driving and failure to drive on the right side of the highway, and that said violations were the cause of the death of the victim.\u201d\nAfter a preliminary hearing, appellee was bound over on all three charges.\nAppellee then made a pre-trial motion to dismiss the charge of homicide by vehicle on the ground of vagueness. After argument, the court granted the motion. The court agreed with appellee that section 3732 both leaves a vehicle operator without reasonable notice of what acts are prohibited and permits arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The court also concluded section 3732 imposes \u201cabsolute liability\u201d and thus appellee is not \u201cprotected from being caught in the . . . net by the necessity of having a specific intent to commit the unlawful act.\u201d Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 163, 92 S.Ct. 839, 843, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972). This appeal followed.\nIt is a fundamental principle of due process that \u201ca criminal statute \u2018that fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is\nforbidden by the statute,\u2019 United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 812, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954), or is so indefinite that \u2018it encourages arbitrary and erratic arrests and convictions,\u2019 Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 162, 92 S.Ct. 839, 843, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972), is void for vagueness. See generally Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2298-2299, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972).\u201d\nColautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S. 379, 390, 99 S.Ct. 675, 683, 58 L.Ed.2d 596 (1979). At the same time, however,\n\u201c \u2018The fact that [the legislature] might without difficulty have chosen \u201cclear and more precise language\u201d equally capable of achieving the end which it sought does not mean that the statute which is in fact drafted is unconstitutionally vague.\u2019 United States v. Powell, 423 U.S. 87, 94, 96 S.Ct. 316, 320, 46 L.Ed.2d 228, 235 (1975). Rather, the requirements of due process are satisfied if the statute in question contains reasonable standards to guide the prospective conduct.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Heinbaugh, 467 Pa. 1, 6, 354 A.2d 244, 246 (1976). Here it is clear that section 3732 contains entirely reasonable standards. With unmistakable clarity, section 3732 defines \u201chomicide by vehicle\u201d as a death caused by any person\u2019s conduct violating law or municipal ordinance applying to vehicles or traffic regulation. This section does not employ \u201cambiguous\u201d words, \u201carchaic classifications,\u201d or words with \u201cnumerous and varied\u201d meanings. Compare Colautti v. Franklin, supra (\u201cviability\u201d determination requirement of statute regulating physicians\u2019 performance of abortions void), Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, supra (\u201cvagrancy\u201d ordinance drafted in terms of archaic English poor laws invalid), and Lanzetta v. State of New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 59 S.Ct. 618, 83 L.Ed. 888 (1939) (voiding statute making it crime to be member of \u201cgang\u201d). Accordingly, any vagueness challenge must be rejected. See United States ex rel. Almeida v. Rundle, 383 F.2d 421, 426 (3d Cir. 1967) (upholding former felony-murder statute).\n\" Order of the court of common pleas reversed, count charging homicide by vehicle reinstated and case remanded for further appropriate proceedings.\n. We hear this pre-trial appeal pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 722(7), which gives this Court exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final orders of the courts of common pleas in cases where \u201cany statute\u201d of the Commonwealth \u201chas been held invalid as repugnant to the Constitution ... of the United States\u201d or \u201cConstitution of this Commonwealth.\u201d See generally Commonwealth v. Meyer, 488 Pa. 297, 412 A.2d 517 (1980).\n. Section 3301 provides:\n\u201cDriving on right side of roadway\n(a) General rule. \u2014 Upon all roadways of sufficient width, a vehicle shall be driven upon the right half of the roadway except as follows:\n(1) When overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction where permitted by the rules governing such movement.\n(2) When an obstruction exists making it necessary to drive to the left of the center of the roadway, provided the driver yields the right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the unobstructed portion of the roadway within such distance as to constitute a hazard.\n(3) When and where official traffic-control devices are in place designating a lane or lanes to the left side of the center of the roadway for the movement indicated by the devices.\n(4) Upon a roadway restricted to one-way traffic.\n(5) When making a left turn as provided in sections 3322 (relating to vehicle turning left) and 3331 (relating to required position and method of turning).\n(b) Vehicle proceeding at less than normal speed. \u2014 Upon all roadways any vehicle proceeding at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing shall be driven in the right-hand lane then available for traffic, or as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway, except when overtaking and passing another vehicle proceeding in the same direction or when preparing for a left turn at an intersection or into an alley, private road or driveway. This subsection does not apply to a driver who must necessarily drive in a lane other than the right-hand lane to continue on his intended route.\u201d\nSection 3714 provides:\n\u201cReckless driving\nAny person who drives a vehicle in careless disregard for the safety of persons or property is guilty of reckless driving, a summary offense.\u201d\nSection 6502 provides:\n\u201cSummary offenses\n(a) Designation. \u2014 It is a summary offense for any person to violate any of the provisions of this title unless the violation is by this title or other statute of this Commonwealth declared to be a misdemeanor or felony.\n(b) Penalty. \u2014 Every person convicted of a summary offense for a violation of any of the provisions of this title for which another penalty is not provided shall be sentenced to pay a fine of $25.\n(c) Title 18 inapplicable. \u2014 Title 18 (relating to crimes and offenses), in so far as it relates to fines and imprisonment for convictions of summary offenses, is not applicable to this title.\u201d\n. See also Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 101, 65 S.Ct. 1031, 1035, 89 L.Ed. 1495 (1945) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[t]he requirement of a specific intent to do a prohibited act may avoid those consequences to the accused which may otherwise render a vague or indefinite statute invalid\u201d). The court did not hold, and appellee does not separately contend, that even if section 3732 is not vague, it improperly imposes absolute liability.\n. Appellee waived his prompt trial rights under the 180-day rule of Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 1100(a)(2) upon filing his motion to dismiss. The Commonwealth sought and obtained an extension of time in which to commence trial pursuant to Rule 1100(c) upon filing its appeal.\n. No claim is made that constitutionally protected conduct is reached by the statute. Thus, this vagueness challenge \u201cmust be examined in the light of the facts of the case at hand.\u201d United States v. Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 550, 95 S.Ct. 710, 714, 42 L.Ed.2d 706 (1975).
