{"id": "1051857", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal is from a decree of distribution, and complains of the allowance of certain claims against the estate of the decedent. Though there are thirty-seven assignments of error, no one of them is to the final decree of the court below confirming absolutely the report of the auditor. It cannot, therefore, be disturbed: Fulmer\u2019s Est., 243 Pa. 226.\nAppeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
