{"id": "972603", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThe learned judge below declined to affirm the defendant\u2019s point, and submitted the question of negligence to the jury. He could not properly have done otherwise. It was for the jury to say whether the plaintiff was guilty of negligence in not moving the ladder, and whether the defendant company was negligent in not having the brace secured. These were questions which, under the evidence, the jury had a right to pass upon.\nJudgment affirmed."}
