{"id": "870727", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nOne of the grounds on which the learned judges of the court below set aside the report of the viewers and dismissed appellant\u2019s petition, is, that \u201c the act of assembly of June 6, 1893, under which the view was had is. unconstitutional.\u201d In that conclusion, they were clearly right for the second reason given by them in support thereof, viz: that the act in question is local and special and therefore unconstitutional. They further say : \u201c It is special legislation in the guise of a general law\u2014 the most specious and vicious form that special legislation' can assume.\u201d\nIt requires neither argument nor citation of authorities to show that the reason thus assigned for declaring the act unconstitutional is both sound and conclusive. We express no opinion as to other reasons urged in support of the decree.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant."}
