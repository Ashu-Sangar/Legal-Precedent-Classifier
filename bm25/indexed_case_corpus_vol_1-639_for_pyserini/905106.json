{"id": "905106", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe find nothing in this case that would have justified the court below in taking off the judgment of nonsuit. For reasons given by the learned trial judge, he was clearly right \u201c in refusing to admit in evidence the policy of insurance upon which suit was brought,\u201d as set forth in the second specification. The evidence covered by the bill of exceptions is wholly insufficient to justify the submission of plaintiff\u2019s claim to a jury.\nJudgment affirmed."}
