{"id": "1787774", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nAppellant Robert Perkins was convicted in a non-jury trial of voluntary manslaughter, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2503, and possession of an instrument of crime, generally, 18 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 907. Post-verdict motions were denied and judgment of sentence was entered on January 22, 1980. This direct appeal followed.\nAppellant asserts that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict of guilty of voluntary manslaughter and to negate the appellant\u2019s evidence of self-defense, Commonwealth v. Cropper, 463 Pa. 529, 345 A.2d 645 (1975). Appellant also alleges error in the court\u2019s determination that appellant violated a duty to retreat. Additionally, appellant argues that the trial court\u2019s opinion evidences an application of erroneous standards by the court in reaching the verdict. We have reviewed these claims and find them to be without merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nThis appeal arose under this Court\u2019s former jurisdiction over all \"felonious homicide\u201d pursuant to the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722(1) as amended by Act of April 28, 1978, P.L. 202, No. 53, \u00a7 10(4), since superseded by Acts of Sept. 23, 1980, P.L. 686, No. 137, \u00a7 1, and Oct. 5, 1980, P.L. \u00a7 693, No. 142, \u00a7 216(c)."}
