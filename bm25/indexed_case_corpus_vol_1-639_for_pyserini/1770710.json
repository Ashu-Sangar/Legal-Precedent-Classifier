J., filed an Opinion in Support of Affirmance in which ROBERTS and FLAHERTY, JJ., join.\nNIX, J., filed an Opinion in Support of Reversal.\nLARSEN, J., filed an Opinion in Support of Reversal in which KAUFFMAN, J., joined.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMANCE\nO\u2019BRIEN, Chief Justice.\nThis appeal is from an order of the Superior Court, affirming an order of the Court of Common Pleas, Lehigh County, which granted a demurrer of appellee, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, to the complaint of appellant, Elizabeth Midboe, on behalf of herself and others similarly situated.\nOn December 18, 1976, appellant\u2019s son, Carl Midboe, an eighteen-year-old high school senior, was killed in an automobile accident. Appellant filed a claim with appellee for \u201csurvivor\u2019s loss\u201d benefits under her No-Fault insurance policy. Appellee refused payment on the claim because appellant was not dependent upon the deceased for support at the time of his death. Appellant then filed a class action on her behalf and for others similarly situated, alleging that the insurance policies in question were in contravention of the expressed intention of the Legislature which passed the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act. Appellant thus sought reformation of the applicable insurance policies for both her and all the members of the class. Appellee filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to the complaint and also alleged that the complaint was not a proper class action. The Court of Common Pleas, Lehigh County, sustained appellee\u2019s demurrer and, because of that disposition, did not rule on the propriety of the class action. The Superior Court affirmed. Midboe v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 261 Pa.Super. 447, 395 A.2d 991 (1978). This Court granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal and this appeal followed.\nThe sole issue presented instantly is one of statutory interpretation. The No-Fault Act provides:\n\u201c \u2018Survivor\u2019 means:\n\u201c(A) spouse; or\n\u201c(B) child, parent, brother, sister or relative dependent upon the deceased for support.\u201d 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.103 (Supp. 1980-81).\nA determination must be made whether the phrase \u201cdependent upon the deceased for support\u201d modifies only \u201crelative\u201d or whether that phrase modifies all of the antecedents contained in subsection (B). Appellant admitted in her original complaint that at the time of her son\u2019s death she was not dependent upon her son for support. Appellant, however, argues that a child, parent, brother or sister need not show such dependency. Appellant further admits that under the definition of \u201csurvivor\u201d contained in her insurance policy with State Farm, she does not qualify as a \u201csurvivor\u201d. The policy states:\n\u201cSurvivor means:\n\u201c(1) a spouse;\n\u201c(2) a child, parent, brother, sister or relative who was dependent on the insured at the time of the insured's death.\u201d (emphasis in original).\nAppellant argues that the definition of survivor contained in the policy is contrary to the definition of survivor intended by the Legislature in the No-Fault Act. As appellant believes that no limitations on coverage may be imposed by State Farm or other insurance companies that are not authorized by the No-Fault Act, and since appellant believes that State Farm\u2019s definition is such a limitation, she argues that the policy must be reformed to define survivor as the Legislature, in her view, intended.\nThe Legislature has codified the primary rule of statutory construction, stating:\n\u201cThe object of all interpretation and Construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d\nAct of November 25, 1970, P. L. 707, No. 230, repealed and reenacted, Act of December 6, 1972, P. L. 1339, No. 290, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a). This rule, however, is oft easier to state than to apply; as a result, the Statutory Construction Act and other principles of statutory construction must be utilized to ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent.\nAppellant advances several reasons, some of which are based on the Statutory Construction Act, why her perception of the Legislature\u2019s intention should be adopted. While the arguments are well made, I nonetheless believe the Legislature intended that a child, parent, brother or sister, as well as any other relative, must establish dependency on the deceased to qualify as a survivor under the No-Fault Act.\nAppellant argues that the survivor\u2019s benefits under the No-Fault Act were intended to parallel survivor\u2019s loss in the Wrongful Death and Survival statutes. Appellant believes that a plaintiff suing under either of those two statutes need not establish dependency on the deceased as a predicate to recovery; thus, if the No-Fault Act were intended to parallel those actions, appellant asserts that she, as the deceased\u2019s mother, need not prove such dependency. I, however, disagree.\nTo a certain extent, appellant is correct in her assertion that a plaintiff suing under the traditional Wrongful Death or Survival statutes need not establish dependency on the deceased to recover. It is clear that dependency on the deceased need not be shown in a survival action because of the very nature of that action, i. e., a suit which the deceased would have brought had he survived. Damages in a survival action are thus:\n\u201c.. . to be measured by the decedent\u2019s pain and suffering and loss of gross earning power from the date of injury until death, and loss of earning power less personal maintenance expenses from the time of death through decedent\u2019s estimated working lifespan.\u201d\nIncollingo v. Ewing, 444 Pa. 299, 309, 282 A.2d 206, 229 (1971).\nDependency on the deceased is simply not an issue in a survival action.\nA wrongful death action is another matter, for in some respects dependency on the deceased is not a predicate t\u00f3 recovery; in other respects, however, such dependency must be shown.\n\u201cRecovery under the Wrongful Death Act, which runs in favor of statutory beneficiaries, consists of funeral and medical expenses plus compensation for pecuniary losses suffered by reason of the decedent\u2019s death.\u201d\nSoares v. McClosky, 466 F.Supp. 703, 708 (E.D.Pa.1979) (emphasis added). Pecuniary loss has been defined as:\n\u201c \u2018. . . the destruction of a reasonable expectation of pecuniary advantage from the deceased. It is not a matter of guess or conjecture, but must be based upon facts showing the contributions which the deceased made during his lifetime and facts upon which the jury can base an esti mate of the probable contributions he would have made for the balance of his natural life.\u2019 Cromley v. Speich, 19 F.Supp. 857 (M.D.Pa.1937); aff\u2019d 94 F.2d 543 (3rd Cir., 1938).\u201d\nGatenby v. Altoona Aviation Corp., 277 F.Supp. 1011, 1013 (W.D.Pa.1968).\nThus, even under traditional wrongful death recovery, the plaintiff was required to show actual dependency on the deceased to recover that portion of damages which has been defined as pecuniary loss. Further, appellant is unable to point to any mention in the No-Fault Act that the Act was intended to parallel the Wrongful Death or Survival Acts. Even if, however, such intention were crystal clear, the result would not be different as dependency on the deceased had to be proven to recover a portion of damages under the Wrongful Death Act.\nAppellant next argues that the No-Fault Act would be internally inconsistent if her interpretation of \u201csurvivor\u201d is not adopted. Appellant points to the Act\u2019s definition of \u201csurvivor\u2019s loss\u201d which defines that term as:\n\u201c(A) loss of income of a deceased victim which would probably have been contributed to a survivor or survivors, if the victim had not sustained the fatal injury; and \u201c(B) expenses reasonably incurred by the survivor or survivors, after the victim\u2019s death resulting from injury, in obtaining ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those which the victim would have performed, not for income, but for their benefit, if he had not sustained the fatal injury, reduced by expenses which the survivor or survivors would probably have incurred but avoided by reason of the victim\u2019s death resulting from the injury.\u201d 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.103 (Supp. 1980-81).\nAppellant\u2019s argument is that simply because one is a child, parent, brother or sister, it is reasonable to assume that the deceased would probably have contributed some support to those persons. I believe, however, that appellant misconstrues the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cprobably\u201d, and accepting her interpretation would amount to awarding damages on the basis of pure speculation. As a recent treatise on the No-Fault Act states:\n\u201cSurvivor\u2019s loss is not life insurance; it is a species of basic loss benefits which depend upon a showing of financial loss.\u201d\nD. Shrager, The Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Insurance Act, 101 (1979) (emphasis added), (footnote omitted).\nAlong the same lines, appellant argues that where an inconsistency exists, the Statutory Construction Act requires that specific provisions must control over the inconsistent general provisions. See, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1933. Appellant argues that the general definition of \u201csurvivor\u201d (assuming that a child, parent, brother and sister must establish dependency on the deceased) is in conflict with the specific definition of \u201csurvivor\u2019s loss\u201d and thus, the latter must prevail. As already noted, however, I perceive no conflict or inconsistency between the two provisions and appellant\u2019s argument must thus be rejected.\nAppellant next argues that another rule of statutory construction compels that her interpretation of \u201csurvivor\u201d be adopted. That rule provides:\n\u201c. . . all phrases and sentences are to be construed according to the rules of grammar; and these \u2018require as a general thing, a limiting clause or phrase, following several expressions to which it might be applicable, to be restrained to the last antecedent\u2019: Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, secs. 2 and 414.\u201d\nBuntz v. General American Life Insurance Co., 136 Pa.Super. 284, 289, 7 A.2d 93, 95 (1939). Thus, applying this rule, appellant argues that \u201cdependent on the deceased for support\u201d modifies only \u201crelative\u201d and not \u201cchild, parent, brother or sister\u201d. In discussing the \u201clast antecedent\u201d rule, this Court has stated:\n\u201cThe [last antecedent] rule is but another aid to discovery of intent or meaning, however, and not an inflexible and uniformly binding rule. Where the sense of the entire act requires that a qualifying word or phrase apply to several preceding or even succeeding sections, the word or phrase will not be restricted to its immediate antecedent. . . . When several words are followed by a [modifying phrase] which is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the [modifying phrase] be read as applicable to all.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Rosenbloom Finance Corp., 457 Pa. 496, 500, 325 A.2d 907, 909 (1974), citing, C. Sands, 2A Sutherland\u2019s Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.33 (4th ed. 1973). I believe the above-quoted portion of Rosenbloom Finance is especially applicable in the instant case, for if the Legislature had intended that only \u201crelative\u201d need prove dependency on the deceased, it could have included \u201cchild, parent, brother or sister\u201d in subsection (A) with \u201cspouse\u201d.\nAppellant next points to a proposed regulation of the Insurance Commissioner, which she believes supports her contention that a parent of a deceased victim need not establish dependency on the deceased. The original regulation defined a \u201csurvivor\u201d as:\n\u201cA spouse, or any of the following dependent upon the deceased for his or her support at the time of death: child, parent, brother, sister, or other relative.\u201d\n31 Pa.Code \u00a7 66.1-103. The proposed regulation relied upon by appellant, states:\n\u201cThe above-mentioned definition of \u2018survivor\u2019 in \u00a7 66.-2(A) contains a limitation on \u2018survivor\u2019s loss\u2019 which is not contained in \u00a7 103, Definitions, Survivor, that is:\n\u201c(1) Requiring a showing of dependency at time of death of the insured for a child, parent, brother, sister or relative.\n\u201cSubsection I of conditions of \u00a7 66.2(A) provides that regardless of the language of the No-Fault Endorsement, coverage shall be in accordance with the No-Fault Act. Therefore, the definition of \u2018survivor\u2019 in \u00a7 103, Definitions of the No-Fault Act [40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.103] controls. Dependency may be determined at the time of death but a showing of dependency at the time of death is not necessary.\u201d\nPennsylvania Bulletin, Vol. 8, No. 12, March 25, 1978. Most importantly, as appellee points out, the proposed regulation has never been adopted and made part of the Pennsylvania Code. Further, even if in effect, the new regulation could be read to mean that while a showing of dependency at the time of death is not necessary, a showing of dependency at some time prior to death is still required. Appellant\u2019s argument must thus be rejected.\nAppellant next points to the No-Fault Act itself which states:\n\u201cTherefore, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the General Assembly to establish at reasonable cost to the purchaser of insurance, a Statewide system of prompt and adequate basic loss benefits for motor vehicle accident victims and the survivors of deceased victims.\u201d\n40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.102(b). (Supp.1980-81). Appellant argues that if a parent must establish dependency on the deceased, the Act is not humane, prompt and adequate. I disagree. The purpose of the No-Fault Act, as is the purpose of compensating any accident .victim even if not in a No-Fault context is just that, i. e., to compensate the victim for the injury suffered. The No-Fault Act was never meant to provide windfalls to accident victims or the survivors of deceased victims. Thus, the Act as drafted presumes a spouse to be dependent on the deceased. Any other relative may still recover under No-Fault if that person is able to establish dependency on the deceased. Further, while the Act itself sets limits on the amount of recovery, see 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.202 (Supp.1980-81), the Act allows recovery in excess of those limits under traditional tort theories of liability. 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.301 (Supp.1980-81); Allstate Insurance Co. v. Heffner, 491 Pa. 447, 421 A.2d 629 (1980) (Survivors of a deceased victim may recover \u201cwork loss\u201d benefits in excess of the Act\u2019s $15,000 limitation on traditional tort theory). I cannot see how my interpretation of the Legislature\u2019s intent violates the declared policy of the Legislature.\nAppellant finally argues that the Statutory Construction Act requires that we adopt her interpretation of \u201csurvivor.\u201d That Act provides:\n\u201c. . . the General Assembly intends the entire statute to be effective and certain.\u201d\n1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1922(2). Or put another way, a statute should be construed in such a manner as to give effect to all its words. Commonwealth v. Driscoll, 485 Pa. 99, 401 A.2d 312 (1979). Appellant argues that a child, parent, brother and sister are all relatives and to require all to prove dependency makes surplusage of those words as used in the Act. Again, as with the last antecedent rule, this principle of statutory construction is not, in and of itself, dispositive. As the entire preceding discussion points out, it is my view that the Legislature intended that all relatives but a spouse must prove dependency on the deceased. One principle of statutory construction, which is only an aid in determining Legislature intent, will not be permitted to change what I perceive as a clear mandate by the Legislature.\nI would affirm the Order of the Superior Court.\nROBERTS and FLAHERTY, JJ., join in this opinion.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL\nNIX, Justice.\nI must disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the phrase \u201cdependent upon the deceased for support\u201d modifies all of the antecedents contained in subsection (B).\nThe majority rejects the \u201clast antecedent rule\u201d and concludes that the clause \u201cdependent upon the decedent for support\u201d modified the words \u201cchild,\u201d \u201cparent,\u201d \u201cbrother,\u201d \u201csister\u201d as well as the word \u201crelative.\u201d Such an interpretation creates a clear redundancy which should have suggested to the majority the error in their interpretation. It is fundamental in statutory construction that the language must be construed in such a manner as to give meaning to all of the words used to convey the thought. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1922(2); Commonwealth v. Driscoll, 485 Pa. 99, 401 A.2d 312 (1979).\nMoreover, the significance of isolating \u201cspouse\u201d in a separate subsection is more probative of the recognition on the part of the legislature of the very unique relationship created by marriage and an intent to distinguish the spousal from other familial relationships.\n.
