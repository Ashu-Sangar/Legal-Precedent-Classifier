DeAngelis and Jack Friedland, relief by the appointment of a receiver and a stay of the pending sheriff sale. This appeal followed.\nThe facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. Pursuant to a judgment entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County at No. 74-10540 against Edwin K. Daly and Jeanne G. Daly, his wife [hereinafter \u201cDalys\u201d] in the amount of $205,147.03, appellants Ferrantes, the judgment creditors, caused a writ of execution to be issued July 23, 1974, under the authority of which the sheriff of Montgomery County, on August 1, 1974, levied upon personal property of the Dalys and at the direction of the Ferrantes took possession of certain ceramic items and antique furnishings found at the Daly residence. Proper notice being given, a judicial sale of the property seized by the sheriff was scheduled for September 25,1974.\nShortly thereafter, the Dalys attempted unsuccessfully to stay the sheriff\u2019s sale by petitioning to open the judgment. However, the Montgomery County Court refused to stay all proceedings in the meanwhile. Thereafter, the Montgomery County Court ordered a stay of the sale, which order was later vacated. Subsequently, counsel representing certain purported creditors of the Dalys, including Sidney M. DeAngelis and Jack Friedland, appellees and plaintiffs below, appeared before Judge Smillie of the Montgomery County Court and successfully deferred the sheriff\u2019s sale until October 23, 1974, upon- the representation that they would interest professional ceramic and antique collectors in the hope of obtaining higher proceeds at the sale. In entering its order, the court below expressly provided that the sale would not be deferred beyond the thirty days.\nPrior to the termination of that stay, DeAngelis, who had entered judgment against Daly in the interim period, commenced these proceedings on October 17, 1974, by filing a complaint in equity (No. 74-15105) seeking to appoint a liquidating receiver over the property and permanently to enjoin the sheriff\u2019s sale of October 23, 1974. Named as defendants in the DeAngelis complaint were appellants, the Dalys and the sheriff of Montgomery County. At approximately 4:00 p. m. on October 17, 1974, the Honorable Vincent A. Cirillo, Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, ruled all named defendants to show cause why the court should not grant the relief requested and scheduled a hearing in that action for Friday, October 18, 1974, the very next day.\nAt the hearing, appellants filed preliminary objections to DeAngelis\u2019 complaint in equity and a memorandum in support thereof. In addition, Jack Friedland filed a nearly identical complaint in equity (No. 74-15173) and served appellants at the hearing.\nOn Monday, October 21, 1974, without entry of a bond by plaintiffs DeAngelis and Friedland, Judge Cirillo entered an order and decree that the scheduled sheriff\u2019s sale be stayed and that a receiver be appointed to take charge of only those assets of the Dalys subject to the levy of the Ferrantes. This order was not accompanied by any findings of fact or conclusions of law supporting its entry. The receiver was also instructed to sell the property subject to the lien of the Ferrantes and distribute the proceeds of the sale to all creditors of the Dalys under a plan later to be approved by the Court.\nOn October 29, 1974, the court below issued, ex parte, an order directing the entry of a receiver\u2019s bond in the amount of $500,000 and directing the receiver to take possession of a card collection levied upon by the Ferrantes but remaining at the Daly premises. On November 4, 1974, the court below issued, ex parte, the following orders: (1) that the receiver take possession of the ceramics and furnishings in the possession of the sheriff subject to the Ferrantes\u2019 levy and arrange for a sale in New York; (2) that counsel for the receiver be appointed; (3) that the receiver temporarily refrain from taking additional property in the possession of the Dalys. On November 8, 1974, upon notice of the orders of the court below, appellants filed this appeal. Appellants also filed exceptions to the order and decree of October 21, 1974, enjoining the sheriff\u2019s sale and appointing the receiver in order to protect their position in the court below.\nOn November 14, 1974, the court below, also ex parte on motion of the receiver, ordered that the receiver transport the levied-upon property in the hands of the sheriff to New York the week of November 18, 1974 for eventual sale. On the same day the property was transported to New York, appellants were first notified of the ex parte petition and order allowing the property to be moved. Thereafter appellants filed a petition for allowance of special supersedeas and writ of prohibition directly to this court.\nThe appellants argue that the court below erred in the appointment of a receiver on petition of non-lien holding j udgment creditors. We agree with appellants.\nWe are of the opinion that the order appointing a receiver in the above matter was in error. In Hogsett v. Thompson, 258 Pa. 85, 101 A. 941 (1917), this court stated:\n\u201cHaving already shown that the aid of a receiver is extended only in behalf of creditors who have fully exhausted their remedy at law, it follows necessarily that the jurisdiction will not be exercised in favor of mere general creditors, whose rights rest only in contract and are not yet reduced to judgment, and who have acquired no lien upon the property of the debtor.\u201d At page 94, 101 A. at page 948. (Emphasis supplied.)\nIn the instant case the appellees who had the receiver appointed did have judgments, but they did not have a lien upon the personal property of the Dalys. Appellees had not yet issued a writ of execution prior to the time they petitioned for an appointment of a receiver. If appellees had sought to attach real estate rather than personal property, they would not have had to seek a writ of execution, since the judgment would have created an automatic lien on the real estate. See 12 P.S. \u00a7 878.\nDecree appointing receiver is vacated and goods are to be returned to the sheriff of Montgomery County. Each party to bear own costs.\nJONES, C. J., took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which NIX and MANDERINO, JJ., joined.\nEAGEN, J., concurs in the result.\n. In Pennsylvania, a lien does not attach to personal property of the judgment debtor until such time as the writ of execution is delivered to the sheriff. See Act of June 16, 1836, P.L. 755, \u00a7 39, 12 P.S. \u00a7 2291.\n. See \u00a7 1533-3 Goodrich-Amram Civil Practice (1970)."}
