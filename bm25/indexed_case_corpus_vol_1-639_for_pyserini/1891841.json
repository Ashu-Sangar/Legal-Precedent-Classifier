{"id": "1891841", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nPlaintiff-appellant appealed from the Judgment of nonsuit. Plaintiff, Louis Klovacs, a police officer of the City of Bethlehem, instituted an action in trespass against defendants, The Bethlehem\u2019s Globe Publishing Company, and John P. McLaughlin, to recover damages for personal injuries arising out of a collision between an automobile owned and driven by McLaughlin and a cruiser car owned by the City of Bethlehem. The jury brought in a verdict of $31,000 against defendant McLaughlin, who was guilty of gross negligence, but a compulsory nonsuit was entered in favor of Publishing Co. by the trial Judge which the Court en banc refused to take off.\nIn Markle v. Robert Hall Clothes, 411 Pa. 282, 191 A. 2d 374, the Court said (page 284) : \u201cIn Flagiello v. Crilly, 409 Pa. 389, 187 A. 2d 289, the Court said (page 390) : \u2018It is hornbook law that a judgment of nonsuit can be entered only in clear cases and plaintiff must be given the benefit of all evidence favorable to him, together with all reasonable inferences of fact arising therefrom, and any conflict in the evidence must be resolved in his favor: Castelli v. Pittsburgh Railways Company, 402 Pa. 135, 165 A. 2d 632; Stimac v. Barkey, 405 Pa. 253, 174 A. 2d 868; Borzik v. Miller, 399 Pa. 293, 159 A. 2d 741.\u2019 \u201d\nMcLaughlin is a reporter who was employed by defendant company. Plaintiff contends that McLaughlin was the servant or agent of the Publishing Co., but he failed to further prove, as the law requires, \u201cthat the driver . . . was engaged in the business of his employer .. . at the time of the accident and that he was acting within the scope of his authority: Warman v. Craig, 321 Pa. 481, 184 A. 757; Orluske v. Nash Pbg. Motors Co., 286 Pa. 170, 133 A. 148; Reed v. Bennett, 276 Pa. 107, 119 A. 827.\u201d Lanteigne v. Smith, 365 Pa. 132, 136, 74 A. 2d 116. Indeed, plaintiff\u2019s evidence proved the exact opposite.\nJudgment of nonsuit affirmed.\nHereinafter referred to as Publishing Co."}
