{"id": "1104403", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn this case, a class bill was filed by four taxpayers, for themselves and others who might see fit to join in the proceedings, asking that an injunction issue restraining the Sesqui-Centennial Exhibition Association, a Pennsylvania corporation, from maintaining and operating its exposition in Philadelphia on Sundays. When the case was argued before this court, on November 23, 1926, the exposition was scheduled to close on December 1, 1926, but there was talk of reopening it for the summer of 1927, an idea which has since been definitely-abandoned. Under the circumstances, it is obvious that all the questions involved are moot.\nIt may be noted, however, that' the latest construction of the Act of April 22, 1794, 3 Sm. L. 177, which, by section 1, regulates the observance of \u201cthe Lord\u2019s Day, commonly known as Sunday,\u201d will be found in Commonwealth v. American Baseball Club, opinion filed simultaneously herewith [the preceding case].\nThe appeal is dismissed."}
