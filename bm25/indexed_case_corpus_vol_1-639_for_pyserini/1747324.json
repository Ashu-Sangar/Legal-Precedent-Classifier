{"id": "1747324", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Justice.\nThese appeals are by the surviving trustees and by some of the trust beneficiaries from the denial of a change of venue and from the appointment of successor trustees by the Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas, Orphans\u2019 Court Division. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 722(3) (1977). We affirm the lower court.\nJoseph Henry Zerbey died in 1933 and by will created three trusts. Each trust was to have the same four trustees. The primary trust was the Newspaper Trust which holds as its principal asset 5960 of the 6000 issued and outstanding voting common shares in J. H. Zerbey Newspapers, Inc., publisher of the Pottsville Republican newspaper. This trust will continue until the testator\u2019s last surviving child dies at which time the corpus will be distributed to testator\u2019s then living grandchildren, if any, or to testator\u2019s heirs. Testator was survived by four children of which two daughters, Elizabeth Zerbey Martz (appellee) and Mildred Zerbey Lazarus (appellant) are still living.\nThe twelfth clause of testator\u2019s will established the mechanism for the appointment of successor trustees:\n\u201cTWELFTH: I order and direct that the President Judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Schuylkill County shall appoint any vacancies which may exist by death, resignation or otherwise, in the number of my trustees or executors, it being my intent that there should at all times be the same number of trustees and executors. The said appointment shall be made upon the petition of the surviving trustees or executors or any of them.\u201d\nTwo trustees died in the fall of 1975. The two surviving trustees petitioned the lower court for the appointment of successor trustees pursuant to the twelfth clause of the will. The surviving trustees nominated Nadine F. Oswald and Margaretta Paduch to succeed the deceased trustees. These nominees were opposed by one of testator\u2019s daughters \u2014 Elizabeth Zerbey Martz \u2014 an income beneficiary of the trust, who asked the court to exercise its discretion to appoint completely independent trustees.\nThe lower court held hearings on the conflicting positions and on March 8, 1976, the court appointed as successor trustees two individuals who had not been nominated and who had no connection either with the Zerbey family or with the newspaper corporation: Thomas A. Elliott, Jr. and Willis R. Parnell. The court\u2019s order was signed by Orphans\u2019 Division Judge Bowe and by Common Pleas President Judge Curran. The surviving trustees and certain of the beneficiaries filed exceptions and petitions requesting change of venue. The lower court dismissed the preliminary objections on November 8, 1976 and granted all parties full and complete hearings, in November and December, 1976, on their exceptions and petitions for change of venue. By order of April 18, 1977, Judge Bowe and President Judge Curran dismissed the petitions for change of venue as well as appellants\u2019 exceptions, and confirmed the appointments of Messrs. Parnell and Elliott as trustees. Appellants then filed these appeals.\nThis is not the first time we have been called upon to review the twelfth clause of this will, see Zerbey Estate, 356 Pa. 2, 50 A.2d 681 (1947) (Zerbey I). However, the unification of the Pennsylvania judicial system in 1969 has caused an ambiguity in the will that was not earlier present. While the twelfth clause gives the power to appoint successor trustees to \u201cthe President Judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Schuylkill County,\u201d as of January 1, 1969, the Orphans\u2019 Court was abolished and became the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas. See Pa.Const.Schedule to art. 5, \u00a7 4 (1969). Additionally, the president judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court became the president judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas for the remainder of his term. Id., \u00a7 5.\nIt is clear that testator intended that the judge presiding over orphans\u2019 court matters in Schuylkill County to be the person who would appoint successor trustees. The title given this person is unimportant as long as he exercises the powers of the president judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court. Thus, the presiding judge or the judge chosen to sit in the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Schuylkill County Court of Common Pleas i. e. Judge Bowe, is the successor to the power to appoint trustees granted in the past to the president judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court by the twelfth clause of testator\u2019s will. Our analysis of testator\u2019s intent also leads us to conclude that the participation of Common Pleas Court President Judge Curran in these proceedings was superfluous.\nAppellants allege that Judge Bowe\u2019s rejection of their suggested nominees was an abuse of discretion and that there existed sufficient grounds upon which their petition for a change of venue should have been granted. The general rule is that substituted trustees should be selected from among the nominations made by the parties in interest, if the nominees are qualified. Anderton v. Patterson, 363 Pa. 121, 69 A.2d 87 (1949); McCaskey\u2019s Estate, 293 Pa. 497, 143 A. 209 (1928). However, this rule does not apply when the trust agreement contains contrary provisions, such as those in clause twelve of the will before us. Zerbey I, supra; Stolzenbach\u2019s Estate, 346 Pa. 74, 29 A.2d 6 (1943). In these cases, the exercise of the court\u2019s sound discretion is the criterion for the exercise of its appointive power. See Taylor\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 1, 181 A. 482 (1935); McCaskey\u2019s Estate, supra. This is especially true where, as here, the trust agreement has expressly committed the appointive power to the Orphans\u2019 Court.\nAppellants contend that past decisions of this Court and a settlement agreement approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court on March 18,1968, compelled Judge Bowe to appoint as successor trustees members of the Zerbey family or employees of the newspaper. Thus they contend that Judge Bowe\u2019s refusal to appoint one of the grandchildren of testator and an employee of The Republican was error. The basic premise upon which appellants have built this argument is without support.\nFirst, the twelfth clause does not contain even a hint that such was the intent of the testator. Second, in Zerbey I, supra, it was stated that the testator did not require the court to \u201cappoint the persons nominated by the trustees; the final decision as to who is to be appointed lies with the President Judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d Zerbey I, supra, 356 Pa. at 7, 50 A.2d at 683. Nor does the 1968 settlement agreement aid appellants\u2019 argument. Paragraph 5(a) of that agreement states that \u201cthe parties acknowledge the final responsibility of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Schuylkill County, in the event of a vacancy in the position of trustee, to appoint a successor trustee.\u201d Since the testator failed to place limits upon the class of persons who could be appointed trustee, Judge Bowe did not err in appointing two independent trustees.\nThe nominees of the surviving trustees and of the appellants to fill the first vacancy were Margaretta Lazarus Paduch or, in the alternative, Johanne Zerbey Martz or Uzal H. Martz, Jr. All three are grandchildren of the testator and beneficiaries of the trust. Although cestuis que trustent are not barred from being trustees for themselves and others, they are not altogether fit persons for the office of trustee due to the possible conflict between their interest as beneficiaries and their duty as trustees. Fox Estate, 264 Pa. 478, 107 A. 863 (1919). Additionally, Uzal H. Martz, Jr. is a director and president of the newspaper corporation, Johanne Zerbey Martz is assistant counsel for the corporation, and Margaretta Lazarus Paduch is a director and resides in New Jersey. It was not unreasonable for Judge Bowe to conclude that these nominees could not give the actions of the board of directors the objective scrutiny required as a trustee. Judge Bowe did not abuse his discretion by failing to appoint one of these three nominees.\nThe nominee for the second vacancy was Nadine F. Oswald who, at the time of her nomination, was a full time assistant to Uzal H. Martz, Jr., president of the newspaper corporation. Here again, the court below had a sufficient basis to conclude that Ms. Oswald could not be sufficiently disinterested to properly serve as trustee.\nAppellants further contend that the appointments of Thomas A. Elliott, Jr. and Willis R. Parnell as successor trustees were tainted by illicit motives and purposes. Appellants\u2019 only allegation of impropriety in Judge Bowe\u2019s appointment of Mr. Parnell is as follows:\n\u201cWillis R. Parnell, at age 72, is a close personal friend and business associate of Judge Guy A. Bowe, Jr., and, in his former capacity as Trust Officer of the Tamaqua National Bank, and later an officer and member of the advisory board of the American Bank and Trust Company with which it merged, had both direct and indirect supervisory authority over the Trust holding the Tamaqua Courier newspaper as an asset during the time culminating with its demise as a newspaper.\u201d\nTestimony given at the November 26, 1976 hearing shows that appellant\u2019s contentions are without merit. The testimony shows that Judge Bowe and Mr. Parnell serve on two bank advisory boards together, that Judge Bowe was a director at the Tamaqua National Bank while Mr. Parnell was in the employ of that bank prior to 1964, that Judge Bowe as an attorney at that time was one of the many attorneys engaged from time to time regarding trust estates administered by the Tamaqua Bank, that Judge Bowe and Mr. Parnell live in Hometown, Pa., and reside a few hundred feet from each other, and that though they are friends and have played golf together, they are not otherwise involved socially and do not move in the same social circles. These facts do not add up to a showing of favoritism or improper conduct on the part of Judge Bowe. The nature of the relationship between Judge Bowe and Mr. Parnell does not detract from the fact that Mr. Parnell is well qualified to handle trust duties.\nEqually without merit is the contention that Mr. Parnell\u2019s actions caused the demise of the Tamaqua Courier. The record indicates that the Courier was sold long after Mr. Parnell had terminated his connection with the trust governing that newspaper. The record further shows that the Courier operated very profitably under Mr. Parnell\u2019s direction. For these reasons we find that Judge Bowe did not abuse the sound discretion of the court in making this appointment.\nWith regard to the appointment of Mr. Elliott, all of appellants\u2019 allegations of misconduct and bias attach to President Judge Curran, and none involve Judge Bowe. Because we have concluded that President Judge Curran\u2019s participation in this matter was superfluous, and because the record indicates that Judge Bowe exercised his independent judgment in appointing Mr. Elliott as trustee, we find that Judge Bowe did not abuse the sound discretion of the court in appointing Mr. Elliott.\nWe further hold that Judge Bowe did not exhibit bias or interest sufficient to warrant a change of venue or transference of this case to another judge. We therefore affirm Judge Bowe\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 petition for a change of venue. We find equally meritless appellants\u2019 exceptions to Judge Bowe\u2019s disposition of their various other petitions and motions.\nThe appointive power of the twelfth clause of the will was exercisable solely by Judge Bowe. However, lacking an interpretation by this Court of that clause in light of the abolition of the separate Orphans\u2019 Court structure and out of an abundance of caution, Judge Bowe and Schuylkill County Common Pleas Court President Judge Curran jointly heard four days of testimony on the petition for a change of venue and jointly signed the orders appointing Messrs. Parnell and Elliott as trustees, dismissing appellants\u2019 exceptions to those appointments, and dismissing the petition for a change of venue. Even though President Judge Curran sat in these proceedings with Judge Bowe, the record indicates that Judge Bowe\u2019s disposition of these matters was arrived at independently of President Judge Curran.\nBecause President Judge Curran participated fully in the proceedings below, fairness and the appearance of fairness dictate that we review appellants\u2019 allegations of bias and interest on the part of President Judge Curran. The gravaman of appellants\u2019 argument is that Mr. Elliott is controlled by President Judge Curran and that President Judge Curran has interests that directly conflict with those of the newspaper trust. Appellants accordingly contend that a change of venue should have been granted pursuant to Act of March 30, 1875, P.L. 35, 12 P.S. \u00a7 111 (Third) or \u00a7 113(111) (1953).\n\u2018 Appellants\u2019 claim that Mr. Elliott was not a proper choice for trustee is based on the following facts. Mr. Elliott is the chief operating officer and a director of the Minersville Bank and Trust Co., of which President Judge Curran is vice president and chairman of the Board; President Judge Curran\u2019s son is vice president, a director and solicitor for the same bank; and President Judge Curran\u2019s nephew is the president and a director. Mr. Elliott, as part of his duties at the bank, approved a loan to President Judge Curran\u2019s son and nephew for the purchase of a local radio station that competes with the Pottsville Republican for news and advertising. This leads appellants to conclude that Mr. Elliott will be forced by his employers \u2014 President Judge Curran, his son, and nephew \u2014 to use his position as trustee to undermine the Republican to the advantage of the competing radio station owned by President Judge Curran\u2019s son and nephew. Appellants reach this conclusion by first assuming such obviously improper entreaties will be made by President Judge Curran, his son, or his nephew. Second, appellants assume that Mr. Elliott will be responsive to these entreaties.\nIn responding to these claims, a number of points must be made. First, the record is wholly devoid of any indication that the improper interference appellants fear will occur or that Mr. Elliott could reasonably be expected to be responsive to such pressure. Second, Mr. Elliott\u2019s impressive background in trust affairs weighs heavily against any presumption of future impropriety. Mr. Elliott was employed as a bank examiner in the United States Comptroller\u2019s Office in 1937. He has functioned as a commercial examiner, a trust examiner, a foreign department examiner and then from 1959 until 1970, he was employed by the United States Treasury Department, Comptroller of Currency, as a representative in trusts with the duty of examining National Banks exercising trust power in the Third National Bank Region. While he was employed with the United States Treasury Department, Mr. Elliott \u201cexamined the trust departments of practically every National Bank in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that were exercising trust powers, including our local banks, surrounding area banks and the major banks in the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d Mr. Elliott received the Albert Gallatin Award for outstanding service while employed by the Comptroller of the Currency. In 1970, he was employed by the Minersville Safe Deposit Bank where he functions as a cashier, trust officer and a director. Mr. Elliott is a member of the executive committee of Group Two of the Pennsylvania Bankers\u2019 Association, and is a first vice president of the Schuylkill County Bankers Association. On occasion he has been a lecturer at the Pennsylvania Trust School conducted at Bucknell University.\nThird, it must be remembered that the participation of President Judge Curran in these proceedings was entirely superfluous.\nFourth, appellants\u2019 allegations do not connect Mr. Elliott with President Judge Curran other than as an employee of a bank of which President Judge Curran is chairman of the board. The record indicates that neither Mr. Elliott nor President Judge Curran have financial interests of any sort in the corporation owning the competing radio station. The record further indicates that Mr. Elliott does not have any business connections with President Judge Curran, his son, or his nephew, other than through the Minersville Bank as part of his normal duties. In sum, the record indicates every reason to believe that Mr. Elliott will act with the utmost good faith and highest fidelity in administering the trust and in the performance of his fiduciary duties.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division. Each party to bear own costs.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nMANDERINO, J., concurred in the result.\n. President Judge Curran\u2019s term expired January 2, 1978.\n. This act provides in relevant part:\nChange of Venue For Interest or Prejudice\n\u201cChanges of venue shall be made in any civil cause, in law or in equity, depending in any of the courts of this Commonwealth, in the cases following; namely,\u2014\nFirst. Whenever the judge, who by law is required to try or hear the same, shall be personally interested in the event of such cause, or in the question to be determined thereby.\n******\nThird. Whenever any near relative of such judge shall be a party to any such cause, or interested in the event thereof, unless the judge so interested shall select another judge, learned in the law, not so related, to hear and determine the same.\u201d ******\nAct of March 30, 1875, P.L. 35, 12 P.S. \u00a7 111 (1953). This act was not suspended by recent changes in Pennsylvania procedure, see Pa.R.C.P. No. 1006(d), 42 Pa.C.S.\n. This act provides in relevant part:\nFurther Grounds For Change of Venue\n\u201cChanges of venue may be made in any civil cause in law or equity depending in any of the courts of this commonwealth in cases following, to wit:\n******\nIII. Whenever it shall be made to appear to the court that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had in the county in which any such case is depending.\u201d\n******\nAct of March 30, 1875, P.L. 35, 12 P.S. \u00a7 113 (1953). This act was not suspended by recent changes in Pennsylvania Procedure, see Pa.R.C.P. No. 1006(d), 42 Pa.C.S.\n. See Holmes\u2019 Trust, 392 Pa. 17, 139 A.2d 548 (1955); see also In re Killey\u2019s Estate, 457 Pa. 474, 326 A.2d 372 (1974). Of course, should a direct and continuing conflict actually develop between the trustee\u2019s personal interests and those of the trust, or should the trustee mismanage the estate to the disadvantage of the beneficiaries, proper grounds for the trustee\u2019s removal have been stated. See 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3182(1), 7121; Holmes\u2019 Trust, supra ; McCaskey\u2019s Estate, 293 Pa. 497, 143 A. 209 (1928)."}
