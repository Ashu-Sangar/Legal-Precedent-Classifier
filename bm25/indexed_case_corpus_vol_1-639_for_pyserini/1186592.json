{"id": "1186592", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe five Judges who heard this appeal all agree that it must be dismissed. We have held in a number of cases that: \u201cWhile the granting or refusal of a preliminary injunction is the subject of appeal, yet in such case we refrain from a discussion of the merits of the litigation and merely determine whether, under the facts presented in the court below, there was a reasonable ground for its action\u201d: Holden v. Llewellyn et al., 262 Pa. 400, at pp. 402 and 403.\nThe questions involved come from the Election Code of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, and we find that the court below had \u201creasonable ground for its action.\u201d\nAppeal dismissed.\nSee also: Gemmell et al. v. Fox et al., 241 Pa. 146, 151; Sunbury Boro. v. Sunbury & S.
