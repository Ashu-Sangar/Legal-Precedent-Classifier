{"id": "854177", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe see no reason for disturbing the discretionary action of the learned court below in this case in setting aside the sheriff\u2019s sale. The reasons stated in the opinion are quite sufficient to justify the action \u00f3f the court. The application to set the sale aside was made immediately after the sale and' before the acknowledgment of any deed. The price was grossly inadequate, and the court was at liberty to seize upon any other circumstances in order to give relief. We do not review the action of the lower courts in setting aside sheriff\u2019s sales except in extreme cases, and this is not one of them.\nOrder affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant."}
