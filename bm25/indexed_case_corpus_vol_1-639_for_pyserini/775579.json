{"id": "775579", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPAPADAKOS, Justice.\nThis appeal as of right arises from a declaratory judgment action filed by Appellant, American Casualty Company of Reading, PA (American Casualty) against PHICO Insurance Company (PHICO) and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss Fund (the CAT Fund); Sharon DiRienzo, and David and Suzanne Richard, as parents and natural guardians of Christopher Richard, and in their own right, were joined as potentially interested parties. The action was filed initially in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, invoking that court\u2019s original jurisdiction. It was decided by the court on four motions: PHICO\u2019s motion for summary judgment, American Casualty\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment, the CAT Fund\u2019s application for summary relief, and American Casualty\u2019s cross-application for summary relief.\nThe Commonwealth Court on January 24, 1992, entered a summary judgment in favor of PHICO and denied American Casualty\u2019s motion for summary judgment. They also granted the CAT Fund\u2019s application for summary relief, in part, and denied American Casualty\u2019s cross-application for summary relief.\nThe facts of this case are not in dispute. David and Suzanne Richard filed a suit for damages against Sharon DiRienzo and several other defendants in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas (the Richard action). That suit has been settled for an amount in excess of two million dollars. The Richards, in their own right and acting as parents and natural guardians of Christopher Richard, alleged that DiRienzo was negligent in providing nursing care and treatment at the time Suzanne Richard was about to give birth to Christopher on January 29 and 30, 1988. At that time, DiRienzo was acting in the course and scope of her employment by Bryn Mawr Hospital as a delivery room nurse. The Richards claimed that, as a result of DiRienzo\u2019s conduct, severe and permanent brain damage was sustained by Christopher, and that pain and suffering and expenses were inflicted upon David and Suzanne Richard. The complaint further alleged that Bryn Mawr Hospital was liable to the Richards as the employer of DiRienzo and also because of its own negligence.\nAt the time of the alleged negligence, DiRienzo was covered by three policies of insurance which were applicable to the claims set forth in the Richard action. American Casualty had issued to DiRienzo a Professional Nurse\u2019s Liability Policy, No. NS03807436 (American Casualty policy). That policy was subject to a limit of $1,000,000.00. The policy covered both DiRienzo\u2019s professional and non-business activities. American Casualty contends that its policy specifically stated in its \u201cother insurance\u201d clause that, in effect, it provided excess insurance only. DiRienzo p\u00e1id an annual premium of $58.00 for the policy.\nPHICO issued two policies of insurance to Bryn Mawr Hospital which afforded coverage to DiRienzo by virtue of her status as an employee there. A Health Care Provider\u2019s Comprehensive Liability Policy (No. HP2001), provided Institutional Professional Liability Coverage (Coverage C) for the hospital\u2019s professional employees, other than physicians, for liability arising out of rendering or failure to render professional services (the PHICO Primary Policy). The \u201cother insurance\u201d clause in the PHICO Primary Policy stated that its coverage was primary. The limit of that policy was $200,-000.00, which covered DiRienzo as a professional employee of the hospital.\nCoverages A, B, D and E in Phico\u2019s Primary Policy do not apply to DiRienzo in this case and are not at issue. The premium for the PHICO Primary Policy was $121,563.00 for the period of two months and ten days for which PHICO has provided such information (November 20,1987 through February 1, 1988). During the same period, the portion of the premium attributable to Coverage C, \u201cInstitutional Professional Liability,\u201d was $63,643.00..\nPHICO also issued to Bryn Mawr Hospital a second policy (No. EP2001) (the PHICO Excess Policy) which provided for DiRienzo, as a professional employee of Bryn Mawr Hospital, excess \u201cProfessional Liability\u201d coverage with a $10,000,000.00 limit. The PHICO Excess Policy consisted of two parts: Coverage A, titled \u201cProfessional Liability,\u201d which was the only coverage applicable to DiRienzo in this case, and Coverage B, titled \u201cUmbrella Liability.\u201d Umbrella Liability coverage, however, is not at issue in this matter because that coverage expressly excluded insurance for liability arising from professional services. The premium for the Phico excess policy, for the period of two months and ten days (November 20, 1987 through February 1, 1988) was $120,188.00, of which amount $105,119.00 applied to Coverage A, \u201cProfessional Liability,\u201d while $15,069.00 applied to Coverage B, \u201cUmbrella Liability.\u201d\nThe Health Care Services Malpractice Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1301.101, et seq. (the Act) covers up to $1,000,000.00 any \u201chealth care provider\u201d as defined in the Act with respect to his or her professional liability.\nIn its petition for this declaratory judgment action, American Casualty asserted, at Count I, that its policy provided only excess insurance for DiRienzo; that PHICO\u2019s Primary Policy provided for her primary coverage; and that PHICO\u2019s Excess Policy applied concurrently\u2014on a pro rata basis\u2014with coverage of American Casualty and in excess of the amounts collectible by DiRienzo under the PHICO Primary Policy and from the CAT Fund.\nAt Count II, American Casualty asserted that DiRienzo was a \u201chealth care provider\u201d; that therefore the CAT Fund must provide for her coverage as required by the Act up to $1,000,-000.00; that the American Casualty Policy was excess insurance -within the meaning of Section 705(a) of the Act; and that only in the event the coverage owed DiRienzo by PHICO under its primary policy and by the CAT Fund were inadequate, American Casualty and PHICO, under their excess policies, would be required to indemnify her as excess co-insurers on a pro-rata basis.\nOn April 19, 1991, PHICO moved for summary judgment contending that American Casualty\u2019s policy provided primary coverage for DiRienzo, that PHICO\u2019s Primary Policy was excess or co-primary insurance with American Casualty\u2019s policy and that PHICO\u2019s excess policy was excess over the other two policies.\nAmerican Casualty filed a cross-motion for summary judgment asserting that its coverage was in excess of coverage under PHICO\u2019s primary policy and that the responsibility for the sums covered under both PHICO\u2019s excess policy and the American Casualty policy should be prorated in accordance with the limits of those policies.\nThe CAT Fund filed an application for summary relief seeking a declaration that DiRienzo was not a \u201chealth care provider\u201d and that the American Casualty policy was not excess insurance within the meaning of the Act. American Casualty filed a cross-application for summary relief seeking a declaration that DiRienzo qualified as a \u201chealth care provider\u201d and that its policy was excess insurance under the Act and that therefore the CAT Fund\u2019s $1,000,000.00 coverage must be exhausted before the American Casualty policy is triggered.\nThe Commonwealth Court granted PHICO\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied American Casualty\u2019s cross-motion, ruling that the policy of American Casualty would be triggered as a residual primary policy upon exhaustion of the $200,000.00 limit of the PHICO primary policy; that the PHICO Excess Policy would apply as excess insurance over that provided by the PHICO Primary Policy and the American Casualty policy, and over coverage provided by the CAT Fund; that DiRienzo was not a \u201chealth care provider\u201d within the meaning of the Act; that the American Casualty policy was not excess insurance within the meaning of Section 705(a) of the Act; and that, although not a \u201chealth care provider,\u201d DiRienzo is entitled to $1,000,000.00 coverage by the CAT Fund because she was an employee of a hospital. This appeal followed.\nThe Commonwealth Court, in their opinion, first considers American Casualty\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause and compares it to the \u201cpro rata\u201d other insurance clause in PHICO\u2019s excess policy. American Casualty\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause provides as follows:\nIf you have other insurance which applies to the loss, the other insurance must pay first. It is the intent of this policy to apply to the amount of loss which is more than the limit of liability of the other insurance. We will not pay more than our limit of liability.\n(See, 145 Pa.Cmwlth. 184, 602 A.2d 904, at 907).\nThe Commonwealth Court agreed with PHICO\u2019s argument that this clause did not convert American Casualty\u2019s liability coverage from primary to excess and they relied on a superficial analogy to the case of Aetna Casualty, Ins. Co. v. United Services Automobile Assn., 676 F.Supp. 79 (E.D.Pa.1987), in drawing that conclusion. Next, the Commonwealth Court determined that the American Casualty policy and the PHICO prim,ary policy were concurrent primary policies and that, hence, the \u201cother insurance\u201d clauses in both policies were triggered. As a result of this triggering, the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause contained in the PHICO primary policy had to be interpreted, and it was concluded to be a \u201cpro rata\u201d clause which meant that the PHICO primary policy had to be treated as providing primary coverage to Nurse DiRienzo. Because the American Casualty policy contained \u201can unqualified excess clause\u201d (145 Pa.Cmwlth. 184, at 195, 602 A.2d 904, at 909), the Commonwealth Court thought that it had to be interpreted as providing residual primary coverage. Hence, that Court ruled that PHICO\u2019s primary policy paid the first $200,000.00 of indemnity expense and that when that limit was exhausted, that American Casualty\u2019s primary policy as residual primary insurance had to kick in for the next $1,000,000.00.\nNurse DiRienzo was found not to be a health care provider under 40 P.S. \u00a7 1301.701(a) and hence ineligible to participate in the Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss (CAT) Fund as such. She was, however, found to be entitled to coverage by the CAT Fund by virtue of being a hospital employee. Hence the CAT Fund was held to be responsible for providing coverage up to $1,000,000.00 for DiRienzo\u2019s negligence (if any) as a hospital employee, but only after the exhaustion of the two policies found to be primary. Because DiRienzo was found not to be a health care provider, however, she was found not to be entitled to a separate, additional $1,000,000.00 of CAT Fund coverage in her individual capacity. Finally, the Commonwealth Court determined that American Casualty\u2019s policy was not excess insurance coverage vis-a-vis the CAT Fund under 40 P.S. \u00a7 1301.705.\nThe net result of the Commonwealth Court decision was to rule that PHICO\u2019s primary policy must pay the first $200,-000.00 herein; that American Casualty, as residual primary insurer, pays the next $1,000,000.00; the CAT Fund is obligated to pay the next $1,000,000.00; and if the judgment in the underlying action exceeds these limits, PHICO\u2019s excess policy of $10,000,000.00 kicks in.\nWhat stands out most glaringly in the Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion is the fact that the American Casualty policy is treated as both a primary policy and as a residual or excess policy at one and the same time. In our judgment, it cannot be both. Moreover, under the crystal clear language of the American Casualty\u2019s policy\u2019s \u201cother insurance\u201d clause, quoted above, it is hard to see how that policy can be construed as anything but an excess policy. In Vrabel v. Scholler, 369 Pa. 235, 85 A.2d 858 (1952), we stated:\nIn the absence of contrary or modifying provisions in a statute, the liability of an insurer and the extent of the loss under a policy of automobile liability insurance must be determined, measured and limited by the terms of the contract. This means that under a policy containing a standard \u201cother insurance\u201d or \u201cpro rata\u201d clause, only the pro rata part of the insured loss which was sustained may be recovered by the insured from each insurer in accordance with the terms of the policy. Id., 242-243, 85 A.2d at 861-62.\nThe \u201cterms of the contract\u201d here are, as conceded, in \u201cplain English.\u201d They could not be clearer. \u201cIf you have other insurance which applies to the loss, the other insurance must pay first.\u201d This is an excess insurance clause both in itself and under 40 P.S. \u00a7 1301.705. The Commonwealth Court conclusion on this point must be reversed.\nThe order of payment of the insurance proceeds in this case must also be resolved, in part, by reference to 40 P.S. \u00a7 1301.705(a) which provides:\n(a) No insurer providing excess professional liability insurance to any health care provider eligible for coverage under the Medical Profession Liability Catastrophe Loss Fund shall be hable for payment of any claim against a health care provider for any loss or damages except those in excess of the limits of liability provided by the Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss Fund.\nHence, in the instant case, the first $200,000.00 of liability must be borne by PHICO\u2019s primary policy, and next the CAT Fund must kick in for its share. Only then do the excess policies of American Casualty and PHICO bear liability and that liability should be pro-rated in accordance with the pro-ration clause in PHICO\u2019s excess policy.\nWe find that the Commonwealth Court was correct in concluding that the CAT Fund was not liable instantly based upon its conclusion that Nurse DiRienzo is not a \u201chealth care provider\u201d in her own right under the Health Care Service Malpractice Act. The definition of \u201chealth care provider\u201d under the statute, at 40 P.S. \u00a7 1301.103 provides:\n\u201cHealth care provider\u201d means a primary health center or a person, corporation, facility, institution or other entity licensed or approved by the Commonwealth to provide health care or professional medical services as a physician, an osteopathic physician, or surgeon, a certified nurse midwife, a podiatrist, hospital, nursing home, birth center, and except as to section 701(a), an officer, employee or agent of any of them acting in the course and scope of his employment. (Emphasis added)\nSection 701(a) reads as follows:\n(a) Every health care provider as defined in this act, practicing medicine or podiatry or otherwise providing health care services in the Commonwealth shall insure his professional liability only with an insurer licensed or approved by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, or provide proof of self-insurance in accordance with this section.\n(l)(i) A health care provider, other than hospitals, who conducts more than 50% of his health care business or practice within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shall insure or self-insure his professional liability in the amount of $100,000 per occurrence and $300,000 per annual aggregate, and hospitals located in the Commonwealth shall insure or self-insure their professional liability in the amount of $100,000 per occurrence, and $1,000,000 per annual aggregate, hereinafter known as \u201cbasic coverage insurance\u201d and they shall be entitled to participate in the fund____ (emphasis added).\nStripped of its verbiage, the statute reads:\nA health care provider:\n1) shall insure; and\n2) shall be entitled to participate in the fund.\nThis section imposes an insurance requirement and compels the fund to cover a health care provider. Section 1301.103 specifically excepts nurses, as hospital employees, from the definition of \u201chealth care provider\u201d as used in \u00a7 1301.701(a). Not only are nurses excepted from the basic coverage insurance, but they are also not entitled to participate in the fund.\nFor the reasons set forth above, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the matter remanded to that Court for such further proceedings as may be necessary.\nLARSEN, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nMONTEMURO, J., files a Joining and Concurring Opinion in which NIX, C.J., and FLAHERTY and CAPPY, JJ., join.\nMONTEMURO, J., who was an appointed Justice of the Court at the time of argument, participated in the decision of this case in his capacity as a Senior Justice.\n. The briefs in this appeal do not make it clear whether excess liability under the PHICO excess policy and the American Casualty policy should be pro-rated or not. If any of the parties wish to contest this issue, that is best done initially at the Commonwealth Court level, and the parties herein are free to do so upon remand.\n. This analysis is borrowed from Mr. Justice Montemuro\u2019s learned Concurring Opinion in which he analyzes in depth the reasons why Nurse DiRienzo is not a health care provider in her own right and entitled to separate coverage."}
