{"id": "1329419", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 4th day of May, 2004, appeal is GRANTED, LIMITED to Petitioner\u2019s third question (\u201cWas the Superior Court in error when it determined that Petitioner waived the last three issues argued on appeal because these very, same arguments were raised before the trial court in the Concise Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal?\u201d). Since the trial court accepted Petitioner\u2019s supplemental statement pursuant to Pa.R.A.P.1925 and addressed Petitioner\u2019s fourth issue in its Rule 1925 opinion (\u201cDid the trial court commit an error of law in determining that Appellant was a sexually violent predator when the Commonwealth did not present clear and convincing evidence to establish the classification of sexually violent predator?\u201d), the Superior Court\u2019s order is VACATED in relevant regard, and the matter is remanded for appellate consideration of such issue.\nJurisdiction is relinquished."}
