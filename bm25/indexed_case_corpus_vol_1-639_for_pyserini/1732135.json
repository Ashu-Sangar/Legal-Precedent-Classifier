The following issues were raised, considered and found to be without merit: a) a claim of after discovered evidence; b) alleged violation of hearsay rule; c) alleged improper reference to appellant\u2019s prior criminal activity; d) alleged improper comments by the district attorney; and e) an asserted claim of an unnecessary delay between arrest and arraignment.
