{"id": "1063589", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Walling,\nThis is an action of foreign attachment in assumpsit, and the single question raised is as to the proper construction of a written contract. The plaintiff, American Dressier Tunnel Kilns, Inc., is a corporation of the state of New York, engaged in the erection, under patents, of tunnel-shaped kilns, for use in the manufacture of pottery, brick, steel, etc. The defendant, George H. Holt, is in business at Chicago, under the name of George H. Holt & Company. Plaintiff lacked means for the proper prosecution of its own business and the granting of help to those who might desire to become its patrons ; so, after extended negotiations, the parties hereto entered into a written contract, in November, 1916 (called the main contract), whereby defendant (called the grantee) was to finance the construction of the kilns for those who might wish to have them installed; and later the purchaser (called the applicant) was to repay him the agreed price for the kilns, called in the contract the \u201ccash price.\u201d Plaintiff (called the grantor) was to do all the work and furnish all the materials for the construction of the kilns, for which it was to receive from defendant what the agreement defines as the \u201ccontract price\u201d \u2014 being eighty-eight per cent of the \u201ccash price.\u201d Pursuant to the main contract the parties hereto contracted with applicants for the erection of various kilns amounting in all to about $300,000. This case hinges upon section 5 Of article 4 of the main contract, which is as follows, viz: \u201cThe contract price payable by Grantee to Grantor, as in the two preceding sections determined and fixed, shall be payable by Grantee to Grantor as follows: One Thousand ($1,000.00) Dollars upon signing of contract as an advance payment; a sum equal to 25% of the cash price, less the One Thousand ($1,000.00) Dollars already advanced, to be received by Grantor shall be payable to Grantor when Grantor has blue prints ready, foundations laid, and walls started; a sum equal to 25% of said cash price to Grantor when heating, cooling and combustion chambers and pipes are in place; a sum equal to 25% of said cash price to Grantor when the Kiln is ready to fire and the other equipment is ready for operation; the remainder of the contract price due Grantor shall be paid by Grantee thirty days after the firing of the completed Min and upon the acceptance of said Kiln and equipment and settlement therefor with Grantee, by Applicant maMng first payment and delivery to and acceptance of notes by Grantee or upon Applicant\u2019s cash settlement with Grantee according as Applicant purchases upon deferred payments or for cash.\u201d\nPlaintiff contends that the first, second and third payments specified in the section above quoted should each be 25% of the cost to applicant, while defendant contends that each should be only 25% of plaintiff\u2019s compensation or 22% of the total cost. The trial judge sustained plaintiff\u2019s contention and, from judgment entered upon the verdict in its favor defendant brought this appeal.\nIn our opinion the trial court was right. The contract must be construed as a whole, and section 3 of article 4 states, inter alia, that, \u201cGrantor shall receive from Grantee, in full payment therefor, a price, hereinafter referred to as contract price, equal to the cash price named in the contract between Grantee and Applicant less a sum equal to 12% thereof\u201d; and in sections 2 and 4 of the same article the price grantee (Holt) was to receive from the applicant is referred to as the \u201ccash price.\u201d Hence, when section 5 repeatedly refers to \u201ccash price\u201d and also to \u201ccontract price,\u201d the former must be construed as meaning the price paid to Holt, and the latter as the price received by the Dressier Company. There is no other reason for the separate use of the terms \u201ccash price\u201d and \u201ccontract price\u201d in that section. We must assume that those terms as there used mean what the contract says they mean. This conclusion is strengthened by the fact that the first, second and third payments are respectively designated as 25% of the cash price, and the last payment as \u201cthe remainder of the contract price.\u201d If the terms were intended to mean the same price, why not say \u201cthe remainder of the cash price\u201d or \u201cthe remaining 25%.\u201d As in the contract the words \u201ccash price\u201d and \u201ccontract price\u201d refer to different things, we must assume that each was intended to express its proper meaning in section 5. In other words, since the price grantor (Dressier) was to receive is expressly defined as the \u201ccontract price,\u201d and the price grantee (Holt) was to receive was the \u201ccash price,\u201d we cannot assume that the latter term was three times mistakenly used for the former in this section, especially as the term \u201ccontract price\u201d is therein twice correctly used. The draftsman evidently had in mind the two distinct prices, for it is significant that in referring to the 25% payments, the term \u201ccash price\u201d is uniformly employed and not \u201ccontract price,\u201d or \u201cprice\u201d as would naturally have been done had such payments been based on the amount Dressier was to receive. The words, \u201cto be received by grantor,\u201d are seemingly redundant and might refer to the 25% of the cash price or to the $1,000; but cannot change the term \u201ccash price\u201d to \u201ccontract price.\u201d The phrase \u201cto grantor\u201d in the clause, \u201ca sum equal to 25% of said cash price to grantor,\u201d would seem to express the same thought as \u201cshall be payable to grantor.\u201d Considering the entire contract, its meaning is not doubtful, and, therefore, we cannot consider the evidence, pro and con, as to the parties\u2019 own construction thereof. It is only in case of doubt or ambiguity that the parties\u2019 own construction can be resorted to: Atchison v. United P. Board of Pub., 266 Pa. 47; Lenox C. Co. v. Duncan-Spangler C. Co., 265 Pa. 572, 575, and cases there cited.\nThe assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed."}
