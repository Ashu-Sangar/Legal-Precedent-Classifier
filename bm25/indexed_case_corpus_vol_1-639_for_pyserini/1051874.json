{"id": "1051874", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal is from a preliminary injunction. As there was apparently sufficient ground for the action of the court below, we will not, under our established practice, consider the merits of the case at this stage of it, and the status quo will not be disturbed, but will be continued to final hearing: Gemmell et al. v. Fox et al., 241 Pa. 146; Hoffman v. Howell, 242 Pa. 112; Bixler v. Swartz, 257 Pa. 300.\nAppeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
