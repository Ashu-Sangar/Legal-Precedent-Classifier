What he did do was nothing more than the equivalent of such action on his part. The money having gone into his own account was subject to be drawn out upon his personal checks which the bank could not refuse to pay. The question is entirely different from the one which would arise if after the deposit was made it was claimed as money of the trust and the bank was notified of the claim before it was paid, but that is not this case.\nJudgment affirmed."}
