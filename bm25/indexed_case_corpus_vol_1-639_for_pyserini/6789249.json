{"id": "6789249", "contents": "OPINION\nChief Justice SAYLOR.\nThis appeal concerns the scope of an employer\u2019s liability exclusion in an umbrella commercial liability insurance policy.\nLeola Restaurant maintained an umbrella commercial liability insurance policy with Appellant, Mutual Benefit Insurance Company, which contained an employer\u2019s liability exclusion. This exclusion prescribed, inter alia, that the policy did not provide coverage pertaining to liability for injury to \u201c[a]n \u2018employee\u2019 of the insured arising out of and in the course of ... [ejmployment by the insured[.j\u201d Complaint, Ex. C, Employer\u2019s Liability Exclusion. In addition, the policy contained a clause captioned \u201cSeparation of Insureds,\u201d which provided, subject to exceptions not relevant here, that \u201cthis insurance applies ... [sjeparately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought.\u201d Id. at Ex. C, \u00a7 V \u00b6 14(b) (emphasis in original).\nLeola Restaurant conducted its business on a property leased from Appellees Christos Politsopoulos and Dionysios Mihalopoulos (the \u201cProperty Owners\u201d). The lease required the Property Owners to be \u201cnamed as ... additional insured parties\u201d on the liability policy. Id. at Ex. E, \u00b6 1(d). While the Property Owners were not specifically designated on the declarations page of the umbrella policy, the instrument was designed to extend coverage to unidentified persons doing business with Leola Restaurant for whom the latter had agreed in writing to provide insurance. See id. at Ex. C, \u00a7 III \u00b6 2(f).\nIn December 2007, during the policy period, Appellee Marina Denovitz, an employee of Leola Restaurant, fell from an outside set of stairs and suffered injuries. She commenced a negligence action against the Property Owners in the common pleas court, asserting that they were negligent in maintaining the stairs in an unsafe and dangerous condition.\nThe Property Owners sought defense and indemnification from Appellant, per the umbrella policy. Appellant acknowledged that the Property Owners were insureds under the umbrella policy but nevertheless disclaimed coverage, invoking the employer\u2019s liability exclusion. Based on the policy\u2019s broad definition of \u201cinsured\u201d to encompass named insureds to include Leola Restaurant, Complaint, Ex. C, \u00a7 III \u00b6 1, it was Appellant\u2019s central position that Ms. Denovitz was an employee of \u201cthe insured,\u201d for purposes of the exclusion (albeit she was not an employee of the Property Owners, ie., the insureds against whom a claim had been asserted). The Property Owners, on the other hand, took the position that the exclusion was unclear, and coverage should be deemed to be negated only upon injury to an employee of the specific insured seeking coverage. In particular, the Property Owners pointed to the separation-of-insureds clause providing that coverage extends separately to each insured against whom claims are asserted.\nAppellant commenced a declaratory judgment action in an effort to vindicate its position that the exclusion pertained. Summary judgment was awarded in Appellant\u2019s favor, with the common pleas court \u2014 per the Honorable Jeffrey D. Wright \u2014 explaining that it was bound by precedent with which it did not agree, in particular, Pennsylvania Manufacturers\u2019 Association Insurance Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Insurance Co., 426 Pa. 453, 233 A.2d 548 (1967) [hereinafter, \u201cPMA \u201d].\nThe common pleas court explained that PMA\u2019s holding reflected that the term \u201cthe insured,\u201d as it appears in an employer\u2019s exclusion appearing in a liability policy, encompasses the named insured, regardless of whether coverage was sought by a different insured. Thus, the court reasoned, the exclusion prevented coverage from extending to redress harm to Ms. Denovitz, since she was an employee of the named insured (Leola Restaurant), and her injuries were occasioned in the course of such employment, even though suit was brought against additional insureds, i.e., the Property Owners.\nThe common pleas court also observed that the PMA Court rejected the argument that a severability-of-interests clause\u2014 which provided that \u201cthe term \u2018the insured\u2019 is used severally and not collectively,\u201d representing an analogue to the separation-of-insureds provision presently in issue \u2014 applied in a way that would undermine a broad application of the employer\u2019s liability exclusion relative to claims asserted by employees of a named insured. See id., 233 A.2d at 551.\nIn the common pleas court\u2019s view, however, absent the PMA overlay, the policy language used in both PMA and in the present case should be deemed ambiguous. The court continued to summarize several decisions of the Superior Court which, it believed, were consistent with such view and reflected a more apt treatment of insurance law. See, e.g., Maravich v. Aetna Life & Cas. Co., 350 Pa.Super. 392, 408-11, 504 A.2d 896, 905-06 (1986) (holding that a fire insurance policy exclusion eliminating coverage for losses deriving from \u201cneglect of the insured ... to save and preserve property\u201d applied only to defeat coverage relative to a neglectful insured and not any or all insureds (emphasis added)); McAllister v. Millville Mut. Ins. Co., 433 Pa.Super. 330, 338-41, 640 A.2d 1283, 1287-89 (1994) (distinguishing Maravich on the basis that the exclusionary terms in the policy at issue in McAllister applied by their terms more broadly to neglect by \u201can insured\u201d or \u201cany insured\u201d).\nHad it been free to discount PMA, the common pleas court explained, it would have implemented the following legal analysis centered upon the use of a definite article in conjunction with the term \u201cinsured\u201d in the umbrella policy\u2019s employer\u2019s liability exclusion:\nThe use of the phrase \u201cthe\u201d insured rather than \u201cany\u201d insured or \u201can\u201d insured, particularly in a policy which contains a severability of interests clause, demonstrates that the interests of the different insureds were intended to be several rather than joint. In other words, the policy, as written by Mutual Benefit, provides for coverage to [the Property Owners] separate and independent from that to [Leola Restaurant]. Since Denovitz was not an employee of \u201cthe\u201d insured Owners, the Employers\u2019 Liability Exclusion should not be applied to preclude coverage to [the Property Owners] under the Umbrella Policy. At the very least, the use of \u201cthe\u201d insured rather than \u201cthe named insured\u201d or \u201cany insured\u201d makes the term ambiguous, and thus necessarily interpreted against [Appellant], as the insurer.\nMut. Benefit Ins. Co. v. Politopoulos, No. CI-10-02578, slip op. at 9 (C.P. Lancaster Feb. 2, 2012) (emphasis in original).\nNotwithstanding this analysis and its point of view that PMA was \u201cflawed and outdated,\u201d id. at 10, the common pleas court considered itself bound by the decision. Accordingly, as noted, summary judgment was awarded in Appellant\u2019s favor.\nOn appeal, the Superior Court reversed in a published decision. See Mut. Benefit Ins. Co. v. Politopoulos, 75 A.3d 528 (Pa.Super.2013). In the opinion, initially, PMA was distinguished on the basis that the insureds seeking coverage in that case were not named insureds, whereas, according to the intermediate court, in the present case \u201cthe [Property] Owners undisputedly were named insureds under the Umbrella Policy.\u201d Id. at 535. The court then transitioned to a distinct proviso in the separation-of-insureds clause addressing named insureds and providing (subject to limited exceptions not applicable here): \u201c[T]his insurance applies ... [a]s if each named insured were the only named insured [.]\u201d Complaint, Ex. C, \u00a7 V \u00b6 14(a) (emphasis in original). Based on the unsupported pronouncement that the Property Owners were named insureds, see supra note 3, and the effect of the above language, the Superior Court reasoned that:\n[w]hen determining coverage as to any one insured, the policy must be applied as though there were only one insured, i.e., the one as to which coverage is to be determined.\nThe plain, unambiguous language of the \u201cSeparation of Insureds\u201d clause directs us to evaluate whether [the Property] Owners are insured under the Umbrella Policy as though they are the only named insured, an analytic conceit that is both clearer and stronger than a severability clause that simply identifies the insureds as \u201cseveral\u201d rather than \u201cjoint.\u201d In no uncertain terms, the policy language directs us to evaluate coverage as though Employer does not exist.\nAn insured who does not exist cannot employ anyone. Thus, if the person injured is not employed by the lone insured as to whom coverage is to be tested, the Employers\u2019 Exclusion simply does not come into play.\nPolitopoulos, 75 A.3d at 536-37 (emphasis in original).\nFinally, the Superior Court opined that its reading of the umbrella policy \u201cdovetails with the exclusivity of remedy for an employee under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d Id. at 537 (citing 77 P.S. \u00a7 481). In this regard, the court elaborated, the Property Owners do not enjoy the protection of the exclusivity-of-remedies provision of that enactment and, therefore, they had ample reason to seek to insure themselves against liability to employees of Leola Restaurant. See Politopoulos, 75 A.3d at 537.\nWe allowed appeal both to address the apparent deficit in the Superior Court\u2019s published opinion, see supra note 3, and to consider the scope of the exclusion in issue, particularly in light of the separation-of-insureds clause.\nInitially, Appellant complains of the Superior Court\u2019s material factual error in denominating the Property Owners named insureds under the terms of a policy which simply does not identify them as such on the declarations page or otherwise. See supra note 3. Furthermore, according to Appellant, the intermediate court \u201cmanufactured distinctions\u201d between the language of the policies at issue in PMA and the present case in order to circumvent this Court\u2019s precedent. Brief for Appellant at 12. Cf. Brown & Root Braun, Inc. v. Bogan, Inc., 54 Fed.Appx. 542, 546-49 (3d Cir.2002) (finding PMA controlling relative to operative policy terms, including a \u201cmodern\u201d separation-of-insureds clause, materially identical to those presently in issue). But see Arcelormittal Plate, LLC v. Joule Tech. Servs., Inc., 558 Fed.Appx. 205, 211 & n. 4 (3d Cir.2014) (reserving judgment concerning the breadth of PMA, in light of the Superior Court\u2019s decision in the present case). As a policy matter, Appellant finds the result of the Superior Court\u2019s decision to be incongruous, since it effectively results in an entity or individual qualifying as an additional insured attaining greater liability coverage than afforded to the named insured who actually purchased the policy. Id. According to Appellant, the opinion also undermines the exclusivity provisions of the WCA by making employers and their insurers pay twice for injuries to employees.\nAppellees, on the other hand, maintain that the separation-of-insureds clause is distinct from the severability-of-interests clause at issue in PMA and, therefore, must be afforded the meaning of the terms actually used, regardless of the propriety of the construction afforded to the language at issue in PMA. Cf. Brief for Amicus Pa. Ass\u2019n for Justice at 10 (\u201cThis [separation-of-insureds] clause acts to separate the insureds such that the Employer\u2019s Exclusion applies only to the insured employer not any insured under the policy.\u201d (emphasis in original)). In particular, Appellees note differences between a standard automobile liability insurance contract with an omnibus provision (extending coverage to persons using the insured vehicle with the permission of the named insured) and a commercial general liability policy extending coverage to those having written agreements with the named insured, especially in terms of the contractual basis for coverage pertaining to additional insureds in the latter scenario. Accord Ramara, Inc. v. Westfield Ins. Co., 298 F.R.D. 219, 228-29 (E.D.Pa. 2014) (\u201cWe agree with the reasoning in Politopoulos that PMA ... does not control where, as here, the additional insured is covered by virtue of a contract requiring coverage and where the separation of insureds clause contains language providing for an analytical framework whereby we are to consider each insured as if it is the only insured.\u201d). Further, Appellees contend that PMA does not contravene exclusivity under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, where the Property Owners do not enjoy the benefit of immunity under such enactment and had ample reason to insure themselves against such liability.\nSupplementing Appellees\u2019 arguments, their amici offer sharper focus. Initially, a group of insurance policyholders elaborate on the common pleas court\u2019s perspective concerning the use of the definite article \u201cthe\u201d \u2014 as opposed to an indefinite form such as \u201can\u201d or \u201cany\u201d \u2014 in connection with the word \u201cinsured.\u201d In this regard, the Policyholder Amici stress that, in various provisos, the policy at issue employs each of these phrases to achieve distinct aims and effects. For example, these amici observe the term \u201cthe insured\u201d is utilized in one proviso to articulate the insurer\u2019s indemnity obligations and rights respecting bodily injury and property damage, as follows:\nWe will indemnify the insured for ultimate net loss in excess of the retained limit because of bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies. We will have the right to associate with the underlying insurer and the insured to defend any claim or suit seeking damages for bodily injury or property damage to which this insurance applies.\nBrief for the Policyholder Amici at 7 (quoting Complaint, Ex. C, \u00a7 I \u00b6 1(a)) (emphasis in original). Self-evidently, the Policyholder Amici assert, \u201cthe insured\u201d in this passage refers to the particular insured against whom a claim has been asserted. Accord id. at 8 (\u201cThe provisions comprising the Insuring Agreement thus use the definite article (\u2018the\u2019) to refer to, qualify, and differentiate the specific insured as to whom the insurer has certain rights (i.e., to associate in the defense) and as to whom its indemnity obligations are triggered, due, and owing.\u201d). The Policyholder Amici contrast instances in which the policy employs the terms \u201can\u201d or \u201cany\u201d insured, which they believe reflects the intent to capture the broader range of insureds, for example, in the policy\u2019s pollution exclusion provisions. See Complaint, Ex. C, \u00a7 1 \u00b6 2(h)(1)(c) (excluding coverage relative to injury or damage relating to pollutants dispersed \u201c[a]t or from any premises, site or location which is or was at any time used by or for any insured\u201d (emphasis adjusted)).\nAmicus the Pennsylvania Association for Justice further contributes references to cases from other jurisdictions, concluding that the wide majority of jurisdictions take a narrower view of employer\u2019s liability exclusions pertaining to employees of \u201cthe insured.\u201d In particular, the Association highlights one federal court\u2019s depiction of Pennsylvania\u2019s contrary approach, as reflected in PMA, as being \u201carchaic and isolated in the context of the laws of the federal union.\u201d Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 472 F.Supp.2d 1183, 1203 (S.D.Cal.2007) (quoting, indirectly, Paul A. Freund, Chief Justice Stone and the Conflict of Laws, 59 Harv. L.Rev. 1210, 1216 (1946)); see also id. at 1202 (observing that, \u201c[i]n the current legal landscape, Pennsylvania belongs to a small minority of states that interpret employer\u2019s liability exclusions broadly to bar coverage for lawsuits brought by employees of any named insured\u201d).\nUpon our review, preliminarily, we find that the Superior Court\u2019s decision cannot be sustained on its terms, for the reasons explained by Appellant and set forth above. There simply is no basis in the umbrella policy to support the intermediate court\u2019s treatment of the Property Owners as named insureds. Furthermore, the court\u2019s broader analysis is clouded by this mislabeling and the court\u2019s corresponding invocation of an inapplicable subparagraph of the separation-of-insureds clause. Accord Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Holcim (US), Inc., 744 F.Supp.2d 1251, 1271 n. 28 (S.D.Ala.2010) (\u201cThe portion of [a separation-of-insureds] clause stating that the insurance applies \u2018as if each Named Insured were the only Named Insured\u2019 has no conceivable bearing\u201d on disputes involving persons and entities who are, at most, insureds or additional insureds but not named insureds (citation omitted)).\nIn considering the matter anew, we begin with the interrelationship between a separation-of-insureds clause and an employer\u2019s liability exclusion. As explained, generally a separation-of-insureds clause indicates that insurance applies separately to each insured against whom claim is made. See, e.g., Complaint, Ex. C, \u00a7 V \u00b6 14(b). As a general rule, neither a separation-of-insureds clause nor its analogue, a severabilityof-interests provision, is to be interpreted in a manner which would subvert otherwise clear and unambiguous policy exclusions. See, e.g., Holcim, 744 F.Supp.2d at 1271-72 & n. 29 (collecting cases and explaining that \u201ccourts from many jurisdictions have emphasized that a separation of insureds provision is not designed to, and does not have the effect of, negating plainly-worded exclusions\u201d); BP Am., Inc. v. State Auto Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 148 P.3d 832, 839411 & nn. 32-44 (Okla.2005) (\u201c[CJlearly most courts addressing the issue of whether a severability clause will render a clear and unambiguous exclusionary provision doubtful determine that the clear language of the exclusion must prevail.\u201d); Am. Wrecking Corp. v. Burlington Ins. Co., 400 N.J.Super. 276, 946 A.2d 1084, 1089 (App.Div.2008) (explaining that a separation-of-insureds clause does not create ambiguity, but merely spreads protection among insureds, without negating plainly-worded exclusions). This widely-accepted understanding is consistent with one facet of this Court\u2019s decision in PMA. See PMA, 426 Pa. at 459, 233 A.2d at 552 (commenting on the insignificance of modest variations among severability-of-interests clauses as compared with the importance of clarity in policy exclusions).\nAccordingly, the appropriate focus here is less upon the specific wording of the separation-of-insureds clause than on the terms of the employer\u2019s liability exclusion. See Holcim, 744 F.Supp.2d at 1271 (explaining that \u201cthe construction of [a separation-of-insureds] clause in conjunction with a particular contractual exclusion turns on the exclusion\u2019s precise wording\u201d); see also Abbeville Offshore Quarters Inc. v. Taylor Energy Co., 286 Fed.Appx. 124, 128 (5th Cir.2008). It is in this respect \u2014 namely, in the construction of the employer\u2019s liability exclusion under review \u2014 that PMA departed from the wider body of decisional law.\nConsistent with the explanation provided by Judge Wright of the common pleas court, and as further developed by the Policyholder Amici, a majority of jurisdictions recognize potential differences in meaning which may be taken from the selective use of definite and indefinite articles in association with the word \u201cinsured\u201d as employed in insurance policy exclusions. See, e.g., Postell v. Am. Family Mut. Ins. Co., 823 N.W.2d 35, 46 (Iowa 2012) (discussing instances in which an insurer \u201ccommunicate[s] that, under [a] policy, the term insured does not always mean \u2018any\u2019 insured person, but sometimes, only \u2018the\u2019 insured claiming coverage\u201d); Osbon v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., 632 So.2d 1158, 1160 (La.1994) (\u201cCourts in other jurisdictions generally focus on the article modifying the word \u2018insured,\u2019 specifically, \u2018the\u2019 insured, \u2018an\u2019 insured, and \u2018any\u2019 insured\u201d). Such potential differences, where recognized by the courts, have been taken to reflect ambiguities, thus requiring construction of salient policy language on the terms most favorable to the insured. Accord, e.g., Maryland Cas. Co. v. Am. Fidelity & Cas. Co., 217 F.Supp. 688, 691 (E.D.Tenn.1963) (questioning why, if an insurance company intended for \u201cthe insured\u201d to mean \u201cany insured,\u201d the insurer would not utilize the latter term).\nPMA departed from this line of reasoning, relying primarily on two cases arising in the automobile liability insurance setting: Patton v. Patton, 413 Pa. 566, 198 A.2d 578 (1964), and Great American Insurance Co. v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., 412 Pa. 538, 194 A.2d 903 (1963). See PMA, 426 Pa. at 458-59, 233 A.2d at 551-52. Both held that a household exclusion in a motor vehicle liability policy pertained to family members of named insureds seeking recompense from omnibus insureds, by virtue of the exclusion\u2019s direction to \u201cbodily injury to the insured or any member of the family of the insured residing in the same household as the insured.\u201d Patton, 413 Pa. at 570, 198 A.2d at 580; Great Am., 412 Pa. at 540-41, 194 A.2d at 904 (emphasis added). PMA bluntly transposed the usage from this discrete context (which particularity encompasses the coupling of \u201cthe insured\u201d with \u201cany member of the family of the insured\u201d) into the setting of an employer\u2019s liability exclusion. Such transposition, and the manner in which it was accomplished, suggests that PMA stands for the proposition that the term \u201cthe insured\u201d always signifies \u201call insureds\u201d (and thus encompasses the named insured even where no claim has been asserted against the named insured), regardless of contextual cues or comparative usage across the wider terms of a policy. This is why Judge Wright reasonably believed that he was bound to extend PMA\u2019s holding into the context of an employer\u2019s liability exclusion appearing in a commercial liability policy, although he strongly disagreed with PMA\u2019s approach as to such exclusion.\nUpon consideration of the broader range of authorities and the reasoning which they provide \u2014 which were not overtly considered in PMA \u2014 we decline to extend PMA\u2019s expansive construction of the term \u201cthe insured\u201d to an instance in which a commercial general liability policy variously makes use of the terms \u201cthe insured\u201d and \u201cany insured.\u201d Cf. Newman v. Mass. Bonding & Ins. Co., 361 Pa. 587, 591, 65 A.2d 417, 419 (1949) (explaining, in the interpretation of an insurance policy, \u201c[t]he court must give effect to every word that can be given effect\u201d). Rather, we are persuaded that, at least where a commercial general liability policy makes varied use of the definite and indefinite articles, this, as a general rule, creates an ambiguity relative to the former, such that \u201cthe insured\u201d may be reasonably taken as signifying the particular insured against whom a claim is asserted. Accord Windt, 3 Insurance Claims and Disputes \u00a7 11.14 (\u201cIf the exclusion is written to apply to an employee of the insured, as opposed to any insured, ... the exclusion should not apply to a claim against an insured entity that is not the employer.\u201d). Moreover, the separation-of-insureds clause, in this context, serves only to reinforce such an understanding. Accord Holcim, 744 F.Supp.2d at 1271 (collecting cases and explaining that \u201cthe distinction that surfaces time and again in the case law is that separation of insureds clauses affect interpretation of policy-exclusions using the term \u2018the insured\u2019 (essentially modifying that term to mean \u2018the insured claiming coverage\u2019), but have no effect on the interpretation of exclusions using the term \u2018an insured\u2019 or \u2018any insured.\u2019 \u201d); Postell, 823 N.W.2d at 46.\nIn summary, we conclude that the employer\u2019s liability exclusion in the umbrella policy is ambiguous. Application of governing principles of insurance policy construction yields the understanding that the ambiguous exclusionary language pertains only to claims asserted by employees of \u201cthe insured\u201d against whom the claim is directed, which understanding gains further support by reference to the policy\u2019s separation-of-insureds provision. Since the Property Owners are not Ms. Denovitz\u2019s employers, the employer\u2019s liability exclusion is inapplicable.\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed, albeit on different grounds.\nFormer Chief Justice CASTILLE and former Justice McCAFFERY did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustices BAER, TODD and STEVENS join the opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a concurring opinion.\n. Additionally, the Property Owners claimed to have the status of insureds under a separate business owners policy issued by Appellant. The present appeal, however, concerns only the umbrella policy.\n. The particular policy at issue in PMA was a motor vehicle liability policy.\n. The Superior Court provided no explanation for why it viewed the Property Owners as named insureds, when their names do not appear on the declarations page of the umbrella policy. Parenthetically, as noted, the lease between Leola Restaurant and the Property Owners did contemplate that the latter would be \"named\u201d as additional insureds in an appropriate policy. Complaint, Ex. E., \u00b6 1(d). The intermediate court, however, failed to address the apparent analytical gulf between the unconsummated \"naming\u201d of an additional insured and actual status as a named insured.\n.

Reliance Nat\u2019l Indem. Co., 99 F.Supp.2d 87, 101 (D.Me.2000) (determining that an employer's liability exclusion directed to claims asserted by employees of \"the insured\u201d did not apply to claims asserted by an individual who was not an employee of the particular insured against whom the claim was directed); Motorists Ins.

Co., 213 Mich.App. 114, 541 N.W.2d 272, 274-75 (1995)).\nParenthetically, in terms o\u00ed \"any insured\u201d exclusions, the main controversy appears to center, not on whether the term unambiguously implicates any or all insureds, but upon whether such meaning should be narrowed to the insured against whom a claim is asserted in light of a separation-of-insureds clause. See, e.g., Allan D. Windt, 3 Ins. Claims and Disputes \u00a7 11:8 (6th ed.2014) (framing the different lines of authority). The great majority of courts, however, merely apply the rule that a separation-of-insureds clause does not negate the effect of a plainly worded exclusion. Accord id. (citing cases and explaining that, \"as applied even independently to each insured, an \u2018any insured\u2019 exclusion unambiguously eliminates coverage for each and every insured\u201d).\n. The courts\u2019 task in insurance policy interpretation and construction is centered on ascertaining the intent of the parties to the agreement. See Madison Constr. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., 557 Pa. 595, 606, 735 A.2d 100, 106 (1999) (citing Gene & Harvey Builders v. Pennsylvania Mfrs. Ass\u2019n, 512 Pa. 420, 426, 517 A.2d 910, 913 (1986)). Consistent with ordinary principles of contract interpretation, where a policy provision is ambiguous, it is generally construed against the insurance company as the drafter of the agreement. See id. This precept dovetails with the approach, reflected in decisions of our intermediate courts, that policy exclusions are to be construed narrowly in favor of coverage. See, e.g., Eichelberger v. Warner, 290 Pa.Super. 269, 275, 434 A.2d 747, 750(1981).\n. Notably, the PMA Court took pains to solidify the position that the term \"the insured,\u201d as used in an employers' liability exclusion, consistently encompasses named insureds. See, e.g., PMA, 426 Pa. at 456, 233 A.2d at 550 (\u201c \u2018The insured\u2019 ... merely has been interpreted as the language dictates, to include the named insured.\u201d). Accordingly, although the PMA Court forcefully denied that it had equated the terms \"the insured\u201d and \"any insured,\u201d id. (\" \u2018The insured' has not been interpreted to mean \u2018an insured\u2019 or \u2018any insured.'\" (emphasis in original)), we are unable to discern any meaningful distinction between such permutations left in PMA\u2019s wake (at least on the specific terms of the decision). Indeed, while Appellant may not say so explicitly, its present argument rests on the notion that PMA effectively made \"the insured\u201d and \"any insured\u201d interchangeable. Accord Costco, 472 F.Supp.2d at 1203 (commenting on the broad impact of PMA relative to the meaning of \"insured\u201d in any given context).\n. We have framed the above proposition in terms of a general rule, because other indications and contextual cues appearing in an insurance policy may serve to render the meaning of \"the insured\u201d more apparent. This seems to be the case relative to the household exclusion appearing in vehicle liability policies, as construed in Patton and Great American. See Patton, 413 Pa. at 570, 198 A.2d at 580; Great Am., 412 Pa. at 540-41, 194 A.2d at 904. Notably, in this regard, these decisions are consistent with the majority view that such exclusion encompasses liability for injuries to family members of the named insured, regardless of whether the tortfeasor also is an insured under the salient vehicle liability policy. See generally Steven Plitt, Daniel Maldonado, Joshua D. Rogers, and Jordan R. Plitt, 8 Couch on Ins. \u00a7 114:48 (3rd ed. 2014) (\"The fact that the harm is caused by an omnibus insured does not affect the applicability of the policy exclusion of claims as to household members.\u201d (footnote omitted)).\nA collateral consequence of decisions such as PMA which take a less circumspect approach, resting broad-reaching conclusions on limited reasoning, is that they foster efforts toward avoidance in the intermediate courts, which are often problematic in their own right. Examples pertinent to the present setting include the Superior Court's decision under review, see supra note 3, and Luko v. Lloyd\u2019s London, 393 Pa.Super. 165, 176, 573 A.2d 1139, 1144 (1990). See Brown & Root Braun, 54 Fed.Appx. at 549 (observing that Luko \"fails to distinguish PMA adequately\u201d); Costco, 472 F.Supp.2d at 1202 (commenting that \"the Luko court disregarded PMA \").\n. Appellant also argues that the umbrella policy provided a specific avenue to afford protection to the Property Owners, namely, the creation of an \"insured contract\" serving as an express exception to the employer's liability exclusion. See Complaint, Ex. C, Employer\u2019s Liability Exclusion (rendering the clause inapplicable to \"liability assumed by the insured under an \u2018insured contract\u2019 \u2019\u2019). We disagree with Appellant\u2019s position, however, to the degree to which it suggests that such prescription alleviates the ambiguities arising from the remaining text of the exclusion.\nIn terms of Appellant\u2019s contentions grounded in social policy, we find that the policy concerns are mixed. In this regard, it is self-evident both that an insurance company legitimately would wish to focus upon the narrowest avenue of benefits relative to claims asserted by employees of a named insured (i.e., workers\u2019 compensation insurance), whereas, a lessor just as appropriately would seek to enjoy protection against the broadest range of claims (to include those asserted by employees of the lessee). Appellant's \"double payment\u201d argument downplays both this diversity in the interests present and the potential impact of an employer's subrogation rights relative to workers' compensation payments. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 671. Thus, we decline to afford the position controlling significance here."}
