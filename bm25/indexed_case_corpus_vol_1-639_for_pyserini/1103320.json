{"id": "1103320", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis is an appeal , by defendant from an order granting plaintiff a new trial, after verdict rendered in favor of defendant. The opinion of the court below sets forth a number of reasons in support of its order, but does not indicate, either expressly or otherwise, that these were the \u25a0 exclusive reasons for granting the new trial; under such circumstances, we will not interfere. In Feite v. Coll, 285 Pa. 151, 152, 153, we recently said: \u201cThe opinion of the court below does not conclusively show that the reasons there stated and discussed were the only ones which controlled the exercise of its discretion in ordering a new trial......Under such circumstances, we do not interfere with the judgment of the trial court.\u201d We also stated: \u201cThis court will not review an order granting a new trial unless the court below states it would have refused to grant the new trial but for reasons distinctly set forth, which, in its opinion, control the whole case.\u201d We. now repeat these statements in order that our position on such appeals may be made entirely clear.\nThe order is affirmed."}
