{"id": "1888581", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nIn view of our holding in the recent case of Wax v. Int. Mailers Union, 400 Pa. 173, it is clear that the court properly refused to take jurisdiction in the instant case. We there stated that \u201cour jurisdiction can only be sustained where the complaint is grounded solely on injury to the plaintiff\u2019s member-union relationship, and which complaint does not seek damages for \u2018back pay\u2019 as a result of interference by the union with employment rights, which remedy the N.L.R.B. is specifically empowered by Section 10(c) to grant in unfair labor practices cases.\u201d\nAlthough the plaintiff here complains of the Union\u2019s alleged misconduct, the real injury stressed, as resulting from the Union\u2019s misconduct, was the termination of the employer-employee relationship, for which he claims back pay. The matter thus falling arguably within the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board, the court below properly declined to take jurisdiction.\nThe facts in this case do not fall within the exceptions set forth in our most recent decision on the subject: Cosmark v. Struthers Wells Corp., 412 Pa. 211.\nAffirmed."}
