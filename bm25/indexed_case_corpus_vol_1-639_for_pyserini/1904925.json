{"id": "1904925", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThis is an appeal from an order refusing to set aside a sheriff\u2019s sale of real estate. A petition to set aside such a sale is addressed to the sound discretion of the court below and its decision will not be reversed on appeal, unless there is a gross abuse of that discretion. See Capozzi v. Antonoplos, 414 Pa. 565, 201 A. 2d 420 (1964). We find no abuse of discretion in this case.\nOrder affirmed."}
