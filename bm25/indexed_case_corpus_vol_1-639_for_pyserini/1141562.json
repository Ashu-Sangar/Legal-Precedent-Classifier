{"id": "1141562", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nPlaintiffs, husband and wife, sued in trespass to recover damages for alleged injuries to the wife, sustained in a fall on March 23, 1927, in defendant\u2019s store in the City of McKeesport. After verdict rendered for plaintiffs, the trial judge refused defendant\u2019s motion for judgment non obstante veredicto, but granted a new trial. Defendant appealed.\nThe alleged negligence on the part of defendant was in washing and oiling the floor of one of the aisles of the storeroom without \u201cpowdering\u201d the oiled space to render it reasonably safe for prospective customers. This condition was substantiated by plaintiffs\u2019 principal witness, one Morse, a colored man, who testified lie was the janitor or porter of the store at the time, and had washed and oiled the floor, but was called away to other duties before properly finishing the task. Inasmuch as plaintiffs could not recover without the testimony of the porter, \u2014Spickernagle v. Woolworth, 236 Pa. 496; Gorman v. Brahm\u2019s Sons, Inc., 298 Pa. 142,\u2014 appellant argues that it is entitled to judgment n. o. v. since that testimony was completely nullified by placing in evidence its records indicating Morse was not an employee of defendant on the date of the accident, citing Lessig v. Reading Transit Co., 270 Pa. 299, and Cubitt v. N. Y. C. R. R. Co., 278 Pa. 366. Appellant\u2019s contention that \u201cthe evidence of the payroll books is of the same value as maps and plans\u201d cannot be sustained. Employment sheets of this character are not official records, kept pursuant to law, and they may be successfully contradicted. Here, however, we have the testimony of defendant\u2019s bookkeeper that she kept the records of all employees and that Morse\u2019s name does not appear as an employee at the time the accident is alleged to have occurred; accordingly the records are admissible, not as decisive evidence under the circumstance here present, but for consideration with the other testimony by the jury. This is not a case for application of the \u201cphysical facts and mathematical tests\u201d doctrine. \u201cThe facts here are not of the kind included in the terms \u2018indisputable physical condition\u2019 nor do they furnish the basis for mathematical tests demonstratively overcoming the presumptions in plaintiff\u2019s favor\u201d: Talarico v. Baker Office Furniture Co., 298 Pa. 211, 215.\nThe award of a new trial rested within the sound discretion of the trial judge. In view of the many inconsistencies in the testimony offered by both sides, there was no abuse of that discretion.\nThe order of the court below refusing the motion for judgment non obstante veredicto and granting a new trial is affirmed."}
