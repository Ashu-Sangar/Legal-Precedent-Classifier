{"id": "993236", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Stewart,\nThe record in this case discloses no reason for the appeal, since the parties and the matters in dispute are exactly the same as in appeal No. 418 of this same term McPherson v. Cole, 240 Pa. 444, in which an opinion has just been handed down. The assignments of error are the same in each case. A like judgment of affirmance must be entered here.\nThe appeal is dismissed at costs of appellant."}
