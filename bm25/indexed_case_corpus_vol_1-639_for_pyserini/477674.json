{"id": "477674", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nAppellant, Robert Greer, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. On direct appeal to this Court appellant\u2019s appointed counsel requested permission to withdraw from further representation. We concluded that because the constitutional prerequisites to withdrawal had not been satisfied, withdrawal would not be permitted. Commonwealth v. Greer, 455 Pa. 106, 314 A.2d 513 (1974); see Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396 (1967); Commonwealth v. Baker, 429 Pa. 209, 239 A.2d 201 (1968). Counsel has now, in accordance with our earlier order, complied with the Anders-Baker standard and has been permitted to withdraw. Appellant has declined to supplement counsel\u2019s brief and we will therefore consider the merits of this appeal on the basis of that brief.\nWhen he pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, appellant waived the right to challenge anything but the legality of his sentence and the voluntariness of his plea. Commonwealth v. McNeill, 453 Pa. 102, 104, 305 A.2d 51, 53 (1973); Commonwealth v. Zanine, 444 Pa. 361, 363, 282 A.2d 367, 368 (1971); Commonwealth v. Stokes, 426 Pa. 265, 267-68, 232 A.2d 193, 194 (1967).\nThe sentence imposed \u2014 one and one-half to ten years imprisonment \u2014 was lawful. Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, \u00a7 703,18 P.S. \u00a7 4703 (1963) (now 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503 (1973), see 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103 (1973)). The only remaining inquiry is whether appellant\u2019s plea was voluntary.\nExamination of the extensive on-the-record colloquy indicates that appellant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily tendered his plea of guilty. See Commonwealth v. Bell, 449 Pa. 1, 2-3, 295 A.2d 307, 308-09 (1972); Commonwealth v. Zanine, supra, at 364, 282 A.2d at 368. See also Commonwealth v. Maddox, 450 Pa. 406, 300 A.2d 503 (1973); Pa. R. Crim. P. 319, 319A; ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Pleas of Guilty \u00a7\u00a7 1.4-.6 (Approved Draft, 1968); ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Function of the Trial Judge \u00a7\u00a7 4.1-.2 (Approved Draft, 1972).\nThe judgment of sentence is affirmed.\nAppellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp. 1974)."}
