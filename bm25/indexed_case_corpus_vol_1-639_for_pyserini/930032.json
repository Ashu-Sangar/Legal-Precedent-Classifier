{"id": "930032", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nThis is an appeal by the appellee in the preceding case from the refusal of the court to enjoin the use by the railway companies of 1,200 feet of tracks on South Delaware avenue in Minersville, which are a part of the line of the defendants\u2019 road that extends to Pottsville. These tracks were laid in 1873 by the People\u2019s Railway Company, a corporation chartered by act of assembly of April 4,1865, and since 1895 have been used by agreement by the Schuylkill Electric Railway Company. The People\u2019s Railway Company had the right to lay its tracks in the borough without municipal consent, and the fundamental question at the hearing was whether the defendants had exceeded their powers in entering into an agreement for the use or lease of the tracks. This question could be raised only by the commonwealth. It was properly held by the learned judge that \u201c whether any of the above companies exceeded their lawful authority by becoming a party to the contracts entered into, is a question of excessive exercise of power by a corporation, for which it is amenable to the commonwealth but not to a private suitor, or another corporation, unless such suitor has sustained a private injury, or such corporation has had its rights and franchises invaded. We hold that this plaintiff has not sustained such injury, and, as to that part of the road now under discussion, have no standing to maintain their bill:\u201d Western Pennsylvania Railroad Co.\u2019s Appeal, 104 Pa. 399.\nThe appeal is dismissed at the cost of the appellant."}
