{"id": "1141575", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nOn the audit of the account of the administrator d. b. n. in this estate, there was awarded to appellant the sum of $2,312.50. The orphans\u2019 court, in banc, sustained exceptions thereto, and, by its final decree, refused to award appellant anything. She then took this appeal, and claims that the court in banc should have confirmed the auditing judge\u2019s award of $2,312.50 to her. This is her only claim in this court.\nBy section 7 (d) of the Superior Court Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 212, 215, as supplemented and amended by section 2 of the Act of May 5, 1899, P. L. 248, 249, and as finally amended by the Act of March 2, 1923, P. L. 3, 4, it is provided \u201cThe said [Superior] court shall have......exclusive......appellate jurisdiction of all appeals which are now allowed to the Supreme Court in the following classes of eases: ...... Any single claim, any dispute, distribution, or other proceeding in the orphans\u2019 court, if the subject of the controversy be......money......and if also the amount or value thereof really in controversy in such single claim, dispute, or other proceeding be not greater than $2,500, exclusive of costs, and if also the claim, dispute, or other proceeding be not brought, authorized, or defended by the attorney general in his official capacity.\u201d Section 9 of the Act of 1895, P. L. 220, which has never been supplemented or amended, provides that \u201cIf an appeal is erroneously taken directly to the Supreme Court in any of the classes of cases made reviewable by the Superior Court, the Supreme Court shall not quash the appeal, but shall remit the ease at the costs of the appellant to the Superior Court for hearing and decision.\u201d\nThese statutes are decisive. Appellant has a \u201csingle claim\u201d of $2,312.50. Over her appeal, in respect of this, the Superior Court has exclusive appellate jurisdiction; and, since it was \u201cerroneously taken directly\u201d to this court, we must remit it, at her costs, to the Superior Court for hearing and decision. No authority is needed for so plain a case, but those interested may find an exhaustive consideration of the whole subject in McGlinn\u2019s Est, 270 Pa. 373.\nThis appeal is remitted to the Superior Court, at the costs of appellant."}
