{"id": "907066", "contents": "Pm Curiam,\nThis appeal is from the decree of the court below discharging the defendant\u2019s rule \u201c to show cause why the service of the bill of complaint in the above cause on John H. Klock,\u201d etc., \u201c should not be set aside.\u201d\nThe decree in question is clearly interlocutory, and no appeal lies therefrom to this or any other court at the present stage of the cause. The motion to quash must therefore be sustained.\nAppeal quashed, at appellant\u2019s costs, and record remitted with a procedendo.\n59"}
