{"id": "478367", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nOn January 29, 1972, at approximately 1:00 a.m., George Ware was fatally shot at a bar known as the \u201cS and C Lounge,\u201d located at 1326 West Girard Avenue, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by appellant, Andre Monroe. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence disclosed that prior to the shooting, one James McCoy and another man were seated at the bar when they were approached by two women, one of whom was appellant\u2019s sister. The women took seats next to the two men and ordered refreshments. A conversation started among the four, which ultimately became an insult match between appellant\u2019s sister and James McCoy. Appellant, who was present at the bar during the conversation, approached McCoy and demanded to know why McCoy had insulted his sister. The bartender, upon observing that appellant and McCoy were becoming angry, and noting that McCoy had a gun, asked the men to leave the bar in order to avoid trouble. They immediately complied. Approximately twenty minutes later, appellant returned to the bar and asked the bartender whether McCoy was still there. The bartender replied that he was not. Appellant was then approached by three men, one of whom was McCoy\u2019s brother-in-law, Gregory Ware. Ware identified himself as McCoy\u2019s brother-in-law, and asked appellant if he was looking for trouble. Appellant quickly drew a pistol and fired at Ware, causing his death. Appellant, waiving his pistol, then left the bar. He was subsequently arrested and convicted by a jury of murder in the second degree. After denial of his post-trial motions, appellant was sentenced to ten to twenty years in prison.\nAppellant, in this appeal, argues that the trial court erred when it refused to give appellant\u2019s requested charge relating to voluntary manslaughter. We agree.\nAt the time of appellant\u2019s trial, a defendant was not entitled to a charge of voluntary manslaughter, unless there was some evidence in the case which could support such a verdict. See Commonwealth v. Davis, 449 Pa. 468, 297 A.2d 817 (1972), Commonwealth v. Matthews, 446 Pa. 65, 285 A.2d 510 (1971). Now see Commonwealth v. Jones, 457 Pa. 563, 319 A.2d 142 (1974).\nWe believe that there was evidence which could support a verdict of voluntary manslaughter in this case. As previously related, the testimony disclosed that twenty minutes before the shooting, appellant had seen the victim\u2019s brother-in-law, McCoy, with a gun. Even though appellant did not take the stand, the jury could have inferred that when appellant saw Ware and two other men advance toward him in a threatening manner, appellant\u2019s act of quickly firing his gun might have been motivated by a fear that his life was in danger. Even if this fear were unreasonable, if it actually motivated appellant, his crime would be voluntary manslaughter, not murder. See Commonwealth v. Miller, 448 Pa. 114, 290 A.2d 62 (1972), Commonwealth v. Principatti, 260 Pa. 587, 104 A. 53 (1918).\nJudgment of sentence reversed and case remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia for a new trial.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones and Mr. Justice Eagen dissent.\nMr. Justice Manderino took no part in the consideration or decision of this case."}
