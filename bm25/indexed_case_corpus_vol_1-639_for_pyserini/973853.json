{"id": "973853", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe widow of the testator, for whose benefit he created the trust which she and their only surviving child wish to have terminated, is still alive. Who will be the ultimate distributees of the fund under the-will of her husband cannot be determined until her death, and the court below could not have made a decree terminating the trust without the consent of all parties in interest. Such parties were not before it, for some who may ultimately participate in the fund may not yet be in existence.\nDecree affirmed at appellants\u2019 costs."}
