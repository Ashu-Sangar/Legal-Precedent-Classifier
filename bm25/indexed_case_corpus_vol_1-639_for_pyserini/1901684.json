{"id": "1901684", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nThis is an appeal from judgments for defendants entered on their preliminary objections, in the nature of demurrers, to plaintiff-administrator\u2019s complaint.\nThe following, well pleaded, factual allegations must be taken as true for purposes of ruling on the demurrers. On or about October 1, 1961, Gloria Sewell, an aunt and next door neighbor of the infant decedent, Earl Brian Coakley, purchased a vaporizer-humidifier from defendant Wallace Preitz, trading as Hartsville Pharmacy. The device had been manufactured by defendant Northern Electric Company and distributed by defendant Rexall Drug Company. On January 27, 1962, the device was being used at decedent\u2019s residence, in accordance with its ordinary purpose, to relieve congestion in decedent\u2019s nose. Suddenly it shot boiling water on decedent\u2019s body causing his death on January 30, 1962.\nDecedent\u2019s administrator began an action of assumpsit, containing two counts, against all of the above named defendants for damages resulting from breaches of implied warranties of merchantability. The first count was brought under the \u201cWrongful Death\u201d statute and the second under the \u201cSurvival\u201d statute. All of the defendants filed preliminary objections, in the nature of demurrers, asserting that the implied warranties did not extend to decedent or, as often stated, that decedent was not in \u201cprivity of contract\u201d with defendants as required to support an action of assumpsit based upon a breach of implied warranty. The lower court sustained the demurrers and entered judgments for the defendants.\nOur determinations in this appeal are in the first instance restricted by the election of the administrator to frame this action in assumpsit.\nOn the basis of our decision in DiBelardino v. Lemmon Pharmacal Co., 416 Pa. 580, 208 A. 2d 283 (1965), the lower court properly sustained preliminary objections to plaintiff\u2019s \u201cWrongful Death\u201d count. In Lem mon Pharmacal we held that the right of action provided by the \u201cWrongful Death\u201d statute could be brought only in trespass and that, therefore, an action of assumpsit for breach of warranty was inappropriate. The holding was based upon the language of the \u201cWrongful Death\u201d statute which provides that the actionable wrong is \u201cdeath . . . occasioned by unlawful violence or negligence. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied).\nThe obstacle to bringing a breach of warranty action under the \u201cWrongful Death\u201d statute is not present under the \u201cSurvival\u201d statute. As we said in Pezzulli v. D\u2019Ambrosia, 344 Pa. 643, 647, 26 A. 2d 659, 661 (1942), the actions provided in these two statutes \u201care entirely dissimilar in nature. The [former] represents a cause of action unknown to the common law. . . . The [latter] is not a new cause of action at all, but merely continues in his personal representatives the right of action which accrued to the deceased. ...\u201d If decedent would have been entitled to maintain an assumpsit action for what the Uniform Commercial Code calls \u201cconsequential damages\u201d \u2014 \u201cinjury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty\u201d \u2014 then we see no reason why his personal representative could not do so on behalf of his estate under the \u201cSurvival\u201d statute. Thus, while a breach of warranty action cannot be brought under the \u201cWrongful Death\u201d statute it may be brought under the \u201cSurvival\u201d statute. The issue remains, however, whether decedent\u2019s lack of \u201cprivity\u201d to the warranties precludes the action.\nWith respect to this issue there are two main inquiries. The first is whether \u00a72-318 of the Uniform Commercial Code obviates the requirement of \u201cprivity\u201d with respect to the plaintiff.\nSection 2-318 provides: \u201cA seller\u2019s warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of his \"buyer or who is a guest in his home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Act of April 6, 1953, P. L. 3, \u00a72-318, 12A P.S. \u00a72-318. The comments to this section elaborate on its purpose and scope: \u201c2. The purpose of this section is to give the buyer\u2019s family, household and guests the benefit of the same warranty which the buyer received in the contract of sale, thereby freeing any such beneficiaries from any technical rules as to \u2018privity.\u2019 It seeks to accomplish this purpose without any derogation of any right or remedy resting on negligence. It rests primarily upon the merchant-seller\u2019s warranty under this Article that the goods sold are merchantable and fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used rather than the warranty of fitness for a particular purpose. Implicit in the section is that any beneficiary of a warranty may bring a direct action for breach of warranty against the seller whose warranty extends to him.\n\u201c3. This section expressly includes as beneficiaries within its provisions the family, household, and guests of the purchaser. Beyond this, the section is neutral and is not intended to enlarge or restrict the developing case law on whether the seller\u2019s warranties, given to his buyer who resells, extend to other persons in the distributive chain.\u201d Thus, if the decedent, \u201ca natural person,\u201d was connected with the \u201cbuyer\u201d, his aunt, in one or more of the ways set forth in \u00a72-318 then his lack of \u201cprivity\u201d is not a bar to a suit under the \u201cSurvival\u201d statute by his representative against his aunt\u2019s immediate seller, Wallace Preitz, trading as Hartsville Pharmacy.\nWith respect to this inquiry appellant contends that the decedent, being a nephew of the \u201cbuyer,\u201d was in her \u201cfamily,\u201d as that term is used in \u00a72-318, and, therefore, within the benefit of defendant Hartsville Pharmacy\u2019s implied warranty. The lower court held and appellees urge that the word \u201cfamily\u201d was meant by the Legislature to be used interchangeably with the word \u201chousehold\u201d and that since the decedent, who lived next door to his aunt, was not a member of her \u201chousehold\u201d he could not be in her \u201cfamily.\u201d In our opinion such a construction is erroneous. The word \u201cfamily\u201d appears in the phrase \u201cany natural person who is in the family or household of his buyer or who is a guest in his home.\u201d Obviously, the clause \u201cguest in his home\u201d has significance different from and independent of the clause \u201cperson ... in the . . . household.\u201d It would seem also that the clause \u201cperson . . . in the family\u201d has significance different from and independent of the clause \u201cperson ... in the . . . household\u201d rather than being mere surplusage. The use of the conjunction \u201cor\u201d strengthens the natural conclusion that \u201cfamily\u201d and \u201chousehold\u201d have different meanings in this statute.\nOur interpretations of the word \u201cfamily\u201d in Shank Estate, 399 Pa. 656, 161 A. 2d 47 (1960); Way Estate, 379 Pa. 421, 109 A. 2d 164 (1954), and Beilstein v. Beilstein, 194 Pa. 152, 45 Atl. 73 (1899), do not support the lower court\u2019s construction. Not only were the contexts in which the word was used in those cases very different from the present context but also the meanings ascribed to the word \u201cfamily\u201d in those cases were not limited to the meaning of the word \u201chousehold.\u201d\nThe statute provides no clear indication of the meaning to be given to the word \u201cfamily,\u201d and we have found no case on the matter. In our opinion, considering the remedial nature of the provision and the natural connotations of the word, its meaning was not intended to be unduly restrictive. Accordingly, we hold that the word \u201cfamily\u201d as used in this statute includes the nephew of the purchaser. This interpretation of the word \u201cfamily\u201d is not too burdensome on the seller who makes the warranty because not only must the beneficiary be in the buyer\u2019s family but also it must be \u201creasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goods. . . .\u201d Whether this member of the family was also within the latter clause is a factual and objective question and depends upon all the relevant circumstances, which may include such factors as the remoteness of the family relation, the geographical connection between the buyer and the member of his family, and the nature of the product.\nBecause decedent was in the buyer\u2019s \u201cfamily\u201d, \u00a72-318 supports his representative\u2019s action against defendant Preitz, notwithstanding decedent\u2019s lack of privity. Therefore, it was error to sustain said defendant\u2019s demurrer to plaintiff\u2019s second count. Of course, the pertinent factual matters must be proven before recovery may be had.\nSection 2-318 designates those persons who may sue. The second inquiry, therefore, is whether there is any rule of case law permitting the persons designated in \u00a72-318 to maintain an action of assumpsit against remote sellers. . With respect to this inquiry a consideration of the case law is pertinent and it is necessary to determine whether defendants\u2019 lack of \u201cprivity\u201d is a bar thereunder. Much has been written regarding the demise of the requirement of \u201cprivity of contract\u201d in implied warranty actions, and, indeed, its demise is plainly evident in some jurisdictions. See, e.g., Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., 32 N.J. 358, 161 A. 2d 69 (1960). Cf. Suvada v. White Motor Co., 32 Ill. 2d 612, 210 N.E. 2d 182 (1965). But it is plain from Hochgertel v. Canada Dry Corporation, 409 Pa. 610, 187 A. 2d 575 (1963), that the requirement still has great vitality in Pennsylvania. The following excerpts from Hochgertel are pertinent:\n\u201cThe general rule in the United States is that the mere resale of a warranted article does not give a sub-purchaser the right to sue the manufacturer in assumpsit, on the basis of breach of warranty, for damages incurred by him due to a defect in the quality of the goods. Pennsylvania decisions are in accord with this general proposition. The warranty is personal to the immediate or original buyer, and he alone may avail himself of the benefit thereof. This limitation is based oh the rule of privity of contract. . . .\n\u201cHowever, nearly a third of the American jurisdictions, including Pennsylvania, have broken away from the rule of \u2018privity of contract\u2019 in cases involving food, beverages and like goods for human consumption, and have for various stated reasons permitted a subpurchaser to sue the manufacturer directly in assumpsit for breach of an implied warranty that the food was wholesome and fit to eat. . . .\n\u201cA \u2019 close study of [the Pennsylvania food cases] will disclose that the courts did not therein outrightly reject the \u2018privity of contract\u2019 rule, but extended the obligation of the manufacturer to the subpurchaser in such instances upon the . . . demands of \u2018social justice\u2019. . . .\n\u201cIn no case in Pennsylvania has recovery against the manufacturer for breach of an implied warranty been extended beyond a purchaser in the distributive chain. In fact, the inescapable conclusion from Loch v. Confair, 361 Pa. 158, 63 A. 2d 24 (1949), is that no warranty will be implied in favor of one who is not in the category of a purchaser [except in cases covered by \u00a72-318 of the Code].\u201d We went on to hold in Hochgertel that a bartender-employee who was injured by an exploding bottle of soda water could not bring an implied warranty action against the defendant who had bottled and sold the soda water to plaintiff\u2019s employer.\nIn light of the discussion and holding of Hochgertel it seems plain that under the developing case law decedent was not within the benefits of any implied warranties made by the remote sellers. This necessarily follows from the fact that he was not a \u201cpurchaser.\u201d Even if he were a \u201cpurchaser\u201d the product involved would not bring him within the rule that a \u201cpurchaser\u201d can sue a remote seller only in cases involving \u201cfood, beverages, and like goods for human consumption.\u201d\nYentzer v. Taylor Wine Company, 414 Pa. 272, 199 A. 2d 463 (1964), another exploding bottle case, merely held that the plaintiff-employee was actually a \u201cbuyer\u201d or \u201cpurchaser\u201d and since the defective product Avas a food or beverage he could sue a remote seller on an implied warranty.\nIt must be emphasized that all we have said Avith regard to the requirement of \u201cprivity of contract\u201d and the requirement of a family relationship applies only to actions of assumpsit for breach of implied warranty under the Uniform Commercial Code. The \u201cprivity\u201d requirement has long been abandoned in Pennsylvania in actions of trespass for negligently caused injuries. See Foley v. The Pittsburgh-Des Moines Co., 363 Pa. 1, 28-30, 68 A. 2d 517, 530-532 (1949). Furthermore, we recognize the social policy considerations behind imposing strict liability in tort upon all those who make or market any kind of defective product, notwithstanding an absence of negligence on their part. A similar result would follow from abandoning the requirement of \u201cprivity of contract\u201d in warranty actions.\nHowever, the latter course, the one decedent\u2019s administrator has directed this Court upon, is not freely open to us. We are circumscribed by the limitations on strict liability in assumpsit set forth in the Uniform Commercial Code. The comment to the Code, quoted above, which is the basis for the argument that the language of \u00a72-318 is precatory only was never enacted by the Pennsylvania Legislature. Such considerations, we believe, do not limit the development of the law in trespass. The concurring and dissenting opinion, which would remand or amend the pleadings in this action to trespass, fails to note that appellant has not sought such relief here. Indeed, the record discloses that an action of trespass has also been filed by the administrator. Therefore, an amendment by us would be improper. As a result, a determination of law as to strict liability for defective products in a trespass action must await an appropriate case.\nJudgments for defendants Northern Electric and Rexall Drug affirmed and judgment for defendant Theodore Preitz, trading as Hartsville Pharmacy, reversed with a procedendo.\nActs of April 15, 1851, P.
