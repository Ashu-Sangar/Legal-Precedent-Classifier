{"id": "568979", "contents": "Per Curiam::\nIn the class of cases to which this appeal belongs, we purposely abstain from any expression of opinion as to the merits of the case, for the reason that the facts are not fully before us. The only question, now presented, is, whether the preliminary injunction should have been granted. As at present advised, we are not satisfied that the court below erred in refusing to grant it.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs.\nMr. Justice Mitchell dissented."}
