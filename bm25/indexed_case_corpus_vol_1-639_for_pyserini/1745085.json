{"id": "1745085", "contents": "OPINION\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nAppellant, Hellertown Manufacturing Company, is a Delaware corporation authorized to do business in Pennsylvania. Appellant filed its Pennsylvania corporate net income tax return in 1971 pursuant to the Tax Reform Code of 1971, Act of March 4, 1971, P.L. 6, Art. I, \u00a7 101, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7 7201 (Supp.1978) indicating a tax liability of $77,745. Appellee, the Commonwealth, in determining appellant\u2019s corporate net income tax, increased the tax to $111,818.34. The Board of Finance and Revenue ordered a resettlement with a taxation figure of $107,976.24. The Commonwealth Court affirmed this resettlement, and appellant exercised its right of appeal to this Court. See The Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 203, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.203 (Supp.1978).\nThe controversy in this case is whether the Secretary of Revenue may utilize a method of determining business income taxable by Pennsylvania which excludes appellant\u2019s sales in states in which the appellant is not jurisdictionally subject to corporate taxes. Excluding such sales results in a greater apportionment percentage and thus a greater net income tax liability. The Commonwealth Court found this method to be permissible under Article IV of the Tax Reform Code, 72 P.S. \u00a7 7401(3)2(a)(18), when the statutory method of apportioning the taxpayer\u2019s income does not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in Pennsylvania. Hellertown Manufacturing Co. v. Commonwealth, 25 Pa.Cmwlth. 90, 358 A.2d 424 (1976). We agree and therefore affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.\nWhen the entire business of a corporation such as appellant is not transacted within Pennsylvania, the Tax Reform Code of 1971 provides that the portion of corporate net income taxable by Pennsylvania may be determined by multiplying the corporation\u2019s total net income by an apportionment percentage which is the average of three statutory fractions (property, payroll and sales). 72 P.S. \u00a7 7401(3)2 (Supp.1978). The parties agree that the property fraction equals 100% since all of the appellant\u2019s tangible property is located in Pennsylvania. They further agree that the payroll fraction equals 100% because all of appellant\u2019s employees are also located within the Commonwealth. The dispute concerns the sales fraction.\nAppellant computed the sales fraction by following the Tax Reform Code formula which provides:\n\u201cThe sales factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer in this State during the tax period, and the denominator of which is the total sales of the taxpayer everywhere during the tax period.\u201d 72 P.S. \u00a7 7401(3)2(a)(15) (Supp.1978).\nSince the appellant\u2019s sales in Pennsylvania were quite small in comparison to its total sales, computing the sales fraction under the above provision yielded a sales fraction of less than 1%. Had appellee used this sales fraction, it would have resulted in the reduction of appellant\u2019s taxable income by approximately one-third.\nAppellee, finding appellant\u2019s sales fraction of less than one per cent to be grossly disproportionate when compared to the 100% figures of payroll and property, determined that the apportionment percentage yielded by the average of the sales, property and payroll factors did not fairly represent the extent of Hellertown\u2019s business activity in Pennsylvania. It therefore relied upon subsection (a)(18) which allows an alternative computation of the sales fraction. The subsection provides:\n\u201cIf the allocation and apportionment provisions of this definition do not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this State, the taxpayer may petition the Secretary of Revenue or the Secretary of Revenue may require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity:\n(A) Separate accounting;\n(B) The exclusion of any one or more of the factors;\n(C) The inclusion of one or more additional factors which will fairly represent the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this State; or\n(D) The employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment of the taxpayer\u2019s income. (Emphasis added.)\n72 P.S. \u00a7 7401(3)2(a)(18) (Supp.1978).\nAlthough appellee could have, under part B of. subsection (a)(18), completely excluded the sales factor, thus leaving an apportionment percentage of 100%; it instead recomputated the sales factor under part D of subsection (a)(18) which permits \u201c[t]he employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation ... of the taxpayer\u2019s income.\u201d Appellee employed a method known as the \u201cthrow out\u201d rule in recomputing the sales figure. This rule eliminated from the denominator of the sales fraction. Heller-town\u2019s receipts from sales made in states in which Heller-town was not jurisdictionally subject to corporate taxes. The subtraction of these sales in states which did not have the requisite jurisdiction to impose a tax on net income from the sales fraction denominator mathematically adjusted the sales fraction to approximately 96%. This resulted in a computation by appellee of Hellertown's taxes of $107,976.24 as compared to appellant\u2019s claim of tax liability of $77,-745.00.\nAppellant argues that the relief provisions of subsection (a)(18) may only be applied in extremely limited circumstances. Other states which have taxing codes similar to ours (this portion of the Pennsylvania statute was adopted almost verbatim from the language contained in the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act) are divided as to precisely when this subsection may be invoked. In Donald M. Drake Co. v. Dept. of Revenue, 263 Or. 26, 500 P.2d 1041 (1971), the Oregon Supreme Court limited the use of the relief provision to \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d See also Amoco Production Co. v. Armold, 213 Kan. 636, 518 P.2d 453 (1974). Conversely, in Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Commission, 27 Utah 2d 119, 493 P.2d 632 (1972), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 973, 93 S.Ct. 323, 34 L.Ed.2d 237, reh. den., 409 U.S. 1093, 93 S.Ct. 678, 34 L.Ed.2d 678 (1972) the Supreme Court of Utah allowed the use of the relief section in a case where the disparity between the property and payroll factors and the sales factor was less than that which exists in appellant\u2019s case.\nWe begin our analysis by an examination of the precise language of subsection (a)(18). The legislature provided that the Secretary of Revenue could vary the method of calculating the sales fraction when the statutory formula did not yield a taxable income \u201cfairly\u201d representative of \u201cthe extent of the taxpayer\u2019s business activity in this State . .\u201d Therefore, appellee may employ the \u201cthrow out\u201d rule to recompute the sales fraction only if the 67% apportionment figure sought to be used by appellant is not \u201cfairly\u201d representative of appellant\u2019s \u201cbusiness activity\u201d in Pennsylvania.\nIf only 67% of appellant\u2019s \u201cbusiness activity\u201d is in Pennsylvania, the remainder must occur in other states. Since 100% of appellant\u2019s property and employees are located in Pennsylvania, it is the sales portion which constitutes the out-of-state \u201cbusiness activity.\u201d The theory behind appellant\u2019s argument is that the remainder of its \u201cbusiness activity\u201d occurs in those states in which it sells nearly all of its products. While it is true that appellant has structured itself so that most of its sales occur in states other than Pennsylvania, the reality of the situation is that Hellertown does not pay corporate taxes in any other state (with the exception of Ohio where it paid the minimum franchise tax of $50.00 per year). These other states in which appellant made the bulk of its sales, and to which it now seeks to apportion nearly one-third of its business income, cannot tax appellant unless some local incident (\u201cbusiness activity\u201d) occurred within the state. The United States Supreme Court has held that there must be at least minimal connections between a state and the potential taxpayer selling goods in the state in order to establish a jurisdictional nexus justifying the imposition of a tax. See National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 386 U.S. 753, 87 S.Ct. 1389, 18 L.Ed.2d 505 (1967). Since Hellertown did not have sufficient minimum connections to establish a jurisdictional presence for purposes of taxation, we cannot accept its argument that the remainder of its \u201cbusiness activity\u201d occurred in these states.\nThe Tax Reform Code permits appellant to apportion its taxable income to other states so as to divide appellant\u2019s tax liability among those states which impose or could impose corporate taxes. The Code provides:\n\u201cFor purposes of allocation and apportionment of income . . ., a taxpayer is taxable in another state if . he is subject to a . . . tax, or that state has jurisdiction to subject the taxpayer to a net income tax regardless of whether, in fact, the state does or does not.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\n72 P.S. \u00a7 7401(3)2(a)(3) (Supp.1978).\nThus, the critical factor is not whether the other state actually imposes a tax but whether the other state has jurisdiction to impose a tax. It is illogical to permit appellant to apportion income to other states in which it has no jurisdictional business activity. Apportioning the net income of a corporation which conducts some business outside of Pennsylvania insures that no corporate taxpayer pays more than its fair share; it conversely should not permit any corporation to escape paying its fair share.\nAppellant does not challenge the constitutionality of subsection (a)(18) or any other portion of the Tax Reform Code. Compare Moorman Manufacturing Co. v. Bair, 437 U.S. 267, 98 S.Ct. 2340, 57 L.Ed.2d 197 (1978). Rather, appellant contends that appellee\u2019s method of determining the sales fraction \u2014 the \u201cthrow out\u201d rule \u2014 is not valid under subsection 18. It argues that since a legislative report (The Fineman Report) specifically rejected the \u201cthrow back\u201d rule, the tax administrator may not adopt the \u201cthrow out\u201d rule which achieves mathematically similar results. (The \u201cthrow back\u201d rule adds into the numerator the sales made to states in which the corporation does not pay taxes.)\nThis reasoning, however, ignores the plain language of subparagraph 18, which lists four ways in which either the taxpayer or the Secretary of Revenue may compute taxable income when the statutory apportionment provisions do not fairly represent the level of a corporation\u2019s Pennsylvania business activity. Indeed, the Code quite clearly states that \u201cany other method to effectuate an equitable allocation and apportionment\u201d may be utilized. 72 P.S. \u00a7 7401(8) 2(a)(18)(D) (Supp.1978). No mention was made of either \u201cthrow back\u201d or \u201cthrow out\u201d and no restrictions were placed upon the Secretary of Revenue as to what methods could or could not be employed, as long as the method used \u201ceffectuates an equitable allocation and apportionment\u201d of the taxpayer\u2019s income.\nAppellant would have us invalidate the \u201cthrow out\u201d rule based upon legislative history. We may resort to legislative history, however, only when the words of a law are not explicit. Statutory Construction Act, Act of Dec. 6, 1972, P.L. 1339, No. 290, \u00a7 3, 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1921 (Supp.1978). See also Martins Estate, 365 Pa. 280, 74 A.2d 120 (1950); Daugherty v. Continental Can Co., Inc., 226 Pa.Super. 342, 313 A.2d 276 (1973). When the statute\u2019s meaning is plain, as is this section of the Tax Reform Code, we cannot look to legislative history when to do so would alter that statute\u2019s plain meaning. The Commonwealth Court refused to make the Fineman Report part of the record and further commented that \u201cthere is no proof that all of the recommendations in the exhaustive report were eventually adopted by the Legislature.\u201d 25 Pa.Cmwlth. at 100-01, 358 A.2d at 429-30.\nIn conclusion we find that where a corporation such as appellant manufactures all of its products in Pennsylvania, has all of its tangible property and employees in Pennsylvania and is not subject to the taxing jurisdiction of any other state, excepting one, the Secretary of Revenue may recalculate the sales fraction to yield an allocation of business income which is representative of appellant\u2019s business activity in Pennsylvania. The Secretary of Revenue did nothing more in this case.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nPOMEROY, J., dissents."}
