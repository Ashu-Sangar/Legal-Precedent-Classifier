{"id": "1762398", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nAppellant, Robert Louis Joyner, and his co-defendant, Andre Shaw, were charged with criminal attempt and possession of implements for escape. While his co-defendant was acquitted, appellant was found guilty by a jury on both charges. The Superior Court affirmed the convictions per curiam. We granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal and we affirm.\nInitially, appellant contends the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions. We must review the evidence in a light most favorable to the verdict winner, in this case, the Commonwealth. To find the evidence is insufficient it must be determined that accepting as true all of the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom, upon which, if believed, the jury could properly have based its verdict, it would be nonetheless insufficient in law to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant is guilty of the crimes of which he has been convicted. Evidence may still be found sufficient even though it be wholly circumstantial. Commonwealth v. Holzer, 480 Pa. 93, 389 A.2d 101 (1978).\nA review of the evidence at trial, read in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, reveals the following. The Captain of the Guard at the State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh observed co-defendant Shaw at the door of his cell and shortly thereafter on his bed. On further inspection, the guard observed a hole in the ceiling and an alteration of the light fixture. Then three persons with ski masks emerged from under the bed and ran out of the cell. A resident wearing a brown ski mask was seen running into cell M-4 and five minutes later guards brought appellant out of that cell. One of the guards testified that when he entered the cell he saw appellant sitting on a mattress breathing heavily and found the brown mask on a shelf in a cabinet in the cell. This guard further testified that appellant was the only inmate in the cell at this time.\nShaw\u2019s cell showed signs of an attempt to knock a hole through the concrete ceiling with the aid of an electric drill. Witnesses told of seeing about 35 drill holes in the ceiling, a \u201chole\u201d measuring about 8 inches X 18 inches, bits of concrete on the floor, the cell furniture in disarray, mirrors fastened to sticks, a pair of pliers, and the ceiling light fixture loosened and moved from its original location. The Vi\" electric drill and bit were found on top of the light fixture. The three men who rushed out of Shaw\u2019s cell wore ski masks apparently made from sweater sleeves and the Guard Captain said they were golden or brown in color. The Commonwealth produced a brown mask as its Exhibit No. 6 and witnesses identified it as the one found in appellant\u2019s cell. Appellant did not testify on his own behalf nor did he present any witnesses.\nWe agree there was sufficient evidence to warrant the convictions.\nAppellant\u2019s second allegation of error is that he was denied effective assistance of counsel due to a conflict resulting from dual representation at the trial of co-defendant Shaw and appellant by the same attorney. The mere existence of a conflict of interest vitiates the proceedings, but appellant has the burden of demonstrating that a conflict of interest actually did exist. Dual representation alone does not amount to a conflict of interest. Appellant need not show that actual harm resulted, but he must at least show the possibility of harm. Commonwealth v. Breaker, 456 Pa. 341, 318 A.2d 354 (1974).\nAt trial, co-defendant Shaw took the stand in his own defense, denying any involvement in the escape attempt and any knowledge about the tools found in his cell. He also presented an alibi defense. On the other hand, appellant\u2019s defense was premised on a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. Appellant argues that counsel neglected his defense to give his co-defendant a more spirited defense. After a careful review of the record we conclude this argument is totally without merit.\nAppellant also asserts that the discrepancy in the quality of the defenses presented on behalf of these co-defendants constitutes a conflict of interest. While the law does not require appellant to make an affirmative showing of prejudice, it must at least appear from a consideration of the record that a conflict in fact existed. Here neither defendant relied on any defense which was at all antagonistic to that of the other. Co-defendant Shaw did take the stand in his own defense but his defense can in no way be said to have been at appellant\u2019s expense. The mere fact that defenses vary does not amount to a conflict of interest.\nWe affirm the Order of the Superior Court of Pennsylvania at No. 78 April Term, 1978, affirming the Judgment of Sentence entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Criminal Division on July 8, 1977, at No. CC7607124AO.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Counsel actively conducted appellant\u2019s defense, having filed motions to suppress, to quash information, and in arrest of judgment or for a new trial; questions for voir dire and points for charge; and engaged in the cross-examination of witnesses.\n. We distinguish U. S. ex rel. Sullivan v. Cuyler, 593 F.2d 512, (3d Cir. 1979) from the instant case. In that case, after stating in his opening statement that counsel would offer to produce evidence on defendant\u2019s behalf, counsel rested at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case without presenting said defendant\u2019s testimony or other evidence. Counsel testified that this strategy was based, in part, on his reluctance to prematurely disclose the defense of the other two co-defendants. Counsel further testified that he failed to produce a witness who was also a co-defendant because of his duty to protect the co-defendant against possible self-incrimination.\nIn the present case, appellant merely alleges that the co-representation was prejudicial, but fails to point to any specifics."}
