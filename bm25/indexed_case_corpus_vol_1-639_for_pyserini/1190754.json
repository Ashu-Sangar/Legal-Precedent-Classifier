{"id": "1190754", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Schaffer,\nPlaintiff makes a sausage which it labels \u201cNOLINK,\u201d defendant one which it brands \u201cLONG LINK.\u201d Plaintiff seeks to enjoin the use by defendant of the designation \u201cLONG LINK,\u201d on the ground that the words violate its trade-mark and constitute unfair competition.\nThe chancellor dismissed the bill, mainly on the ground that the terms used were not deceptively similar. Prom the decree of dismissal plaintiff appeals.\nAppellant contends that its name \u201cNOLINK\u201d is a distinctive trade name and that it has a method of using this name in stamping and advertising which defendant largely imitates. It is alleged that defendant is marking its commodity with the name \u201cLONG LINK\u201d in the same color of ink, same size of type, and in the same position on the sausages as plaintiff, all of which is emphasized in the latter\u2019s advertising. Plaintiff\u2019s sausage is stuffed into gut containers but has no links, defendant\u2019s is similarly contained, but the links are long, twelve inches. When exposed for sale, plaintiff\u2019s sausage is curled in rings in the cartons, defendant\u2019s lies straight.\nAn inspection of the exhibits attached to the record does not give us the impression, that an ordinarily observant person would be misled as to which sausage he was buying by the legend on the cartons, or the branding of the sausage itself. On the one carton appears \u201cPETERS NOLINK PURE PORK SAUSAGE\u201d and \u201cPETERS PACKING CO\u2019S NOLINK PORK SAUSAGE\u201d;\non the other \u201cDELICIOUS BRAND LONG LINK HOME MADE PORK SAUSAGE MANUFACTURED EXCLUSIVELY BY OSWALD & HESS CO.\u201d On the sausage itself is stamped in the one instance the single word \u201cNOLINK\u201d and in the other the two words \u201cLONG LINK.\u201d The curled sausage in the one differs entirely in appearance from the straight sausage in the other, as the appended copies of the photographs show. Each is readily distinguishable from the other. The words \u201cLONG LINK\u201d and the coined one \u201cNOLINK\u201d are so different in appearance and in their implications that even \u201che who runs,\u201d reading, would appreciate the difference. No one would be misled into thinking the one was the other who could read, and he who could not would understand neither.\nIn Quaker State Oil Refining Co. v. Steinberg, 325 Pa. 273, 189 A. 473, and in the more recent case of Stroehmann Bros. v. Manbeck Baking Co., 331 Pa. 96, 200 A. 97, we have had occasion to review the principles governing controversies such as this, and they need not be repeated; it is sufficient to say that no deception was shown, and it was not demonstrated that there is likelihood that the public will be confused in the belief that defendant\u2019s product is that of plaintiff.\nPlaintiff assigns for error the rulings of the court below on the introduction of certain evidence. Plaintiff called as a witness a meat dealer, and attempted to prove by him that, if plaintiff\u2019s sausage was cut in strips and placed lengthwise in a tray, and defendant\u2019s brand was likewise displayed, the public would be confused between the two. There was evidence that some dealers utilized this method of display. Defendant\u2019s packages are so arranged that its sausage can be displayed in the package itself. The mere fact that certain dealers might market the sausage in such a way as to cause confusion would not entitle plaintiff to the relief here requested: Phila. Dairy Products v. Quaker City Ice Cream Co., 306 Pa. 164, 159 A. 3. For the same reason, the court properly excluded evidence to the effect that certain dealers had palmed off the defendant\u2019s product as that of plaintiff. \u201cIf there was any such effort to deceive the public, the dealers to whom the defendant sold its product and not defendant itself were legally responsible for it\u201d: Phila. Dairy Products v. Quaker City Ice Cream Co., supra, at p. 173.\nThe decree is affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost."}
