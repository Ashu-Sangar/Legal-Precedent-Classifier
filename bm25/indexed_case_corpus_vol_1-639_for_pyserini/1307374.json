{"id": "1307374", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin B. Jones,\nDid the court below abuse its discretion in granting a new trial?\nOn March 22, 1957, in the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County, Mary E. Wolfe instituted a malpractice action against Dr. Paul P. Biggie. The matter was tried before Judge D. H. Weiner and a jury and, after a trial lasting well over a week, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Dr. Biggie and against Miss Wolfe.\nWithin less than twenty-four hours after the verdict, Judge Weiner made an order granting a new trial and assigning his reasons therefor. This order was entered ex parte: no notice whatsoever was given either to the parties or their counsel and no motion for a new trial had been made on behalf of Miss Wolfe.\nIn Judge Weiner\u2019s order he specifically set forth why he granted a new trial: (1) after rendition of the verdict four jurors told the court the verdict did not represent their true convictions, that they were led to believe they could not return a \u201ccompromise verdict\u201d and wanted the court to call the jury back to reconsider the verdict; (2) W. C. Engle, a juror, failed to reveal to the court that, in a lawsuit pending on the same trial list, he was represented by Mr. Patrono, one of Miss Wolfe\u2019s counsel and the failure of both the juror and the attorney to reveal such fact to the court was improper and a breach of their duties to the court. At that time no other reason was assigned.\nThe first reason upon which the court relied is without merit. In Friedman v. Ralph Brothers, Inc., 314 Pa. 247, 249, 171 A. 900, we said: \u201c. . . we cannot accept the statement of jurors as to what transpired in the jury room as to the propriety or impropriety of a juror\u2019s conduct ... To do so, would destroy the security of all verdicts and go far toward weakening the efficacy of trial by jury . . . Jurors cannot impeach their own verdict.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). See also: Commonwealth v. Johnson, 359 Pa. 287, 59 A. 2d 128; Commonwealth v. Newcomer, 183 Pa. Superior Ct. 432, 132 A. 2d 731.\nIn Havranek v. Pittsburgh, 344 Pa. 375, 25 A. 2d 703, where four jurors, after rendition of a verdict, expressed their dissatisfaction therewith, this court did not sanction the award of a new trial on that ground. Jurors must not be permitted to impeach their own verdict. In this connection it may be noted that the better practice would have been for the trial court to have talked with the jurors only in the presence of counsel.\nThe second reason assigned for the award of the new trial was the failure of the juror Engle to reveal to the court \u2014 not to opposing counsel \u2014 Ms representation by Dr. Biggie\u2019s counsel in another lawsuit. Wherein failure to reveal this fact to the court constitutes improper conduct is not clear: concealment of such fact from opposing counsel, of course, would be improper. In evaluating this reason, certain factual background must be considered. On the trial at the same term of court there was listed a trespass action of one Emil Sposato v. W. C. Engle (the juror) et al. In that action both Mr. Porter and Mr. Patrono represented Engle: thus, when Engle was selected, each counsel had full knowledge of the dual representation of Engle. Moreover, after the completion of the voir dire of the jurors and prior to the exercise of any peremptory challenges, Mr. Porter and Mr. Patrono conferred and agreed that, perhaps, it would be better if Engle did not serve as a juror and asked the court, through a message to the court crier, to have Engle excused as a possible juror: word was relayed to counsel, through the court crier, that, if either counsel desired, a peremptory challenge could be exercised and that the court did not deem it advisable to excuse Engle for cause.\nAbout a week after the trial had commenced and three days before rendition of the jury verdict, at a conference of counsel and the trial judge, the latter was directly informed that both Mr. Porter and Mr. Patrono represented Engle in the lawsuit pending on the current trial list. On being so informed, the court then stated that, had he known that fact, he would have excused Engle for cause, but that he \u201cknows Mr. Engle and knows he would follow the instructions of the Court. . .\u201d. A suggestion then made that Engle be excused and the trial proceed with eleven jurors was rejected by Dr. Biggie\u2019s counsel.\nThe record clearly shows knowledge of Mr. Patrono\u2019s representation of Engle by Mr. Porter, and vice versa: that, during the trial, the court was directly informed of the fact and did nothing about it: that there is not a scintilla of evidence that such fact had anything to do with the verdict rendered. This reason assigned by the court in its award of a new trial is completely without merit.\nNot only was the award of a new trial for the assigned two reasons capricious and arbitrary but the manner in which the new trial was granted was highly improper. A court may, sua sponte, award a new trial: Stephenson v. Service Supply Corp., 164 Pa. Superior Ct. 31, 63 A. 2d 438; Jedwabny v. Philadelphia Trans. Co., 390 Pa. 231, 135 A. 2d 252; Fisher v. Dye, 386 Pa. 141, 125 A. 2d 472; Commonwealth v. Fox, 181 Pa. Superior Ct. 292, 124 A. 2d 628. Such a rule, however, does not sanction the award of a new trial in the manner in which the court below acted in the case at bar.\nWithin hours of the rendition of the verdict, the court interrogated four jurors without notice to counsel: the court then interrogated the juror Engle, with a stenographer present but again without notice to counsel: then, without any knowledge on counsels\u2019 part and without any motion for a new trial, the court granted a new trial solely on the conduct of the jurors. Such practice cannot be countenanced: it constitutes a basic misconception of the role a judge occupies in our judicial system. The language in Albert J. Hoppe, Inc. v. St. Louis Public Service Co., 361 Mo. 402, 406, 235 S.W. 2d 347, is appropriate: \u201cThe question instantly before us goes deeply into the underlying principles of due process. In our system of jurisprudence reasonable notice to a litigant (when there exists even the possibility of action adverse to his interests) is deemed to be of the essence of fairness and justice. Reasonable notice to parties whose interests are at stake in a contemplated order is a prerequisite to the lawful exercise of the court's power. Opportunity for a litigant to present his views as to the matters instantly before the court which may affect his rights is the very foundation stone of our procedure. The requirement of notice can result in no hardship. Nor is it restrictive of the trial court\u2019s freedom of action in the exercise of its judicial discretion.\u201d\nAfter the award of the new trial (December 1, 1961), an appeal was taken to this Court (December 5,1961). Counsel for Dr. Riggle filed and served (December 16, 1961) a statement of the question to be raised on appeal, under Rule 22 of this Court, and of the evidence he did not intend to print, under Rule 40 of this Court. The question raised was whether the court below abused its discretion in awarding a new trial \u201cfor the reasons set forth in its order of December 1,1961.\" Miss Wolfe\u2019s counsel desired that other evidence be printed and, for that purpose, went before Judge Weiner. On December 18, 1961, Judge Weiner directed the enlargement of the printed record by such other evidence. Therefore, it is clear that on that date Judge Weiner knew the question raised on appeal and that the record to be presented to this Court would consist only of evidence relating to the conduct of the jurors.\nSix weeks after the award of a new trial, the trial judge filed an opinion entitled \u201cOpinion of Trial Judge in Support of Order Granting a New Trial\u201d. In that opinion the trial judge states that he \u201chad already been of the opinion that the verdict returned in favor of [Dr. Biggie] was so contrary to the evidence as to shock his sense of justice\u201d. The trial judge then proceeded to assign this as an additional reason to bolster the award of a new trial, even though no opportunity was afforded to Dr. Biggie\u2019s counsel to be heard in the matter and even though the award of a new trial was specifically based on the jurors\u2019 conduct.\nIn Clewell v. Plummer, 388 Pa. 592, 598, this Court, speaking through Justice (now Chief Justice) Bell, quoted with approval from Coward v. Ruckert, 381 Pa. 388, 393, 113 A. 2d 287: \u201c \u2018One of the least assailable grounds for the exercise of such power [to grant a new trial] is the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that the interests of justice therefore require that a new trial be awarded; especially in such a case is an appellate court reluctant to interfere\u2019 \u201d. The essential soundness of that rule is beyond question. However, the posture of the instant record completely relieves us of any reluctance to interfere in the case at bar.\nOn the present record there is nothing before us upon which we can determine whether the court below abused its discretion in deciding the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. There is nothing on this record concerning the negligence or lack of negligence and the fault for the absence of such evidence lies not with counsel for either party.\nThis appeal was taken from an order based on two, and only two, grounds. It was the grant of a new trial on those grounds which was challenged and the only evidence necessary to be printed was such as bore a relationship to those grounds. The court below, as well as counsel, was aware of that.\nThe opinion of January 17, 1962, is obviously a belated attempt to justify an award of a new trial untenable both in law and in the manner in which it was made. The case at bar does not present a situation portunity to be heard, belatedly assigns a new and ad-where the award of a new trial was based on a wrong ground whereas a proper ground existed. On the contrary, this is a situation where the reasons assigned for the award of a new trial are entirely without merit and the court below, without giving the parties an opditional reason the propriety of which cannot be determined on this diminuted record.\nThe grant ex parte of a new trial and the belated attempt to support such grant by a new and additional reason, after the grant of the new trial and the appeal therefrom, have deprived Dr. Biggie of the due process to which he is clearly entitled.\nIn reversing the order granting a new trial, we must do so in such manner as to preserve Miss Wolfe\u2019s rights. Were we to enter judgment on this verdict Miss Wolfe would be deprived of her right to file a motion for a new trial because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence or for some other valid reason. To Miss Wolfe must be given the right to file a motion for a new trial, and, if such motion be filed, both parties must be given an opportunity to a fair and impartial hearing on such motion. To that end, upon the return of the record to the court below, the right should be granted nunc pro tunc to Miss Wolfe to file a motion for a new trial within four days of the receipt of the record in the court below.\nOrder reversed. The record is remanded to the court below and the court below directed to proceed in a manner consistent with this opinion.\nMiss Wolfe alleged that Dr. Riggle performed an appendectomy upon her and, in the performance thereof, improperly administered a spinal anesthesia and, post-operatively, neglected to treat and advise her properly. As a result of such conduct, it was alleged that Miss Wolfe suffered a \u201cfoot drop\u201d and other serious, disabling injuries.\nThe verdict was returned on November 30, 1961 at about 7:45 p.m. The order is dated December 1, 1961. In exceptions to this order, it is averred that the \u201corder was made . . . within <m hour after the verdict . . . was received . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied)\nCarson, P. J., and Cummins, J., concurred therein.\nActually both Messrs. Porter and Patrono represented the same insurance company: Mr. Patrono represented Engle as a defendant and Mr. Porter represented Engle as a counterclaimant as well as Engle\u2019s son.\nApparently, under the practice in Washington County, voir dire of jurors is conducted by the court crier and the trial judge. On the voir dire of the court crier, Engle stated he knew both Messrs. Porter and Patrono. On the voir dire of the court, the court did not inquire of Bngle whether Messrs. Porter and Patrono, or either of them, had ever represented him.\nEmphasis supplied.\nThe voir dire examination of several jurors beside Engle and a record of a conference between counsel and the court on December 12, 1961.\nFive days prior to this opinion, President Judge Carson filed an opinion concurring in the order of December 1, 1961. His .concurrence is on two grounds: that Engle concealed from the court his relationship to Mr. Patrono and the fact he Knew Dr. Higgles. In this concurrence it is significant the grant of a new trial is not based on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of the evidence.\nWhether the time for filing a motion for a new trial can be extended, see: Lance v. Bonnell, 105 Pa. 46; Fisher v. Hestonville, Mantua & Fairmount Passenger Railway Company, 185 Pa. 602, 40 A. 97. Philadelphia Sub. Transportation Co. v. DiFrancesco, 362 Pa. 326, 66 A. 2d 254, is clearly distinguishable from the instant factual situation."}
