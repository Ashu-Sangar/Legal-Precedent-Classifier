{"id": "1831213", "contents": "OPINION OP THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nAppellant Jesse Eskridge was convicted of homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence and related charges, and was sentenced to prison for a term of three to seven years. Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. 387 Pa.Super. 647, 559 A.2d 961. The issue is whether a district attorney whose private law partners represented the victims of the accident in civil suits against the defendant had a clearly impermissible conflict of interest prohibiting him from prosecuting the defendant criminally. We hold that the conflict of interest should have precluded the district attorney from prosecuting appellant, and reverse the judgment of sentence.\nThe criminal charges arose out of a single vehicle accident which occurred while appellant was transporting three passengers: Carole Miller, who was killed in the accident, Karen Brown, and Riley Hines. Carole Miller\u2019s personal representative and Riley Hines engaged the law firm of Duplaga, Tocci, Palmieri, McMillen & Urick to represent them in civil suits against appellant. Beaver County District Attorney Edward J. Tocci is a member of the firm as are Palmieri and McMillen, who are assistant district attorneys under Tocci. Palmieri and McMillen filed negligence actions against appellant while the criminal prosecution was pending in the district attorney\u2019s office. District Attorney Tocci did not handle the prosecution personally, but delegated it to his assistant Dale Pouse; nevertheless, Pouse remained subject to the district attorney\u2019s guidance, control, and supervision.\nClearly, the successful criminal prosecution of appellant would have facilitated the prosecution of the civil actions. It is therefore apparent that the district attorney, Edward J. Tocci, had a direct financial interest in obtaining a conviction in appellant\u2019s case.\nThe conflict is due to the distinct role of a criminal prosecutor, who, unlike a private attorney, must exercise independent judgment in prosecuting a case and \u201chas the responsibility of a minister of justice and not simply that of an advocate.\u201d Rule of Professional Conduct 3.8, Comment. While a private attorney must \u201cact with commitment and dedication to the interests of the client and with zeal in advocacy upon the client\u2019s behalf,\u201d Rule of Professional Conduct 1.3, Comment, a prosecutor must abandon the prosecution if, in his professional judgment, justice will be promoted by doing so.\nThe evil inherent in this situation is precisely that which Judge Hoffman described as follows:\nThe situation is too ripe, however, with potential abuse: an attorney would be hard-pressed to abandon prosecution of a defendant when a criminal conviction would be proof of the alleged tort in the civil suit; the attorney would be free to use public resources to rout out additional evidence against the criminal defendant, a pursuit based not necessarily on the prosecutor\u2019s view of the social importance of the case, but solely on the private interest which he and his client have in the case. A defendant does not have a right not to be prosecuted; he does, however, have a right to have his case reviewed by an administrator of justice with his mind on the public purpose, not by an advocate whose judgment may be blurred by subjective reasons.\nCommonwealth v. Dunlap, 233 Pa.Super. 38, 46, 335 A.2d 364, 368 (1975) (Hoffman, J. dissenting) (emphasis added). The order of the Superior Court in Dunlap was affirmed by an equally divided Supreme Court. In the opinion in support of reversal, the late Mr. Justice Roberts wrote:\nA district attorney\u2019s professional responsibility is to seek justice \u2014 to protect the innocent as well as to convict the guilty. A private attorney, however, has an obligation to zealously represent his client and to seek to resolve all questions in favor of his client. Because the professional responsibilities of a district attorney and a private attorney differ, anytime a district attorney represents the victim in a civil suit at the same time that he is prosecuting the defendant, a conflict of interest exists.\nCommonwealth v. Dunlap, 474 Pa. 155, 158-59, 377 A.2d 975, 976 (1977) (Roberts, J., opinion in support of reversal). In addition, any prejudice suffered by a defendant due to such a conflict would not normally be susceptible to proof.\nEveryone involved in the criminal proceedings perceived the conflict. When the issue of the conflict of interest was raised in the trial court, the district attorney\u2019s office fully agreed with appellant\u2019s defense counsel that the problem was real. The trial judge stated on the record that he had spoken to District Attorney Tocci by telephone and that \u201cMr. Tocci recognizes that there is a problem with respect to his private law firm representing the witness in a civil litigation and has no desire to become involved in a dispute with respect to whether or not his office should be prosecuting this case and has indicated a willingness to recuse and request the Attorney General to undertake the prosecution.\u201d (T.T. at 8.) The actual prosecutor, Mr. Fouse, stated that \u201cmy concern, frankly, is the fact that Rule 1100 is something that needs to be taken into account. We agree that the Attorney General\u2019s office should be asked to come in.\u201d (T.T. at 9.) This court agrees that the ethical conflict is quite clear.\nAssistant District Attorney Fouse\u2019s only opposition to the defense motion was his tautological observation that \u201cRule 1100 is something that needs to be taken into account.\u201d (T.T. at 9.) Rule 1100 is something that needs to be taken into account in every criminal case. The testimony did not indicate that there was a speedy trial problem. If there was, it was a problem created by the district attorney\u2019s office; there is no difficulty in referring a case to the state attorney general\u2019s office for prosecution. 71 P.S. \u00a7 732-205(a)(3).\nBefore appellant\u2019s trial, he was given a choice: he could have a speedy trial or an impartial prosecutor, but not both. He was, with cryptic generosity, permitted to choose which right to waive: he could abandon his constitutional right to a speedy trial or his constitutional right to an impartial prosecutor. Faced with this Hobson\u2019s choice, his defense counsel stated, \u201cI can\u2019t in good conscience agree to any waiver of his rights [under the 180-day rule].\u201d (T.T. at 10.) As a result, appellant abandoned his right to an impartial prosecutor, and was prosecuted by a district attorney who had a direct financial interest in obtaining a criminal conviction.\nWe hold that a prosecution is barred when an actual conflict of interest affecting the prosecutor exists in the case; under such circumstances a defendant need not prove actual prejudice in order to require that the conflict be removed. The order of the Superior Court must be reversed and the judgment of sentence vacated.\nOrder reversed; judgment of sentence vacated; case remanded for new trial.\nCAPPY, J., joins this opinion and files a concurring opinion.\nZAPPALA, J., concurs in the result.\nNIX, C.J., files a dissenting opinion which is joined by PAPADAKOS, J."}
