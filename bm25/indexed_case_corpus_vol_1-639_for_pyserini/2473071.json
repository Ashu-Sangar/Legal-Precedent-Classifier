{"id": "2473071", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nAppellant Lori Foster was injured when she was forced to jump out of the way of an unidentified vehicle while working as a flagger on the highway. Foster filed a claim for uninsured motorist benefits under an automobile insurance policy issued by appellee State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company. She faxed State Farm a copy of the report form she received from her employer, but she never reported the accident to the police. State Farm filed a declaratory judgment action alleging Foster was not entitled to uninsured benefits because she had failed to report the accident to the police or other governmental authority, as required by both the insurance policy and the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (MVFRL) 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1701-1799.7. The policy provides, in pertinent part:\n4. Other Duties Under Medical Payments, Funeral Benefits, Loss of Income, Death, Dismemberment and Loss of Sight, Uninsured Motor Vehicle and Underinsured Motor Vehicle Coverages\nThe person making the claim also shall:\n* * *\nc. under the uninsured motor vehicle coverage, report an accident caused by an unidentified land motor vehicle to the police as soon as practicable and to us within 30 days or as soon as practicable.\nState Farm Policy, at 7 (emphasis added).\nThe MVFRL definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d includes:\n* * *\n(3) An unidentified motor vehicle that causes an accident resulting in injury provided the accident is reported to the police or proper governmental authority and the claimant notifies his insurer within 30 days, or as soon as practicable thereafter, that the claimant or his legal representative has a legal action arising out of the accident.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1702 (emphasis added).\nFoster argued that absent a showing of prejudice, State Farm could not deny coverage on this basis, particularly when it had not alleged prejudice. The trial court concluded sua sponte that State Farm had been prejudiced by Foster\u2019s failure to notify police, and entered judgment in favor of State Farm.\nFoster appealed to the Superior Court, arguing that under Brakeman v. Potomac Insurance Company, 472 Pa. 66, 371 A.2d 193 (1977), State Farm was required to demonstrate prejudice arising from the failure to notify police. Brakeman addressed the enforceability of an insurance policy\u2019s provision which required the insured to provide written notice of an accident to the insurer \u201cas soon as practicable\u201d after the accident. This Court held \u201cwhere an insurance company seeks to be relieved of its obligations under a liability insurance policy on the ground of late notice, the insurance company will be required to prove that the notice provision was in fact breached and that the breach resulted in prejudice to its position.\u201d Id., at 198. The rationale underlying this holding was that since such notice provisions are generally \u201cdictated by the insurance company to the insured\u201d to protect the insurer\u2019s interests, id., at 196, enforcement of these provisions, absent prejudice to the insurer, would result in an inequitable forfeiture, allowing the insurer to refuse the coverage for which the insured paid. Id., at 196-97. Therefore, if the insurer was not harmed by the lack of notice, the reason behind the notice provision \u2014 protection of the insurer\u2019s interests \u2014 was no longer a concern, and enforcement of the provision to deny coverage was neither logical nor fair. Id., at 197.\nThe Superior Court, by unpublished decision, rejected Foster\u2019s argument that Brakeman was controlling, and the court did not reach the issue of the trial court\u2019s sua sponte determination that prejudice existed. The Superior Court affirmed the order entering declaratory judgment in favor of State Farm. We granted allowance of appeal to determine whether an insurer must demonstrate prejudice, pursuant to Brakeman, when the insured has failed to report the accident to the police as required by \u00a7 1702 of the MVFRL.\n\u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). \u201cWhere the words of a statute are clear and free from ambiguity the legislative intent is to be gleaned from those very words.\u201d Pennsylvania Financial Responsibility Assigned Claims Plan v. English, 541 Pa. 424, 664 A.2d 84, 87 (1995). In ascertaining the intent of the General Assembly, it is presumed \u201cthe General Assembly intends to favor the public interest as against any private interest.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(5); see English, at 87. The legislative concern for the increasing cost of automobile insurance is the public policy to be advanced by statutory interpretation of the MVFRL. See Burstein v. Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company, 570 Pa. 177, 809 A.2d 204, 207-08 (2002).\nFoster argues the Superior Court\u2019s decision, in effect, overruled Brakeman by holding it was no longer applicable due to the enactment of the MVFRL, and claims the court erred in holding an insured\u2019s failure to notify the police about an accident was per se prejudicial to an insurer. She contends Brakeman should have been applied to her case.\nContrary to Foster\u2019s assertion, the Superior Court neither overruled Brakeman nor held that failure to report an accident is per se prejudicial to the insurer; rather, the court held Brakeman did not apply, and therefore State Farm was not required to show prejudice. See State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Foster, No. 1200 MDA 2002, unpublished memorandum at 8-9, 2004 WL 885833 (Pa.Super. filed January 22, 2004) (finding Brakeman \u201cnot controlling under the facts\u201d and \u201cnot applicable here\u201d).\nThe MVFRL had not been enacted when Brakeman was decided. The legislative concern behind enactment of the MVFRL was \u201cthe spiraling consumer cost of automobile insurance and the resultant increase in the number of uninsured motorists driving on public highways.\u201d Burstein, at 207 (citing Paylor v. Hartford, Insurance Co., 536 Pa. 583, 640 A.2d 1234, 1234 (1994)). Section 1702\u2019s police notification requirement advances the policy of keeping automobile insurance affordable to the public by minimizing fraudulent claims \u201cand the attempted recovery of benefits in cases where accidents were alleged to have been caused by \u2018phantom\u2019 vehicles.\u201d Jackson v. Pennsylvania Financial Responsibility Assigned Claims Plan, 394 Pa.Super. 274, 575 A.2d 626, 628 n. 2 (1990); see also Blazquez v. Pennsylvania Financial Responsibility Assigned Claims Plan, 757 A.2d 384 (Pa.Super.2000) (purpose of \u00a7 1702\u2019s reporting requirement is prevention of fraudulent claims; Department of Transportation not \u201cproper governmental authority\u201d within meaning of \u00a7 1702); Owens v. The Travelers Insurance Co., 450 Pa.Super. 242, 675 A.2d 751 (1996) (purpose of \u00a7 1702\u2019s reporting requirement is to prevent fraud; employer and Department of Labor and Industry not \u201cproper governmental authority\u201d within meaning of \u00a7 1702). The cost to the insurer of paying fraudulent claims is ultimately passed on to the public in the form of higher premiums. That is, the purpose behind \u00a7 1702\u2019s reporting requirement is protection of the public\u2019s interest in affordable automobile insurance \u2014 the primary goal of the MVFRL.\nIn contrast, the purpose of the notification requirement in Brakeman was protection of the insurer\u2019s private interest. The requirement was not imposed by a statutory scheme to further a public policy interest, but was drafted by the insurer to protect its own interest in being able to conduct timely investigations of claims. See Brakeman, at 197. The notice provision in Brakeman required the insured to report the accident to the insurer, whereas \u00a7 1702 requires reporting to the police or other proper governmental authority, agents independent from the insurer itself. Based on the differing purposes behind the notification provisions in Brakeman and \u00a7 1702, we agree with the Superior Court that Brakeman\u2019s prejudice requirement is inapplicable to the notice provision of \u00a7 1702.\nFoster argues, however, that the intent behind the MVFRL should not apply to an insurance contract; an insurance contract is essentially a contract of adhesion, and the MVFRL is not concerned with forfeiture of the insured\u2019s policy. Foster claims that because the State Farm policy places the notification requirement in its section pertaining to duties of the insured, whereas the MVFRL includes the reporting requirement in its definition of \u201cuninsured vehicle,\u201d the intent behind the MVFRL does not apply to the policy\u2019s provisions.\nFoster\u2019s attempt to distinguish between the two notification provisions fails. She overlooks the fact that, unlike Brakeman, which only required the insurer be notified, the instant policy requires police notification, just as the MVFRL does. Regardless of where the requirement is located within the policy, it is required under the MVFRL and is consistent with the MVFRL\u2019s purpose of preventing fraudulent claims by requiring that accidents be reported to the police. Furthermore, to the extent there is any conflict between the policy and the MVFRL: \u201c \u2018stipulations in a contract of insurance in conflict with, or repugnant to, statutory provisions which are applicable to, and consequently form a part of, the contract, must yield to the statute, and are invalid, since contracts cannot change existing statutory laws.\u2019 \u201d Prudential Properly and Casualty Insurance Company v. Colbert, 572 Pa. 82, 813 A.2d 747, 751 (2002) (quoting Allwein v. Donegal Mutual Insurance Company, 448 Pa.Super. 364, 671 A.2d 744, 752 (1996) (quoting Couch on Insurance 2d (Rev. ed.) \u00a7 13.7 at 827 (1984))).\nFinally, Foster contends the purpose of the police reporting requirement was fulfilled since she reported the accident to her doctors, employer, and State Farm. However, \u00a7 1702\u2019s language does not refer to an insured\u2019s employer as an authority to be notified, and it requires reporting to the insurer in addition to, not instead of, notifying the police. As the Superior Court held in Owens and Blazquez, \u00a7 1702\u2019s fraud prevention is not achieved by reporting to employers or other agencies which do not investigate accidents, care for accident victims, or ensure highway safety; the police are charged with reporting and investigating accidents and are \u201cin a unique position to prevent fraud.... \u201d Owens, at 753; see also Blazquez, at 387 (\u201c[G]overnmental agencies which are proper repositories for reporting under the MVFRL are those that care for victims of accidents such as governmental fire and rescue squads, those agencies which investigate accidents such as law enforcement, and those agencies charged with the safety of the roads and highways, such as PennDOT.\u201d (citation omitted)).\nThus, the MVFRL\u2019s provision is controlling, and neither its plain language, the case law interpreting it, nor its underlying policy require that prejudice must be established before uninsured coverage can be denied based on lack of police notification. The Superior Court did not err in concluding that Brakeman was inapplicable, and the denial of uninsured coverage to Foster was proper.\nOrder affirmed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justice NEWMAN join the opinion.\nJustice NIGRO did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\nJustice BAER files a dissenting opinion in which Justice CASTILLE joins.\n. Foster further contended the trial court erred in concluding State Farm was prejudiced, and in raising the issue sua sponte.\n. As the Superior Court\u2019s decision in the instant case was unpublished, it is not of precedential value. See Superior Court I.O.P. 65.37 (unpublished memorandum decision shall not be relied upon or cited by Court or party). Non-precedential decisions cannot overrule existing case law.\n. Foster argues these cases are inapplicable because they involve the Assigned Claims Plan, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1751-1757, where the funding for insurance does not come from premiums paid by the insured but instead from the insurer. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 16-17. However, the MVFRL's reporting requirement does not differentiate between claims made under the Assigned Claims Plan and claims made under insurance contracts."}
