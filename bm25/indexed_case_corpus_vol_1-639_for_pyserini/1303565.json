{"id": "1303565", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Musmanno,\nOn June 17, 1957, Clement P. Layman, the plaintiff in this case, was seriously injured when the bus in which he was riding was struck in the rear by another bus. In the ensuing trespass action which he brought against the Doernte Bus Lines, owner of both buses, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $25,000. The defendant seeks a new trial on the sole asserted ground that the verdict is excessive and should not be allowed to stand.\nWhen bus No. 1, in which the plaintiff was a passenger, was struck by bus No. 2, the plaintiff was thrown with great force against the back of the seat which he occupied, his head coming into violent contact with the handrail above the seat. This whiplash blow fractured the plaintiff\u2019s sixth and seventh vertebrae and, in consequence, he sustained disabilities and incurred ailments from which he had not recovered up to the time of the trial in October, 1960.\nImmediately after the accident the plaintiff was treated by a chiropractor who later recommended him to Dr. Frank Pantalone, an orthopedic surgeon and physician.. Dr. Pantalone, who examined Clement Layman on July 20, 1957, testified: \u201c. . . my first examination showed that he couldn\u2019t turn his neck well from one side to the other or forward or backwards. Whenever I pressed in back of his neck, he would have a lot of pain and tenderness. The muscles in the back of his neck would be as hard as rocks. There would be expansion and rigidity. He had spasms in the region of his neck . . . When I would press on his neck, it would shoot the pain through his neck and between the shoulder blades. He had weakness of both of his shoulder regions and his arms. The pain went all the way down to the bottom of his chest in the back.\u201d\nThe doctor found that the plaintiff had \u201ctwo definite fractures or broken bones in two of the spinal processes.\u201d He recommended physiotherapy, a cervical collar, a cervical pillow, a brace for his back, muscle stimu-' lation and home traction.\nThe plaintiff testified that he suffered from constant headaches. He described the symptoms: \u201cYou would swear your head was going to bust.\u201d He said further that his head \u201cgets full of knots.\u201d When his wife was asked as to Layman\u2019s sleeping habits after the accident she replied: \u201cTwisting and turning and groaning.\u201d\nThe doctor testified the plaintiff received physiotherapy 144 times; he saw him at his office about 175 times. Even after three years of medication and treatment, the plaintiff\u2019s prognosis was not a bright one: \u201c. .. I am of the opinion after having examined him and followed him not once or twice but for three (3) years, I am convinced in my opinion he will never get completely better. He will maintain the disability that he now has for the rest of his life. The x-rays show instead of getting better as a result of the accident they have gotten worse. I am definitely convinced he will maintain the permanent partial disability that he now has.\u201d\nThe plaintiff\u2019s wife testified that her husband \u201cseems to be getting what you call weaker.\u201d Also that \u201chis condition is becoming progressively worse.\u201d\nDr. Pantalone said that the two fractures \u201chave not hooked together\u201d: \u201cthe two pieces that are broken off the two vertebrae are still there in the muscles of the neck. If he doesn\u2019t get any better and tends to get worse, they will have to be removed because they are just like something there that doesn\u2019t belong there . . . He has a lot of muscle turned into gristle ... No. 6 and No. 7 are split right in the middle . . . These can\u2019t heal because they are in the part of the neck where there is always motion going on no matter how much you try to stop it.\u201d\nThe doctor recommended an operation to \u201ctake out these two pieces\u201d but he was not certain that the operation would accomplish a permanent cure because the plaintiff would still need physiotherapy.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s total out-of-pocket expenses up to the date of the trial amounted to some $2100. If the operation is performed the surgical bill will amount to $500, plus hospital bills, and then there will be the further expense for the therapy treatments.\nThe appellant\u2019s brief states: \u201cAccepting these figures, it therefore seems that the jury awarded the plaintiff somewhere between $20,000 and $22,000 for his pain and suffering,\u201d and that this amount shocks \u201ca sense of justice.\u201d The appellant\u2019s principal argument in support of the asserted excessiveness of the verdict rests on the fact that the plaintiff lost no time from his occupation because of his injuries.\nIt is true that the plaintiff did not remain away from his job the day after the accident and that he continued to be gainfully employed when work was available, but this, ipso facto, is not proof that he was not physically disabled. There are many reasons why a person would continue at liis employment and still be suffering from the effects of severe trauma.\nThe plaintiff, at the time of the accident, was 51 years of age. He is married and has four children, two of whom (a son 23 years of age and another 16) live with him at home. The 23-year old son is a permanent cripple, whose total helplessness is reflected in the fact that he must be spoon-fed. The younger son attends school. When the plaintiff was asked why he went to work after the accident he replied: \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t keep the family going not working.\u201d\nOne who has been injured as the result of a tortious deed, and is legally entitled to recovery for his injuries, should not be penalized because he works in pain, and toils in agony, in order not to suffer the greater torment of seeing his family in want.\nMoreover, continued employment after an accident, is no infallible criterion of physical strength, stamina or wholeness. Prior to the bus accident the plaintiff was employed as a \u201cshot blaster\u201d at the National Tube Company. The appellant describes this job as one entailing \u201cthe moving of large pipes, the rolling of them, the handling of a hose and distributing small steel pellets onto these pipes under heavy pressure. Following this, this shot must be shoveled up and these shovelfuls weigh approximately 75 pounds.\u201d\nThe appellant argues that since this type of job obviously requires physical strength and muscular power, the plaintiff could not possibly have been as seriously disabled as he testified. But the appellant ignores the all-important fact that the plaintiff did not return to his shot blasting job. His foreman, being aware of his injuries, put him to work \u201cpushing a broom or working on kneeling couplings or odd jobs like that.\u201d A benevolent employer may make allowances for a faithful employee and assign him to comparatively easy jobs so that the pay envelopes may, like an unbroken assembly line, continue to carry the necessities of life to the employee\u2019s family. Thus, if Layman received the same rate of wages after the accident as before, this was due to the generous attitude of the employer, which benevolence does not lessen the responsibility of the tortfeasor. One who is responsible for an accident is required to make the victim of that accident whole to the extent that money can accomplish this, regardless of the intervening philanthropy of third persons.\nTwenty thousand dollars is not an excessive sum for the pain, suffering and inconvenience which the plaintiff has endured and to which he will continue to be subjected as the result of his injuries. Because of those injuries he had to wear a cervical collar, one of those devices which gives to the wearer the rigidity and the possible appearance of a tribal chieftain wearing numerous iron necklaces. Aside from the pain and discomfort of such a contrivance, the wearer experiences the humiliating sensation of being in a pillory; he walks about in a mobile stock. There is the suggestion of a medieval felon.\nLayman wore this apparatus, which he called a \u201cdog collar\u201d, for a year \u2014 night and day, removing it only when he had to wash it because \u201cThe heat of your body would cause sweat, and it would run down the front of your shirt.\u201d\nEven three years after the accident he still had to adopt the collar on occasion because, he said: \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have the support, you sit down and your head just seems to want to fall down.\u201d\nThe plaintiff must also continue to use the \u201chome traction,\u201d a device of pulleys, ropes, weights and chin cup described by the doctor as a contrivance which \u201cgoes and stops, goes and stops.\u201d The plaintiff is required to wear his brace every day; at night he must use the \u201ccervical pillow\u201d, and he sleeps with a board beneath his mattress. When the weather changes, he experiences excruciating pains in the head and neck.\nThe phrase \u201cpain and suffering\u201d has become a commonplace in the law and often is employed in a casual manner to suggest the temporary discomfort which accompanies a temporary disability. In this case, however, the phrase takes on a meaning of true and literal significance. The plaintiff\u2019s pain is intense and constant, and his suffering is penetrating and severe. This type of hurt creates a disability of its own, which loses none of its compensatory scope because the sufferer, for reasons already stated, continues to be gainfully employed at the same wage paid him prior to his disablement.\nThe static nature of one\u2019s stipend may in this day of constantly increasing wages be evidence in itself of remunerational impairment.\nWithin the phrase \u201cpain and suffering\u201d falls also the loss sustained by the head of a household who, because of his physical incapacity, is unable to perform domestic tasks which theretofore contributed substantially to the well-being of the household. Prior to June, 1957, Layman habitually worked at his garden (%ths of an acre), the yield of which helped in the domestic economy, he did the repair work around the house, he assisted in the cleaning processes and generally performed all those jobs, whose completion go to make up a well-organized happy home. This type of activity has its monetary equivalent and the inability to perform it comes within the ambit of pain and suffering.\nLayman helped his wife to take care of their crippled child. Mrs. Layman testified: \u201cLike I said before, he always tried to help me with this boy of ours. We have to do everything for him, even feed him. He can\u2019t hold a spoon. I have to feed him by mouth. He [husband] can\u2019t help to do that anymore.\u201d\nIt is obvious that the inability to assist one\u2019s own helpless child is a grievous pain in itself.\nThe appellant has cited various cases in ivhich asserted high verdicts were reduced by this Court and the Superior Court. The mere height of a verdict, however, is in itself no evidence of excessiveness because height is always a matter of relativity. Even the Empire State Building in Netv York is but a toadstool when placed against the image of M[t. Everest. Thus, the $25,000 verdict in this case must be placed against the mountain peaks of inflation, as well as the hills of the years the plaintiff must climb before he reaches the climacteric of life. A verdict of $25,000 of today is certainly not equivalent to a verdict of that sum twenty years ago, much less is it like a similar verdict of thirty and forty years ago. (Spangler v. Helm\u2019s New York-Pittsburgh Motor Express, 396 Pa. 482.)\nNostalgic and sweet as may be the memory of the American dollar of 1940,1930, and 1920, the inexorable fact remains that that dollar has gone forever. It would require a search of sea-diving or archaeological intensity to find an article whose price has not doubled, tripled, or quadrupled during the last two or three decades. Hence, a comparison with verdicts of the past can only be meaningful if we assume in unrestrained fantasy that we can still purchase a five-cent ice cream cone, a five-cent hamburger, a five-cent shoe shine, a good five-cent cigar, a 35-eent haircut, a 15-cent shave, beef steak at 15 cents a pound, a good theatre seat for 50 cents, a seven-course dinner for a dollar, a pair of shoes for two dollars, and a 12-ounce glass of beer for a buffalo nickel, both buffalo and nickel having now, for practical purposes, almost disappeared.\nMoreover, the facts in the cases cited by the appellant are wholly dissimilar, to the ones in the case at bar. In addition it must be kept in mind that the plaintiff faces the prospect of an operation which will include hospitalization and forced abandonment of gainful employment during the period of surgery and convalescence, and then there are always the therapy treatments which the doctor has prescribed for the rest of the plaintiff\u2019s life.\nIn view of all these circumstances, the verdict of $25,000, instead of shocking the conscience of the court, convinces the Court that it is fair and reasonable and should be sustained.\nThe judgment is accordingly affirmed.\nThe original owner of .the buses was Harry W. Doernte, trading and doing business as Doernte Bus Lines. He died and the defendant in this lawsuit became Mary Jane Doernte, Administratrix of the Estate of Harry W. Doernte."}
