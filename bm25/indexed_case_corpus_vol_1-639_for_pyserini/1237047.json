{"id": "1237047", "contents": "Opinion\nPee Cubiam,\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed on the opinion of Judges Paeey and Mawhinney.\nIt was suggested-during the course of the argument that the degree of appellant\u2019s moral turpitude disclosed in the record of the disbarment proceedings did not justify his disbarment, but, at most, his suspension for a limited period of time. This suggestion would, more properly, be for the consideration of the court if an application for reinstatement be filed at some future time."}
