{"id": "864227", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nAll the questions presented by this record were fully considered and correctly disposed of in the court below, first by the learned auditing judge and afterwards by the court in banc. Nothing can be profitably added to what has been said by the former in the clear and concise opinion that has been sent up with the record. The decree is therefore affirmed on his opinion, and the appeal is dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant."}
