{"id": "1776311", "contents": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nThis case presents several issues: (1) whether appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were violated when police (armed with an arrest warrant) entered a third-party\u2019s apartment, arrested appellant, and seized his revolver; (2) whether appellant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were violated when the police failed to announce their purpose prior to breaking into the apartment; (3) whether appellant violated 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 907(a) (possessing instruments of crime) by openly carrying a loaded revolver; (4) whether, despite appellant\u2019s offer to stipulate that he committed a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d appellant\u2019s prior murder conviction was admissible to prove that he violated 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6105, which prohibits individuals convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d from possessing firearms; and (5) whether appellant could assert intolerable prison conditions as a defense to the crime of escape.\nOn October 1,1975, while incarcerated following a murder conviction for the shooting death of one Timothy Shinn, appellant escaped from the Philadelphia General Hospital Detention Unit. When police discovered appellant was gone, they broadcast an hourly \u201cwanted\u201d message over the police radio, informed the State Crime Information Center, and widely disseminated appellant\u2019s \u201cmug shot\u201d. An arrest warrant was issued the next day.\nWhile appellant was at large, Carmen Sperduto observed appellant with Jacqueline Keim. Ms. Keim told Mr. Sperduto that appellant was a fugitive and was staying at her apartment on West Roosevelt Boulevard in Philadelphia. (Appellant was heard to say that \u201che needed a place to hole up ... until things got cooled off.\u201d) Mr. Sperduto also observed appellant drop and retrieve a small caliber revolver. On October 3, after seeing appellant\u2019s picture in the paper, Mr. Sperduto called the police and stated that he \u201cmight know\u201d appellant\u2019s whereabouts.\nAbout an hour later, Mr. Sperduto conducted the police to Ms. Keim\u2019s apartment. The police called for reinforcements, but no search warrant was obtained. When reinforcements arrived, an officer knocked and announced \u201cPolice\u201d. Thirty to sixty seconds elapsed with no response. The police then forced open the door and proceeded through the living room and dining room. In a small back bedroom, the police observed what they first thought to be a bundle of clothing beneath a small portable crib. Upon closer examination, the police discerned the figure of a man (appellant) and apprehended the appellant. Simultaneously, the police seized a fully loaded revolver from the top of a small bureau next to the crib, within appellant\u2019s reach.\nAppellant\u2019s motion to suppress this revolver was denied, and the revolver was admitted into evidence at appellant\u2019s trial. A jury convicted appellant of escape offenses, possessing an instrument of crime, and possessing a prohibited offensive weapon. [18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 5721, 5722, 907(a), 908]. Appellant, however, was acquitted of possessing a firearm prohibited to an individual convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d [18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6105]. Appellant was sentenced to two and one-half to nine years imprisonment, the Superior Court affirmed, and we granted allocatur.\nFirst, appellant claims that the revolver should have been suppressed because the police entered Ms. Keim\u2019s apartment without a search warrant or probable cause to believe that appellant was inside the apartment. Appellant\u2019s claim simply misapprehends the situation. Appellant\u2019s revolver was taken from the bureau, an area in his immediate control, incident to a lawful arrest, a constitutionally permissible seizure. It is fundamental that areas within a suspect\u2019s immediate control may be searched incident to a lawful arrest to prevent danger to the arresting officers and to prevent destruction of evidence. See Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685 (1969), reh. den., 396 U.S. 869, 90 S.Ct. 36, 24 L.Ed.2d 124 (1969); Commonwealth v. Bess, 476 Pa. 364, 382 A.2d 1212 (1978). The revolver was the \u201cfruit\u201d of a lawful arrest, not the \u201cfruit\u201d of a search of the apartment. See United States v. Cravero, 545 F.2d 406 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. den., 429 U.S. 1100, 97 S.Ct. 1123, 51 L.Ed.2d 549 (1977); Commonwealth v. Wagner, 486 Pa. 548, 406 A.2d 1026 (1979) (concurring opinion by Nix, J.); Commonwealth v. Stanley, 265 Pa.Super. 194, 401 A.2d 1166 (1979); Commonwealth v. Terebieniec, 268 Pa.Super. 511, 525 n.4, 408 A.2d 1120, 1127 n.4 (1979). Probable cause to search the apartment or a warrant to search the apartment were wholly unnecessary.\nThere is yet another reason why appellant\u2019s claim fails. A valid arrest warrant and mere \u201creason to believe\u201d that appellant was within was all that the police needed to enter. More stringent requirements \u2014 a search warrant or probable cause \u2014 were wholly unnecessary. See Payton v. New York, 445 U.S. 573, 100 S.Ct. 1371, 63 L.Ed.2d 639 (1980) (police armed with an arrest warrant and \u201creason to believe\u201d that a suspect is within can enter a suspect\u2019s own home and seize evidence in plain view); Commonwealth v. Williams, 483 Pa. 293, 396 A.2d 1177 (1978), cert. den., 446 U.S. 912, 100 S.Ct. 1843, 64 L.Ed.2d 266 (1980). The police, relying on Mr. Sperduto\u2019s information, had \u201creason to believe\u201d that appellant was in Ms. Keim\u2019s apartment. The Payton v. New York and Commonwealth v. Williams cases, which apply to searches of a suspect\u2019s own home, also govern appellant\u2019s case. Fourth Amendment claims involve the accused\u2019s \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy\u201d in the areas searched. See Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978); Commonwealth v. Wagner, 486 Pa. 548, 406 A.2d 1026 (1979). If an arrest warrant and \u201creason to believe\u201d that a suspect can be found on the premises are sufficient for police to invade a suspect\u2019s own home, then these facts are sufficient to invade a third party\u2019s premises, where a suspect\u2019s expectation of privacy is necessarily less.\nSecond, appellant claims that the revolver should have been suppressed because the police failed to announce their purpose prior to entering. Generally, absent exigent circumstances, police must announce both their authority and purpose before forcible entry. Miller v. United States, 357 U.S. 301, 78 S.Ct. 1190, 2 L.Ed.2d 1332 (1958); Commonwealth v. Newman, 429 Pa. 441, 240 A.2d 795 (1968). In this case, the police knocked and announced \u201cPolice,\u201d but failed to announce their purpose before breaking in thirty to sixty seconds later. However, all Fourth Amendment requirements are tempered by considerations of reasonableness under the circumstances. Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963). The purpose of the \u201cknock and announce\u201d requirement is to permit peaceful surrender of the premises before forcible intrusion. Commonwealth v. DeMichel, 442 Pa. 553, 277 A.2d 159 (1971). After the police knocked and announced their identity, and there was absolutely no response for up to one minute, peaceful surrender of the premises could not reasonably have been anticipated, and communication of purpose was unnecessary.. Cf. Commonwealth v. Fladger, 263 Pa.Super. 538, 398 A.2d 707 (1979). The Fourth Amendment does not require that the police stand in a corridor talking to a door. The police need not engage in a \u201cfutile gesture\u201d when the occupants of the premises remain silent. See Commonwealth v. Samuels, 235 Pa.Super. 192, 340 A.2d 880 (1975), allocatur denied.\nFurthermore, it was unnecessary for the police to announce their purpose because of the exigent circumstances which were present, i.e., potential harm and peril to the safety of the police. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 223 Pa.Super. 83, 289 A.2d 733 (1972); Commonwealth v. Timko, 491 Pa. 32, 417 A.2d 620 (1980) (Larsen, J. dissenting opinion); United States v. Kane, 637 F.2d 974 (3d Cir. 1981). The Fourth Amendment cannot be interpreted to imperil law enforcement officers. Appellant, who was reported to be armed, had escaped from imprisonment for the crime of murder committed with a firearm. Under these circumstances, by announcing their identity and waiting at all, the police did more than was required by the Fourth Amendment. Rather than cowering beneath a crib, appellant may have been preparing an ambush. Consequently, to have delayed any further would have been risky and foolhardy on the part of the police. The revolver seized during appellant\u2019s arrest was properly admitted into evidence.\nThird, appellant contends that his possession of the loaded revolver did not violate 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 907 (Possessing Instruments of Crime). Appellant\u2019s contention is meritless. This Court must construe the words of a statute according to their plain meaning. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1903(a) (Statutory Construction Act of 1972); Commonwealth v. Mumma, 489 Pa. 547, 414 A.2d 1026 (1980). Appellant was convicted of violating Section 907 of the Crimes Code, which plainly provides:\n(a) Criminal instruments generally. \u2014 A person commits a misdemeanor of the first degree if he possesses any instrument of crime with intent to employ it criminally.\nAn \u201cInstrument of Crime\u201d is defined to include:\n[AJnything commonly used for criminal purposes and possessed by the actor under circumstances not manifestly appropriate for lawful uses it may have.\nAppellant possessed a loaded revolver when he was arrested for the crime of escape; appellant clearly possessed an \u201cinstrument of crime\u201d, under Section 907(a). See Commonwealth v. Davis, 491 Pa. 363, 421 A.2d 179 (1980), Commonwealth v. Harley, 275 Super.Ct. 407, 418 A.2d 1354 (Special Transfer Docket, 1980); Commonwealth v. McNear, 238 Pa.Super. 177, 353 A.2d 39 (1975), aff\u2019d mem., 478 Pa. 19, 385 A.2d 975 (1978).\nFourth, appellant contends that his prior murder conviction which resulted from the shooting death of Timothy Shinn was improperly and prejudicially admitted into evidence at trial to prove that he violated 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6105 which prohibits an individual convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d from possessing firearms. Appellant offered to stipulate that he committed a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d,, but the prosecutor refused to accept the stipulation. Instead, the prosecutor was permitted to call a prison-records custodian and an assistant district attorney who testified that appellant was convicted of first degree murder on May 28, 1975. Absolutely no reference was made to the facts underlying the 1975 conviction. Nevertheless appellant contends that in light of his offer to stipulate to a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d, actual mention of the murder conviction was unduly prejudicial. This contention is meritless.\nThe Pennsylvania Uniform Firearms Act, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6102 defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d to include:\nAny of the following crimes, or an attempt to commit any of the same, namely: murder, rape, aggravated assault, robbery, burglary, entering a building with intent to commit a crime therein, and kidnapping.\nHence, appellant\u2019s murder conviction was undisputedly material and relevant to proving that he committed a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d As such, it was \u201cproper\u201d evidence, squarely within Commonwealth v. Evans, 465 Pa. 12, 348 A.2d 92 (1975) which held that the Commonwealth may use any \u201cproper\u201d evidence to prove its case, and does not have to accept the accused\u2019s stipulations. See United States v. Williams, 612 F.2d 735 (3d Cir. 1979), cert. den., 445 U.S. 934, 100 S.Ct. 1328, 63 L.Ed.2d 770 (1980). Of interest, appellant was acquitted of this charge of violating Section 6105.\nFifth, appellant contends that the court should have permitted him to introduce into evidence alleged facts that prison conditions were intolerable, in order to establish a defense to escape and possessing instruments of escape. [18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 5121, 5122]. Specifically, appellant alleges that he suffered severe bodily and mental injury due to lack of medical care and overcrowding. We find appellant\u2019s contention to be meritless.\nThe \u201cescape\u201d section of the Crimes Code specifically forcloses certain defenses:\n\u00a7 5121. Escape ....\n(c) Effect of legal irregularity in detention. \u2014 Irregularity in bringing about or maintaining detention, or lack of jurisdiction of the committing or detaining authority, shall not be a defense to prosecution under this section.\nClaims of overcrowding and poor medical attention pertain to \u201cirregularity in . .. maintaining detention\u201d and the court below properly refused to entertain them. See Commonwealth v. Nardi, 185 Pa.Super. 136, 138 A.2d 140 (1958), allocatur denied (illegal detention of minor in wrong institution not a defense to escape). The policy behind this statute is sound: self-help remedies which jeopardize the safety of citizens of this Commonwealth, the safety of prison officials, and the orderly administration of prisons cannot be condoned. Moreover, the remedies of habeas corpus [Commonwealth el rel. Bryant v. Hendrick, 444 Pa. 83, 280 A.2d 110 (1971)] and civil rights actions under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 [Fox v. Sullivan, 539 F.2d 1065 (5th Cir. 1976)], are available to prisoners protesting prison conditions.\nAppellant, however, would have us construe the alleged intolerable prison conditions as a form of the \u201cduress\u201d defense, defined at 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 309:\n(a) General rule. \u2014 It is a defense that the actor engaged in the conduct charged to constitute an offense because he was coerced to do so by the use of, or a threat to use, unlawful force against his person or the person of another, which a person of reasonable firmness in his situation would have been unable to resist.\nWe reject appellant\u2019s contention, simply because the alleged overcrowding and poor medical care do not constitute \u201cforce against [appellant\u2019s] person\u201d. Other jurisdictions which have recognized escape defenses have done so in cases which involve immediate threats of serious bodily injury, death, or forcible sexual attack. See People v. Lovercamp, 43 Cal. App.3d 823, 118 Cal.Rptr. 110 (1974). None of those factors are present in this case.\nIf this Court were to recognize poor prison conditions as a defense to escape, a simple escape trial would turn into a sweeping trial of the prison system itself. Scarce judicial resources would be squandered to consider the testimony of an endless succession of disgruntled inmates. See United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980).\nAdditionally, a prerequisite to asserting the defense of intolerable prison conditions is voluntary return to custody as soon as the \u201cduress\u201d has ended. United States v. Bailey, supra; Commonwealth v. Clark, 287 Pa.Super. 13, 429 A.2d 695 (1981). The alleged \u201cduress\u201d of intolerable conditions ceased while appellant was at large, yet he failed to return to custody voluntarily. The trial court correctly refused to consider his \u201cintolerable conditions\u201d defense.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which FLAH-ERTY, J., joined.\nO\u2019BRIEN, C. J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Appellant also claims that the arrest warrant was invalid and that the Information in which he was charged with violating 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6105 had improperly been amended prior to trial. These claims were not raised in appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal, hence waived. Pa.R.A.P. 1115(a)(3); Commonwealth v. Drake, 489 Pa. 541, 414 A.2d 1023 (1980); Abramson v. Commonwealth, Public Utility Commission, 489 Pa. 267, 270 n.5, 414 A.2d 60, 62 n.5 (1980).\n. This conviction was subsequently (1979) reversed and a new trial was granted. See Commonwealth v. Stanley, 484 Pa. 2, 398 A.2d 631 (1979).\n. The Superior Court also concluded that since the purpose of the police entry into Ms. Keim\u2019s apartment was to effect appellant\u2019s arrest, not to search the apartment, appellant had no standing to object to the intrusion. Commonwealth v. Stanley, 265 Pa.Super. 194, 401 A.2d 1166 (1979).\n. Commonwealth v. Shaw, 476 Pa. 543, 383 A.2d 496 (1978), which held that absent exigent circumstances, police must have probable cause to enter a suspect\u2019s own home to effect a warrantless arrest, is inapplicable to this case. Appellant was the subject of a valid arrest warrant. Moreover, appellant mistakenly relies on Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204, 101 S.Ct. 1642, 68 L.Ed.2d 38 (1981), which determined that absent exigent circumstances, police need a search warrant to enter premises belonging to a third party, even though police had a valid warrant to arrest a suspect. The Steagald case involved the Fourth Amendment rights of the third party owner (whose cocaine was seized) and expressly did not adjudicate the rights of the suspect (who was not even found.) Id. at 219-220, 101 S.Ct. at 1651. At any rate, it would be anomalous to interpret Steagald v. United States to afford appellant more rights in Ms. Keim\u2019s apartment than he would have in his own home under Payton v. New York.\n. Arguing from legislative history, appellant maintains that part (a) and part (b) of Section 907 are mutually exclusive with regard to firearms: that Section 907(b) prohibits the possession of concealed weapons, expressly including firearms, and that Section 907(a) prohibits possession of all other instruments of crime, implicitly excluding firearms. Appellant concludes that his non-concealed, open possession of the revolver violated neither Section 907(a) or Section 907(b), hence was perfectly legal.\n. Appellant also contends that he should receive a new trial because reference was made to his 1975 murder conviction and that conviction was reversed and a new trial granted in 1979, which was subsequent to the within trial. Appellant relies on Loper v. Beto, 405 U.S. 473, 92 S.Ct. 1014, 31 L.Ed.2d 374 (1972) (use of prior, unconstitutional conviction for impeachment purposes required grant of a new trial) and Burgett v. Texas, 389 U.S. 109, 88 S.Ct. 258, 19 L.Ed.2d 319 (1967) (use of prior, unconstitutional conviction to enhance punishment under recidivist statute required reversal). These two cases are readily distinguishable from the within matter. Appellant\u2019s murder conviction was not used to impeach or to enhance sentence, or any other collateral matter, but was used to prove an essential element of the offense charged. Despite the fact that the murder conviction was subsequently reversed, appellant was an individual convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d at the time he was charged with possessing the firearm.\n. Nothing in this opinion, however, should be interpreted as lessening our power or commitment to remedying \u201ccruel and unusual\u201d, unconstitutional prison conditions. See Jackson v. Hendrick, 457 Pa. 405, 321 A.2d 603 (1974). In fact, over and above remedying cruel conditions, the legal profession has an obligation to work toward more humane prison conditions. See Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, Annual Report to the American Bar Association by the Chief Justice of the United States, 67 A.B.A.J. 290 (1981)."}
