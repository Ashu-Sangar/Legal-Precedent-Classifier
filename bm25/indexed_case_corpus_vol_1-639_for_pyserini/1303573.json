{"id": "1303573", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Benjamin E. Jones,\nOn January 28, 1957, appellant, Eoselyn K. Smith, and her sixteen year old daughter, Carol Smith, were passengers on an uncrowded streetcar owned and operated by the Pittsburgh Eailways Company, appellee. Appellant and her daughter were seated on a long seat located lengthwise in the extreme right front portion of the streetcar. According to appellant, the streetcar ride was \"rough\u201d and the car \"was jerking just as though he [the motorman] was playing with the pedal\u201d and, as the streetcar approached the so-called Bloomfield stop, passengers expecting to alight at that stop came forward and \u201che [the motorman] jerked that streetcar again\u201d and a man, standing near where appellant was seated, was thrown off balance by the jolt and \"the heel of his foot just stomped right down on the great toe of [appellant\u2019s] left foot\u201d causing severe injuries. Furthermore, according to appellant, the streetcar was about to stop when the jolt occurred; As the car approached the Bloomfield stop, Carol Smith left her seat to ask the motorman for a streetcar schedule and she \"had [her] hand on the railing when the motorman started the car real fast\u201d and she fell to the floor. Except for the statement that other passengers were \"thrust back\u201d there is no evidence that the alleged \"jolt\u201d or \"jerk\u201d affected any other passengers in the streetcar.\nAt trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County that court entered a compulsory nonsuit and, from its refusal to remove this nonsuit and the entry of judgment, this appeal was taken.\nIn \u00bfpassing-upon this appeal we must review the testimony in the light most favorable to the appellant and give to her the benefit of every reasonable inference arising from such testimony: Shuman v. Nolfi, 399 Pa. 211, 159 A. 2d 716.\nThe applicable law is clear. In Staller v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., 339 Pa. 100, 103, 104, 14 A. 2d 289, we stated: \u201cIt is well established by a long line of decisions that testimony indicating that a moving trolley car jerked suddenly or violently is not sufficient, of itself, to establish negligence in its operation. There must be a showing of additional facts and circumstances from which it clearly appears that the movement of the car was so unusual and extraordinary as to be beyond a passenger\u2019s reasonable anticipation, and nothing short of evidence that the allegedly unusual movement had an extraordinary disturbing effect upon other passengers, or evidence of an accident, the manner of the occurrence of which or the effect of which upon the injured person inherently establishes the unusual character of the jolt or jerk, will suffice.\u201d See also: Zager v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., 401 Pa. 516, 165 A. 2d 30; Schilling v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., 394 Pa. 126, 145 A. 2d 688; Herholtz v. West Penn Railways Co., 362 Pa. 501, 66 A. 2d 839; Smith v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., 314 Pa. 541, 171 A. 879; Bollar v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., 153 Pa. Superior Ct. 199, 33 A. 2d 261; Monahan v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., 149 Pa. Superior Ct. 283, 27 A. 2d 534; Waldov v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., 120 Pa. Superior Ct. 304, 182 A. 129.\nAn examination of the testimony produced by appellant fails to show that the movement of this streetcar was so unusual and extraordinary as to be beyond the reasonable anticipation of the passengers therein and it is clear that the evidence falls far short of the standard of proof required to fasten liability upon appellee.\nTilton v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, 231 Pa. 63, 79 A. 877; Sanson v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company, 239 Pa. 505, 86 A. 1069, and Angelo v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., 189 Pa. Superior Ct. 574, 151 A. 2d 867, relied upon by the appellants, are clearly in-apposite.\nJudgment affirmed.\nAccording to the complaint, the \u201cjerk\u201d or \u201cjolt\u201d occurred when the streetcar was \u201cstarted up without warning\u201d by the motorman.\nCarol Smith stated: \u201cI wasn\u2019t holding on to it [the railing], but I had my hand on it\u201d and \u201cI put my hand on the pole just to brace myself while I was going forward . . . .\u201d"}
