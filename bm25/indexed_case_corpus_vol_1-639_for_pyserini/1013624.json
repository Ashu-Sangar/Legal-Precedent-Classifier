{"id": "1013624", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis bill was for the reconveyance of real estate. The court below held that the averment of fraud was not sufficiently specific to sustain the bill, and that the plaintiff had an adequate remedy at law against W. L. Raeder for any unpaid balance of the consideration money. For these reasons the bill was properly dismissed and the cause certified to the law side of the court.\nAppeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
