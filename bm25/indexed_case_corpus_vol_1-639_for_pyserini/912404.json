{"id": "912404", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Brown,\nOn the argument of the appeal in this case our attention was called to some alleged difference between it and the other cases which were tried with it in the court below, but we feel that what we have said in Monongahela Navigation Company v. John A. Wood and Samuel L. Wood, doing business as John A. Wood & Son, ante, p. 47, applies as well to it as to all the other cases. The judgment is therefore affirmed."}
