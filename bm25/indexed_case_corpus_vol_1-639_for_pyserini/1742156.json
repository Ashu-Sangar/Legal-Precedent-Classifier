Kennedy filed an action in trespass in the court of common pleas alleging that his injuries were the result of negligent maintenance of the bridge by the appellee Commission. Preliminary objections, consisting of a demurrer and a motion raising a question of jurisdiction of the court of common pleas, were filed by the Commission. The court of common pleas, being of the view that it lacked jurisdiction, ordered the case transferred to the Commonwealth Court. The demurrer, which relied on the Commission\u2019s entitlement to sovereign immunity, was renewed in the Commonwealth Court, and that court sustained the demurrer. 23 Pa.Cmwlth. 662, 354 A.2d 52 (1976). This appeal followed.\nIn Mayle v. Pennsylvania Department of Highways, 479 Pa. 384, 388 A.2d 709, decided this day, sovereign immunity has been abolished as a defense in trespass actions in the courts of this Commonwealth. Our decision in Mayle is controlling here, and compels the conclusion that appellee\u2019s preliminary objections should not have been sustained on the ground of sovereign immunity. Accordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nEAGEN, C.
