Weir, on behalf of all state court judges who were active and had ten or more years of service as of June 22, 1972. The class members contend that their benefits under the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Code of 1959 have been unconstitutionally impaired by actions of the Commonwealth Compensation Commission taken on June 22, 1972, and by provisions of the revised State Employees\u2019 Retirement Code, enacted in 1974. The Commonwealth Court agreed with class members\u2019 contention and directed appellant, the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, to recalculate class members\u2019 benefits. 54 Pa.Cmwlth. 338, 352, 421 A.2d 1236, 1243 (1980). This record compels the conclusion that the Commonwealth Court correctly granted class members relief. Hence, we affirm.\nI.\nThe Retirement Code of 1959 establishes a comprehensive retirement system for state employees, including class members. Class members\u2019 participation in the system is mandatory, taking effect upon commencement of judicial service. \u00a7 201(1). Under this mandatory system, class members and the Commonwealth are required to contribute to a Retirement Fund. \u00a7\u00a7 301 & 304. Assets of the Fund are reserved for the payment of contributors\u2019 benefits. \u00a7 801. These benefits include the \u201csuperannuation retirement allowances\u201d and \u201cwithdrawal allowances\u201d which class members contend have been impermissibly impaired.\nBefore 1972, when the Compensation Commission took its now-challenged action, a class member\u2019s benefits under the Code of 1959 were determined by two factors: years of service on the bench and \u201cfinal average salary.\u201d Final average salary is defined as the highest annual compensation received by a contributor during any five nonoverlapping periods of twelve consecutive months. \u00a7 102(19). Benefits were calculated by multiplying the member\u2019s first ten years on the bench by the member\u2019s final average salary and then by a multiplier of 0.04. Added to this figure was the product of the member\u2019s additional years on the bench, final average salary, and a multiplier of 0.03.\nSalaries of most class members had been increased in 1966 to $30,000. Final average salaries as of June 22, 1972, thus were $30,000.\nThe retirement benefits of a hypothetical class member with fifteen years of service and a final average salary of $30,000 would be calculated under the Code of 1959 as follows:\nFinal Average\nIllustration No. 1 Multiplier Salary Years Benefits\nFirst 10 years (0.04) X ($30,000) X (10) = $12,000\nYears beyond 10 (0.03) X ($30,000) X (5) = $ 4,500\nTOTAL $16,500.\nBecause class members had served ten or more years as of June 22, 1972, under the Code of 1959 they had the right to separate from service and still leave contributions credited to their account. Upon reaching the \u201csuperannuation retirement age\u201d of sixty, \u00a7 102(14), class members who chose to exercise this right would have been eligible to receive their retirement allowances. This right is termed \u201cvesting.\u201d Additionally, because of their ten or more years of service, class members were eligible as of June 22, 1972, for withdrawal benefits if service terminated involuntarily. See \u00a7\u00a7 402(2)(c) & (d).\nThe Commonwealth Compensation Commission was a group of five private citizens who were directed by the Legislature to make an \u201cexhaustive study\u201d of the salaries and retirement benefits of public officers, including\n\u201cthe Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, the cabinet officers (including the Auditor General and the State Treasurer), the justices and judges of the Supreme Court, the Superior Court, the Commonwealth Court, the courts of common pleas, the Municipal Court of Philadelphia and the Traffic Court of Philadelphia, and the offices and members of the General Assembly.\u201d\nAct of June 16, 1971, P.L. 157, \u00a7 2(b), 65 P.S. Appendix at p. 59 (Supp.1980). The first Report of the Commission was to take effect immediately, and was to have the effect of law,\n\u201cunless, within sixty days following the date of submission thereof the General Assembly shall, by concurrent resolution reject the report, in whole or in part, or enacts legislation. . . . \u201d\nId.\nOn June 22,1972, the Compensation Commission presented its first Report. The report set forth salary increases for members of the Executive, Judicial, and Legislative Branches. For class members, the report increased salaries to $40,000 from the level of $30,000 established in 1966. See supra note 4. However, the report provided that \u201c[e]xisting salaries as established by law prior to the date of this Report ... shall be used in computing . . . \u2018final average salary.\u2019 ...\u201d 1972 P.L. 1988, 65 P.S. Appendix at p. 62.\nBy Concurrent Resolution No. 1 of 1972, dated August 15, 1972, the Legislature limited salary increases set forth in the report to $2,500. 65 P.S. Appendix at p. 71. The Legislature left undisturbed the final average salary freeze contained in the report.\nA subsequent report of the Compensation Commission, presented November 30,1972, reinstated the salary increases set forth in the first report. This subsequent report also sought to justify the position of the Compensation Commission regarding the final average salary freeze:\n\u201cThe Commission, when it established the freeze, was in receipt of an informal but well qualified legal interpretation that this action was permissible under existing legal and judicial guidelines. The reasoning was that the freeze did not constitute a reduction in the amount of pension accrual being earned by the respective members.\u201d\n65 P.S. Appendix at p. 88.\nUnlike the first report, this subsequent report was not acted upon by the Legislature. Thus, as of November, 1972, salaries of class members were set at $40,000. However, final average salaries were frozen at $30,000. Benefits were kept at a pre-1972 figure even though actual salaries had been increased.\nWithout the freeze, a class member\u2019s final average salary would have been free to increase. For the hypothetical class member with fifteen years of service and a final average salary of $40,000, the benefits would have been calculated as follows:\nFinal Average\nIllustration No. 2 Multiplier Salary Years Benefits\nFirst 10 years (0.04) X ($40,000) X (10) = $16,000\nYears beyond 10 (0.03) X ($40,000) X (5) = $ 6,000\nTOTAL $22,000.\nThus, had final average salaries not been frozen, actual salary increases would have been given effect, and retirement allowances would have been $22,000 instead of $16,-500.\nIn 1974, the Legislature established a new retirement system, the State Employees\u2019 Retirement Code (Code of 1974), 71 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5101 et seq. This Code of 1974 abandoned the Compensation Commission\u2019s final average salary freeze. However, in its stead, the Code of 1974 established a system of reduced multipliers for use in the benefits formula. The multiplier of 0.04 for the first ten years of service contained in the Code of 1959 was reduced to 0.03. The multiplier of 0.03 for years beyond the tenth was reduced to .0025. The Code also provided an \u201calternate method,\u201d under which class members were given the \u201coption\u201d of having benefits calculated on the basis of frozen final average salaries and multipliers in effect before the Code of 1974.\nThe reduced multipliers contained in the Code of 1974 had the following effect on the benefits of the class member with fifteen years of service and a final average salary of $40,000:\nFinal Average\nIllustration No. 3 Multiplier Salary Years Benefits\nFirst 10 years (0.03) X ($40,000) X (10) = $12,000\nYears beyond 10 (.0025) X ($40,000) X (5) = $ 4,500\nTOTAL $16,500.\nThus under the Code of 1974, like the final average salary freeze of the Compensation Commission, actual salary increases were not given effect. Benefits were the same before and after June 22, 1972, when actual salaries had first been increased.\nII.\nAppellees, Judges McKenna and Weir, were more than sixty years of age. as of June 22, 1972, the effective date of the final average salary freeze. Both reached the compulsory retirement age of seventy in the Spring of 1978. See Pa.Const. art. V, \u00a7 16(b). In November of 1978, the named judges commenced the present action by filing a two-count complaint, one for mandatory and the other for declaratory relief. Following class certification, the parties entered into a stipulation of facts. Appellees then moved for summary judgment.\nIn an opinion discussing several of the retirement benefits decisions of this Court, the Commonwealth Court en banc (Williams, J.) concluded that the actions of both the Compensation Commission and the Legislature violated art. I, \u00a7 17 of the Pennsylvania Constitution by \u201cimpairing the obligation of contracts.\u201d The Commonwealth Court proceeded on the premise that \u201c[a]n employee who has complied with all conditions necessary to receive a retirement allowance cannot be affected adversely by subsequent legislation which changes the terms of the retirement contract.\u201d 54 Pa.Cmwlth. at 350, 421 A.2d at 1242. According to the Commonwealth Court, class members, who had ten or more years of service as of June 22, 1972, \u201chad satisfied all of the conditions necessary to entitle them to a pension under the 1959 Code.\u201d 54 Pa.Cmwlth. at 351, 421 A.2d at 1243. Thus, the Commonwealth Court held:\n\u201cOnce the plaintiffs had satisfied the conditions of eligibility which governed the right to a pension under the 1959 Code, that Code became the plaintiffs\u2019 contract of retirement. Once the plaintiffs attained eligibility for a pension under the 1959 Code, they gained a vested right to have their retirement allowances computed according to the formula mandated by that Code.\u201d\n54 Pa.Cmwlth. at 351, 421 A.2d at 1243. Judge Wilkinson dissented.\nIII.\nAppellant Retirement Board makes two arguments in support of the final average salary freeze of the Compensation Commission and the reduction of multipliers contained in the Code of 1974. First, assuming that there was a reduction of benefits, the Board asserts that such a reduction was an enhancement of the actuarial soundness of the Retirement Fund. According to the Board, the reduction was permissible because \u201cnone of [the class members],\u201d apparently including those class members who have reached \u201csuperannuation retirement age\u201d of sixty, \u201chave complied with all conditions necessary to receive retirement.\u201d Second, in the alternative, the Board accepts the Commonwealth Court\u2019s view that class members have fulfilled all conditions of eligibility. Mirroring the position taken by the Commonwealth Compensation Commission, the Board asserts that even though salary increases were not given effect in calculating benefits, there is no impairment of the obligation of contracts where, as here, retirement benefits remain constant before and after the challenged actions. (See supra Illustrations No. 1 and No. 3).\nWe are not persuaded by the Board\u2019s contention that no class member has complied with conditions and that reductions thus are permissible. The record is clear, as the Commonwealth Court concluded, that all class members have established their eligibility for retirement benefits. All members have in common ten or more years of judicial service as of June 22, 1972. For those class members such as appellees Judge McKenna and Judge Weir, who were then sixty years of age or older and had served ten or more years, Section 401 of the Code of 1959 assures a retirement allowance upon retirement at or after the \u201csuperannuation age\u201d of sixty. See \u00a7\u00a7 401(1)(e) & (e.1). Those remaining class members with ten or more years of service who had not yet reached the age of sixty also are assured a retirement allowance upon reaching the age of sixty. Section 102(23.1), added by the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 695, provides:\n\u201c \u2018Vesting\u2019 . . . shall mean the right of a member who separates from service after having completed ten (10) or more years of credited service to leave accumulated deductions . .. credited to his account in the fund and upon reaching superannuation retirement age receive a superannuation retirement allowance.\u201d\nSee also \u00a7 401(5). Similarly assured is a withdrawal allowance for those class members who separate from service involuntarily. See \u00a7\u00a7 402(2)(c) & (d). Thus, whether or not a class member is over sixty years of age, all have served ten or more years and are assured their benefits.\nWe must also reject the Board\u2019s argument that, consistent with the obligation of contracts clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution, benefits here were permissibly kept at levels in effect before the final average salary freeze and reduction of multipliers. The Commonwealth Court correctly concluded that before the 1972 final average salary freeze and 1974 multiplier reduction, class members were entitled to a calculation of benefits based on the highest salaries they received during their years of service and the multipliers specified in the Code of 1959. When salary payments were periodically increased in accordance with the legislative judgment, benefits of class members under the retirement system established by the Code of 1959 also were to increase accordingly. The freeze of final average salaries effected in June of 1972 and the reduction of multipliers effected in 1974, disturbed class members\u2019 package of benefits by failing to give recognition to actual salary increases. The previously established eligibility of class members precludes this alteration of the benefits package.\nHere the Commonwealth Court correctly concluded that the challenged-actions impaired class members\u2019 previously established right to have their retirement benefits computed in accordance with the formula mandated by the Code of 1959. Its order must be affirmed.\nOrder affirmed.\nNIX and FLAHERTY, JJ., filed concurring opinions.\nLARSEN, J., filed a concurring opinion in which FLAH-ERTY and KAUFFMAN, JJ., join.\n. Class members are specifically included within the Code\u2019s definition of \u201cstate employe.\u201d See Act of June 1, 1959, P.L. 392, \u00a7 102(6)(a)(ii), formerly 71 P.S. \u00a7 1725-102(6)(a)(ii) (1962).\nA complete version of the Code of 1959, containing relevant amendments, does not appear in Purdon\u2019s Pennsylvania Statutes Annotated. Appellees have prepared a helpful Appendix to their Brief which contains the entire Code, as amended, as of June 22, 1972.\n. \u00a7\u00a7 401(1)(e) & (e.1) (retirement allowance); \u00a7\u00a7 402(2)(c) & (d) (withdrawal allowance).\n. See id.\n. Before June of 1972, salaries were set by the Act of June 1, 1956, P.L. (1955) 1959, \u00a7 4, as amended, Act of January 26, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1602, \u00a7 2.\n. We borrow this illustration, as well as subsequent illustrations, from the Opinion of the Commonwealth Court.\n. See Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 695, adding \u00a7 102(23.1).\n. No challenge is made to the permissibility of the Legislature\u2019s delegation of lawmaking authority to this legislatively created commission or to the concurrent resolution requirement.\n. In 1976, the Legislature repealed the November 1972 Compensation Commission report insofar as it related to judges\u2019 salaries and established a new salary schedule. Under the new schedule, those judges who had been assigned a salary of $40,000 were assigned a new salary of $45,000.\n. Our use of $40,000 as the final average salary of the hypothetical class member is for convenience. From June of 1972 to July of 1976, actual salaries were set at various amounts, including $32,500, $40,-000, and $45,000.\n. Stipulation, Record at 22a-23a.\n. Id.\n. On this record there is no need to express any view on the Board\u2019s assertion that the reductions here are actuarially sound.\nThere is language in Pennsylvania Association of Hospital Physicians, Inc. v. State Employees Retirement Board, 25 Pa.Cmwlth. 632, 361 A.2d 449 (1976), suggesting that contributors under the Code of 1959 with ten or more years of service are nonetheless subject to changes in the system which are actuarially sound. That case did not involve class members. The Commonwealth Court deemed it inappropriate to make its earlier language in that case applicable here. We see no reason to disturb the Commonwealth Court\u2019s view of its own earlier case.\nAmicus, Pennsylvania Conference of State Trial Judges, urges that a contract theory should be applied in this case so that those judges with less then ten years of service, not now before this Court, could also prevail. However, the record now before us makes it unnecessary to address the argument presented by the amicus."}
