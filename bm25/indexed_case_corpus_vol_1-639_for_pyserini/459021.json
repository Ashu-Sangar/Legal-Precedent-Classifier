{"id": "459021", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Cpiiee Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the decree of the court below dissolving a preliminary injunction. Plaintiff brought a bill to restrain the defendant\u2019s alleged trespassing over plaintiff\u2019s land, \u201cboth on foot and by automobile\u201d. It was alleged that the trespasses were \u201calmost daily\u201d and \u201cwithout the shadow of right\u201d and that they interfere with the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cuse and cultivation of the said field\u201d. In plaintiff-appellant\u2019s history of the case it is stated that \u201cthe use of the disputed way as an accommodation and a short-cut was occasional, intermittent and infrequent\u201d.\nThe court below found as facts the following: that plaintiff became the owner of the land in question by deed dated July 1, 1940, that for 33 years prior to the hearing in this case, defendant Mary Plymire, owned and occupied a parcel of land adjacent to the lands of plaintiff, that over these lands of plaintiff there exists a road or way, leading from lands of defendant to a state highway, and that \u201cdefendants notoriously, adversely and continuously used said road or way for passage on foot or by vehicle for more than 21 years prior to the institution of this proceeding and that they and their predecessors in title and others\u201d so used this way \u201cfor more than fifty years\u201d.\nTo these findings of fact the court properly applied the principle of law enunciated by Chief Justice Black in Garret v. Jackson, 20 Pa. 331, as follows: \u201cBut where one uses an easement whenever he sees fit, without asking leave, and without objection, it is adverse, and an uninterrupted adverse enjoyment for twenty-two years is a title which cannot be afterwards disputed. Such enjoyment, without evidence to explain how it began, is presumed to have been in pursuance of a full and unqualified grant. The owner of the land has the burden of proving that the use of the easement was under some license, indulgence, or special contract, inconsistent with a claim of right by the other party\u201d. This principle was reiterated by the Superior Court in Wedge v. Schrock, 146 Pa. Superior Ct. 425. The court below further held that \u201cplaintiff failed to meet the burden placed upon it of proving that the use of the easement had its inception on some source other than as legally presumed, and accordingly, the presumption in favor of defendants\u2019 claim stands unaffected\u201d.\nThere is ample testimony to support the court\u2019s findings of fact. One of the defendants, Mary Plymire, testified that she had resided for 33 years on lands adjoining the plaintiff\u2019s lands and that the disputed \u201croad\u201d over those lands \u201chas been open for 33 years\u201d, that she and her family had used it, \u201cgoing to the mail box most every day\u201d and that she and her family use this road \u201cwith their hauling\u201d. She said the road was open when she came to the neighborhood and that \u201cprior to this time there was no objection to such use of the road\u201d. Her testimony was fully corroborated by James A. Simpson and Henry L. Lowry, each of whom had resided in that neighborhood for at least half a century. Mr. Simpson said the road in question \u201cwas open and in use by the public when he first came to know it.\u201d Mr. Lowry testified that he never heard questioned \u201cthe right of the public to use this road\u201d though he added: \u201cWhen I travelled the road I don\u2019t know as I saw or met anybody on it.\u201d On cross-examination he said he used this road \u201cas a short-cut going over to McCalls. It was the only road I could get to them handy. People when they wanted to use it always used it\u201d. In appellant\u2019s paper book it is stated: \u201cThe disputed way over the Plaintiff-Appellant\u2019s field was used as a short-cut or accommodation for folks in that neighborhood, although little or no use had been made of said disputed way recently according to three witnesses called by the DefendantsAppellees\u201d.\nAppellant contends that the use of the disputed way was permissive. It cites the testimony of Mrs. Plymire to the effect that when she first went to live on her farm \u201cMr. Dickie gave her permission to go over his field\u201d. If before that time the way had not been used by the public Mrs. Plymire\u2019s testimony would have legal significance, but as the court below found from the testimony, \u201cthe way had existed for many years, possibly 20 or more prior to the date of the alleged permission. . . . It could be argued that the so-called permission given by Mr. Dickie was in recognition of an earlier unqualified grant of which he had knowledge\u201d.\nAlex Bennet who for 19 years, beginning in 1919, owned the farm on which the \u201cway\u201d is located testified that then \u201cthis way existed\u201d and was \u201cused by the neighbors\u201d. He said he \u201cnever questioned their right\u201d to use it.\nH. W. Stephens testified that he had travelled this \u201cway\u201d for 38 or 39 years and that it had been used by \u201chimself and other people without hindrance up to the present time \u201cduring those 39 years\u201d.\nSince there is ample evidence to support the findings of fact of the court below, the conclusion that \u201cthe defendants have by prescription acquired a legal right to use said road or way without let or hindrance by plaintiff\u201d logically followed.\nThe decree is affirmed, at appellant\u2019s cost."}
