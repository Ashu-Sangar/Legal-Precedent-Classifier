MacGregor, 912 A.2d 315 (Pa.Super.2006) that only the court, and not probation officers, can impose the terms of probation is in conflict with 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9798.3, enacted in 2007, which directs that the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole and County probation authorities in Megan\u2019s Law may impose supervision conditions that include offender tracking."}
