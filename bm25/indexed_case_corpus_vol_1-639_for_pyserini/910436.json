{"id": "910436", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThere appears to be no error in this record, of which the defendant has any just reason to complain. The decree was fully warranted by the facts correctly found by the learned referee and approved by the court. All that can be profitably said in relation to the questions involved will be found in the clear and satisfactory opinion of the learned president of the common pleas. On that opinion, the decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
