{"id": "1763815", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nWe are again presented with a challenge to the constitutionality of section 3732 of the Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3732. Section 3732 defines \u201chomicide by vehicle\u201d as follows:\n\u201cAny person who unintentionally causes the death of another person while engaged in the violation of any law of this Commonwealth or municipal ordinance applying to the operation or use of a vehicle or to the regulation of traffic is guilty of homicide by vehicle, a misdemeanor of the first degree, when the violation is the cause of death.\u201d\nThis is a pre-trial appeal in which the Commonwealth seeks reversal of an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County holding this \u201chomicide by vehicle\u201d provision unconstitutionally vague. We reverse.\nThe victim, Edward Romano, was a cameraman for KDKA-TV, Pittsburgh. On September 9, 1979, Romano went to the Atlantic Richfield Oil Company (ARCO) terminal at 57th and Butler Streets in Pittsburgh to film picketing and other strike-related activity of ARCO employees. Romano began to film while standing in the center of Butler Street.\nThe court of common pleas had previously issued both an injunction against mass picketing and a writ of assistance. Deputy sheriffs and city police, at the scene to ensure passage of ARCO tractor-trailers, requested Romano to move from the center of Butler Street to the adjoining sidewalk. Romano did so and resumed filming.\nSix ARCO vehicles then began to leave the terminal. As the vehicles departed, the passageway through the pickets and onto Butler Street continually narrowed as spectators and picketers, in numbers exceeding the court\u2019s order, crowded the terminal exit. The vehicles were not moving at an excessive speed.\nBy the time the driver of the last vehicle, appellee Richard Field, attempted to negotiate the vehicle through the narrowed exit, police had to push back the crowd of picketers and spectators. Romano, still standing on the sidewalk and about one foot from the curb, continued to film the activity. As appellee\u2019s vehicle proceeded through the exit, the side of the trailer struck Romano, throwing him to the sidewalk. Romano was fatally injured when run over by the trailer\u2019s rear wheels. Out of fear that a riot might ensue, police did not stop appellee until he had cleared the terminal area.\nOnce stopped, appellee was arrested and charged with driving on the sidewalk, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3703, reckless driving, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3714, and homicide by vehicle, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3732. After a coroner\u2019s hearing, a deputy coroner dismissed the reckless driving charge, but held appellee on the charges of driving on the sidewalk and homicide by vehicle. The district attorney then filed an information against appellee which included the homicide by vehicle charge.\nOn January 16, 1980, appellee filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss the information on several grounds, including a claim that section 3732 is unconstitutionally vague. Following oral argument on the motion, the court of common pleas agreed with appellee\u2019s vagueness claim and, on January 31, granted the motion to dismiss. The Commonwealth then took this direct appeal from a final order of a court of common pleas holding a state statute unconstitutional. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 722(7). The Attorney General has filed a brief in support of section 3732.\nVery recently in Commonwealth v. Burt, 490 Pa. 172, 415 A.2d 89 (1980), this Court unanimously reversed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Warren County similarly holding section 3732 unconstitutionally vague. There, this Court stated:\n\u201cWith unmistakable clarity, section 3732 defines \u2018homicide by vehicle\u2019 as a death caused by any person\u2019s conduct violating law or municipal ordinance applying to vehicles or traffic regulation. This section does not employ \u2018ambiguous\u2019 words, \u2018archaic classifications,\u2019 or words with \u2018numerous and varied\u2019 meanings. Compare Colautti v. Franklin, supra [439 U.S. 379, 99 S.Ct. 675, 58 L.Ed.2d 596] (\u2018viability\u2019 determination requirement of statute regulating physicians\u2019 performance of abortions void), Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, supra [405 U.S. 156, 92 S.Ct. 839, 31 L.Ed.2d 110] (\u2018vagrancy\u2019 ordinance drafted in terms of archaic English poor laws invalid), and Lanzetta v. State of New Jersey, 306 U. S. 451, 59 S.Ct. 618, [83 L.Ed. 888] (1939) (violating statute making it crime to be member of \u2018gang\u2019). Accordingly, any vagueness challenge must be rejected. See United States ex rel. Almeida v. Rundle, 383 F.2d 421, 426 (3d Cir. 1967) (upholding former felony-murder statute).\u201d\n490 Pa. at 523, 415 A.2d at 92. We agree with the Commonwealth that here too any vagueness challenge must be rejected.\nBurt is not dispositive of this case, however, for here appellee contends section 3732 is unconstitutional on an additional ground. Section 3732 is a first-degree misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment of up to five years. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1104(1). Relying primarily upon Commonwealth v. Koczwara, 397 Pa. 575, 155 A.2d 825 (1959), appellee maintains section 3732 unconstitutionally imposes criminal liability without fault. Like the vagueness challenge, this challenge must also be rejected.\nIn Koczwara, the undisputed record indicated that minors purchased liquor from a bartender employed by the defendant, a liquor licensee, outside the defendant\u2019s presence and without the defendant\u2019s personal knowledge. The defendant was convicted of two counts of permitting minors to frequent his licensed premises and one count of permitting sales to minors. The court of common pleas sentenced the defendant, a previous offender, to imprisonment of three months and imposed costs and a fine of $500.\nFinding \u201cno case in any jurisdiction which has permitted a prison term for a vicarious offense,\u201d 397 Pa. at 586,155 A.2d at 830, this Court concluded that \u201cpunishment of imprisonment deprives the defendant of due process of law under these facts.\u201d Id. In so holding, this Court stated:\n\u201cIt would be unthinkable to impose vicarious criminal responsibility in cases involving true crimes. Although to hold a principal criminally liable might possibly be an effective means of enforcing law and order, it would do violence to our more sophisticated modern-day concepts of justice. Liability for all true crimes, wherein an offense carries with it a jail sentence, must be based exclusively upon personal causation. It can be readily imagined that even a licensee who is meticulously careful in the choice of his employees cannot supervise every single act of the subordinates. A man\u2019s liberty cannot rest on so frail a reed as whether his employee will commit a mistake in judgment. See Sayre, Criminal Responsibility For Act of Another, 43 Harv.L.Rev 689 (1930).\u201d\n397 Pa. at 585-86, 155 A.2d at 830. Accordingly, the Court invalidated the imprisonment portion of the judgment of sentence.\nHere, however, unlike in Koczwara, there is no effort to impose a prison term in the absence of culpable conduct. As the Attorney General recognizes, section 3732 requires the Commonwealth to prove that appellee has deviated from the standard of care established by section 3703, the underlying Vehicle Code provision allegedly violated here. Section 3703 provides:\n\u201cNo person shall drive any vehicle except a human-powered vehicle upon a sidewalk or sidewalk area except upon a permanent or duly authorized temporary driv\u00e9way.\u201d\nConsistent with the culpability requirement, section 3703 leaves for determination at trial whether appellee knew, or should have known, he engaged in the conduct claimed to be in violation of that section. Thus, for example, it remains to be decided if a reasonable driver could, in view of the congestion at the terminal exit, know where the sidewalk was or, indeed, if a sidewalk existed. Section 3732 also requires the Commonwealth to prove that appellee\u2019s alleged violation of section 3703 caused the victim\u2019s death. As the Attorney General points out, at the very least, death must be a \u201cprobable consequence\u201d of appellee\u2019s culpable conduct. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 303(d).\nAccordingly, our review satisfies us that here, unlike in Koczwara, section 3732 requires the Commonwealth to establish that it was the actor\u2019s conduct which caused death. This requirement of personal responsibility under a section 3732 prosecution precludes successful constitutional challenge.\nOrder of the court of common pleas reversed, charge of homicide by vehicle reinstated, and case remanded for further appropriate proceedings.\nFLAHERTY, J., joins this opinion and files a concurring opinion.\nEAGEN, C. J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. Appellee\u2019s motion also alleges section 3732 violates (1) due process because it imposes criminal sanctions (including possible imprisonment) upon \u201cunintentional conduct,\u201d and (2) equal protection because\n\u201cA. The statute involves a suspect classification;\nB. Impinges upon a fundamental right;\nC. The classification does not have a rational relationship to the legislative purpose of the statute.\u201d\nAppellee pursues only his due process contention on this appeal. See infra text.\n. In its explanatory opinion, the court expressed the view that the statute unconstitutionally imposes criminal liability in the absence of culpable conduct. This view we reject. See infra text.\n. As in every criminal prosecution, the Commonwealth\u2019s proof must be beyond a reasonable doubt. See e.g., Commonwealth v. Busier, 445 Pa. 359, 362, 284 A.2d 783, 784 (1971).\n. In our view it was the legislative judgment in enacting section 3732 to expand the scope of criminal liability for violations of the Vehicle Code causing death. Compare 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2504; Commonwealth v. Busler, supra note 3; Commonwealth v. Clowser, 212 Pa.Super. 208, 239 A.2d 870 (1968)."}
