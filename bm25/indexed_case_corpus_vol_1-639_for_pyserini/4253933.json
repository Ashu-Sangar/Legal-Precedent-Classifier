Lucarelli, 601 Pa. 185, 971 A.2d 1173 (2009) (waiver of right to counsel is intentional and voluntary relinquishment of known right; forfeiture of right to counsel, by contrast, does not require that defendant intend to relinquish right but may result from defendant\u2019s extremely serious or dilatory conduct). The remand is not to be construed as an expression of view on whether, in fact, respondent forfeited the right to counsel."}
