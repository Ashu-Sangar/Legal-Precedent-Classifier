{"id": "1290508", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Jones,\nThe plaintiff appeals from an order refusing its motion for judgment on the pleadings for a portion of the claim for which it brought this action in assumpsit. There is no procedure for a summary judgment for a portion of a claim that is not unequivocally and unqualifiedly admitted to be due by the defendant\u2019s answer or, stated otherwise, is only contingently admitted by the defendant to be due upon the plaintiff\u2019s compliance with certain unperformed conditions.\nThe procedural situation in the instant case is well described in the opinion of President Judge Sloane for the court en banc as follows:\n\u201cWe suppose plaintiff\u2019s idea is that the $2,500 is an amount admitted to be due.\n\u201cThere are two possible ways for the $2,500 to be considered as \u2018admitted to be due.\u2019 The first is under the compromise agreement. That is, plaintiff is entitled to receive the final instalment under the compromise. But this is so only if plaintiff is willing to be bound by the compromise, to recognize that by paying the final $2,500, defendant will have satisfied the compromise, and hence that the underlying claim would be discharged.\n\u201cBut this is not plaintiff\u2019s prayer. Plaintiff in short wants us to award it the $2,500 under the compromise agreement, yet plaintiff repudiates the compromise agreement. It wants the $2,500 under the compromise agreement but will not abide it. Plaintiff can have the agreement\u2019s sum but, if so, must recognize the agreement. It cannot be master of its own preference. Defendant, by its answer, has a right to the factual determination of its rights in the compromise agreement and plaintiff cannot forfeit that right simply because it wants its $2,500. Defendant\u2019s obligation to pay this sum is not pure. That money is presently obsignare.\n\u201cThere is a dispute over the compromise agreement, a question as to the validity of the tender, matters plainly not for summary disposition.\n\u201cThe second possible way for awarding plaintiff $2,500 would be as a partial payment \u2014 an instalment as it were \u2014 on the underlying claim which now stands at $18,157. But nowhere has defendant admitted a liability for the underlying claim. Bather, its answer specifically denies the \u2018extent and value\u2019 of that claim.\n\u201cPlaintiff would have us infer from the fact that defendant entered into the compromise agreement that it has thereby admitted liability, at least to the extent of the compromise amount. That inference is error. Rather, the underlying claim raises an issue of fact for trial.\u201d\nOrder affirmed."}
