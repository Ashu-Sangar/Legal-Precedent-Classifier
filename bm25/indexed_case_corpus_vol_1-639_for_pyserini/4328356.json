The issue, as stated by Petitioner, is:\nWhether the Superior Court majority\u2019s precedential Opinion has sub silentio nullified the statutory employer doctrine and effectively overruled this Court\u2019s decision in McDonald v. Levinson Steel Co., 302 Pa. 287, 153 A. 424 (1930), by grafting a fact question onto the McDonald analysis that can never be answered in a way that allows the statutory employer doctrine to apply?"}
