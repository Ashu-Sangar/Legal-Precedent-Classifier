{"id": "5653674", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice CASTILLE.\nAppellant/candidate Timothy J. Carroll appeals from the order of the Commonwealth Court granting appellee/objector Dennis Garvey\u2019s petition to set aside Carroll\u2019s Nomination Petition for the Republican nomination for the office of Representative in the General Assembly from the 117th Legislative District, Wyoming County, Pennsylvania. The effect of the order below was to strike Carroll\u2019s name from the primary ballot. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the order setting aside Carroll\u2019s nomination petition and we order that Carroll\u2019s name be restored to the primary ballot.\nOn March 1, 2006, Carroll, the Mayor of Dallas Borough, Wyoming County, filed a timely nomination petition with the Secretary of the Commonwealth seeking to have his name placed on the Republican Primary ballot for the Office of Representative in the General Assembly from the 117th Legislative District. Carroll contemporaneously filed a Statement of Financial Interests, as required by Section 1104(b) of the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act (\u201cEthics Act\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d), 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101 et seq.:\n(1) Any candidate for a State-level public office shall file a statement of financial interests for the preceding calendar year with the commission on or before the last day for filing a petition to appear on the ballot for election. A copy of the statement of financial interests shall also be appended to such petition.\n* * * *\n(3) No petition to appear on the ballot for election shall be accepted by the respective State or local election officials unless the petition has appended thereto a statement of financial interests as set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2). Failure to file the statement in accordance with the provisions of this chapter shall, in addition to any other penalties provided, be a fatal defect to a petition to appear on the ballot.\nId. \u00a7 1104(b). Block 4 of the Statement of Financial Interests form (which is produced by the State Ethics Commission) directs the filer to list his \u201cPUBLIC POSITION OR PUBLIC OFFICE (member, Commissioner, job title, etc.).\u201d The Block allows the filer to check the position(s) he is seeking, holds or held. Within that block, Carroll listed the positions he holds as \u201cMAYOR\u201d and \u201cLEGISLATIVE AID HOUSE,\u201d and he listed the position he was seeking as \u201cPA HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVE [sic].\u201d\nOn March 14, 2006, Garvey, a registered Republican and qualified elector in the 117th Legislative District, filed a petition to set aside Carroll\u2019s nomination petition, alleging that Carroll\u2019s Statement of Financial Interests was \u201cfatally\u201d defective under Section 1104(b). Specifically, Garvey claimed that Carroll had failed to list two affiliations he was required to disclose pursuant to Section 1105(b) of the Act, which provides, in relevant part:\n(b) Required information. \u2014 The statement shall include the following information for the prior calendar year with regard to the person required to file the statement:\n(1) Name, address and public position.\n* * * *\n(8) Any office, directorship or employment of any nature whatsoever in any business entity.\n65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1105(b)(1), (8). First, Garvey alleged that Carroll violated subsection (b)(1) because he failed to list in Block 4 the unpaid public position he held as a board member and Assistant Secretary of the Dallas Area Municipal Authority (\u201cDAMA\u201d). Second, Garvey alleged that Carroll violated subsection (b)(8) because, in Block 13 of the Financial Statement \u2014 a block requiring filers to list \u201cOFFICE, DIRECTORSHIP OR EMPLOYMENT IN ANY BUSINESS\u201d \u2014 Carroll failed to list his uncompensated presidency of the not-for-profit \u201cTimothy J. Carroll\u2019s Mayors Club of Dallas Borough\u201d (\u201cMayors Club\u201d). Either or both defects, Garvey alleged, rendered Carroll\u2019s nomination petition fatally defective.\nOn March 20, 2006, the Commonwealth Court, per the Honorable James R. Kelley, Senior Judge, held a hearing on Garvey\u2019s Petition. The sole issue before the Court relevant here was the legal question of whether the above two omissions on Carroll\u2019s Statement of Financial Interests rendered it \u201cfatally defective\u201d under Section 1104(b)(3), thus warranting that Carroll\u2019s nomination petition be set aside.\nAt the hearing, Carroll testified that he created the Mayors Club to fund community projects. The Club is funded entirely by public donations, including donations by Carroll and people serving on borough council who donate their public salaries. Carroll testified that he gives the Club his entire salary of $600. The average balance in the Club\u2019s account is approximately $3,000.00. This money is used to finance projects that cannot be funded with taxpayer money. For example, the Club assisted the local Boy Scout troop, donated $300 to a scholarship fund, and gave $200 to a group that was assisting victims of Hurricane Katrina. Projects undertaken by the Club are discussed with borough council and reflected in the minutes of borough council meetings. Carroll receives no salary, income, or any benefit in kind from the Club. When asked why he did not report his association with the Club on his Statement of Financial Interests, Carroll responded that he viewed the Club to be part of his duties as Mayor, and that he received no compensation in connection with it. N.T. 3/20/06, 14-19.\nWith regard to his positions with DAMA, Carroll testified that he was appointed as a consequence of his position as Mayor, and that he received no salary, income or any other benefit as a result of serving on DAMA. Carroll further testified that he did not report this position on his Statement of Financial Interest for the same reason he did not report the Mayors Club: he received no compensation for his work and he believed his service to be part of his mayoral duties. Id. at 20.\nOn March 22, 2006, Judge Kelley issued a single-judge order and memorandum opinion which granted Garvey\u2019s petition and \u201cregrettably\u201d set aside Carroll\u2019s nomination petition. In Judge Kelley\u2019s view, the case was \u201ccontrolled by\u201d In re Nomination Petition of Anastasio, 820 A.2d 880 (Pa.Cmwlth. 2003), aff'd per curiam without opinion, 573 Pa. 512, 827 A.2d 373 (2003). In Anastasio, the candidate (there, for local office) had entered \u201cNone\u201d in block 10 of the Financial Statement \u2014 a block which directs disclosure of \u201cdirect or indirect sources of income.\u201d The candidate in fact had employment income. An objector filed a petition to strike, alleging a fatal defect; the trial court agreed and struck the nomination petition; a three-judge panel of the Commonwealth Court affirmed the order in a brief published opinion; and this Court affirmed per curiam, by a vote of 4-3. Judge Kelley reasoned that, like the candidate in Anastasio, Carroll had \u201cfailed to designate anything on his financial statement from which a reviewer could ascertain that he served as the President of the Club and on the Board of DAMA.\u201d\nJudge Kelley also deemed the total non-disclosures here to be sufficient to distinguish the case from In re Nomination Petition of Kerry Benninghoff, 578 Pa. 402, 852 A.2d 1182 (2004). In Benninghoff, the candidate was an incumbent state representative seeking reelection who failed to list the Commonwealth as a direct source of income in Block 10. Benninghoff did, however, advert to his salaried position as a state representative (a salary which was of public record) in multiple other blocks on the form, and he disclosed supplemental income. This Court held that Benninghoff had \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the requirements of the Ethics Act, and thus he should be permitted to amend the form. We therefore reversed the decision below, which had granted a petition to set aside Benninghoff s nomination petition.\nFinally, although Judge Kelley acknowledged Carroll\u2019s argument that the non-disclosures at issue here involved uncompensated service, he summarily rejected that claim as follows: \u201c[t]he Ethics Act and the form instructions require identification of these offices regardless of compensation or financial interest.\u201d Slip op. at 7-8.\nIn his brief to this Court, Carroll argues that the fatal defect rule in Section 1104(b)(3), and as construed in Anastasio, does not apply to a failure to report his non-compensated positions with DAMA and the Mayors Club. Carroll notes that the Act speaks to financial interests, is designed to expose potential financial conflicts, and thereby acts to strengthen the faith and confidence of the people in their government by assuring the impartiality and honesty of public officials. Brief for Appellant, 7 (citing 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101.1(a)). Carroll argues that the fatal defect rule is designed to ensure that financial disclosures are fully and timely made, so that they may inform the public about a candidate\u2019s financial interests, thus facilitating the ability of the public to assess whether those financial interests are likely to influence, or conflict with, the candidate\u2019s execution of his public responsibilities. Consistently with this purpose, Carroll notes, the rule to date has been applied to terminate candidacies only where the candidate failed to file a timely financial statement, filed a timely financial statement but failed to disclose the sources of income or debts, or filed the financial statement in the wrong location. Brief for Appellant, 7-8.\nCarroll notes that none of the heretofore-recognized reasons for disqualification exists here. He filed his nomination petition and Statement of Financial Interests in timely fashion; he filed in the right place; and he did not fail to disclose any relevant financial interest. On the last point, Carroll notes that, in the cases where this Court has passed upon alleged defects in the substance of financial statements, we have applied the fatal defect rule only where there were \u201cerrors of omission relating to a candidate\u2019s financial interests.\u201d Id. at 9, citing In re Nominating Petitions of Braxton, 583 Pa. 35, 874 A.2d 1143 (2005) (per curiam) and In re Nomination Petition of Katofsky, 582 Pa. 557, 872 A.2d 1196 (2005) (p er curiam). See and contrast Benninghojf, supra (fatal defect rule not applied where candidate in substantial compliance with requirement to disclose financial interests). Carroll emphasizes that it is undisputed that there is no financial interest implicated in either of the positions he has been accused of wrongly failing to report. Thus, he did not deprive the voting public of information about his financial interests that would allow voters to assess whether those interests potentially conflict with the public trust. Instead, he has been denied the opportunity to appear on the ballot because his full disclosure of his financial interests did not include an exhaustive summary of his non-financial public associations. Carroll maintains that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s extension of the fatal defect rule to failures to report non-financial interests is an \u201cunprecedented expansion\u201d which cannot be squared with the terms or purpose of the Ethics Act and the financial statement requirement.\nBecause he receives no compensation from, and had no financial interest in, either of the associations he failed to report, Carroll argues that his Financial Statement cannot be deemed defective. He then cogently argues that:\nTo decide otherwise would mandate the reporting of any and every voluntary or not-for-profit affiliation which a candidate or public official may hold for fear of falling into the technical trap created by the Commonwealth Court\u2019s ruling ..., such as President of the Parent Teachers Association, Treasurer of the Township Youth Soccer Program, Chair of a church committee and a myriad of others.\nThe Legislature intended to require the disclosure of potential financial entanglements by Commonwealth officials and employees. The financial disclosure rules are not intended to deter those serving as elected officials from continuing to contribute to community life in other ways. To the contrary, the Legislature recognized that civically active citizens are likely to both run for political office and to continue to participate in ordinary civil life. See 65 Pa.C.S. [\u00a7 ] 1101.1(b) (\u201cIt is recognized that many public officials, including most local officials and members of the General Assembly, are citizen-officials who bring to their public office the knowledge and concerns of ordinary citizens and taxpayers. They should not be discouraged from maintaining their contacts with their community through their occupations and professions.\u201d).\nHere, Garvey seeks to disqualify Carroll not because he failed to disclose positions for which he is compensated or businesses in which he has a financial interest but merely because he failed to list his position with a non-profit organization and his service on a municipal authority, both undertaken solely as an adjunct to his official duties as borough mayor.\nBrief for Appellant, 9-10.\nIn addition to his broad argument stressing that the financial statement required by the Ethics Act is concerned only with financial interests, Carroll also addresses each of the affiliations at issue. With respect to his role in the Mayors Club, which Garvey claimed had to be disclosed as a \u201cbusiness entity\u201d affiliation under Section 1105(b)(8), Carroll notes that the term \u201cbusiness entity\u201d is not defined in the Ethics Act. But, Carroll argues, the elemental term \u201cbusiness\u201d is defined in the Act, and in a way that makes plain that it encompasses only for-profit entities: \u201c[a]ny corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, firm, enterprise, franchise, association, organization, self-employed individual, holding company, joint stock company, receivership, trust or any legal entity organized for profit.\u201d 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102 (emphasis supplied). Under the plain language of this definition, Carroll argues that his failure to list his position as president of the non-profit Mayors Club did not violate the Ethics Act because there is \u201csimply nothing\u201d in the Act that requires disclosing affiliations with nonprofit business entities. Moreover, Carroll argues, even if this plain language could be construed to be ambiguous, it would be inequitable and unfair to fault him for failing to predict such an interpretation. Carroll accurately notes that there is no case decision, and no rulings or information from the Ethics Commission, to warn candidates of such a non-textual interpretation. Carroll notes that the Act explicitly recognizes the need for \u201cclear guidelines,\u201d see 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101.1(a), yet the novel interpretation invoked against him below was not based upon any extant, clear guideline.\nTurning to DAMA, where his affiliation is as an unpaid Board member and Assistant Secretary, Carroll argues that he serves on the Authority only by virtue of his position as Mayor. Because he listed his mayoralty, Carroll argues, he also effectively disclosed this lesser-included affiliation. In any event, Carroll notes, nothing in the fact of this position, which is but an incident of his (disclosed) public position as Mayor, speaks to his financial situation, as he has no financial stake in DAMA and he receives no compensation. Thus, had he listed the affiliation, Carroll argues, it would have contributed nothing to the public\u2019s understanding of his financial interests.\nFinally, and in the alternative, Carroll argues that even if his Financial Statement could be deemed defective for failing to list these two unpaid associations, he should be permitted to amend it pursuant to the substantial compliance rule announced in Benninghoff.\nGarvey counters with an absolutist position. He argues that Carroll\u2019s \u201cerrors of omission\u201d were fatal defects and thus his nomination petition was rightly set aside. Thus, in Garvey\u2019s view, Section 1105(b)(8) of the Act \u201cmandates\u201d that a candidate \u201cdisclose any office of any nature whatsoever in any business entity.\u201d Brief of Appellee, 6. Carroll\u2019s position as president of the Mayors Club therefore had to be reported on his Financial Statement. Garvey stresses the broad language of the provision when read in isolation, i.e., \u201cany office\u201d of \u201cany nature\u201d in \u201cany business entity.\u201d Garvey then notes that the Mayors Club is an active non-profit corporation registered with the Pennsylvania Department of State, and Carroll is its president and sole officer. Therefore, Garvey argues, Carroll had to report this business \u201coffice\u201d and his failure to do so was a fatal defect. Notably, Garvey does not address Carroll\u2019s argument that the Act defines \u201cbusiness\u201d in terms of for-profit entities.\nWith regard to Carroll\u2019s positions with DAMA, Garvey argues that Section 1105(b)(1) \u201cobligates\u201d candidates to disclose public positions they hold or held. Garvey then argues that appointed members of municipal authorities are public officials, and therefore, Carroll\u2019s failure to report his position with DAMA was an independent fatal defect. Moreover, Garvey disputes Carroll\u2019s argument that his service on DAMA was a mandatory incident of his elected position as Mayor; to the contrary, Garvey maintains, this association was \u201cpurely voluntary.\u201d\nGarvey also disputes Carroll\u2019s argument that he substantially complied with the Act. Garvey argues that Carroll\u2019s omissions in Blocks 4 and 13 involve associations not otherwise accounted for in the Financial Statement, and that fact renders inoperable the substantial compliance rule set forth in Benninghoff. Garvey concludes that either or both of Carroll\u2019s omissions rendered his Statement of Financial Interests fatally defective under Section 1104(b)(3) of the Act, warranting that his nomination petition be set aside.\nNotably, at the outset of his otherwise straightforward argument, Garvey acknowledges that the \u201cpurpose\u201d of the fatal defect rule is \u201cto insure public disclosures of relevant financial information.\u201d Brief of Appellee, 10 (emphasis added). Yet, Garvey never discusses the fact that neither of Carroll\u2019s unreported positions implicated his financial information. Nor does Garvey argue, for example, that there is some indirect way in which Carroll\u2019s financial situation was implicated by these non-financial affiliations. Instead, Garvey focuses on the language of the Section 1105(b) affiliations in isolation, separate and apart from the overall financial emphasis of the form and the Act, as well as the purpose he has generally acknowledged, and then declares that any omission of information amounts to a fatal defect. Thus, there is a missing essential ingredient when Garvey later declares that the non-disclosures here deprived voters of \u201can opportunity to accurately inspect Carroll\u2019s financial portfolio.\u201d Id., 17.\nIn reviewing an order concerning the validity of a challenge to a nomination petition, this Court may reverse only if the findings of fact are not supported by substantial evidence, there was an abuse of discretion, or there was an error of law. In re Nomination Petition of Driscoll, 577 Pa. 501, 847 A.2d 44, 49 (2004); In re Nomination Petition of Flaherty, 564 Pa. 671, 770 A.2d 327, 331 (2001). In this case, the necessary facts are not in dispute, and there is no discretionary ruling of the court below at issue. The question, instead, concerns the proper interpretation of the Ethics Act. As the question is one of statutory interpretation, a purely legal issue, this Court\u2019s substantive review is plenary and non-deferential. E.g. Commonwealth v. Gilmour Manufacturing Co., 573 Pa. 143, 822 A.2d 676, 679 (2003). The object of interpretation and construction of all statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a); In re Canvass of Absentee Ballots of November 4, 2003 General Election, 577 Pa. 231, 843 A.2d 1223, 1230 (2004). When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, their plain language is generally the best indication of legislative intent. Bowser v. Blom, 569 Pa. 609, 807 A.2d 830, 835 (2002); Pennsylvania Financial Responsibility Assigned Claims Plan v. English, 541 Pa. 424, 664 A.2d 84, 87 (1995); i Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). A reviewing court should resort to other considerations to determine legislative intent only when the words of the statute are not explicit. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). See Canvass of Absentee Ballots, 843 A.2d at 1230 (citing O\u2019Rourke v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Corrections, 566 Pa. 161, 778 A.2d 1194, 1201 (2001)). In ascertaining legislative intent, this Court is guided by, among other things, the primary purpose of the statute, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(4), and the consequences of a particular interpretation. Id. \u00a7 1921(c)(6). See Vitae Corp. v. Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Rozanc), 578 Pa. 574, 854 A.2d 481, 485 (2004).\nPreliminarily, we note that the court below plainly erred to the extent it deemed the issue here to be \u201ccontrolled by\u201d the Anastasio case. Anastasio involved a failure to disclose a direct source of income on a candidate\u2019s Statement of Financial Interests. In contrast, Carroll poses the very distinct question of whether and when a failure to disclose non-financial associations on a Statement of Financial Interests should trigger operation of the fatal defect rule. Anastasio does not purport to resolve that question. Nor does Benninghoff resolve the question as that case, too, involved the question of whether what was unquestionably a financial interest \u2014 the incumbent\u2019s legislative salary \u2014 was adequately accounted for in his financial statement. Although Anastasio and Benninghoff provide a backdrop for the current inquiry, and the \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d rule obviously may have applications broader than were at issue in Benninghoff, neither case resolves the distinct question we must decide.\nThe intent and purpose of the Ethics Act is not shrouded in mystery. The Act is part of the \u201caccountability\u201d section of Title 65, which governs \u201cpublic officers.\u201d In Section 1101.1 of the Act, the General Assembly explicitly set forth its \u201cpurpose\u201d as follows:\n(a) Declarations. \u2014 The Legislature hereby declares that public office is a public trust and that any effort to realize personal financial gain through public office other than compensation provided by law is a violation of that trust. In order to strengthen the faith and confidence of the people of this Commonwealth in their government, the Legislature further declares that the people have a right to be assured that the financial interests of holders of or nominees or candidates for public office do not conflict with the public trust. Because public confidence in government can best be sustained by assuring the people of the impartiality and honesty of public officials, this chapter shall be liberally construed to promote complete financial disclosure as specified in this chapter. Furthermore, it is recognized that clear guidelines are needed in order to guide public officials and employees in their actions. Thus, the General Assembly by this chapter intends to define as clearly as possible those areas which represent conflict with the public trust.\n65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101.1(a). The substantive focus of this declaration is on financial interests, and particularly, how complete disclosure of financial interests may further the \u201cpublic trust,\u201d \u201cstrengthen the faith and confidence of the people\u201d in their government, and assure the public that the \u201cfinancial interests\u201d of public officials \u201cdo not conflict with the public trust.\u201d See also Benninghoff, 852 A.2d at 1186 (\u201cThe obvious purpose of the Ethics Act is to mandate disclosure of the financial dealings of public officials.\u201d).\nSection 1102, the definitions section of the Act, defines \u201cfinancial interest\u201d as: \u201cAny financial interest in a legal entity engaged in business for profit which comprises more than 5% of the equity of the business or more than 5% of the assets of the economic interest in indebtedness.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1102. As already noted in discussing Carroll\u2019s argument, the definitions section also defines the term \u201cbusiness\u201d in a way that supports a reading that it intends to cover only for-profit entities. Section 1104 then sets forth the annual \u201cstatement of financial interests\u201d filing requirement, with subsections (a) through (c) describing the obligations of \u201cpublic official or employee,\u201d \u201ccandidate,\u201d and \u201cnominee,\u201d respectively. Subsection 1104(d) then addresses the failure to file, while subsection 1104(e) provides for public inspection and copying. In every instance, the required filing is designated \u201cstatement of financial interests.\u201d Section 1105, which is entitled \u201cStatement of financial interests,\u201d then provides that the statement shall be on a form prescribed by the State Ethics Commission and sets forth what required information must be included in the statement.\nIn light of this construct, we have no difficulty in finding that the Act did not require Carroll to disclose his \u201cinterest\u201d in the non-profit Mayors Club. The Act could not be any clearer that the concern is with financial interests. Moreover, the Act\u2019s definitions of the terms \u201cfinancial interest\u201d and \u201cbusiness\u201d \u2014 definitions which, as Carroll reasonably construed them, see supra note 10, are in keeping with the purpose of the legislation announced in Section 1101.1 \u2014 support a finding that Carroll was not required to list his association with it on his Financial Statement. The Mayors Club is a non-profit corporate entity, from which Carroll receives no financial compensation. Indeed, as a financial matter, his connection with the entity is a net loss, as the Mayors Club was funded, in part, from his donated mayoral salary.\nTurning to Carroll\u2019s uncompensated positions with DAMA, we will assume for purposes of decision that these positions are indeed \u201cpublic positions\u201d for purposes of subsection 1105(b)(1) but, like Carroll\u2019s association with the Mayors Club, we conclude that disclosure was not required because the association did not remotely implicate Carroll\u2019s financial interests. Viewed in isolation, subsection (1) is unlike the other subsections in 1105(b) in that it does not address matters that necessarily involve financial information. Instead, the subsection concerns what amounts to the filer\u2019s identifying information: i.e., his \u201cname, address and public position.\u201d This information reveals who it is that is filing and why. It is important to remember that the Act, and the Commission\u2019s form, governs a wide variety of people in public service, people who may have to file for different and overlapping reasons. Some file as incumbent office holders; some as incumbents seeking reelection; some as new candidates for office; some as long-term public employees seeking no office. In any given year, only a small percentage of Ethics Act filers are then actively seeking public office. Most filers are public employees who must detail their financial interests year after year, as the public trust does not go on holiday. Finally, some filers, like Carroll, must file for multiple reasons, i.e., both because of positions currently held as well as an elected position actively being sought.\nFor purposes of the Act\u2019s fatal defect rule \u2014 a rule which applies only to the extent that a filer is filing as a \u201ccandidate\u201d for office, \u00absee 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1104(b) \u2014 we do not think that the directive that candidates list their \u201cpublic position\u201d (notably, the General Assembly employed the singular) can be viewed in splendid isolation from the rest of the Act, and thus as requiring a detailing of all existing public associations, irrespective of whether they implicate a candidate\u2019s financial interests or reveal the office the candidate is seeking. A reasonable person interested in seeking public office who consulted the statute, the Commission\u2019s form, and its accompanying instructions \u2014 all of which speak in terms of financial interests \u2014 could reasonably understand the subsection (1) requirement to apply only to those \u201cpositions\u201d necessary to identify the candidate, the office he seeks, and his financial interests. One does not have a financial interest in uncompensated positions one undertakes as a corollary to an official public position. The fact of the matter is that not all public positions and associations implicate a candidate\u2019s financial interests, and nothing in the statute purports to require disclosure of non-financial interests, upon pain of being excluded from seeking office.\nFinally, in determining whether the General Assembly can be said to have intended the fatal defect rule to apply to the sort of \u201cnon-disclosure\u201d alleged here, we must be \u201cmindful of the general command that we presume that it \u2018does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d Koken v. Reliance Ins. Co., 893 A.2d 70, 81 (2006), quoting 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1); see also Street Road Bar & Grille, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Liquor Control Bd., 583 Pa. 72, 876 A.2d 346, 353 (2005). As part of its statement of \u201cpurpose\u201d in Section 1101.1, the General Assembly included the following \u201crecognition:\u201d\nIt is recognized that many public officials, including most local officials and members of the General Assembly, are citizen-officials who bring to their public office the knowledge and concerns of ordinary citizens and taxpayers. They should not be discouraged from maintaining their contacts with their community through their occupations and professions. Thus, in order to foster maximum compliance with its terms, this chapter shall be administered in a manner that emphasizes guidance to public officials and public employees regarding the ethical standards established by this chapter.\n65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101.1(b). Many candidates for public office\u2014 like many current holders of public office \u2014 have numerous public associations and positions in addition to their official, paid positions. Many of these positions do not involve a financial interest and possible concomitant \u201cviolation of the public trust.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1101.1(a). These associations simply reflect active lives of good citizenship. Upon reading the Act as a whole, and with an eye to its obvious, salutary purpose, we do not believe that the General Assembly remotely intended the disproportionate consequence of denying a candidate the right to run for office to attend a failure to disclose a public \u201cposition\u201d which does not involve the candidate\u2019s financial interests.\nFor these reasons, we hold that the court below erred in finding that Carroll\u2019s Statement of Financial Interests was fatally defective and in granting Garvey\u2019s petition to set aside Carroll\u2019s nomination petition. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and direct that Carroll\u2019s name be restored to the primary ballot.\nChief Justice CAPPY, Justice NEWMAN and Justices SAYLOR and EAKIN join this opinion.\nJustice BAER files a dissenting opinion which is joined by Justice BALDWIN.\n. Garvey's petition was filed in the Commonwealth Court's original jurisdiction, pursuant to Section 764(2) of the Judicial Code. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 764(2). This Court\u2019s direct appeal jurisdiction over Carroll\u2019s appeal is pursuant to Section 723(a) of the Code. Id. \u00a7 723(a).\n. Subsection 1104(b)(2) governs candidates for county or local office and thus is not relevant here.\n. The State Ethics Commission's instructions provide, with respect to Block 4:\nPlease check the appropriate block (seeking, holding, held) for each position you list in the blocks below. List all of the public position(s) which you are seeking, currently hold or have held in the prior calendar year. Please be sure to include job titles and official titles such as \"member\u201d or \"commissioner\u201d (even if serving as alternate/designee).\n. In Block 5, Carroll further identified these public positions, as required.\n. The Ethics Commission's instructions for Block 13 provide:\nOFFICE, DIRECTORSHIP OR EMPLOYMENT IN ANY BUSINESS ENTITY: List your office, directorship or employment in any business. If you do not have such a position to report, then check \u201cNONE\u201d.\n. In his petition to set aside, Garvey also alleged that Carroll failed to list, as a direct or indirect source of yearly income totaling $1300 or more, see 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1105(b)(5), his part-time position as a police officer with the Dallas Township Police Department. Garvey withdrew this claim at the hearing after the parties stipulated that Carroll only received $1268 in income from this employment in 2005. N.T. 3/20/06, 3-4.\n. Citing In re Petition of Cioppa, 533 Pa. 564, 626 A.2d 146, 149 (1993).\n. Citing Anastasio, supra.\n. Citing In the Matter of Nomination Petition of Wilson, 728 A.2d 1025 (Pa. Cmwlth. 1999).\n. We recognize that there are two possible constructions of the \"organized for profit\u201d reference in the Act's definition of \"business,\u201d one which would construe the reference as modifying all previous examples in the definition (which is flow Carroll reads the statute), and one which would construe it as applying only to the last antecedent example. See, e.g., McKinley v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Dept. of Transp., 564 Pa. 565, 769 A.2d 1153, 1160 n. 10 (2001) (discussing \"last antecedent rule\u201d of grammatical construction). To the extent the definitional language is ambiguous, we may look to principles of construction. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b); Canvass of Absentee Ballots, supra. For reasons set forth at greater length below, the plainly-stated purpose of the statute, and the harsh consequence that would accompany a construction that would lead to a finding of a material non-disclosure, convince us that any ambiguity in the definition should be construed most favorably to candidates seeking ballot access.\n. Section 1105(a) & (b) provide in full:\n(a) Form. \u2014 The statement of financial interests filed pursuant to this chapter shall be on a form prescribed by the commission. All information requested on the statement shall be provided to the best of the knowledge, information and belief of the person required to file and shall be signed under oath or equivalent affirmation.\n(b) Required information. \u2014 'flic statement shall include the following information for the prior calendar year with regard to the person required to file the statement:\n(1) Name, address and public position.\n(2) Occupation or profession.\n(3) Any direct or indirect interest in any real estate which was sold or leased to the Commonwealth, any of its agencies or political subdivisions, or purchased [ ] or leased from the Commonwealth, any of its agencies or political subdivisions, or which was the subject of any condemnation proceedings by the Commonwealth, any of its agencies or political subdivisions.\n(4) The name and address of each creditor to whom is owed in excess of $6,500 and the interest rate thereon. However, loans or credit extended between members of the immediate family and mortgages securing real property which is the principal or secondary residence of the person filing shall not be included.\n(5) The name and address of any direct or indirect source of income totaling in the aggregate $1,300 or more. However, this provision shall not be construed to require the divulgence of confidential information protected by statute or existing professional codes of ethics or common law privileges.\n(6) The name and address of the source and the amount of any gift or gifts valued in the aggregate at $250 or more and the circumstances of each gift. This paragraph shall not apply to a gift or gifts received from a spouse, parent, parent by marriage, sibling, child, grandchild, other family member or friend when the circumstances make it clear that the motivation for the action was a personal or family relationship. However, for the purposes of this paragraph, the term \"friend\u201d shall not include a registered lobbyist or an employee of a registered lobbyist.\n(7) The name and address of the source and the amount of any payment for or reimbursement of actual expenses for transportation and lodging or hospitality received in connection with public office or employment where such actual expenses for transportation and lodging or hospitality exceed $650 in the course of a single occurrence. This paragraph shall not apply to expenses reimbursed by a governmental body or to expenses reimbursed by an organization or association of public officials or employees of political subdivisions which the public official or employee serves in an official capacity.\n(8) Any office, directorship or employment of any nature whatsoever in any business entity.\n(9) Any financial interest in any legal entity engaged in business for profit.\n(10) The identity of any financial interest in a business with which the reporting person is or has been associated in the preceding calendar year which has been transferred to a member of the reporting person\u2019s immediate family.\nId. (footnote omitted).\n. See 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1104 (requiring public officials, public employees, and candidates for state-level, county-level, and local-level public office to file Statement of Financial Interests).\n. Notably, Carroll testified that he did not report the disputed associations because, inter alia, he received no compensation from them.\n. In light of our disposition, we do not address the alternative arguments Carroll has forwarded in support of reversal."}
