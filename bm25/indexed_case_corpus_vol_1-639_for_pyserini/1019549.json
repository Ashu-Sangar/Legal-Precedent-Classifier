{"id": "1019549", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe correct conclusion of the learned court below was that under Kountz\u2019s Est. (No. 1), 213 Pa. 390, the deed of trust executed by Peninah W. Kountz on January 8, 1898, offended the rule against perpetuities and was therefore void. What was said by Mr. Justice Potter in that case of the will of the testatrix applies with equal force to her said deed.\nAppeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
