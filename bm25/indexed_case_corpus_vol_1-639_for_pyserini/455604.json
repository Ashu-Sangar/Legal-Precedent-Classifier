Westmoreland Coal Company\u2019s Appeal, 4 Norris, 344, and cases there cited. The will of the testatrix, which we are called upon to construe, expressly authorized the trustees therein named if they deemed it proper, to \u201clease the Newport farm for coal mining purposes.\u201d In the exercise of that discretion the trustees did lease and are receiving the rents, income and profits therefrom. The testatrix devised to the trustees \u201c all the rest, residue and remainder of her estate, real, personal and mixed,\u201d which included the Newport farm, in trust for \u201cthe use, property and benefit\u201d of her grandson. The trustees to apply \u201cthe annual income and proceeds thereof\u201d to his support, maintenance and advancement until he should arrive at the age of twenty-two years, and thereafter to pay over to him \u201cthe hnnual income and proceeds of any accumulations thereof yearly during his natural life,\u201d remainder over. We think the authority to lease the land for coal mining purposes, indicates very clearly an intent of the testatrix to make the proceeds a part of the annual income to be paid over to her grandson as the life tenant. It follows the court was correct in the conclusion at which it arrived. The assignments are not sustained.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants, to be paid out of trust funds."}
