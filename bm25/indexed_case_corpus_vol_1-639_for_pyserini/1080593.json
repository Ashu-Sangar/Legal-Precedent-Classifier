{"id": "1080593", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Moschzisker,\nIn this equitable proceeding to obtain a conveyance of four tracts of land described in a written agreement between tbe parties to tbe suit, tbe court below, sustaining a demurrer, beld the contract so indefinite regarding tbe property to be conveyed as to prevent a decree of specific performance against defendants; plaintiffs have appealed.\nTbe particular provision wbicb gives rise to tbe controversy is as follows: \u201cTbe premises are to be conveyed clear of all encumbrances or easements or other obligations to tbe title except a life interest to be excepted and reserved by tbe parties of tbe first part [vendors in tbe agreement, and defendants here] in the bouse wbicb they now occupy and one-balf acre of tillable ground for raising garden truck, wbicb plot of ground will be later designated by tbe parties hereto.\u201d\nIn sustaining tbe demurrer, tbe court said: \u201cIt is apparent tbe one-balf acre so to be excepted from tbe four tracts of land has never been designated or located by tbe parties to tbe contract. Neither is there any averment that plaintiffs have requested defendants to agree upon tbe location thereof, nor that plaintiffs, before tbe filing of their bill of complaint, offered to accept such location of tbe reservation as defendants might designate. Looking only at plaintiffs\u2019 bill, it does not appear that either plaintiffs or defendants have made any attempt to agree upon a location of this reservation, although tbe contract specifically states that such reservation \u2018will be later designated by the parties hereto.\u2019 In other words, as tbe case now stands, both parties have neglected to designate, or to attempt to designate, tbe location of tbe reservation, [and] without such location......it would be impossible to execute and deliver a deed in accordance with tbe terms of tbe contract.......\u2018A chancellor can only enforce an agreement specifically where tbe parties have agreed definitely on all its terms and left nothing to the future but mere performance\u2019 : Agnew v. Southern A. L. Co., 204 Pa. 192.\u201d In this we see no error.-\nWhile here the uncertainty of description concerns what is reserved out of the tracts of land to be conveyed, it is, nevertheless, apparent that if, from a definite whole, an indefinite part is excepted, necessarily the remainder is rendered so uncertain that it is impossible to order a conveyance till the indefinite part is ascertained.\nIn the case of Agnew v. Southern, supra, it was provided by the contract in suit that the size of the lot of ground purchased was to be determined thereafter, referring to a general plan \u201cto be laid out and established.\u201d Mr. Justice Mitchell said, affirming a decree dismissing the bill: \u201cThe memorandum in writing on which appellant\u2019s bill is founded is......wanting in that complete and definite character which is necessary to enable a court of equity to decree specific performance. The bill supplements the memorandum by describing the land as Tot No. 1, in a plan......\u2019 It may be conceded that if the memorandum itself had so described it, the court might have resorted to extrinsic evidence......to identify the subject-matter......The memorandum itself [however] not only fails to identify the land in question ......, but shows affirmatively that the precise...... location and boundaries of the intended purchase were left to future......determination......The definite terms of the contract were thus expressly left for the future actions of the parties......A chancellor can only enforce an agreement specifically where the parties have agreed definitely on all its terms and left nothing to the future but bare performance.\u201d This language well applies to the case at bar.\nIn the instant case there is to be \u201cexcepted and reserved\u201d from the deed of conveyance a life estate by the vendors (defendants) \u201cin the house which they now occupy,\u201d and the same estate in \u201cone-half acre of tillable ground,\u201d it being expressly provided by the contract that this \u201cplot of ground will be later designated by the parties hereto.\u201d The parties having thus expressly agreed how the portion reserved out of the conveyance should be determined and \u201cdesignated,\u201d neither the separate selection of the vendors or vendees nor the judgment of the chancellor can be substituted without making a new contract for them. Perhaps the \u201chouse which they [the vendors] now occupy\u201d might be located by parol (O\u2019Connell v. Cease, 267 Pa. 288), on the theory of locating a subject-matter sufficiently described to satisfy the statute of frauds, but not so the half-acre of ground, the designation of which was expressly left to future joint action of the parties.\nUnder the express terms of the present agreement, the reservation is so connected with acts yet to be performed by the contracting parties, in order to determine and adequately describe the property involved, that there can be no application of the rule which appellants claim should control this case, namely, \u201cIf the description of the exception is void for uncertainty, the title for the whole tract passes......(8 R. C. L. 1097; 18 Corp. Juris 344, 348).\u201d As correctly said in the work last above cited (18 C. J. 348), uncertainty of description does not render a reservation void where there is a method provided in the deed \u201cwhereby it can be made sufficiently certain.\u201d\nFinally, we cannot hold, as appellants would have us do, that \u201cit was the intention of the parties to reserve the right to designate the one-half acre of ground after the delivery of the deed\u201d; the plain words of their contract, quoted at the beginning of this opinion, forbid such construction.\nWe have examined the numerous authorities cited; those controlling us are not at variance with the views here expressed, nor with the ultimate conclusion reached by the court below, and those from other jurisdictions are distinguishable on their facts.\nThe assignments of error are overruled and the decree is affirmed at cost of appellants."}
