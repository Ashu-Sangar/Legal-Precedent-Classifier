{"id": "1237106", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Chidsey,\nPlaintiff, Vincent A. Capozi, brought an action in trespass against Hearst Publishing Company, Inc., and Jacob Wilder to recover damages for personal injuries resulting from the latter\u2019s negligent driving of a truck. The Hearst Publishing Company filed an answer denying any agency relationship between itself and the individual defendant. A jury rendered a verdict of $80,-000 against both defendants. The defendants together filed motion for new trial and defendant, Hearst Publishing Company, separately filed motion for judgment in its favor non obstante veredicto..\n\u25a0 Prior to argument on these motions, defendants petitioned for and the court issued' a rul\u00e9 upon plaintiff to show cause--why he should not . carry out the terms of an alleged agreement-of settlement made by counsel for the parties prior to the verdict, or suffer a decree against him for $22,500 (the claimed amount of settlement) and record costs in satisfaction of his cause of action. The plaintiff filed an answer to this petition and rule, and depositions were taken. The lower court in its opinion dismissing the motions for new trial and judgment non obstante veredicto, with reference to the rule issued said that \u201c. . . the case was apparently settled as far as counsel was concerned, but there is no evidence that the plaintiff agreed to anything his counsel said, and the plaintiff had a contract with his attorney whereby the case could not be settled without the permission of the plaintiff. Therefore, we believe this case was properly submitted to the jury, . . .\u201d. As it appeared that the court intended to and in effect did discharge the rule, the parties stipulated that the appeal to this Court should be argued and decided as if an order had been entered expressly discharging the rule. The dismissal of the defendants\u2019 motion for' new trial was conditioned upon remittitur being filed for all of the verdict in excess of $40,000.' ' This remittitur was filed and judgment was entered against both defendants in the amount of $40,000. On this appeal' therefrom defendants make various contentions.\nWe shall first consider the claim by both defendants that the alleged settlement agreement was binding upon the plaintiff. Under the rule issued, depositions were taken of the plaintiff, counsel for plain-biff, counsel for the defendants and the representative of defendants\u2019 insurance carrier, and the contract between plaintiff and his attorneys was introduced which contained - a provision \u201cSaid attorneys shall have full power to settle or .compromise said suit or suits as may- appear to them to my best interest-, \u2022 but, in \u2022 no event, for a- sum-less-than that expressly approved- by me; . . .\u201d. Negotiations for settlement of the case had been carried on for several weeks, prior to and during the course of the trial. They appeared to have culminated in what occurred in the trial judge\u2019s chambers when counsel for both parties met there with the trial judge. As indicated in the finding contained in the lower court\u2019s opinion, above quoted, there appeared to have been an agreement between counsel for settlement of the case at $22,500, and the real question at issue was whether plaintiff\u2019s counsel were authorized to agree to a settlement in such amount. Appellants make no claim of ratification by plaintiff of his attorneys\u2019 act as in Yarnall v. Yorkshire Worsted Mills, 370 Pa. 93, 87 A. 2d 192.\nIn their brief appellants state, \u201cWe do not question the well established principle that an attorney\u2019s mere status as attorney in the case does not vest him with authority to settle his client\u2019s case without his client\u2019s consent. We submit, however, that there is sufficient evidence in the record to justify the conclusion that the plaintiff himself had authorized his attorney to settle the case for $22,500.00.\u201d\nIn their depositions, the plaintiff and his attorneys denied that authority was given. Appellants review the testimony and forcibly argue that the actions of plaintiff and his attorneys throughout the extended negotiations contradict their assertions in this regard. However, there was competent evidence to support the finding of the court below that there was no settlement of the case binding upon or enforceable against the plaintiff, and we cannot say that the court below abused its discretion in arriving at such conclusion.\nDefendant IXearsh Publishing Company contends that judgment non obstante veredicto in its favor should have been granted because of the failure of plaintiff to prove the existence of a master-servant relationship between it and the individual defendant. In support of this contention the publishing company first claims that there was no evidence introduced to connect it with any of the events or personalities involved in the accident. The truck which ran into plaintiff was driven by the defendant Wilder and was being used for distribution of a newspaper daily, the \u201cPittsburgh Sun-Telegraph\u201d. Although the named defendant was Hearst Publishing Company, Inc., the case was tried on the theory or assumption that the \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d, or \u201cSun-Tele\u201d as it is popularly known, was the co-defendant with Wilder. Throughout the testimony bearing upon Wilder\u2019s status either as an independent contractor or employe of his codefendant, the latter was invariably referred to as \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d. The court in its charge referred to the \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d as the defendant, at one time stating to the jury: \u201cNow, then, the defendant says \u2014 they have two different defenses. The Sun-Telegraph, which is owned by the Hearst papers, says this man. was not their employee and, therefore, \u2018We are not responsible for his negligence. He was an independent contractor.\u2019 \u201d, and instructed the jury: \u201cYou can bring them [verdicts] in against Mr. Wilder and the Sun-Tele or you can bring it in against either of them, and I think it would be foolish to bring it in against the Sun-Tele if you do not bring it in against Wilder.\u201d The trial judge at the conclusion of his charge said: \u201cIs there anything else that either side would like me to charge on?\u201d. Various requests were then made in which the corporate defendant was referred to by counsel on both sides as \u201cSun-Tele\u201d or \u201cthe newspaper\u201d. At no time did counsel for the defendant Hearst Publishing Company seek any correction by the court in its charge in this respect, and although he moved for a compulsory non-suit as to the corporate defendant and filed a point for binding instructions in its favor, in neither case was it placed upon the ground that no testimony had been adduced involving the Hearst Publishing Company.\nDefendants\u2019 counsel proceeded throughout the trial as if \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d or \u201cSun-Tele\u201d and the named defendant, Hearst Publishing Company, were synonymous or identical, acquiesced in the lower court\u2019s similar treatment of the corporate defendant, and it would be unfair and unjust under the circumstances to now permit reliance upon this misnomer to which defendant throughout the trial subscribed. Cf. Skocich et al. v. F. J. Boutell Driveaway Company, 317 Pa. 26, 176 A. 19.\nWe turn to the more substantial argument in support of the contention now being considered: Should the jury have been permitted to find the existence of a master-servant relationship between the two defendants? In order to connect and impose liability upon the corporate defendant, plaintiff relied in the presentation of his case upon the presumption of ownership and agency arising out of the display of a defendant\u2019s name upon a business truck: Hartig v. American Ice Co., 290 Pa. 21, 137 A. 867. The plaintiff\u2019s case established that the truck which ran into plaintiff and driven by Wilder, had the words \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d in large letters on both of its sides. The words were not permanently painted thereon but appeared on posters that were pasted on the sides of the truck, and there was testimony that in addition to the words \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d the posters served to advertise articles that would appear in current or future editions of the paper. Appellants argue that the presumption as to ownership and agency applies where the name of the defendant is permanently painted on the truck, but that there is no reasonable basis for inferring that a vehicle is owned or used in the business of one whose product is advertised on the vehicle; that it is common knowledge that certain companies utilize their vehicles to advertise the products of other companies. We can see no substantial difference in the applicability of the presumption in question, between a name painted on a truck or printed on a poster attached to the truck if it so predominates in the sight of the passing public to reasonably permit the inference of agency and ownership. A poster may well be used to not only denote proprietorship but to permit change in the advertisement of the proprietor\u2019s own product.\nThe defendant Wilder testified that the posters, which were 6 feet by 3 feet in size, were put on every week by an employe of the \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d. The testimony clearly indicated that the words \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d predominated in the printed matter so as to catch the eye. One witness testified that he saw the trucks every day and that they had the words \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d on them. He further testified that the posters covered the whole side of the truck. Another witness said the truck had big letters \u201cSun-Tele\u201d on the side. A reading of their testimony shows that although the trucks had other words advertising specific articles and features in the \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d, the focus of attention to all were the words \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d.\nUnquestionably the outstanding and distinctive words were \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d which characterized the corporate defendant\u2019s business or trade name: (See Vance et al. v. The Freedom Oil Works Company, 113 Pa. Superior Ct. 280, 173 A. 496). We are of the opinion that the evidence here sufficiently justified the presumption that the truck belonged to the defendant and was being used in its business.\nIn Sefton v. Valley Dairy Company, 345 Pa. 324, 28 A. 2d 313, we said at p. 326: \u201cIt is well settled by our previous decisions that the presence of a defendant\u2019s name on a commercial vehicle raises a rebuttable presumption that the vehicle is owned by defendant and that the driver of the vehicle is a servant of defendant acting within the scope of his employment: Williams v. Ludwig Floral Co., 252 Pa. 140, 97 A. 206; Holzheimer v. Lit Bros., 262 Pa. 150, 105 A. 73; Sieber v. Russ Bros. Ice Cream Co., 276 Pa. 340, 120 A. 272; Hartig v. American Ice Co., 290 Pa. 21, 137 A. 867; Talarico v. Baker Office Furn. Co., 298 Pa. 211, 149 A. 883. This presumption is sufficient to take the case to the jury even though defendant produces uncontradicted evidence that the driver was not its employee (Holzheimer v. Lit Bros., supra), or produces evidence that it did not own the vehicle in question (Hartig v. American Ice Co., supra). The rule is thus stated in the Sartig case: \u2018Where the evidence produced by plaintiff, if believed, is sufficient to prove that he was injured by the negligence of one in charge of a business automobile, bearing the trade name of defendant, displayed thereon in such a manner as trade or business names are usually placed on vehicles used for trade or business purposes, these facts are sufficient (1) to raise the presumption that the car in question was owned by defendant and was being used by the person in charge thereof for defendant\u2019s business purposes: and (2), when such presumptions so arise, they entitle plaintiff to have his case submitted to the jury.\u2019 \u201d.\nThe defendant Wilder testified that lie ivas tbe owner of tbe truck, but this did not overcome tbe presumption : Hartig v. American Ice Company, supra. It may be added that tbe defendant Wilder not only testified that the truck carried tbe words \u201cSun-Telegraph\u201d on its sides but tbe import of bis testimony is that tbe truck was used for tbe distribution of tbe newspaper and apparently for no other purpose. This was additional evidence in support of the presumption that it was being used in tbe corporate defendant\u2019s business. There was other testimony bearing on tbe relationship between Wilder and tbe corporate defendant, some indicating that tbe former was an employe and other that be was an independent contractor, but under all tbe evidence in tbe record presented, tbe question of tbe relationship was for tbe jury. And tbe plaintiff in opposing judgment non obstante veredicto was of course entitled to have all of the evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom considered most favorably to him.\nWe pass to tbe appellants\u2019 third contention that a written contract covering tbe relationship between tbe individua] and the corporate defendant was improperly excluded from evidence. Tlie defendant Wilder testified tliat he was the owner of the truck which he was operating at the time of the accident and that there was a contract covering the use of the truck which he identified. He was asked \u201cUnder the terms of this contract, Mr. Wilder, what was your status with the SunTele?\u201d. Counsel for the plaintiff objected: \u201c. . . because the contract speaks for itself. It is the best evidence, if that is tlxe contract.\u201d Counsel for the defendants then offered the contract in evidence with the provision that \u201c. . . that portion of the contract which refers to public liability insurance be kept from the jury\u2019s knowledge.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the offer unless the contract was offered as a whole. The court ruled that the contract must be offered in its entirety and rejected the offer. Counsel excepted to the ruling.\nThe provision referring to public liability insurance appears in paragraph 3 and is as follows: \u201cThe Owner agrees to procure and maintain, during the term of this agreement, $10,000-$2Q,0QQ Public Liability Insurance and $5,000 Property Damage Insurance, which insurance shall be in a recognized stock company and, in addition to protecting the Owner, shall protect, indemnify and save harmless the Company from any and all liability by reason of any accidents or injuries of any kind which may result from the operation or use of said truck. The Company shall be named in the insurance policy as one of the parties insured and said policy or a certificate thereof shall be delivered to the Company upon a receipt being given to the Owner for the same. . . .\u201d. The contract was unquestionably of evidential importance in establishing the legal relationship between the individual defendant and the corporate defendant. A cursory inspection of the instrument clearly indicates that under its terms Wilder acted as an independent contractor and not as an employe of the corporate defendant in the use of the truck. If offered in its entirety it was clearly relevant. The sole question, therefore, is whether it was properly receivable in evidence with the exclusion of the above portion relating to insurance.\nSeveral applicable principles of law are apparent. First, the fact that a defendant in an action for personal injuries is insured against liability is usually irrelevant and prejudicial: Kaplan et al. v. Loev, 327 Pa. 465, 194 A. 653; secondly, that if such information becomes relevant it is under certain circumstances admissible despite its prejudicial effect: Lenahan v. Pittston Coal Mining Company, 221 Pa. 626, 70 A. 884; Jury v. New York Central Railroad Company, 167 Pa. Superior Ct. 244, 74 A. 2d 531; thirdly, as a general rule a party may not offer in evidence the portions of a document which are beneficial to his case and withhold the harmful portion but must instead offer the document in its entirety: Cary v. Cary, 189 Pa. 65, 42 A. 19; fourthly, there are exceptions to the rule that the whole document must be offered: Beaver Trust Co., Guardian v. Kertis, Intervenor, 298 Pa. 322, 148 A. 471; Baldi v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 213.\nIn our consideration of .this phase of the appeal, we have, found no case with substantially similar facts, nor any authority ruling the precise question presented. However, we are convinced that an application of the principles above enunciated makes it clear that the court below committed reversible error. In the present case the document was offered in support of the contention that the individual defendant was an independent contractor. The provision as to insurance was completely consonant with the contention of the defendant Hearst and in no manner could aid plaintiff\u2019s contention that the driver was the employe of defendant Hearst. Thus the only 'possible purpose its receipt in evidence could serve, from plaintiff\u2019s viewpoint, would be to reveal to the jury the existence of insurance. The general rule that a document must be. offered in its entirety does not, in our.-.-opinion,-apply, to a document otherwise admissible which contains matter that is highly prejudicial, and therefore of itself inadmissible, unless the exclusion of the latter adversely affects the party insisting upon the introduction of the document in its entirety.\nCounsel for plaintiff relies upon cases where it has been held discretionary with the court as to what documentary evidence should go out with the jury and endeavors to similarize the present situation because of the language employed by counsel for the appellants at the time of the offer. It is sufficient answer to say that the offer in substance was the introduction of the contract into evidence without the provision with respect to public liability insurance. The objection by counsel for plaintiff was in substance to the introduction of less than the entire contract and the court\u2019s ruling was with respect to the contract\u2019s introduction into evidence. No discretion was involved in this situation. The exclusion of the prejudicial portion of the contract was a matter of right. The refusal of the admission of the document into evidence with the exclusion was harmful error.\nSince a new trial must be granted and the verdict therefore set aside, it is unnecessary to consider appellants\u2019 remaining contention that the verdict as reduced was still excessive.\nJudgment is reversed and a venire facias de novo, is awarded.\nIt is not contended or suggested that the \u201cPittsburgh Sun-Telegraph\u201d is a separate corporate entity. During the trial appellant offered in evidence a written contract between Wilder and \u201cPittsburgh Sun-Telegraph, Department of Hearst Punishing Company, Inc.\u201d. (Emphasis supplied) The rejection of this offer is discussed infra.\n\u201c(% Ton Truck)\nAGREEMENT\nThis Agreement is made and entered into this 5th day of January, 1943 by and between Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph, Department of Hearst Publishing Co., Inc., party of the first part (hereinafter called the \u2018Company\u2019), and Jacob Wilder residing at 149 Jucunda Street, Pittsburgh 10, Pennsylvania, party of the second part (hereinafter called the \u2018Owner\u2019).\nWITNESSETH: '\nWhereas; the Owner is' engaged in the trucking, and hauling business and is. the \"owner .of automotive equipment'suitable for those purposes .which he desires to operate in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and vicinity, fox ,the transportation of.

If the Company specifies a one-half ton truck and the Owner furnishes a one ton truck the Company agrees to pay for the transportation furnished at the rate of hire as set forth in Section 5 hereof. If, however, the Company specifies that the Owner shall replace his present truck with a one ton truck and the Owner does acquire and furnish a one ton truck the Company agrees to pay the Owner for a transportation week of seven (7) days One Hundred Twenty-Two dollars and Sixty cents (\u00a7122.60) instead of One Hundred Fifteen dollars and Ten cents ($115.10) as set forth in Section 5, hereof, it being understood and agreed that all other provisions of this agreement, except the increase of Seven dollars and Fifty cents ($7.50) shall remain unchanged.\n9.
