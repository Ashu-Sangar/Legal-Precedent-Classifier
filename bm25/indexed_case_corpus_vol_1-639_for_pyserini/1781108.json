{"id": "1781108", "contents": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nIn this direct appeal from his judgments of sentence, appellant raises two issues: 1) the evidence presented at trial by the Commonwealth was insufficient to support his conviction for voluntary manslaughter; and 2) a guilty verdict of voluntary manslaughter is inconsistent with a guilty verdict of involuntary manslaughter. We have reviewed the record and find these contentions to be without merit.\nAccordingly, the judgments of sentence are affirmed.\nNIX, J., files a concurring opinion."}
