{"id": "941805", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe principle volenti non fit injuria is a good defense to what would otherwise be actual fraud: Zuver v. Clark, 104 Pa. 222, and a fortiori it is good against merely constructive fraud. The jury have found that plaintiff knew and assented to the conveyance by defendant to the latter\u2019s wife. That ended the plaintiff\u2019s case.\nAn attorney at law who acts for both parties in negotiations or communications in presence of both is a competent witness for either as to such matters: Goodwin Gas Stove & Meter Co.\u2019s Appeal, 117 Pa. 514.\nJudgment affirmed."}
