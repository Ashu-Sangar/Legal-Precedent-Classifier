In his will, Mr. duPont created in Mrs. Rust a special testamentary power of appointment over the one-third share of the residue. The will provides that Fidelity-Philadelphia is\n\u201cupon her death to transfer, assign, and pay over the principal of her share of [Mr. duPont\u2019s] residuary estate unto such of her children and issue of deceased children, and in such proportions as she may by her Last Will and Testament or any writing in the nature thereof direct, limit and appoint\u201d (emphasis added).\nMrs. Rust died in 1975. In her will, Mrs. Rust appointed a part of this share to appellants William Shore, Harry Devine, and Girard Trust Bank in trust for the benefit of her surviving daughter Carroll (Mr. duPont\u2019s granddaughter) for life and then for the benefit of the issue of Carroll (Mr. duPont\u2019s great grandchildren). Mrs. Rust gave appellants the discretion to make periodic payments from principal to Carroll\u2019s issue.\nUpon Mrs. Rust\u2019s death, Fidelity-Philadelphia filed an account in the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County. The auditing judge reviewed the objection to Mrs. Rust\u2019s exercise of her special power of appointment and concluded that Mrs. Rust exceeded the bounds of her special power by appointing part of the residue for the benefit of the issue of Mrs. Rust\u2019s surviving daughter Carroll. Objections to the adjudication of the auditing judge were dismissed by the orphans\u2019 court. In this appeal, appellants contend that Mr. duPont authorized Mrs. Rust to appoint to Carroll\u2019s issue while Carroll is still living. We do not agree. We agree with the holding of the orphans\u2019 court that Mrs. Rust exceeded her special power and therefore affirm.\nThe orphans\u2019 court interpreted \u201cchildren and issue of deceased children\u201d to include those persons who are either living \u201cchildren\u201d of Mrs. Rust or \u201cissue of deceased children\u201d of Mrs. Rust at the time of her death. The court concluded that the potential beneficiaries of the special power are confined to those persons within the precise class defined in Mr. duPont\u2019s will, and that Mrs. Rust could not alter or expand that group. Hence, the court held invalid the appointment in trust for the benefit of the issue of Mrs. Rust\u2019s surviving daughter Carroll because Carroll\u2019s issue were not \u201cissue of deceased children\u201d of Mrs. Rust at Mrs. Rust\u2019s death.\n\u201cThe donee of a power is simply a trustee for the donor to carry into effect the authority conferred by the power. In exercising the power, he must observe strictly its provisions and limitations.\u201d Rogers\u2019 Estate, 218 Pa. 431, 433, 67 A. 762, 762 (1907); Schede Estate, 426 Pa. 93, 231 A.2d 135 (1967). For her exercise of the special power to be effective, Mrs. Rust had to exercise that power within the limits of her authority. Schede Estate, supra; Restatement of Property \u00a7 351 (1940); V American Law of Property \u00a7 23.52 (Casner ed. 1952).\nTo validate Mrs. Rust\u2019s appointment to Mr. duPont\u2019s great grandchildren while their mother Carroll is still living would be to ignore the express language of Mr. duPont\u2019s will. Mr. duPont\u2019s testamentary plan is explicit: the language \u201cchildren and issue of deceased children\u201d gives Mrs. Rust the power to benefit her living \u201cchildren\u201d (Mr. duPont\u2019s grandchildren). This language provides in the alternative that if any of those children predecease Mrs. Rust, and if those deceased children are survived by issue, those \u201cissue of deceased children\u201d (Mr. duPont\u2019s great grandchildren) should be eligible beneficiaries. Such a scheme is a reasonable method of avoiding the potentially harsh exclusion of the great grandchildren of Mr. duPont whose parent happened to predecease Mrs. Rust. By including \u201cissue of deceased children\u201d as permissible beneficiaries, Mr. duPont allowed Mrs. Rust to appoint to such issue in place of their parent who predeceased Mrs. Rust.\nMr. duPont, in granting Mrs. Rust the power, \u201cupon her death,\u201d to benefit \u201c[her] children and issue of [her] deceased children ... in such proportions\u201d as she should choose, decided that living children of Mrs. Rust are best qualified to see to the needs of their issue; only the issue of deceased children were to be provided for by Mrs. Rust directly. While Mr. duPont authorized Mrs. Rust to have the power to appoint \u201cin such proportions\u201d as she saw fit, he did not authorize the expansion or alteration of the class of permissible beneficiaries so as to encompass issue of living children. We find such an attempt to be in excess of the limits of Mrs. Rust\u2019s powers and therefore hold it invalid.\nMrs. Rust attempted to circumvent Mr. duPont\u2019s limitation to appoint only to \u201cissue of deceased children\u201d by delegating to appellants the authority to make appointments from principal to Carroll\u2019s issue after Carroll\u2019s death. Mrs. Rust authorized appellants to exercise at Carroll\u2019s death the discretion of Mr. duPont conferred exclusively upon Mrs. Rust to decide how the principal should be apportioned among members of the class of beneficiaries. However, Mr. duPont authorized Mrs. Rust to appoint \u201cby her Last Will and Testament or any writing in the nature thereof.\u201d This language reflects an intent that Mrs. Rust exercise her appointment power at the time of her death. The testamentary nature of her special power is inconsistent with her attempt to postpone the choice of beneficiaries beyond the time of her death.\nAppellants, at oral argument, contended that the decision of the orphans\u2019 court will burden Carroll\u2019s issue with harsh tax consequences. That concern does not relieve a court from the duty of discerning the testator\u2019s intent as it is expressed in the will and the overall testamentary plan.\n\u201cAs to the obviation of taxes, it is incontestable that almost every settlor and testator desires to minimize his tax burden to the greatest extent possible. However, courts cannot be placed in the position of estate planners, charged with the task of reinterpreting deeds of trust and testamentary dispositions so as to generate the most favorable possible tax consequences for the estate. Rather courts are obliged to construe the settlor\u2019s or testator\u2019s intent as evidenced by the language of the instrument itself, the overall scheme of distributions, and the surrounding circumstances.\u201d\nEstate of Benson, 447 Pa. 62, 72, 285 A.2d 101, 106 (1971).
