{"id": "1722074", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPOMEROY, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the trial court denying appellant relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act following an evidentiary hearing ordered by this Court. See Commonwealth v. Wilder, 461 Pa. 597, 337 A.2d 564 (1975).\nIn his first appeal to this Court, Wilder contended, inter alia, that he had been denied his right to confront Harold DeWolf, the victim of the robbery-murder with which Wilder was charged, after he had been shot and before he died. (DeWolf was immediately hospitalized after the robbery, during which he was shot twice in the abdomen; he survived for twenty-four days thereafter.) We determined that appellant was entitled to such a confrontation absent \u201cexceptional and compelling reasons,\u201d such as the victim\u2019s physical or mental condition. Id. at 604, 337 A.2d at 568. Because the record before us at that time did not contain any evidence of the victim\u2019s condition, we remanded the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to ascertain whether his condition \u201ccould justify the authorities\u2019 failure to afford appellant confrontation.\u201d Id.\nPursuant to our order of remand, the court below held a hearing at which testimony was taken of Dr. Daniel Brooks, the victim\u2019s physician during the period in question. Based upon his testimony and the hospital\u2019s medical records relative to DeWolf, which were received into evidence, the court found as \u201cfacts that Harold DeWolf was both mentally and physically unable to cooperate, and further, that any attempt to force confrontation upon him would have been both unreliable and dangerous in its effect.\u201d\nIn Commonwealth v. Minnick, 432 Pa. 462, 464, 247 A.2d 569, 571 (1968), we stated that findings of fact by the trial judge in a hearing under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act \u201cif supported by evidence in the record may not be overturned.\u201d See also Commonwealth v. Wright, 232 Pa.Super. 470, 334 A.2d 766 (1975). Having reviewed the record, we find ample evidence to support the court\u2019s findings.\nOrder affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., concurs in the result.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, \u00a7 1 et seq., 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-1 et seq. (Supp.1976-77).\n. The hearing was conducted by Administrative Judge Samuel Strauss and Judge Loran L. Lewis jointly. They later filed a joint opinion in support of their order denying post-conviction relief.\n. Appellant asks us to reject those findings because of alleged conflicts between Dr. Brooks\u2019s testimony at the hearing and the contemporaneous description of the victim\u2019s condition as contained in the medical records. Assuming such conflicts exist, they were for the fact-finder and not this Court to resolve. Commonwealth v. Agie, 449 Pa. 187, 296 A.2d 741 (1972).\n. In addition to the issue of the victim\u2019s condition, appellant in his brief also raises the question whether he had been denied a fair trial by reason of the Commonwealth\u2019s suppression of an oral statement made by the victim which was allegedly exculpatory of the appellant. This issue has been raised for the first time on this appeal and is clearly outside of the scope of our remand order. Accordingly, we will not consider it. Commonwealth v. McBurse, 465 Pa. 198, 348 A.2d 423 (1975)."}
