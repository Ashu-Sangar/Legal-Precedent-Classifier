{"id": "4352513", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 24th day of September, 2014, the Order of the Commonwealth Court is VACATED, and the matter is REMANDED for further proceedings.\nThe December 10,1998, sentencing order states, in relevant part, that Appellant is to undergo confinement of \u201c10 months to 60 months effective 12/13/96. This effective date includes 728 days[\u2019J credit for time served \u201d (emphasis added). The Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision to dismiss Appellant\u2019s petition rested, in material part, on its finding that the above sentencing order is ambiguous insofar as whether it \u201cintended to give [Appellant] an additional 728 days of credit or whether the trial court had included the 728 days of credit in calculating the sentence.\u201d Foley v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Corr., No. 118 M.D. 2013, slip op. at 7 n. 7, 2014 WL 1004116 (Pa.Cmwlth. Mar. 13, 2014). That determination of ambiguity formed the basis for the court\u2019s conclusion that the sentencing judge had merely clarified the order in response to an inquiry from the Department of Corrections.\nThe underlying finding of ambiguity was error: the order clearly and unambiguously conveys that the 728 days of credit are applied to back-date the effective sentence start date to December 13, 1996. Additionally, the Commonwealth Court described the Department\u2019s September 17, 2003, letter to the sentencing court as \u201crequesting clarification of the sentencing order,\u201d id. at 3, when in fact the letter (a) opined that the court had improperly given duplicative credit, and (b) reflected an intention (unless expressly directed otherwise) to override the sentencing order by denying such credit based on the Department\u2019s interpretation of decisional law. See McCray v. DOC, 582 Pa. 440, 872 A.2d 1127, 1133 (2005) (observing that the Department is an administrative agency of the Executive Branch and, as such, is charged with faithfully executing orders imposed by the courts, and that it lacks authority to alter sentencing terms and conditions or to assess the legality of sentencing orders).\nNevertheless, it is unclear whether the dismissal of Appellant\u2019s amended petition can be supported on alternative grounds. In any event, whether the pleadings are sufficient to withstand the Department\u2019s demurrer, based on any well-pleaded allegations and the unambiguous content of the December 12, 1998, sentencing order, is a determination to be made in the first instance by the Commonwealth Court. That court shall undertake such determination consistent with the content of this Order.\nJustice BAER dissents as he believes the sentencing court\u2019s December 10,1998 order is ambiguous.\n. The maximum sentence of 60 months was later adjusted by the Superior Court to 59 months for reasons unrelated to this appeal. See Commonwealth v. Foley, No. 113 WDA 99, slip op. (Pa.Super. July 27, 1999).\n. For example, the letter acknowledges that the sentencing order required credit for certain prior intervals of incarceration, and ultimately states that such \u2018\u2018[c]redit has been denied\u201d based on the Department\u2019s own interpretation of decisional law.
