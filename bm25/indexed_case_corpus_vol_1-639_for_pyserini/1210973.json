{"id": "1210973", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\n\" Carl Garland, who is serving a minimum term of three and one-half years in the Western State Penitentiary after his conviction on a charge of felonious assault with a deadly weapon, to wit, a revolver, with intent to kill, is seeking his release on a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that the.sentence of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Allegheny County is void because \u201cthe Federal Government made the original arrest, they took lawful control, thereby obtaining exclusive jurisdiction\u201d and \u201cthe judgment of the Court of Quarter Sessions caused a double jeopardy status to exist.\u201d\nOn December 11, 1934, the relator entered a plea of guilty in the Federal Court to the charge of interfering with an officer. The Court placed the relator on probation for one year; \u201csaid probation to become effective at the expiration of the sentence imposed in the Allegheny County Court.\u201d The assault with intent to kill was made against a Federal officer and the two offenses, i. e., both the state and the federal offenses, arose out of the same act.\nThe relator\u2019s petition must be dismissed. The Fifth Amendment to the Federal Constitution which declares that no person shall for the same offense be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb is a restriction only on the power of the Federal Government: Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 534. The tenth section of the Pennsylvania Bill of Rights also contains a prohibition against a person being \u201ctwice put in jeopardy of life or limb\u201d and is a restriction on the power of the state government. But the same act \u201cdenounced as a crime by both national and state sovereignties is an offense against the peace and dignity of both and may be punished by each. The double jeopardy therein forbidden [i. e., in the Fifth Amendment] is a second prosecution under authority of the Federal Government after a first trial for the same offense under the same authority.\u201d: United States v. Lanza, 260 U. S. 377, 382.\nEven in the same jurisdiction the same criminal intent when manifested in two distinct crimes may result in two legal convictions of crime. \u201cThe test of identity of offenses when double jeopardy is pleaded [in the courts of the same sovereignty] is whether the same evidence is required to sustain them; and if not, then the fact that both charges relate to and grow out of one transaction does not make a single offense where more than one are defined by\u2019 the statute.\u201d: Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S. 338.\nRelator also contends that \u201csince the Federal government made the original arrest, it took lawful control, thereby obtaining exclusive jurisdiction until the subject matter was fully performed and exhausted.\u201d The answer to that contention is that if the Federal government chooses to deliver to the state authorities a Federal prisoner so that the state may proceed against the prisoner for an offense committed against the state\u2019s peace and good order, the prisoner has no grounds for complaint. The question is purely one of comity between two sovereignties. The fact that the state government could not compel the Federal government to surrender the prisoner to it, is of no avail to the prisoner when he is in fact so surrendered.\nThe relator further avers that he was \u201cdenied his constitutional rights to he present at the preliminary hearing, to face his accusers and to learn the nature of the charge, to wit: felonious assault.\u201d He adds: \u201cThere is no controversy over the second count of the indictment, since petitioner was afforded the rights of a preliminary hearing on these accusations, but at no time was petitioner afforded such right on the charge of assault.\u201d Apparently the complaint of relator on this point is that the charges made against him in the two counts of the indictment were not set out as two distinct charges in the information made against him. The two charges in the indictment are in substance as follows: First count: Felonious assault with a loaded revolver with intent to kill a designated person; Second count: Unlawfully discharging a loaded revolver at a certain designated person.\nIn the information used to institute a criminal proceeding the charge made as a basis for a warrant to bring the accused before the proper tribunal does not have to be set forth with the particularity of an indictment. It is enough if the information states a criminal offense committed by the defendant, its general nature, and its time and place. The two counts in the indictment against this relator were based on the facts set forth in the information. Section 8, Article I, of the State Constitution provides that \u201cno warrant ... to seize any person or things shall issue . . . without probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation\u201d and section 9 gives the accused \u201cthe right to demand the nature and cause of the accusation against him, to meet the witnesses face to face\u201d, etc. The record shows that the relator was not deprived of these or any other constitutional rights.\nThe writ is refused."}
