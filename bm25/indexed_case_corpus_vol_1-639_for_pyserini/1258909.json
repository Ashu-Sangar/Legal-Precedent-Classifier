{"id": "1258909", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Arnold,\nThe defendant was indicted, tried before a jury, and found guilty of murder in tbe first degree, the penalty being fixed at life imprisonment. At trial he was represented by able counsel who had wide experience in homicide cases, but who did not argue this appeal.\nDefendant had gone to his wife\u2019s home, some distance from his own residence, and when she called her mother on the telephone, lie called into the telephone that by the time the mother got there the daughter would be dead, \u2014 which statement he made come true. He quite clearly shot his wife, Dorothy, with a 22 calibre target pistol, causing wounds from which she died. He then turned the same weapon upon himself, inflicting a wound from which he fully recovered. \u00c1t the hospital to which he was taken he admitted the'shooting of his wife.\nThe pistol was obtained by the defendant two days before the shooting, although he testified he had obtained it on the same day. He wrote two notes to his father and mother, stating h\u00e9 was going to commit suicide because of the unrequited love he had for his wife. He did not testify that he did hot shoot her, but testified that he did not intend to kill her or to do anything more than scare her. This the jury did not believe.\nThe defendant testified that he was drunk, and that his wife had said he was half Mexican and half Puerto Rican and refused to have children by him out of fear that they would be black. The jury obviously rejected the contentions of the defendant, who brings this appeal.\nWe have here the acquiring of the murder weapon two days before the homicide, thus evidencing premeditation; and the statement to the mother of the deceased that the wife would be dead before the mother reached her. The fact that the defendant twice shot his wife is evidence of malice: Commonwealth v. Drum, 58 Pa. 9, 17; Commonwealth v. Chapman, 359 Pa. 164, 167, 168, 58 A. 2d 433.\nThe appellant further contends that the assistant erred in its comment on the guilt of the defendant. The court had a right to so comment so long as the jury was told that the court\u2019s opinion was not binding upon it, and the court left that determination to the jury. This the court did. See Commonwealth v. Bibalo, 375 Pa. 257, 100 A. 2d 45; Commonwealth v. Lance, 381 Pa. 293, 113 A. 2d 290.\nThe appellant\u2019s first contention is that the court district attorney in his closing address to the jury said: \u201cHe [the defendant] lied about where he got the gun,\u201d and contends that the trial court erred in overruling his motion .for the withdrawal of a .juror. The defendant\u2019s objection was. not timely as it. was made at the conclusion of..the.assistant district attorney\u2019s address; but even if it. was timely- the action of. the trial judge was the subject of his .sound discretion. See Commonwealth v. Wilcox, 112 Pa. Superior Ct. 240, 316 Pa. 129, 173 A. 653, and Commonwealth v. Kerr, 171 Pa. Superior Ct. 131, 89 A. 2d 889. In Commonwealth v. Meyers, 290 Pa. 573, 581, 139 A. 374, this Court stated: \u201cWhere, under all the circumstances of the case, the verdict rendered is a just one, the language of the prosecuting officer which will justify a reversal must be such that its unavoidable effect . would be to prejudice the jury ...\u201d In the following eases the district attorney used such phrases as \u201ca typical gunman\u2019s defense\u201d: Commonwealth v. DelVaccio, 299 Pa. 547, 554, 149 A. 696; \u201cdefense was cooked, up\u201d: Commonwealth v. Massarelli, 304 Pa. 335, 338, 156 A. 101; \u201cthe prisoner didn\u2019t have the heart of a man or the soul of a man\u201d: Commonwealth v. Smith, 270 Pa. 583, 588, 113 A. 844; \u201cI will ask you to say that they [the eyewitnesses who had fled the jurisdiction] are staying away from this jurisdiction for the purpose of helping this criminal\u201d: Commonwealth v. Touri, 295 Pa. 50, 57, 144 A. 761; \u201cthe defendant might be called a skunk\u201d: Commonwealth v. Davison, 99 Pa. Superior Ct. 412, 414. None of these was held to be prejudicial error. We find no merit in this contention.\nThe next contention is that the court took away from the jury the right to render a verdict of voluntary manslaughter. Since there was no evidence to reduce the crime to voluntary manslaughter, that point is settled by Commonwealth v. Yeager, 329 Pa. 81, 85, 196 A. 827; Commonwealth v. LaRue, 381 Pa. 113, 112 A. 2d 362. The ..evidence of the defendant was that his wife made.remarks .about him that enflamed him, and had emphasised ..them-by'.sticking .her. finger .at his shoulder. .-..The- law. of. -.Pennsylvania;is clear- .that no \u2022words, of- provocation-,creproachy. abuse: or . slight assault are.'sufficient to .free .the \u2019.party- from. guilt;,of \u2022 murder. \u25a0The\u2019.legal \u201cbattery\u201d; committed-.in this, case- was of a most trivial nature which,- .combined with the words used, is of no moment in reducing the crime to manslaughter: Commonwealth v. Newson, 277 Pa. 48, 120 A. 707.\nThe charge by the court on reasonable doubt was unimpeachable in the light of the fact that no further elaboration of instructions was asked for by the trial counsel. While the court did not specifically charge that character evidence alone might work an acquittal of the defendant, no exception was taken to this charge nor was the matter raised in a motion for new trial. However, in the absence of a request for such instruction, it was not error to fail to charge it. This Court said in Commonwealth v. Barnak, 357 Pa. 391, 419, 54 A. 2d 865: \u201cTaking an appeal in criminal cases is not a game in which the appellant wins if he can show that the trial judge fell a few degrees short of perfection in the conduct of his trial. This court has consistently refused to reverse convictions of murder in the first degree, even with the death penalty imposed, for errors in the conduct of the trial or in the admission of evidence or in the judge\u2019s charge, when these errors did not deprive the defendant of the fundamentals of a fair trial.\u201d In Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U. S. 750, 764, the United States Supreme Court said: \u201cIf, when all is said and done, the conviction is sure that the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight' effect, the verdict and the judgment should stand . . .\u201d (Italics supplied). The court charged practically that character-evidence alone would justify an acquittal. We are not impressed by the fact that the court stated that it was its \u201cconviction\u201d that \u201cunder the evidence ... a verdict of not guilty would be a miscarriag\u00e9 of justice. However, my opinion is not binding upon you.\u201d This was not harmful t\u00f3 the defendant and the jury could not have drawn the distinction between the use of the word \u201cconviction\u201d and the use of the word \u201copinion\u201d which the appellant claims. It would be unwarrantable to hold that the jurors in this case, who were undoubtedly laymen, \u2014 not philologists or lexicographers, \u2014 would understand the word \u201cconviction\u201d to be something different than \u201copinion.\u201d The court is not obliged to use any particular phrase in the absence of request for such charge: Commonwealth v. Beingo, 217 Pa. 60, 62, 66 A. 153.\nThe appellant asks that the conviction be reversed because the court did not charge that admissions of the defendant should have been received with great caution. It was for the jury to say that the confession was voluntarily made. This the jury found and this was not denied by the defendant.\nThis is of the highest grade of evidence. Again this point was not raised by any exception to the charge nor on the motion for new trial.\nNext the defendant challenges the court\u2019s comment on the evidence. The court had a complete right to comment thereon, providing the jury was told that the court\u2019s opinion was not binding upon it. See Commonwealth v. Chambers, 367 Pa. 159, 164, 79 A. 2d 201; Commonwealth v. Bibalo, 375 Pa. 257, 100 A. 2d 45.\nThe court charged that the jurors must not be guided by any prejudice against the defendant nor, on the other hand, be swayed by any sympathy toward him, and again charged: \u201cYou . . . must discharge . . . [your] duty . . . without sympathy for the defendant or prejudice against him.\u201d This was a correct statement. See Commonwealth v. Silcox, 161 Pa. 484, 29 A. 105.\nWe are requested to alter the rule in Commonwealth v. Drum, 58 Pa. 9, which we are unwilling to do.\nWe have reviewed the law and the evidence under the Act of 1870, P. L. 15, 19 PS \u00a71187, and find that \u2022the verdict of the jury is amply supported by the evidence. The defendant was fortunate that he did not receive a recommendation of the death penalty at the hands of the jury.\nThe judgment of sentence is affirmed.\nCf. Territory v. Buick, 27 Haw. 28, 37."}
