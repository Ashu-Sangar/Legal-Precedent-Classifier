{"id": "124751", "contents": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nWe granted allocatur to address two issues first, whether the lower courts applied the correct standard in considering Appellant\u2019s petition to withdraw a plea; second, whether the lower courts erred in denying that petition to withdraw the plea. For the following reasons, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand for further proceedings in the common pleas court.\nThe facts relevant to this appeal are as follows. On May 5, 1997, Appellant was arrested and charged with various violations of the Crimes Code. On May 14, 1997, a preliminary hearing was held and a trial date was set for August 25, \u2022 1997.\nOn August 20, 1997, Appellant pleaded nolo contendere to some of the charges as part of an agreement where the Commonwealth agreed to drop the remaining charges and recommend a prison sentence of three to six years. The court administered no oral colloquy, but Appellant answered fifty-nine individual questions on a written colloquy which he signed, as did his counsel. The court accepted the plea and, on the same day, sentenced Appellant according to the Commonwealth\u2019s recommendation.\nThrough new counsel, eight days later, Appellant filed a motion to withdraw his plea as well as a motion to modify sentence. The court held a hearing at which Appellant and his original counsel testified. Both motions were denied.\nThe pertinent testimony at that hearing revealed that Appellant and his privately retained counsel had a strong disagreement as to whether Appellant should accept the Commonwealth\u2019s offer. Appellant\u2019s relevant testimony is revealed in the record as follows\nQ. And if you could describe your professional relationship with [former counsel]?\nA. We had our differences about taking it to trial.\nQ. Would you elaborate on those differences?\nA. She wanted me to accept the plea bargain and I didn\u2019t want to accept it.\nQ And did you enter a nolo contendere plea on August 20, 1997?\nA. Yes, I did.\nQ. Prior to your entering that plea, did you and [former counsel] have any disagreement?\nA. Yes, we did.\nQ. And could you elaborate upon that disagreement?\nA. She came up to the prison with the plea bargain and I didn\u2019t want to take the plea and that\u2019s basically what it was over. I mean I didn\u2019t want to take the plea bargain.\nQ. Did she make any comments to you with respect to taking this case to trial if you weren\u2019t going to accept the plea?\nA. Yes.\nQ. What were those comments?\nA. The one was she said if I take this to trial, she would consider kicking it to the PD\u2019s office because she felt that she couldn\u2019t see me getting, you know, more time than the actual plea bargain.\nQ. And did she ever make any comments about taking this case to trial or not taking this case to trial?\nA. After we selected the jury, I was pretty sure we were going to go to trial.\nQ. Well, how did you feel with respect \u2014 what did you feel about her preparation for this particular upcoming trial?\nA. I felt that she didn\u2019t do a very good job with questioning any of my witnesses. She didn\u2019t do that.\nOn direct examination as a Commonwealth witness, Appellant\u2019s previous counsel stated:\nQ. Did you ever threaten to abandon him by as he said kicking it to the PD\u2019s office?\nA. I told [Appellant] that I had a very difficult time with the concept that he would get more than three to six years in prison and I had also discussed this with yourself [the Commonwealth] and the Judge on the day of the plea and indicated that I was not sure that I would be able to continue to represent [Appellant] if he indeed wanted to proceed to trial because I felt that it was so much against his best interest. I felt very, very strongly on that.\nOn cross-examination:\nQ. Had you ever told [Appellant] that you felt unprepared to go to trial?\nA. I told [Appellant] it would be a lot of work to get ready for trial. I had been under the impression \u2014 the last time we had spoken prior to the August 20th plea he had indicated to me that he intended to take the plea and that he felt that that was the best thing for him to do. He didn\u2019t like it, but he felt that was the best thing for him to do so, therefore, I did not spend time prior to that getting ready for trial because I was under the impression that he was not going to have a problem accepting the plea.\nOn appeal, the Superior Court examined Appellant\u2019s motion to withdraw plea in light of ineffective assistance of counsel jurisprudence. The court found that counsel explained to Appellant the meaning of a nolo contendere plea and that \u201c[a]fter Appellant understood that he did not have to admit he had committed the crimes, he voluntarily agreed to so plead; he did not insist upon his innocence.\u201d Superior Court mem. at 8.\nAt the time of Appellant\u2019s plea, our rules required that \u201c[t]he judge shall conduct a separate inquiry of the defendant on the record to determine whether the defendant understands and voluntarily accepts the terms of the plea agreement on which the guilty plea is based.\u201d Pa.R.Crim.P. 319(b)(2). The comment, which accompanied this rule, stated:\nIt is difficult to formulate a comprehensive list of questions a judge must ask of a defendant in determining whether the judge should accept the plea of guilty. Court decisions may add areas to be encompassed in determining whether the defendant understands the full impact and consequences of the plea, but is nevertheless willing to enter that plea. At a minimum the judge should ask questions to elicit the following information:\n(1) Does the defendant understand the nature of the charges to which he or she is pleading guilty?\n(2) Is there a factual basis for the plea?\n(3) Does the defendant understand that he or she has the right to trial by jury?\n(4) Does the defendant understand that he or she is presumed innocent until found guilty?\n(5) Is the defendant aware of the permissible range of sentences and/or fines for the offenses charged?\n(6) Is the defendant aware that the judge is not bound by the terms of any plea agreement tendered unless the judge accepts such agreement.\nPa.R.Crim.P. 319 (Comment).\nThere are two different standards for withdrawal of a plea. When a motion to withdraw a plea is made prior to sent\u00e9ncing, the motion should be granted where the defendant has offered a \u201cfair and just reason.\u201d See Commonwealth v. Forbes, 450 Pa. 185, 299 A.2d 268 (1973), and also, Commonwealth v. Randolph, 553 Pa. 224, 718 A.2d 1242 (1998). At the time of Appellant\u2019s proceedings before the trial court, Pa. R.Crim.P. 320 stated \u201c[a]t any time before sentence, the court may, in its discretion, permit or direct a plea of guilty to be withdrawn and a plea of not guilty to be substituted.\u201d\nOn the other hand, in order to withdraw a plea after sentencing the defendant must show that the court, by denying withdrawal, would be sanctioning a manifest injustice. Such a manifest injustice occurs when a plea is not tendered knowingly, intelligently, voluntarily, and understandingly. See Commonwealth v. Persinger, 532 Pa. 317, 615 A.2d 1305 (1992).\nThe different treatment of pre- and postsentence motions reflects the tension in our jurisprudence between the individual\u2019s fundamental right to a trial and the need for finality in the proceedings. We see no reason to change this longstanding principle at this time. Thus, we are left to consider whether the common pleas court\u2019s refusal to grant the motion to withdraw the plea in this instance results in a manifest injustice.\nInitially, our examination of the written colloquy reveals two errors that we find are of grave consequence. We note that Appellant did not plead guilty, but rather pleaded nolo contendere. Colloquy question number 20 asks \u201cDo you understand that by pleading guilty, you are admitting that you committed the crimes charges? [sic]\u201d and question number 58 asks \u201cDo you admit that you committed the crimes with which you are charged and to which you are pleading guilty?\u201d At the plea hearing, counsel crossed off Appellant\u2019s \u201cYes\u201d answers and wrote in \u201cNolo\u201d next to both of these questions. Appellant apparently then initialed both of these answers at the court\u2019s request. Not a single question of the 59 listed on the colloquy addresses the plea of nolo contendere and the ramifications of entering such a plea. Examples of this deficiency are: question number 18 which reads \u201cDo you fully understand that by pleading guilty you are giving up all of these rights described in the previous questions?\u201d; question number 22, \u201cBy pleading guilty you give up certain rights of appeal ...\u201d; and question number 47, \u201cDo you understand that when you plead guilty and your plea is accepted by the Court, all that remains is for the Court to sentence you on the charges to which your [sic] are pleading, but if your plea is rejected, your case will be sent back for reassignment to another judge for trial?\u201d We find it critical that this colloquy makes no mention of the plea Appellant actually entered. If anything, Appellant\u2019s plea and answers to the colloquy indicate that he was aware of the consequences of pleading guilty and was seeking to avoid them.\nThe second deficiency of the colloquy is that two crucial answers were changed. Question number 50 asks, \u201cAre you doing this of your own free will?\u201d The answer appears to be \u201cNo\u201d crossed out and replaced by \u201cYes\u201d. Question number 56 asks, \u201cAre you presently taking any medication which might affect your thinking or your free will?\u201d This time it appears that \u201cYes\u201d was crossed out and replaced by \u201cNo\u201d. Appellant testified at the hearing on his petition to withdraw the plea that, \u201cI felt I wasn\u2019t doing this on my own free will, that\u2019s why I put no and [counsel] says I have to put yes down on there so I crossed it out and I put yes down.\u201d While we acknowledge that the initial responses may have been erroneously entered by Appellant and then corrected, we are extremely concerned that Appellant was not questioned further about these answers for the sake of determining, on the record, that the plea was being entered of his own free will.\nFinally, we have the testimony of Appellant\u2019s attorney who stated that she was not yet prepared for trial and that she would have had difficulty in continuing to represent Appellant if he did not accept the plea agreement.\nIn Forbes, a minor entered a guilty plea to murder after the trial court conducted an on-the-record colloquy. A month later, a three-judge panel convened to determine the degree of murder. Before the panel, however, the defendant requested to withdraw his guilty plea and proceed to trial stating \u201cI don\u2019t want to plead guilty to nothing I didn\u2019t do.\u201d Another month passed and the defendant said he no longer desired to pursue his withdrawal request, and the panel reconvened to determine the degree of guilt. At that time, it became apparent that defendant\u2019s decision to abandon his withdrawal request was the result of defense counsel\u2019s threat to withdraw from the case. The defendant was found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.\nWhile Forbes is often cited for the liberal standard to be applied to pre-sentence motions to withdraw a plea, as previously explained, we also stated:\nA guilty plea which is not the personal and voluntary decision of the accused, but rather is \u201cinduced by promises or threats which deprive it of the character of a voluntary act, is void.\u201d Marchibroda[Machibroda] v. United States, 368 U.S. 487[493, 82 S.Ct. 510, 513, 7 L.E.2d 473] (1962).\n299 A.2d at 271. The coercive circumstance of Forbes, was that the defendant\u2019s counsel threatened to abandon his client if the defendant did not renounce his desire to withdraw his guilty plea, a circumstance which \u201crendered involuntary appellant\u2019s decision to abandon his withdrawal request and continue with his original guilty plea.\u201d Id. at 270. Furthermore, \u201cwhat plea to enter is a decision which must be made voluntarily and intelligently, by the accused.\u201d Id.\nConsidering the facts of the present case, a lack of oral colloquy, a written colloquy which did not explain to Appellant the effect of his nolo contendere plea, and dubious representation, we cannot conclude that this plea was knowingly and freely entered into, and therefore permitting it is a manifest injustice. The plea is void and we remand to the Centre County Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings.\nJustices CAPPY and NIGRO file concurring opinions.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion in which Justice CASTILLE and Justice NEWMAN join.\n. This rule was amended, effective January 1, 2000, and now includes a plea of nolo contendere.\n. The comment to Pa.R.Crim.P. 319 was amended effective January 1, 2000, and now contemplates pleas of nolo contendere as well as guilty pleas.\n. This rule has been amended and effective January 1, 2000 reads:\nRULE 320. WITHDRAWAL OF PLEA OF GUILTY OR NOLO CONTENDERE\n(A) At any time before the imposition of sentence, die court may, in its discretion, permit, upon motion of die defendant, or direct, sua sponte, the withdrawal of the plea of guilty or nolo contendere and the substitution of a plea of not guilty.\n(B) When a defendant moves for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the attorney for the Commonwealth shall be given 10 days to respond.\n. The Rules of Professional Conduct state:\nRULE 1.2 Scope of Representation\n(a) A lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation .... In a criminal case, the lawyer shall.abide by the client's decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify."}
