{"id": "1028224", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, November 9th 1871, by\nSharswood, J.\nThe word \u201c issue\u201d in a will means prim\u00e1 facie the same thing as \u201c heirs of the body,\u201d and in general is to be construed as a word of limitation; but this construction will give way, if there be on the face of the instrument sufficient to show that the word was intended to have a less extended meaning and to be applied only to children, or to descendants of a particular class or at a particular time. The authorities in support of this general rule are cited in Taylor v. Taylor, 13 P. F. Smith 484, to which may be added Gast v. Baer, 12 P. F. Smith 35, and Angle v. Brosius, 7 Wright 187. \u201c The word \u2018 issue,\u2019 \u201d says Mr. Justice Strong, \u201cis well adapted for a word of limitation, having much more aptitude for such an use than it has to designate the objects of a gift. In signification it very nearly resembles the technical phrase \u2018heirs of the body,\u2019 and indeed the two were used as synonyms in the statute de donis. Hence it has long been settled, that,when real estate is devised by one or more limitations in the same will to a person and his issue, the word issue will be construed as a word of limitation so as to give the ancestor an estate tail, unless there are expressions in the will unequivocally indicative of a contrary intention.\u201d Even, therefore, though there should be an estate for life in express terms, and a devise to issue in remainder on the death of the tenant for life, either expressly or by implication only, as by a devise over for want or in default of issue, unless there is something to contradict unequivocally the presumed intention that the devise over shall not take effect until the whole line of issue is extinct, the rule of law is an unbending one, which vests the inheritance in tail in the first taker. The particular intent must give way to the general one. The rule in Shelley\u2019s Case is not a rule of construction\u2014 not a means of ascertaining the intention of the testator. It presupposes that intention to be ascertained. It is a rule of law which declares inexorably that where the ancestor takes a preceding freehold by the same instrument,, whether deed or will, a remainder shall not be limited to his heirs as purchasers. When we determine that by \u201cissue\u201d he means heirs of the body \u2014 the entire line taking in succession by descent \u2014 the rule has the same application. If given as an immediate remainder after the freehold it shall vest as an executed estate of inheritance in the ancestor; if mediately after some other interposed estate, then it shall vest in him as a remainder: Doebler\u2019s Appeal, 14 P. F. Smith 17. In Paxson v. Lefferts, 3 Rawle 59, where a testator devised his plantation to his son during his natural life, and if he shall leave lawful issue, then to them, their heirs and assigns for ever, but for want of such lawful issue then over, it was held clearly to be an estate tail in the son. The principal difficulty in that case was in the superadded words of limitation to the devise to the issue \u2014 \u201cto them, their heirs and assigns for ever,\u201d from which it was argued that these words showed that the issues were not intended to take \u201c qua heirs,\u201d but to be root of a new succession. Mr. Justice Kennedy, who delivered the opinion of the court, shows by authority that this makes no difference, and that according to the doctrine of Mr. Fearne, in his Treatise on Contingent Remainders, even words of limitation superadded, if not inconsistent with the nature of the descent (pointed out by the first words) will not convert them into words of purchase; and he cites in illustration the case of Dodson v. Grew, 2 Wils. 322, where the word \u201cissue\u201d was the term employed by the testator. There the devise was \u201cto A. for life, remainder to the issue male of his body lawfully to be begotten, and the heirs male of the body of such issue male, and for want of such issue male over,\u201d and held that A. took an estate tail.\nIt is not easy to perceive any difference between the words of the will in Paxson v. Lefferts and those of the will of Felix Laverty, now before us, which ought to be received as indicative of a different intention. There was there a devise for life; then if the devisee should leave lawful issue, to such issue, and for want of such issue, over. Here it is to Mary Ann for life; upon the happening of her death, to her lawful issue, if she should leave any \u2014 in default of such issue, over. There are no words of superadded limitation in the will of Felix Laverty as there was in that of John Knight; but this only makes the caso stronger in favor of the defendant in error. There is nothing to indicate that by issue Eelix Laverty meant \u201c children,\u201d or only such issue as should be living at the period of his daughter\u2019s death \u2014 nothing to show that he did not mean that which the words prim\u00e1 facie and naturally import, that the estate was not to go over to his brothers and sisters until the whole line of his descendants through his daughter Mary Ann was extinct. Indeed when he comes, in a subsequent part of his will, to make a disposition of his personal estate, he indicates pretty clearly by the introduction of other words besides those used in the disposition of his real estate, that he intended a difference. After directing the interest of his personal estate to be paid over to his daughter Mary Ann for her own use, he provides that \u201c upon her death the principal to be paid to any lawful issue she may leave surviving her, and in default of such issue, and upon the happening of her death, and not before, the said principal moneys to be divided equally among my aforesaid brothers and sisters, and their heirs.\u201d Had these words \u201csurviving her\u201d been found in the disposition of his real estate it would have been some indication of an intention that he meant \u201c children\u201d or \u201c issue then living.\u201d That he omitted them there and inserted them here, shows that he had not that intention as to his real estate. The issue of the daughter Mary Ann were to take her real estate upon the happening of her death as heirs of her body \u2014 qua heirs, and the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case must be held to apply. The consequence is that Mary Ann took an estate tail, which, by the Act' of April 27th 1855 (Pamph. L. 368), shall be taken and construed to be an estate in fee simple, and as such shall be inheritable and freely alienable.\nJudgment affirmed."}
