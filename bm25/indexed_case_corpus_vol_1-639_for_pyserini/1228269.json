{"id": "1228269", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nPlaintiff filed a bill in equity to restrain alleged unlawful picketing by defendants who thereupon entered a general appearance. A hearing was had and a preliminary injunction issued.\nOne week later, on August 15,1950, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the bill on the ground that the bill did not have endorsed thereon any notice to defendants to file an answer. This motion was denied.\nOn September 6, 1950, defendants filed preliminary objections to the bill on the ground that the bill failed to notify defendants to file an answer. The court below sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the bill. This appeal followed.\nPlaintiff neglected to ask the court below for leave to amend, which he should have done. He now asks leave to do so. The court below could have granted leave to amend without plaintiff\u2019s request. Defendants suffered no harm from the failure of plaintiff to notify them to plead.\nIn the interest of justice plaintiff should be permitted to amend his complaint by filing a notice to plead thereon.\nOrder reversed with directions to the court below to permit plaintiff to amend his complaint by filing a notice to plead thereon and with a procedendo. Costs to abide the event."}
