{"id": "1885981", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nOn March 9, 1960\u2014survived by neither spouse nor issue\u2014Elizabeth A. Pinney (decedent) a resident of Delaware County, died.\nOn October 11, 1955, decedent\u2014then 85 or 86 years of age\u2014entered into a written agreement with a Mrs. Hazel Liddell (Mrs. Liddell) which agreement read as follows: \u201cI, [decedent], have requested [Mrs. Liddell], my husband\u2019s cousin, to live with me, so that when and if I become infirm or helpless, she shall give me the loving care of a sister in Christ, for the balance of my days. Since she is the closest relative of my husband and myself (in this country), and the loved one who will best minister to my needs, it is my desire now, and was my husband\u2019s and my desire before he went home, that she receive my property at 115 Barker Ave Sharon Hill.\n\u201cI, [Mrs. Liddell], agree to accede to [decedent\u2019s] request and will take up my residence with her at 115 Barker Ave. I further agree to share in the expenses of the house to the amount of thirty dollars per month at present; but will continue my present career in nursing as long as [decedent] has a suitable companion living with her. Should.she be left alone, or need care for any reason, I agree to tend her as a, loving sister in Christ for the balance of her life.\u201d\nOn January 25, 1960, decedent made a will in which she created a trust consisting of her entire estate. Under the terms of that trust, the trustees were \u201cto use the income for the benefit of . . . [Mrs. Liddell], for and during the term of her natural life\u201d; if the trustees so determined, they could sell the realty, invest the principal and use the income for Mrs. Liddell\u2019s benefit; if deemed necessary by the trustees, they could use any part of the principal for. Mrs. Liddell\u2019s benefit; upon Mrs. Liddell\u2019s death, the trustees were directed to \u201cuse the principal or the balance, ther\u00e9of in the Lord\u2019s Work in any way that they shall choose.\u2019.\u2019\nSometime subsequent to October 11, 1955\u2014the date of the agreement\u2014Mrs. Liddell did go to live with the decedent and she remained there not only until decedent\u2019s death but until her own death on December 30, 1961.\nAfter the death of Mrs. Liddell,'decedent\u2019s trustees filed their first and final account in the. Orphans\u2019 Court of Delaware County and requested that-court'to distribute the balance in. the account in accordance with the provisions of decedent\u2019s testamentary trust At audit, Mrs. Liddell\u2019s personal representative claimed the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the realty on the basis of the 1955 agreement and, after hearing, the court directed distribution of such balance to the' estate of Mrs. Liddell. From that decree this appeal is taken.\nCertain well settled legal principles are presently applicable: (1) an agreement to devise one's property to a particular person is binding and irrevocable when supported by what the law regards as valid consideration (Liggins Estate, 393 Pa. 500, 505, 143 A. 2d 349); (2) the consideration is provable by parol evidence (Herr Estate, 400 Pa. 90, 94, 161 A. 2d 32); (3) in interpreting such an agreement, the court can always consider the surrounding circumstances in order to ascertain the intent and meaning of the parties (Herr Estate, supra, pp. 93, 94); (4) a written agreement which purports to leave at one's death, or to give by will, a particular piece of real estate complies with and satisfies the Statute of Frauds (Herr Estate, supra, 96 and cases therein cited).\nA study and examination of the 1955 written agreement clearly indicates- that decedent required of Mrs. Liddell (a) that she live with her, (b) that, if decedent became' \u201cinfirm or helpless\u201d, Mrs. Liddell would care for her and (c) that Mrs. Liddell would share to the extent of $30 monthly the .expenses of the household. On her part, Mrs. Liddell agreed (a) to share the household expenses to the extent of-$30 monthly and (b) to \u201ctend\u201d the decedent if she \u201cbe left alone or need care for any reason\u201d, but she .expressly reserved the right to continue in her nursing profession so long as decedent had- a \u201csuitable companion\u201d. In return for the performance of her engagements, Mrs. Liddell was to- receive the specified property.\n, Decedent\u2019s trustees contend: (a) that, by reason-of the failure of Mrs. Liddell, subsequent to decedent\u2019s death; to take steps to enforce the 1955 agreement,- she acquiesced in the terms of the. will and such acquiescence.created a supersession of the 1955. agreement by the will;-(b) that the 1955 agreement was not a contract to give this property to Mrs. Liddell; (c) that, by. her conduct after decedent\u2019s death, Mrs. Liddell placed a construction on the meaning of the 1955 agreement contrary to that found by the court.\nNeither the factual situation nor the law applicable thereto supports any of the. contentions of decedent\u2019s- trustees. The 1955 agreement constituted a valid and enforceable contract between the parties and the-, record, positively, clearly and convincingly, .shows that Mrs. Liddell substantially performed all her engagements nrideT such\u2019 agreement and gave full arid adequate consideration within the meaning and intent of the parties.\nIn our view, the court below properly directed distribution of the balance of the proceeds of the . sale of the realty shown by the account to the personal representative of Mrs. Liddell\u2019s estate in accordance with the terms of the agreement rather than in accordance with the terms, of the will.\nDecree affirmed. Each party, to pay own costs.\nThe execution of this agreement by both parties, the mental competency and understanding of decedent at the time and the fact that the agreement was duly witnessed\u2014by those individuals who now in their fiduciary capacities oppose the claim based on this agreement\u2014are admitted of record.\nThis account indicated that, -after Mrs. Liddell\u2019s death, the property at 115 Barker Aye. had been Sold and that the proceeds from such- sale amounted to .$9,856.85.\nSpecifically, two-thirds to Community Gospel Chapel, Park-side, Pa., and one-third to Gospel Home for- Aged Christians, Long-port, New Jersey.\nThe record shows that from January 1956 until decedent\u2019s death, Mrs. Liddell regularly paid $30 each month to decedent. Even after decedent\u2019s death, Mrs. Liddell paid in excess of $1900 toward the taxes,. including inheritance tax of $500, on the property as well as the expenses of maintenance and repair of the property."}
