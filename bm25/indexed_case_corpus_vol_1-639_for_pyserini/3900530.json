The issue, as stated by Petitioner, is:\nDoes a lender\u2019s use of the Uniform Act 91 Notice divest a trial court of subject matter jurisdiction and require setting aside a completed Sheriffs Sale, vacating a consent judgment, and dismissing a foreclosure action where any claimed defect in the notice implicates only jurisdiction based on a procedural matter, the lender had no discretion in the form of notice it used, the notice was prescribed by the PHFA consistent with express statutory authorization, and the record shows that the borrower-in-default suffered no prejudice from the lender\u2019s use of the Uniform Act 91 Notice, received all the protections contemplated by Act 91, and waived any claim of a procedural defect concerning Act 91?\nAdditionally, the parties are directed to brief the following issue:\nWhether the recently-enacted Homeowner Assistance Settlement Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 1681.1 et seq., affects our disposition. See Greenough v. Greenough, 11 Pa. 489 (1849). See also Commonwealth v. Shaffer, 557 Pa. 453, 734 A.2d 840, 843-844 (1999)."}
