{"id": "225946", "contents": "OPINION\nNEWMAN, Justice.\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Commonwealth) has appealed from the Order of the Superior Court, which reversed the trial court\u2019s imposition of sentence pursuant to the enhancement provisions in 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7508. We reverse the Order of the Superior Court, and remand for consideration of the Constitutional challenges raised, but not addressed.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nIn June of 1997, Eddie Vasquez (Vasquez) was arrested and charged with delivering cocaine to an undercover officer on a number of occasions. At the time of his arrest, Vasquez had no prior convictions for drug offenses. A single criminal information was filed against Vasquez, charging him with various counts related to the delivery of cocaine. On January 6,1998, Vasquez pled guilty to two charges related to separate drug transactions, one occurring on June 16, 1997, and the other on June 26, 1997. The Commonwealth filed a notice of intention to seek the mandatory sentence applicable to the case pursuant t\u00f3 ,18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7508. The specific wording of the statute provides, in relevant part, that:\n(a) General rule. \u2014 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this or any other act to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply:. ... [I]f at the time of sentencing the defendant has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense: three years in prison and $10,000 or such larger amount as is sufficient to exhaust the assets utilized in and the proceeds from the illegal activity;\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7508(a)(3)(i)(emphasis added). The trial court sentenced Vasquez to one to two years on the first count for delivering cocaine and then applied the enhancement provision of Section 7508 to the second count, sentencing Vasquez to three to six years. Thus, Vasquez received an aggregate sentence of not less than four years with a maximum not to exceed eight years, and an aggregate fine of $15,000.00.'\nVasquez filed a motion for reconsideration of his sentence, which the trial court denied. On appeal to the Superior Court, Vasquez raised three issues:' one regarding the application of Section 7508 as applied to multiple convictions contained within the same criminal complaint and two constitutional challenges relating to \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d and \u201cseparation of powers.\u201d Addressing only the issue of statutory interpretation, the Superior Court reversed the trial court.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this matter, we are called upon to determine whether a conviction within a multiple count complaint can be counted as a \u201cprior conviction\u201d such that the enhancement provision of Section 7508 applies. The Commonwealth argues that the statute unambiguously states that if at the time of \u201csentencing\u201d the defendant has been \u201cconvicted\u201d of another drug offense, the defendant\u2019s sentence is enhanced. See Commonwealth v. Williams, 539 Pa. 249, 652 A.2d 283 (1994) and Commonwealth v. Plass, 431 Pa.Super. 251, 636 A.2d 637, aff'd, 539 Pa. 248, 652 A.2d 283 (1994). It is irrelevant that the prior conviction arises from one count within a multiple count complaint, or that the offenses are from a single arrest and charge. Vasquez counters that Section 7508 does not indicate that a defendant would be subject to an enhanced sentence because of a multiple count offense. Here, his guilty pleas occurred in the same proceeding, were a result of one warrant and one complaint for the sale of drugs to the same undercover officer. Vasquez argues that the case is distinguishable from Plass and Williams because in those cases there were two separate offenses, with two separate arrests. Vasquez also seems vaguely to imply that these two drug offenses are part of a single criminal episode and thus cannot be considered separate convictions for purposes of the enhancement statute. While Vasquez appears to argue that we should treat this single indictment and arrest as a single conviction for purposes of the enhancement statute, he does not present any record facts or any language in the statute to support this assertion.\nHis drug transactions were distinct in time, occurring ten days apart and requiring separate planning and execution. There is no evidence in the record before us that the transactions were contingent upon each other. They should not be treated as a single criminal act simply because the transactions involved sales to the same undercover officer. Thus, the facts properly support the conclusion that we are confronted with two convictions for two separate crimes, although contained within one indictment and one arrest. Moreover, even if we were to conclude that these transactions could be construed as a single criminal episode, the statute at issue specifically focuses on a defendant\u2019s prior \u201cconvictions\u201d at the time of sentencing, and makes no distinction between convictions that arise from a multiple count complaint, or a separate complaint. We are bound by the unambiguous language of the statute and cannot read language into it that simply does not appear. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(b). The wording of the statute is unambiguous, and clearly requires that as long as at the time of sentencing, a defendant \u201chas been convicted\u201d of another qualifying \u201coffense,\u201d the defendant shall receive the enhanced sentence.\nMoreover, this matter is not significantly different from our decision in Williams, where the defendant committed a drug offense in November of 1988 and another drug offense in May of 1991. On October 11, 1991 Williams pled guilty to both offenses and was sentenced for both offenses on November 26, 1991. The issue raised in Williams was whether the defendant was subject to the enhanced sentencing provision of Section 7508, the same provision at issue here. We stated that:\nThe legislation in question contains no ambiguity at all. It says that \u2018if at the time of sentencing the defendant has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense;\u2019 he must receive an enhanced sentence. Appellant asks that we interpret the word \u2018sentencing\u2019 in the statute to mean \u2018committing the offense for which the defendant is being sentenced,\u2019 so that the statute would read \u2018if, at the time of committing the offense for which the defendant is sentenced, the defendant has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense,\u2019 he must receive an enhanced sentence. Appellant\u2019s request is beyond our power. Where there is no ambiguity, there is no room for interpretation.\nWilliams, 652 A.2d at 285 (emphasis added). We find that the reasoning employed in Williams applies here. In Williams and the instant case, defendants pled guilty to two crimes, and the sentencing judge simultaneously imposed sentences for each conviction. Like Williams, we are confronted with the same legislation, which states that, \u201cif at the time of sentencing the defendant has been convicted of another drug trafficking offense,\u201d he must receive an enhanced sentence. Section 7508(a)(3). Vasquez asks that we read the statute either to treat a multiple count complaint as one conviction or alternatively to require that his two offenses be separated by an intervening arrest. However, as we stated in Williams, this request is beyond our power. \u201cWhere there is no ambiguity, there is no room for interpretation.\u201d Id.\nIn this way, the statute is substantially similar to the federal enhancement provision applicable to crimes committed while using a firearm, set forth at 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C). Section 924(c)(1)(C) states, in relevant part, that in the case of a \u201csecond or subsequent conviction under this subsection\u201d a defendant \u201cshall be\u201d subject to an enhanced sentence. Id. In interpreting this section as it applies to convictions contained within a single criminal complaint, both the United States Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit have held that this provision makes no distinction between convictions contained within one indictment or arising from separate judgments. Deal v. United States, 508 U.S. 129, 113 S.Ct 1993, 124 L.Ed.2d 44 (1993); United States v. Casiano, 113 F.3d 420 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 887, 118 S.Ct. 221, 139 L.Ed.2d 155 (1997).\nIn Deal, the defendant was charged in one indictment for six armed robberies that he committed between January and April of 1990. The criminal complaint contained six counts and he was convicted on all of them. Pursuant to the provisions of Section 924(c)(1)(C), the Supreme Court concluded that the district court properly enhanced defendant\u2019s sentence for counts two through six because these convictions were \u201csubsequent convictions\u201d pursuant to the unambiguous statute, even though they were contained in a single criminal complaint. 508 U.S. at 130-31, 113 S.Ct. 1993. In Casiano, defendants, in a single indictment, were charged with five felony counts arising from a single car jacking and kidnapping of a priest. Defendants pled guilty to all charges. The district court sentenced each of the defendants pursuant to the enhancement provisions of Section 924(c)(1)(C), concluding that two of the counts against them were \u201csubsequent convictions.\u201d The Third Circuit affirmed and rejected defendants\u2019 argument that because the criminal course of conduct was continuous and involved the same victim, all of the counts were one criminal episode and thus, could not count as a second or subsequent conviction under Section 924(c)(1). In so holding, the Third Circuit stated that defendants:\npoint to nothing in the language of the statute to support their statutory construction and our searching inquiry has uncovered no support for their position. The statute speaks in terms of \u2018convictions,\u2019 not criminal episode.\nIn order to adopt defendant\u2019s argument, we would have to limit the statutory language \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d conviction to exclude a conviction that arises out of the same criminal episode involving the same victim. Defendants would have us insert words in the statute, which simply are not there.\n* * *\nJust as the Supreme Court in Deal declined to differentiate between convictions embodied in separate judgments and those embodied in separate charges in the same indictment, so also we cannot distinguish between criminal acts that occur over a period of time and/or affect various victims and those that result from the same course of criminal activity.\n113 F.3d at 424.\nAkin to the issue presented in Deal and Casiano, we can not read into the statute a requirement that is not present. No where in the unambiguous language of Section 7508 does the statute require an analysis of when the convictions occurred or whether an intervening arrest occurred between the commission of these drug offenses. By placing either requirement into the statute, we would inappropriately change the relevant inquiry for the imposition of the enhancement. The statute could not be clearer that the sentencing judge looks back only from the time of sentencing to determine if there is a previous conviction that can be used to enhance the offender\u2019s sentence. The statute does not allow that judge to determine whether the convictions occurred within the same proceeding or whether the underlying offenses were punctuated by intervening arrests. Accordingly, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court and remand this matter to it for consideration of the constitutional challenges raised by Vasquez.\nJustice CAPPY files a Concurring Opinion; Justice NIGRO files a Dissenting Opinion.\n. The Superior Court noted that \u201c[b]ecause of our conclusion that the sentence enhancement provisions of \u00a7 7508 are inapplicable to the present case it is not necessary that we attend [Vasquez\u2019s] constitutional challenges.\u201d 726 A.2d 396, 400 n. 9."}
