{"id": "993262", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWhile the court below gave no reason for refusing fo open the judgment against the appellant, it is safe to assume that her petition was dismissed because it appeared from the depositions that she had given her obligation to the appellee as an original undertaking on her part, for a valuable consideration passing directly to her, and not for an antecedent debt of her husband. It is for this reason that the appeal is dismissed with costs."}
