{"id": "941898", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe agreement upon which the plaintiffs\u2019 title is founded cannot reasonably be construed as more than a personal license. Though called by the parties a sale the vendee is \u201c not to sell any coal only what he hauls himself or have hauled,\u201d and he is also restricted from selling the \u201c said three acres of coal to any person or persons but Jas. M. Linn (the vendor) his heirs or assigns.\u201d The words of the grant are in present\u00ed, the description of the land complete, and the -receipt is of the consideration money in full. There is no indication of any further instrument being in contemplation, and the restrictions in this one are incompatible with a conveyance in fee, but \"entirely in harmony with a personal license.\nBut even if considered as a conveyance there are no words of inheritance and on the death of the grantee nothing passed to his heirs.\nJudgment affirmed."}
