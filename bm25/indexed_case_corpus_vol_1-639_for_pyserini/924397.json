{"id": "924397", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe evidence submitted in this case was not sufficient to establish the existence of the alleged nuncupative will of the deceased. This plainly appears in the elaborate and satisfactory opinion of the learned judge of the court below. The decision of the register of wills refusing to revoke letters of administration on the estate of the decedent and denying admission to probate of the alleged nuncupative will is therefore sustained and the appeal is dismissed."}
