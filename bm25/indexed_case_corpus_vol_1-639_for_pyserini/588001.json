{"id": "588001", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice LAMB.\nThis appeal presents a question of first impression: whether the Minority Tolling Statute, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5533(b), is applicable to a claim for benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act). For the reasons that follow, we hold that it is not and reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.\nIn November of 1983, Irvin East (Decedent) became disabled as a result of a work-related injury he sustained while employed by Appellant, USX Corporation (Employer). In April of 1985, Decedent died as a result of his injury. Pursuant to an Agreement for Compensation for Death (Agreement), Employer paid dependent death benefits to Decedent\u2019s wife, Joan Green, and son, Irvin K. East. Employer ceased paying benefits to Irvin K. East on his eighteenth birthday on April 28,1989, and to Joan Green upon her death on September 12,1993.\nOn April 20, 1998, Appellee, Sarah Sanders (Claimant), filed a Review Petition, requesting that death benefits pursuant to the Agreement be paid to her minor son, Bradley Irvin East, whom Claimant alleged was fathered by Decedent. Employer filed an Answer, denying that Decedent had any dependent children entitled to compensation benefits and asserting that the claim was time-barred by Section 315 of the Act because Claimant\u2019s Review Petition was filed more than three years after Employer made its last benefit payment pursuant to the Agreement.\nUpon request of the parties, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge (WCJ) agreed to bifurcate the proceedings and first decide the issue of whether Claimant\u2019s Review Petition was timely filed. Before the WCJ, Claimant acknowledged that the Review Petition was filed outside of the time required by Section 315 of the Act, but asserted that her minor son\u2019s rights were preserved by operation of the Minority Tolling Statute.\nOn October 6, 1999, the WCJ issued a decision and order denying Claimant\u2019s Review Petition. The WCJ found that the time limitations set forth in the Act are not tolled by the Minority Tolling Statute. The WCJ reasoned that because workers\u2019 compensation proceedings are not civil actions, the Minority Tolling Statute does not apply.\nClaimant appealed to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Board), which affirmed the decision of the WCJ. The Board reasoned that:\nthe Minority Tolling Statute specifically states that it applies to an individual entitled to bring a civil action. Workers\u2019 Compensation cases are not civil actions, but administrative actions brought under administrative courts, not civil courts. This conclusion is supported by the well established rule of law that the rules of civil procedure are not applicable to workmen\u2019s compensation cases before a referee or Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board. Ace Tire Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Hand), 101 Pa. Cmwlth. 186, 515 A.2d 1020 (Pa.Cmwlth.1986).\nWorkers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board slip op. at 5 (italics in original).\nThe Commonwealth Court reversed the order of the Board and remanded to the WCJ for a determination of whether Bradley Irvin East is Decedent\u2019s son and therefore entitled to benefits under the Act. East v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Bd. (USX Corp./Clairton), 786 A.2d 1044 (Pa.Cmwlth. 2001). In construing the meaning of the term \u201ccivil action\u201d, as used in the Minority Tolling Statute, the Commonwealth Court relied on its previous opinion in State Bd. of Dentistry v. Weltman, 168 Pa.Cmwlth. 197, 649 A.2d 478 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1994):\nThe accepted meaning of \u201ccivil,\u201d which precedes and restricts the meaning of \u201caction,\u201d means \u201crelating to private rights and remedies sought by civil actions as contrasted with criminal proceedings.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 222 (5th ed.1979). The terms individually and together include actions in equity and distinguish criminal proceedings.\nEast, 786 A.2d at 1048 (quoting Weltman, 649 A.2d at 479). Following its analysis in Weltman, the Commonwealth Court determined that the phrase \u201ccivil action\u201d, as used in the Minority Tolling Statute, merely distinguishes non-criminal matters and that even though workers\u2019 compensation proceedings are administrative in nature, they are non-criminal actions and therefore within the definition of a civil action. East, 786 A.2d at 1048-49. The Commonwealth Court therefore held that the Minority Tolling Statute is applicable to workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. Id. at 1049.\nWe granted allocatur to determine whether a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding is a \u201ccivil action\u201d, as that term is used in the Minority Tolling Statute. Oral argument was heard on March 3, 2003.\nThe scope of appellate review in workers\u2019 compensation proceedings is limited to a determination of whether constitutional rights have been violated, an error of law has been committed, or the findings of fact are unsupported by substantial evidence. Lykins v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd. (New Castle Foundry), 552 Pa. 1, 713 A.2d 77, 78 (Pa.1998).\nOn appeal to this Court, Employer claims that the Commonwealth Court erred in determining that workers\u2019 compensation proceedings are civil actions. Employer argues that workers\u2019 compensation actions are administrative actions with administrative remedies that must be exhausted before civil remedies may be pursued. Employer points out that workers\u2019 compensation proceedings are not governed by the strict pleading rules of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, but are instead governed by administrative law and procedure. Finally, Employer contends that if the General Assembly had intended to include all non-criminal actions under the protection of the Minority Tolling Statute, it would have done so explicitly, by including the words \u201cnon-criminal action\u201d instead of \u201ccivil action\u201d, or by adding the words \u201cor any administrative action\u201d.\nWe agree with Employer that workers\u2019 compensation proceedings are administrative actions, distinct from civil actions. In promulgating the Act, the Legislature replaced an employee\u2019s right to file a civil action in the nature of a tort claim against his employer with an administrative action in the form of workers\u2019 compensation proceedings, in which the employee gives up non-economic damages in return for relief from the burden of proving negligence. See Dolan v. Linton\u2019s Lunch, 397 Pa. 114, 152 A.2d 887, 889 (Pa.1959) (\u201cThe [Act] provides for compensation without resort to a suit at law in all cases of injuries to employees arising from accidents in the course of employment. It provides for compensation in such cases even though the employer was not negligent and the employee was.\u201d); Rudy v. McCloskey & Co., 152 Pa.Super. 101, 30 A.2d 805, 808 (Pa.Super.1943) (stating that the Act\u2019s \u201cpurpose was to provide recompense commensurate with the damage from accidental injury, as a fair exchange for relinquishing every other right of action against the employer.\u201d), aff'd per curiam on the basis of the opinion of the lower court, 348 Pa. 401, 35 A.2d 250 (Pa.1944).\nIn Pennsylvania, workers\u2019 compensation proceedings are distinct and separate from civil actions. The two have different substantive and procedural provisions and remedies. The tribunals vested with original and initial appellate jurisdiction are likewise distinct. In enacting the Act, the Legislature replaced what was previously a civil action with a statutorily prescribed comprehensive administrative system of substantive, procedural, and remedial laws, which provide the exclusive forum for redress of injuries in any way related to the work place. See Shick v. Shirey, 552 Pa. 590, 716 A.2d 1281, 1237 (Pa.1998) (The Act \u201cis the exclusive means for obtaining compensation for injuries which has been substituted for common law tort actions between employees and employers.\u201d) (emphasis added) (citing Kachinski v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., 516 Pa. 240, 532 A.2d 374 (Pa. 1987)); Blake v. Wilson, 268 Pa. 469, 112 A. 126, 128 (Pa. 1920) (\u201cAll will agree that [the Act\u2019s] primary and general purpose was to substitute a method of accident insurance in place of common law rights and liabilities for substantially all employees, except such as are by express terms or necessary implication excluded from its operation.\u201d) (emphasis added). As aptly stated by the United States Supreme Court:\nHistorically, workmen\u2019s compensation statutes were the offspring of a desire to give injured workers a quicker and more certain recovery than can be obtained from tort suits based on negligence and subject to common-law defenses to such suits. Thus compensation laws are practically always thought of as substitutes for, not supplements to, common-law tort actions. A series of comparatively recent cases in this Court has recognized this historic truth and ruled accordingly. Johansen v. United States, 343 U.S. 427, 72 S.Ct. 849, 96 L.Ed. 1051 [(1952)], and Patterson v. United States, 359 U.S. 495, 79 S.Ct. 936, 3 L.Ed.2d 971 [(1959)], for instance, are typical of the recognition by this Court that the right of recovery granted groups of workers covered by such compensation laws is exclusive.\nUnited States v. Demko, 385 U.S. 149, 151, 87 S.Ct. 382, 17 L.Ed.2d 258 (1966) (emphasis added).\nLegislative authority to enact workers\u2019 compensation laws in this Commonwealth rests upon Article III, Section 18 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. In a significant, constitutional sense, workers\u2019 compensation proceedings are sui generis. By force of Article III, Section 18, the Legislature is empowered, in the context of workplace injuries, to create proceedings and to limit recoveries that, in any other context, would be beyond its legitimate authority. This power has been implemented by the Act. As we have noted, the uniquely detailed substantive and procedural provisions of the Act pertaining to employees\u2019 benefits on account of workplace injuries and resulting disability, replace traditional common law rights and remedies. These traditional rights and remedies were previously the subject of civil actions. Their legislative replacement is of a different origin and nature, being an administrative scheme having some characteristics of risk spreading similar to programs of insurance and other characteristics uniquely designed to serve social policy interests. Such social programs were unknown at common law. In the Act, they are expressly charged, in the matter of original jurisdiction, to quasi-judicial tribunals \u2014 not to any court.\nClaimant points out that it is well settled that the Act is remedial legislation, subject to a liberal construction to effectuate the Act\u2019s purpose of benefiting injured workers and their dependents. Claimant argues that since neither the Judicial Code nor the Minority Tolling Statute itself define \u201ccivil action\u201d, in light of the remedial purposes of the Act and the Minority Tolling Statute, \u201ccivil action\u201d should be interpreted to include workers\u2019 compensation proceedings.\nWhile Claimant is correct that the Legislature has failed to specifically define the term \u201ccivil action\u201d, the term appears in more than five hundred separate legislative provisions. While the parties have provided no assistance in the task, our examination of each of these has revealed persuasive evidence that the Legislature uses the term in a way that does not encompass proceedings before the workers\u2019 compensation authorities. Most revealing in this regard are those provisions in which \u201ccivil actions\u201d are expressly distinguished from \u201cadministrative proceedings\u201d, thereby demonstrating that the former excludes the latter. The majority of these statutory exemplars express the understanding that \u201ccivil actions\u201d are those commenced and conducted in a court of record, involving traditional common law claims for damages or equitable relief governed by the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.\nSection 761 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(a)(1), vests in the Commonwealth Court original jurisdiction of all \u201ccivil actions or proceedings\u201d against the \u201cCommonwealth government\u201d with five enumerated exceptions. \u201cCommonwealth government\u201d is defined in 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 101. Original jurisdiction over workers\u2019 compensation claims naming a Commonwealth government employer as a defendant, in contrast, is vested in the WCJ. See 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 701, 710. Therefore, the term \u201ccivil action\u201d, as used in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(a)(1), does not include workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. In fact, an attempt to interpret the Legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201ccivil action\u201d as including workers\u2019 compensation claims and proceedings produces an absurd result in many instances.\nFinally, we do not agree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s reliance on Black\u2019s Law Dictionary for the proposition that an action is either civil or criminal. See East, 786 A.2d at 1048-49 (quoting Weltman, 649 A.2d at 479). Although workers\u2019 compensation proceedings are admittedly non-criminal, that fact alone does not dictate that workers\u2019 compensation proceedings are therefore civil actions. Furthermore, the Weltman case was, in fact, an equity action brought in the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, which neither raised nor decided the issue of whether administrative actions, such as those created by the Act, are civil actions. See Weltman, 649 A.2d at 478-79.\nAccordingly, we hold that a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding is not a \u201ccivil action\u201d, as that term is used in the Minority Tolling Statute. We must therefore conclude that the Minority Tolling Statute is not applicable to workers\u2019 compensation proceedings. Pursuant to Section 315 of the Act, Claimant\u2019s Review Petition is time-barred.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the order of Board, affirming the WCJ\u2019s denial of Claimant\u2019s Review Petition, is reinstated.\nJustice NIGRO concurs in the result.\n. At the lime here relevant, Section 5533(b) read as follows:\n\u00a7 5533. Infancy, insanity or imprisonment\n(b) Infancy. \u2014 If an individual entitled to bring a civil action is an unemancipated minor at the time the cause of action accrues, the period of minority shall not be deemed a portion of the time period within which the action must be commenced. Such person shall have the same time for commencing an action after attaining majority as is allowed to others by the provisions of this subchapter. As used in this subchapter the term \"minor\u201d shall mean any individual who has not yet attained the age of 18.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5533(b). Section 5533 was amended by Act 86 of 2002 (S.B.212), \u00a7 1. Pursuant to the amendments, Section 5533(b) was separated into Sections 5533(b)(l)(i) and 5533(b)(ii), and a new Section 5533(b)(2) was added. The addition of Section 5533(b)(2) is not here material.\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1041.1, 2501-2626. Until 1993, the Act was known as the Workmen's Compensation Act. It was renamed the Workers' Compensation Act by the Act of July 2, 1993, P.L. 190, commonly known as \"Act 44\u201d.\n.
