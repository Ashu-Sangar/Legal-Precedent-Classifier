{"id": "880497", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nBy agreement filed, trial by jury was waived, and the case was submitted to the learned president of the common pleas. An examination of the record has failed to convince us that there is any substantial error either in his findings of fact or conclusions of law; and there appears to be nothing in either of the specifications of error that requires discussion. They are all dismissed, and the judgment is affirmed, on the opinion of the court below."}
