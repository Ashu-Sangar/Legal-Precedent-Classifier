{"id": "956160", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe plaintiff, a child eight and a half years old, started to cross the street, not at a public crossing, and met a wagon, which drew up to let her pass, and immediately beyond she was struck by the defendant\u2019s wagon, going in the same direction. There was no evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence except the child\u2019s expression that the horse flew past \u201clike a bird. \u201d It would be unsafe to base a verdict on anything so indefinite.\nJudgment affirmed."}
