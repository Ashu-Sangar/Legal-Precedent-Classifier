{"id": "1225561", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania commenced this action against Charles Hicks, defendant, to recover the sum of $2770 paid to defendant as a blind man\u2019s pension. The Commonwealth\u2019s sole contention is that under \u00a79 (c) of the Public Assistance Law defendant is not entitled to such pension because he possesses tangible assets in the form of bank deposits in excess of $5000. The learned court below held that the $5000 limit imposed by \u00a79(c) applied only to real estate and accordingly entered judgment for defendant. From that judgment the Conflfnonwealth has now appealed.\nThe language of the Act here pertinent provides that \u201cany blind person having real property with an assessed valuation of over five thousand dollars ($5000), is not entitled to such pension.\u201d The Commonwealth argues that \u201creal property\u201d as used therein is not intended to be limited to real estate but rather is to include all tangible assets. In the face of the well established and clearly defined meaning in our law of the term \u201creal property\u201d such an argument is untenable. For it is axiomatic that words having a precise and well-settled legal meaning must be given that meaning when they appear in statutes unless there is a clear expression of legislative intent to the contrary: Smrekar v. J. & L. Steel Corp., 137 Pa. Superior Ct. 183, 191, 8 A. 2d 461. That no such intent is here present is obvious from the use of' the phrase \u201cassessed valuation\u201d. In this Common - wealth real estate alone is normally given an assessed valuation. Therefore, by using that term the legislature clearly indicated that it intended to include only realty. Since defendant does not possess real estate with an assessed value of more than $5000 the court below correctly ruled that he is entitled to his pension.\nJudgment affirmed.\nAct of June 24, 1937, P. L. 2051, as amended."}
