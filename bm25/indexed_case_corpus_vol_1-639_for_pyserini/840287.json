{"id": "840287", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe think the court below was right in entering judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. The magistrate had the right to take the recognizance, and the short entry of \u201c Recognizance forfeited, May 5, 1891,\u201d is conclusive in this case that the defendant and the bail were called and did not appear.\nJudgment affirmed."}
