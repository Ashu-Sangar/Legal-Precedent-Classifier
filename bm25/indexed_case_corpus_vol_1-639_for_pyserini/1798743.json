{"id": "1798743", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPAPADAKOS, Justice.\nLawrence Christy was found guilty by a jury of murder of the first degree for the killing of James Volk. A sentencing hearing was held as required by 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711 and the jury determined that Lawrence Christy be sentenced to death.\nThe case is now before us on automatic appeal pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(1).\nThe facts of the case are as follows: According to Appellant\u2019s own testimony, in the early morning hours of June 16, 1980, he left a friend\u2019s house and decided that he was going to rob the Italian Men\u2019s Society Club in Gallitzan, Cambria County. He went there but found that he could not gain entry. He then went to the Oriental Ballroom and \u201cjimmied\u201d open a window with a knife and went inside. He was unaware that the Oriental Ballroom had a night watchman.\nOnce inside, he proceeded to go down the side of the ballroom towards the bar area when he heard footsteps coming from that direction. Appellant hid under a table until the sound of the footsteps became inaudible, indicating that the person had left the area. Appellant then came out from underneath the table and decided to leave the premises when he heard the footsteps again coming through the barroom. At that point, Appellant stated that he jumped up and put his hands in the air and said, \u201cI give up.\u201d According to Appellant, the person then said, \u201cYou son of a bitch hippie,\u201d and shot at Appellant, striking him on the wrist and knocking him to the floor. That person was 69-year old James Volk, the security guard at the Oriental Ballroom. According to Appellant, Mr. Volk then placed the gun on the bar and started walking towards the end of the bar. Appellant then jumped up and grabbed the gun from the bar. Mr. Volk turned around and started to run toward Appellant.\nAppellant testified as follows:\nI picked up the gun. He came running at me. I said, please don\u2019t. Don\u2019t. And I shot once and didn\u2019t know if I hit him or not. He kept on coming like a racing bull. I shot him again and he fell down.\n... [H]e was on his knees and he was choking and gagging. I stepped around and I said why, why, and I shot him in his head because to me I felt that he was dying and I didn\u2019t want ... to me he was suffering.\nAppellant then took Mr. Volk\u2019s wallet and left.\nLawrence Christy confessed to the murder both in an interview with Pennsylvania State Trooper Cimbalista and again on the witness stand during trial.\nThe jury found Appellant guilty of murder of the first degree. At the sentencing hearing, the jury determined that Appellant be sentenced to death after finding two aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances. The aggravating circumstances were that the victim was a prosecution witness to a murder or other felony committed by the defendant, and was killed for the purpose of preventing his testimony against the defendant in any grand jury or criminal proceedings involving such offenses; and the defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony.\nAppellant\u2019s first argument on appeal is that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Appellant\u2019s court-appointed trial counsel presented a defense that the first two shots fired by Appellant were in self-defense and that the last shot was fired as a result of the diminished capacity of Appellant. Appellant's new counsel for this appeal argues that this defense was unreasonable and that as a result of trial counsels\u2019 inexperience, they failed \u201cto recognize that the only viable defense was psychiatric.\u201d\nWe disagree that trial counsel were ineffective. When confronted with a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a reviewing court must first ascertain whether the issue underlying the charge of ineffectiveness is of arguable merit and, if so, it must be determined whether the course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to serve the interests of his client. Commonwealth v. Stoyko, 504 Pa. 455, 475 A.2d 714 (1984); Commonwealth v. Wade, 501 Pa. 331, 461 A.2d 613 (1983); Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687 (1977). There is a presumption in law that counsel is effective. Commonwealth v. Miller, 494 Pa. 229, 431 A.2d 233 (1981). The standard governing ineffectiveness claims was set forth by this Court in Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A.2d 349 (1967):\nOur inquiry ceases and counsel\u2019s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests. The test is not whether other alternatives were more reasonable, employing a hindsight evaluation of the record. Although weigh the alternatives we must, the balance tips in favor of a finding of effective assistance as soon as it is determined that the trial counsel\u2019s decision had any reasonable basis.\nId., 427 Pa. at 604, 235 A.2d at 352-53. We also noted in Maroney that:\n... for relief to be granted, Appellant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness worked to his prejudice____\nCommonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, supra, 427 Pa. at 605, n. 8, 235 A.2d at 353, n. 8. See also, Commonwealth v. Bandy, 494 Pa. 244, 431 A.2d 240 (1981). The Supreme Court of the United States has established the same standard pursuant to federal constitutional strictures in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) reh. den., 467 U.S. 1267, 104 S.Ct. 3562, 82 L.Ed.2d 864.\nAn error by counsel, even if professionally unreasonable, does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment____ Accordingly, any deficiencies in counsel\u2019s performance must be prejudicial to the defense in order to constitute ineffective assistance under the Constitution. Id., 466 U.S. at 691-92, 104 S.Ct. at 2067, 80 L.Ed.2d at 696.\nFurther, counsel will not be considered ineffective for failure to assert a meritless claim. Stoyko, supra, 504 Pa. at 472, 475 A.2d at 723.\nWith the Maroney standard in mind, we will address Appellant\u2019s itemized list of ineffectiveness.\nAppellant argues on appeal that trial counsel were ineffective for failing to retain a \u201cdefense oriented\u201d psychiatrist to testify at trial.\nThe record of this case reveals that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel did earnestly pursue the option of insanity as a possible defense. The matter was raised in an Omnibus Pre-trial Motion for Relief filed by Appellant\u2019s trial attorneys. The omnibus motion contained inter alia a notice of insanity defense and a motion for a psychiatric examination. The court issued an order directing that Appellant be examined at Farview State Hospital. The court directed that the psychiatric evaluation determine the following:\nthe defendant\u2019s capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him;\nthe defendant\u2019s capacity to comprehend his own condition from such proceedings;\nthe defendant\u2019s capacity to understand the nature of the punishment which might be inflicted upon him;\nthe defendant\u2019s capacity to confer with counsel in reference to such proceedings;\nthe defendant\u2019s capacity to make a rational defense;\nthe probable effect of the trial on the defendant\u2019s physical and mental condition; and\nwhether the defendant, at the time of the commission of the act, was laboring under such defect of reason or from diseased mind as not to know the nature and quality of the acts he was doing or, if he did understand the nature and quality of his acts, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.\nThe examination of Appellant addressed itself to the questions posed by the court. Following the examination, the court issued subpoenas for the individuals who had conducted the examination, particularly Dr. Edward Olivier, and a summary of the evaluation was read into the record by the court as follows:\nThe patient is judged to have no functional mental illness and no significant mental disability. His characterologic and personality problems are severe and are considered to be totally resistant to modifications through any known form of treatment. He is considered to be entirely competent to stand trial and to cooperate with his attorney in the preparation of his defense. The patient is not considered to need further hospitalization and it is recommended that he be returned to the Cambria County Jail.\nI could find no evidence whatsoever, either from the subject or from other sources, to suggest that he was not responsible under the M\u2019Naghten Rules.\nAfter the court stated that, in its opinion, the matter was settled, defense counsel requested the following:\nMR. PARSEGHIAN: Your Honor, as to the matter of the insanity defense. I believe we are going to, in the interest of protecting our client\u2019s rights, have to call the examining physician and subject him to cross-examination and to determine whether or not, based on Mr. Christy\u2019s past history of involvement with illicit substances, he might have, at that point in time, been subject to a diminished capacity to understand what the nature and quality of his action was. I understand what the basis of the doctor\u2019s report is, but I would like to question him about it as to what sources he relied upon.\nThere was reference in there to reports from Hollidaysburg State Hospital and other facilities at which Mr. Christy was treated, but I believe the previous Farview record might not have been given due consideration and we would like to question the doctor as to exactly what was considered, what tests were performed, and what if any discussion was had with Mr. Christy pertaining to his use of drugs and other substances at the time of the offense in question. So we will have to pursue this defense, Your Honor.\nThe Court granted this request. However, Dr. Olivier was unable to appear for examination, and the court, on its own motion and with notice to the Commonwealth and defense counsel, ordered that the Appellant be examined by Dr. Hugh E. Chavern, a psychiatrist in Greensburg, Pennsylvania. The court directed that Dr. Chavern examine Appellant regarding the same questions posed to Dr. Olivier, including, again, the question of whether, at the time of the commission of the act, Appellant was laboring under such defect of reason, from disease of mind, as not to know the nature and quality of his acts, or if he did know what he was doing, did not know that it was wrong.\nCopies of Dr. Chavern\u2019s report were given to both the Commonwealth and defense. A hearing was held in court in the form of a competency hearing with Dr. Chavern testifying and answering questions posed by the court, the prosecution, and both defense attorneys.\nDr. Chavern testified that, in his opinion, Appellant was not laboring under any defect of reason or disease of mind at the time he committed the crimes for which he was arrested. This opinion was based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\nDr. Chavern also stated that, in his opinion, based on a reasonable degree of medical certainty, Appellant was competent to stand trial, able to deal with his attorney, understand the nature of the charges against him, and assist his counsel in making a rational defense. Defense counsel cross-examined Dr. Chavern extensively. Dr. Chavern testified at the competency hearing that he had testified for both the prosecution and defense in the past, and stated that he thought that, in the preponderance of instances, he had testified for the defense.\nA hearing on the Motion for New Trial and In Arrest of Judgment was held on May 22, 1984, before the trial judge, the Honorable Eugene A. Creany. Testifying on the issue of ineffectiveness of counsel, defense attorney Parseghian stated that he had had contact with Dr. Chavern during the time he was a law clerk for the Honorable Caram J. Abood of the Cambria County Common Pleas bench. Attorney Parseghian had seen the doctor\u2019s work, seen him testify, and found him to be objective. In addition, he felt that Dr. Chavern, being from Greensburg, would be removed from the case.\nFor these reasons, defense counsel felt that he would give an objective opinion of the Appellant. Based on Dr. Chavern\u2019s report and testimony, as well as the report of Dr. Olivier, Appellant\u2019s trial attorneys decided not to pursue the insanity defense. We find no evidence of ineffectiveness in their decision.\nIn Commonwealth v. Martinez, 498 Pa. 387, 446 A.2d 899 (1982), we held that failure to mount an insanity defense did not constitute ineffectiveness where counsel considered the issue carefully and rejected it.\nA decision by counsel not to take a particular action does not constitute ineffectiveness if it is based upon a reasonable conclusion that there will be no benefit, and is not the result of sloth or ignorance of available alternatives. Commonwealth v. Blair, 491 Pa. 499, 421 A.2d 656 (1980). See also, Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 485 Pa. 353, 402 A.2d 999 (1979).\nFurthermore, we have held that \u201ca finding of ineffectiveness can never be made unless it can be concluded that the alternatives not chosen offered a potential for success substantially greater than the tactics actually utilized.\u201d Commonwealth v. Bandy, 494 Pa. 244, 431 A.2d 240 (1981); Commonwealth ex. rel, Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 605 n. 8, 235 A.2d 349, 353 n. 8 (1967). Appellant does not allege that there existed any alternatives which offered greater success than the one chosen.\nAdditionally, we have made an independent review of the entire record and conclude that there were no alternatives which offered a potential for success greater than that utilized.\nAnother argument by Appellant concerning the ineffective assistance of counsel claim is that trial counsel were ineffective for allowing evidence of Appellant\u2019s prior incarcerations to be heard by the jury. Appellant specifically complains of two instances. The first involved the cross-examination of Commonwealth witness Robert DeRose by Defense Attorney Rulis.\nMR. RULIS: \u201cHow long have you known Larry? You stated for two years, I believe, is that correct?\u201d\nMR. DeROSE: \u201cIt\u2019s been a few years.\u201d\nMR. RULIS: \u201cWould you consider him a friend?\u201d\nMR. DeROSE: \u201cAn acquaintance.\u201d\nMR. RULIS: \u201cHow were you an acquaintance of Larry Christy? How did that develop?\u201d\nMR. DeROSE: \u201cI met him up here in Ebensburg.\u201d\nMR. RULIS: \u201cHow did you meet him?\u201d\nMR. DeROSE: \u201cIn the Cambria County \u2014\u201d\nMR. RULIS: \u201cHow did you meet him?\u201d\nMR. DeROSE: \u201cI was in there.\u201d\nMR. RULIS: \u201cExcuse me?\u201d\nMR. DeROSE: \u201cI was in there and he was in there.\u201d\nMR. RULIS: \u201cThe jail?\u201d\nMR. DeROSE: \u201cYes.\u201d\nMR. RULIS: \u201cNo further questions.\u201d\nAt the hearing on post-trial motions, the defense attorney explained that he wanted to show that the witness had been in jail in order to attack his credibility. Although the attorney should have been able to accomplish this without revealing that Appellant had also been in jail, we find no prejudice to the defense in this instance.\nThe defense brought out at trial Appellant\u2019s long history of placement in mental institutions due to life-long drug and alcohol abuse, including a suicide attempt in jail. The defense attempted to show that this history culminated in a diminished mental capacity under the stress of the moment of the crime. In attempting to do this, evidence of Appellant\u2019s prior incarcerations was heard by the jury.\nWe find that any error that existed by this course of action did not prejudice Appellant and had no effect on the judgment in this case or on the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Here, Appellant testified at trial that his victim was on his knees, choking on his own blood. He then stated that:\nI stepped around and I said why, why, and I shot him in his head because to me I felt that he was dying and I didn\u2019t want ... to me he was suffering.\nThus, Appellant admitted that the act of killing his victim was deliberate and premeditated. The defense attempted to establish that due to Appellant\u2019s diminished mental capacity at the time of the killing, he did not act willfully. The jury was justified in disbelieving this defense and finding that he did act willfully, deliberately, and with premeditation beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAt the sentencing hearing, the jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant had committed the killing while in the perpetration of a felony; Appellant admitted during testimony that he committed the killing while in the perpetration of a burglary. The jury found no mitigating circumstances. We conclude that Appellant received constitutionally effective assistance of counsel under the Maroney standard.\nAppellant also argues that defense counsel committed prejudicial error in failing to object to the following cross-examination:\nMR. KINIRY: \u201cSo you have never been taken off the street and put into one of these facilities, have you?\u201d\nLARRY CHRISTY: \u201cI can\u2019t remember if the Hollidaysburg one was.\u201d\nMR. KINIRY: \u201cWell, let\u2019s look when you went to Far-view. You were in where? What prison were you in then?\u201d\nLARRY CHRISTY: \u201cThe first time I was in Hunting-don.\u201d\nMR. KINIRY: \u201cIt\u2019s not too nice at Huntingdon, is it?\u201d\nLARRY CHRISTY: \u201cIt\u2019s not too nice in any prison.\u201d\nMR. KINIRY: \u201cThat is a good point, because every time you go to prison, you do something which gets you put into one of these mental hospitals or drug rehabilitation clinics; isn\u2019t that true?\nAnd when you spend your time in jail, you\u2019re in some kind of a hospital, it is a little nicer in the hospital than it is in the prison, isn\u2019t it, Larry?\u201d\nLARRY CHRISTY: \u201cA couple of them, yes.\u201d\nMR. KINIRY: \u201cA little maybe cleaner sheets and nicer beds and better food?\u201d\nLARRY CHRISTY: \u201cNo, not ...\u201d\nMR. KINIRY: \u201cNot the food, huh?\u201d\nLARRY CHRISTY: \u201cNot the food, no, especially Far-view.\u201d\nMR. KINIRY: \u201cWell, let\u2019s look at Farview. If you hadn\u2019t been in Farview those years you would have been sitting in Huntingdon, right?\u201d\nLARRY CHRISTY: \u201cHuntingdon or \u2014 \u201d\nMR. KINIRY: \u201cOr some other State Prison. But you get to stay in Farview and when your sentence was up they left you out, right?\u201d\nLARRY CHRISTY: \u201cWhen my sentence was up they moved me out of the hospital, yes.\u201d\nMR. KINIRY: \u201cYou got out?\u201d\nLARRY CHRISTY: \u201cAfter several different channels.\u201d\nMR. KINIRY: \u201cAnd so how many times have you been through these drug rehabilitation programs now, Larry?\u201d\nLARRY CHRISTY: \u201cI have been only through one drug rehabilitation center. I was told to go to other ones, but didn\u2019t go because of the times that I was in prison, when I did get out, I was only out 30 days, I went out high, stayed high until they caught me again.\u201d\nMR. KINIRY: \u201cSo that is the story of Larry Christy\u2019s life. You get in trouble. You go to jail. You don\u2019t like to be in jail, so, you do something to get you into the hospital. You serve your time. You get back out on the street. You do something bad. You go back into jail. You go back into the hospital. We can\u2019t rehabilitate you, can we, Larry?\u201d (Trial Transcript, Vol. 7, p. 27).\nAt the hearing on post-trial motions, defense counsel testified that he considered objecting, but felt that the questioning did not go beyond the scope of direct. We agree that defense counsel should have objected in this instance; however, we find no prejudice to Appellant by such failure. Maroney, supra.\nIn the instant case, we conclude that the factual findings were not affected by the failure of defense counsel to object to the above cross-examination. The entire evidentiary picture concerning the act of the killing was Appellant\u2019s testimony, in which he stated that he shot his victim in the back of the head with the intent to kill him. Therefore, the jury\u2019s conclusion that Appellant was guilty of murder of the first degree had overwhelming support in the record and, thus, was unaffected by this error of defense counsel.\nAppellant also argues that he was denied effective assistance of counsel due to the failure of his trial attorneys to develop a meaningful attorney-client relationship. This argument is without merit.\nIn Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983), it was held that there is no right to a meaningful attorney-client relationship. The Court stated:\nThe Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel \u201cwould be without substance if it did not include the right to a meaningful attorney-client relationship,\u201d 649 F.2d [718] at 720 [9th Cir.1981] (emphasis added), is without basis in the law. No authority was cited for this novel ingredient and of course none could be. No court could possibly guarantee that a defendant will develop the kind of rapport with his attorney \u2014 privately retained or provided by the public \u2014 that the Court of Appeals thought part of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel. Accordingly, we reject the claim that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d between an accused and his counsel.\nIn this regard, we note that the trial judge made the following comment on the record concerning trial counsels\u2019 conduct:\nTHE COURT: Mr. Christy, I have not had two lawyers who had solely by the petitions they have filed in your behalf exerted more effort in your behalf. And I feel that they have done an excellent job. They have even gone into matters which normally don\u2019t come to the attention of a Judge. For instance, you were in lock-up. They filed a petition to get you out of lock-up. You got out of lock-up. You wanted cigarettes and your candy or whatever it was, they exerted \u2014 because they came in and did that for you doesn\u2019t mean that they came in and told me stories about you or anybody else. They came in in your interest. And I think you got what you wanted.\nAppellant\u2019s next arguments concern the introduction, at the sentencing hearing, of evidence concerning two of the three aggravating circumstances. The three aggravating circumstances presented were: \u201cThe victim was a prosecution witness to a murder or other felony committed by the defendant and was killed for the purpose of preventing his testimony against the defendant in any grand jury or criminal proceedings involving such offenses\u201d (42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(5)); \u201cthe defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony\u201d (42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6)); and \u201cthe defendant has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person\u201d (42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9)).\nThe defense presented evidence of three mitigating circumstances, the first being that \u201cthe defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. 9711(e)(2). This, it was argued, was a result of years of drug and alcohol abuse. The defense also argued \u201cthe age of the defendant at the time of the crime,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(4); Appellant was thirty years old at the time of the crime. The defense also introduced evidence of the general character of Appellant in relation to 42 Pa.C.S. 9711(e)(8), \u201cany other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.\u201d\nThe jury rendered a verdict of death, finding two aggravating circumstances: the victim was a prosecution witness to a murder or other felony committed by defendant, and was killed for the purpose of preventing his testimony against the defendant in any grand jury or criminal proceedings involving such offenses; and the defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony. The jury found no mitigating circumstances.\nAppellant\u2019s first argument concerning the sentencing hearing concerns aggravating circumstance 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9). Over defense objection, the court permitted the prosecution to introduce evidence of Appellant\u2019s prior convictions on one charge of burglary and two escape charges as evidence attempting to establish that Appellant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the threat or use of violence to a person. No evidence was presented by the Commonwealth to show that these convictions involved the threat or use of violence to a person.\nAt the sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth argued that the inquiry here is whether \u201csomeone could have been seriously injured,\u201d equating the \u201cthreat of violence\u201d with the \u201cpotential for violence.\u201d The trial court erroneously agreed with this argument. In our view, the language of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9) is clear as to this point. It is the \u201cthreat of\u201d and not the \u201cpotential for\u201d violence that brings a crime into this category.\nForce is not an element of either of these crimes. Indeed, both crimes can be committed without even encountering another person. Every felony has the potential for violence if the actor is caught. This, however, is not what the Legislature intended by the words \u201cthreat of violence\u201d to the person. In order for a felony to be includable under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9), the Commonwealth must present evidence that the defendant actually threatened another with violence or actually used violence on another.\nThe evidence of the burglary and escape charges, as well as another conviction on two counts of aggravated assault, was presented to the jury in support of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9).\nThe jury, to its credit, however, did not find this aggravating circumstance. Therefore, the error committed by the trial court in submitting the evidence of the burglary and escape charges did not prejudice the defendant.\nAppellant\u2019s next argument concerns the jury\u2019s finding that Appellant\u2019s victim was a prosecution witness, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(5). Appellant argues that there was insufficient evidence to allow this circumstance to be presented to the jury and that the court\u2019s instruction as to this point was erroneous.\nThe Commonwealth argued at the sentencing hearing that Appellant had shot his victim the third and fatal time to prevent his being a witness against Appellant on the burglary charge. The court instructed, again over strenuous defense objection, that the jury must determine \u201cwhat his position would be as [a] witness against Mr. Christy----\u201d This is an erroneous interpretation of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(5).\nThis aggravating circumstance states:\nThe victim was a prosecution witness to a murder or other felony committed by the defendant and was killed for the purpose of preventing his testimony against the defendant in any grand jury proceeding or criminal proceeding involving such offenses.\nIn this case, there was no evidence to establish that Mr. Volk was, or ever would have been, a prosecution witness, or that Appellant killed him to prevent his testimony. The Commonwealth did present evidence by a Robert DeRose, who stated that Appellant, in a 1980 conversation, had made a general threat against any possible witnesses against him; however, this was not specific enough to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant killed Mr. Volk to prevent his testimony in a criminal proceeding.\nTherefore, we hold that aggravating circumstance five, as found by the jury in this case, was not supported by the evidence and must be stricken.\nThe jury did, however, find another aggravating circumstance which is fully supported by the evidence of record: the Appellant committed the killing while in the perpetration of a felony (42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6)). The felony was burglary. This is indisputable. Appellant admitted in both his statement to the police and on the witness stand at trial that he entered the building (an occupied structure) with the intent to commit a crime therein.\nFurthermore, he does not challenge the finding of this circumstance on appeal. We, as is our duty under the sentencing scheme, have reviewed the record, and have determined that the evidence clearly supports the finding of this aggravating circumstance.\nTherefore, since the jury found the presence of one aggravating circumstance and found no mitigating circumstances, the sentence of death is upheld even though another aggravating circumstance found by the jury is held invalid. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv) states:\n(iv) The verdict must be a sentence of death if the jury finds at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d) and no mitigating circumstance____\nIn Commonwealth v. Beasley, 504 Pa. 485, 475 A.2d 730 (1984), we held that:\nBecause the jury found at least one proper aggravating circumstance, viz. the killing of an on-duty police officer, and no mitigating circumstances, appellant\u2019s sentence of death was not only supported by evidence, but was required.\n504 Pa. 500, 475 A.2d at 738.\nTherefore, in the instant case, the death sentence will not be vacated on the ground that one of the aggravating circumstances found by the jury was invalidated.\nAppellant, lastly, argues that the death sentence imposed in this case was the product of passion, prejudice, and other arbitrary factors. It is submitted by Appellant that the trial court\u2019s erroneous interpretation and application of the Sentencing Code, defense counsels\u2019 ineffective assistance, and the Commonwealth\u2019s improper argument at the sentencing hearing, were individually and in their cumulative effect, of such a nature as to compel arbitrariness in the jury\u2019s exercise of its discretion.\nThe first two of these contentions have been addressed above. The third, concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s improper argument at the sentencing phase, will be discussed now. At the sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth made the following references in its closing argument:\nHe is so bad we can\u2019t keep him in jail____ [Larry Christy] is the Great Manipulator, because he can get and he can do whatever he wants again and again and again____ Close the door. Don\u2019t let it revolve____ The penalty must be death____ Does this mean he should go back? ... Where is the protective element? ... But just how long is for life____ If the law is the only thing that separates us from total destruction. You live by the law. Mr. Christy must die by the law____ Larry himself told you the system must not work____ You, Ladies and Gentlemen, are the final straw. The system didn\u2019t work____ Now we go down to grass roots____ Let your words ring out. Let your message be very clear to Larry Christy. You are not going to be another victim of the manipulator.\nIn Commonwealth v. Maxwell, 505 Pa. 152, 477 A.2d 1309 (1984), we held that \u201calthough a prosecutor\u2019s statement may be inappropriate, a new trial will not be granted unless it is inevitable that the prosecutor\u2019s remark prejudices the defendant to such a degree that it prevents the jury from weighing the evidence and rendering a true verdict.\u201d (Citing Commonwealth v. Upsher, 497 Pa. 621, 444 A.2d 90 (1982); See Commonwealth v. Burton, 491 Pa. 13, 417 A.2d 611 (1980)).\nIn Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 502 Pa. 474, 467 A.2d 288 (1983), we reviewed a claim of prosecutorial misconduct where the prosecutor stated, \u201cRight now, the score is John Lesko and Michael Travaglia two, society nothing. When will it stop? When is it going to stop? Who is going to make it stop? That\u2019s your duty.\u201d\nWe held that \u201cthe prosecution is permitted, by the terms of the statute, to argue in favor of the death penalty. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(a)(3). Taken in context, we find the prosecutor\u2019s comment to have been no more than permissible \u2018oratorical flair\u2019 in arguing in favor of the death penalty.\u201d 502 Pa. at 503, 467 A.2d at 302.\nIn the instant case, we find that the statements made by the prosecutor did not prejudice the finding of the aggravating circumstance that the killing had been committed while in the perpetration of a felony, which was conceded on appeal.\nAs is our duty under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h), we have carefully reviewed the sentence of death to determine whether it was the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor. We find no such evidence.\nFurthermore, as stated above, we find that the evidence fully supports the finding of an aggravating circumstance specified in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d). Finally, pursuant to our statutory obligation to review death cases to determine whether the imposed sentence of death is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,\u201d we have conducted an evaluation of all convictions of murder of the first degree prosecuted under the Act of September 13, 1978, P.L. 756, No. 141, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711, aided by the comprehensive study prepared at our order by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts. (See, Commonwealth v. Frey, 504 Pa. 428, 475 A.2d 700 (1984)). Our review reveals no excess or disproportionality in the sentence imposed in this case compared to the sentences imposed in other first degree murder cases where the evidence could support an aggravating circumstance, such as herein, with no mitigating circumstances.\nAffirmed.\nHUTCHINSON, J., files a concurring opinion.\nNIX, C.J., files a concurring and dissenting Opinion.\nZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nFLAHERTY, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(a)(1) provides:\n(a) Procedure in jury trials \u2014 (1) After a verdict of murder of the first degree is recorded and before the jury is discharged, the court shall conduct a separate sentencing hearing in which the jury shall determine whether the defendant shall be sentenced to death or life imprisonment.\n. Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(1), a sentence of death shall be subject to automatic review by this Court.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d): The victim was a prosecution witness to a murder or other felony committed by the defendant and was killed for the purpose of preventing his testimony against the defendant in any grand jury or criminal proceeding involving such offenses.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d). The defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony.\n. Appellant also argued that his trial counsel were ineffective for \u201cpermitting him to give the statement ultimately used against him.\" There is no evidence in the record to support this argument. The record indicates that in an interview with Pennsylvania State Trooper Cimbalista on March 14, 1983, Appellant was advised of his constitutional rights, including the right to the presence of an attorney. Appellant stated that he understood his rights and did not wish to speak to an attorney and proceeded to give an inculpatory statement.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5121 Escape:\n(a) Escape. \u2014 A person commits an offense if he unlawfully removes himself from official detention or fails to return to official detention following temporary leave granted for a specific purpose or limited period.\n(d) Grading.\u2014\n(1) An offense under this section is a felony of the third degree where:\n(i) the actor was arrested for or detained on a charge of felony or following conviction of crime:\n(ii) the actor employs force, threat, deadly weapon or other dangerous instrumentality to effect the escape; or\n(iii) a public servant concerned in detention of persons convicted of crime intentionally facilitates or permits an escape from a detention facility.\n(2) Otherwise an offense under this section is a misdemeanor of the second degree.\n(e) Definition. \u2014 As used in this section the phrase \"official detention\" means arrest, detention in any facility for custody of persons under charge or conviction of crime or alleged or found to be delinquent, detention for extradition or deportation, or any other detention for law enforcement purposes; but the phrase does not include supervision of probation or parole, or constraint incidental to release on bail. 1972, Dec. 6, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, effective June 6, 1973.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3502 Burglary:\n(a) Offense defined. \u2014 A person is guilty of burglary if he enters a building or occupied structure, or separately secured or occupied portion thereof, with intent to commit a crime therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the actor is licensed or privileged to enter.\n(b) Defense. \u2014 It is a defense of prosecution for burglary that the building or structure was abandoned.\n(c) Grading. \u2014 Burglary is a felony of the first degree.\n(d) Multiple convictions. \u2014 A person may not be convicted both for burglary and for the offense which it was his intent to commit after the burglarious entry or for an attempt to commit that offense, unless the additional offense constitutes a felony of the first or second degree. 1972, Dec. 6, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, effective June 6, 1973.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3501 Definitions\n\u201cOccupied structure.\" Any structure, vehicle or place adapted for overnight accommodation of persons, or for carrying on business therein, whether or not a person is actually present. 1972, Dec. 6, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, effective June 6, 1973.\n. We note that the jury also found that a second aggravating circumstance was present, namely, that \"appellant has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use of threat of violence to the person,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(9), based upon the fact that appellant concededly was convicted of murder once before, in 1972, for having shot to death a man in New Jersey. The presence of, and correctness of, a jury\u2019s finding of a second aggravating circumstance is not relevant in a case such as this where there have been found no mitigating circumstances, since an aggravating circumstance above requires a verdict of death.\u201d\n. Review of death sentence\u2014\n(1) A sentence of death shall be subject to automatic review by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania pursuant to its rules.\n(2) In addition to its authority to correct errors at trial, the Supreme Court shall either affirm the sentence of death or vacate the sentence of death and remand for the imposition of a life imprisonment sentence.\n(3) The Supreme Court shall affirm the sentence of death unless it determines that:\n(i) the sentence of death was the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor;\n(ii) the evidence fails to support the finding of an aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d); or\n(iii) the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the circumstances of the crime and the character and record of the defendant.\n. The Prothonotary of the Western District of Pennsylvania is directed to transmit to the Governor the full and complete record of the trial, sentencing hearing, imposition of sentence, and review by this Court. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 971 l(i)."}
