Boyle Company initiated an action in trespass and assumpsit in the civil division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas based upon the planning and administration of the Estate of Edward J. Boyle, Jr. After the decedent\u2019s death on September 20, 1975, his will was admitted to probate. The decedent, who was the sole shareholder of the Edward J. Boyle Company, bequeathed his stock in the company to his sons, Edward J. Boyle, III and Michael D. Boyle, and to David Deasy. The will provided further for a bequest of the decedent\u2019s estate which would qualify for the maximum marital deduction to Pittsburgh National Bank as the trustee of a revocable life insurance trust.\nThe debts of the decedent at the time of his death resulted in the insolvency of his estate. To satisfy the outstanding obligations, the decedent\u2019s daughters, the named beneficiaries of the residual trust created by the trust agreement, authorized the trustee to make an unsecured loan of $200,000.00 to the estate from the trust. The loan was made and was used to pay the estate debts. The stock was transferred unencumbered.\nExceptions to the executor\u2019s First and Final Account and to the trustee\u2019s First and Partial Account were filed by a trust beneficiary, however, contending that the unsecured loan depleted the interests of the beneficiaries. The ensuing litigation was resolved by the execution of a family settlement agreement. Subsequently, the Orphans\u2019 Court confirmed the executor\u2019s account and entered a decree of distribution.\nThe complaint sets forth allegations of negligent estate planning and administration, unfair trade practices, malpractice, fraud, and intentional infliction of emotional distress arising from the foregoing transactions. Preliminary objections were filed by the defendants raising, inter alia, a question of jurisdiction. The defendants asserted that \u00a7 711 of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code (\u201cPEF Code\u201d), Act of June 30, 1972, P.L. 508, No. 164, \u00a7 2, as amended, 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 711, required that the jurisdiction of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas over this matter be exercised through its orphans\u2019 court division. The administrative judge of the civil division entered an order transferring the action to the orphans\u2019 court division for disposition. Following the transfer, however, the plaintiffs\u2019 petition to retransfer the action to the civil division was granted by Judge Schwartz of the orphans\u2019 court division. The order was subsequently certified by Judge Schwartz for interlocutory appeal. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702(b); Pa.R.A.P. 1311. The Superior Court denied the defendants\u2019 petition for permission to appeal. We granted permission to appeal.\nSection 711 of the PEF Code enumerates the matters in which the jurisdiction of the court of common pleas shall be exercised through its orphans\u2019 court division. The administration and distribution of the real and personal property of decedents\u2019 estates and testamentary trusts are specifically enumerated in subsections (1) and (2) of \u00a7 711. The plaintiffs\u2019 action is only collaterally related to the administration and distribution of the decedent\u2019s estate and the revocable life insurance trust. As such, the action does not fall within the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s mandatory exercise of jurisdiction as set forth in that section. Section 712, relating to the non-mandatory exercise of jurisdiction through the orphans\u2019 court division, provides\n[t]he jurisdiction of the court of common pleas over the following may be exercised through either its orphans\u2019 court division or other appropriate division:\n* * * * Sic *\n(3) Other matters. \u2014 The disposition of any case where there are substantial questions concerning matters enumerated in section 711 (relating to mandatory exercise of jurisdiction through orphans\u2019 court division in general) and also matters not enumerated in that section.\nAlthough the defendants\u2019 preliminary objections purportedly raised a question of.jurisdiction, it is clear that the civil division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas had jurisdiction over the instant action under \u00a7 712(3). The action was properly brought in the civil division. It is also apparent from a review of the complaint that the civil division is the appropriate division for resolution of the issues raised therein. The issue of which division was proper to hear the action is not a question of jurisdiction or of venue. Defendants\u2019 preliminary objections raising the jurisdiction issue were improper.\nThe issue presented by this appeal is the propriety of the order of the orphans\u2019 court returning the action to the division in which it was originally commenced. In order to resolve the issue, we must first analyze whether the original transfer of the action to the orphans\u2019 court division was proper. Section 952 of the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 952, states,\n\u201cThe divisions of a court of common pleas are administrative units composed of those judges of the court responsible for the transaction of specified classes of the business of the court. In a court of common pleas having two or more divisions each division of the court is vested with the full jurisdiction of the whole court, but the business of the court may be allocated among the divisions of the court by or pursuant to general rules.\u201d\nAbsent a general rule which allocates these matters to a particular division of the court, an administrative judge of one division does not have the authority to refuse to exercise jurisdiction over a matter which is properly before the court. Nor may \u00a7 712 reasonably be interpreted to create such authority. The commentary to \u00a7 712 indicates that subsection (3) was \u201c... intended to avoid multiple actions in different divisions in a case involving two or more questions, one of which would ordinarily be decided by the orphans\u2019 court division and the other by the trial or family division.\u201d Inasmuch as the administrative judge of the civil division lacked the authority to refuse to entertain the action, the order transferring the action to the orphans\u2019 court division was a nullity. For this reason, Appellants\u2019 contention that the matter could not have been transferred back to the civil division by the orphans\u2019 court division must necessarily fail. The order of court retransferring the action to the civil division was valid.\nTo hold otherwise would effectively deprive the Appellees of their constitutional right to a jury trial. The transfer of this action from the civil to the orphans\u2019 court division is more than a mere change in form as the Appellants seem to suggest. Although a unified court system has been established, significant differences, which are not matters of administrative convenience, exist in the practice in the orphans\u2019 court that would affect this action. Rule 3.1 of the Supreme Court Orphans\u2019 Court Rules states,\n[ejxcept where otherwise provided by a rule adopted by the Supreme Court, or by an Act of Assembly or by general rule or special order of the local Orphans\u2019 Court ... the pleading and practice shall conform to the pleading and practice in equity in the local Court of Common Pleas.\nThe most striking difference between pursuing the action at law in the civil division and proceeding in the orphans\u2019 division is in the right to a jury trial. The submission of any or all issues of fact to a trial by jury rests in the discretion of the court if the action is commenced in the orphans\u2019 court division. Pa.R.C.P. 1513. Article I, section 6 of the Pennsylvania Constitution \u201c... has been construed as requiring the right to trial by jury in all matters in which the right to a jury trial has been recognized at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1790. (Citation omitted)\u201d. Parker v. Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, 483 Pa. 106, 394 A.2d 932 (1978). The right to a jury trial in this matter may not be circumvented by a transfer from one division of the court to another.\nThe order of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas entered on March 8, 1983 is hereby affirmed.\nFLAHERTY, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nPAPADAKOS, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. The Appellants contend that Judge Schwartz lacked the authority to retransfer the action, asserting that it was an improper review of an interlocutory order by another judge of the same court. Where, as here, the civil division judge lacked the authority to transfer the matter to another division, this argument, and the case law cited in support thereof, are inapplicable."}
