{"id": "1896844", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThis is a declaratory judgment proceeding seeking a determination: (1) of the validity and enforceability of a provision in a contract consummated in 1907, as amended, giving the City of Philadelphia the right to purchase \u201call the property and franchises\u201d of the Philadelphia Transportation Company; and, (2) the formula to be applied in determining the purchase price, as provided for in the contract.\nThis appeal, under the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, \u00a71, 12 P.S. \u00a7672, questions the jurisdiction of the court to resolve the issues involved in a declaratory judgment proceeding.\nOur examination of the record is convincing that the lower court properly overruled the jurisdictional objection, and that every issue, presently pertinent, is correctly and adequately answered in the excellent opinion of the court below.\nOrder affirmed."}
