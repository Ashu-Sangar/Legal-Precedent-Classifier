{"id": "1158972", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nFay Vogel, a guest in an automobile driven by her brother-in-law, Joel Taub, was injured by his negligence, November 24, 1929. She and her husband brought suit against Taub, October 14,1931, to recover for the injury sustained. After her death on June 27, 1932, her husband, who had been appointed administrator, was substituted as plaintiff as to her claim.\nIn bar of the action, Taub relied on two releases, one signed by Fay Vogel on December 12, 1929, and the other, by her and her husband, December 31,1929. Plaintiff replied that the releases were obtained by fraud, and that, as to the husband, there was no consideration for tlie joint release. The court submitted the evidence to the jury who found verdicts for the plaintiff. Later, defendant\u2019s motions for judgment n. o. v. were granted, on the ground that the evidence offered to set aside the releases was not sufficient for the purpose. These appeals followed.\nWe start with the fact that the releases were executed and delivered with the intention of discharging Taub from liability. The settled rule is that to set aside such a release on the ground that it was obtained by fraud, the evidence must be, as was said in Ralston v. P. R. T. Co., 267 Pa. 257, 265, 268, 275, 110 A. 329, \u201cclear, precise and indubitable.\u201d In Lindemann v. Pitts. Rys. Co., 251 Pa. 489, 492, 96 A. 1085^\u201cindubitable proof\u201d is defined as \u201cevidence that is not- only found to be credible, but of such weight and directness as to make out the facts alleged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d See also Leonard v. Coleman, 273 Pa. 62, 116 A. 550; Horsey v. Ciaroro, 280 Pa. 513, 124 A. 677; Keys v. Hanscom Bros., 288 Pa. 389, 135 A. 860. Application of that rule requires agreement with the conclusion reached by the learned court below.\nMrs. Vogel sustained injuries which, during the period when the release of the claims was under consideration, were not Considered serious. Defendant, Taub, carried insurance. The insurer was represented by an adjuster, named Baturin, who obtained the releases. He mailed to Mrs. Vogel a blank form designed to elicit an account of the accident and injury; she returned it to him with the blanks filled in her writing. Opposite the printed lyords \u201cNature and extent of injuries\u201d she had written \u201ccuts & bru\u201d [bruises?]. Opposite the \u201cName and Address of attending Doctor\u201d was \u201cDr. Harry Fowler.\u201d Opposite the words \u201cAmount for which you are making claim\u201d she had written \u201cOne Hundred Dollars.\u201d On December 12, 1929, after Baturin had received this written report, he called on her and discussed settlement. He took from her a written statement of the accident and her condition; it was signed by her and witnessed by him. In this she said \u201cWe were all bruised and cut from glass breaking and other minor injuries. I was under the care of Dr. Harry Fowler of this city for a short time, and although I still have some pain in my back I am able to get around a bit. Fortunately I had no serious injuries such as fractures, lacerations, etc.\u201d She then executed the release of that date, in consideration of a draft for $15, which was collected.\nAfter receiving this release (which apparently did not meet the requirements of the insurance company), a form of release in duplicate was mailed to the Vogels and, about ten days later (December 31, 1929), Baturin called on them. Baturin testified that he then informed Mr. Vogel that the paper he desired executed was \u201ca complete release of all claims of Mr. Vogel and Mrs. Vogel against Joel Taub.\u201d Both husband and Avife then executed this release in duplicate. It is in the same form as that executed December 12th, by Mrs. Vogel, except that it released the claims of both. So the matter stood until April 2,1930, when plaintiff\u2019s attorney wrote defendant\u2019s insurer making further claims for Mrs. Vogel\u2019s injuries.\nWe then have releases executed, as the letter states, when Mrs. Vogel \u201cwas apparently uninjured,\u201d which it is now proposed to set aside for fraud. What is the fraud suggested? Among the circumstances relied on to set aside the release of December 12th are the following : Baturin was a connection of the defendant by marriage. Plaintiff\u2019s daughter testified that, sometime between the date of the accident and the date of the first release, she heard the defendant, Taub, say to her mother \u201c \u2018Don\u2019t worry, Arthur will take care of you.\u2019 Q. Did you know who was the Arthur referred to? A. Arthur Baturin.\u201d While Baturin testifies that Mrs. Newman, Fay Vogel\u2019s mother, was present during the whole interview of December 12th, when the release was obtained, she testified that she was not there during the interview, but arrived when her daughter was about to execute the release; she testified that: \u201cHe said to her, \u2018Now, you certainly wouldn\u2019t go against yo\u00far brother-in-law.\u2019 She says, \u2018Not for the world,\u2019.......Q. What else did he say? A. He didn\u2019t say anything but he told her to sign and she signed. So he says, \u2018Being that you are a poor Jewish woman I will give you the sum of $15.\u2019 That is what I overheard, no more, he put on his hat and went out.\u201d Mrs. Newman then witnessed her daughter\u2019s signature to the release. While Baturin denies making these statements, we shall consider the case as though he had made them.\nBaturin testified, in cross-examination, \u201cIf you are talking about figures, it is my recollection, Mr. Siegel [attorney for plaintiff], that she thought she was entitled to about $75 or $85 for her injuries.\u201d He also testified that she said that Dr. Fowler was her physician and had made two visits and that his bill was $4. The result of the discussion was that she agreed to take $15 in settlement; he produced a form of release and filled it out and also filled out a draft, which he delivered after she executed the release. Baturin admitted that he \u201ctold Mrs. Vogel she was not entitled to any considerable sum of money on the basis of a mere $4 medical bill, and the fact that her injuries were very trivial. Q. You told her her injuries were trivial? A. According to the medical report of Dr. Fowler, exactly.\u201d This report we do not have; when defendant offered it in evidence, the plaintiff objected and the court sustained the objection.\nAs to the second release, Mr. Vogel testified that he told Baturin he \u201cput one over on my wife,\u201d and that he \u201cwould sign on one condition, that if anything happens that he will take care of the wife\u201d; that Baturin said, \u201c \u2018All right, I will\u2019 \u201d; \u201cthat the wife had signed, he had to have my signature as husband, that it wouldn\u2019t make any difference whether I signed or not, but he had to have both signatures.\u201d Baturin would not at first deny having made such a statement. On cross-examination, Vogel testified \u201che didn\u2019t say that [that it didn\u2019t matter whether he signed or not], he told me that it was a matter of having my signature with the Mrs., that it didn\u2019t matter just so we have both signatures on together\u201d; that he (Vogel) didn\u2019t say (on direct examination) that Baturin said it didn\u2019t matter whether his signature was there or not; that Baturin wanted his signature \u201cbecause he had my Mrs. signature, he had to have both signatures. Q. He told you that, you understood that? A. Yes, I understood that. Q. You and your wife had it [the form of release] in your possession about ten days? A. About ten days....... Q. Did you know the contents? A. Oh, I didn\u2019t read it, but I guess I knew what it was. Q. You knew that you and your wife were by that paper releasing Mr. Taub from the payment of any damages on account of an accident occurring on the highway between Centre Hall and Potters Mills, Pa., wherein Fay Vogel sustained both internal and external injuries? A. I knew she had signed, yes. Q. You knew when you were signing you were releasing Mr. Taub from the payment of any money, did you? A. At the time I signed, yes.\u201d Baturin testified \u201cThat the company in Philadelphia branch office asked that a corrected release be signed by both the husband as well as the wife, and those release forms in duplicate were already in the hands of Mr. and Mrs. Vogel, had been mailed out ten days before.\u201d\nThe alleged statement by Taub that \u201cArthur will take care of you\u201d and Baturin\u2019s promise to Mr. Vogel to take care of Mrs. Vogel, are too indefinite to have any value as an enforceable agreement: Ogden v. Traction Co., 202 Pa. 480, 487, 52 A. 9; and do not constitute fraud: Humphrey v. Brown, 291 Pa. 53, 58, 139 A. 606. There is no evidence to show that Baturin had any knowledge, or even suspicion, that Mrs. Vogel\u2019s injuries were not trivial, when he took the releases; by that time she herself had seen a doctor only once or twice, and in her written report to the insurance company, had made claim for only $100. In those. circumstances, we can see no support for the allegation of fraud in the statements that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t go against her brother-in-law\u201d; that Baturin was paying her $15 because she was poor, or in all of the statements, alleged to have been made, taken together. In December, 1929, Baturin was settling the claims, not only in the light of his own knowledge, but on the statement and belief of Mrs. Vogel that her injuries were not serious. The letter of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, quoted above, states that'when the releases were executed \u201cMrs. Vogel was apparently uninjured.\u201d If the fatal character of her condition, as it developed subsequently, was unknown to her at the time, and to her and her husband on the 31st of December, 1929, Baturin cannot be blamed for not knowing it then. The evidence is not sufficient, within the rule, to support a finding that the releases were obtained by fraud.\nIn the appeal of the husband, an additional point is made to the effect that there was no consideration for the release in which he joined on December 31st.' The contention is without merit, and is controlled by Beal Estate Co. of Pitts, v. Budolph, 301 Pa. 502, 153 A. 438. The release recites and contains an acknowledgment of the fact that $15 was paid for the claims of both of them and for the purpose for which they received it and to carry out the intention of all the parties.\nIn each appeal the judgment is affirmed.\n\u201cI have been consulted by Mr. Daniel Vogel relative to the injuries which his wife sustained while a guest in the automobile of Joel Taub when his car upset. Mr. Vogel informs me that both he and his wife signed a release for the sum of $15 shortly after the accident, when Mrs. Vogel was apparently uninjured.\n\u201cAs you, I believe, already know, it has since developed that Mrs. Vogel sustained an injury in that accident by reason of which she was compelled to undergo two operations and was confined to the hospital and by reason of which she may be compelled to undergo further considerable treatment.\n\u201cIf you have not already done so, will you please take this matter up with your company, and advise me what their intentions in this matter are.\u201d"}
