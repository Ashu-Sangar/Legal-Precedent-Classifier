{"id": "1207030", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Schaffer,\nPlaintiff appeals from the refusal of the court below to take off a compulsory nonsuit entered in this action, which she brought to recover damages .for injuries she sustained by falling on a street of defendant city.\nShe was walking North on the West side of Second Street on December 12, 1936, about 5.30 o\u2019clock p. m. In so doing she' had to cross Pine Street, which intersects and runs at right angles to Second Street. The bed of Pine Street was constructed of wooden blocks. There was a 30 inch wide strip or band of macadam 3y2 inches high over the blocks which extended parallel to the'curb of the highway. It was over this strip of macadam that plaintiff tripped and fell. She testified that as she proceeded to cross the street she was looking for traffic, \u201cI was not looking at the cartway. I was not looking down at all. I was watching for traffic.\u201d In answer to the question whether she saw what she stumbled or tripped over before she fell, she said she did not, as she was not looking down. Th\u00e9re was nothing to obstruct her view as she crossed the street and had she looked she would have seen the macadam strip. In the circumstances as plaintiff herself detailed them, under all Our cases, she was guilty of contributory negligence, which bars recovery. As we said in Reed v. Phila., 311 Pa. 283, 285, 166 A. 891: \u201cWe are impressed from a reading of the record that the plaintiff was more intent upon watching traffic than upon watching her steps. She was bound in order to pru: dently safeguard herself to survey all the ground where she was intending to step; otherwise, she would step without knowing what she was walking into.\u201d Other cases pertinent to the ruling we make are Robb v. Connellsville Borough, 137 Pa. 42, 20 A. 564; Lerner v. Phila., 221 Pa. 294, 70 A. 755 Mulford v. P. R. T. Co., 310 Pa. 521, 165 A. 837.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
