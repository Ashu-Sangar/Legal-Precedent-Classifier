{"id": "1945673", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nAppellant, Mrs. Edna E. Crammer, challenges the action of the Secretary of the Department of Public Welfare in excluding her from the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d program of medical assistance under Title XIX of the Social Security Act. We conclude that appellant has erroneously been denied benefits. We reverse.\nI\nMrs. Crammer is sixty-two years of age and has been determined to be, by the Social Security Administration, totally and permanently disabled. Prior to March of 1970, appellant was receiving a $95.00 per month Department o,f Public Welfare (hereinafter the Department) public assistance payment. *****In addition to this $95.00 per month cash payment, Mrs. Crammer was classed as \u201ccategorically needy\u201d under the Pennsylvania Medicaid program, thus entitling her to receive, among other medical services, free prescribed medications. As determined by the Department, appellant has necessary and recurring drug expenses of approximately $60.00 per month.\nIn March of 1970, appellant\u2019s cash assistance benefits (derived exclusively from Old Age Survivors Disability Insurance) were increased to the present $115.00 per month. Under Department regulations appellant was required to accept this additional $20.00 per month. Because of this increase appellant was removed from the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d Medicaid program. The Department thereafter transferred appellant to the \u201cmedically needy\u201d program, which, under applicable Pennsylvania statutes, does not, and did not, afford appellant free prescription medicines. As a result of the Department\u2019s determination, Mrs. Crammer\u2019s medicinal needs must now be met by expending $60.00 per month from her Social Security allotment. The end economic result of this reclassification is that appellant how is left with only $55.00 per month to meet her \u201ccommon needs\u201d of food, shelter, clothing and incidentals. Before her Social Security increase, appellant was allowed $40.00 more per month to meet these identical \u201ccommon needs\u201d.\nAfter exhausting all administrative remedies, appellant appealed to the Commonwealth Court which, after an initial argument before a three-judge panel, ordered reargument before the court en banc. On November 19, 1971, the Commonwealth Court affirmed, by an equally divided court, the Department\u2019s action denying appellant \u201ccategorically needy\u201d benefits. We granted allocatur.\nII\nOur determination of appellant\u2019s claim is primarily controlled by Title XIX of the Federal Social Security Act and the Pennsylvania Statutes which implement it.\nTitle XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 TT.S.C. \u00a71396 ff, creates a comprehensive scheme for providing medical assistance to the needy. Under this program, if the state elects to participate, the costs are shared by the federal government. The state further has the option of deciding to what extent it will participate and the extent of coverage to be offered. The Commonwealth has decided to provide coverage for both the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d and the \u201cmedically needy\u201d.\nUnder the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d program, full medical benefits are afforded those actually receiving or eligible to receive cash assistance grants under one of the Commonwealth\u2019s federally funded public assistance programs for the blind, aged, disabled or families with dependent children. Pennsylvania\u2019s program in this respect fully comports with the federal requirements set out in 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a(a) (10) (A).\nAdditionally, the Commonwealth has chosen to participate in the optional program of providing medical assistance, although of a more limited nature, to those classed as \u201cmedically needy\u201d. 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a(a) (10) (B). This classification encompasses those people who are blind, aged, disabled or families with dependent children, but whose income, although allegedly sufficient to cover daily living expenses (more than that allowable under public assistance guidelines), is insufficient to pay for required medical care. Thus, this class embraces the same category of recipients as does section 1396a(a) (10) (A), with the difference being that the \u201cmedically needy\u201d have additional available income.\nSection 1396a(a) (17) of Title 42 imposes additional requirements upon the state plans implementing the Medicaid program; paramount among these requirements is that all state plans adopt \u201creasonable standards\u201d for determining Medicaid eligibility. Under subsection (17), \u201creasonable standards\u201d include: (1) standards which consider only actually available income,, 42 U.S.O. \u00a71396a(a) (17) (B); (2) standards \u25a0which, provide for the reasonable evaluation of resources, 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a(a) (17) (C) and; (3) standards which are flexible insofar as they take into account, \u201cexcept to the extent prescribed by the Secretary, the costs (whether in the form of insurance premiums or otherwise) incurred for medical care or for any oilier type of remedial care recognised under State law .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a(a) (17) (D) (emphasis added).\nIn view of the requirements of subsection (17), we conclude that appellant is eligible for inclusion in the Medicaid \u201ccategorically needy\u201d program because her medical expenses are so large that her available income, as computed in accordance with the flexible income (spend-down) provision of subsection (17) (D), places her within the ambit of the Pennsylvania statute which implements the federal directives of 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a(a) (10) (A).\n\u201cThe following persons shall be eligible for medical assistance: (1) Persons who receive or are eligible to receive cash assistance grants under this article.\u201d Act of June 13, 1967, P. L. 31, art. IY, \u00a7441.1, as amended, 62P.S. \u00a7441.1 (Supp. 1972) (emphasis added).\nFor Medicaid pwposes only, not only are those people who actually receive welfare cash payments entitled to benefits as \u201ccategorically needy\u201d, but also those who, under the spend-down provision of subsection (17) (D), establish, eligibility for cash payments, thereby meeting the income requirements of the Pennsylvania \u201ccategorically needy\u201d program.\nHence appellant must be afforded \u201ccategorically needy\u201d benefits since her available income, when computed in accordance with the spend-down provision of subsection (17) (H), places her below the amount determined by the Department to be her minimum standard of need. Appellant\u2019s $115.00 per month, derived exclusively from Social Security, less $60.00 per month for drug expenses, leaves appellant only $55.00 per month to meet her minimum maintenance needs, which the Department concedes to be $95.00 per month.\nIll\nThe federal legislative history of the Medicaid Act clearly supports the conclusion that appellant is entitled to receive \u201ccategorically needy\u201d benefits. Tbe Finance Committee, in its report on the bill to tbe Senate, stated:\n\u201cTbe committee bill would make more specific a provision now in tbe law that in determining eligibility for and tbe extent of aid under tbe plan, States must use reasonable standards consistent with tbe objectives of tbe titles.\n\u201cTbe bill also contains a provision designed to correct one of tbe weaknesses identified in tbe medical assistance for tbe aged program. Under tbe current provisions of Federal law, some States have enacted programs wbicb contain a cut-off point on income wbicb determines tbe financial eligibility of tbe individual. Thus, an individual with an income just under tbe specified limit may qualify for all of tbe aid provided under tbe State plan. Individuals, however, whose income exceeds tbe limitation adopted by tbe State are found ineligible for tbe medical assistance provided under the State plan even though tbe excess of tbe individual\u2019s income may be small when compared with tbe cost of tbe medical care needed. In order that all States shall be flexible in tbe consideration of an individual\u2019s income, tbe committee bill requires that tbe State\u2019s standards for determining eligibility for and extent of medical assistance shall take into account, except to tbe extent prescribed by tbe Secretary, tbe cost\u2014whether in tbe form of insurance premiums or otherwise\u2014incurred for medical care or any other type of remedial care recognized under State law. Thus, before cm individual is found ineligible for all or part of the cost of his medical needs, the State must be sure that the income of the individual has been measured in terms of both the State\u2019s allowance for basic maintenance needs and the cost of the medical care he requires.\n\u201cThe State may require the use of all the excess income of the individual toward his medical expenses, or some proportion of that amount. In no event, however, with respect to either this provision or that described below toith reference to the use of deductibles for certain items of medical service, may a State require the use of income or resources which would bring the individual\u2019s income below the amount established as the test of eligibility under the State plan. Such action would reduce the individual below the level determined by the State as necessary for his maintenance.\u201d U. S. Code Cong, and Adm. News, 89 Cong., 1st Sess., 1965, pp. 2018-19 (emphasis added).\nSenator Ribicoff, whose comments appear in the Congressional Record, most succinctly articulated the Congressional intent when he stated:\n\u201cFinally, the bill would require States to apply means tests on a flexible basis, so as to take into account not only the individual\u2019s income, but also the cost and extent of the medical care he requires.\n\u201cI think there is no question that these changes which H.R. 6675 will make in the way that means tests are applied by the States are sound. They strike a sensible balance.\n\u201cIt is reasonable to allow States to make determinations of need and eligibility for public assistance programs; but it is unreasonable to allow the standards of eligibility to be applied m such a way that they prevent assistance from reaching those who may need it most.\u201d Cong. Rec., 89th Cong., 1st Sess., July 7, 1965, p. 15804 (emphasis added).\nA more lucid pronouncement of legislative intent can hardly be conceived. Yet the Secretary of the Department of Public Welfare, in denying appellant \u201ccategorically needy\u201d benefits, has done that which is explicitly forbidden by the federal statute; the Secretary has required appellant to utilize so much of her Social Security income for medical purposes, that her actual available income has been reduced \u201cbelow the level determined by the State as necessary for [her] maintenance.\u201d\nIV\nThe Department relies almost exclusively on the case of Fullington v. Shea 320 F. Supp. 500 (D. Colo. 1970), aff\u2019d, 404 U.S. 963, 92 S. Ct. 345 (1971) (per curiam), to support the proposition that the flexible income provision of 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a(a) (17) (D) does not apply in determining eligibility under the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d program set out in 42 U.S.C. \u00a71396a (a) (10) (A). It argues that Fullington precludes any interpretation of subsection (17) other than that the flexible income provision can only be applicable to those who fall within the ambit of the \u201cmedically needy\u201d program of 42 TJ.S.C. \u00a71396a(a) (10) (B). We find such an assertion to be untenable.\nA careful reading of Fullington reveals that only two issues were raised and decided, neither of which is applicable to, or even suggested by, the instant appeal: \u201cThere are two fundamental questions presented for consideration: (1) Whether Colorado has failed to follow out the federal statutory scheme\u2014this reduces to whether the federal laws relative to the \u2018medically indigent\u2019 are mandatory or optional; (2) whether the failure of Colorado to extend Medicaid to the \u2018medically indigent\u2019 while at the same time extending it to the \u2018categorical\u2019 recipients constitutes an invalid discrimination violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\u201d Fullington, supra at 503 (emphasis added).\nIn addition to denying the appellant\u2019s constitutional claim, the court in Fullington also disposed of the statutory question by holding: \u201cWe cannot, of course, ignore the clear thrust of Section (10). Hence, based on the analysis and the evidence [of Congressional and Department intent] we we constrained to hold that Congress has not required Colorado or any other state to include the medically indigent in a Medicaid program, and that the state\u2019s adoption or failure to adopt such a program toas optional.\u201d Id. at 505 (emphasis added).\nObviously, since Pennsylvania, unlike Colorado, has decided to exercise its option to participate in both the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d and \u201cmedically needy\u201d programs, the holding in Fullington is irrelevant, as well as inapplicable, to the instant case.\nFurther, as the Fullington court noted: \u201cColorado has elected to cover only those who receive aid under one of its public assistance programs. Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7119-12-3(10) and 119-12-4.\u201d Id. at 503 (emphasis added). Thus, the Colorado \u201ccategorically needy\u201d statute extends coverage to only those who actually receive public assistance payments under that state\u2019s programs. As already pointed out, our statute (62 P.S. \u00a7441.1 (1) (Supp. 1972)) is more comprehensive, providing \u201ccategorically needy\u201d services to not only those actually receiving cash payments, but also to those eligible to receive such funds. Therefore, FulUngton, based on a more restrictive Colorado statute, is inapposite, since under the Pennsylvania statute, appellant, Mrs. Crammer, is \u201celigible to receive cash assistance grants\u201d, for Medicaid purposes, thus entitling her to \u201ccategorically needy\u201d Medicaid benefits.\ny\nIt must be concluded that the determination of the Secretary of the Department of Public Welfare denying appellant benefits under the Pennsylvania \u201ccategorically needy\u201d Medicaid program is contrary to the controlling federal and Pennsylvania statutes. Accordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed, and the Secretary of the Department of Public Welfare is directed to afford appellant appropriate relief consistent with this opinion.\nIn view of our disposition, we need not pass upon appellant\u2019s two additional contentions: (1) Whether the refusal of the Department of Public Welfare to include appellant in the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d program violates the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment and; (2) Whether the Department of Public Welfare wrongfully denied appellant\u2019s eligibility to receive \u201cnon-money\u201d payment medical assistance to meet her drug needs.\nThis amount was determined to be, by the Department of Public Welfare, Mrs. Crammer\u2019s \u201cminimum maintenance amount\u201d, i.e., the amount necessary to meet her \u201ccommon needs\u201d of food, shelter, clothing and incidentals. See Department of Public Welfare\u2014Office of Family Services\u2014Public Assistance Manual \u00a73210.\nAct of June 13, 1967, P. L. 31, art. IV, \u00a7\u00a7441.1 et seq., as amended, 62 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7441.1 et seq. (Supp. 1972).\nSee Department of Public Welfare\u2014Office of Family Services\u2014Public Assistance Manual \u00a7\u00a73230 and 3232.\nAfter departmental deductions, the total amount determined to be received by appellant under the increased Social Security payment was $111.00 per month. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s increase, as computed by the Department of Public Welfare, was only $16.00 per month.\nSince appellant\u2019s standard of need has been determined by the Department of Public Welfare to be $95.00 per month, receipt of any income exceeding that amount now results, under existing departmental policy, in discontinuance of \u201ccategorically needy\u201d Medicaid benefits. Under the Pennsylvania Medicaid plan, a person is \u201ccategorically needy\u201d and eligible for complete medical benefits if he receives or is eligible to receive cash assistance grants under Article IV of Title 62 (Public Assistance). Act of June 13, 1967, P. L. 31, art. IV, \u00a7441.1, as amended, 62 P.S. \u00a7441.1 (Supp. 1972).\n\u201cA person shall be considered medically needy if he: (1) Besides in Pennsylvania, regardless of the duration of his residence or his absence therefrom; and\n\u201c(2) Meets the standards of financial eligibility established by the department with the approval of the Governor. In establishing these standards the department shall take into account (i) the funds certified by the Budget Secretary as available for medical assistance for the medically needy; (ii) pertinent Federal legislation and regulations; and (iii) the cost of living.\u201d Act of June 13, 1967, P.

IV, \u00a7443.4, as amended, 62 P.S. \u00a7443.4 (Supp. 1972) (emphasis added).\nA hearing was held, at the request of appellant, before a state welfare hearing examiner on April 28, 1970, wherein the discontinuance by the Department was affirmed. A rehearing was held on June 15, 1970, the result being that appellant\u2019s \u201ccategorically needy\u201d benefits were reinstated. On December 17, 1970, the Secretary of the Department of Public Welfare notified appellant that her \u201ccategorically needy\u201d classification was again being revoked.\nCrammer v.

Commonwealth Ct. 460, 467 (1971).\nSenator McNamara, the sponsor of the Senate bill, speaking on the floor of the Senate, brought the intent of subsection (17) into even sharper focus: \u201cWe had criticized the in-or-out income tests employed by some States in determining eligibility. For example\u2014if a State had a test of $1,500 in income, a person with $1,501 would be ineligible despite the fact that he might have had thousands of dollars of expenses\u2014while an individual with $1,499 in income and only $100 or $200 in expenses would be eligible. The new legislation corrects this situation by requiring the States to relate their income tests to the expenses incurred by the applicant. Cong. Bee., 89th Cong., 1st Sess., July 8, 1965, p. 15876.\nThe analysis of subsection (17) found in the Senate Finance Committee report was also introduced into the Congressional Beeord, by Senator Long: \u201cEligibility: improvements would be effectuated in the program for the needy elderly by requiring that the States must provide a flexible income test which takes into account medical expenses and does not provide rigid income standards which arbitrarily deny assistance to people with large medical bills.\u201d Cong. Bee., 89th Cong., 1st Sess., July 6, 1965, p. 15604.\nThe three judges of the Commonwealth Court who were of the opinion that the decision of the Secretary of the Department of Public Welfare to deny appellant \u201ccategorically needy\u201d benefits should be affirmed also relied heavily on Fullmgton.\nFullington was decided by a three-judge district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72281 and 22S4.\nSee note 11, supra.\nSee note 19, supra.\nBWe are mindful of the recently (October 30, 1972) enacted amendments, contained in H.R. 1, to the Federal Social Security Act. However, our disposition in the instant case is in no way effected by these changes.
