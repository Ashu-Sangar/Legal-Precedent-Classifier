{"id": "898003", "contents": "Per, Curiam,\nIt was clearly established by the testimony of the plaintiffs that the accident was occasioned by the boy suddenly running against the car, or upon the track immediately in front of the car. He was sixteen years of age, and responsible for his acts. There was no opportunity for the motorman to prevent the collision, and in such circumstances, as we have many times held, there can be no recovery.\nJudgment affirmed."}
