{"id": "356249", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nCASTILLE, Justice.\nThe sole issue before this Court in this criminal matter is whether the guilty verdicts rendered by the jury were the result of improper judicial coercion stemming from the trial court\u2019s supplemental instruction to the jury. Since we find that this issue was not properly preserved for appeal due to appellee\u2019s failure to lodge a timely objection to the trial court\u2019s instruction, we reverse the order of the Superior Court.\nThe relevant facts are as follows: On April 8, 1993, at approximately 3:30 a.m., Erie County Police Officer Tom Eberlein was on patrol when he observed a red Pontiac proceed across an intersection against a red light while traveling at a high rate of speed. Officer Eberlein pursued the vehicle for three city blocks. The Pontiac accelerated to a speed of approximately sixty or seventy miles an hour and ran two more red lights before the driver lost control of the vehicle which jumped the curb and came to a stop. Four people, including appellee, jumped out of the car and fled. Appellee was closest to Officer Eberlein, who pursued him first in his police vehicle, and then on foot. As he fled, appellee reached into his pocket and dropped a vial containing 3.7 grams of crack cocaine.\nWith the help of other officers, Officer Eberlein tackled appellee and subdued him. A search of appellee revealed that he had $743.00 in cash on his person. Appellee was charged with possession of a controlled substance, possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, aggravated assault of a police officer, and resisting arrest. Appellee\u2019s jury trial lasted only four hours. In its charge to the jury, the trial court stated, inter alia, the following:\nYour verdict must be unanimous. That means in order to return to this courtroom with a verdict, each of you must agree to [the] verdict. You have a duty to consult with each other with a view towards reaching an agreement, but only if you can do so without doing any violence to your own individual judgment. Each of you must decide this case for him or herself. But only after there has been fair and impartial deliberation with your fellow jurors. In the course of deliberation each juror should not hesitate to reexamine his or her view or change his or her mind if convinced it is erroneous. However, no juror should surrender the weight or effect of their conviction merely because it may differ from their fellow jurors or they might be in the minority or for the mere purpose of returning a unanimous verdict.\nN.T. at 177-78.\nThe jury recessed to begin their deliberations at 4:45 p.m. At 6:00 p.m., the jury returned to the courtroom and posed the following question to the court: \u201c[I]f the injury is more accidental than intentional, is it still aggravated assault?\u201d In response, the trial court repeated the legal definition of aggravated assault of a police officer. The jury resumed deliberations at 6:03 p.m. At 6:20 p.m., the jury returned to the courtroom and asked the trial court what would happen to the other charges if they could not reach a verdict on the aggravated assault charge. The trial court responded:\nIf you cannot reach a verdict, you mean you would be a hung jury. I am the one who declares whether you\u2019re a hung jury or not. This case is about as straightforward as you can get. I am not going to hang this jury. So you\u2019ll deliberate until I feel that you can\u2019t deliberate anymore.\nNow, please do what I\u2019ve instructed you to do. Find the facts from the evidence and apply them to the law, just the facts. Not theory, ifs ands or buts. This has been a short trial, the evidence is quite clear, you have one or two people to believe basically. I\u2019m not going to hang you on that charge. Let\u2019s go back, do your job as responsible jurors.\nN.T. at 182. Appellee did not object to the court\u2019s supplemental instruction.\nThe jury returned to the jury room at 6:22 p.m., and at 7:25 p.m., announced a verdict of guilty of all charges. In post-sentence motions, appellee claimed for the first time that the supplemental instruction coerced the jury into reaching a verdict by implying that the jury would not be dismissed until it reached a unanimous verdict. The trial court denied relief, determining that the supplemental instruction was not coercive because the jury had deliberated for a mere one hour and thirty-five minutes before indicating its difficulty in reaching a verdict on the assault charge. The Superior Court reversed and remanded the case for a new trial, finding that the supplemental instruction was coercive, thereby denying appellee his right to a fair trial. Commonwealth v. Edmondson, 447 Pa.Super. 596, 602, 670 A.2d 183, 186 (1996). The Superior Court based its reversal on its determination that the trial court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s second question was indeed coercive. However, due to appellee\u2019s failure to object to that instruction when the court issued it, this issue was not properly preserved for appeal. Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1119 provides in pertinent part:\n(b) No portions of the charge nor omissions therefrom may be assigned as error, unless specific objections are made thereto before the jury retires to deliberate. All such objections shall be made beyond the hearing of the jury-\n(c) After the jury has retired to consider its verdict, additional or correctional instructions may be given by the trial judge in the presence of all parties, except that the defendant\u2019s absence without cause shall not preclude proceeding, as provided in Rule 1117.\n(emphasis added). In Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974), this Court held that allegations of error in the trial court\u2019s instructions would not be considered on appeal absent an objection at trial, even if the errors were basic and fundamental. This Court reasoned that:\nThe defense may not successfully complain of trial errors for the first time only after the jury has returned a verdict of guilty, unless the errors were initially challenged at trial, and thereby preserved on appeal.... [To hold otherwise] encourages defense counsel to sit by silently without calling errors to the trial court\u2019s attention until after the guilty verdict is returned.\nId. at 420, 326 A.2d at 273. Requiring a timely, specific objection to be lodged in the trial court ensures that the trial judge has a chance to correct alleged trial errors and eliminates the possibility that the appellate court will be required to expend time and energy reviewing points on which no trial ruling has been made. See Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114 (1974).\nHere, even though the jury instruction in question may have been coercive, as determined by the Superior Court, appellee failed to object to the trial court\u2019s supplemental instruction when it was given. This failure deprived the court of the opportunity to give a curative instruction if it felt that one was appropriate. Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1119 clearly requires that a timely objection be lodged in order to preserve error in the original instructions. The fact that appellee raised this issue in post-trial motions and in his statement of matters complained of on appeal and the trial court addressed the issue does not change the result. The appellant in Dilliplaine raised the issue of error in the trial court\u2019s instructions in post-trial motions, and this Court found that the issue was nonetheless waived due to appellant\u2019s failure to object.\nWe reaffirm the policy interests of judicial economy identified in Clair. The Superior Court erred by reversing the judgment of sentence based on an issue that has not been properly preserved on appeal. Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the Superior Court for the disposition of appellee\u2019s remaining claims.\nNIGRO, J., files a concurring opinion.\nCAPPY, J., concurs in the result.\n. 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(16).\n. 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30).\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702(a)(3). Appellee struck Officer Eberlein in the nose during the struggle.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5104.\n. This instruction regarding the jury's obligation to reach an agreement is in complete harmony with the American Bar Association\u2019s approved instruction which this Court specifically recommended in Commonwealth v. Spencer, 442 Pa. 328, 337-38, 275 A.2d 299, 304-05 (1971).\n. In so doing, the Superior Court found it unnecessary to address other issues raised on appeal.\n. This Court may raise the issue of waiver sua sponte. Commonwealth v. Triplett, 476 Pa. 83, 89, 381 A.2d 877, 881 (1977) (holding that although the issue of waiver as to the appellant\u2019s allegation of trial court error had not been addressed by either party, this Court could raise the issue of waiver sua sponte).\n. There are comparable rules requiring specific objections to trial court's instructions in both civil and criminal cases. See Pa.R.C.P. No. 227(b).\n. In doing so, we make no statement on the merits of appellee's waived claim."}
