{"id": "1118265", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nPlaintiff sued to recover for personal injuries alleged to have been due to the negligence of defendant; the case was submitted to the jury, which rendered a verdict for defendant, on which judgment was entered; plaintiff has appealed.\nThe sole complaints here are that the trial judge, in the course of his charge, \u201cso misstated testimony as to be unduly favorable to defendant and mislead the jury\u201d; and that the charge, \u201cby undue enlargement and repetition on the subject of contributory negligence,\u201d prejudiced plaintiff in the eyes of the jury.\nThe presiding judge, at the end of his charge, asked counsel on both sides if there was anything else they desired him to say to the jury, and neither made answer. There were no requests for special instructions, and the only exception taken to the charge was a general one granted to counsel for both plaintiff and defendant. We find no reversible error.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
