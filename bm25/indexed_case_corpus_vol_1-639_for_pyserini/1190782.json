{"id": "1190782", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe sole issue to be determined in this case of replevin for a clam-shell crane was one of title and right of possession. All extraneous matters may be treated as surplusage : Blossom Prod. Corp. v. Natl. Underwear Co., 325 Pa. 383, 387. Appellee claimed title under the terms of a bailment lease, and the right to possession because of appellant\u2019s default. The latter did not simply deny this allegation generally, (for that would be insufficient, Jones et al. v. Dubuque F. & M. Ins. Co., 317 Pa. 144, 147), but specifically asserted title by virtue of a separate agreement of sale at a later date, describing the terms thereof. Although it was not stated whether the agreement of sale was written or oral, and the name of the agent who acted for appellee was not given, these omissions were not sufficient to warrant a summary judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense; under the circumstances, these were defects of form.\nA court should never award a summary judgment in any case unless it is free from doubt, and one in which a jury trial would be useless. As stated in Helfenstein v. Line Mount. Coal Co., 284 Pa. 78, 81, \u201cjudgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense should not be ordered except in clear cases.\u201d\nJudgment reversed with a venire.\nSee Lee-Strauss Co. v.
