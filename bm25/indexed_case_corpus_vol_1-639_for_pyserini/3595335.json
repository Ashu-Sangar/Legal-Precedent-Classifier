{"id": "3595335", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 21st day of November, 2007, the order of the Commonwealth Court is VACATED, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings. The order under review initially observes that the Department may rely on a court order reflecting lines, costs, and restitution in implementing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9728, but then merely recites that the Department relied on a \u201ccommunication\u201d from the trial court (or more properly, the clerk of courts) indicating outstanding obligations. Such commentary was insufficient to support the award of summary relief.\nWe offer no opinion concerning the disposition of the petition for review on any other or related ground.\nJurisdiction is relinquished."}
