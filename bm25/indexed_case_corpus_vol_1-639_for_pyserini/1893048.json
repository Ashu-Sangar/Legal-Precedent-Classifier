{"id": "1893048", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nWhere a testator in a eoneededly valid will gives to a named executor his residuary estate for \u201cdistribution to and amongst such local charities as he [the executor] shall determine in his sole discretion\u201d, does the executor in his representative capacity, under the Register of Wills Act of 1951, have the right to appeal from the probate of a codicil to such will which codicil completely cancels the gift of the residuary estate made in the will? Such constitutes the primary issue on this appeal.\nOn September 19, 1959, Robert M. Thompson (testator) made a will wherein he appointed L. S. Mosher as sole executor. In the 19 th paragraph of that will, testator gave the \u201cexecutor\u201d certain personal effects, \u201cin trust nevertheless, to distribute the same among such persons and in the manner as indicated by a memorandum to be enclosed in the envelope with this will but not to be recorded as a part of it\u201d. Under the 20th paragraph, testator gave the \u201cexecutor\u201d all the residuary estate \u201cfor the purpose and administration and distribution to and amongst such local charities as he shall determine in his sole discretion in such amounts and such proportions as he shall choose, and I specifically provide that his conduct in such division of my residuary estate shall not be questioned.\u201d\nSubsequent to testator\u2019s death on March 21, 1963, Bronte Greenwood, a member of' the Philadelphia bar, petitioned the Register of Wills of Erie County to probate the 1959 will and a codicil thereto, both instruments were probated and letters testamentary were issued to Greenwood, the codicil-named executor.\nThe codicil \u2014 the validity of which is attacked \u2014 purports to have been executed on April 26, 1962. Insofar as presently pertinent, this codicil cancels the 19th and 20th paragraphs of the 1959 will and, in substitution thereof, testator in the codicil purports to give the residue of his estate \u201cunto [his] loyal and faithful friend, Myra Parkhurst, to be owned outright and-.in fee by her\u201d, and he also gave her \u201cthe power to designate distribution therefrom to and amongst any charitable organizations she may desire and in any amounts, she may desire\u201d and he specifically provided \u201cthat .her conduct in such - designation shall not be questioned, nor shall she be required to make any such designation\u2019\u2019.\nOn July 23, 1963, Mosher, \u201cnot as executor but as beneficiary under the nineteenth paragraph and as the party having the duty and authority to distribute the bulk of [testator\u2019s] estate among Erie charities under the twentieth paragraph of the will\u201d, appealed from the probate of the codicil to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Erie County. The basis of his appeal was two-fold: (a) that testator, \u2014 86 years old at the time \u2014 , was not of sound mind when the codicil was executed and (b) that the codicil was procured by undue influence exerted upon decedent by Myra Parkhurst and \u201cperhaps by others named in said writing\u201d.\nPreliminary objections filed by Myra Parkhurst averred: (a) that Mosher lacked standing to appeal from the probate of the codicil and (b) that the appeal petition failed to set forth specifically the facts relied upon to sustain the several charges. Notice was given by Mosher to the Attorney General as parens patriae and St. Barnabas House and Erie City School District were permitted by the court to join as petitioner-appellants.\nThe court below sustained the preliminary objections as to Mosher on both grounds and dismissed Mosher\u2019s appeal. From that decree Mosher has taken this appeal.\nUnder onr case law and the Register of Wills Act, Act of June 28, 1951, P. L. 638, \u00a7208, 20 P.S. \u00a71840.208, an executor, as such, lacks standing to prosecute an appeal from the decree of a Register of Wills: Faust Estate, 364 Pa. 529, 531, 73 A. 2d 369; Sand\u2019s Estate, 288 Pa. 569, 136 A. 864; Reese\u2019s Estate, 317 Pa. 473, 177 A. 792. As a prerequisite to such appeal, a fiduciary, he he executor or trustee, must fall within the class of an \u201caggrieved\u201d party in interest or one \u201cwhose estate or trust is so aggrieved\u201d: Register of Wills Act, supra.\nInitially, we must inquire into the nature of the gift provided in the 20th paragraph of the will to determine Mosher\u2019s status thereunder. This gift was of the entire residuary estate and the language employed unequivocally indicates that the gift was not to Mosher but to \u201clocal charities\u201d of Erie. Which of the class of \u201clocal charities\u201d was to receive and how much each of the \u201clocal charities\u201d selected was to receive were expressly left by testator to Mosher\u2019s determination, choice and discretion and his conduct in making such determination. and choice and in the exercise of his discretion was not to be questioned. Under such testamentary provision, there can be no doubt of the charitable nature of the gift, that the executor, although not so eo nomine, was in fact a trustee to carry out the purposes of the gift and that the charitable objects within the class of \u201clocal charities\u201d remains unascertained until selected by Mosher.\nAlmost a century ago, this Court speaking through Justice (later Chief Justice) Sharswood, in Helfenstein\u2019s Estate, 77 Pa. 328, 331, said: \u201cThere is no prescribed form for the declaration of a trust.\u201d Such is-still the law. In Smith\u2019s Estate, 144 Pa. 428, 437, 22 A. 916, this Court quoted with approval from Bispham\u2019s Equity (p. 65) : \u201c \u2018Three things,\u2019 it has been said, \u2018must concur to raise a trust, sufficient words to create it, a definite subject, and a certain or ascertained object;\u2019 and to these requisites may be added another, viz., that the terms of the trust should be sufficiently declared\u201d and then the Court added \u201cany words which indicate with sufficient certainty a purpose to create a trust will be effective in so doing.\u201d See also: Ranney v. Byers, 219 Pa. 332, 68 A. 971; Evans Estate, 372 Pa. 284, 93 A. 2d 683. Appellee contends that the omission in the 20th paragraph of the words \u201cin trust\u201d or \u201ctrustee\u201d \u2014 especially in view of the presence of the words \u201cin trust\u201d in the 19th paragraph \u2014 negatives the existence of a trust. Such contention lacks merit. While the presence or absence of the words \u201cin trust\u201d or \u201ctrustee\u201d must be given consideration, the presence or the absence of such words is not controlling in determining the existence or nonexistence of a trust: Tunnell\u2019s Estate, 325 Pa. 554, 190 A. 906; Sheets\u2019 Estate, 52 Pa. 257.\nThe provisions in the 20th paragraph are not novel. We have construed similar provisions as creating charitable trusts and considered the executors therein to be acting in the capacity of trustees: Kinike\u2019s Estate, 155 Pa. 101, 25 A. 1016 (testator directed the executors \u201cto distribute [the residuary estate] among such charitable institutions, and in such proportions as they in their discretion deem proper\u201d) ; Murphy\u2019s Estate, 184 Pa. 310, 311, 39 A. 70 (testator directed the residuary estate \u201cbe divided among such benevolent, charitable and religious institutions and associations as shall be selected by my executors, or their successors\u201d) ; Dulles\u2019s Estate, 218 Pa. 162, 164, 67 A. 49 (testatrix directed her executors \u201cto pay over, appropriate, dispose of and distribute [the residuary estate] . . . among such religious, charitable and benevolent purposes and objects or persons or institutions\u201d as testatrix would specify in writing, or, if she did not so specify, then in the executors\u2019 discretion).\nA study of the 20th paragraph of the will indicates that, while Mosher is nominally an executor, actually he is a trustee clothed with the duties of a trustee. In such posture, we determine his standing to appeal from the probate of this codicil.\nIf the codicil stands, the provisions of the 20th paragraph are cancelled and the charitable trust therein provided never comes into existence. To the extent that the codicil prevails, the testator\u2019s intentions expressed in the 20th paragraph of this eoncededly valid will are frustrated, the trust fails and the as-yet-unascertained \u201clocal charities\u201d are deprived of the residuary estate. Such \u201clocal charities\u201d are without standing to appeal (cf. Atlee Estate, 406 Pa. 528, 178 A. 2d 722), although the Attorney General as parens patriae may represent their interest. Under such circumstances, does Mosher, in his capacity of trustee, have standing to appeal from the probate of this codicil destructive of the trust, the testator\u2019s expressed intent and the \u201clocal charities\u201d interests?\nOther jurisdictions have been presented with this problem. Estate of Ferrall, 33 Cal. 2d 202, 200 P. 2d 1, 3, held that one acting as trustee may appeal in his representative capacity if it is necessary to prevent the termination of a trust, the Court (speaking through Justice Traynor) stating that such appeal was the \u201cperformance of a duty by the trustees to protect the trust against an attack that goes to the very existence of the trust itself.\u201d In Toledo Trust Co. v. Farmer, 165 Ohio St. 378, 135 N.E. 2d 356, 357, the Court held that where \u201ca judgment affects or threatens the existence, validity or continuance of a trust or prevents the trustee from discharging his duties thereunder, or where such judgment threatens to defeat the purpose of the trust, the trustee, although having no personal interest in the litigation, is not a disinterested party, is aggrieved by the judgment and may appeal therefrom in his fiduciary or representative capacity.\u201d In Estate of Bunn, 33 Cal. 2d 897, 206 P. 2d 635, where the residuary estate was to be \u201csold and given to a worthy charity selected by my executors\u201d and the court below held that no charitable trust had been created, the Court held that, since the decree went to the very existence of the trust, the executors had not only the right but the duty to protect the trust.\nA case most apposite to the case at bar is O\u2019Leary v. McGuinness, 140 Conn. 80, 98 A. 2d 660. Testatrix in her will gave her residuary estate \u201cto [her] executors\u201d to be paid by them to such charities as they in their absolute discretion shall unanimously select or in \u201cthe event that [her] charitable purpose, as above stated, fails\u201d then testatrix gave the residuary estate to the executors or the survivor of them absolutely, \u201cconfident that they . . . will carry out [her charitable] wishes.\u201d A year later a codicil was made which changed executors and modified the will by providing that only such charities might be selected as are organizations, gifts to which are deductible under the federal estate tax. The Court, noting that the provisions of the will created a charitable trust even though the word \u201ctrust\u201d was not contained therein and holding that the executor under the will could appeal from the probate of the codicil, stated (p. 664) : \u201cThe law, therefore, is well settled that a trustee under a will has a duty to protect the interests of the beneficiaries of the trust. Where those interests are adversely affected by a later will or codicil, he is aggrieved by a probate decree allowing the later will or codicil so that he may appeal therefrom. A trustee of a charitable trust has a special duty to protect the interests of the beneficiaries because the real beneficiaries are unascertainable and, therefore unable to protect themselves, [citing a case]. The plaintiff [executor] is a trustee who is in that position. It can make no difference that the attorney general may also have the right of appeal, as suggested by the defendants. That does not relieve the plaintiff of his duty. His is the primary obligation\u201d.\nWe need not rely, however, on these decisions from other jurisdictions, compelling in their reasoning as they are, because the language of our statute (Register of Wills Act, supra), i.e., \u201ca fiduciary whose estate or trust is so aggrieved\u201d and the rationale of our case law (Elliott Estate, 388 Pa. 321, 325, 131 A. 2d 357; Neafie\u2019s Estate, 199 Pa. 307, 49 A. 129) compels our recognition of Mosher\u2019s right to appeal from the probate of this codicil which cancels the charitable trust. Cf. Gulden Estate, 86 Pa. D. & C. 262; Hetzel\u2019s Estate, 37 Pa. D. & C. 440, 446, 447.\nThe fact that the Attorney General, as parens patriae, represents the interests of the unascertained \u201clocal charities\u201d does not foreclose Mosher\u2019s right of appeal. The Attorney General represents the public interest in a charitable trust rather than a particular class of potential beneficiaries and his representation does not affect Mosher\u2019s rights: Howard Savings Institution v. Peep, 34 N.J. 494, 170 A. 2d 39; Ripley v. Brown, 218 Mass. 33, 105 N.E. 637; O\u2019Leary v. McGuinness, supra.\nIn sustaining the preliminary objections upon the ground that Mosher lacked standing to appeal from the probate of the codicil, the court below erred and its decree in this respect must be reversed.\nCertain other matters remain for our consideration. The preliminary objections further questioned the sufficiency of Mosher\u2019s appeal petition on the ground that the petition did not allege sufficient factual support for its averments of lack of testamentary capacity and undue influence. The court below, relying on Shaffer\u2019s Estate, 332 Pa. 225, 2 A. 2d 764, and Hochberger Estate, No. 2, 72 Pa. D. & C. 454, held that the appeal petition was deficient in this respect and upheld the preliminary objections as to Mosher on this ground; in so doing, the court below acted correctly. However, the order of the court then dismissed the appeal petition without giving Mosher any opportunity to amend the petition for the purpose of averring, in a concise and brief manner, the facts and circumstances upon which he based the averments of lack of testamentary capacity and undue influence. The dismissal of the appeal petition was too drastic under the circumstances and an opportunity to amend should have been granted. In dismissing the petition, the court below fell into error and its decree in this respect must also be reversed.\nMosher\u2019s appeal from the probate of the codicil in the court below was followed by several motions on his part seeking discovery by way of depositions and by the production and inspection of documents. The court below refused, in separate orders, such motions principally on the ground that they sought discovery in too broad a manner. At this time, we need not pass on the propriety of the court\u2019s action in this respect in view of our disposition of this matter by way of remand to the court below.\nFrom a study of this record and the applicable case law, two conclusions are inevitable: first, that Mosher does have standing to appeal from the probate of the codicil and, second, that Mosher must aver in an amended appeal petition sufficient facts and circumstances to support his averments of lack of testamentary capacity and undue influence. Such conclusions compel that we remand the matter for further proceeding in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Erie County.\nSince we are remanding this matter for further proceedings and since it is inevitable that, either for the preparation of pleadings or the preparation for and trial of the cause, further attempts at discovery will be made, it may not be amiss to point out that, since there is a pending action, the Orphans\u2019 Court has the power to enforce discovery sought in an appropriate manner. (20 P.S. \u00a72080.742; Sup. Ct. O.C. Rules, \u00a73, Rule 6; Cole v. Wells, 406 Pa. 81, 91, 177 A. 2d 77). Nothing in this opinion shall be construed as a bar to the allowance of discovery if the matters sought are relevant to the issue of the cause. While \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d are not to be countenanced under the guise of discovery, requests for discovery must be considered with liberality as the rule rather than the exception.\nThe case at bar is one of grave concern and importance. The circumstances presented on this record are such as demand that all parties be given their \u201cday in court\u201d. We in no manner presume to pass upon the merits of this controversy; we simply note that this record portrays a situation requiring on the part of the Orphans\u2019 Court the strictest of scrutiny that the rights of the \u201clocal charities\u201d of Erie, of Myra Parkhurst, of Mosher and of all other parties concerned be fully protected.\nDecree reversed and the matter remanded to the Orphans\u2019 Court of Erie County for proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion. Costs to abide the event.\nConsisting of the bulk of an estate valued in excess of $700,-000.\nGreenwood, witnessed the 1959 will.\nUnder the 4th paragraph of the will, testator permitted his housekeeper, Mary Verstreet, to occupy certain realty during her lifetime and spinsterhood and directed that the property, after her death, be sold and the proceeds given to a charity, St. Barnabas House, North East, Pennsylvania: Item I of the codicil cancelled the 4th paragraph of the will and substituted therefor a new paragraph wherein testator gave his \u201cstocks, corporate bonds, and U.. S. Government Bonds\u201d to one Myra Parkhurst. Under the 16th paragraph of the will certain valuable antique items were given to the Erie Public Museum, owned by the Erie Oity School District; this gift was cancelled by Item V of the codicil.\nThere is no doubt that if the codicil is valid, testator\u2019s testamentary disposition to charities of his residuary estate under the will is \u25a0 completely nullified. Unlike the duty imposed upon the executor, by the terms of the will, to dispose of the residuary estate to -local charities in Erie, the codicil gives the residuary estate outright and in fee to Myra Parkhurst and any disposition of any part of the residuary estate to charities \u2014 any charities as contrasted with local charities \u2014 is made dependent on the whim of Myra Parkhurst and is in no sense mandatory. Under the codicil charity could well begin at home for Myra Parkhurst. Cf. Wilbur\u2019s Estate, 334 Pa. 45, 78, 79, 5 A. 2d 325.\nAverments in paragraph 2 of the petition of appeal from probate.\nThe petition further avers that Myra Parkhurst, an Erie nonresident, came to Erie in April 1962; that within a month she moved into testator\u2019s home; removed his housekeeper; secured his power of attorney; entered testator\u2019s safe deposit boxes; secured the right to draw his checks; secured the execution of the codicil; then was ordered out of his home by testator. Myra Parkhurst was not related by blood to testator.\nIn an opinion labeled \u201cOpinion No. 3\u201d.\nAs was said in Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society\u2019s Appeal, 30 Pa. 425, 435: \u201c. . . individual designation is left to the-trustee, wlio is tie dispenser of the bounty, and who is under obligation to dispense within the class\u201d.\nSee also: Schleicher\u2019s Estate, 201 Pa. 612, 51 A. 329; DeSilver\u2019s Estate, 211 Pa. 459, 60 A. 1048; Kimberly\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 249 Pa. 469, 95 A. 82; Barnwell\u2019s Estate, 269 Pa. 443, 112 A. 535; Thompson\u2019s Estate, 282 Pa. 30, 127 A. 446; Voegtly Estate, 396 Pa. 90, 151 A. 2d 593; Little Estate, 403 Pa. 247, 168 A. 2d 738. Cf. Beck\u2019s Appeal, 116 Pa. 547, 9 A. 942; Watts\u2019s Estate, 202 Pa. 85, 51 A. 588.\nWhat testator gave Mosher was not a discretion to distribute the residuary estate willy-nilly. On the contrary, testator clearly indicated his intent that the \u201clocal charities\u201d of Brie were to be the beneficiaries of the residuary estate and testator entrusted Mosher with the duty to carry out such purpose, leaving to him the selection of the particular \u201clocal charities\u201d and the division among such \u201clocal charities\u201d. Cf. McCurdy\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 99, 112, 113, 16 A. 626.\nSee also: Howard Savings Institution v. Peep, 34 N.J. 494, 170 A. 2d 39; Jackson v.

App.), 303 S.W. 2d 217; 4 Am. Jur. 2d \u00a7\u00a7206, 213; 6 A.L.R. 2d 152.\nIn the case at bar, the Attorney General took no appeal. Mosher argues that the Attorney General is faced with a conflict of interest in that the Commonwealth, on the basis of the validity of the codicil, has already received $90,000 on account of the estate\u2019s tax liability and that, if the codicil prevails, the Commonwealth is enriched taxwise whereas, if the codicil fails, the Commonwealth will lose taxwise. This argument lacks appeal. We are fully satisfied that the Attorney General has and will continue to hold paramount his duty as parens patriae and that he will not be influenced by any interest in tax gathering on the part of the Commonwealth.\nThe contention of appellee as to prematurity of this appeal has been considered and dismissed."}
