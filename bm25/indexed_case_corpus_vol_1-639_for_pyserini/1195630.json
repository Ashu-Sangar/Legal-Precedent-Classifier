{"id": "1195630", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe court below held that a letter from decedent to his sister, stating \u201cI am making out my will leaving my securities to you,\u201d where no such will was found, did not itself constitute a will. As the writing manifestly referred to another paper as decedent\u2019s will, the decision of the court below is clearly correct, and no discussion is necessary. See Stein\u2019s Lessee v. North, 3 Yeates 324, 325; McCune\u2019s Estate, 265 Pa. 523, 528; Kaufman\u2019s Estate, 283 Pa. 375, 377.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost."}
