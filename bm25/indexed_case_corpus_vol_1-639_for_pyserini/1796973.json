{"id": "1796973", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nToday we must determine the appropriate disciplinary sanctions to be imposed upon a member of the bar of this Commonwealth who has been convicted of federal drug charges.\nIn early 1982, Roger Simon (respondent), an attorney licensed to practice law in this Commonwealth, acted as a middle man for the sale and purchase of four ounces of cocaine. A client of respondent\u2019s, Michael Hasselhuhn, known as Big Mike, asked respondent if he could find someone to purchase cocaine from a friend of his, who was known as \u201cTrout.\u201d Respondent obtained a purchaser and went with Big Mike to the drug purchase armed with scales, a testing kit (known as a \u201chot box\u201d) and approximately $7,800-$8,000 to purchase the cocaine, which respondent would then deliver to the purchaser, one Ian Cohen. At the time of the drug purchase, one-half ounce of the cocaine was taken by Big Mike, with respondent\u2019s knowledge, to be sold on the streets and a cutting agent was substituted in its place. Respondent then delivered the cocaine to the purchaser, Ian Cohen. Respondent received no profit from the transaction.\nApproximately one and one-half years later, in October, 1983, respondent was confronted by the FBI concerning the drug purchase. Respondent discussed his involvement with the FBI and with Assistant United States District Attorney David Shipman, but refused to relinquish the name of the purchaser at that time because the government did not give him any \u201cconcrete benefit\u201d for doing so.\nA two count indictment was handed-down against respondent and a not guilty plea was entered. After jury trial, respondent was found guilty, on February 14, 1984, in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania of unlawfully, willfully and knowingly conspiring to import, distribute and possess with intent to distribute, and unlawfully, knowingly and intentionally possessing with intent to distribute, a Schedule II controlled substance, cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1), respectively.\nAs to count I, respondent was sentenced to three months imprisonment and a fine of $1,000. As to count II, respondent was sentenced to a two year term of imprisonment, suspended, and placed on probation for two years, commencing on his release from imprisonment, subject to the condition that respondent perform 200 hours of community service work. After sentencing, respondent was subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury. It was only then, when his testimony could be compelled, that he divulged the name of the purchaser.\nUpon notification of the conviction, a majority of this Court, by order dated May 21, 1984, immediately suspended respondent, pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Disciplinary Enforcement (Pa.R.D.E.) 214(d) which provides:\nUpon the filing with the Supreme Court of a certified copy of an order demonstrating that an attorney has been convicted of a crime which is punishable by imprisonment for one year or upward ... the Court may enter an order immediately suspending the attorney whether the conviction resulted from a plea of guilty of nolo contendere or from a verdict after trial or otherwise, pending final disposition of a disciplinary proceeding to be commenced upon such conviction.\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel (petitioner) then filed a petition for discipline against respondent on June 21, 1984. Petitioner charged respondent with violating the Code of Professional Responsibility which was adopted by this Court in 1974 and provides the minimum standards to which an attorney must adhere. Specifically, petitioner charged respondent with misconduct under Disciplinary Rule (DR) 1-102. That rule provides, in pertinent part, that a lawyer shall not \u201cengage in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude; engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice; [or] engage in conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law.\u201d DR 1-102(A)(3), (4), (5) and (6), respectively. Respondent filed an answer admitting all the factual allegations.\nTo implement and enforce these standards for attorneys, this Court promulgated the Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement (Pa.R.D.E.). These rules, inter alia, provide:\nRule 203. Grounds for Discipline\n(a) Acts or omissions by a person subject to these rules ... which violate the Disciplinary Rules, shall constitute misconduct and shall be grounds for discipline, whether or not the act or omission occurred in the course of an attorney-client relationship.\n(b) The following shall also be grounds for discipline:\n(1) Conviction of a crime which under Enforcement\nRule 214 (relating to attorneys convicted of crimes) may result in [interim] suspension.\nFurther; under Pa.R.D.E. 204, attorney misconduct under the Code of Professional Responsibility is grounds for the imposition of discipline ranging from private informal admonition by Disciplinary Counsel to disbarment by this Court. Pa.R.D.E. 204(a)(1)-(6).\nA three member hearing committee took testimony and heard arguments and, on March 22, 1985, found that respondent\u2019s conviction was a basis for the imposition of discipline, Pa.R.D.E. 203(b)(1), and that respondent had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice, a violation of DR 1-102(A)(5). The committee recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for eighteen (18) months, retroactive to May 21, 1984, the date of this Court\u2019s interim suspension order. The committee did not find a violation of the other disciplinary rules with which respondent had been charged.\nThe Disciplinary Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (Board) accepted the committee\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law in its report and recommendation to this Court. However, the Board recommended that respondent be suspended until June 27, 1986, or upon completion of his federal probation. Subsequently, this Court issued a rule to show cause upon respondent why he should not be disbarred, pursuant to Pa.R.D.E. 208(e)(3). After briefs and oral argument, this Court finds that disbarment is warranted.\nOur review of disciplinary matters is de novo. Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Troback, 477 Pa. 318, 383 A.2d 952 (1978); Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Campbell, 463 Pa. 472, 345 A.2d 616 (1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 926, 96 S.Ct. 1139, 47 L.Ed.2d 336 (1976). The primary purpose of the disciplinary system is to \u201c... determine the fitness of an attorney to continue the practice of law.\u201d Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Lucarini, 504 Pa. 271, 281, 472 A.2d 186, 190 (1983).\nA review of the record reveals the following facts. Respondent was admitted to practice law in 1973. Before and after graduation from law school, he was an employee of the Commonwealth. Upon terminating this employment in 1976, respondent commenced private practice, and remained in private practice until his suspension in May, 1984.\nDuring the time in question, spring 1981 through spring 1982, respondent experienced \u201cpersonal problems.\u201d His wife lost her job. A subsequent business venture that she and respondent embarked on with others failed. Respondent\u2019s father had suffered from a terminal illness and respondent assumed care of an emotionally disturbed first cousin who had been raised by respondent\u2019s family. Additionally, sometime in the fall of 1981, respondent discovered that his partner was stealing from the firm\u2019s escrow account and by January 1982, respondent severed his partnership and undertook his own practice.\nAccording to respondent, these problems caused him to feel that he had \u201cno place to go\u201d and he began to \u201chang around\u201d with Big Mike as an \u201cescape.\u201d Respondent admits that Big Mike was \u201cimmoral\u201d and manipulative, yet he found him entertaining. Big Mike\u2019s \u201centertainment\u201d included bragging to respondent how he would steal his father\u2019s drugs and sell them when he was in high school.\nBig Mike approached respondent concerning the sale of approximately $8,000 worth of cocaine. According to respondent, he was approached because, \u201c... he knew, obviously that I was a lawyer ...\u201d and \u201c... one of the people ... at that time who had associations with people with money, wealthy people.\u201d Respondent then supplied a purchaser for the cocaine.\nRespondent\u2019s reasons for becoming involved in the drug deal were, \u201c... I did it because I wanted to help both of them (the purchaser, Ian Cohen and the seller\u2019s agent, Big Mike). I did it because of the intrigue. It was a part of life I had never seen. I did it for the escape. I did it to see if I had the guts \u2014 this sounds stupid \u2014 to do something that was inherently dangerous.\u201d Respondent admits that he knowingly and intentionally took part in a \u201ccriminal and illegal\u201d activity.\nRespondent\u2019s defense was an attempt to show that he was basically a \u201cgood guy\u201d and that his problems overwhelmed him. Respondent had a \u201cclose family.\u201d His father, brother and sister were also attorneys. He was active in social and religious affairs, helping Jewish immigrants resettle in Harrisburg and participating in various B\u2019Nai B\u2019Rith programs.\nRespondent's practice was not financially renumerative and he depended, to an extent, on his wife's income. Respondent\u2019s reputation among his clients and colleagues was and remains good.\nRespondent also added that when asked, six months later by the same purchaser, to procure more cocaine, he refused to do so; respondent\u2019s wife testified, however, that as to this refusal, respondent felt \u201cguilty\u201d in letting down his friend. There is no indication in the record why respondent, despite having a close family and playing an active role in his community and religion, could not or would not turn to them for his solace, rather than Big Mike.\nWhen respondent was questioned by the FBI in October, 1983, he refused to relinquish the name of the purchaser. It was not until after sentencing, when subpoenaed before a grand jury, that respondent released the name.\nWe are guided by the Ethical Considerations set forth in our Code of Professional Responsibility which, although deemed \u201caspirational in character\u201d, represent the objectives toward which an attorney should strive and provide guidance for an attorney\u2019s behavior. Code of Professional Responsibility, Preamble and Preliminary Statement (1974).\n\u201cMaintaining the integrity and improving the competence of the bar to meet the highest standards is the ethical responsibility of every lawyer.\u201d Code of Professional Responsibility EC 1-1 (1974). \u201cThe public should be protected from those who are not qualified to be lawyers by reason of a deficiency in education or moral standards ... but who nevertheless seek to practice law.\u201d Id. EC 1-2 (1974). An attorney \u201c... should refrain from all illegal and morally reprehensible conduct. Because of his position in society, even minor violations of law ... tend to lessen public confidence in the legal profession. Obedience to the law exemplifies respect for the law.\u201d Id. EC 1-5 (1974). Respondent\u2019s intentional participation in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine disregards each of these ethical considerations.\nRespondent\u2019s conviction of this serious crime, for which imprisonment of one year or more could have resulted (Pa.R.D.E.214) warrants the imposition of discipline under Pa.R.D.E. 203(b)(1) and is conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. DR 1-102(A)(5).\nAdditionally, we believe that respondent\u2019s conduct involved moral turpitude (DR 1-102(A)(3)) and adversely reflected on his fitness to practice law (DR 1-102(A)(6)).\n\u201cMoral turpitude is admittedly an elusive concept incapable of precise definition. Its definition may change with the times and vary from community to community.\u201d State of Oklahoma Bar Ass\u2019n v. Denton, 598 P.2d 663, 665 (Okla. 1979). Legally, moral turpitude is defined as \u201c... anything done knowingly contrary to justice, honesty, principle, or good morals.\u201d Muniz v. State, 575 S.W.2d 408, 411 (Texas 1978); See also Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1359 (5th ed.1979).\nRespondent freely admits that he intended his act as well as its consequences. Further, respondent admits that he knew that the transaction was \u201ccriminal\u201d and \u201cillegal.\u201d It is quite clear that respondent\u2019s conduct is conduct involving moral turpitude. Most jurisdictions have found similar attorney misconduct to involve moral turpitude.\nRespondent\u2019s involvement in a criminal act also adversely reflects on his ability to practice law. DR 1-102(A)(6). By his actions, respondent knowingly and intentionally shirked his responsibility as an officer of the court and exemplified disrespect for the laws which govern our society. Respondent asserts that his conduct does not impinge on his ability to practice law because his actions \u201cdid not involve or arise from his practice of law.\u201d Respondent\u2019s Brief at 34. We will not accept this distortion of DR 1-102(A)(6). The language of Pa.R.D.E. 203(a) clearly states to the contrary: violation of the disciplinary rules are misconduct and \u201cshall be grounds for discipline, whether or not the act or omission occurred in the course of an attorney-client relationship.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) As we stated in Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Grigsby, 493 Pa. 194, 425 A.2d 730 (1981), \"... we cannot distinguish between dishonesty involving client matters and dishonesty in private matters: the seriousness of respondent\u2019s misconduct is not lessened by the fact that the victims of his fraud were not his clients.\u201d Id., 493 Pa. at 200, 425 A.2d at 733.\nTo reach our determination that disbarment is warranted, we have examined \u201c... the underlying facts involved in the criminal charge [and weighed] the impact of the conviction upon the measure of discipline.\u201d Troback, supra, 383 A.2d at 953. It is for this reason that we cannot agree with the recommendation of the Disciplinary Board of a two year suspension. Facilitating the sale and purchase of cocaine, alone, warrants disbarment. This case, however, presents two aggravating circumstances: (1) respondent\u2019s knowledge and acquiescence in the one-half ounce of cocaine to be sold on the streets; and (2) respondent\u2019s refusal to tell the authorities the identity of the ultimate purchaser of the cocaine. In In re Gorman, 269 Ind. 236, 379 N.E.2d 970 (1978), respondent was convicted of possession with intent to distribute, distribution and conspiracy to distribute one gram of cocaine and was disbarred. As that court said:\nThese are not the acts of an experimenting youth. Respondent actively engaged himself in the introduction of a controlled substance into a market place that, unfortunately, is too often occupied by children and adolescents. He intentionally set in motion, without any apparent regard for the consequences, factors which could have serious impact on other societal members. By our society, through the enactment of laws, the use, possession and sale of cocaine have been deemed unwanted and illegal acts. By his conduct, the Respondent has attempted to place himself above the law and superior to societal judgments. These acts, being committed by an attorney, are evidence of a baseness, vileness, and depravity in the social and private duties which an attorney owes to his fellowman.\nId. 379 N.E.2d at 971-72 (emphasis supplied).\nMany different pressures come to bear on us during our daily lives, and each individual reacts differently. This Court is not unsympathetic with these stresses or the toll they may take. There are many socially acceptable means of attempting to deal with such pressures and this Court encourages their use. They are, among others, Alcoholics Anonymous, individual psychotherapy, group therapy and reliance upon family and friends for additional support. Respondent chose none of these and, instead, intentionally chose the \u201cexcitement\u201d, the \u201cintrigue\u201d and the \u201cchallenge\u201d of criminal activity. Respondent\u2019s conduct was despicable.\nThe Code of Professional Responsibility embodies the standards for attorneys practicing law in this Commonwealth so that the public is protected and the integrity of the bar preserved. Respondent has flaunted those standards and violated the Code of Professional Responsibility. There is no excuse, justification or mitigation that can overcome the seriousness of the crime committed by respondent.\nIt is therefore ordered that on this day respondent is disbarred. It is further ordered that respondent reimburse the costs of this proceeding pursuant to Pa.R.D.E. 208(g).\nMr. Justice Zappala filed a dissenting opinion in which\nMr. Justice Flaherty joined.\n. \u00a7 846. Attempt and conspiracy\nAny person who attempts or conspires to commit any offense defined in this subchapter is punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which may not exceed the maximum punishment prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.\n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (1982).\n\u00a7 841(a). Prohibited acts A\nUnlawful acts.\n(a) Except as authorized by this subchapter, it shall be unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally\u2014\n(1) to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance;\n21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (1982).\n. Respondent served a total of 81 days in a county jail while participating in a work-release program that allowed him to work five and one-half days a week, returning to jail in the evening.\n. Initially, respondent was a special legal counsel to the Act 13 Flood Grant Program, Department of Community Affairs and then acted as counsel for the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, Department of Labor and Industry.\n. There is no indication on the record of the type of business entered into by respondent and his wife.\n. Respondent\u2019s partner was subsequently disbarred on consent and respondent was not, in any way, implicated in the events leading to his partner's disbarment.\n. We are not persuaded by respondent\u2019s claim that his initial refusal to answer the FBI\u2019s questions constituted the assertion of a constitutional privilege \u2014 the Fifth Amendment. Respondent did not assert any constitutional privilege. He freely talked to the FBI about his participation in the crime. It is to his conduct that the Fifth Amendment applies; not to another\u2019s conduct.\n. Although there is, in the broadest sense, dishonesty involved in every crime, we do not (nor did the Board) find that respondent\u2019s conduct involved dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. To charge respondent with a violation of this rule under the facts presented in this case would be to make this rule too broad and all encompassing. The rule should be construed in its normal sense and \"dishonesty\" should not be taken out of context. Rather, it should be considered as it is commonly associated with those violations involving theft, misappropriation, etc. See, e.g., Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Lewis, 493 Pa. 519, 426 A.2d 1138 (1981).\n. Disciplinary Board of the Hawaii Sup. Ct. v. Bergan, 60 Hawaii 546, 592 P.2d 814 (1979), found misconduct involving, among other things, moral turpitude for the possession with intent to distribute 385 grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). In re Cohen, 113 Cal.Rptr. 485, 521 P.2d 477 (1974), found conduct involving moral turpitude when respondent assisted a friend in the transfer of approximately 42 kilos of marijuana for \"adventure.\u201d State of Oklahoma Bar Ass\u2019n v. Denton, 598 P.2d 663 (Okla.1979), found conduct involving moral turpitude for the possession of marijuana. In re Kreamer, 121 Cal.Rptr. 600, 535 P.2d 728 (1975), found conduct involving moral turpitude for the possession and possession with intent to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846. State ex rel. Nebraska State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Matt, 213 Neb. 123, 327 N.W.2d 622 (1982), found conduct involving moral turpitude when an attorney facilitated the sale of cocaine between two of his acquaintances because of friendship. \"... [Ajiding and abetting criminal dealings in controlled substances, whatever the motivation of an attorney may be, constitutes conduct involving moral turpitude and warrants disciplinary action.\" Matt, supra, 327 N.W.2d at 624."}
