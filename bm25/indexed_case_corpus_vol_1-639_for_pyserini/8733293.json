{"id": "8733293", "contents": "OPINION\nKAUFFMAN, Justice.\nOn February 24, 1976, appellant, Robert Stamps, was arrested and charged with possession and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance. A search, pursuant to warrant, had uncovered twenty-five (25) packets of heroin in appellant\u2019s apartment. A timely motion to suppress the evidence was filed, but after a hearing, denied. On October 29, 1976, appellant was tried without a jury and convicted on both charges. Post-trial motions were filed, and on April 19, 1977, an arrest of judgment was granted with respect to the charge of possession with intent to deliver; all other motions, however, were denied and a sentence of six to twelve months was imposed. Thereafter, an appeal was taken to the Superior Court, and the judgment of sentence was affirmed. Commonwealth v. Stamps, 260 Pa.Super. 108, 393 A.2d 1035 (1978). We granted allocatur and now affirm.\nOn Thursday, February 19, 1976, a reliable informant told Police Officer Victor Marcone (1) that \u201cin the past 10 days\u201d he had been inside appellant\u2019s second floor apartment at 1211 South 47th Street in Philadelphia; (2) that he had observed appellant with approximately ten bundles of heroin in his possession; (3) that appellant told him he was going to sell the \u201cstuff\u201d in one-half hour for $800.00 to a person named \u201cRoy;\u201d (4) that he also had seen appellant on another occasion leave his apartment with three bundles of heroin to sell to two different persons; (5) that customers \u201calways\u201d called appellant\u2019s telephone number before visiting his apartment to purchase drugs.\nThereafter, on Monday, February 23, 1976 from 11:20 a. m. to 11:50 a. m., police conducted a surveillance of the building in which appellant\u2019s apartment was located. At that time, they observed two persons enter the building and leave after a short period. On the basis of an affidavit prepared by Officer Marcone immediately after conducting the surveillance, a search warrant was issued on February 23, 1976. The following day Officer Marcone went to appellant\u2019s apartment building with the warrant, knocked on the front door, identified himself as a police officer, and waited for about two and one-half minutes before being admitted. While waiting, he heard someone running from the door.\nAfter being admitted by appellant, Officer Marcone proceeded upstairs to appellant\u2019s second floor apartment, where he discovered a second male sitting in the kitchen staring into an open oven. Another man then walked down from the third floor apartment into the kitchen of appellant\u2019s apartment. Thereafter, Officer Marcone searched the apartment and found twenty-five packets of heroin under the cushion of a couch located in the \u201ccombination parlor-bedroom.\u201d He also discovered a telephone bill and an electric bill for the apartment addressed to appellant. After he was arrested, appellant, who kept his clothing in the kitchen and in the parlor-bedroom, was permitted to dress.\nAppellant here raises two issues: (1) whether the affidavit prepared by Officer Marcone was based on stale information which could not support a finding of probable cause, and (2) whether the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to establish appellant\u2019s possession of contraband in light of the presence of other persons in the apartment at the time of the search.\nI\nThe probable cause portion of the affidavit provided:\nI Plcm. # 4334 having received information from a reliable informant 2-19/76 that he was inside of the above location in the past 10 days and did see [Robert Stamps] have in his possession approx. 10 bundles of alleged Heroin which he stated to the informant was for one person named Roy who was coming over in a half an hour to buy the stuff for $800.00. This informant stated that there were approx, five other person [sic] in this apt. and that he would not be shore [sic] who to blame if it link [sic] out to the cops about this certain transaction. The informant also stated that he on another date seen the above named person called (BROTHER ROB) leave this apt. with three bundles of heroin on his possession and was going to the bar to sell them to two different persons. This informant also stated that this person [sic] phone number was 349-8533 and that before any of the aboves [sic] customers come over they always call. This informant in the past two years has given me information which has resulted in a number of arrests with evidence confiscated on all arrests. A check with the phone company of the number supplied to me by this informant was made and found it to be in the name of the above living at the above location. On 2/23/76 from approx. 11:20 a. m. to 11:50 a. m. a surveillance was conducted at the above location and two persons were seen entering and leaving this location after staying only a short period of time, one of the persons being a white male. Due to the information received from this reliable informant along with a phone check an [sic] a surveillance I believe that the above named person is selling and storing large quantities of Heroin from inside of his apartment.\nAppellant contends that the informant\u2019s observation of criminal conduct no more than fourteen days prior to the issuance of the warrant was too remote to support a finding of probable cause at time of issuance, and that the evidence discovered pursuant to the warrant therefore should have been suppressed. We disagree.\nIt is well settled that for a search warrant to be constitutionally valid, the issuing authority must decide that probable cause exists at the time of its issuance. This determination must be based on facts described within the four corners of the supporting affidavit, see Commonwealth v. Simmons, 450 Pa. 624, 626, 301 A.2d 819, 820 (1973); Pa.R.Crim.P. 2003(a), and closely related in time to the date of issuance of the warrant. Sgro v. United States, 287 U.S. 206, 53 S.Ct. 138, 77 L.Ed. 260 (1932); Commonwealth v. Tolbert, 492 Pa. 576, 424 A.2d 1342 (1981); Commonwealth v. Jackson, 461 Pa. 632, 337 A.2d 582, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 999, 96 S.Ct. 432, 46 L.Ed.2d 376 (1975); Commonwealth v. Eazer, 455 Pa. 320, 312 A.2d 398 (1973); Commonwealth v. Simmons, 450 Pa. 624, 301 A.2d 819 (1973); Commonwealth v. Shaw, 444 Pa. 110, 281 A.2d 897 (1971). Otherwise, evidence of criminal activity \u201c. . . will become so attenuated with the passage of time as to be nonexistent at the time the warrant is applied for and is issued.\u201d\nCourts have been reluctant, however, to set a hard and fast rule as to what constitutes staleness; such a determination must be made on a case by case basis. Mere lapse of time between discovery of criminal activity and issuance of the warrant will not necessarily dissipate probable cause; a showing that the criminal activity is likely to have continued up to the time of issuance of the warrant will render otherwise stale information viable. United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 579 n.2, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 2079 n.2, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971); see Tolbert, 492 Pa. at 579, 424 A.2d at 1344; Eazer, 455 Pa. at 324, 312 A.2d at 400; Shaw, 444 Pa. at 113-14, 281 A.2d at 899.\nIn United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971), an affidavit similar to the one now. before us declared that a reliable informant had purchased liquor illegally from the accused \u201cwithin the past two weeks,\u201d and that he had also made similar purchases for a period of over two years. Rejecting the accused\u2019s contention that the information was stale, the Supreme Court of the United States concluded that there was a reasonable basis for the search. Likewise, in United States v. Johnson, 461 F.2d 285, 287 (10th Cir. 1972), an affidavit in support of a search warrant recited approximately four observations of illegal whiskey sales from June to September, 1970. Although the last observation occurred three weeks before issuance of the warrant, the Court held that the affidavit established probable cause since it \u201c. . . properly recite[d] facts indicating activity of a protracted and continuous nature . . .,\u201d thereby making the passage of time less significant than in the case of an isolated observation.\nIn determining whether the affidavit in question was sufficient to establish probable cause, we recognize that affidavits supporting search warrants normally are prepared \u201c. . . by nonlawyers in the midst and haste of a criminal investigation.\u201d United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. 102, 108, 85 S.Ct. 741, 745, 13 L.Ed.2d 684 (1965). They therefore should be interpreted in a \u201ccommon sense and realistic\u201d fashion rather than in a hypertechnical manner. Ventresca, 380 U.S. at 108, 85 S.Ct. at 745; Commonwealth v. Greco, 465 Pa. 400, 406, 350 A.2d 826, 829 (1976); Commonwealth v. Matthews, 446 Pa. 65, 71, 285 A.2d 510, 513 (1971). Moreover, the probable cause determination of the issuing authority must be accorded great deference. Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 419, 89 S.Ct. 584, 590, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969); Ventresca, 380 U.S. at 108-09, 85 S.Ct. at 745-46; see Matthews, 446 Pa. at 71, 285 A.2d at 513.\nHere, the affidavit reported that the informant had been inside appellant\u2019s apartment \u201cin the past 10 days\u201d and had observed appellant in possession of large quantities of heroin for sale on two separate occasions: (1) appellant told the informant he was going to sell ten bundles of heroin in \u201chalf an hour\u201d to a person named \u201cRoy\u201d, for $800.00; (2) the informant saw appellant leave his apartment with three bundles of heroin for sale to two other people. These incidents revealed on-going possession of large quantities of heroin for sale within fourteen days prior to the issuance of the warrant. Under these circumstances, we conclude that the issuing authority reasonably determined appellant was engaged in a continuing course of illegal conduct and that narcotic drugs were likely to be present in his apartment on the day the warrant was issued. Accordingly, we hold that probable cause was established and that the search warrant was validly issued.\nII\nRelying on our decisions in Commonwealth v. Fortune, 456 Pa. 365, 318 A.2d 327 (1974); Commonwealth v. Davis, 444 Pa. 11, 280 A.2d 119 (1971); and Commonwealth v. Tirpak, 441 Pa. 534, 272 A.2d 476 (1971), appellant next contends that since two other parties present in his apartment at the time of the search had equal access to the area where the contraband was found, the evidence at trial was insufficient to convict him of illegal possession of heroin. We recognize that \u201c. . . the fact of possession loses all persuasiveness if persons other than the accused had equal access ... to the place in which the property was discovered . . . . \u201d Fortune, 456 Pa. at 369, 318 A.2d at 329, Davis 444 Pa. at 16, 280 A.2d at 121. Here, however, we disagree with appellant\u2019s assertion that two other parties had equal access to the parlor-bedroom. The evidence was sufficient to establish that appellant was the sole tenant of the apartment, and exclusive control over the contents of a residence may properly be inferred from a showing that the accused is the only occupant or tenant of that residence. Commonwealth v. DeCampli, 243 Pa.Super. 69, 364 A.2d 454 (1976); State v. Brown, 80 N.J. 587, 404 A.2d 1111 (1979).\nOur standard of review in determining the sufficiency of the evidence is:\nwhether, accepting as true all of the evidence, be it direct or circumstantial, and all reasonable inferences arising therefrom upon which, if believed, the trier of facts could properly have based the verdict, it is sufficient in law to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of the crime or crimes of which he has been convicted. (Citations omitted)\nCommonwealth v. Malone, 444 Pa. 397, 398, 281 A.2d 866, 867 (1971). Considered in this light, we conclude that the evidence and the \u201creasonable inferences arising therefrom,\u201d were sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant, as the sole tenant of the apartment, was in constructive possession of the heroin hidden under a sofa cushion in the parlor-bedroom of that apartment. The cases cited by appellant are inapposite.\nIn Fortune, supra, we reversed the conviction of the owner and resident of a two-story private home for illegal possession of narcotic drugs when she was upstairs at the time police entered and four other persons were downstairs with greater access to the kitchen floor area where the drugs were found. As in Fortune, the accused in the instant case was the sole resident of the premises where the contraband was discovered. The similarity, however, ends there. In Fortune, the drugs were found in plain view in an area to which the four other parties present had more immediate access than the owner. Here, however, there is no evidence that either of the two other parties present at the time of the search had more immediate access than appellant to the area where the drugs were found.\nIn Davis, supra, we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for illegal possession of stolen goods where they were found in a locked cupboard in the basement of an apartment building in which his mistress lived. Unlike the instant case, there was no evidence that the defendant had any type of possessory interest in the building, nor was there any evidence that he had access to the locked cupboard in the basement.\nLikewise, in Tirpaek, supra, the convictions of four defendants were reversed where none of them had a possesso-ry interest in the premises and the area in which drugs were found was equally accessible to other persons present at a party.\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nNIX, J., concurs in the results.\nO\u2019BRIEN, C. J., and ROBERTS, J., filed dissenting opinions.\n. The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, Act of April 14, 1972, P.L. 233, No. 64, \u00a7 13, as amended, Act of October 26, 1972, P.L. 1048, No. 263, \u00a7 1, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113.\n. The evidence was found to be insufficient to show an intent to deliver or sell.\n. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 724(a).\n. Appellant does not challenge the reliability of the informant who, on a number of occasions over the past two years, had provided police with reliable information concerning criminal activity.\n. Officer Marcone confirmed that the telephone number supplied by the informant was registered in appellant\u2019s name at his 47th Street address.\n. When asked by the officer why he was staring into the oven, this person replied that he was \u201cmeditating.\u201d\n. The officer described the area as a \u201ccombination parlor-bedroom\u201d because the apartment contained no separate sleeping area.\n. U.S.Const. amend. IV. \u201cProbable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the affiant\u2019s knowledge and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information are sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that a search should be conducted.\u201d Commonwealth v. Thomas, 448 Pa. 42, 52, 292 A.2d 352, 357 (1972).\n. Mascolo, The Staleness of Probable Cause in Affidavits for Search Warrants: Resolving the Issue of Timeliness, 43 Conn.B.J. 189, 190 (1969).\n. See Eazer, 455 Pa. at 324, 312 A.2d at 400; Shaw, 444 Pa. at 114, 281 A.2d at 899; United States v. Dauphinee, 538 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1976); See also 100 A.L.R.2d 534 and authorities cited therein.\n. Cf. Gossett v. Commonwealth, Ky., 426 S.W.2d 485 (1968) (informant\u2019s single observation \u201cin the last 10 days\u201d of whiskey on premises for illegal sale was not too remote to establish probable cause.)\n. Although the language is somewhat ambiguous on this point, we conclude that a fair reading of the affidavit as a whole places both observations within the ten day period referred to by the informant.\n. Under these circumstances, we need not reach the issue of whether the surveillance had any probative value. We note, however, that we are unwilling to infer from the mere fact that a surveillance was conducted that the police lacked probable cause without it.\n. One of the parties was on the third floor when police entered appellant\u2019s apartment, the other was sitting in the kitchen staring into the oven, and in his Brief, appellant refers to them as \u201cinvitees\u201d.\n. Both the telephone and electric bills for the apartment were in appellant\u2019s name and his clothes were kept there. See Davis, 444 Pa. at 16, 280 A.2d at 121 (indicating that utility and telephone bills in apartment are indicia of possessory interest therein.)\n. Appellant also relies on Commonwealth v. Schulhoff, 218 Pa.Super. 209, 275 A.2d 835 (1971) where the court reversed the conviction of the tenant of an apartment for possession of narcotics. At the time police executed the search, four persons, including the tenant and his co-tenant, were sleeping in rooms other than the living room where the contraband was discovered. Significantly, in that case, there was a co-tenant who undoubtedly had equal access to the common living room area. Here, however, there is no evidence that either of the two persons present in appellant\u2019s apartment was a co-tenant. Nor is there evidence that either had any access to the parlor-bedroom."}
