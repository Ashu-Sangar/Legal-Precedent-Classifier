{"id": "462763", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Linn,\nThe administratrix of .0. Arthur Holton, deceased, appeals in a proceeding to determine whether the administratrix or a rival claimant named Betty Heyler, is entitled to insurance proceeds payable on a group insurance policy issued by Equitable Life Assurance Society to Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, Holton\u2019s employer. Jury trial was waived. The learned court below found in favor of Betty Heyler. The question is: Was the administratrix or Betty Heyler named beneficiary?\nThe Society issued its group policy insuring \u201cthe lives of all eligible employees of Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, . . . hereinafter called the employer, who shall have made written election as certified by the Employer to the Society, to participate in. the Group Life Insurance specified . . .\u201d The policy provided for the payment to the \u201c. . . person or persons entitled thereto under the provisions of this policy . . .\u201d One provision was that \u201cThe beneficiary shall be the person or persons designated on the Employer\u2019s records in accordance with the employee\u2019s election.\u201d The employee had a right to change the beneficiary \u201c. . . by written notice to the Employer signed by the employee and such change shall become effective only upon its entry by the Employer on the insurance records maintained by it in connection with the insurance under this policy.\u201d It was agreed that \u201cIf there be no beneficiary designated by the employee or surviving . . ., payment will be made to . . . the employee\u2019s ... (e) executors or administrators.\u201d Among \u201cSpecial Provisions\u201d were the following: \u201c2. Contract. This policy, and the Employer\u2019s application submitted in connection therewith, shall constitute the entire contract between the parties. . .\u201d\n\u201c4. Certificates and Conversions. The Society will issue to the Employer for delivery to each employee whose life is insured under this policy, an individual certificate setting forth a statement as to the insurance protection to which such employee is entitled under the terms hereof, and to whom it is payable, together with a provision to the effect that in case of the termination of the employment for any reason whatsoever while insured hereunder, the employee shall be entitled to have issued to him by the Society,. . . [on conditions not now involved] an individual policy of life insurance . . . [on conditions not involved] . . .\u201d\nHolton became insured under the group policy March 1, 1936; he died July 18, 1942, unmarried and without issue. His election to accept insurance appears on a document signed about February 18,1936, entitled \u201cAcceptance and Payroll Deduction Authority,\u201d hereafter called Acceptance card. It consisted of a form having various blanks to be filled in. Three of the blanks with the entries made in them have present importance. One required the \u201cfull name of beneficiary.\u201d In that blank, Holton wrote the name \u201cBetty Heyler.\u201d The next line required the insertion of the \u201crelationship to employee\u201d to the beneficiary. On that line he wrote the word \u201cEstate.\u201d The third line required the \u201cAddress of Beneficiary\u201d; on that line he wrote \u201c102 North 18th St., Phila. Pa.\u201d A boarding house or hotel was conducted at 102 North 18th Street, Philadelphia, Pa., and both he and Betty Heyler resided there. He signed that paper and delivered it to his employer.\nIn 1940, Holton left the employ of the shipbuilding company and thereby automatically terminated his insurance. He returned to work June 18, 1940, and reinstated the insurance by signing a \u201cRequest For Group Insurance Reinstatement . . . with beneficiary designation thereon set forth.\u201d\nThe employer maintained what was called in the record, an \u201cinsurance registry card.\u201d Among other data, this card contains the name of the insured and his certificate number; it stated that the beneficiary is \u201cThe Insured\u2019s executors or administrators.\u201d It shows the insured\u2019s reinstatement on June 18, 1940, and other information that need,not now be recited. Pursuant to the provision in the policy quoted above, the Society had issued a certificate which, we assume, was issued '\u201cto the Employer for delivery to\u201d the employee, Holton, setting forth what is stated in the provision quoted from the group policy. In this certificate the beneficiary was designated to be \u201cThe Insured\u2019s Executors or Administrators.\u201d This certificate was found by the coroner after Holton\u2019s death in Holton\u2019s room at 102 North 18th Street, Philadelphia, \u201c. . . in the top right-hand drawer of a buffet or whatever you call it in the room.\u201d The certificate is dated March 1,1936.\nThe Acceptance card containing the name Betty Heyler on the line designated to receive the \u201cfull name of beneficiary\u201d and the word \u201cEstate\u201d on the line designated to receive the \u201crelationship to employee,\u201d is ambiguous and leaves uncertain what Holton meant when he elected to be insured. This uncertainty was detected before the Society\u2019s certificate dated March T, 1936, was issued. The record contains a letter dated February 26,1936, from an employee of the Society to its assistant division group manager in Philadelphia stating: \u201cWe note the beneficiary of O. Arthur Holton, #2547A-784 was given as 'Betty Heyler \u2014 Estate.\u2019 We assume the employee is naming his Estate as beneficiary, and have issued the certificate accordingly. If this is in accordance with the employee\u2019s wishes, please have the attached Or. 205 form signed by the employee, and the form should be retained by the Company for their records.\u201d The record does not disclose what, if any, action was taken pursuant to that letter .but, that some act resulted, may be inferred from the fact that the insured\u2019s registry card designated the beneficiary as \u201cthe Insured\u2019s executors or administrators\u201d and from the fact that the 'certificate dated March 1, 1936, also so designated the. beneficiary.\nThe learned trial judge, reading the words of the policy that \u201c. . . the beneficiary shall be the person or persons designated in the Employer\u2019s records in accordance with the employee\u2019s election,\u201d with the fact that Holton wrote the name Betty Heyler as beneficiary on the Acceptance card, concluded that she \u201c. . . was literally The person . . . designated on the employer\u2019s records in accordance with the employee\u2019s election.\u2019 \u201d He then proceeded with an examination of the record to see whether there was any subsequent designation of beneficiary superseding what was written on the Acceptance card, and' concluded there was none and awarded the insurance to Betty Heyler.' He considered the certificate and its retention by Holton as equivocal acts insufficient, without additional evidence, to destroy the inference to be made from the Acceptance card.\nIt is at this point in his analysis of the evidence that we are constrained to differ from the learned judge. In addition to the Acceptance card of February 18, 1936, the record contains the insured\u2019s registry card showing entries by the employer on four dates beginning with March 1, 1936, to April 5, 1941. On that card the beneficiary is stated to be the insured\u2019s executors or administrators. That registry card is as much a part of the employer\u2019s records of Holton\u2019s insurance as the acceptance card. The policy required such records be kept. The registry card was produced by an employee of the. Sun: Shipbuilding Company who was custodian of and had \u201c. . . charge of the records and maintenance of the records of the group insurance plan, group hospitalization plan . . .\u201d of the company.\nThe evidential effect of this card makes it impossible for us to accept the inference made by the learned court from the Acceptance card. In considering group insurance transactions, it is held that the employer acts as the agent of the employees and not of the insurer: Bahas v. Equitable Life Assurance Society, 128 Pa. Superior Ct. 167, 173, 193 A. 344, aff\u2019d 331 Pa. 164, 200 A. 91; Boseman v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., 301 U. S. 196, 204, 57 Sup. Ct. 686; Duval v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 82 N. H. 543, 136 A. 400, 404; 1 Appleman (1941) Insurance Laws & Practice, p. 38. We must therefore assume that the employer-agent was authorized by its principal, Holton, from and after March 1, 1936, the date of the registry card, to consider the beneficiary as the employee\u2019s executor or administrator, thereby superseding the effect, whatever it might otherwise have been, of the acceptance card. If the employer-agent erred in recording the employee-principal\u2019s designation, the mistake might of course be corrected by proof; the burden would be on Betty Heyler, contending that the employer\u2019s records wrongly stated the fact. Not only is there no evidence of mistake by the agent, but there is evidence to support a finding that if the designation of \u201cexecutors or administrators,\u201d appearing on the registry card, had not been authorized before the employer made the record, it was ratified and adopted thereafter. This evidence is in the receipt and the retention for more than six years of the certificate issued by the Society to Holton. This certificate of March 1, 1936, shows, on its face, across the middle of the page in quite large letters, that the beneficiary is \u201cinsured\u2019s executors or administrators.\u201d The insured was a high school graduate. He retained this certificate until it was found among his effects after his death, for it provided what he should receive from the Society by way of substituted insurance on termination of his employment. It is not without significance that when his employment was terminated in 1940, he continued to retain this certificate and on his re-employment June 18,1940, signed a paper requesting the reinstatement of the insurance \u201cwith beneficiary designation therein set forth.\u201d Compare Burt v. Burt, 218 Pa. 198, 201, 67 A. 210; see Wigmore, Evidence, vol. 2, sections 245 and 260.\nWe also agree with the appellant that the Act of May 21, 1943, P. L; 471, 12 PS section 583, authorizing the court to allow counsel fees in specified interpleader cases, has no application to this case in which the proceeding was instituted before the effective date of the act and in which the insurance has not been paid into court.\nThe judgment is reversed and the record is remitted with instructions to find for the administratrix, and for such further proceedings, if any, as may be necessary to collect the amount due; costs to be paid out of the fund."}
