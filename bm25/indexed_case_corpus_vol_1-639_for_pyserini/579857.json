{"id": "579857", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nOn April 8, 1967, Harry Kleinhans died, leaving a will which, inter alia, divided his residuary estate equally into two trusts. His will provided that the income of trust A would be payable to testator\u2019s wife, Clara G. Kleinhans, for life. His wife was given a general testamentary power of appointment over the principal of trust A. The income of trust B was to be paid to testator\u2019s sister for life, with the remainder to two grandsons of testator.\nThe first and final account was filed June 17, 1968, in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Crawford County. It was confirmed on August 16, and distribution ordered. One-half of the residue, as directed by trust B, was distributed outright to testator\u2019s grandsons, testator\u2019s sister having died in the interval. The other half was distributed to testator\u2019s executor as trustee for the widow pursuant to the terms of trust A. Although certain taxes, both federal and state, were paid out of the residue before distribution, no tax was paid on the value of either the life estate or the remainder of trust A.\nClara Kleinhans died January 7,1972, leaving a will which was probated in Allegheny County. Testatrix exercised in favor of her estate the general testamentary power of appointment in trust A. By her will those assets would in turn be distributed to three heirs of testatrix, collaterals as to testator. No party in interest challenges that this testamentary transfer is subject to a 15% tax at the collateral rate.\nAn account was filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny County on November 21, 1972. Included was the principal of trust A, which was distributed to the estate at the termination of the widow\u2019s life tenancy. At audit the Commonwealth asserted its claim against the estate for the 15% tax.\nThe estate of Clara Kleinhans argued in the orphans\u2019 court that it was liable for only one-half of the 15% tax, because testator had directed that taxes be shared equally by the transferees of both trusts. In support of its argument, the estate relied upon the following provision in testator\u2019s will. \u201cFirst: I direct that all my just debts and funeral expenses be fully paid and satisfied as soon as conveniently may be after my decease and further direct that all Pennsylvania inheritance tax and Federal Estate tax be paid from my residuary Estate.\u201d Rejecting the estate\u2019s argument, the orphans\u2019 court held that the full 15% tax was to be paid out of the assets of trust A before distribution to testatrix\u2019s beneficiaries. The estate has appealed. We agree with the determination of the orphans\u2019 court and affirm its decree.\nThe question presented is whether the provision in testator\u2019s will directing that \u201call Pennsylvania inheritance tax ... be paid from my residuary Estate\u201d limits the tax liability of the remainder beneficiaries of trust A to one-half of the tax due on their inheritance. Appellant argues that this result is mandated by section 718 (c) of the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961, which provides: \u201cIn the absence of a contrary intent appearing in the will or other instrument of transfer and except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the ultimate liability for inheritance tax imposed by this act shall be upon each transferee.\u201d If appellant\u2019s interpretation of section 718(c) were to prevail, the Commonwealth would have to attempt to collect the other half of the tax from the remainder beneficiaries of trust B, who received their legacy prior to the termination of the widow\u2019s life tenancy. We conclude that section 718(c) does not justify such an unsound result.\nAppellant\u2019s argument is premised upon a misunderstanding of the effect and scope of section 718(c). That section merely affords a testator the privilege of shifting, in whole or in part, among his transferees their \u201cultimate liability for inheritance tax.\u201d Section 718(c) does not in any way abridge the right of the Commonwealth to collect from a transferee the full inheritance tax imposed upon the transfer.\nIn Zellefrow Estate, 450 Pa. 302, 299 A.2d 248 (1973), this Court dealt with a similar misconception of a companion provision, section 718(a). In that case, we were required to determine whether taxes due on specific bequests could be deducted from the residue before the tax on the residue was computed. The orphans\u2019 court held that such tax could be deducted on the theory that section 718(a) directed that the inheritance tax due on specific bequests \u201cshall be paid out of the residuary estate and charged in the same manner as a general administrative expense.\u201d We disagreed and stated: \u201cSuch an interpretation fails to recognize that Section 718(a) merely designates the source of payment of the tax as between the devisees of the specific gifts and those of the residue. . . . Section 718(a) does not deal with the imposition of the inheritance tax; that is provided for in Section 201.\u201d Id. at 305, 299 A.2d at 250 (footnote omitted). See Remmel Estate, 425 Pa. 325, 330 n.6, 228 A.2d 889, 892 n.6 (1967); Lengel Estate, 33 Pa. D. & C.2d 1 (O.C. Berks County 1963); cf. Frick\u2019s Estate, 277 Pa. 242, 121 A. 35 (1923), rov\u2019d on other grounds, 268 U.S. 473, 45 S. Ct. 603 (1925).\nBy a parity of reasoning the same conclusion holds for section 718(c); it also merely designates the source of payment of the tax. Section 201 of the Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961 provides: \u201cAn inheritance tax for the use of the Commonwealth is hereby imposed upon every transfer subject to tax under this act . . . .\u201d The mandate of that section is further fleshed out by section 211. \u201cAll transfers of property . . . by will . . . from a resident of this Commonwealth, are subject to tax under this act.\u201d This Court has often recognized that the inheritance tax is imposed upon the privilege of receiving decedent\u2019s property, or, alternatively, is \u201ca tax on the right of succession in the estate of the decedent.\u201d Remmel Estate, 425 Pa. 325, 328, 228 A.2d 889, 891-92 (1967); Belefski Estate, 413 Pa. 365, 369-70, 196 A.2d 850, 852 (1964) ; Hoffmann Estate, 399 Pa. 96, 100, 160 A.2d 237, 239 (1960); Tack\u2019s Estate, 325 Pa. 545, 191 A. 155 (1937); Shugars v. Chamberlain Amusement Enterprises, Inc., 284 Pa. 200, 205, 130 A. 426, 427 (1925); Orcutt\u2019s Appeal, 97 Pa. 179, 185 (1881).\nAlthough the testator may allocate the tax burden of his bequests among his beneficiaries, in doing so, he cannot thereby prejudice or diminish the Commonwealth\u2019s right to its total tax entitlement. The present situation is analogous to the one in which the source designated by a testator for the payment of taxes is insufficient to pay the taxes. In such a case, each transferee is liable for the tax on his legacy. See Bryant\u2019s Estate, 315 Pa. 151 155, 173 A. 190, 191 (1934); Folwell\u2019s Estate, 12 Pa. D. & C.2d 552, 553 (O.C. Montgomery County 1958); Mertz Estate, 5 Pa. D. & C.2d 262 (O.C. Lehigh County 1955); Thomson\u2019s Estate, 19 Pa. D. & C. 289, 292 (O.C. Philadelphia County 1933).\nFinally, the estate argues that because property subect to a power of appointment is taxed in the don- or\u2019s estate, and because the donee\u2019s estate is not the personal representative of testator (donor), it has no duty to pay the 15% inheritance tax. To answer this contention, it is necessary to turn to section 741, which in pertinent part provides: \u201cSubject to the provisions of section 718, every personal representative, or other fiduciary in charge of or in possession of any property, or instruments evidencing ownership thereof, the transfer of which is subject to a tax imposed by this act. . . shall deduct the tax from the property, if money, or shall collect the tax from the transferee.\u201d Section 741 affirmatively contradicts appellant\u2019s limiting construction. This section does not confine its scope to personal representatives or fiduciaries of a particular decedent or testator, rather it imposes a statutory duty on \u201cevery\u201d personal representative or fiduciary. Moreover, the fiduciary need merely be \u201cin charge of\u201d property. And the property is not restricted to property of a specified testator, but, more universally, is \u201cany property ... the transfer of which is subject to [inheritance] tax.\u201d\nSection 718(c) does not remove from the principal of trust A the obligation of satisfying the full 15% inheritance tax imposed upon its transfer to the beneficiaries chosen by testatrix. Appellant is bound by section 714 to deduct from the assets of trust A this inheritance tax.\nDecree affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nThe Pennsylvania inheritance tax is imposed at two tax rates. A 6% inheritance tax is levied upon transfers to persons generally considered \u201cdirect heirs.\u201d Act of December 29, 1967, P.L. 915, \u00a7 1, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-403 (Supp. 1973). The 6% rate applies to estates for all persons dying on or after Dec. 29, 1967, and to inter vivos transfers made by persons dying on or after that day regardless of the date of the transfer. Id. \u00a7 2. The 1967 amendment did not change the law in effect for persons dying before Dec. 29, 1967. See Act of June 15, 1961, P.L. 373, Art. IV, \u00a7 403, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-403 (1964) (2% rate on \u201cdirect heirs\u201d). Transfers of property to any other person not designated in section 403 are taxed at 15%. Id. \u00a7 404, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-404 (1964). These other persons are commonly referred to as collateral beneficiaries.\nThis Court\u2019s jurisdiction attaches by virtue of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(3), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(3) (Supp. 1973).\nAct of June 15, 1961, P.L. 373, Art. VII, \u00a7 718(c), 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-718 (c) (1964).\nSubsections (a) and (b) of \u00a7 718 provide: \u201c(a) Outright Devises and Bequests.\u2014In the absence of a contrary intent appearing in the will, the inheritance tax imposed by this act on the transfer of property which passes by will absolutely and in fee, and which is not part of the residuary estate, shaU be paid out of the residuary estate and charged in the same manner as a general administration expense. Such payment shall be made by the personal representative and, if not so paid, shall be made by the transferee of the residuary estate. (b) Transfer for Limited Period. In the absence of a contrary intent appearing in the will or other instrument of transfer, the inheritance tax imposed by this act, in the case of a transfer of any estate income or interest for a term of years, for life, or for other limited period, shall be paid out of the principal of the property by which the estate, income or interest is supported. Such payment shall be made by the personal representative and, if not so paid, shall be made by the trustee, if any, and, if not so paid, shall be made by the transferee of such principal.\u201d Act of June 15, 1961, P.L. 373, Art. VII, \u00a7 718(a), (b), 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-718(a), (b) (1964).\nA power of appointment is exempt from taxation in the estate of the donee, Act of June 15, 1961, P.L. 373, Art.

IV, \u00a7 408, 72 P.S. \u00a7 2485-408 (1964).\nThe Commonwealth in its appraisement of testator\u2019s estate, filed on October 18, 1967, put all parties in interest on notice of its statutory entitlement to inheritance tax by inserting the following. \u201cIn the event that any future interest in this estate is transferred in possession or enjoyment to collateral heirs of the decedent after the expiration of any estate for life or for years, the Commonwealth hereby expressly reserves the right to appraise and assess transfer inheritance taxes at the lawful collateral rate on any such future interest\u201d A statutory procedure exists whereby \u201cany party in interest may elect... to have the value of a future interest determined as of the date of decedent\u2019s death and to pay the tax assessed thereon.\u201d Act of June 15, 1961, P.L. 373, Art.

The thrust of the section is that the burden of the inheritance tax is upon the transferee. \u201cSubject to the provisions of section 718, every personal representative, or other fiduciary in charge of or in possession of any property, or instruments evidencing ownership thereof, the transfer of which is subject to a tax imposed by this act other than tax on a future interest not yet delinquent, shall deduct the tax from the property, if money, or shall collect the tax from the transferee. Any delivery of property or instruments by such fiduciary to a transferee, except in accordance with a decree of distribution of the court, shall not relieve him of personal liability for a tax imposed by this act. No personal representative or other fiduciary in charge of or in possession of any property subject to this act shall be compelled to pay or deliver it to the transferee except upon payment to him of the tax duo thereon other than tax on a future interest not yet delinquent. If such transferee neglects or refuses to pay the tax, the personal representative or other fiduciary may sell the property subject to the tax, or so much thereof as is necessary, under direction of the court. All money retained by the personal representative or other fiduciary, or paid to him on account of the taxes imposed by this act, shall be remitted by him before the tax becomes delinquent or, if received thereafter, shall be remitted by him promptly upon its receipt\u201d Id. (footnote omitted).\nAppellant also contends that in section 741 the phrase \u201c[s']ubject to the provisions of section 718\u201d incorporates the language of section 718(c) \u201c[i]n the absence of a contrary intent appearing in the will.\u201d Even if this were the proper interpretation of section 741, our holding that section 718(c) cannot be read to limit the Commonwealth\u2019s right to collect taxes nullifies appellant\u2019s argument.\nNothing in our disposition prevents appellant from seeking contribution from the remaindermen of trust B. The orphans\u2019 court adjudication was properly without prejudice to the assertion of this claim."}
