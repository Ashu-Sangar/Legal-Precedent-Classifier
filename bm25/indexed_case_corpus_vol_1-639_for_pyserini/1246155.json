{"id": "1246155", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Belt,\nThis involves two actions in trespass, arising out of the same accident, which were consolidated for trial before a judge and jury. One suit was brought by the operator of a tractor-trailer for personal injuries sustained by him, and the other by its owner for damages to the vehicle. In the latter action, defendants joined the operator as an additional defendant. Verdicts were rendered in favor of both plaintiffs. A third verdict was also rendered in favor of the operator as the additional defendant in the owner\u2019s case. Defendants filed motions for judgment n.o.v. and new trial, which were dismissed by the Court en banc. Prom the judgments entered on the verdicts, defendants now appeal.\nTaking the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, and resolving all conflicts in the evidence in their favor, as we must where a defendant is seeking judgment non obstante veredicto, the facts may be thus summarized:\nPlaintiff Brusis was operating on November 4, 1949 at about 12:30 o\u2019clock A.M. a tractor-trailer owned by plaintiff States in an easterly direction on Street Hoad, Bucks County, Pa. The vehicle at its widest point was 7% feet wide and 42 to 45 feet long over all. The gross weight of the loaded vehicle was 30,500 pounds.\nStreet Road is a macadam paved highway eighteen feet in width bounded on each side by dirt shoulders or berms. Brusis was traveling at a speed of about twenty-five miles an hour as he approached a curve bearing to his left. When one hundred to one hundred fifty feet from the curve, he saw an automobile without lights parked at the curve partly on the paved portion of the highway and partly on the south shoulder. Brusis swung the tractor-trailer to the left and in passing the car, drove off the road on to the berm on the north or left side and immediately felt the left front wheel of the tractor sink in the shoulder, which he said was soft mud. The left front wheel started to sway and swing. Brusis, trying to get off the berm, kept his foot on the gas for a distance of approximately 50 feet when he crashed into a utility pole on the berm, with the result that the tractor-trailer turned over and Brusis was injured. The defendants, in order to install a ten inch gas pipe, had been excavating and back-filling a trench along the north berm of Street Road for a distance of about 8 miles. The trench was 18 inches wide and the southern edge was 15 inches to 2 feet north of the paved portion of the highway. The trench had been properly filled in by defendants 30 days prior to the accident. Plaintiff\u2019s witness, who was in charge of this work for the Commonwealth, testified that defendant had placed (a) \u201cRoad under Construction\u201d signs along the entire route, and (b) signs along this 8 mile highway every 200 feet with the words \u201cSoft Shoulders\u201d printed thereon, so that they could be easily seen by vehicles approaching on the right side of the road where the pipe was laid. This evidence must be disregarded because the plaintiff himself said he saAV no signs. The paved portion of Street Road has a Avhite center line which divides the highAvay for eastbound and Avestbound traffic and is, we repeat, 18 feet in Avidth. Even if the parked car had not been parked partly on the berm, it Avould have left ample space for a carefully driven tractor-trailer to pass by on the other side of the macadam paved highway.\n\u201c. . . \u2018The mere happening of an accident is no evidence of negligence. . . . Plaintiff has the two-fold bui den of proving that the defendant was negligent and that his negligence was the proximate cause of the accident: Lanni v. P. R. R. Co., 371 Pa. 106, 109, 88 A. 2d 887.\nIt had rained all day. Brusis was an experienced driver. There was nothing to prevent him from seeing the parked automobile as soon as it came within range of his lights. He admits he saw it when he was a 100 to 150 feet away from it, and at that time he was driving at a speed of 25 miles an hour. He could easily have stopped his car, or he could have slowed down, or he could have continued at 25 miles an hour and in either ease easily have driven past the parked car, on the paved highway. He did none of these. He had a minimum of 11 feet of paved highway on which he could with reasonable care have easily driven his tractor-trailer. lie either carelessly or deliberately drove off the paved highway on to the soft shoulder or berm which he knew was wet from an all day rain.\nEven if we assume that some signs, warning of soft shoulders, were necessary in the exercise of due care and that none were erected at the place of the accident so as to be visible to a driver traveling in a westerly direction, plaintiffs failed to prove that defendants owed and breached any duty as to them; Dahlstrom v. Shrum, 368 Pa. 423, 84 A. 2d 289; Restatement, Torts, \u00a7281; Rockey v. Ernest, 367 Pa. 538, 80 A. 2d 783.\nIn Dahlstrom v. Shrum, 368 Pa., supra, the plaintiff was injured when an automobile operated by defendant struck and killed a man on a highway, whose body was hurled through the air striking and injuring plaintiff, who was lawfully on the highway behind a bus from which she had alighted. This Court sustained a nonsuit, holding that defendant owed a duty solely to those whom a reasonable man might foresee might be injured by driving an automobile 35 miles per hour past a bus which was standing on the opposite side of the road. The Court said (page 425) : \u201c. . . Negligence is defined as the absence of care under the circumstances: Beck v. Stanley Company of America, 355 Pa. 608, 50 A. 2d 306; Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., 248 N. Y. 339, 162 N. E. 99. The test of negligence is whether the wrongdoer could have anticipated and foreseen the likelihood of harm to the injured person, resulting from his act: Scurfield v. Federal Laboratories, Inc., 335 Pa. 145, 6 A. 2d 559. In Palsgraf v. Long Island R. Co., supra, it was stated by Caedozo, C. J. (later Justice, United States Supreme Court): \u2018. . . the orbit of the danger as disclosed to the eye of reasonable vigilance would be the orbit of the duty.\u2019 \u201d\nIn Restatement, Torts, \u00a7281, the law is thus stated (page 735) : \u201cComment on Clause (b) : c. Risk to class of which plaintiff is member. If the actor\u2019s conduct creates a recognizable risk of harm only to a particular class of persons, the fact that it causes harm to a person of a different class, to whom the actor could not reasonably have anticipated injury, does not render the actor liable to the persons so injured.\u201d\n\u201c. . . It is well settled that conduct is negligent only if the harmful consequences thereof could reasonably have been foreseen and prevented: Leoni v. Reinhard, 327 Pa. 391, 194 A. 490; Franzen v. Goodman, 325 Pa. 518, 190 A. 888; White v. Roydhouse, 211 Pa. 13, 60 A. 316; Gaupin v. Murphy, 295 Pa. 214, 145 A. 123.\u201d: Rockey v. Ernest, 367 Pa. 538, 541, 80 A. 2d 783.\nIn Tua v. Brentwood Motor Coach Co. et al., 371 Pa. 570, 92 A. 2d 209, the Court said (page 575) : \u201c. . . But it is a cardinal rule of law that \u2018want of ordinary care consists in failure to anticipate what is reasonably probable \u2014 not what is remotely possible\u2019: Camp v. Allegheny County, 263 Pa. 276, 282, 106 A. 314 . . .\u201d\nDefendant had no duty to anticipate the remote possibility of an eastbound motorist driving off the paved highway on the wrong side of the highway especially at a curve.\nIn the view we take of the case, it is unnecessary to decide whether Brusis was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law by intentionally or carelessly and unnecessarily driving his heavy tractor-trailer in rainy weather off a paved highway and on a soft shoulder, and thereafter keeping his foot on the gas for 50 feet until he ran into the pole.\nThe judgments are reversed and are here entered for the defendants non obstante veredicto."}
