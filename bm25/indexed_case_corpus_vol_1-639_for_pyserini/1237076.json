{"id": "1237076", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThe appellant pleaded not guilty to an indictment charging him with the murder of his common law wife. At all times until sentence, he was represented by counsel privately employed by his sister. During the selection of the jury at trial, he changed his plea to guilty and the trial judge proceeded to hear testimony for the purpose of determining the degree of the crime. Finding the defendant guilty of murder in the second degree, the court sentenced him to not less than nine nor more than eighteen years in the penitentiary. After he had served approximately two years of the sentence, the defendant, acting in propria persona, petitioned the trial court for a writ of error coram nobis seeking thereby to withdraw his plea of guilty on the ground that he had acted in the premises under a misunderstanding of the nature and consequences of the plea. Specifically, he alleged that his counsel had deceived him in regard to the effect of the plea of guilty and that the hearing judge had overreached him by acting affirmatively on the plea after the defendant had testified in substantial denial of his guilt of the crime charged. Following a hearing on the petition, the court refused the writ and dismissed the petition. From that order, the defendant took this appeal in forma pauperis upon our allowance. He has been ably represented in this court by appointed counsel who has served gratuitously and who has earnestly argued the petitioner\u2019s contentions at length both orally and by brief.\nIt is open to serious doubt whether a writ of coram nobis properly lies in circumstances such as the petitioner avers. The situations in which such a writ is the appropriate legal instrument for the relief sought are extremely limited: see Commonwealth v. Harris, 351 Pa. 325, 327-329, 41 A. 2d 688; also Commonwealth v. Brewer, 170 Pa. Superior Ct. 251, 252, 85 A. 2d 618. As a corollary, writs of coram nobis have been rarely applied for in this State and, still more rarely, have they been granted. In the Harris case, supra, Chief Justice Maxey pointed out (p. 329) that \u201cThe writ of coram nobis has seldom been invoked in Pennsylvania [see instances in footnote], and we believe that this is the first time [1945] a question involving the issuance of this writ has been before this court in a criminal case.\u201d There is nothing in the petitioner\u2019s ease that was not a matter of record or knmvn to him at the time judgment of sentence was imposed: cf. Commonwealth v. Harris and Commonwealth v. Brewer, supra. However, we do not predicate anything on the possible inapplicability of the procedure now resorted to by the petitioner. If his case were meritorious, we would readily fit the proper remedy to the facts. But, we fail to find any validity in his contentions.\nAt the hearing on the petition for the writ, the defendant testified that his change of plea to guilty was made upon the assurance of his counsel \u201cthat there could be an acquittal\u201d by the court and that, if the result reached by the court was not satisfactory to him, he could have \u201ca regular jury trial\u201d. On the other hand, petitioner\u2019s trial counsel, whom the court found to be a reputable member of the bar of the county, testified that the effect of the plea of guilty was thoroughly explained to the defendant in the presence of his sister and associate counsel during a recess of the trial (the jury was being selected at the time) and that the defendant fully understood the import of the plea. When counsel was asked on cross-examination whether \u201c. . , there was any discussion between you and the defendant with reference to the fact that if he wasn\u2019t satisfied, that he could have a jury trial if he wasn\u2019t satisfied with the result before the Court\u201d, he unequivocally answered, \u2014 \u201cNo, that is not true. I think no attorney at the Bar would tell any defendant that.\u201d On the basis of the credible testimony adduced at the hearing on the petition, the court below aptly characterized the petitioner\u2019s contention, relative to the alleged inducement of his counsel to enter a plea of guilty, as being \u201cso ridiculous as to be absurd\u201d. It would require more than credulity to accredit that counsel told his client anything so obviously fallacious and readily susceptible of being so revealed. Upon resumption of the trial, following the recess, the defendant formally withdrew his plea of not guilty, was re-arraigned and thereupon pleaded guilty. The court, commanding the defendant to stand up, addressed him as follows: \u201cYou are pleading guilty generally to this indictment. Is that what you want?\u201d The defendant answered \u201cYes\u201d. The court then took testimony, including the defendant\u2019s, to determine the degree of the crime.\nThe contention that the defendant testified in virtual repudiation of his plea of guilty and that the court should therefore have vacated the plea and put him to trial before a jury upon a plea of not guilty is equally untenable. It is true that the defendant denied a specific intent to take the deceased\u2019s life, but it is also true that he not only did not deny, but actually admitted, that the lethal weapon (a knife) was clasped in his hand when it entered the body of the deceased with mortal effect. His denial .of guilt was but his own interpretation of the legal consequences of his undisputed conduct which, naturally, he was anxious to have appear to the hearing judge in the light most favorable to him. According., to the defendant\u2019s, version of the fatal occurrence, \u2014 during a'wrangle'with his wife she \u201c. . . went, over .and grabbed something [i.e., the knife] off the mantle'and. she came after me . . . and I reached for the knife, I grabbed for it, and finally I got it off her. I know I had the knife and I think I dropped it in my pocket and she ran down the hall and was yelling , . . .\u201d A young daughter of the deceased who was in the room at the time of the occurrence testified that the knife was never in her mother\u2019s hands throughout the altercation and further that the defendant \u201c. . . stabbed her [mother] and threw her against the door and tried to hit her, stab her again.\u201d The defendant also told a nearby squire shortly after the affray that he had stabbed his wife. When interrogated in court, he did not deny having had so declared but merely equivocated, saying, \u2014 \u201cI was excited. I don\u2019t remember what I told him.\u201d\nThe court was under no legal duty to accept as absolute verity the defendant\u2019s recital of the circumstances attending the homicide. Nor could the court have justifiably done so in the light of all of the evidence in the case. That the testimony made out a case of murder is not open to question. The facts warranted a finding that the defendant used the deadly weapon on a vital part of the deceased\u2019s body with malice aforethought. Indeed, as the court below has stated, \u2014 \u201cFrom this testimony the degree of guilt might well have been that of murder of the first degree.\u201d Inasmuch as a plea of guilty generally to an indictment for murder automatically constitutes the crime murder in the second degree, the burden is on the Commonwealth, if it desires to raise the degree to first, to produce the necessary testimony: Commonwealth, v. Samuel Jones, 355 Pa. 522, 525, 50 A. 2d 317. In the present instance the court was of the opinion that the Commonwealth had failed to show that the murder was deliberate and premeditated and, hence, found the defendant guilty of murder in the second degree.\nThe appellant\u2019s remaining contention that the trial judge improperly restricted his counsel\u2019s cross-examination of a Commonwealth\u2019s witness raises alleged trial error which is reviewable on appeal and not on a writ of coram nobis. None the less, we have carefully examined the record and find no abuse of discretion by the trial judge in bringing the cross-examination of the witness to a conclusion when he did. The cross-examination, which had already considerably exceeded the direct examination of the witness, had become repetitive. The defendant\u2019s rights were fully respected. All told, twenty witnesses were heard, some at length, for a total of a hundred and twenty-one pages of testimony as disclosed by the transcript.\nOrder affirmed."}
