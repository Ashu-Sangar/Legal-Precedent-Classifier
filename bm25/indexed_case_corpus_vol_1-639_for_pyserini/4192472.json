{"id": "4192472", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 25th day of March, 2009, this matter is CONSOLIDATED with the matter filed at 26 MM 2009. See Pa.R.A.P. 513 and 102.\nThe consolidated matter is REMANDED to the Court of Judicial Discipline for the limited purpose of that court considering Petitioner\u2019s claims in the nature of after-discovered evidence, arising from the recent revelations of corruption in Luzerne County. The Court of Judicial Discipline is to determine whether the new evidence requires a further hearing and/or whether it affects the existing determination of the Court of Judicial Discipline to remove Petitioner from judicial office.\nFurthermore, the December 9, 2008 order of the Court of Judicial Discipline is STAYED pending remand and a final determination of this matter, and the Secretary of the Commonwealth is directed to refrain from placing Petitioner\u2019s judicial seat on the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County on the May 2009 primary ballot. This stay is entered solely for the purpose of ensuring that Petitioner\u2019s seat on the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County is not placed on the ballot until final resolution of this judicial disciplinary matter, and is not to be construed as this Court taking any position on the merits of Petitioner\u2019s appeal or her after-discovered evidence claim.\nJurisdiction is relinquished.\nJustice McCAFFERY dissents."}
