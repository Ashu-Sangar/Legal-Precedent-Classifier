{"id": "478072", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThe First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Lancaster was the holder of a mortgage on a parcel of realty in the city of Lancaster. Taxes became delinquent, and, pursuant to the Real Estate Tax Sale Law, the property was sold at a properly advertised and conducted public judicial sale on October 28, 1971. First Federal did not send a representative to the sale. Appellant, Tom Swift, was the successful bidder at the duly-authorized sale and purchased the premises, as statutorily directed, \u201cfree and clear of all tax and municipal claims, mortgages, liens, charges and estates of whatsoever kind, except ground rents, separately taxed.\u201d\nOn January 7, 1972, First Federal instituted an equitable proceeding to set aside the judicial tax sale. The court, after a hearing, granted the requested relief. First Federal Savings & Loan Association v. Swift, 63 Lancaster L. Rev. 567 (Pa. C.P. 1973). This appeal followed. We reverse.\nFirst Federal sought equitable relief on the basis of an alleged mistake of faet. Several weeks prior to the October 23 public sale, Robert F. Keener, an employee of the Lancaster Redevelopment Authority, went to the tax claim bureau. Evidently, there had been some discussion between the Authority and First Federal concerning the purchase of the property in question. At the tax bureau, Keener \u201casked for the list of the tax sale that was coming up,\u201d without specifying the list for any particular date. The clerk handed Keener the sale list for October 30, 1971. Keener examined the list and discovered that this particular property was not there listed for sale.\nKeener then gratuitously informed First Federal that the realty would not be sold on October 23. Keener was neither agent nor employee of either the tax claim bureau or First Federal. Without investigating further, First Federal relied on Keener\u2019s information and advised its attorney not to appear at the October 23 sale. First Federal concedes it had earlier received official notice of the sale.\nThe chancellor correctly observed that there is no basis at law for setting aside the sale. Proper notice was given, and the sale was held at the court\u2019s direction in conformity with the statutory requirements. The court therefore stated that \u201c[tjhere is no reason to disturb the sale unless equitable principles are involved which require the granting of relief to the plaintiff.\u201d It did, however, believe that equity empowered the court to grant relief despite First Federal\u2019s unilateral mistake. The chancellor set aside the sale. In the circumstances of this case, the grant of equitable relief was error.\nEven recognizing that a court of equity has broad powers, \u201c[i]t is a mistake to suppose, that a court of equity is amenable to no law, either common or statute, and assumes the rule of an arbitrary legislator in every particular case.\u201d Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries on the Law 732 (B. Gavit ed. 1941). When the rights of a party are clearly established by defined principles of law, equity should not change or unsettle those rights. Equity follows the law. Hedges v. Dixon County, 150 U.S. 182, 14 S. Ct. 71 (1893); Bauer v. P.A. Cutri Co., 434 Pa. 305, 253 A.2d 252 (1969); Scott v. Waynesburg Brewing Co., 256 Pa. 158, 100 A. 591 (1917); Abrahams v. Wilson, 134 Pa. Superior Ct. 297, 3 A.2d 1016 (1939); see 2 J. Pomeroy, A Treatise on Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7 425 (5th ed. S. Symons 1941).\nHere, the rights of the parties are specifically established by the Real Estate Tax Sale Law. The statute is the sole authority governing the sale of this land for delinquent taxes. See Richards v. Schuylkill County, 20 Pa. D. & C. 2d 539 (C.P. Schuylkill County 1959), aff\u2019d per curiam, 399 Pa. 552, 161 A.2d 26 (1960).\nThe statute provides several protections for a mortgagee. Notice must be given, and here it was. A mortgagee, as a \u201clien creditor of the owner,\u201d may stay the sale by entering into an agreement with the tax bureau for the payment of back taxes. First Federal negotiated no such agreement. Prior to sale, \u201cany lien creditor\u201d may redeem the property. First Federal did not. Before a property may be sold at judicial sale, it must first be offered at a \u201ctax upset sale,\u201d a sale which, unlike a judicial tax sale, does not discharge mortgages. Here, in accordance with the statute, the upset sale was publically advertised for three consecutive weeks in newspapers and by posting on the property. On the advertised date, the real estate was offered for sale but not then purchased. The \u201cregularity or legality of the proceedings of the [tax] bureau in respect to such [upset] sale\u201d may be challenged. No such challenge was made. The judicial sale was then properly advertised and, by court order, the realty was offered for public sale on October 23. First Federal does not challenge the legality or regularity of this sale. Finally, a mortgagee may bid for and purchase premises on which it holds a mortgage. Despite actual notice, First Federal did not appear or bid at the judicial sale. The record reveals that First Federal failed to avail itself of any of the ample opportunities to protect its interest.\nOn the other hand, after a judicial tax sale the purchaser is statutorily protected. A judicial sale discharges all mortgages and the purchaser takes title \u201cfree and clear of all tax and municipal claims, mortgages, liens, charges and estates of whatsoever kind, except ground rents, separately taxed.\u201d Moreover, the Real Estate Tax Sale Law specifically provides that \u201c[t]here shall be no redemption of any property after the sale thereof.\u201d\nThe rights of all parties to a tax sale are defined and governed by statute. \u201c[Wjhenever there is a direct rule of law governing the case in all its circumstances, the [equity] court is as much bound by it as would be a court of law . . . .\u201d Albright v. Albright, 228 Pa. 552, 77 A. 896 (1910); see 2 J. Pomeroy, supra, \u00a7125 at 189-90. Where, as here, the parties\u2019 rights are regulated and fixed by a comprehensive scheme of legislation, the maxim \u201cequity follows the law\u201d is entitled to the greatest deference. See, e.g., Bauer, supra; Albright, supra; Cloeter v. Superior Court, 86 Ariz. 400, 347 P.2d 33 (1959); Milgram v. Jiffy Equipment Co., 362 Mo. 1194, 247 S.W.2d 668 (1952); In re Adoption of McCauley, 177 Neb. 759, 131 N.W.2d 174 (1964); cf. 1 Pa. S. \u00a7 1501 (Special Pamphlet 1973).\nMoreover, the \u201cmistake of fact\u201d alleged by First Federal is precisely the sort of mistake which cannot provide a basis for equitable relief. First Federal elected to rely on information volunteered by a person without authority to speak for either the court which ordered the sale or the tax bureau which administered it. It did so at its own risk. The sale had been fully and properly advertised in accordance with the statute. Notice of the judicial sale had also been sent to and received by First Federal, and the realty was correctly listed for sale for October 23. Although the means for determining the accuracy of Keener\u2019s gratuitous communication were readily at hand, First Federal admits that it took no steps to confirm this information with the proper authorities. First Federal may not now successfully contend that its own inattentiveness and failure to utilize its statutory protections entitles it to a decree setting aside a lawful sale.\n\u201c[CJourts of equity will not relieve a party from the consequences of an error due to his own ignorance or carelessness when there were available means which would have enabled him to avoid the mistake if reasonable care had been exercised.\u201d Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corp. v. Crouse, 151 Pa. Superior Ct. 259, 263, 30 A.2d 330, 332 (1943). See Stone v. C.I.T. Corp., 122 Pa. Superior Ct. 71, 184 A. 674 (1936); Lessa v. Staler, 75 Pa. Superior Ct. 468 (1921); Felin v. Futcher, 51 Pa. Superior Ct. 233 (1912); 3 J. Pomeroy, supra, \u00a7 856b. Here, First Federal chose to rely on Keener\u2019s unverified information rather than avail itself of any of the several statutory procedures designed for its benefit.\nIn these circumstances, First Federal is not entitled to relief, nor may appellant be deprived of the property he lawfully purchased.\nDecree reversed. Costs on appellee.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nAct of July 7, 1947, P.L. 1368, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5860.101-.803 (1968 & Supp. 1973).\nId. art. VI, \u00a7 612, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.612 (Supp. 1973).\nSwift, believing tbat appellate jurisdiction was vested in the Commonwealth Court by the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. IV, \u00a7 402(4), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.402(4) (Supp. 1973), filed a timely appeal in that court. Jurisdiction is properly in this Court pursuant to \u00a7 202(4) of the Act, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(4) (Supp. 1973), and the Commonwealth Court transferred the case. Id. art. V, \u00a7 503(b), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.503(b) (Supp. 1973). An appeal so transferred is treated as if timely filed in this Court. Id.\nThe chancellor also was concerned about the purchase price Swift paid for the projierty. At the hearing, he stated: \u201cSee, the Court has no benefit of any information like the value of the property or anything else. Now, this may be worth [the purchase price]. If it\u2019s worth [the purchase price], then, this is a good sale. If this was a steal, the Court is going to upset the sale, and make it exempt.\u201d In his opinion, the chancellor translated this concern into an erroneous finding of \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d and a legal conclusion that \u201c[t]he defendant would receive an unconscionable advantage if the sale were not set aside.\u201d First Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass\u2019n v. Swift, 63 Lancaster L. Rev. 567, 570 (Pa. C.P. 1973).\nThe Real Estate Tax Sale Law provides, however, that at a judicial sale the property is to be sold \u201cto the highest bidder,\u201d unless the court sets a minimum price not bid. Act of July 7, 1947, P.L. 1368, art. VI, \u00a7 612, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.612 (Supp. 1973). No minimum bid was here set by the court. It is presumed that the price received at a duly-advertised public sale is the highest and best obtainable. Plummer v. Wilson, 322 Pa. 118, 185 A. 311 (1936); Tax Claim Bureau v. Wheatcroft, 2 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 408, 278 A.2d 172 (1971). A statutorily satisfactory price having been obtained at public sale, the record furnishes no basis for the chancellor\u2019s finding of \u201cunjust enrichment.\u201d\nReal Estate Tax Sale Raw, Act of July 7, 1947, P.R. 1368, art.
