{"id": "1885944", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nEffie E. Sherwood died February 15, 1960. Her will was executed on December 9, 1954. The bequest which we are asked to interpret, is:\n\u201cI give, devise and bequeath unto my grandson, George W. Sherwood, Jr., one twenty-fourth of my estate and to Helen S. Sherwood, widow of George W. Sherwood, if she remains at the time of my death his widow one twenty-fourth share of my estate. If Helen S. Sherwood shall have remarried by the time of my death, then and in that case, I give the said one twenty-fourth share unto my remaining five children to be divided among them equally.\u201d\nWhen Mrs. Sherwood made her will, her son, George W. Sherwood, was deceased and was survived by his widow, Helen S. Sherwood, the appellant herein, and by his son, George W. Sherwood, Jr. After the execution of the will Helen S. Sherwood remarried, but eight months later was divorced.\nAt the audit of the account of testatrix\u2019s executor, Helen S. Sherwood claimed one twenty-fourth of the estate under the aforesaid testamentary bequest. She contended that despite the fact that she had \u201cremarried\u201d after the execution of the will and prior to testatrix\u2019s death, she was nevertheless unmarried and therefore was the \u201cwidow\u201d of George W. Sherwood at the time of testatrix\u2019s death. From the Decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, which dismissed her claim, she took this appeal.\nAppellant contends that in the above quoted two sentences of the will testatrix created only one condition precedent\u2014that appellant should \u201cremain at the time of [testatrix\u2019s] death [George\u2019s] widow.\u201d The fact that appellant was divorced before testatrix\u2019s death, cannot be tortured into meaning that she \u201cremained George\u2019s widow at the time of [testatrix\u2019s] death,\u201d nor can it obliterate testatrix\u2019s clearly expressed language and intent that if appellant \u201cshall have remarried by the 'time of my . death, then in that case, I give the said one twenty-fourth share unto my remaining five children . . . .\u201d Appellant\u2019s contentions are utterly devoid of merit.\nDecree affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nHelen S. Sherwood, the widow of George W. Sherwood, married Joseph M. Bannon. She was divorced from him in Wyoming County, Pa. The record in the divorce action shows that she did not pursue the Act of May 25, 1939, P. L. 192, as amended, 23 P.S. \u00a798, in order to \u201cresume her maiden name or her prior name\u201d; nor does the appearance docket show any other proceeding for change of name."}
