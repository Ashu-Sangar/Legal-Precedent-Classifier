{"id": "197187", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 31st day of March, 2003, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is hereby GRANTED, limited to the following issues:\nWhether the present matter presents the need and opportunity for the Supreme Court to clarify the requirement that an exclusion in an insurance policy must be \u201cconspicuously displayed?\u201d Standard Venetian Blind Co. v. American Empire Insurance Co., 503 Pa. 300, 469 A.2d 563, 567 (1983).\nWhether the Superior Court could enter summary judgment in Erie\u2019s favor when the uncontradicted testimony in the record indicated that Petitioner requested a policy to cover gasoline leaks at his gas station and was sold the policy in question by Erie\u2019s agent who said it provided the desired coverage?\nWhether Petitioner was penalized by the split among the panels in the Superior Court on the manner in determining whether a substance constitutes a \u201cpollutant.\u201d Clearly, if the panel in Mt. Lebanon v. Reliance Insurance Company, 2001 Pa.Super. 177, 778 A.2d 1228 (2001) had h\u00e9ard this appeal, it would have ruled that gasoline, just like natural gas, was not unambiguously a \u201cpollutant\u201d when viewed under Federal and Pennsylvania environmental legislation."}
