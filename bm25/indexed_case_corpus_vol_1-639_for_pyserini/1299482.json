{"id": "1299482", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nMay foreign attachment issue in Pennsylvania against a foreign corporation upon a cause of action arising out of a tort which occurred outside Pennsylvania?\nOn June 30, 1959, Harold Alpers (Alpers), a Pennsylvania resident, was a passenger in a motor vehicle in New Jersey which became involved in an accident with another motor vehicle owned and controlled by the New Jersey Bell Telephone Company (New Jersey Bell), a foreign corporation. Alpers allegedly sustained personal injuries in that accident.\nA year later, Alpers caused a writ of foreign attachment to be issued in the Court of Common Pleas No. 5 of Philadelphia County against New Jersey Bell as defendant and the Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania Bell) as garnishee. At the same time Alpers filed a complaint and New Jersey Bell and Pennsylvania Bell moved to strike off the complaint and for judgment of non pros. The court below, taking the position that foreign attachment would not lie for a tort which occurred outside Pennsylvania, granted the motion for judgment of non pros. Prom that action this appeal was taken.\nIn considering this appeal, certain facts, as alleged, may be taken as established: (1) New Jersey Bell, the alleged tortfeasor, is a foreign corporation; (2) Pennsylvania Bell, a domestic corporation and garnishee, when the writ was issued had in its possession certain property of New Jersey Bell; (3) the cause of action is a tort which occurred in New Jersey.\nIn Commonwealth to use v. A. B. Baxter and Company, Inc., 235 Pa. 179, 190, 191, 84 A. 136, we said: \u201cThe action of foreign attachment in Pennsylvania is based upon one of the customs of London:' Laws and Privileges of London, 113-140; Brandon on Foreign Attachment. The purpose of the custom was to compel the appearance of the defendant and this is also true in our state: [citing cases]. Both by the custom and by our statutes the writ lay against a foreign corporation :\u201d. In Falk & Company v. South Texas Cotton Oil Company, 368 Pa. 199, 205, 82 A. 2d 27, we said in respect to an action begun by a writ of foreign attachment: \u201cTwo fundamental facts must coexist: (1) The defendant must be a non-resident or a foreign corporation and (2) The defendant must have real or personal property within this Commonwealth when the writ of foreign attachment was served on garnishee.\u201d. See also: Fairchild Engine & Airplane Corporation v. Bellanca Corporation, 391 Pa. 177, 180, 137 A. 2d 248. Alpers, relying on Pa. R. C. P. Rule 1252, urges that these cases set forth all the jurisdictional facts presently necessary to the issuance of foreign attachment. New Jersey Bell and Pennsylvania Bell contend that, if the cause of action for which the attachment is sought is a tort committed outside Pennsylvania, foreign attachment will not lie.\nForeign attachment \u2014 an extraordinary remedy \u2014 is a creature of - statute and the statutory provisions which are subject to strict construction, furnish the sole source for the authority of a court to issue the writ. See: Kohl v. Lyons, 125 Pa. Superior Ct. 347, 349, 350, 189 A. 498.\nThe Act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 568, \u00a744, 12 PS \u00a72891 provided that foreign attachment could issue against the real or personal estate \u201cof any person not residing within this commonwealth, and not being within the county in which such writ shall issue, at the time of the issuing thereof.\u201d The Act of May 15, 1874, P. L. 183, \u00a71, permitted foreign attachment to issue \u201cin all cases wherein any person who, being a resident of this commonwealth, shall have removed therefrom, after having become liable in an action ex delicto.\u201d The Act of March 30, 1905, P. L. 76, \u00a71, extended the scope of foreign attachment and permitted its issuance \u201cin all actions ex contractu and in actions ex delicto for a tort committed within this Oommonwealth.\u201d Until 1905, our courts consistently declared that foreign attachment would not lie in tort actions.\nIn 1911, the legislature extended the provisions of the statute regulating foreign attachment to foreign corporations and, in 1931, the Act of 1836, supra, was amended so that foreign attachment might be issued against the real or personal property of a non-resident of the state temporarily in the state at the time of issuap.ce of the writ and in certain cases of residents of the state who have removed therefrom.\nUntil the promulgation of Rule 1252 both our statutes and case law after 1905 limited foreign attachment in actions ex delicto to torts which occurred within Pennsylvania. Alpers urges that Rule 1252 has changed the law in this respect and that foreign attachment will now lie for torts which occurred outside Pennsylvania. Rule 1252, in pertinent part, provides: \u201cA foreign attachment may be issued to attach property of a defendant not exempt from execution upon any cause of action at law or in equity in which the relief sought includes a judgment or decree for the payment of money . . .\u201d Rule 1461(4} suspends certain Acts of Assembly under which foreign attachment was previously issued.\nIn view of the clear restriction of the writ, of foreign attachment in actions ex delicto to torts committed within the Commonwealth both by statutory and ease law prior to the promulgation of Rule 1252, it was certainly not intended by this Court that Rule 1252 change or alter in any manner a rule of law1 not only so firmly established but also so salutary in effect. Alpers\u2019 interpretation of-Rule 1252 is at variance with the intent of this Court in the promulgation of Rule 1252. The court below\u2019 very properly held that a writ of foreign attachment in an action ex delicto will not lie for torts committed outside the Commonwealth\u2019s boundaries.\nJudgment affirmed.\nThis complaint was later amended.\nIn Porter et al. v. Hildebrand, 14 Pa. 129, the Court said (p. 131) : \u201cIn its origin, and under the acts of 1705, and 1789, the process of foreign attachment furnished a remedy, simply for the recovery of debts or damages, arising ex contractu\u201d and then, commenting on an attempt to extend the circle of operation of foreign attachment to include tort actions, stated such would be \u201ca stride which would be more apt to attract admiration of its boldness than commendation of its wisdom.\u201d See: Jacoby v. Gogell, 5 S. & R. 450. In Strock v. Little, 45 Pa. 416, 419, Mr. Justice Woodwakd said: \u201cIt [foreign attachment] will not lie in actions sounding in tort, for- it was never designed as a remedy in such cases: . . .\u201d Mr. Justice Shabswood, speaking in Coleman's Appeal, 75 Pa. 441, 457, stated: \u201cIt will be seen from this brief review that it has not been the policy of our jurisprudence to bring non-residents within the jurisdiction of our courts unless in very special eases. In proceeding against them for torts, even property belonging to them cannot be reached by process . . .\u201d In Boyer v. Bullard, 102 Pa. 555, 557, we held that foreign attachment would not lie for a demand in tort. See also: Wood v. Virginia Hot Springs Co., 202 Pa. 40, 42, 51 A. 586.\nAct of June 21, 1911, P. L. 1097, \u00a71, 12 PS \u00a72891.\nAct of April 24, 1931, P. L. 44, No. 36, \u00a71, 12 PS \u00a72891.\nAdopted April 12, 1954 to become effective October 1, 1954."}
