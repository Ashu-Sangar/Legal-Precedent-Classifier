{"id": "485214", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM.\nAppellant was found guilty of murder in the first degree after a trial by jury. In this appeal he raises two issues. First, he alleges that the trial judge improperly instructed the jury. However, trial counsel made no objection to the charge as given, and this first issue, therefore, is beyond our consideration. Pa.R. Crim.P. 1119(b), 19 P.S. Appendix, and Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974).\nAppellant next argues that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to convict him of murder in the first degree. He contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the specific intent to kill was deficient. Viewing, as we must, the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we find the evidence presented to be sufficient beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e. g. Commonwealth v. Bederka, 459 Pa. 653, 331 A.2d 181 (1975); Commonwealth v. Hornberger, 441 Pa. 57, 270 A.2d 195 (1970); and Commonwealth v. Stukes, 435 Pa. 535, 257 A.2d 828 (1969).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed."}
