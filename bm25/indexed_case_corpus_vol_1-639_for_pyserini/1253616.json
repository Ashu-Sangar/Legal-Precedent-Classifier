{"id": "1253616", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Arnold,\nPlaintiff appeals, from the order of the court below refusing to take off a compulsory nonsuit entered in an action of trespass. The case arises out of the death of plaintiffs decedent after being struck by defendant\u2019s automobile.\nThe accident occurred on a twenty foot public highway at 10:30 A.M. on a clear, dry day. Decedent had been walking in a northerly direction on the berm and on his left side of the road. One Eckman, driving in the same direction, stopped his car on his side and \u201chollered back\u201d to offer decedent a ride. As he did so, he saw defendant\u2019s automobile about a \u201ccar length\u201d from decedent, proceeding southerly on the paved portion of the highway at a speed of 30 miles per hour. Eckman\u2019s warning to decedent of the car\u2019s approach was not heeded, and decedent \u201cwent to take a step . . . lost his balance . . . went forward and the car struck him.\u201d Defendant\u2019s ear was brought to a stop on the pavement within a \u201ccar length and a half\u201d from the point of collision, and the only skid marks were approximately one foot in length on the paved portion of the highway. The damage to defendant\u2019s car was on the side of the right headlight, the windshield, and the right door.\nPlaintiff contends that defendant was negligent because deceased was struck when \u201cstanding on the berm.\u201d The difficulty with this contention is that it is not supported by the evidence. Eckman testified: \u201cQ. Now, do.you know of your own knowledge as to whether Duda, the decedent, was on the paved portion or on the berm portion when he was struck? A. I couldn\u2019t say that. Q. What did he do if you know? A. It looked like he just took a step forward toward the pavement of the road. It looked like he lost his balance and kind of went forward and the car struck him. Q. And for that reason you weren\u2019t able to state whether or not Mr. Duda was on the pavement proper or alongside of the pavement; is that right? A. That is right.\u201d\nAlthough the plaintiff starts with the presumption that the deceased used due care, the presumption does not establish the negligence of the defendant. In Moore Exrx. v. Esso Standard Oil Company of Pennsylvania, 364 Pa. 343, 344, 345, 72 A. 2d 117, this Court affirmed on the opinion of Judge Sweney of the court below, in which that judge stated: \u201cTwo questions are here presented: (1) what effect, if any, does the presumption that decedent exercised due care have upon the question as to whether he was contributorily negligent as a matter of law; and (2) did plaintiff prove any negligence on the part of the defendants? The burden was upon the plaintiff to prove the defendants negligent by a preponderance of the evidence ... It is our opinion that the presumption of due care is a presumption of fact. As such, the presumption is not evidence and should not be substituted for evidence; it has no probative quality. [Citing Watkins v. Prudential Insurance Co., 315 Pa. 479] . . . One thing is clear and that is that the presumption of due care does not prove the defendant negligent; nor does the presumption take the case to the jury, without real proof of the defendant\u2019s negligence. The presumption has no significance, until plaintiff has made out a prima facie case of defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d See also Ebersole v. Beistline, 368 Pa. 12, 17, 82 A. 2d 11. The mere collision between the automobile and decedent-pedestrian does not prove negligence: Thompson v. Gorman, 366 Pa. 242, 246, 77 A. 2d 413.\nIn this case there is nothing which the jury could reasonably use as a basis for a finding of negligence in the defendant, and it is not permitted to speculate or guess: Lanni v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 371 Pa. 106, 110, 88 A. 2d 887.\nJudgment affirmed.\nEckman also testified that just before and immediately after the collision all four wheels of the defendant\u2019s car were on the pavement."}
