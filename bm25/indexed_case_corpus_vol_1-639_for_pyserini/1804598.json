{"id": "1804598", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPAPADAKOS, Justice.\nIn this appeal, we are called upon to determine whether the type of prosecutorial misconduct present in this case prohibits re-trial on double jeopardy grounds. We answer in the negative and affirm the decision of Superior Court, 342 Pa.Superior Ct. 281, 492 A.2d 1119, which remanded the case to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County for a new trial.\nIn July, 1975, Appellant, Lawrence Demetrius Simons, solicited Wayne Thorpe, Grant Ravenell and Angelo Casselle to rob Zollie Perry. While Appellant and Casselle waited in a car as lookouts, Thorpe and Ravenell, armed with handguns, approached Perry to rob him. Perry was also armed, and he shot Ravenell. Thorpe then shot Perry. The four conspirators fled. Perry died from the shooting, but Ravenell lived. In separate jury trials, first Simons, the mastermind, then Thorpe, the triggerman, were found guilty of second degree murder and robbery. In both trials, Ravenell and Casselle testified for the prosecution. Simons and Thorpe appealed. Each argued on appeal that a new trial should be granted because the prosecutor had concealed from each jury the terms of a plea agreement between Ravenell and the Commonwealth.\nIn Thorpe\u2019s case, we remanded to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on this issue. Superior Court, which at the time had cognizance of the Simons appeal, also remanded for a joint hearing with the Thorpe case. After hearing evidence on the issue, Judge John A. Geisz granted new trials to Thorpe and Simons in an Opinion and Order dated December 3, 1980. Thorpe and Simons then filed motions to dismiss the charges against them, asserting that re-trials would violate their right not to be placed twice in jeopardy. The trial court denied the motion, and, subsequently, Superior Court affirmed.\nOur analysis of double jeopardy must begin with a reaffirmation of the distinction between mere prosecutorial error and overreaching which \u201csignals the breakdown of the integrity of the judicial proceeding, and represents the type of prosecutorial tactic which the double jeopardy clause was designed to protect against.\u201d Commonwealth v. Starks, 490 Pa. 336, 341, 416 A.2d 498, 500 (1980); also see, Commonwealth v. Hallowell, 497 Pa. 203, 439 A.2d 1140 (1981). Because prosecutors are the representatives of an impartial sovereignty, we demand that they \u201care to seek justice, not only convictions.\u201d Commonwealth v. Cherry, 474 Pa. 295, 301, 378 A.2d 800, 803 (1977). It is the solemn responsibility of the prosecutor as the spokesman of the government, therefore, to conduct his affairs in court in a manner that will avoid designed grievous injury to the court\u2019s proceedings. Administrative error by a prosecutor is one thing; prosecutorial overreaching which triggers double jeopardy is another.\nClassification of overreaching by this Court in recent years has been subjected to different standards of review. Under Commonwealth v. Bolden, 472 Pa. 602, 373 A.2d 90 (1977), a defendant would be protected against reprosecution following a mistrial if the conduct of the judge or prosecutor was grossly negligent. This expansive interpretation of the standard of review in double jeopardy cases was repudiated in Commonwealth v. Klobuchir, 486 Pa. 241, 405 A.2d 881 (1979), cert. denied, 445 U.S. 952, 100 S.Ct. 1602, 63 L.Ed.2d 787, reh. denied, 446 U.S. 947, 100 S.Ct. 2178, 64 L.Ed.2d 804 (1980).\nThe next step in our analysis of prosecutorial overreaching occurred in 1980 in Commonwealth v. Starks, supra:\nThe United States Supreme Court has enunciated principally two types of prosecutorial overreaching. First there is the prosecutorial misconduct which is designed to provoke a mistrial in order to secure a second, perhaps more favorable, opportunity to convict the defendant. See United States v. Dinitz, [424 U.S. 600, 611, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 1081, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976)]. Second there is the prosecutorial misconduct undertaken in bad faith to prejudice or harass the defendant. See Lee v. United States, [432 U.S. 23, 32, 97 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 52 L.Ed.2d 80 (1977)]; United States v. Dinitz, supra, at 611, 96 S.Ct. at 1081-82. In contrast to prosecutorial error, overreaching is not an inevitable part of the trial process and cannot be condoned.\nUnder Starks, a re-trial was barred only if there was a bad faith effort by the prosecutor to prejudice the defendant or an intent to provoke a mistrial.\nStarks, of course, rested squarely on federal law and reflected the fact that we consistently had interpreted Pennsylvania\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause (Art. 1, \u00a7 10) to be co-extensive with the Fifth Amendment because of identical textual and policy considerations. Commonwealth v. Hogan, 482 Pa. 333, 393 A.2d 1133 (1978); Commonwealth v. Sparrow, 471 Pa. 490, 370 A.2d 712 (1977), (Mr. Justice Nix, now Chief Justice Nix, dissenting). Thus, our decisions had not created greater or lesser protection than the federal standard. See, e.g., Klobuchir, supra, (Nix, J., now Chief Justice Nix, Opinion in Support of Affirmance, joined by O\u2019Brien and Larsen, JJ.).\nUnder a Starks analysis, therefore, we established two types of overzealous prosecutions which were to be utilized in determining whether a mistrial precluded reprosecution: 1) prosecutorial acts intentionally designed to provoke a mistrial; or 2) misconduct which was undertaken in bad faith to harass the defendant deliberately. Commonwealth v. Virtu, 495 Pa. 59, 432 A.2d 198 (1981). As it related to mistrials, moreover, Pennsylvania\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause complied in all respects with the federal standard. Commonwealth v. Sample, 493 Pa. 347, 426 A.2d 582 (1981).\nThis dual mistrial step shifted perceptably in the United States Supreme Court decision in Oregon v. Kennedy, 456 U.S. 667, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982) (majority opinion by now Chief Justice Rehnquist, joined by Burger, then C.J., White and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concurrence by Powell, J.). Oregon stated:\nBecause of the confusion which these varying statements of the standard in question have occasioned in other courts, we deem it best to acknowledge the confusion and its justifiability in the light of these statements from previous decisions. We do not by this opinion lay down a flat rule that where a defendant in a criminal trial successfully moves for a mistrial, he may hot thereafter invoke the bar of double jeopardy in a second effort to try him are limited to those cases in which the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\nJustice Rehnquist\u2019s opinion recognized the fact that earlier opinions had broadened double jeopardy analysis from a more limited intent to provoke a mistrial to a more generalized standard of conduct deriving from bad faith efforts to harass the accused. Clearly, then, Oregon intends to prevent a new trial only where planned misconduct is calculated to force a mistrial. In thereby narrowing the standard of review, Justice Rehnquist understood as well that although the analysis raised some practical difficulties, it was still a \u201cmanageable standard which calls for the court simply to make a finding of fact by inferring the existence or non-existence of intent from objective facts and circumstances.\u201d Id., at 102 S.Ct. 2089.\nOregon alerts us to the need to reconsider the continuing validity of Starks. In Commonwealth v. Wallace, 500 Pa. 270, 455 A.2d 1187 (1983), Oregon was accepted as authority by Mr. Justice Nix, now Chief Justice, in his concurring opinion. Superior Court, in addition, already has accepted the new standard. In light of the altered basis of Starks, we now declare that henceforth double jeopardy will attach only to those mistrials which have been intentionally caused by prosecutorial misconduct. We do so with the full knowledge that we can establish greater protection for our state citizens than provided by the United States Supreme Court. Commonwealth v. Henderson, 496 Pa. 349, 437 A.2d 387 (1981); Commonwealth v. Hogan, 482 Pa. 333, 393 A.2d 1133 (1978). As in the rationale behind Starks, however, we again find a similarity of text and policy between our law and the federal decision in Oregon. Up to this point, of course, the Starks decision has been the law in this jurisdiction.\nBecause this case presently is on appeal, Oregon\u2019s standard of review applies immediately. The Appellant\u2019s right not to be held in double jeopardy, in any event, is not being damaged by this decision because we are describing anew only the present applicable standard of review and the circumstances which will cause double jeopardy to attach but not changing the right itself. The Appellant is getting the benefit of what our law mandates as it is being determined at the time of the appeal. Double jeopardy, nevertheless, continues to mean what it has always meant; no new rights were created by Starks nor are they being subtracted by virtue of this analysis. We find a recent analogy for this analysis in Commonwealth v. Gray, 509 Pa. 476, 503 A.2d 921 (1985), where we likewise altered the standard of review in cases involving probable cause for search warrants by adopting the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d test of Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). We concluded in Gray that \u201cGates did not create any new rights in defendants; it merely changed the analysis of the sufficiency of the probable cause allegation in a search warrant.\u201d Id., 509 Pa. at 927, 503 A.2d 921. See also, Massachusetts v. Upton, 466 U.S. 727, 104 S.Ct. 2085, 80 L.Ed.2d 721 (1984) (per curiam) for a similar analysis. In like manner, we now require new circumstances to satisfy the protection against double jeopardy in cases involving re-trial because of prosecutorial misconduct.\nThe facts of this case indicate that, indeed, an agreement was concluded among the trial court, Ravenell\u2019s attorney, and the assistant district attorney at the time when the witness Ravenell entered his guilty plea. The agreement was the usual commitment by the Commonwealth that it would recommend a lighter sentence in return for Ravenell\u2019s testimony. There is no controversy as to the existence of an accord along these lines. After Superior Court granted a remand for an evidentiary hearing on the claim, Commonwealth v. Simons, 275 Pa.Superior Ct. 564, 419 A.2d 44 (Special Transfer Docket 1980), Judge Geisz granted a new trial on the grounds that although the deal was described in general on cross-examination, the vital aspects of the plea agreement with Ravenell had not been fully disclosed at trial.\nPertinent testimony is as follows with Ravenell being cross-examined by Simons\u2019 defense counsel:\nQ. Now, was there any arrangement, if you know, between the District Attorney\u2019s office, Judge Della Porta, who heard the plea and yourself as to any sentence or time that you will get?\nA. No, sir.\nQ. So, there was no recommendation made at that time, was there?\nA. No, it wasn\u2019t.\nQ. Have you been sentenced?\nA. No, I haven\u2019t.\nQ. As a result of this plea, what do you expect to get out of this?\nA. I expect to go to jail.\nQ. Why?\nA. Because the Judge said that the crime I was involved in is \u2014 for me to go to jail.\nDid the Judge tell you what you could get at sentencing?\nMR. NOLAN: Objection.\nTHE COURT: Objection overruled.\nTHE WITNESS: He said that the maximum I could get for that is fifty years, I think he said. That was all the crimes included together with robbery, murder and store shot (sic) \u2014 I mean conspiracy and all of that.\nQ. So, that what you just told the jury, a few minutes ago, is not true?\nA. I just told you that I was planning to get justice for me.\nQ. You told them you didn\u2019t have any deal, you didn\u2019t expect\u2014\nA. That\u2019s not no deal.\nQ. \u2014favorable consideration for your cooperation, is not a deal, is that what you\u2019re saying?\nA. That\u2019s not a deal.\nQ. Not a deal?\nA. No.\nQ. Well, you pleaded \u2014 they let you plead guilty to third degree murder, didn\u2019t they?\nA. They let me plead third degree murder because I wanted to.\nQ. Because you wanted to?\nA. Yeah.\nQ. It was up to you, is that what you\u2019re saying?\nA. Well, not exactly.\nQ. Well, you say you wanted to. What did you mean? That you didn\u2019t want to plead guilty to first degree murder and that you wouldn\u2019t testify unless the District Attorney gave you a deal, is that what you mean?\nA. No. Wasn\u2019t like that.\nQ. Nothing like that.\nA. (Shakes head in the negative.)\nQ. Your lawyer hadn\u2019t made the deal yet, isn\u2019t that right?\nA. Didn\u2019t make no agreement or deal.\nQ. That\u2019s right. He didn\u2019t make it until November, is that right?\nA. I don\u2019t know anything about that.\nQ. You don\u2019t?\nA. No, I don\u2019t.\nQ. You don't remember appearing in Court in November with the testimony I just read to you where you pleaded guilty?\nA. That\u2019s pleading guilty. That\u2019s not saying to an agreement or a deal.\nQ. All right.\nYou remember being in Court when your lawyer made this statement at your guilty plea in return for his cooperation, the Commonwealth will make the fact of this cooperation known to the Judge at the time of sentencing and at that time of sentencing and that is, your Honor, further that at that time the Commonwealth will inform the Court of its favorable arrangements that were made including the question concerning any probable sentence.\nDo you remember your lawyer saying that to the sentencing Judge when you were in Court?\nA. Yes, he did.\nQ. So, there\u2019s a possibility or a probability that there will be no sentence in this case, isn\u2019t that right?\nA. Well, you have to go see him about that.\nDuring this testimony, the prosecutor did not affirm the existence of an agreement, and the Commonwealth argues that the omission was an administrative error due to the fact that the prosecutor at trial was a different person, and that the assistant district attorney who consummated the plea bargain had failed to communicate this fact. This argument need not concern us because under our law the office of the District Attorney is an entity. Commonwealth v. Wallace, 500 Pa. 270, 455 A.2d 1187 (1983).\nOur chief concern, of course, is whether the actions of the trial prosecutor may be characterized as the type of conduct which falls within Oregon. On the one hand, the testimony of the witness in open court casts serious doubt on the allegation that the arrangement was not disclosed to the jury. Certainly, the Commonwealth did not go to any length at all in an effort to hide, disguise, or lie about the fact that a bargain existed, and that alone extinguishes any claim that the prosecutor intended to provoke a mistrial. That the Commonwealth could have been more forthcoming in correcting any doubts created by Ravenell\u2019s imprecise testimony is true, as it is also correct to assert that the Office of the District Attorney could have operated more efficiently in such an important criminal case. Finally, the threshold requirement of Oregon has not been breached, and there is no manifest evidence to suggest that the prosecution wanted to provoke a mistrial.\nAccordingly, the Order of Superior Court is affirmed.\nFLAHERTY, J., files a concurring opinion joined by ZAPPALA, J.\nNIX, C.J., concurs in the result.\n.

Riffert, 322 Pa.Superior Ct. 230, 469 A.2d 267 (1983); no allocatur was filed in Beaver; allocatur was denied in Riffert on May 1, 1984."}
