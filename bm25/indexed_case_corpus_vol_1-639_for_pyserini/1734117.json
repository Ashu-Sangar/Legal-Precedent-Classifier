{"id": "1734117", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant was indicted for felony aggravated assault and for misdemeanor aggravated assault. On December 27, 1974, a jury found appellant guilty on the misdemeanor charge. The court sentenced appellant on April 28, 1975, to six to twenty-four months imprisonment at the Industrial Home for Women at Muncy. On May 23, 1975, the sentencing judge modified the original sentence to six to twenty-three months in Union County Jail. Appellant appealed to the Superior Court which affirmed in a per curiam order. We granted allocatur.\nAppellant contends that her sentence of total confinement should be vacated because it is manifestly excessive. She also asserts that no reasonable explanation was given for imposing a sentence of total confinement, and that the sentence is contrary to Pennsylvania\u2019s statutory sentencing guidelines, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1321 et seq. (Supp.1977). We agree that the trial court failed to articulate a reason for the sentence imposed, reflecting due consideration was given to the statutory sentencing guidelines. We therefore vacate judgment of sentence and remand for resentencing.\nTwo police officers stopped a van in which appellant was a passenger because the driver, appellant\u2019s boyfriend, made an illegal \u201cU\u201d-turn. A struggle between the driver and the two police officers developed. At first, appellant remained in the van. Later, she got out of the van and began pleading with the officers to stop hitting the driver. After her protestations failed, appellant struck one officer once on the back with a stick and kicked the other officer as he attempted to handcuff her. Appellant was arrested without further incident. Neither officer was seriously injured.\nAt the first sentencing proceeding, appellant\u2019s trial counsel argued that, under the new Sentencing Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1321 et seq. (Supp.1977), probation would be appropriate in light of the circumstances of the offense, appellant\u2019s background, and her potential for rehabilitation. The record indicates appellant accepted the blame for her conduct. Prior to trial, she offered to plead guilty to the misdemeanor assault charge, the offense for which she was later convicted; the Commonwealth insisted on going forward with the felony assault charge. Appellant showed remorse during her testimony. She had no prior criminal record nor any involvement with drugs or alcohol. She was attending a community college at the time of the incident. The parole investigator who prepared the pre-sentence report said appellant \u201cwas cooperative and answered all questions sincerely.\u201d\nAppellant\u2019s counsel made specific reference to the provisions in the Sentencing Code which favor probation. In addition, at the sentencing modification proceeding, appellant\u2019s counsel directed the court\u2019s attention to 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1321(b) (Supp.1977) which provides:\n\u201cIn selecting from the alternatives set forth in subsection (a) of this section the court shall follow the general principle that the sentence imposed should call for the minimum amount of confinement that is consistent with the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense, and the rehabilitative needs of the defendant.\u201d\nDespite counsel\u2019s argument and the existence of the statutory sentencing guidelines, the court sentenced appellant to a minimum of six months imprisonment and possible imprisonment of nearly two years. Appellant asserts, and the record reflects, that the trial judge failed to articulate reasons for the sentence imposed reflecting \u201cweight\u201d was accorded the statutory guidelines for sentencing.\n\u201cBy the Court: I just can\u2019t imagine this happening. I can\u2019t imagine any young person that has lived in a free society such as the United States has to offer in a violation of this kind. A simple motor vehicle violation where your friend was just served with a citation. This would have meant if he would have had any complaint it could have been handled in a very democratic way. He could have had his day in court and would not have been involved in any way other than a possible fine, more than likely. . . . And yet both you and he, not only was this a matter of complaining to law enforcement officers, this was an act of violence toward them. I just can\u2019t imagine this. And I can't understand your boyfriend. That is my concern. I know very little about you. . The fact that you have not been involved with the law would lead me to believe that you could use your good judgment in respect to what happened on that day.' I am not saying you might not have been disgusted, the fact your friend was being arrested, but to turn on a law enforcement officer is a mystery to me. And since it is, I know of no other solution but to punish you for it. I see no reason whatsoever.\nI feel I have no alternative in this regard. I have to do it, because I must admit everything that has happened since this would lead me to believe Miss Kostka is not this kind of person. But, I can\u2019t imagine anyone doing this. It hasn\u2019t any sense at all.\nI just can\u2019t, I don\u2019t know what you would do at some future time. I just can\u2019t. Well, I simply can\u2019t tolerate what you did . . . .\u201d (emphasis added)\nAs these comments indicate, the trial court did not consider the relevant statutory provisions designed to guide its discretion. Although the probation guidelines in the Sentencing Code do not exclusively control the discretion of the trial court, the Code mandates that the grounds listed be \u201caccorded weight.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1322 (Supp.1977). Nowhere in the record of the sentencing proceedings does it appear that the trial court considered these grounds. Nor did the trial court consider the section of the Sentencing Code governing situations where total, as opposed to partial, confinement is appropriate. Moreover, from the discussion which does appear on the record, it seems that the trial court improperly considered the conduct of the driver, appellant\u2019s boyfriend, in imposing the sentence of total confinement upon appellant.\nIn Commonwealth v. Riggins, 474 Pa. 115, 377 A.2d 140 (1977) (plurality opinion), this Court considered important principles guiding the imposition of sentence. In Riggins, we held that a trial judge must articulate the reasons for the sentence selected and enumerated the reasons favoring such a requirement. Although, unlike the present case, the imposition of sentence in Riggins preceded the effective date of the new Sentencing Code, we there stated:\n\u201cThe Legislature, in recognizing the need for sentencing guidelines, has enacted the Sentencing Code. Section 1321(a) of the Code provides for five possible dispositions-probation, guilt without further penalty, partial confinement, total confinement, and a fine. The Legislature has adopted the following basic policy to guide the trial court in imposing sentence: \u2018[T]he sentence imposed should call for the minimum amount of confinement that is consistent with the protection of the public, the gravity of the offense, and the rehabilitative need of the defendant.\u2019 The Legislature has also enumerated specific factors which the trial court should consider in determining which of the five possible dispositions is appropriate for a particular defendant. These factors provide the sentencing court with guidelines for the articulation of the reasons for its sentencing decision. Absent a statement of reasons, the record will not reveal whether the legislatively mandated factors have been considered.\u201d (footnotes omitted)\nId. 474 Pa. at -, 377 A.2d at 149-50. See generally American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures (Approved Draft, 1968).\nHere the record does not reveal whether \u201cthe legislatively mandated factors have been considered.\u201d We therefore vacate the judgment of sentence and remand the case to afford the trial court an opportunity to consider the legislatively pronounced guidelines and to resentence appellant accordingly, including in the record a statement of reasons for the sentence imposed.\nJudgment of sentence vacated and case remanded.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2702 (1973).\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp.1977).\n. Because we vacate and remand for resentencing on this ground, we need not address appellant\u2019s claim that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.\n. The record indicates that the stick was a nun-chukas, an instrument used in practicing martial arts. The record also indicates that the nun-chukas did not belong to appellant, but that she picked it up from the ground where it had earlier been dropped.\n. The officer struck on the back testified he suffered one minor bruise. The other officer claimed the leg pain and disability he later experienced was caused by appellant\u2019s kick. However, the record does not support this claim since the officer had several related pre-existing injuries and no medical testimony was presented to establish causation. Indeed, the jury acquitted appellant of the felony aggravated assault charge which differs from the misdemean- or assault charge only in the seriousness of the bodily injury which results.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1322 (Supp.1977) provides:\nThe following grounds, while not controlling the discretion of the court, shall be accorded weight in favor of an order of probation:\n(1) The criminal conduct of the defendant neither caused nor threatened serious harm.\n(2) The defendant did not contemplate that his conduct would cause or threaten serious harm.\n(3) The defendant acted under a strong provocation.\n(4) There were substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the criminal conduct of the defendant, though failing to establish a defense.\n(5) The victim of the criminal conduct of the defendant induced or facilitated its commission.\n(6) The defendant has compensated or will compensate the victim of his criminal conduct for the damage or injury that he sustained.\n(7) The defendant has no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial period of time before the commission of the present crime.\n(8) The criminal conduct of the defendant was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur.\n(9) The character and attitudes of the defendant indicate that he is unlikely to commit another crime.\n(10) The defendant is particularly likely to respond affirmatively to probationary treatment.\n(11) The confinement of the defendant would entail excessive hardship to him or his dependents.\n(12) Such other grounds as indicate the desirability of probation.\n. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1325 (Supp.1977) provides:\n\u201cThe court shall impose a sentence of total confinement if, having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and the history, character, and condition of the defendant, it is of the opinion that the total confinement of the defendant is necessary because:\n(1) there is undue risk that during a period of probation or partial confinement the defendant will commit another crime;\n(2) the defendant is in need of correctional treatment that can be provided most effectively by his commitment to an institution; or\n(3) a lesser sentence will depreciate the seriousness of the crime of the defendant.\n. Clearly, it would be improper to sentence appellant on the basis of her boyfriend\u2019s conduct. Likewise, it would be improper to sentence appellant solely on the basis of her conduct without considering the mitigating and extenuating circumstances. It is well-established in Pennsylvania that a trial court must consider a defendant\u2019s background, individual characteristics, and relative culpability or prospects for rehabilitation prior to imposing sentence. Commonwealth v. Martin, 466 Pa. 118, 351 A.2d 650 (1976). Yet appellant\u2019s conduct and the conduct of her boyfriend are the only two considerations which appear on the record."}
