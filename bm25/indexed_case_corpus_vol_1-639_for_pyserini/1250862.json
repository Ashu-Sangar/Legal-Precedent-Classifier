{"id": "1250862", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nThe trustees under the will of Samuel Dickson, deceased, filed a Fourth Account at the audit of which his son, Arthur G. Dickson, the life tenant, claimed he was then entitled to 4/7ths of the principal of the trust by a coalescence or merger of the life estate and remainder interest.\nTestator left his residuary estate in trust to pay the income to his son Arthur for his life, remainder to his children or issue, if any, and if he left no child or issue living at his death \u201cto the nieces of my late wife living at the time of my death.\u201d\nTestator was survived (1) by a son who is 79 years of age, who has no children or issue, and (2) by 7 nieces of his wife, 3 of whom are still living and 4 of whom have died without issue. Testator\u2019s son claims that he is immediately entitled to 4/7ths of the remainder of the estate on the ingenious theory that since it is impossible for him to have children or issue, there was an intestacy as to these remainder interests and since he is the testator\u2019s sole heir, his life estate merged or coalesced with the remainder. There are many reasons why this appeal must fail, several of which we shall discuss.\nIn the first place Dickson no longer has a life estate, and consequently there could not possibly be a merger.\nDickson went into bankruptcy in 1932. The trustee in bankruptcy sold at public auction all the right, title and interest of the bankrupt under the will of his father, Samuel Dickson, including his life estate in (one-half of) the net income therefrom. This interest was purchased by Henry S. Drinker, Jr., individually, and also for and on behalf of the law firm of Drinker, Biddle & Reath. Mr. Drinker and Drinker, Biddle & Reatli thereupon created an irrevocable trust to which they transferred, assigned and delivered to the Fidelity-Philadelphia Trust Company all of the aforesaid right, title and interest which Drinker had purchased at the bankruptcy sale. This trust provided, inter alia, that the trustee should hold the said estate in trust to pay the net income quarterly to Arthur G. Dickson for his life, and upon his death to convey, assign, transfer and pay over all property then held by the trustee to his wife. Mr. Dickson\u2019s wife is now deceased. The trust deed also contained the usual spendthrift trust provisions. It is obvious that this inter vivos trust with its spendthrift trust provisions is not the same as the life estate created for Arthur G. Dickson in the will of his father.\nIn order to create an intestacy, Dickson contends that it is impossible for him to have any children and he offered to prove by expert medical testimony that such was the fact. An intestacy is, of course, an important and absolutely indispensible link in the chain of his argument, because his father\u2019s will gave the remainder interest not to Arthur but to Arthur\u2019s surviving children and issue (of deceased children), with a contingent gift over, upon failure of such children and issue, to the nieces of testator\u2019s late wife living at testator\u2019s death.\nFor centuries the law was well settled that \u201c \u2018A possibility of issue is always supposed to exist in law . . . even though the donees be each of them an hundred years old\u2019: 2 Blackstone\u2019s Com. 125\u201d; List v. Rodney, 83 Pa. 483, 492. See to the same effect: Austin\u2019s Estate, 315 Pa. 449, 451, 173 A. 278; Sterrett\u2019s Estate, 300 Pa. 116, 123, 150 A. 159 (the life tenant was 78 years of age) ; Straus\u2019s Estate, 307 Pa. 454, 459, 161 A. 547. We need not now decide this question. Suffice it to say that even if such evidence were admissible and the fact was proved that Arthur G. Dickson was incapable of having children because of his age and his physical condition, it would not cause an intestacy in this case; since the gift to the nieces living at testator\u2019s death was contingent: Straus Estate, 351 Pa. 136, 138, 40 A. 2d 402; Bomberger Estate, 347 Pa. 465, 469, 32 A. 2d 729; Frasier v. Scranton Gas & Water Co., 249 Pa. 570, 95 A. 256; but transmissible: cf. Riegel v. Oliver, 352 Pa. 244, 248, 42 A. 2d 602; Crawford Estate, 362 Pa. 458, 67 A. 2d 124; Estate of Rebecca Moss, 80 Pa.

Moreover, even if it were impossible for Dickson to have children this would not suffice to effectuate a merger of this life estate with a remainder interest obtained (if at all) through intestacy : Moore\u2019s Estate, 198 Pa. 611, 48 A. 884.\nIn Moore\u2019s Estate. the Court said (p. 612) : \u201cIt is said, however, that;1' the life estates given to the sons by the will were merged in the fee or absolute interests in the remainder or reversion which they took under the intestate laws by reason of the failure of the gift to charities, . . . thus entitling the sons to the estate discharged of the trust. But merger can only take place where the interests meeting in the same person are of the same character, either both legal or both equitable; obviously it cannot take, place where the life estate is under a trust which the law recognizes as valid, and the ownership, of the remainder is legal.\n\u201cIt is a principle so familiar as scarcely to require reference to authority, that where two estates meet, merger will not be permitted if the purposes of the creation of one of them require that they should remain distinct. See Dougherty v. Jack, 5 Watts, 456, and Forbes v. Moffatt, 18 Vesey, 394. An equitable life estate will not coalesce with a legal remainder to the heirs of the first taker and thus cause a trust to protect from creditors to fail (Rife v. Geyer, 9 P. F. Smith, 395), . . .\u201d See also Moser\u2019s Estate, 270 Pa. 217, 113 A. 199; Rehr v.
