{"id": "1941750", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Jones,\nJohn Horvath (testator) died January 8, 1959, survived by his widow and two daughters, Mary Achter (appellant) and Julia Holmes. Under his will\u2014dated August 31, 1956\u2014testator set up a trust under which testator\u2019s widow was to receive the net income during her lifetime and \u201cthen upon the death of [his] said wife, if she shall survive [him],\u201d testator directed:\n\u201cI give and devise to my daughter, Mary Horvath Achter, my property No. 1622 North Second Street, Harrisburg, Pa., provided that within six months after my death or my said wife\u2019s death, whichever shall last happen, she pays to my daughter Julia Horvath, the sum of One Thousand (f1,000) Dollars in cash,\n\u201cI give and devise to my daughter, Julia Horvath, my residence property No. 2328 State Street, Harrisburg, Pa.\n\u201cAll the rest of my estate or trust estate aforesaid I give and bequeath to my said daughters in equal shares.\u201d\nJulia predeceased her mother, the life tenant, and was survived by her husband. The life tenant died April 29, 1969. Upon the life tenant\u2019s death, the trustee filed its final account. Appellant filed exceptions to the distribution proposed in the account which were subsequently dismissed and a final decree entered by the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. The instant appeal was then taken.\nAppellant\u2019s first contention is that the interest given by testator to Julia was not vested but contingent upon her survival of testator\u2019s widow, the life tenant, and, therefore, since Julia predeceased the life tenant, her interest did not vest. The primary consideration in the construction and interpretation of wills is that testator\u2019s intent, if ascertainable, should prevail. E. g., Pearson Estate, 442 Pa. 172, 180, 275 A. 2d 336, 339 (1971); McKinney Estate, 435 Pa. 608, 612, 258 A. 2d 632, 634 (1969); Carter Estate, 435 Pa. 492, 496-7, 257 A. 2d 843, 845 (1969). This intention is to be garnered, if at all, from an examination of the testamentary language and scheme of the will. E.g., Woodward Estate, 407 Pa. 638, 182 A. 2d 732 (1962). \u201cIf the language employed by the testator in disposing of his estate is plain and clearly discloses his intention, the will interprets itself and no rules of construction are necessary to aid in its interpretation.\u201d England Estate, 414 Pa. 115, 200 A. 2d 897 (1964). See, also, Lewis Estate, 407 Pa. 518, 180 A. 2d 919 (1962); Buzby Estate, 386 Pa 1, 123 A. 2d 723 (1956).\nWhen the language in a will is ambiguous, we resort to canons of construction. See, Newlin Estate, 367 Pa. 527, 80 A. 2d 819 (1951); Wood Estate, 321 Pa. 497, 184 Atl. 13 (1936); Weir Estate, 307 Pa. 461, 161 Atl. 730 (1932) ; Mulliken v. Earnshaw, 209 Pa. 226, 58 Atl. 286 (1904). Moreover, we have also articulated a presumption in favor of the vesting of interests when dealing with ambiguous language. E.g., Newlin Estate, supra; Neel Estate, 252 Pa. 394, 97 Atl. 502 (1916); Tatham Estate, 250 Pa. 269, 95 Atl. 520 (1915).\nFrom our examination of the language of this will, testator\u2019s intent seems clear and we need not resort to any canon of construction or presumption in order to determine whether Julia\u2019s interest is vested or contingent. Testator mentioned three objects of his bounty, his wife and two daughters. His will clearly spells out his intent to provide a place of residence, maintenance and charge free, for his wife during her lifetime and a distribution to her of all the net income which his estate produced and a distribution, upon her death, as directed in the will of the balance of the estate to his two daughters. In so providing, testator attempted to equalize what each daughter would receive.\nA century ago, this Court, in McClure\u2019s Appeal, 72 Pa. 414 (1872), was faced with a fairly similar factual situation. In McClure, testator gave the \u201cwhole\u201d of his realty to his widow for life or widowhood and one-half of his real estate for her life if she remarried; provision was then made for a sale of the realty, on the wife\u2019s death, and a division of the proceeds among certain-named nephews and nieces equally; one niece married and predeceased the life tenant. In awarding her legacy to her husband, this Court held the deceased niece\u2019s interest was vested and not contingent, the interest vesting immediately on testator\u2019s death and only the time of enjoyment of that interest being postponed. See also, Chew\u2019s Appeal, 37 Pa. 23 (1861).\n\" In the case at bar, Julia had a vested interest which passed to her husband.\nAppellant next contends that the word \u201cthen\u201d appearing in another clause of the will\u2014\u201cand then upon the death of-my wife,\u201d\u2014clearly expresses the time for determination of the distributees, thereby defeating the devise or bequest to Julia Holmes. We stated in Vandergrift Estate, 406 Pa. 14, 33, 177 A. 2d 432, 441 (1962) : \u201cThe word \u2018then\u2019 is used in this will as a conjunction' meaning \u2018in that event\u2019, not as an adverb meaning \u2018at that time\u2019.\u201d It is our opinion from a reading of the entire will that the expression employed by the testator, \u201cand then upon the death of my wife,\u201d is used in the sense of \u201cin that event\u201d rather than signifying the time when the remainder interest of his daught\u00e9rs would vest.\n. Lastly, appellant urges that the result of the decree-below is to award distribution of Julia\u2019s share to her husband, who was not of testator\u2019s blood line. Within the' four corners of this will there is nothing whatsoever indicating an intent on testator\u2019s part to restrict his bounty to those of his own blood and to exclude persons not of the blood.' Indeed, had such been testator\u2019s intent he had ample time to revise his will to exclude possible inheritance by Julia\u2019s husband. While Julia was unmarried when the will was executed, she did marry within six months and testator. had two years thereafter in which, had he so desired, he could have excluded Julia\u2019s husband. This argument lacks merit.\nSince we conclude that Julia\u2019s interest was vested, not contingent, we need not consider whether the property devised to Julia passed through the residuary clause of the will to appellant. The contingency which called for a \u201cgift over\u201d never occurred.\nDecree affirmed. Appellant to pay costs.\nThe former Mr. Chief Justice Bell and the former Mr. Justice Barbieri took no part in the decision of this case.\nThe trustee was directed to maintain testator\u2019s residence from the income of the estate and to permit testator\u2019s widow and daughter, Julia (then unmarried) \u201cto live therein free of any charge or rent as long as [testator\u2019s widow] shall live.\u201d This residence property is known as 2328 State Street, Harrisburg."}
