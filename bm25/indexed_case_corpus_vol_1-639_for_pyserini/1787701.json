{"id": "1787701", "contents": "OPINION\nMcDermott, justice.\nThe issue in this appeal is the same as that presented in Bindex Corp. v. City of Pittsburgh, 504 Pa. 584, 475 A.2d 1320 (1984): whether appellant\u2019s activities as a commercial illustrator entitles her to an exemption from the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s Business Privilege Tax. The facts of this case are set forth below.\nAppellant, Dorothy D. Tucker, t/a Lynn Dohoney, was a self-employed commercial illustrator during the 1977 calendar year. Appellant\u2019s work involved producing illustrations for a variety of clients, to be used by them for billboards, newspapers, advertising, etc.\nIn 1978, appellant claimed a manufacturing exemption for the Privilege Tax. Pursuant to the Local Tax Enabling Act (LTEA), local taxing authorities are prohibited from levying taxes on manufacturers. See 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6902(4). The exemption claim was denied by the city, and following a Treasurer\u2019s Hearing the denial was affirmed. Appellant subsequently appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, which sustained her claim. The Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that she was not a manufacturer. Appellant herein petitioned this court for allowance of appeal and we granted allocatur.\nExamination of the instant case reveals the following about appellant\u2019s activities as an illustrator. Once a client was obtained, appellant artist would be given the concept the client wished to express. Appellant would then filter the idea through her imagination, articulate it with her gift of sketch and color. Appellant and client would then pore over the sketch, discuss changes, adding light or shade until what the client sought was manifest. Appellant was equipped with papers, dyes, paints, spray varnish, all the paraphernalia required to give the imagination form and body. When all the artistic touches were rendered, the appellant artist would deliver the illustration to the client for whatever uses suited their purpose.\nAs we noted in Bindex, supra, the task of defining \u201cmanufacturing\u201d has been with us for over a century. In Norris Brothers v. Commonwealth, 27 Pa. 494 (1856), this Court defined \u201cmanufacturing\u201d as:\n\u201cIt is making. It consists in giving new shapes, new qualities, or new combinations to matter which has already gone through some artificial process.\u201d\nId. at 496.\nIn Philadelphia School District v. Rosenberg, 402 Pa. 365, 167 A.2d 259 (1961), we added \u201cthat it is the popular or practical understanding of what is manufacturing that prevails and is intended.\u201d Id., 402 Pa. at 368, 167 A.2d at 260. Utilizing these definitions \u201cmanufacturing\u201d becomes the transformation of matter or a thing into something that it was not: giving it new shape and form, new qualities or new combinations of quality or usefulness. See Golden Triangle, etc. v. City of Pittsburgh, 483 Pa. 525, 529, 397 A.2d 1147, 1149 (1979).\nDefinitions must be considered in the light of the need that requires the definition. The need here is to distinguish for the purpose of taxation. \u201cManufacture\u201d is excluded from the tax ostensibly to encourage it or because it is taxed otherwise. Therefore it must be different than mere transfer, barter, packaging or sale of a thing or the addition of a color or a ribbon. The process must alter or change the thing itself into something different, new and useful. As we said in Commonwealth v. Berlo Vending Company, 415 Pa. 101, 202 A.2d 94 (1964):\n\u201cIt (manufacturing) consists in the application of labor or skill to material whereby the original article is changed into a new, different and useful article.\u201d\nId., 415 Pa. at 104, 202 A.2d at 96 (citing Philadelphia School District v. Parent Mental Products, Inc., 402 Pa. 361, 364, 167 A.2d 257, 258-259 (1961)).\nWhile we hesitate to compare or draw an analogy to the instant case from Berio, where we held that processing popcorn kernels into popped, edible, colored popcorn was not manufacturing, it proves a point. The instant case should also prove a point, both in kind and quality.\nThe appellant artist follows an intellectual, imaginative and creative process; she receives a thought and creates a picture; articulates by paint and varnish, an idea. As the Commonwealth Court said,\n\u201cIt is the intellectual creative aspect of appellee\u2019s activities which are dominant.\u201d\nPity of Pittsburgh v. Tucker, 74 Pa.Cmwlth.Ct. 290, 295, 459 A.2d 1333, 1336 (1983). She creates what can be later made, what others can manufacture. She uses color and skill and hopefully adds to the pleasures of the world. In small recompense, she is not in the \u201cpopular or practical understanding\u201d a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d any more than one would say Michaelangelo \u201cmanufactured\u201d David or Vergil the Aeneid.\nThe Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\n. Pittsburgh\u2019s Business Privilege Tax, City Ordinance No. 675 of 1968, as amended, imposes a five-mill-per-dollar tax on the gross receipts for the privilege of engaging in business within the city.\n. Act of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, \u00a72 as amended, 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6901 et seq."}
