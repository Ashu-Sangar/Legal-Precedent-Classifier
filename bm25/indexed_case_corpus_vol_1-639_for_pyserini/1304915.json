{"id": "1304915", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThe cause of action in this case began as a mechanic\u2019s lien proceeding but, by agreement of the parties, was tried as an action of assumpsit so that the defendants could plead a counterclaim. The plaintiff\u2019s claim was for $23,000, the defendants\u2019 counterclaim for $5,200.\nThe jury rejected the defendants\u2019 counterclaim and returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $19,000 for labor performed and equipment employed in behalf of the defendants under both a written agreement and subsequent oral agreements between the parties.\nThe defendants have appealed from the judgment in favor of the plaintiffs which was entered after the lower court\u2019s dismissal of the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. They do not question the sufficiency or weight of the evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict but assert that various trial errors entitle them to a new trial.\nThe case was well tried by experienced attorneys before Judge Pinola, able and veteran trial jurist. His opinion thoroughly and properly disposed of all issues raised by the appellants. Thus, there is no reason for this Court to file a formal opinion in the case, especially since the questions involved were factual.\nJudgment affirmed."}
