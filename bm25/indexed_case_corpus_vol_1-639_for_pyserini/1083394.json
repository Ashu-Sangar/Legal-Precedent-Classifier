{"id": "1083394", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis is a suit to recover damages for the alleged fraudulent destruction of a codicil to the will of plaintiff\u2019s mother, by which, it is averred, testatrix gave her daughter an income considerably larger than provided for the latter in the probated document. As is correctly said by the court below, plaintiff, in prior proceedings recited in her statement of claim, shows \u201ca complete adjudication [against herself] of the question of whether or not there ever was......in the hands of these defendants,......a codicil\u201d such as she now alleges: see Lawman\u2019s Est., 272 Pa. 237. This being the case, no error was committed in sustaining the demurrer and entering judgment for defendants.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
