{"id": "1922651", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nOn the morning of March 1,1967, the body of Thomas Serenko was found on a country road near the Borough of Portage in Cambria. County. An investigation of\u2019 the crime was begun by a Corporal Pelesky of the State Police and two other officers. An autopsy performed on the body of the deceased revealed that the cause of death was a bullet wound from a .22 caliber gun.\nSome time during the day Corporal Pelesky received a report that appellant had been seen with a .22 revolver the previous day. Pelesky obtained a search warrant for a .22 revolver from Ralph George, who served as mayor and as justice of the peace of Portage. Armed with the warrant, Pelesky and two other officers arrived at appellant\u2019s home around 11:00 p.m. on March 1. When asked about the gun, appellant told Pelesky that he had given it to one Robert Kline. Pelesky then called the juvenile probation officer of Cambria County. Since appellant, seventeen years old at the time, was on probation as a juvenile offender, the officer told Pelesky to take him to the juvenile detention center for violating his parole by carrying a gun. Pelesky took appellant to the office of Mayor George in Portage; he did not take appellant to the detention center in Ebensburg because he first wanted to search Robert Kline\u2019s home in an effort to recover the gun that night.\nAppellant remained with Mayor George while Pelesky and the two officers went to Kline\u2019s home. While appellant was sitting in Mayor George\u2019s office three other persons were present; Mayor George and two police officers from another municipality who were entirely unconnected with the murder investigation or the search for the .22 revolver. About a half hour after appellant was brought to the mayor\u2019s office, Mayor George asked him about the gun, and appellant told him that he got the gun from a person named Ralph who lived in Johnstown.\nThat which then ensued is critical to the question of the admissibility of an oral statement made by appellant. All three persons testified. substantially to the same effect as to what took place, and appellant\u2019s version does not seriously dispute it. The mayor and the two police officers were carrying on a conversation between themselves, and Mayor George looked over toward appellant, who was \u201csitting there with his head down and looked out of this world.\u201d Mayor George said: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Mike, you look kind of down in the dumps; do you want to talk? He [appellant] said, I want to, but I can\u2019t. I said, well, if you want to talk, talk.\u201d At that point appellant orally confessed to having killed Serenko. Mayor George then notified police officers who were in an adjoining room, and thereafter a written statement which was not introduced into evidence was taken from appellant after he had been warned of his Miranda rights for the first time.\nAt a pre-trial suppression hearing appellant attacked the admissibility of the oral statement given in Mayor George\u2019s office, but the court below ruled that the oral confession was not the product of \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d and that, therefore, it was not necessary to warn the appellant of his Miranda rights before he volunteered the statement. Appellant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and took this -appeal.\nThis case is controlled by the statement of the Supreme Court of the United States in Miranda that: \u201c[T]he prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 1612 (1966). Since it is conceded that appellant was not given any warnings before the oral confession, the issue we must decide is whether appellant\u2019s oral confession was the product of \u201ccustodial interrogation.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth claims there was no \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d for three reasons: first, although appellant was in custody, he was not in custody for the crime to which he eventually confessed; second, the investigation of the murder had not focused on the appellant as a suspect; third, the questions asked by Mayor George did not amount to interrogation.\nThe first contention is answered by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent opinion in Mathis v. United States, 391 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1503 (1968). Mathis was questioned by an Internal Revenue Service agent while in jail serving a sentence for an unrelated offense about certain tax refunds Mathis had claimed the IRS agent did not give Mathis his Miranda warnings before questioning him. Information elicited from Mathis eventually led to a criminal prosecution and conviction for knowingly filing false claims. Mathis attacked the admissibility of statements he had given the agent. The government argued that there was no custodial interrogation since Mathis was in custody for an offense unrelated to tax evasion. The Supreme Court summarily rejected this argument: \u201cWe find nothing in the Miranda opinion which calls for a curtailment of the warnings to be given persons under interrogation by officers based on the reason why the person is in custody. In speaking of \u2018custody\u2019 the language of the Miranda opinion is clear and unequivocal : \u2018To summarize, we hold that when an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning, the privilege against self-incrimination is jeopardized.\u2019 384 U.S. at 478.\u201d 391 U.S. at 4-5, 88 S. Ct. at 1505. In short, as soon as a defendant is placed in custody for any reason, he must be given his Miranda warnings before he is interrogated. We have no doubt that, while appellant was in Mayor George\u2019s office, he was \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of such phrase in Escobedo and Miranda and that he was entitled to be given the Miranda warnings before being questioned by the police.\nThe Commonwealth maintains that there is a second factor we must consider \u2014 whether the investigation of the murder had begun to focus on the appellant. This requirement is derived from Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 490-91, 84 S. Ct. 1758, 1764-65 (1964) : \u201cWe hold, therefore, that where, as here, the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the suspect has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied \u2018the Assistance of Counsel\u2019 in violation of the Sixth Amendment. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) See Commonwealth v. Jefferson, 423 Pa. 541, 545-46, 226 A. 2d 765, 768 (1967). The Supreme Court clarified this particular holding in Miranda: \u201cBy custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d Footnote 4 states, \u201cThis is what we meant in Escobedo when we spoke of an investigation which had focused on an accused.\u201d 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S. Ct. at 1612. We interpret this to mean, in conjunction with Mathis, that when an individual is placed in custody for any reason, he cannot be interrogated without first being advised of Ms rights regardless of whether the investigation has focused on him as a suspect in a particular crime. The focusing test continues to be relevant in determining whether an individual is in custody, see Jefferson, supra.\nVery recently, this Court in Commonwealth v. Feldman, 432 Pa. 428, 248 A. 2d 1 (1968), said: \u201cFrom reading Escobedo and Miranda together it becomes clear that whenever an individual is questioned while in custody or while the object of an investigation of which he is the focus, before any questioning begins the individual must be given the warnings established in Miranda [citing authorities].\u201d Thus we need not decide whether appellant was at the time of the incident in the mayor\u2019s office the focus of an investigation because appellant was clearly occupying an \u201cin custody\u201d status.\nFinally the Commonwealth argues that appellant\u2019s statement was purely voluntary and thus not within the proscription of Miranda. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 478, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 1630 (1966); cf. Commonwealth v. Feldman, supra; Commonwealth ex rel. Vanderpool v. Russell, 426 Pa. 499, 233 A. 2d 246 (1967); Commonwealth v. Fperjesi, 423 Pa. 455, 224 A. 2d 216 (1966). However, this is not a case where appellant, unencouraged, began to blurt out his confession. Although appellant may have been tMnking of confessing, something was making him think that he should not, and the first move was made not by him but by the mayor who urged appellant to \u201ctalk.\u201d This should be sufficient to necessitate Miranda warnings. Once the mayor said \u201cyou look kind of down in the dumps ... if you want to talk, talk,\u201d he should have also been obligated to inform appellant of the consequences of any statement and of his constitutional right to remain silent and to be assisted by counsel. \u201c[I]t is not simply custody plus \u2018questioning/ as such, which calls for the Miranda safeguards but custody plus police conduct [here the mayor\u2019s conduct] calculated to, expected to, or likely to, evoke admissions.\u201d Institute of Continuing Legal Education, \u201cCriminal Law and the Constitution \u2014 Sources and Commentaries\u201d 356 (1968) (Emphasis in original).\nIt simply is not enough to mechanically attempt to ascertain what \u201cinterrogation\u201d means without considering the rationales behind Miranda and the fifth and sixth amendments. Our basic theory of criminal law is that an accused should be assisted by counsel and should not be convicted by evidence from his own mouth. Miranda simply requires that an accused be told of his rights. It in no way precludes the use of voluntary confessions, but merely requires the giving of certain warnings so that an accused can make a knowledgeable decision whether to confess. The requirement of \u201cinterrogation\u201d is designed to permit the use by the prosecution of a confession that is given by an accused without any prompting, before warnings can be given.\nThat is hardly the situation here. The mayor knew exactly for what appellant was being held, having issued the search warrant for the gun sought as the murder weapon, a gun which the police were informed had been in appellant\u2019s possession. Appellant never suggested that he might want to confess until the major said \u201cyou look kind of down in the dumps; do you want to talk ... if you want to talk, talk.\u201d This certainly was not an innocent attempt on the part of the mayor to strike up a friendly conversation to help appellant pass the time until the police returned from their search. There is no difference for constitutional purposes between questioning an accused outright and more subtly suggesting that he incriminate himself without being asked specific questions. Had appellant been asked \u201cdid you do it?\u201d Miranda warnings would be necessary. There is no reason why they should not also be required where the question is \u201cwill you talk?\u201d Talk about what? The implication clearly was that appellant had committed the crime and would feel better if he confessed. In our view, any question likely to or expected to elicit a confession constitutes \u201cinterrogation\u201d under Miranda. The question here was clearly of this type, and thus we believe that appellant is entitled to a new trial.\nWe thus conclude that appellant\u2019s confession was admitted in violation of Miranda,. In light of this decision, we need not pass on appellant\u2019s other contentions.\nThe judgment of the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Cambria County is reversed and a new trial is granted.\nMr. Justice Musmanno did not participate in the decision of this case.\nThe appellants in Vanderpool, Fperjesi and Feldman were not \u201cin custody\u201d or deprived of their freedom of action in any significant way at the time appellants made the statements. In the case at bar, appellant was \u201cin custody\u201d when he made the statement.\nEven where an accused blurts out a confession, Miranda warnings at least should be necessary before any questions are asked that do anything more than clarify statements already made. See Institute of Continuing Legal Education, \u201cCriminal Law and the Constitution \u2014 Sources and Commentaries\u201d 354 (1968). Court of a conviction based, in part on unconstitutional evidence leaves the State free to retry the defendant without the tainted evidence.\u201d 394 U.S. at 327 n.4, 37 L.W. at 4261 n.4.\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has recently indicated that it will not allow the prosecution to draw fine lines in order to deny prisoners the rights guaranteed by Miranda. In Orozco v. Texas, 394 U.S. 324, 27 L.W. 4260 (1969), the Court rejected the argument that because a suspect was interrogated in his own room, not in the station house, he was not entitled to Miranda warnings, holding that although a suspect is likely to be under increased pressure when questioned in the station house, this is not essential to his right to not make self-incriminatory statements. likewise here, although appellant may have felt more secure with the apparently friendly questioning by the mayor than he would have were he undergoing formal police interrogation, the fact that the confession was elicited in this manner does not take this case without the scope of Miranda. In either event \u2014 just as in Orozco \u2014 the aim of the questioning was to gain incriminating information, and this is what triggers the need for Miranda warnings.\nOrozco is relevant also for the caveat that the Court included, which applies equally to the case before us: \u201ca reversal by this"}
