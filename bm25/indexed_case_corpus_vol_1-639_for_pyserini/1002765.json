{"id": "1002765", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe learned judge below found as a fact that the option was accepted on July 8, by the proper parties, and that the renewed acceptance and tender of money on July 10 were for greater caution only.\nEither notice of acceptance was sufficient. It was not required to be in writing and the manifest meaning and understanding of the parties in the words \u201c the party of the second part shall have until the 10th day of July to accept\u201d were that they should have that day. The findings of the judge were upon sufficient evidence and his conclusions therefrom were correct.\nDecree affirmed."}
