{"id": "842359", "contents": "Lockhart\u2019s Appeals.\nPer Curiam,\nThe appellant has entered two appeals. In No. 251, Oct. T., 1892, he appeals as administrator of Maria J. Lockhart, his deceased wife, from the decree of the orphans\u2019 court, distributing a fund in the hands of James T. Gormley, executor of the last will and testament of James Gormley, deceased. In No. 250, Oct T., 1892, he appeals as administrator of Mary E. Lockhart, his deceased daughter, from the same decree.\nThe facts involved in these appeals, and the law bearing upon them, have been so clearly stated by the learned judge of the orphans\u2019 court, that any further discussion of them is unnecessary.\nThe decree is affirmed in each case, and the appeals dismissed at the costs of the appellant.\nGormley\u2019s Appeal.\nPer Curiam,\nThis is an appeal from the same decree as that in Lockhart\u2019s appeals, just decided. The only error specified is, that the court below made distribution to Mrs. Anna B. Wettengell, subject to the trusts and limitations contained in the eighth clause of the will, without requiring security.\nThe appeal does not appear to have been taken in any 'Spirit of controversy, but mainly for the protection of the executor. He appears to have been under the impression that the decree of the orphans\u2019 court was no protection. In this we think he was mistaken: See Stewart\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 149, and Charlton\u2019s Appeal, 88 Id. 476. Be that as it may, the learned judge of the orphans\u2019 court has given sufficient reasons for not requiring security.\nThe decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
