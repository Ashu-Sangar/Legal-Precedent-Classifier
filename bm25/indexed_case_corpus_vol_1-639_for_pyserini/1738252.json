{"id": "1738252", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nOn July 7, 1973, this Court, upon appellant\u2019s appeal from dismissal of his Post Conviction Hearing Act petition, remanded the case to the PCHA court to determine whether appellant was indigent and, if so, whether his election to forego assistance of counsel in the PCHA proceedings was knowing and intelligent. Commonwealth v. Conner, 462 Pa. 278, 341 A.2d 79 (1975). The PCHA court determined appellant was indigent and knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel. From this decision, appellant now appeals.\nThe record does not support the conclusion that appellant\u2019s waiver of the constitutionally protected right to counsel was knowing and intelligent. See Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). Accordingly, we vacate the order of the PCHA court denying appellant\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief and remand the case to that court to appoint counsel other than a public defender to represent appellant and to allow amendment of appellant\u2019s pro se PCHA petition.\nOrder vacated and case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nWe hear this appeal pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965), 1580, \u00a7 11, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-11 (Supp.1977), and the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp.1977)."}
