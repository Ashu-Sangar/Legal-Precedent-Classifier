{"id": "1163709", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nUpon the trial of this action of trespass to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by the minor plaintiff, the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendant. The testimony developed a clear question of fact as to defendant\u2019s negligence which was submitted to the jury in a charge which we find to be free from reversible error. A careful examination of the record discloses no ground for disturbing the verdict.\nThe judgment and order of the court below, refusing plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial, is affirmed."}
