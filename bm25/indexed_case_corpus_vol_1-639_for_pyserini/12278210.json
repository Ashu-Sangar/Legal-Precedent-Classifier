{"id": "12278210", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM\nAND NOW, this 19th day of September, 2016, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED, limited to Petitioner\u2019s first issue. The order of the Superior Court is VACATED, as issues neither raised nor preserved for appellate review are waived and may not constitute the basis for reversal of a trial court\u2019s decision. See, e.g., Wiegand v. Wiegand, 461 Pa. 482, 337 A.2d 256 (1975). The case is REMANDED to the Superior Court for determination based upon full consideration of the issues raised and preserved for appeal by Respondent."}
