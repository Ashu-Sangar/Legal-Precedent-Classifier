{"id": "900257", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Cheek Justice Sterrett,\nWhen this case was here before (17G Pa. 262) the judgment in plaintiff\u2019s .favor was reversed on the ground that the jury, in a special verdict, found that the note in suit was given \u201cfor the purpose of hindering and delaying creditors of said Scanlon, and that there was no evidence on the part of the plaintiff to show that said note was given without any consideration or for the purpose of hindering and delaying creditors.\u201d Our Brother Mitchell, writing for the Court in that case, said: \u201c The result is that the plaintiff has a judgment on a ground that he expressly repudiated, and in the face of an explicit finding by the jury against his claim, while the defendant has a judgment against her, notwithstanding a finding of the main fact of the defense in her favor. ... It is clearly apparent that the transactions between the parties were not the ordinary dealings of borrower and lender, and it is equally manifest that the witnesses on neither side were telling the entire truth.\u201d\nOn the second trial, the record of which is now here for review, the defendant testified more fully as to declarations by the plaintiff to the effect that there was no money consideration for the note, that he did not intend to try to collect any money on it, and that he repeatedly promised to give it to her. Her testimony as to these declarations was corroborated by other witnesses. Other facts and circumstances, \u2014 not necessary to be detailed here, \u2014 gave further weight to her testimony. The ease was clearly one for the jury. There was no error in refusing to strike out the defendant\u2019s testimony as to plaintiff\u2019s declarations ; nor is there any ground for plaintiff\u2019s contention that binding instructions should have been given in his favor. Such instructions would have been plain error. It necessarily follows that the portions of the charge embraced in the second and third specifications are not erroneous. The complaint is not that the trial judge presented plaintiff\u2019s case inadequately or gave undue prominence to the defendant\u2019s theory, but that the defense was permitted to go to the jury in any form. In commenting on the testimony as to plaintiff\u2019s declarations, the learned trial judge, after presenting defendant\u2019s theory, was careful to state that there was \u201c a possible construction to be given to this testimony that would still be favorable to a recovery by the plaintiff,\u201d namely, that the declarations might have been made, \u201c for the purpose of endeavoring to dispel the evident worry that Mrs. Scanlon was in.\u201d That was going quite as far in presenting a view favorable to the plaintiff as the latter could reasonably expect. The plaintiff\u2019s complaints (if any he has) ought to be against the jury, and not the court. In saying this, however, we do not mean to intimate that the jury reached an improper conclusion. On the contrary, we think it was correct.\nThe objection to plaintiff\u2019s second point is that it wholly ignores defendant\u2019s theory of the case and the evidence in support of it. The defense did not allege payment or cancelation, but contended that the note had been given for some undisclosed purpose, and that the purpose, whatever it was, had been fulfilled. The trial judge was therefore right in embodying in his answer the remark that plaintiff could recover unless the defendant showed one of the defenses to the note presented in the point, or \u201c that the purpose for which it was given had been fulfilled.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s last point was properly qualified.\nIt is unnecessary to pursue the inquiry further. Our examination of the record has failed to disclose any error on the part of the court below that would justify a reversal of the judgment.\nJudgment affirmed."}
