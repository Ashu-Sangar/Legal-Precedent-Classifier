{"id": "582186", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eoberts,\nIn October of 1966, a jury found appellant guilty of the crimes of murder in the first degree and rape. A sentence of life imprisonment was imposed. On appeal, this Court reversed the judgment of sentence and granted a new trial because appellant\u2019s rights, as mandated by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966), were violated. Commonwealth v. Yount, 435 Pa. 276, 256 A.2d 464 (1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 925, 90 S. Ct. 918 (1970).\nOn retrial in November, 1970, a jury again found appellant guilty of murder in the first degree, and the penalty was again fixed at life imprisonment. Post-trial motions were denied and this direct appeal followed. We now affirm.\nOn April 28, 1966, the body of Pamela Sue Eimer, an eighteen year-old high school student, was discovered in a wooded area near her home in Luthersburg, Pennsylvania. One of her stockings was knotted and tied around her neck. An autopsy revealed that death was caused by strangulation. Further examination disclosed three slashes across the victim\u2019s throat and cuts of the fingers of her left hand, inflicted by a sharp instrument, and numerous wounds about her head, caused by a blunt instrument.\nAt approximately 5:45 a.m. on the morning of April 29, 1966, appellant, a teacher at the school the deceased had attended, voluntarily appeared at the state police substation in DuBois, Pennsylvania, and rang the doorbell. An officer opened the door and asked whether he could be of assistance. Appellant stated, \u201cI am the man you are looking for.\u201d The officer asked whether he was referring to the \u201cincident in Luthersburg,\u201d and appellant responded in the affirmative.\nThe officer then asked appellant to come into the police station and be seated. Leaving appellant unattended, the officer proceeded to a back bedroom where a detective and another police officer were sleeping, Avoke them, and informed them that \u201cthere was a man in the front that said Ave are looking for him.\u201d He then returned to the front office where appellant, who had removed his coat, hat, and gloves, identified himself as Jon Yount.\nAfter dressing, the detective and the second officer entered the front office. The detective was told by the first officer that appellant\u2019s name was Jon Yount. The detective then asked appellant to be seated inside a smaller office adjacent to the front office, where he asked, \u201cWhy are we looking for you?\u201d Appellant replied, \u201cI killed that girl.\u201d Upon hearing that answer, the detective inquired, \u201cWhat girl?\u201d, and appellant responded, \u201cPamela Rimer.\u201d\nIn response to the detective\u2019s next question, \u201cHow did you kill this girl?\u201d, appellant answered, \u201cI hit her with a wrench and I choked her.\u201d At that point the detective gave appellant admittedly inadequate Miranda warnings, and began interrogation as to the details of the crime. A -written, confession was subsequently obtained.\nPrior to appellant\u2019s second trial, the question \u201cHow did you Mil this girl?\u201d and its answer, as well as the written confession were suppressed, on the authority of our prior decision, Commonwealth v. Yount, supra, as violative of Miranda. The admissibility of appellant\u2019s initial statements that the police were looMng for him in connection with the Luthersburg incident is not challenged, nor could a challenge be successful. See Commonwealth v. Miller, 448 Pa. 114, 121 n.2, 290 A.2d 62, 65 n.2 (1972).\nAppellant does contend, however, that the court erred in not suppressing his statement, \u201cI ldlled that girl,\u201d and Ms identification of the victim as \u201cPamela Rimer.\u201d It is argued that these two admissions were the product of \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d and therefore should have been preceded by Miranda warmngs. Appellant argues that warnings were required before the question \u201cWhy are we looking for you?\u201d was asked.\nWe are asked to determine the precise time when the need for Miranda warnings arose. It is now beyond question that \u201c \u2018whenever an individual is questioned while in custody or while the object of an investigation of wMch he is the focus, before any questioning begins the individual must be given the warnings established in Miranda. . . .\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. D\u2019Nicuola, 448 Pa. 54, 57, 292 A.2d 333, 335 (1972) (quoting Commonwealth v. Feldman, 432 Pa. 428, 432, 248 A.2d 1, 3 (1968)). Accord, Commonwealth v. Simula, 434 Pa. 219, 225, 252 A.2d 575, 578 (1969); see Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 445 Pa. 292, 285 A.2d 172 (1971).\nIt is, however, only that questioning which is interrogation initiated by law enforcement officers which calls for Miranda warnings. Miranda v. Arizona, supra at 444, 86 S. Ct. at 1612. As this Court held in Commonwealth v. Simala, supra at 226, 252 A.2d at 578: \u201c\u2018[I]t is not simply custody plus \u201cquestioning,\u201d as such, which calls for the Miranda safeguards but custody plus police conduct . . . calculated to, expected to, or likely to, evoke admissions.\u2019 \u201d The rationale behind this holding is found in Miranda, where the Court stated: \u201cConfessions remain a proper element in law enforcement. . . . The fundamental import of the privilege ... is not whether [an individual] is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be interrogated. There is no requirement that the police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime .... Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment . . . .\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, supra at 478, 86 S. Ct. at 1630 (emphasis added).\nClearly, \u201cany question likely to or expected to elicit a confession constitutes Interrogation\u2019 under Miranda. . . .\u201d Commonwealth v. Simala, supra at 227, 252 A.2d at 579. Accord, Commonwealth v. Mercier, 451 Pa. 211, 214, 302 A.2d 337, 339 (1973). But \"[a]ny statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, supra at 478, 86 S. Ct. at 1630.\nOn this record it cannot be said that the two police inquiries here challenged constitute conduct calculated to, expected to, or likely to elicit an incriminating response, or that they were asked with an intent to extract or an expectation of eliciting an incriminating statement. All this record establishes is that the detective knew only that a man named Jon Yount\u2014a name which the detective had never heard before\u2014voluntarily came to the police station early in the morning and volunteered that the police were looking for him. In response to this information, the detective extemporaneously asked, \u201cWhy are we looking for you?\u201d Appellant was not coerced, prompted, or urged to incriminate himself. To the contrary, the detective\u2019s inquiry, made in response to information volunteered by appellant, was of a neutral character and not interrogative.\nAppellant\u2019s answer, \u201cI killed that girl,\u201d was given freely and without compelling influence. It was therefore volunteered in the constitutional sense. That the answer was in fact incriminating does not alter its volunteered character nor preclude its use. Miranda v. Arizona, supra at 478, 86 S. Ct. at 1630.\nSimilarly, we are of the opinion that the statement identifying \u201cthat girl\u201d as \u201cPamela Rimer\u201d was volunteered. Appellant, without any compulsion, went to the substation and volunteered that he had killed \u201cthat girl.\u201d As we indicated in Commonwealth v. Simala, supra at 226 n.2, 252 A.2d at 579 n.2, after an incriminating, but ambiguous, statement is volunteered, as was done here, a question which does not do \u201canything more than clarify statements already made,\u201d in the absence of any coercion or prompting, subtle or overt, is permissible. See also Kamisar, \u201c \u2018Custodial Interrogation\u2019 Within the Meaning of Mwanda,\u201d in Institute of Continuing Legal Education, Criminal Law and the Constitution\u2014Sources and Commentaries 335, 354 (1968).\nHere, immediately upon hearing appellant\u2019s volunteered statement, \u201cI killed that girl,\u201d the detective spontaneously asked, \u201cWhat girl?\u201d By this he sought only to clarify appellant\u2019s prior statement. Appellant responded, \u201cPamela Rimer.\u201d Such a clarifying inquiry, made in response to a statement volunteered by appellant during an interview which he initiated, is proper. The identification must be deemed constitutionally volunteered. Accord, State v. Perry, 14 Ohio St. 2d 256, 237 N.E.2d 891 (1968); People v. Mercer, 257 Cal. App. 2d 244, 64 Cal. Rptr. 861 (1967); see Hicks v. United States, 382 F.2d 158 (D.C. Cir. 1967).\nAs already indicated, appellant volunteered both that he had killed someone and the victim\u2019s identity. Because \u201c [v] olunteered statements . . . are not barred by the Fifth Amendment,\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, supra at 478, 86 S. Ct. at 1630, their use as evidence was constitutionally permissible.\nHowever, after these statements were given, Miranda warnings became necessary. Commonwealth v. Yount, supra at 280, 256 A.2d at 465; see Commonwealth v. Feldman, 432 Pa. 428, 248 A.2d 1 (1968); Commonwealth v. Jefferson, 423 Pa. 541, 226 A.2d 765 (1967). Appellant\u2019s initial admission and identification created the critical moment after which interrogation without Miranda warnings was impermissible. It was the absence of warnings at that moment, and not before, that required our prior reversal. The earlier, volunteered statements, however, were not the product of interrogation initiated by the police.\nOn this record, therefore, it must be concluded that the Commonwealth satisfied its burden of proving by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the two statements here challenged were constitutionally permissible evidence. Commonwealth v. Ravenell, 448 Pa. 162, 292 A.2d 365 (1972); Pa. R. Crim. P. 323(h).\nAppellant raises ten additional assignments of error. These need be discussed only briefly.\nAppellant contends that the trial court erred in refusing his timely motions for a change of venue, and advances three arguments in support of this position.\nFirst, it is asserted that excessive pretrial publicity prevented a fair trial. In responding to this argument, the trial court observed: \u201cThe first of the trials occurred in 1966, and as pointed out herein, the second one occurred in 1970. As the record will indicate there was practically no publicity given to this matter through the news media in the meanwhile except to report that a new trial had been granted by the Supreme Court. It is to be noted also that throughout the second trial there was practically no public interest shown in the trial; one thing to be noted is that on some days there being practically no persons present even to listen to it. . . .\u201d These findings, fully supported by the record, do not sustain appellant\u2019s claim, and the court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion for a change of venue predicated on this theory. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 451 Pa. 190, 303 A.2d 209, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 878, 94 S. Ct. 164 (1973); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 440 Pa. 342, 269 A.2d 752 (1970).\nSecond, appellant contends that the excusing of a large number of veniremen for cause, and the nature of the answers of those so excused, conclusively demonstrated substantial community bias and prejudice which required a change of venue. Nothing in this record, however, refutes the court\u2019s assertion that it liberally granted appellant\u2019s challenges for cause \u201cto assure that there could be no complaint about the final jury empanelled.\u201d Neither does the voir dire, as appellant argues, reveal a \u201cclear and convincing\u201d build-up of prejudice or a \u201c \u2018pattern of deep and bitter prejudice\u2019 shown . . . throughout the community\u201d which would require a change of venue. Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 725, 727, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 1644, 1645 (1961). See Commonwealth v. Hoss, 445 Pa. 98, 103-07, 283 A.2d 58, 61-63 (1971); Commonwealth v. Swanson, 432 Pa. 293, 248 A.2d 12 (1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 949, 89 S. Ct. 1287 (1969).\nThird, it is argued that the Act of March 18, 1875, P.L. 30, \u00a7 1, 19 P.S. \u00a7 551 (1964), mandated a change of venue. This Act states, inter alia:\n\u201cIn criminal prosecutions the venue may be changed, on application of the defendant . . . U\n\u201c. . . When, upon second trial of any felonious homicide, the evidence on the former trial thereof shall have been published within the county in which the same is being tried, and the regular panel of jurors shall be exhausted without obtaining a jury.\u201d\nThe Act, however, by its own terms, is directed to the sound discretion of the trial court. As this Court established in Commonwealth v. Karmendi, 328 Pa. 321, 337-38, 195 A. 62, 69 (1937) : \u201cThe act is not mandatory; it lies within the sound discretion of the court below: Com. v. Cleary, 148 Pa. 26, but in a particularly notorious case in a given community, this court will review that discretion, and if in its judgment it is felt the accused could not help but be prejudiced in her subsequent trial by the feeling engendered, a new trial will be granted. . . .\u201d See also Commonwealth v. Sacarakis, 196 Pa. Superior Ct. 455, 175 A.2d 127 (1961). Although the regular panel of jurors was in fact exhausted before the jury was selected, this circumstance alone obviously does not require a change of venue. It cannot be said that the court abused its discretion where, as here, the record fails to disclose undue community prejudice.\nSimilarly, we reject appellant\u2019s argument that, during voir dire, the court erred in denying certain challenges for cause. Our reading of the testimony of the challenged jurors satisfies us that the trial court correctly concluded that \u201ceven where a juror may have had any opinion in the matter, the jury was without prejudice and was able to and did arrive at its verdict on the testimony and the law involved.\u201d The record shows that none of the jurors had a fixed opinion as to appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence, or was otherwise legally unable to serve. See Commonwealth v. Hoss, supra at 107, 283 A.2d at 63-64; Commonwealth v. Swanson, supra at 299, 248 A.2d at 15; Commonwealth v. McCrew, 375 Pa. 518, 525, 100 A.2d 467, 470 (1953).\nAppellant also argues that all evidence seized during a search of his automobile should have been suppressed. He asserts that the search warrant relied upon by the police was issued without probable cause.\nBefore the time appellant appeared at the DuBois substation, another state policeman, working entirely separately and in a location different from the station to which appellant went, received from two witnesses a description of an automobile they had seen near where the victim\u2019s body was found. The witnesses reported that, at about the time the murder was committed, the automobile passed their home headed toward the scene, and that later it passed from the opposite direction travelling at high speed. That policeman, working only from this information, learned that one Jon Yount owned an automobile fitting the description.\nAfter appellant admitted that he had killed Pamela liimer, one of the officers at the substation reported that fact to the main police barracks. This collective knowledge, properly before the magistrate, constituted the requisite probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant. See Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584 (1969); Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509 (1964); Commonwealth v. Hall, 451 Pa. 201, 302 A.2d 342 (1973); Commonwealth v. D\u2019Angelo, 437 Pa. 331, 263 A. 2d 441 (1970). Since appellant\u2019s admission was not tainted we agree with the trial court that the subsequent search was not impermissible as the \u201cfruit of a poisonous tree.\u201d Commonwealth v. Marabel, 445 Pa. 435, 444, 283 A.2d 285, 289 (1971); see Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 88 S. Ct. 407 (1963).\nAppellant contends that a pocketknife found on his person when he was arrested was improperly admitted into evidence. As previously noted, the victim suffered cuts of the neck and fingers, and appellant was arrested about twelve hours after the commission of the crime. The knife was of a kind that could have inflicted the wounds, even though the prosecution was unable conclusively to demonstrate that the particular knife was the weapon used. Its relevance cannot be successfully challenged. \u201cThe fact that the accused had a weapon or implement suitable to the commission of the crime charged, such as a knife ... is always a proper ingredient of the case for the prosecution.\u201d 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 157 at 289-90 (13th ed. C. Torcia 1972).\nThis relevant evidence clearly was admissible. As this Court recently held in Commonwealth v. Ford, 451 Pa. 81, 84, 301 A.2d 856, 857 (1973) : \u201c[Positive testimony that the knife in question was actually the murder weapon is not required prior to introduction into evidence. ... If a proper foundation for the admission of the evidence has been laid, as here, then admission into evidence is permissible. . . . The fact that the knife could not be positively identified affects the weight of such evidence, but not its admissibility. . . .\u201d\nHere, not only was the knife a possible murder implement, but it was found upon the person of the appellant at a time \u201creasonably proximate to the commission of the crime.\u201d 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 211 at 442 (13th ed. C. Torcia 1972). A foundation sufficient to support the admission of the knife was laid. Its evidentiary use was therefore a proper element in the prosecution\u2019s case.\nAppellant assigns as error the admission of certain photographs of decedent and several items of her clothing, including the knotted stocking which was one of the murder weapons. It is well-settled law in this Commonwealth that \u201cthe admission of photographs exhibiting the body of a deceased in homicide cases is primarily within the discretion of the trial judge. . . .\u201d Commonwealth v. Powell, 428 Pa. 275, 278, 241 A.2d 119, 121 (1968). Moreover, this Court has repeatedly declared that \u201cthe proper test to be applied by a trial court in determining the admissibility of photographs in homicide cases is whether or not the photographs are of such essential evidentiary value that their need clearly outweighs the likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jurors. . . .\u201d Id. at 278-79, 241 A.2d at 121. Accord, Commonwealth v. Ford, supra at 86, 301 A.2d at 858; Commonwealth v. Eckhart, 430 Pa. 311, 317, 242 A.2d 271, 274 (1968). This test is also applicable to the other demonstrative evidence, i.e., the clothing, admitted here. See Commonwealth v. Ford, supra at 85, 301 A.2d at 857-58.\nIt is to be noted that the stocking was one of the murder implements. The paramount evidentiary need for this item is obvious. As to the other challenged items, the court found, and we agree that \u201c [t] he photographs aided in the jurys\u2019 [sic] understanding of the type of injuries inflicted, where and how the deceased was found, the site and position of the deceased, and in very definite corroboration of the oral testimony of witnesses. . . .\u201d Moreover, the court stated that \u201cthe photographs were [not] at all inflamatory[sic],\u201d and there is no suggestion that the victim was, for example, pictured naked, or that the photographs or items of clothing were gruesome or grotesque. On this record, we hold that the court correctly applied the Powell test, that the evidentiary value of the admitted evidence outweighed any potential for prejudice, and that the court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged items.\nAppellant also argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sequester the Commonwealth witnesses, particularly the state police officers. This Court has previously held that \u201cthe question of sequestration of witnesses is left largely to the discretion of the trial Judge and his decision thereon will be reversed only for a clear abuse of discretion.\u201d Commonwealth v. Kravitz, 400 Pa. 198, 218, 161 A. 2d 861, 870 (1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 846, 81 S. Ct. 807 (1961); see Pa. R Crim. P. 326.\nIn its opinion, the court justified its denial of the motion, by explaining that \u201cno witness was called who had not previously testified at the first trial; and examination of all the testimony will indicate that it was much as was given at the first trial of this case.\u201d These witnesses were not sequestered at the first trial. The record also establishes that the same police officers who testified at trial also testified a few weeks earlier at the suppression hearing. No request to sequester was then made. We find the court\u2019s reasons for refusing to sequester the officers convincing, and find no abuse of discretion.\nIt is also argued that the trial court variously erred in its instructions to the jury. Only one of these now-asserted challenges, however, was properly raised by specific objection before the jury retired to deliberate. That objection alone can now be reviewed. Common wealth v. Watlington, 452 Pa. 524, 306 A.2d 892 (1973); Pa. E. Crim. P. 1119(b). The objection is to an allegedly improper expression of the court\u2019s opinion that the evidence did not warrant a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.\nThe trial court expressed the view that if the jury found that appellant did in. fact maliciously kill decedent, the court recalled no evidence of extenuating circumstances which would reduce the act to voluntary manslaughter. The court, however, also gave the jurors a full, complete, adequate, and correct charge on voluntary manslaughter, and instructed them that voluntary manslaughter was an entirely permissible verdict. The trial judge also specifically instructed the jurors that their recollection of the testimony, and not his, controlled, that his opinion was no more than a gratuitous observation, and that the jury could and should return any verdict it felt justified. Moreover, the court did not express an opinion as to guilt or innocence or suggest that the jury return any particular verdict. The charge, read in its entirety, removed nothing from the province of the jury nor did it contain any judicial expression of guilt. The charge therefore was proper. Commonwealth v. Archambault, 448 Pa. 90, 290 A.2d 72 (1972) ; Commonwealth v. Motley, 448 Pa. 110, 289 A.2d 724 (1972); see Commonwealth v. Miller, 448 Pa. 114, 124-26, 290 A.2d 62, 67-68 (1972).\nAppellant complains that the court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based on allegedly inflammatory and prejudicial remarks by the prosecutor in his closing argument. We are satisfied, as was the trial court, that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were limited to the facts in evidence and the legitimate inferences therefrom, and consequently cannot be deemed improper. See Commonwealth v. Goosby, 450 Pa. 609, 301 A.2d 673 (1973); ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function \u00a7 5.8 (Approved Draft, 1971).\nFinally, appellant contends that if the oral admission, the pocketknife, the clothing and photographs, and the items seized from appellant\u2019s automobile were improperly before the jury, then the remaining evidence could not sustain any verdict of guilty. Since we have determined that those items of evidence were properly admitted, this challenge must fail. Reviewing all the record evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we are satisfied that the jury reasonably could have found, beyond a reasonable doubt, all the elements of murder in the first degree, and that the evidence therefore is sufficient to sustain the verdict. Commonwealth v. Lee, 450 Pa. 152, 154, 299 A.2d 640, 641 (1973).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nMr. Justice Pomeroy concurs in the result.\nAppellant\u2019s motion to quash the indictment for rape was granted. and the second trial was for the crime of murder alone.\nJurisdiction attaches by virtue of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp. 1973).\nIn our prior decision, a new trial was granted because tbe written confession admitted into evidence was not preceded by warnings satisfying Miranda. Tbe question of tbe admissibility of tbe two statements bere challenged, not being necessary to our earlier decision, was not there decided.\nIn light of our determination that appellant\u2019s statements were volunteered, we need not determine, as the Oommonwealth argues, whether appellant was then in \u201ccustody.\u201d See Commonwealth v. Marabel, 445 Pa. 435, 283 A.2d 285 (1971).\nIndeed, the exhaustion of the initial array is not an unusual occurrence. As Dean Daub observed: \u201cIt sometimes happens that there are so many disqualified or excused jurors that the array is not large enough to permit the completion of a particular civil or criminal panel. This extraordinary situation is frequently encountered during the selection of a panel in murder cases. In that type of case the large number of peremptory challenges allowed to each side, and the liberal allowance of causal challenges frequently exhausts the array or reduces it to the point where the trial cannot proceed until additional jurors have been summoned.\u201d 1 B. Daub, Pennsylvania Trial Guide \u00a7 34.4 at 81 (1959).\nSee also ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Trial by Jury \u00a7 2.5 (Approved Draft, 1968). The Commentary to that section suggests:\n\u201cA challenge for cause to an individual juror may be made only on the ground:\n\u201c(j) That the juror has a state of mind in reference to the cause or to the defendant or to the person alleged to have been injured by the offense charged, or to the person on whose complaint the prosecution was instituted, which will prevent him from acting with impartiality; but the formation of an opinion or impression regarding the guilt or innocence of the defendant shall not of itself be sufficient ground of challenge to a juror, if he declares, and the court is satisfied, that he can render an impartial verdict according to the evidence.\u201d Id. 68-69.\nFor purposes of establishing probable cause, the officer who obtained the warrant was entitled to rely on the information communicated to him from the DuBois substation. United States v. Stratton, 453 F.2d 36, 37-38 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 1069, 92 S. Ct. 1515 (1972).\nSee also 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 211 at 441-42 (13th ed. C. Torcia 1972) (footnotes omitted) :\n\u201cIt is relevant to show that the defendant owned or had access to an implement with which the crime could have been committed.\nThe possession by the defendant of a weapon or implement of crime is relevant even though there is no evidence that it was used in the commission of any particular crime, but there must be evidence that some crime was committed.\nThe possession or ownership of the weapon or implement of crime must be reasonably proximate to the commission of the crime. If too great a period has elapsed between the commission of the crime and the period of possession or ownership, the evidence would be too remote and hence inadmissible. Thus, in a prosecution for assault with intent to kill, the admission in evidence of the finding of a weapon on the person of the accused when he was arrested nearly a month after the assault, was prejudicial error.\u201d\nAppellant also contends that lie was entitled to an instruction that the knife had no evidentiary value. Because the knife was correctly admitted, appellant\u2019s point for charge was properly refused.\nWe also note that the court in its discretion did not allow these allegedly inflammatory items into the jury room.\nAppellant also argues that the court overemphasized the crime of murder in the first degree, and that it did not, while reviewing the evidence, sufficiently stress the jury\u2019s role as factfinder.\nIt is contended that the prosecutor improperly commented on the gravity of the crime charged, that the inferences he drew from the evidence tended toward the speculative, and that he improperly defended, after appellant had attacked, the competence of the state police."}
