{"id": "1908565", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nThe appellants, Fred B. Lafferty, J. D. Lafferty and Charles W. Albright, Jr., partners, d/b/a Lafferty Trucking Company (Lafferty), by this appeal challenge the correctness of the judgment entered below following dismissal of their appeal from a decision of the Commonwealth\u2019s Board of Finance and Revenue sustaining an assessment for a use tax deficiency.\nThe sole question for decision is whether a contract carrier (Lafferty), which is not a public utility, but which renders a service identical to that rendered by a common carrier, which is a public utility, is entitled to the exclusion from taxation afforded to those engaged in a \u201cpublic utility service\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a72(j) (7) (c) and 2(n) (4) (c) (iii) of the Selective Sales and Use Tax Act.\nLafferty contends it is entitled to the exclusion. The facts were stipulated below. Lafferty conducts a business of contract carrier by motor vehicle in both interstate and intrastate commerce under rights granted to it by the Interstate Commerce Commission and Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission. Lafferty serves only one customer, a retail food chain (A. & P.) for which it transports goods and merchandise.\nThe first argument advanced by Lafferty is that the definitional exclusion for \u201cpublic utility service\u201d facilities, supra, is not limited by the definition of \u201cpublic utility\u201d in the Public Utility Code, so that one need not be a \u201cpublic utility\u201d in order for one\u2019s services to be excluded. However, it admits the term \u201cservice\u201d is defined by reference to the Public Utility Code. This rather ingenious argument rests on two fairly recent decisions of this Court: Commonwealth v. McHugh, 406 Pa. 566, 178 A. 2d 556 (1962), and Commonwealth v. Equitable Gas Company, 415 Pa. 118, 202 A. 2d 11 (1964).\nIn- McHugh, a construction contractor sought the public utility exclusion on its purchase of materials and supplies used in the erection of a facility for the municipal water department of the City of Philadelphia. The issue in McHugh was whether the exclusion, admittedly applicable to the repairing and' renovation of existing public utility facilities, also extended to- purchases utilized in the erection of new facilities. We held the exclusion did so extend.\nIn the Equitable Gas Company case, the question was whether or not tangible property of two public utilities was used directly in rendering a \u201cservice,\u201d so - as to \u25a0 qualify for the public utility service exclusion. .We held that, in determining whether or not an \u201cexcluded\u201d service was being rendered by a public utility, one must refer to the definition of \u201cservice\u201d in the Public Utility Code.\nLafferty uses these two decisions to construct a syllogism which would enable it to claim the public utility service use tax exclusion, even though it is not \u00e1 \u201cpublic' utility\u201d as that term is defined by the Public .Utility Code. The premises involved in this syllogism are-as follows: (-1) The Equitable Gas Company case, supra, held \u201cservice\u201d) as defined by the Public Utility Code, to control in the meaning of that word as contained in the exclusion in question. The code definition of \u201cservice\u201d includes transportation by contract carrier. (2) The McHugh case, supra, held the exclusion applied in the case of materials purchased for the construction of new facilities for the Philadelphia Water Department. Lafferty points out that the Philadelphia Water Department is not a \u201cpublic utility\u201d as that term is defined in the Public Utility Code because it is municipally operated.\nTherefore, claims Lafferty, \u201cpublic utility service\u201d as used in the exclusion cannot mean \u201cservice rendered by a public utility.\u201d Rather, it actually means something like \u201cservice similar to that which a public utility renders.\u201d \u201cService\u201d is defined by reference to the Public Utility Code (Equitable Gas Company, supra) under which definition Lafferty qualifies. \u201cPublic utility\u201d would not be defined by reference to the Public Utility Code, of course, because the McHugh case, supra, granted the exclusion to an entity not qualifying as a Public Utility Code \u201cpublic utility.\u201d The \u201cpublic utility\u201d facet of the exclusionary phrasing is claimed to be a general modifier only, inserted to limit the provision to any entity which performs services identical to those rendered by genuine, bona fide public utilities. Presumably, \u201cpublic utility\u201d would also be needed to direct anyone reading the statute to the Public Utility Code definition of \u201cservices\u201d. Since Lafferty performs services which can be equated with those of a genuine public utility, i.e., a common carrier, it asserts that it is encompassed within the ambit of the exclusionary clause.\nWhile we admire both the ingenuity and the originality of this argument, we do not accept it. Under close analysis, the premises upon which it depends break down on several counts.\nThe McHugh decision reasoning by Lafferty is based on the assumption that this Court in McHugh recognized and proceeded on the ground that the Philadelphia Water Department was not a Public Utility Code \u201cpublic utility\u201d. In fact, we made no such assumption. The only issue raised before us in that case was whether the tax exclusion applied to the construction of new facilities, as well as to the improvement of existing facilities. It was assumed, or tacitly conceded, in every one of the six briefs filed by the various parties and amici curiae in that case, as well as by this Court speaking through the present writer, that the Philadelphia Water Department was a bona fide public utility. This \u201cgiven\u201d was an integral part of the McHugh decision. The correctness of this concession by the Court and the Commonwealth, as well as the other parties, is presently irrelevant.\nTurning now to the Equitable Gas Company branch of Lafferty\u2019s argument, we see that in that case the taxpayers were admittedly genuine public utilities. The sole \u25a0 question was whether or not certain tangible property (meters) was used by the admitted public utilities in rendering a \u201cservice.\u201d The whole em: phasis of our opinion in Equitable Gas Company was devoted to the question of whether or not the use of meters by a public utility constituted the rendering of a \u201cservice\u201d by that public utility.\nA careful reading of Equitable Gas Company clearly manifests that we proceeded to an analysis of the \u201cservice\u201d question only after an initial determination that the entities involved were genuine public utilities. In applying the \u201cpublic utility service\u201d exclusion,, the \u201cpublic utility\u201d question should be decided before reaching the \u201cservice\u201d question. An entity must be a \u201cpublic utility\u201d under the Public Utility Code to qualify for the sales and use tax public utility service exclusion. This threshold determination was made in Equitable Gas Company and is the bedrock upon which that opinion rests.\nIt is our view, therefore, that the reading given to the Equitable Gas Company case, as well as to the McHugh case, by Lafi'erty is incomplete, and cannot serve to support the argument based thereon, that contract carriers qualify for the public service sales and use tax exclusion.\nWe feel then that the statutory exclusion in question was meant by the Legislature to apply only to Public Utility Code \u201cpublic utilities\u201d when they render Public Utility Code \u201cservices.\u201d\nLafferty next argues that the purpose of the exclusion is to prevent \u201ctax pyramiding,\u201d i.e., to insure that the sales and use tax is paid only once in the sequence from creation of the commodity or service to the consumer, to prevent a tax on a tax situation. Thus, Lafferty says that contract carriers are as much within the scope of such a purpose as common carriers. While we tend to agree with Lafferty that obviation of \u201ctax pyramiding\u201d is indeed the purpose of the instant exclusion, we cannot agree that contract carriers therefore qualify thereunder. Our prior determination interpreting the exclusion in question as being unavailable to entities not qualifying as \u201cpublic utilities\u201d under the Public Utility Code disposes of this argument. The Legislature may well have intended to block \u201ctax; pyramiding\u201d, but it likewise intended to bar contract carriers from the instant exclusion. Apparently, the Legislature felt that the effects of such \u201cpyramiding\u201d insofar as contract carriers are involved were not of such gravity to warrant the exclusion, perhaps since the scope of contract carrier service, by definition, is limited. The \u201cpurpose\u201d argument was made to bolster the syllogistic argument and when the latter fell, the former becomes, in effect, moot.\nTlie final argument advanced by Lafferty contends that Regulation 227 (which glosses the exclusion in question) is an incorrect and unconstitutional interpretation of the exclusion, because it specifically states that such is only open to Public Utility Code \u201cpublic utilities\u201d, thereby distinguishing between contract carriers and Class D common carriers. Lafferty contends that there is no difference or, at least, not enough difference between the two types of carriers to constitutionally sustain differing tax treatment.\nLafferty\u2019s argument is actually directed against the Regulation. But in view of the fact that we have today held that the essential meaning of the exclusion is accurately reflected by the Regulation, it would now be judicially unrealistic to separate a constitutional attack on the Regulation from such an attack on the statutory provision itself.\nThe question then becomes: Are contract carriers and Class D common carriers the \u201csame class of subjects\u201d? If it is reasonable to separately classify them for sales tax purposes, they are not.\nThe actual distinction made in the exclusion is between public utilities and entities which are not public utilities. It is to this broad classification that we must look in determining the reasonableness, and hence the constitutionality, of any exclusionary differentiation. If that is proper, then the exclusion of Class D common carriers is necessarily valid, such exclusion then being incidental to the larger distinction. The distinctions between a public utility and a business entity which is not a public utility are well known. For example, a public utility holds itself out to the public generally and may not refuse any legitimate demand for service, while a private business independently determines whom it will serve. 43 Am. Jur. Public Utilities and Services, \u00a72 (1942) ; 73 C.J.S. Public Utilities \u00a71 (1951). If the purpose of the exclusion indeed is to prohibit tax pyramiding, it is reasonable for the Legislature, steering a course between the need for revenue and consideration for the consumer, to deem public utility customers the most appropriate beneficiaries of the exclusionary safeguard.\nFurther, it is in the context of the whole Sales and Use Tax statute that we must view the exclusion. Since this statute is one designed to raise revenue, the state need not justify any distinction drawn between the taxed and the nontaxed \u201cso long as some other reasonable basis for treating the various classes differently exists. Where such distinction exists, the wisdom of the legislative policy of taxing one class and not another is not a matter for the courts.\u201d Commonwealth v. Life Assurance Co. of Pa., 419 Pa. 370, 377 n. 11, 214 A. 2d 209, 215 n. 11 (1965). As stated in Commonwealth v. Life Assurance Co. of Pa., Id. at 376-377, 214 A. 2d at 214: \u201cBy necessity a wide discretion must be conceded to' the Legislature in the classification of various businesses or occupations for purposes of taxation. ...\n\u201cThe only constitutional limitation placed upon the power of the Legislature to distinguish between various entities for purposes of taxation is that their basis for doing so be reasonable. . . . And the burden of showing that the classification employed by the Legislature is not reasonable is upon the party attacking the tax.\u201d (Citations omitted.)\nSince we are dealing here with two different classes, public utilities and nonpublic utilities, which are reasonably differentiated, the exclusion clause does not conflict with the uniformity clause (Art. IX \u00a71) of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The fact that some Class D common carriers look very much like contract carriers in terms of their external operations is thus accidental to the larger legislative design. Cf. Philadelphia Association of Linen Suppliers v. Philadelphia, 139 Pa. Superior Ct. 560, 567, 12 A. 2d 789, 792 (1910).\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Jones and Mr. Justice Cohen took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nThe act involved imposes a tax upon the use within the Commonwealth of tangible personal property purchased at retail. It defines \u201cuse\u201d and then further provides in \u00a72(n) (4) (c) (iii) that the term \u201cuse\u201d shall not include \u201cThe use or consumption of tangible personal property . . . directly in any of the operations. . . . The producing, delivering or rendering of a public utility service. . . .\u201d An identical exclusion from an otherwise taxable sale at retail is contained in \u00a72(}) (7) (c).\nAct of March 6, 1956, P. L. (3955) 1228, as amended, 72 P.S. \u00a73408.1 et seq. The 1963 amendments changed the title of the act to the \u201cTax Act of 1963 for Education.\u201d Act of May 29, 1963, P. L. 49. \u00a72, 72 P.S. \u00a73403.1.\nAct of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1053, as amended, 66 P.S. \u00a71101 et seq. \u00a71102(17) (c) thereof includes common carriers within the definitional framework of a \u201cpublic utility.\u201d \u25a0 \u00a71102(5) excludes contract' carriers, such as Lafferty, from' -the definition1 of \u201ccommon carrier.\u201d\n66 P.S. \u00a71102(20)'.\n66 P.S. \u00a71102(17).\n\u201cPublic Utility\u201d is partially defined in \u00a72(17) of the Public-Utility Code (66 P.S. \u00a71102(17)) as \u201c. . . [Piersons or corporations now or hereafter owning or operating in this Commonwealth equipment, or facilities for: . . . .\u201d\n\u201cCorporation\u201d is in turn defined, so far as is germane, as: \u201c. . . [A]U bodies corporate . . ., but shall not include municipal corporations. . . .\u201d (Emphasis throughout added.) \u00a72(9) of the Public Utility Code (66 P.S. \u00a71102(9)).\nBriefs were submitted by Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (appellee) ; Charles A. McHugh (appellant) ; City of Philadelphia (intervenor-appellant) ; Pa. Electric Association, Pa. Gas Association, and Pa. Natural Gas Men\u2019s Association (amici curiae) ; The Penna. Water Companies of the Eastern Water Conference (amici curiae) ; Bell Telephone Co. of Pa. (amicus curiae).\nAt the outset of the opinion, Mr. -Justice Roberts states: \u201cBoth appellants are Pennsylvania public utilities . . . Both taxpayers operate under the provisions of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Raw, subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utility Commission and in accordance with tariffs filed with the Commission.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) Commonwealth v. Equitable Gas Co., 415 Pa. 113, 134-115, 202 A. 2d 11, 32, 13 (1964). It is only after this determination that' the Court initiates its discussion of the \u201cservice\u201d' question.\nOf course, the exclusion also applies in a McEugh situation or its counterpart. That is to say, if a potential taxpayer is involved in purchases or uses which are for the direct benefit of a public utility, to be used by that public utility in an excluded service, then the potential taxpayer might be likewise excluded from the sales and use tax. It should be evident that the rationale of McHugh is in no way limited to the strict facts of that case, i.e., to construction contractors only. Furthermore, the exclusion might also be available in the case of an entity long considered by the courts to be a public utility rendering what have been judicially declared to be public utility services though such entity does not come within the Public Utility Code. For language supportive of this assertion, see Commonwealth v. Equitable Gas Company, 415 Pa. 113, 116-117, 202 A. 2d 11 (1964). Cf. Com. v. Merritt-Chapman & Scott Corp., 3 CCH, Pa. Tax Reporter \u00b6 200-711 (July 25, 1967) (C.P. Dauphin County),\nReg. 227 Pennsylvania Bureau of Sales and,Use Tax, 2 CCH, Pa. Tax Reporter \u00b6 60-221.\nWe assume this argument rests on Art. IX \u00a71 of _ the Pennsylvania Constitution which states, in pertinent part: \u201cAll taxes shall he uniform, upon the same Glass of subjects, within the territorial limits of the authority levying the- tax. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nNo constitutional provision whatsoever was cited by Rafferty in its brief, nor by the Commonwealth,. both parties apparently content to grapple with the blanket assertion of \u201cunconstitutionality.\u201d\nWhile there seems to be little or no actual difference in the external operation of contract carriers and Class D common carriers, the fact remains that one is legislatively defined as a public utility and the other is not.\nThis determination automatically forecloses any federal constitutional argument based on the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution since both clauses stand in pari materia insofar as the instant issue is concerned.
