The sole complaint is his refusal to charge as requested : \u201c That, under all evidence in the case, the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d In view of the testimony, tending to prove that plaintiff\u2019s injury was the result of defendant\u2019s negligence, it would have been manifest error to have thus withdrawn the case from the jury by giving binding instractions to find for defendant. The ease was clearly for the jury, and it was submitted to them with instructions quite as favorable to the defendant as she could reasonably ask.\nJudgment affirmed."}
