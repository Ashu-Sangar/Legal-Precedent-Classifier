{"id": "1747339", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellants, Ella Mae Lehnig, administratrix of the estate of Alfred H. Lehnig, and Glasgow, Inc., decedent\u2019s employer, brought an action in trespass against appellees, seven employees of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. Decedent, a truckdriver, was killed and his employer\u2019s truck destroyed when the truck struck a deteriorated portion of a public highway. Decedent lost control of the truck and it plunged through a guardrail and down an embankment. Appellants allege that the road had been dangerously deteriorated for a substantial period of time, that inspection would have revealed the fact, and that the accident was caused by appellees\u2019 negligent failure to inspect and repair the road, or to warn the public of its dangerous condition.\nThe Court of Common Pleas of Washington County dismissed the complaint on the ground that appellees, as public employees, are immune from liability for ordinary negligence in the performance of their official functions. The Superior Court affirmed and we granted allocatur.\nIn DuBree v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 481 Pa. 540, 393 A.2d 293 (1978). this Court concluded that the liability of officials of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation \u201cshould not have been analyzed solely on the basis of their status as employees of the Commonwealth.\u201d 481 Pa. at 544, 393 A.2d at 294. Rather, \u201can examination is required of whether the considerations underlying \u2018official immunity\u2019 are effectively advanced.\u201d Id. Accordingly, in DuBree, this Court stated: \u201cWhere, but for the defendant\u2019s status, a right of action would lie under analogous rules of law, and no public policy would be promoted in shielding a defendant from liability, and the plaintiff has not failed to pursue existing remedies, denial of the possibility of recovery is unjustified.\u201d Id., 481 Pa. at 546, 393 A.2d at 296. We vacate the order of the Superior Court and remand to the Court of Common Pleas of Washington County for consideration in light of all the principles enunciated in DuBree.\nOrder of the Superior Court vacated and case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nEAGEN, C. J., dissents.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nWe hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204 (Supp. 1978)."}
