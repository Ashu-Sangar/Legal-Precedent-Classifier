{"id": "907084", "contents": "Peb Oubiam,\nThe circumstances that a portion of .the property of the plaintiff is reserved for use for its manufacturing purposes in case of emergency or to meet the demands of increasing business, does not alter or change its character as being part of the premises used or intended to be used for its essential objects. It is still a part of the property which in its entirety is exempt from local taxation as real estate. The distinction which is urged between \u201cthe manufacturing of electricity\u201d and \u201cthe supplying of it,\u201d is without force. The power to supply includes the power to manufacture it.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellants."}
