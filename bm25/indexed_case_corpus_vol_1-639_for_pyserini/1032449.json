{"id": "1032449", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe clearly expressed intention of the testator confines the distribution of the income from his estate to the children of his deceased niece, Eliza M. Fagan, and their issue. This was the correct conclusion of the Superior Court: Huddy\u2019s Estate, 63 Pa. Superior Ct. 34. Helen Fagan Moore, a grandniece, having died without issue, her interest in the income terminated with her death: Rowland\u2019s Est., 141 Pa. 553. Appeal dismissed and decree of Superior Court affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
