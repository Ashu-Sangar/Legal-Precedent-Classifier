{"id": "1132397", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Schaffer,\nBy the third item of his will, which appears in full in the Reporter\u2019s notes, the decedent devised to his sister, Cora Simpson Burg, a life estate in his property known as Oak Hall, with its contents. He provided that upon her death one-fourth thereof should pass absolutely and in fee simple to her heirs at law; one-fourth in the same manner to a brother, Horton Simpson; another fourth similarly to a sister, Caroline Simpson Stuart; and the remaining fourth to his brother, F. Stoddard Simpson, for life. Upon the latter\u2019s death, he directed that one-third of his one-fourth should go absolutely and in fee simple to the heirs at law of Cora Simpson Burg, one-third thereof by like language to Horton Simpson and the other third to Caroline Simpson Stuart. He further provided that should his sister Cora Simpson Burg, at any time after his death, desire to give up the property and abandon it as a home, she was empowered to sell it and to distribute the proceeds therefrom \u201camong herself and my brothers F. Stoddard Simpson and Horton Simpson and my sister Caroline Simpson Stuart, so that, each of said distributees or their heirs may receive an equal share.\u201d He further directed that the proceeds of the personalty located in the house should be similarly distributed. F. Stoddard Simpson died in the lifetime of the testator. Cora Simpson Burg elected to sell the property and the personalty in it. The sale realized a sum in excess of $18,000. Edith C. Simpson, widow of- F. Stoddard Simpson, claimed one-fourth of the proceeds of the sale as an heir of her husband. In this declaratory judgment proceeding the court' below determined that she was entitled to such share of the fund. From this decision and the resulting decree in her favor, this appeal is brought.\nIt is the contention of the appellants that the legacy to F. Stoddard Simpson lapsed because of his death prior to that of the testator and that his heirs are not entitled to any part of the fund, and, in any event, his widow is not included within the meaning of the word \u201cheirs\u201d as used in the will. We can assent to the proposition that at common law where a legatee died before the testator, his legacy lapsed (Robinson v. Martin, 2 Yeates 525; Weishaupt v. Brehman, 5 Binney 115; Dickinson v. Purvis, 8 S. & R. 71; Martindale v. Warner, 15 Pa. 471), and to the conclusion that under the Wills Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 403, sec. 15 [b], a legacy to a brother is saved from lapsing only if he leaves issue, which F. Stoddard Simpson did not, but under the will before us we are not concerned with the question of lapsing, because, if we consider the will as written, the provision under which his widow claims is a substitutionary one. The gift is to F. Stoddard Simpson or his heirs. The peculiarity of the will is that whereas F. Stoddard Simpson was given but a life estate in the property if it was not sold, he was given an absolute interest in the proceeds of it should it be disposed of. It will further be noted that when the testator was devising the property as real es'tate, he used the term \u201cheirs at law\u201d of his brothers and sisters, but when he came to dispose of the proceeds in the event of sale he changed the direction to his brothers and sisters \u201cor their heirs\u201d; indicating that he had a different disposition in mind if the latter contingency arose.\nAs we have said more than once, \u201cPrecedents are of little value in the construction of wills\u201d: Scott\u2019s Est., 301 Pa. 509, 512. Recognizing this, we are nevertheless aided in construing the one before us by precedents which are in a line of some length. The rule in England is that the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in an immediate legacy operates to prevent a lapse: Gittings v. M\u2019Dermott, 2 Mylne & Keen\u2019s Chancery Reports 69 (1834). Judge Gest of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia, whose learning on this branch of our law is recognized throughout the Commonwealth, in Shoenberger\u2019s Est., 22 Pa. Dist. R. 126, 128, thus sums up the authorities: \u201cIt is well settled that a legacy or devise to a particular person 'or\u2019 Ms heirs, or to one 'or\u2019 his representatives, will not lapse upon the death of the legatee or devisee before the testator; the gift is substitutionary and the only question is who are entitled to take. This appears to be the rule in Pennsylvania (Gilmore\u2019s Estate, 154 Pa. 523), as it is in England (Gittings v. M\u2019Dermott, 2 Mylne & Keen 69; Be Crawford\u2019s Trusts, 2 Drew 234), as well as in New York (McCormick v. Burke, 2 Dem. 137; Wright v. Church, 1 Hoffman, 202; Wetmore v. Peck, 66 How. Pr. 543), although in a bequest to a person 'and\u2019 his heirs, no substitutionary gift can be inferred: Bolles v. Bacon, 3 Dem. 43; Van Beuren v. Dash, 30 N. Y. 393; Re Wells, 113 N. Y. 396. The reason would appear to be that in a gift to A 'and\u2019 his heirs, the gift is single, taking effect either at one and the same time in favor of the legatee 'and his heirs\u2019 or else not taking effect at all; whereas, in a gift to A 'or\u2019 his heirs, the gift is in the alternative, clearly indicating both 'A\u2019 and 'his heirs\u2019 as objects of the gift, the 'heirs\u2019 taking in the event of the nonexistence of 'A.\u2019 This is held sufficient by liber\u00e1lity of interpretation to overcome the presumption that the words heirs, representatives, etc., following the name of the legatee, have merely their ordinary meaning as indicative of the quantity of the estate granted.\u201d We said in Worst v. DeHaven, 262 Pa. 39, that the word \u201cor\u201d may be read as if it were \u201cand\u201d and \u201cand\u201d as if it were \u201cor\u201d when it is absolutely necessary to carry out the expressed intent of the testator but only in that event. In Bender v. Bender, 226 Pa. 607, we held that the word \u201cor\u201d implied a substitutionary gift. Wunder\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 281, is another instance of a substitutional gift although in that case the word \u201cor\u201d was not used. Gilmor\u2019s Est., 154 Pa. 523, directly rules the question before us in favor of appellee.\nWe are not at all concerned with the question of technical conversion because the conversion of the real estate into money was outright and actual and the fund is personalty and was so bequeathed. In a bequest of personalty a widow will be considered an heir of her husband unless a contrary intent is indicated by the will: Wunder\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 281; Gilmor\u2019s Est., 154 Pa. 523; Eby\u2019s App., 84 Pa. 241. \u201cWhere the word \u2018heirs\u2019 is used in a bequest of personalty, it means heirs as ascertained by the statutes of distribution, unless a contrary intent is indicated by the will\u201d: Wunder\u2019s Est. at page 283.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost."}
