The appellant\u2019s paper-book contains none of the documentary evidence necessary to an understanding of the case. All that we have is a copy of the oil and gas lease, made by D. K. Clever to J. M. Guffey and J. H. Galey. None of the papers connected with the proceedings in partition is before us.\nThe decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
