Plaintiff admitted the barrels were not all marked as required above, but the record does not disclose how many were and how many were not marked, the excuse for the failure to mark them all being because defendant \u201ctook it [the box car] away before I had a chance to mark the barrels.\u201d The bill of lading does not specify any markings as appearing on any of the barrels, yet defendant accepted the freight for transportation despite its regulation above quoted. The car thus loaded was taken by defendant over its railway to a point in the City of New York, where the brass was transferred to a car of the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company, for carriage by the latter company to the point of destination. It was not delivered there, but which of the railroad companies was in fault in this respect does not appear. At plaintiff\u2019s request a tracer was sent out by defendant, and the brass was located in the City of Boston; after which the defendant apparently did nothing, and the brass was sold, presumably as unclaimed freight, in order to recoup the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company for its freight charges thereagainst. The court below refused defendant\u2019s point for binding instructions, instructed the jury to find a verdict for plaintiff, later dismissed defendant\u2019s motion for judgment non obstante veredicto and entered judgment on the verdict, and defendant thereupon appealed, challenging only the rulings on these matters.\nHad defendant observed its own regulations, and the loss been occasioned by plaintiff\u2019s failure to comply therewith, the point it now seeks to raise, viz, is a carrier responsible for a loss resulting from the shipper\u2019s failure to obey its rules? would have been up for consideration. Here, however, defendant by its haste prevented plaintiff from marking the freight as required, did not \u201cobserve\u201d its own regulations, \u2014 as the Act of 1910, relied on (by it), requires it to do, \u2014 in that it received freight which was not all properly marked, and issued a through bill of lading therefor which did not show the markings on the barrels; and yet seeks to escape the liability which the act of Congress imposes, though the fault was all its own. This of course it cannot do; and hence, since the assignments of error do not question the amount of the verdict, we need not consider the other points argued; though it may be said the maximum of escape from liability would, in any event, be the value of the brass in the unmarked barrels, and, though having the burden of proof on this point, defendant gave no evidence as to either the number or value.\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed."}
