{"id": "1370965", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nAppellant, Lena Schultz, appeals from the order of the Commonwealth Court reversing the order of the trial court denying appellees\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings. We affirm.\nAppellant\u2019s son Steven Shultz was an adult patient at Clarks Summit State Hospital. On the evening of January 4,1999, he walked out of the hospital through an unlocked door when his attendant\u2019s attention was momentarily diverted. Despite a search, decedent was not found until the next day, frozen to death approximately one-half mile from the hospital.\nAppellant instituted wrongful death and survival actions against appellees. The parties settled the survival action and agreed that appellees would file a motion for judgment on the pleadings to resolve the questions of whether a parent can recover non-pecuniary losses resulting from a child\u2019s death within the context of a wrongful death action and whether sovereign immunity is a bar to recovery against appellees. The trial court denied the motion, finding that \u201csince it is not absolutely clear as a matter of law that such damages are not recoverable, judgment on the pleadings is inappropriate and must be denied.\u201d Memorandum and Order, 9/3/02, at 8. The trial court certified its interlocutory order for immediate appeal, pursuant to Rule 702(b) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702(b). Appellees filed a petition for permission to appeal to the Commonwealth Court pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1311(b); the court granted the request.\nThe Commonwealth Court reversed, agreeing appellant\u2019s action was not barred by sovereign immunity, but it concluded a parent may not recover non-pecuniary losses under the Wrongful Death Act. Department of Public Welfare v. Schultz, 822 A.2d 876, 878 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003). This Court granted review to determine if such losses are recoverable.\nAppellant contends that, as decedent\u2019s parent, she is entitled to recover non-pecuniary damages from the Commonwealth under the Wrongful Death Act. Because damages are sought from the Commonwealth, recovery under the Wrongful Death Act must be examined in the context of the Sovereign Immunity Act. Thus, we do not resolve the issue of whether the Wrongful Death Act, outside the context of sovereign immunity, permits recovery of such damages in a suit against a private party.\nGenerally, suits against the Commonwealth are not permissible. Exceptions to the general proscription against suing the Commonwealth are provided in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522. Section 8522(a) provides:\nThe General Assembly ... does hereby waive, in the instances set forth in subsection (b) only and only to the extent set forth in this subchapter and within the limits set forth in section 8528 (relating to limitations on damages), sovereign immunity as a bar to an action against Commonwealth parties, for damages arising out of a negligent act where the damages would be recoverable under the common law or a statute creating a cause of action if the injury were caused by a person not having available the defense of sovereign immunity.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(a). Appellant argues the limitations \u2022 of the Sovereign Immunity Act apply only to common law rather than statutory claims against the Commonwealth. We find no merit to this argument where the plain language of the Act provides the limitations of \u00a7 8522 and the limitations on damages of \u00a7 8528 apply in all suits against the Commonwealth arising \u201cunder the common law or a statute.\u201d\nSovereign immunity is waived where damages result from medical-professional liability. Id. \u00a7 8522(b)(2). However, pursuant to \u00a7 8528(c), only the following damages may be recovered:\n(1) Past and future loss of earnings and earning capacity.\n(2) Pain and suffering.\n(3) Medical and dental expenses including the reasonable value of reasonable and necessary medical and dental services, prosthetic devices and necessary ambulance, hospital, professional nursing, and physical therapy expenses accrued and anticipated in the diagnosis, care and recovery of the claimant.\n(4) Loss of consortium.\n(5) Property losses, except that property losses shall not be recoverable in claims brought pursuant to section 8522(b)(5) (relating to potholes and other dangerous conditions).\nId. \u00a7 8528(c). Of the available damages recoverable under \u00a7 8528(c), appellant\u2019s claim for non-pecuniary losses could only fall into the loss of consortium category.\nDamages for loss of consortium are available only to spouses, and do not include a parent\u2019s loss of society and companionship of her child. See Cleveland v. Johns-Manville Corp., 547 Pa. 402, 690 A.2d 1146, 1149 (1997) (claim for loss of consortium arises from marital relationship); Quinn v. Pittsburgh, 243 Pa. 521, 90 A. 353, 354 (1914) (only spouse may recover for loss of companionship). Because a parent cannot bring an action for loss of consortium resulting from the death of her child, appellant is barred under the Sovereign Immunity Act from bringing an action against the Commonwealth for non-pecuniary losses.\nAppellant relies on two Commonwealth Court decisions, Huda v. Kirk, 122 Pa.Cmwlth. 129, 551 A.2d 637 (1988), and Quinn v. PennDOT, 719 A.2d 1105 (Pa.Cmwlth.1998), in support of her assertion that because children are permitted to recover non-pecuniary damages from the Commonwealth, parents should be allowed as well. In Huda, although the court recognized damages for loss of consortium are recoverable against the Commonwealth in a wrongful death action, the court incorrectly held that both decedent\u2019s husband and children may recover for the loss of decedent\u2019s comfort and society. Huda, at 638-39. Huda failed to recognize that only the husband is permitted to recover for loss of consortium, a claim founded on the marital relationship.\nThe Commonwealth Court in Quinn concluded damages for loss of a parent\u2019s guidance, tutelage, and moral upbringing were recoverable by a child, not under a general theory of loss of consortium but as damages allowable under the Wrongful Death Act. Quinn, at 1109-10. However, this case failed to recognize that damages recoverable against the Commonwealth under the Wrongful Death Act are subject .to the limitations of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8528(c). We reiterate that here, the Wrongful Death Act must be tempered by the context of the Sovereign Immunity Act.\nAppellant further relies on this Court\u2019s decision in Tulewicz v. SEPTA 529 Pa. 584, 606 A.2d 425, 426 (1991), where we held damages, including those for the loss of guidance, tutelage, and general upbringing of the decedent\u2019s daughter awarded pursuant to the Wrongful Death Act, were not excessive. Following the grant of reargument, this Court held the Sovereign Immunity Act and its statutory cap on damages was applicable because SEPTA was a Commonwealth agency. Tulewicz, 529 Pa. 588, 606 A.2d 427, 430-31. This Court, however, did not address whether damages for the loss of guidance, tutelage, and general upbringing of a child could be awarded against a Commonwealth agency.\nTherefore, given the plain language of the Sovereign Immunity Act, we hold a parent may not recover non-pecuniary losses from the Commonwealth resulting from the death of a child because such action is barred by the Act. Thus, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court prohibiting the recovery of such damages.\nOrder affirmed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\n\u25a0 Justice NEWMAN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\u25a0 Justice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion in which Justice NIGRO joins.\nChief Justice CAPPY concurs in the result.\n. Appellant sought recovery of the following non-pecuniary losses: comfort, society, love, affection, companionship, support, and friendship.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8301 provides, in pertinent part, that damages may be recovered by a parent for the death of a child caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8301(a), (b).\n. The Sovereign Immunity Act bars actions against the Commonwealth for damages from negligent acts unless such immunity has been waived. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8501 et seq."}
