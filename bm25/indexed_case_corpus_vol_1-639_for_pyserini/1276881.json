{"id": "1276881", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nOn December 21, 1953, the Borough of Green Tree enacted Ordinance No. 419 which added the following provision to the borough zoning regulations: \u201cSection 14: In Local .Business District a Gasoline Service Station may be established, erected or enlarged provided there is filed with the application for a permit the written consent of the owners in interest and number, of a majority of all of the property within one hundred (100) feet of the proposed structure and not separated therefrom by more than one street forty feet or more in width. In computing the percentage of consents required under this provision so much property as is already used for Gasoline Service Stations shall be counted as' consenting. The property owned by the applicant shall not be counted in determining the consents required.\u201d\nIn 1955 the Standard Oil Company (referred to as Esso) obtained an option to purchase a property in Green Tree Borough belonging to one Amelia Ramsey, Esso exercised the option on a portion of the Ramsey property in February 1956, took title on May 31, and on June 1 of that year filed with the borough\u2019s secretary an application for a building permit. Attached to the application were the written consents of three adjacent property owners, Meehan, Ramsey and McClay, to the erection of a service station by Esso. Only their three properties were within one hundred feet of the main building which Esso proposed to erect. Subsequently, McClay revoked his consent. The building inspector and chairman of the borough zoning committee refused the application, and Esso appealed to the board of adjustment. The board held that since Esso had complied with all of the provisions of the borough\u2019s zoning ordinance, it was entitled to a build: ing permit. From this decision the borough appealed to the county court Contending that the consent of the. owners in interest and number of a majority of all property within one hundred feet of the proposed structure was lacking. The applicant, Esso, upon petition to intervene was duly joined as a party respondent in the proceeding.\nWhile the appeal was pending in the county court, the borough on November 28, 1956, by Ordinance No. 497, amended the zoning ordinance of 1953 to require an application for a building permit to be accompanied-by th\u00e9 written cons\u00e9nt of the owners of \u201ceighty (80% )' per cent of all the property within one hundred ten \u25a0 (110) feet of the deed line of the property in question.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).\nThe court nevertheless proceeded under the 1953 ordinance, and concluded that the board of adjustment \u2022had properly granted the permit. From the order of the county court directing the building inspector to issue the building permit to Esso, Theodore Hertrick, Secretary of the Borough of Green Tree, and W. J. Dunbar, Building Inspector of the Borough, have taken this joint appeal.\nThe issues before us are whether errors of law have been made in the construction of the ordinance of 1953 and in the refusal of the court below to apply the ordinance of 1956 to the present proceedings. See Archbishop O\u2019Hara\u2019s Appeal, 389 Pa. 35, 51, 131 A. 2d 587 (1957).\nThe first question raised by the appellants is whether the written consents filed by Esso in support of its application for a permit to construct a gasoline service station meet the requirements of the 1953 zoning ordinance with regard to number and interest of the adjoining land owners.\nThis ordinance provides that a \u201cGas Service Station may be established . . . with . . . the . . . consent of the owners in interest and number, of a majority of all of the property within one hundred (100) feet of the proposed structure.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).\nThe appellants contend that \u201cthe proposed structure\u201d as used in this section refers to the whole, integrated service station installation including signs, light standards, pumps, gasoline tanks and other facilities. Since there are seven properties within a hundred feet of the perimeter of the area of the installation, under the appellants\u2019 theory Esso did not obtain the consent of the requisite number of property owners.\nThe zoning ordinance itself defines \u201cstructure\u201d as \u201c[ajnything constructed or erected, the use of which demands a permanent location on the soil. . . .\u201d Granting that tanks, pumps and other facilities might all be \u201cstructures\u201d as that term is defined in the zoning ordinance, the question remains what did the borough council intend by its use of the phrase \u201cthe proposed structure\u201d in section 14 of the ordinance?\nA reading of this section indicates that the phrase \u201cthe proposed structure\u201d refers to the \u201cgasoline service station.\u201d A gasoline service station is, in common usage, a building from which gasoline and auto supplies are sold. Appellants\u2019 position that the word \u201cstructure\u201d was used in section 14 to denote the entire service station installation, which is itself composed of separate \u201cstructures\u201d, is justified neither by the definition of the word given in the ordinance itself nor by common usage. We are of the opinion that the council having used the singular \u2014 \u201cthe proposed structure\" \u2014 intended to refer to and contemplated only the proposed main building and consequently, it is from this \u201cstructure\u201d that the hundred feet measurement must be made in order to determine the property owners from whom consent is required. On this basis, only Meehan, McClay and Eamsey are the property owners whose consents to the Esso application would be required by the ordinance of 1953.\nNo question is raised as to the validity of the Meehan consent. However, the appellants seek the disqualification of the consent given by Mrs. Ramsey for the reason that she was the record owner of the tract of land from which the applicant\u2019s property was obtained. This circumstance is patently irrelevant to our consideration. Mrs. Ramsey is the owner of property situated within a hundred feet of the proposed main building of Esso. She is not the applicant for a permit to construct a gasoline service station. Hence, her consent is valid under the ordinance, and thus must be included in determining whether the applicant, Esso, has complied with the ordinance.\n' Because the consents of owners Ramsey and Meehan are valid, Esso has obtained the required written consents from the majority of the owners both in interest and in number of the relevant adjacent property, and would therefore be entitled to the issuance of a building permit. Consequently, we are not required to determine the effect of McClay\u2019s withdrawal of his consent after the filing of Esso\u2019s application.\nThe second contention of the appellants requires us to determine the relevancy to the present proceedings of the 1956 ordinance requiring consent of the owners of eighty percent of property within one hundred ten feet of the deed line of the land upon which the service station is to be built.\nWe have held that a building permit may be refused if at the time of application there is pending an amendment to a zoning ordinance which would prohibit the use of the land for which the permit is sought. Shender v. Zoning Board of Adjustment, 388 Pa. 265, 131 A. 2d 90 (1957) ; A. J. Aberman, Inc. v. New Kensington, 377 Pa. 520, 105 A. 2d 586 (1954) ; Gold v. Building Committee of Warren Borough, 334 Pa. 10, 5 A. 2d 367 (1939) ; But cf. Kline v. Harrisburg, 362 Pa. 438, 68 A. 2d 182 (1949). Even when an applicant is issued a permit, unless he proceeds in good faith to incur substantial obligations in reliance thereon, the permit may be vacated or revoked because of subsequently adopted amendments to the zoning ordinance which prohibit the proposed use of the land. A. N. \u201cAb\u201d Young Co. Zoning Case, 360 Pa. 429, 61 A. 2d 839 (1948); Herskovits v. Irwin, 299 Pa. 155, 149 Atl. 195 (1930). The rule established by these cases was designed to prevent the creation of what would become a non-conforming use after the effective date of a pending zoning ordinance. However, no such policy is involved in the case before us.\nThe 1956 amendment to the Green Tree zoning ordinance does not affect or change the use to which land may be put. Instead, it introduces a change in the procedure necessary to obtain a building permit by increasing the number of consents required from land owners in the area. Thus the amendment was not an effort to improve the community by upgrading land use, but rather an enactment which increased the power and domination of neighboring land owners over a particular piece of land. An application for a building permit should not be affected by an amendatory ordinance- enacted after the application was filed when the ordinance does not upgrade land use. We conclude that Esso\u2019s application for a permit was properly considered under the law in effect at the time its application was filed.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Benjamin B. Jones concurs in the result.\nThis provision becomes intelligible when interpreted as if written \u201cA majority of the owners in interest and number, of all of th\u00e9'property.\nZoning ordinances requiring the consent of neighboring property owners for specified uses of property raise serious constitutional questions. See Perrin\u2019s Appeal, 305 Pa. 42, 156 Atl. 305 (1931) (Zoning ordinance prohibiting the use of property for gasoline station, unless written consents obtained from owners in interest and number of a majority of all property fronting on the same block within 80 feet of site, held not to violate Fourteenth Amendment because non-consenting owner could seek equitable relief to enjoin a threatened nuisance). But see Annotation, 21 A.I/.R. 2nd 551 (1952). However, the constitutionality of the Green Tree ordinance was not challenged by counsel, and since we hold that the appellant is entitled to the permit sought, a determination of the validity of the present ordinance is unnecessary to our disposition of this ease."}
