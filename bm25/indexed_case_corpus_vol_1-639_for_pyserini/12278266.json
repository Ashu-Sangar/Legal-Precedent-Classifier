Erie Insurance Co., 65 A.3d 452 (Pa. Super. 2013), and ruling that:\n(1) a claimant seeking uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits must file a Complaint or a Petition to Compel Arbitration if the claim does not resolve within four years of the date of the underlying accident, and,\n(2) a claimant must file a Complaint or Petition to Compel Arbitration, contrary to the plain language of the Arbitration Act of 1927, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7304(a), which requires a claimant to file a Complaint or Petition only when \u201can opposing party refuse[s] to arbitrate,\u201d\ndid the Superior Court create a new rule that is contrary to prior decisions of this Court and inconsistent with the plain language of the Arbitration Act?\nThis Court understands this issue to encompass a determination of the time at which a cause of action accrues\u2014thereby triggering the commencement of the statutory period for bringing a claim\u2014in the specific context of an insurance contract containing a mandatory arbitration provision. Notably, this particular issue has not been waived, was advanced in the Petition for Allowance of Appeal, and has been briefed by both parties, without objection. As such, no further briefing is necessary.\nChief Justice Saylor files a concurring statement in which Justices Baer, Todd, Donohue, Dougherty and Mundy join.\nJustice Wecht files a dissenting statement."}
