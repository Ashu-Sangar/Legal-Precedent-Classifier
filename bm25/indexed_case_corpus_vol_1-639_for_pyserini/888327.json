{"id": "888327", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nThis action was brought against the defendants, partners, etc., in the name of the \u201c Philadelphia Stock Exchange,\u201d to recover the sum of $2,461.25, net proceeds of the membership of plain-tiff\u2019s testator in said stock exchange sold by them under a special power of attorney executed and delivered by her to them for that purpose, etc., as fully set forth in her statement of claim.\nWithout traversing or denying any of. the material averments of fact contained in said statement, the defendants, by way of confession and avoidance, rely on the averments contained in their affidavit and supplemental affidavit of defense. The learned court below adjudged those averments insufficient and entered the judgment from which this appeal was taken.\nIn the supplemental affidavit it is averred in substance that plaintiff\u2019s testator was a member of L. H. Taylor & Co., all the members of which firm, at the time of testator\u2019s death and prior thereto, were individually members of the stock exchange; that the surviving members of said firm filed a claim against testator\u2019s membership in the stock exchange for indebtedness to said firm, which indebtedness by the constitution and by-laws of said exchange is given a preference; that said claim was duly proved to the satisfaction of the arbitration committee; that upon the award being made the money was paid to the surviving partners, and the defendants now hold no money due or owing to the plaintiff.\nThe constitution of the exchange, which by reference is made part of the affidavit of defense, provides in article V. section 5, for an arbitration committee, whose duties it shall be to investigate and decide all claims and matters of difference between members of the exchange, which may be brought before it, arising from transactions in bonds, bullion, stocks, or other securities, or from any transactions in money.\u201d\nSection 4 of article XI., providing for the case of \u201c any member wishing to sell his membership,\u201d directs when and how it shall be done, how and to whom the proceeds shall be applied, and to whom the residue, if any, shall be paid, etc. \u2022\nSection 5 of same article makes provision for sale or transfer of membership \u201cwhen a member dies,\u201d and directs how the proceeds thereof shall be applied, and to whom the residue, if any, shall be paid, etc.\nSection 10 of same article declares: \u201c The liability of every membership, whether solvent or insolvent, to its owner\u2019s creditors in the stock exchange shall include all indebtedness to a firm, any member of which is also a member of the exchange, contracted during the existence of the copartnership.\u201d\nFrom a careful consideration of the constitution of the stock exchange, especially the provisions above referred to, it is quite apparent that the purpose is to provide for settlement of claims pertaining to the business of said exchange, or other business similar thereto, or, as expressed in section 4 article XI., \u201c for transactions arising in or relating to the business of banker or stock exchange broker.\u201d The enumeration of the powers of the \u201c arbitration committee,\u201d which are referred to in several of said sections and must be read into them, is conclusive of this construction. The maxim, inclusio unius est exclusio alterius, is clearly applicable. Assuming that we are correct in thus construing the constitution, it necessarily follows that it is not every kind of indebtedness between members that is allowed the preference provided for, but only such kinds of indebtedness as are specified in the constitution.\nAs quoted in full in the affidavit of defense, the claim filed by the surviving members of testator\u2019s firm is as follows: \u201c As the late Mr. William Allison Cochran was indebted to our firm at the time of his death for something over $3,000, we hereby file a claim against his membership in the exchange for $3,000.\u201d There is no designation here of the character of the claim, nothing to show that it is \u201c for transactions arising in or relating to the business of banker or stock exchange broker,\u201d nor is there anything to even indicate that the claim was \u201c contracted during the existence of the copartnership.\u201d The affidavit of defense may be searched in vain for anything like a definite averment of the nature of the claim. The nearest approach thereto is a possible inference that the claim was of the kind contemplated by the constitution. It is stated in the affidavit that, \u201c It was in consequence (of the notice) determined by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange that the aforesaid claim of Lewis H. Taylor & Co., should be arbitrated regularly by the arbitration committee of that body,\u201d and that the claim \u201cwas duly proved to the satisfaction of the arbitration committee.\u201d While this may warrant an inference that the claim is of the kind contemplated by tbe constitution of tbe stock exchange, it falls very far short of the requirement of a specific statement in an affidavit of defense. As already stated, it is nowhere averred that the claim was for indebtedness \u201c contracted during the existence of the copartnership \u201d of Lewis H. Taylor and Co. as required by section 10 of article XI., supra. Even if that section indicated an intention to enlarge the class of claims to \u201c all indebtedness \u201d without regard to the character thereof (which it does not), it must have been contracted \u201c during the existence of the partnership,\u201d and that fact should have been distinctly averred.'\nWe are therefore of opinion that the affidavits of defense were insufficient to prevent a summary judgment; and hence there was no error in making the rule for judgment absolute.\nJudgment affirmed."}
