{"id": "963133", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe devise was \u201cto Cecilia Hittle, the wife of my deceased son, Elias Keiper, the lot where I am now living. . . . After the death of Cecilia, the above described lot shall go to her children.\u201d Prima facie the word \u201c children \u201d is a word of purchase and not of limitation, and standing alone without qualification it must be given its ordinary meaning. It will not be construed as a word of limitation unless there is found in the will an intention so to use it. That the first taker had no children when the will was made or when it went into effect does not warrant such a construction where the gift to the children is not immediate but by way of remainder: Cote v. VonBonnhorst, 41 Pa. 243; Curtis v. Longstreth, 44 Pa. 297; Keim\u2019s Appeal, 125 Pa. 480; Lancaster v. Flowers, 198 Pa. 614.\nWe find nothing in the other parts of the will that indicates an intention to use the word \u201cchildren\u201d as a word of limitation.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
