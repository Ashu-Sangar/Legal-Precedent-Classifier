{"id": "1948621", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Chief Justice Jones,\nWe have consolidated these two appeals because both involve the constitutionality of our criminal statutes proscribing abortions.\nOn October 21, 1968, Barry Page, a motorcycle mechanic with medical training as a Merchant Marine corpsman, pled guilty to the performance of two abortions. Page\u2019s guilty plea resulted in his conviction and a sentence of two-to-five years\u2019 imprisonment. There was no direct appeal, but Page did seek, and obtain, relief under Post Conviction Hearing Act provisions, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. \u00a71180-1 et seq. The Court of Common Pleas of Centre County ruled that the anti-abortion statute, Section 718 of the act, was unconstitutional. Pursuant to Section 202(9) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P. L. 673, \u00a7202(9), 17 P.S. \u00a7211.202(9), the Commonwealth has taken a direct appeal to this Court upon the order granting Page\u2019s Post Conviction Hearing Act petition.\nBenjamin King, M.D., was convicted of performing an abortion which resulted in the death of his patient.3 After disposition of post-trial motions which did not include a constitutional challenge to the abortion-causing death statute, Hi*. King was sentenced to two-to-five years\u2019 imprisonment by the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas. An appeal was taken by Dr. King to the Superior Court, which certified the appeal to us because of the pendency of the Page appeal.\nIt is important, though not critical for the purpose of passing upon these appeals, that Dr. King and Barry Page were prosecuted under separate sections of the act. Page was prosecuted under Section 718, the antiabortion statute which proscribes the procurement of a pregnant woman\u2019s miscarriage by any means with \u201cunlawful\u201d intent. Dr. King was charged with a violation of Section 71.9 which punishes the procurement of a miscarriage causing the death of the pregnant woman or the \u201cchild\u201d with which she is \u201cquick.\u201d Our scrutiny of Sections 718 and 719 of the act does not permit a material despecification of these sections from the Texas anti-abortion statutes which were struck down by the United States Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973). Because we deem the difference between the Texas and Pennsylvania statutes inappreciable in the application of Roe v. Wade, we hold that Sections 718 and 719 are unconstitutional as violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because these provisions fail to comport with the permissible scope of state regulation of abortion.\nBecause Sections 718 and 719 are unconstitutional the prosecutions of Page and King, commenced under the provisions of these statutes, cannot sustain the convictions thus obtained.\nThe order of the Centre County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed and the judgment of sentence of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas is reversed.\nMr. Justice Manderino concurs in the result.\n\u201c\u00a7718\n\u201cWhoever, with intent to procure the miscarriage of any woman, unlawfully administers to her any poison, drug or substance, or unlawfully uses any instrument, or other means, with the like intent, is guilty of felony, and upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding three thousand dollars ($3,000), or undergo imprisonment by separate or solitary confinement at labor not exceeding five (5) years, or both.\n\u201c\u00a7719\n\u201cWhoever unlawfully administers to any woman, pregnant or quick with child, or supposed and believed to be pregnant or quick with child, any drug, poison or other substance, or unlawfully uses any instrument or other means, with the intent to procure the miscarriage of such woman, resulting in the death of such woman, or any child with which she may be quick, is guilty of felony, and upon conviction thereof, shall be sentenced to pay a fine not exceeding six thousand dollars ($6,000), or undergo imprisonment by separate or solitary confinement at labor not exceeding ten (10) years, or both.\u201d Act of June 24, 1939, P. B. 872, \u00a7\u00a7718-719, 18 P.S. \u00a7\u00a74718-4719.\nBoth operations were successfully performed and each \u201cpatient\u201d survived the procedure without physical impairment.\nThe Commonwealth does not argue that Page \u201cwaived\u201d the constitutional question by failing to raise it on direct appeal. Though the \u201cwaiver\u201d concept has recognized the legitimate need for procedural regularity, if the Commonwealth is not inclined to argue the issue, we should not raise it sua sponte.\nIn the course of the abortion, Dr. King perforated the decedent\u2019s cervix. She sustained peritonitis, massive hemorrhaging and, as a consequence, suffered severe traumatic shock. The patient expired on December 30, 1967, two days after the abortion procedure.\nWhile generally we will not consider issues, on direct appeal, which were not presented in post-trial motions (Commonwealth v. Donovan, 447 Pa. 450, 291 A. 2d 116 (1972) ; Commonwealth v. Jacobs, 445 Pa. 364, 284 A. 2d 717 (1971) ; Commonwealth v. Bittner, 441 Pa. 216, 272 A. 2d 484 (1971)), we have enunciated an exception to that rule when, as here, the issue is one of public policy. Commonwealth v. Dessus, 423 Pa. 177, 187, 224 A. 2d 188, 193 (1966) ; Muse-Art Corp. v. Philadelphia, 373 Pa. 329, 95 A. 2d 542 (1953) ; Schline v. Kine, 301 Pa. 586, 152 A. 845 (1930).\nApproximately four and one-half months after the disposition of Dr. King\u2019s post-trial motions, the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas, Civil Division, declared Section 718, the anti-abortion statute, unconstitutionally vague and violative of due process. Berman v. Duggan, 119 P.L.X 226 (1971). Berman was not appealed to this Court.\nAlthough appellee Page argues that Section 718 suffers from unconstitutional vagueness because of the unqualified use of \u201cunlawful,\u201d we reach our decision here on other grounds according with the recent United States Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 313 (1973). Bee, also, Doe v. Bolten, 410 U.S. 179 (3973). We need not consider the \u201cvagueness\u201d argument.\nThe Texas statutes considered and invalidated by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade, which resemble Sections 718 and 719 of our anti-abortion act, are articles 1191 and 1194 of the Texas State Penal Code:\n\u201cArticle 1191. Abortion.\n\u201cIf any person shall designedly administer to a pregnant woman or knowingly procure to be administered with her consent any drug or medicine, or shall use towards her any violence or means whatever externally or internally applied, and thereby procure an abortion, he shall be confined in the penitentiary not less than two nor more than five years; if it be done without her consent, the punishment shall be doubled. By \u2018abortion\u2019 is meant that the life of the fetus or embryo shall be destroyed in the woman\u2019s womb or that a premature birth thereof be caused.\n\u201cArticle 1194. Murder in producing abortion.\n\u201cIf the death of the mother is occasioned by an abortion so produced or by an attempt to effect the same it is murder.\u201d\nThat the Supreme Court considered the Texas statutes and our anti-abortion provisions \u201csimilar\u201d, for purposes of the application of the decision in Roe v. Wade, is evidenced by the inclusion of a citation to Sections 718 and 719 of our act in Mr. Justice Blackmdh\u2019s footnote to his textual statement that \u201c[sjimilar statutes are in existence in a majority of the States.2\u201d 410 U.S. at 118.\nThe permissible regulatory role of the States is carefully delineated by Mr. Justice Blackmun :\n\u201c(a) For the stage prior to approximately the end of the first trimester, the abortion decision and its effectuation must be left to the medical judgment of the pregnant woman\u2019s attending physician.\n\u201c(b) For the stage subsequent to approximately the end of the first trimester, the State, in promoting its interest in the health of the mother, may, if it chooses, regulate the abortion procedure in ways that are reasonably related to maternal health.\n\u201c(c) For the stage subsequent to viability the State, in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life, may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\u201d 410 U.S. at 164.\nIt is important to note that the Supreme Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Blackmun, in delineating the permissible scope of state regulation of abortion in Roe v. Wade, allowed that the state could \u201cproscribe any abortion by a person who is not a physician [as \u2018physician\u2019 is defined by the State].\u201d 410 U.S. at 165. We do not hold hero that the Commonwealth could not have proceeded against Barry Page for the lay practice of gynecology and obstetrics had it chosen to proceed under the Medical Practice Act, Act of June 3, 1911, P. L. 639, \u00a72, as amended, 63 P.S. \u00a7401a."}
