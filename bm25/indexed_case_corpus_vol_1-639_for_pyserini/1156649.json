{"id": "1156649", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nThe jury have found that the defendant, Tom Mix, a well-known actor in Wild West and cowboy shows, entered into an oral contract with the plaintiff, The Western Show Co., Inc., by which, in consideration of $10,000 a week and certain accommodations to be furnished to Mm, he agreed to act in plaintiff\u2019s circns daily during the season of 1929, which it was estimated would last about twenty weeks. Admittedly he did not keep his contract, but, on the contrary, entered into another agreement with a rival circus \u2014 the Sells-Floto Company, \u2014with which he performed during the time covered by his contract with plaintiff.\nThe present trial was the second trial of the case, the first having been reviewed by us in an opinion reported in 308 Pa. 215. That plaintiff is entitled to recover damages from defendant for the breach of his contract cannot be doubted, and that they were substantial and not merely nominal, is also beyond cavil; but the difficulty then was, and now is, to find \u201ca reasonably safe basis\u201d for calculating them. We did not see then, nor do we now see, nor has appellant suggested, how they could be measured adequately, other than by proof of the probable decrease in the attendance, and hence of the receipts at plaintiff\u2019s circus, during the period covered by the broken contract. To prove this no other way seemed possible, then or now, and appellant has pointed to none, than by the calling of expert witnesses, who were familiar with the extent to which defendant was a drawing attraction, who were well acquainted with the character of plaintiff\u2019s business, and of the place or places where it was carried on. This opinion evidence is, of course, most unsatisfactory in character (Dawson v. Pittsburgh, 159 Pa. 317, 325), but defendant can hardly be heard to object to its use since he has not even suggested that there was another reasonable way open to plaintiff to prove the substantial damages it had suffered at his hands. At the first trial, for the reasons pointed out in our opinion, we decided that the testimony then given by the experts, was not sufficient to justify the acceptance of the opinions expressed by them, and we intimated therein in what respects the testimony was insufficient.\nAt this trial, the deficiencies in the previous evidence were properly covered, and, considering the testimony of each of the several experts as a whole, we are of opinion .that it justified the expression of their opinions, as to the loss plaintiff sustained by defendant\u2019s breach of his contract. That the jury gave a verdict for but a fraction of the sums fixed by the experts does not prove their evidence was inadmissible, but rather that the jury thereby disproved the fears defendant expressed as to the effect of receiving it. It would be a useless repetition to restate what we said before, and apply it to the facts of the case as developed on the present trial. As we have said, we are of opinion the evidence of the experts was admissible, and, this being so, admittedly it disposes of the principal, question raised on this appeal.\nThe second question alleged to be involved is this: \u201cIf irrelevant and collateral matter is elicited [by appellant], without objection, from plaintiff\u2019s witness on cross-examination, can the plaintiff rebut such collateral matter by the testimony of other witnesses?\u201d Appellant can hardly be heard to raise this question. The injection by it of the \u201cirrelevant and collateral matter\u201d into the case, left plaintiff but a single choice; it had either .to offer no evidence in answer to it, and thereby risk its possible effect on the jury, which it had no way of measuring ; or it could offer the rebutting evidence and take the risk of a reversal because of the doctrine now advanced by appellant. No court of justice should put a litigant to such an alternative; rather.it should permit him, by means of the contradictory evidence he had on hand, to rebut, as far as he could, the erroneous evidence elicited by his antagonist. Anything short of this would not even savor of fairness.\nThe third and final point involved is: \u201cIs it proper to instruct the jury that if any witness has wilfully and corruptly testified falsely to any material fact, the jury are at liberty to disregard the whole of his testimony, unless or except in so far as it is corroborated?\u201d This question, arises primarily out of an extract from the general charge as follows: \u201cThere is a maxim of the law as old as the law itself \u2014 falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus\u2014 that is, false in one thing, false in all things; and if you believe that any witness is testifying falsely to a matter that is material to the issue, it would be your province to disregard that witness\u2019s testimony in so far as he was not corroborated by some other credible witness, and this applies to all witnesses on both sides of the case.\u201d\nIt may be conceded that it would have been wiser if the court below had limited itself to the scope of the maxim as expressed by us in Com. v. Ieradi, 216 Pa. 87, 88, as follows: \u201cThe maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, has modernly been relaxed and restricted in its application. The rule is that if a witness wilfully and corruptly swears falsely to any material fact in a case, the jury are at liberty to disregard the whole of his testimony: 30 Am. & Eng. Ency. of Law, 2d edition, 1072. But the correct principle goes no further than to say that the jury may disregard the testimony, not that they must disregard it. This is the form of the rule as laid down in the great majority of jurisdictions: 2 Wigmore on Evidence, page 1173.\u201d\nWe are not concerned, however, with the question as to the best method of expressing the principle, but whether or not reversible error was committed in the way it was expressed. We are not convinced that it was. We do not feel that the effect of the charge was to tell the jury \u201cthat they must believe a false witness in so far as he is corroborated,\u201d yet that is the sole basis of complaint on the point. In what he said the trial judge was speaking of the \u201ctestimony,\u201d not of the witness. Plaintiff might, indeed, have had better ground to complain of that charge than had defendant. Under it the jury could have reached the conclusion that it must disregard the testimony of such a witness, save in so far as he was \u201ccorroborated by some other credible witness,\u201d merely because the jury believe he testified falsely as to some material matter, whereas the rule that they may disregard it does not apply unless the witness \u201cwilfully and corruptly\u201d swore falsely. Many witnesses swear falsely because of defect of memory or other cause not justifying the belief that they \u201cwilfully and corruptly\u201d do so. Moreover, the corroboration required by the charge is that of \u201csome other credible witness,\u201d that is of some witness whom the jury believe to be worthy of belief, for this is the meaning of \u201ccredible.\u201d Hence, the utmost that can be said is that the trial judge told the jury that it was their \u201cprovince to disregard the [false] witnesses testimony, in so far as he was not corroborated by some other......witness\u201d whom the jury were satisfied was worthy of belief. In other words, the part of the charge complained of related to testimony the jury might consider, because it is supported by the testimony of those whom they believed to be worthy of belief; it went no further. Thus viewed, it was not objectionable, for, in any event, the jury would believe the testimony, which they thought was worthy of belief no matter from whom it came.\nMoreover, we cannot properly consider the question at this time. Appellant, in his brief, says the rule was applicable to the testimony of three witnesses \u201cDale Kester and Mrs. Kester,\u201d and one \u201cDarnell,\u201d yet he has not printed the testimony of any of them, so that we might consider the force of the objection. As to the first two, appellant alleges that they said they \u201chad visited the defendant in Philadelphia on the evening when the alleged contract was supposed to have been made, and that they heard the defendant state that he had made a contract,\u201d whereas they \u201cwere contradicted by the records of their hotel registration in Philadelphia.\u201d As to the witness, Darnell, appellant says he \u201ctestified he was present in Philadelphia and heard the plaintiff and defendant in conversation the night of the alleged making of the contract,\u201d but that his \u201csubsequent statements to the contrary of this, were proved.\u201d Without this evidence in its proper setting, we cannot tell whether or not the jury would have been justified in finding that any of the witnesses was \u201cwilfully and corruptly\u201d testifying falsely. There is no presumption that they were, even if they were mistaken; and the fact that an error in dates may have been the only discrepancy, admonishes us that this not unusual mistake may have been far from showing wilful and corrupt testimony.\nThe same matter was raised in one of appellant\u2019s points, except that therein he properly qualified it with the words \u201cwilfully and corruptly,\u201d and the answer of the trial judge was the same as that above quoted from his general charge. In considering this point and answer, what we have said about the omission of the words \u201cwilfully and corruptly\u201d does not apply, but sufficient remains to cause us to dismiss the assignment of error.\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed."}
