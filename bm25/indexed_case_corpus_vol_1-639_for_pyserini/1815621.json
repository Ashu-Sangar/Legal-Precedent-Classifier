{"id": "1815621", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThe issue presented by this appeal is whether the reclassification of an employee\u2019s position to a class with a lower maximum rate of pay constitutes a demotion for purposes of the Civil Service Act, Act of August 5, 1941, P.L. 752, as amended, 71 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 741.1-741.1005. We hold that the reclassification of an employee\u2019s position which results in reassignment to a position in a class with a lower maximum pay rate without a reduction in pay is not a demotion under the Civil Service Act.\nAppellee James C. McHale was employed by the Appellant, the Department of Transportation (DOT), in a position classified as a Traffic Control Specialist Supervisor, which was designated as Pay Range 41. In October, 1983, DOT conducted a classification and organizational survey. By letter dated August 1, 1984, DOT advised McHale that the classification review of his position had determined that the current classification was inappropriate for his responsibilities. DOT indicated that reassignment was not possible because no position as a Traffic Control Specialist Supervisor was available and that McHale\u2019s position would be \u201creallocated downward\u201d to the Traffic Control Specialist, designated Pay Range 38, effective August 8, 1984. McHale was advised that he would retain his current salary.\nAfter receiving the notice of his reclassification, McHale filed an appeal request with the State Civil Service Commission. On the appeal request form, he indicated that he was appealing a demotion pursuant to section 951(a) of the Civil Service Act, 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.951(a), and on the basis of a discriminatory personnel action pursuant to section 951(b), 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.951(b). The Commission refused McHale\u2019s request for a hearing on December 13, 1984.\nOn appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision denying McHale a hearing under \u00a7 951(b) of the Civil Service Act, but vacated the Commission\u2019s decision denying him a hearing under \u00a7 951(a) of the Act. 100 Pa.Cmwlth. 148, 514 A.2d 290. The Commonwealth Court reasoned that McHale\u2019s reassignment was a demotion because the maximum salary for a Traffic Control Specialist Supervisor during the time when he was reassigned was higher than the maximum salary for a Traffic Control Specialist.\nDOT contends that the Commonwealth Court erred in ruling that a downward reclassification of a civil service position is appealable as a demotion to the Civil Service Commission and that the lower court\u2019s ruling conflicts with this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Office of Administration v. Orage, 511 Pa. 528, 515 A.2d 852 (1986).\nIn Orage, the issue raised was whether the Department of Transportation\u2019s refusal to reclassify an employee\u2019s job after a request to do so was an \u201cadjudication\u201d under the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq. The Commonwealth Court had held that civil service employees had property rights in having their jobs accurately classified and that adverse determinations in reclassification proceedings were agency adjudications appealable under the Administrative Agency Law. We reversed the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding, reasoning that because there is no per se right to government employment, no right exists to have a job designated by a particular classification in the absence of a specific legislative or contractual provision creating such a right. We determined that no such provision existed.\nDOT argues that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s ruling in the instant case is inconsistent with our decision in Orage. Unlike Orage, however, DOT acted affirmatively to reclassify Appellee\u2019s position to a class with a lower maximum salary. Based upon this distinction, the Appellee contends that a right to appeal a reclassification of his position to a class with a lower maximum salary exists under the Civil Service Act because the reclassification was a \u201cdemotion\u201d.\nThe Executive Board, consisting of the Governor and six gubernatorially designated heads of administrative departments, has the authority to establish different standards for different classes of similar work or service. 71 P.S. \u00a7 249(a)(2). The classification of positions is to conform to standards and rules adopted by the Executive Board. 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.707. In Orage, we noted that those legislative provisions did not contain any language granting employees enforceable property rights in the administration of the Commonwealth\u2019s classification system in comparison with other enumerated provisions of the Civil Service Act which clearly create enforceable rights.\nThe specific provisions of the Civil Service Act that the Appellee cites as creating a right of appeal are applicable to demotions. Appellee asserts that the reclassification of a position from one class to a different class with a lower maximum salary is a demotion. The Commonwealth Court accepted the Appellee\u2019s argument based solely upon the definition of demotion in \u00a7 3(r) of the Civil Service Act, 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.3(r).\nDemotion is defined therein as a change to a position in a class carrying a lower maximum salary. Without further analysis of the remaining provisions of the Civil Service Act, the conclusion that a reclassification of a position to a class with a lower maximum salary is superficially appealing. The definition of a term used specifically in the legislation does not stand alone, however; it must be read in the context of the act.\nThe provision of the Civil Service Act relating to demotions, 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.706, states:\nAn appointing authority may demote to a vacant position in a lower class any employe in the classified service who does not satisfactorily perform the duties of the position to which he was appointed or promoted and who is able to perform the duties of the lower class. In case of such demotion the employe shall have all rights of appeal as provided in this act. No employe shall be demoted because of his race, religion or political, partisan or labor union affiliation. A demotion may also be made by an appointing authority with the approval of the director upon the written petition of the employe stating the reasons therefor and supported by such evidence as the director may require to show that the employe is able to perform the duties of the class of position to which he petitions that he be demoted.\n(Emphasis added.) Pursuant to this provision, the right to appeal an appointing authority\u2019s action is limited to a demotion to a vacant position in a lower class of an employee who has not satisfactorily performed his current duties. The impetus for the change of position is critical, therefore, in determining whether a demotion has occurred which will trigger the right to appeal.\nIn the instant case, the change of the Appellee\u2019s position from one classified as a Traffic Control Specialist Supervisor to a position classified as a Traffic Control Specialist did not result from the Appellee\u2019s failure to satisfactorily perform his responsibilities. Instead, the change resulted from the revamping of the positions following a departmental review which disclosed that the current classifications were improper. Accordingly, the Appellee\u2019s reassignment to a position in a different class without a pay deduction was not a demotion which would trigger the right to appeal under \u00a7 951(a) of the Civil Service Act.\nSection 951(a) provides that a regular employee who has been subjected to a demotion is entitled to an appeal and hearing before the Civil Service Commission. As we stated in Orage, \u201cThese procedural rights are expressly provided in the cases of the aforementioned personnel actions, but not with respect to reclassification proceedings. Had the legislature wished to accord the same status to the reclassification of positions, it certainly would have expressly provided the same procedural protections.\u201d 511 Pa. at 533, 515 A.2d at 854. A reclassification of positions to recognize a change in duties or to correct an error made in the original classification is not a demotion affording an employee the procedural rights created by the Civil Service Act.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed insofar as it granted the Appellee\u2019s request for a hearing under \u00a7 951(a) of the Civil Service Act.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion."}
