{"id": "1745047", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Justice.\nAppellant was convicted of murder of the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. On direct appeal to this Court, the judgment of sentence was affirmed. Commonwealth v. Bundy, 458 Pa. 240, 328 A.2d 517 (1974). Appellant was represented by a member of the Public Defender\u2019s Office of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania during both of those proceedings. A post-conviction petition was filed by appellant and a hearing was held. During this proceeding appellant was represented by another member of the Public Defender\u2019s Office of Allegheny County. Among other allegations, appellant claimed in his post-conviction petition that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel at trial. Post-conviction relief was denied and an appeal nunc pro tunc was filed and granted by this Court. Thereafter post-conviction counsel was permitted to withdraw and an attorney independent of the Public Defender\u2019s Office was appointed to represent appellant in this appeal.\nAppellant now alleges that he was improperly represented by the public defender at his post-conviction hearing because of that counsel\u2019s failure to advise appellant of the apparent conflict of interest and possibility of prejudice present when an associate of an office argues the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel who was a member of the same office. Specifically appellant is contending that he was entitled to the aid and advice of independent counsel in pursuing the allegation of ineffective assistance during the post-conviction proceeding below. We agree.\nWe recently stated in Commonwealth v. Fox, 476 Pa. 475, 477, 383 A.2d 199, 200 (1978):\n\u201cWe have also held that a PCHA petitioner, represented by court-appointed counsel and alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel, may not be represented by an attorney from the office with which the allegedly ineffective attorney was associated. Commonwealth v. Sherard, 477 Pa. 430, 384 A.2d 234 (1977); Commonwealth v. Wright, 473 Pa. 398, 374 A.2d 1273 (1977); Commonwealth v. Via, supra.\u201d\nIn Fox we also stated that despite the conflict of interest, we would entertain the claim of ineffective counsel if reversible error is apparent on the record. However, we stressed that we would not reject such a claim without a remand for appointment of new counsel. Id. at 479, 383 A.2d at 201.\nIn Commonwealth v. Via, 455 Pa. 373, 316 A.2d 895, 898 (1974), we reasoned:\n\u201cWe will not view the failure to raise a claim of incompetency as a waiver where an individual in the subsequent proceeding is represented by the same counsel or one of his associates. The law will not assume that counsel has advised his clients of his inadequacies or those of his associates.\u201d\nThis reasoning would also force the conclusion that where counsel raises his own or his associates\u2019 inadequacy, we should not accept that appraisal as an objective view of counsel\u2019s stewardship. Even though associate counsel may make a good faith effort to critically review the record of the earlier proceeding, we cannot accept such an assessment \u00e1s an objective and detached evaluation of earlier counsel\u2019s stewardship. Fundamental fairness requires no less.\nThe Commonwealth urges that we not remand for another post-conviction hearing since appellant has new independent counsel on this appeal. Since an ineffective assistance of counsel challenge requires an examination of the basis for former counsel\u2019s course of action, Commonwealth v. White, 476 Pa. 350, 382 A.2d 1205 (1978); Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 559, 235 A.2d 349 (1967), an independent evidentiary hearing is frequently required to show that there was no reasonable basis for counsel\u2019s actions or failure to act in attempting to effectuate his client\u2019s best interest. Obviously, such an augmentation of the record cannot be accomplished before this Court. Thus, to accept the Commonwealth\u2019s position and refuse the requested remand would restrict appellant to a record created by an associate of the counsel whose competency is at issue. Such a result is obviously at variance with the reasoning announced in our cases. Commonwealth v. Fox, supra; Commonwealth v. Via, supra.\nThe matter is remanded to the Post Conviction Hearing Court for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness.\n. Our jurisdiction in this case is based on the Post Conviction Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. (1965) 1580, \u00a7 11, 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-11 (Supp. 1978-1979) and the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp. 1978-1979).\n. Appellant asserts he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial by that counsel\u2019s failure to protect appellant\u2019s right to arraignment without unnecessary delay, failure to interview appellant for a five month period until three days before trial and allowing possible witnesses to be lost by that delay, failure to amend appellant\u2019s self-prepared pre-trial motions, and failure to pursue on direct appeal the court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s request that the jury be allowed to view the scene which allegedly would have aided appellant in his contention of mistaken identity of appellant by a prosecution witness."}
