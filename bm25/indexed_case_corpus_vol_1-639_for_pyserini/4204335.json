The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n(1) Does the Superior Court\u2019s published decision overturning [respondent\u2019s] first-degree murder conviction on the basis of a supposedly defective accomplice liability instruction overlook and contradict this Court\u2019s precedent?\n(2) In the alternative, did the Superior Court contravene this Court\u2019s precedent by failing to modify the judgment to the lesser-included offense of second-degree murder, which was unaffected by the supposedly erroneous jury instruction?"}
