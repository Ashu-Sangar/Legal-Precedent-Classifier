{"id": "1740618", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nA jury convicted petitioner of burglary and conspiracy. The Superior Court, holding that both of petitioner\u2019s assignments of error had been waived, affirmed (Spaeth, J., joined by Cercone, J., dissenting). The only issue petitioner presents is whether he waived objections to the sentencing court\u2019s alleged consideration of arrests not resulting in convictions. See Commonwealth ex rel. Townsend v. Burke, 361 Pa. 35, 63 A.2d 77 (1949); cf. United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972) (sentencing court may not consider constitutionally invalid convictions); Del Piano v. United States, 575 F.2d 1066 (3rd Cir., 1978) (same).\nAt sentencing, the court had available a report containing petitioner\u2019s criminal record, which revealed eighteen adult arrests for various offenses resulting in nine convictions, and several juvenile dispositions. Petitioner alleges that he requested the court at the sentencing proceeding to disregard arrests not resulting in convictions but that the court expressed its belief that petitioner was guilty even in those instances not resulting in convictions and that therefore the court would consider all the arrests in imposing sentence. The record shows only the following:\n\u201c(Whereupon there was continued colloquy concerning the defendant\u2019s criminal extract.)\u201d\nIt is unclear whether the discussion was not transcribed or whether transcription of the conference has been lost.\nWe recently reaffirmed that where appellate review of assignments of error is rendered impossible because the transcript is unavailable through no fault of the defendant, the disposition in question must be vacated and remanded for proceedings of record. See Commonwealth v. Shields, 477 Pa. 105, 383 A.2d 844 (1978); Commonwealth v. Goldsmith, 452 Pa. 22, 304 A.2d 478 (1973); Commonwealth v. Norman, 447 Pa. 515, 291 A.2d 112 (1972); Commonwealth v. DeSimone, 447 Pa. 380, 290 A.2d 93 (1972); Commonwealth v. Anderson, 441 Pa. 483, 272 A.2d 877 (1971). This principle is particularly important with respect to sentencing in light of our recent decisions directing the sentencing court, on the record, to place reasons for the sentence imposed. See Commonwealth v. Kostka, 475 Pa. 85, 379 A.2d 884 (1977); Commonwealth v. Riggins, 474 Pa. 115, 377 A.2d 140 (1977) (plurality opinion); cf. Commonwealth v. Martin, 466 Pa. 118, 351 A.2d 650 (1976) (sentencing court must consider defendant\u2019s background, individual characteristics, relative culpability and prospects for rehabilitation); see generally ABA Standards Relating to Appellate Review of Sentences \u00a7 2.3 (Approved Draft, 1968).\nBecause the necessary portion of the transcript is missing, this Court cannot determine whether petitioner\u2019s claim has been preserved and, if so, whether it has merit. See Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974) (timely objection during proceeding required to preserve issue for appellate review). We therefore grant petitioner\u2019s request for allowance of appeal, vacate judgment of sentence and remand for a new sentencing hearing of record.\nJudgment vacated and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n. The Commonwealth has submitted a letter from the court reporter averring that one box of transcripts from petitioner\u2019s trial cannot be located.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204 (Supp.1977)."}
