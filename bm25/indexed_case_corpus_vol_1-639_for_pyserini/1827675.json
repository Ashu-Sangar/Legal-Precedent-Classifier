{"id": "1827675", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThe issue presented in this case is whether an employee injured in a work-related auto accident may recover both worker\u2019s compensation benefits and uninsured motorist benefits from his employer.\nOn November 19, 1984, William Lemon and Walter DeWitt, police officers for the City of Philadelphia, were injured when the police car in which they were riding was struck from behind by an uninsured motorist. The officers were acting within the scope of their duties when the accident occurred. It is undisputed that Philadelphia qualifies as a self-insurer under the Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Act, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1787.\nThe Court of Common Pleas granted summary judgment in favor of the City. Superior Court affirmed. This court initially denied appellants\u2019 Petition for Allowance of Appeal, and then, on application for reconsideration, we granted the petition on the grounds that the issue presented is the same as that addressed in Hackenberg v. SEPTA.\nIn Hackenberg, 526 Pa. 358, 586 A.2d 879 (1991) we held that on the facts of a case analytically indistinguishable from this case, Lemon and DeWitt would not be entitled to recover both worker\u2019s compensation benefits and uninsured motorist coverage from their employer. Accordingly, the Judgment of Superior Court is affirmed.\nCAPPY, J., files a dissenting opinion in which LARSEN and PAPADAKOS, JJ., join."}
