Grant, appeals from the per curiam order of the Commonwealth Court quashing his appeal from the denials of his applications to proceed in forma pauperis. We reverse.\nOn June 8, 2003, appellant, a prisoner at the SCI Waynesburg, filed a prison condition litigation action, seeking to proceed informa pauperis. The trial court denied appellant\u2019s request, citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6602(a)(2)(ii), finding the average monthly deposits to his prison account exceeded the filing fee.\nAppellant filed an appeal with the Commonwealth Court, which entered a per curiam order quashing the notice and amended notices of appeal, stating the denial of in forma pauperis status is not appealable. See Grant v. Blaine, et al., No. 1630 CD 2003, unpublished order (Pa.Cmwlth. filed July 31, 2003). We granted review to consider the propriety of such order.\nAppellant contends the Commonwealth Court erred in quashing his appeal. Specifically, he contends an order denying in forma pauperis status is a final, appealable order because it has the practical consequence of putting him out of court.\nIn Pugar v. Greco, 483 Pa. 68, 394 A.2d 542 (1978), this Court addressed the finality of orders:\nIt is, of course, well settled that an appeal will lie only from a final order unless otherwise permitted by statute. A final order is one which usually ends the litigation, or alternatively, disposes of the entire case. In determining what constitutes a final order ... we look to \u201ca practical rather than technical construction\u201d of an order.... \u201cWhether an order is final and appealable cannot necessarily be ascertained from the face of a decree alone, nor simply from the technical effect of the adjudication. The finality of an order is a judicial conclusion which can be reached only after an examination of its ramifications.\u201d We have also said that if the practical consequence of the order by the trial court is effectively to put an appellant \u201cout of court\u201d the order will be treated as final. Similarly, an order is \u201cfinal\u201d if it precludes a party from presenting the merits of his claim to the lower court.\nId., at 544-45 (internal citations and footnote omitted).\nDespite the order herein, both the Superior and Commonwealth Courts have previously reviewed denials of in forma pauperis status. See Harry v. Lehigh Valley Hosp., 825 A.2d 1281 (Pa.Super.2003) (order denying informa pauperis status appealable); Crosby Square Apts. v. Henson, 446 Pa.Super. 286, 666 A.2d 737 (1995) (order denying in forma pauperis status final and appealable); Banks v. Ryan, 124 Pa.Cmwlth. 603, 556 A.2d 950 (1989) (same); Koziatek v. Marquett, 335 Pa.Super. 482, 484 A.2d 806 (1984) (same); Sellers v. Sellers, 293 Pa.Super. 265, 438 A.2d 986 (1981) (appeal from denial in part of in forma pauperis status properly before court).\nIn Roberts v. United States Dist. Court, 339 U.S. 844, 70 S.Ct. 954, 94 L.Ed. 1326 (1950) (per curiam), petitioner, a prisoner, filed a petition for a writ of injunction, seeking to proceed in forma pauperis. Id., at 844, 70 S.Ct. 954. The United States Supreme Court held a District Judge\u2019s denial of the right to proceed in forma pauperis is immediately appeal-able. Id. (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291; Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949)); see also Deutsch v. United States, 67 F.3d 1080, 1083 (3d Cir.1995) (order denying informa pauperis status appeal-able \u201cbecause an in forma pauperis plaintiff must be afforded appellate review of a determination that he is required to pay all or a portion of the court costs and filing fees to file a claim....\u201d); Sinwell v. Shapp, 536 F.2d 15 (3d Cir.1976) (order denying motion to proceed in forma pauperis appeal-able).\nAlthough we are not bound by these decisions, we find them persuasive. Appellant was denied the ability to proceed in forma pauperis; this ruling denied him the filing of his prison litigation action. If such denial were not immediately appeal-able, appellant would be left without remedy should the trial court have been in error.\nDenial of this status to one who does not qualify does not improperly deny access to the courts; conversely, improper denial of status is improper denial of access. A litigant who is denied the ability to bring a cause of action due to his true inability to pay the costs is effectively put out of court. Because such a denial may close the courthouse door to litigants, they must be permitted to appeal the denial of in forma pauperis status. In accordance with this Court\u2019s analysis in Pugar, looking at the trial court\u2019s order, and determining \u201cthe practical consequence ... is effectively to put an appellant \u2018out of court\u2019,\u201d id., at 544-45, we hold an order denying in forma pauperis status is a final, appealable order.\nThe Commonwealth Court erred in quashing appellant\u2019s appeal from the denial of informa pauperis status.\nOrder reversed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\n. A prisoner seeking to bring prison conditions litigation without the prepayment of fees or security due to indigency must submit a request to the court to proceed without the prepayment of fees. The request must include a certified copy of the prisoner\u2019s prison account statement, which shall be provided by the prison, for the six-month period immediately preceding the filing of the complaint or notice of appeal. The request shall include a statement of any other assets of the prisoner.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6602(a)(1).\nThe court shall deny in forma pauperis status to any prisoner where: (ii) the average monthly deposits or average highest monthly balance for the six-month period preceding the filing of the action exceeds the amount of the filing fee____\nId., \u00a7 6602(a)(2)(ii).\n. Appellees did not file a brief."}
