{"id": "1204561", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nAfter the decision in Crozer\u2019s Estate, 337 Pa. 327, 10 A. 2d 429, next of kin filed this petition for the termination of the trust and for distribution to petitioners on the theory that the award to the trustees, finally confirmed March 31, 1921, was erroneously made and that, in consequence of the alleged error, next of kin are now entitled to receive the property. We held on the former appeal,' to which reference may be made for the facts, that review of the adjudication of 1921 was barred by section 48 of the Fiduciaries\u2019 Act of 1917, P. L. 447, 20 PS \u00a7 843.\nPetitioners now renew their contention that a subscribing witness to the will was not disinterested, that the trust was therefore void, and that the objection may now be made notwithstanding the award of the fund to the trustees in 1921 for the purposes of carrying out the trust. On the other hand, the trustees contend that the. witness was disinterested and that, while they would have been able in 1921 to show the fact, the point is not now open to reexamination.\nThe rule in our cases is that the time to challenge the validity of a charitable bequest is on the distribution of the estate: Hickman\u2019s Estate, 308 Pa. 230, and cases cited, p. 236. This distribution occurred in 1921. The case now stands as if, at the time of the proposed distribution in 1921, the validity of the trust had been unsuccessfully challenged on the ground now urged: compare Bower\u2019s Estate, 240 Pa. 388, 87 A. 711; Havin\u2019s Estate, 283 Pa. 292, 129 A. 101; Pyles v. Bosler, 313 Pa. 548, 551, 170 A. 897. In appellant\u2019s brief it is said: \u201cThe present petition of the next of kin prays for the termination of the colorable trust created by the above award on the ground that the Substituted Trustees cannot use the fund cy pres because, under section 6 of the Wills Act, there never was a valid charita ble bequest \u201d The statement that \u201cthere never was a valid charitable bequest\u201d must be rejected as contrary to the legal effect required by the doctrine of res adjudicata to be given to the record. The consequence is that the next of kin have no interest which would support their petition: see Wilhey\u2019s Estate, 337 Pa. 129, at pp. 134, 135, 10 A. 2d 425, a case referred to in disposing of the former appeal.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.\nReferring to Stinson\u2019s Estate, 232 Pa. 218, 81 A. 207; Arnold\u2019s Estate, 249 Pa. 348, 94 A. 1076; Palethorp\u2019s Estate, 249 Pa. 389, 94 A. 1060.\nReferring to Kessler\u2019s Estate, 221 Pa. 314, 70 A. 770; Channon\u2019s Estate, 266 Pa. 417, 109 A. 756; Baughman\u2019s Estate, 281 Pa. 23, 126 A. 58; Gageby\u2019s Estate, 293 Pa. 109, 141 A. 842."}
