{"id": "1263053", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Jones,\nThe plaintiff company sued in assumpsit to recover, under count 1, for the defendant\u2019s failure to pay for goods sold and delivered, consisting of a certain quantity of Insecticide Lamps and, under count 2, for a loss of profits due allegedly to the defendant\u2019s breach of a written contract for the purchase and sale* of 1, 000,000 Insecticide Lanips. -\nThe case was tried to the court without a jury. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant moved for a compulsory nonsuit. A recess for lunch was taken without any ruling by the trial judge on the defendant\u2019s motion. Upon resumption of the trial and before any action by the court on the motion for nonsuit, counsel for defendant rested and presented a request for a directed verdict which the learned trial judge did not then act upon but granted the defendant\u2019s motion for nonsuit. In accordance with a local rule' of courts the plaintiff, within the time limited therefor, filed exceptions which the court subsequently dismissed and entered judgment 'for the defendant. - We are persuaded from o\u00far examination of the record that the correct result was reached by the learned court belowT-'The judgment will be affirmed on the following excerpts from the opinion of Judge Watebs which adequately answer the appellant\u2019s contentions.\n\u201cConsidering first count II, the plaintiff\u2019s claim is based on a writing of which a photostatic copy was offered as plaintiff\u2019s exhibit number 4. This writing appears to be an order form of the plaintiff, on which the printed name and address of the plaintiff have been obliterated and the name and address of the defend-. ant inserted in typewriting. It is addressed to Solar Electric Corporation, the plaintiff, is marked 'Order No. 43260,\u2019 and calls for 1,000,000 60w ST19B1 Insecticide Lamps.. It carries in typewriting the statement, \u2018This order is subject to a cancellation charge in event of a cancellation by us,\u2019 followed by a signature said to be that of Philip Rochlin. The order is undated but bears a rubber stamp purporting to show that it was received by the plaintiff on June 15,1953.\n\u201cThe plaintiff contends that one. shipment of. 5,040 lamps was made to the defendant under this order on July 29,1953, but that no further shipments were made because of the defendant\u2019s failure to make payment for this and earlier deliveries of merchandise. .\n\u201cWe need not consider whether this writing constituted a valid contract between the plaintiff and the defendant or whether the defendant breached- the contract because we have concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s proof of damages was wholly inadequate. The plaintiff\u2019s only witness was its treasurer, and, his. testimony on the subject of damages was confined to, the reading of portions of a letter alleged to have been written by the plaintiff\u2019s general manager to the defendant setting forth an \u2018inventory of Exterminator raw material and finished lamps,\u2019 a copy of which is attached to the complaint as exhibit \u2018C\u2019.. The witness\u2019s testimony lacked the detail and personal knowledge of the transactions necessary to establish a claim for damages chargeable against the defendant for breach of contract.\n\u201cIt is true that where there is a basis in. the, evidence for a reasonable computation of the damages suffered, considering the nature of the transaction, a verdict may be based thereon,. though there may be involved some uncertainty about it: Weinglass v. Gibson, 304 Pa. 203 (1931); nevertheless, where damages are susceptible of being proved the amount must be established with certainty: Forrest v. Buchanan, 203 Pa. 454 (1902). The evidence of damages submitted in the instant case is so vague and indefinite that any award based thereon would be mere speculation and conjecture.\n\u201cTo support its claim under count I' of the complaint, the plaintiff rested on its books Of account purporting to show an indebtedness by the defendant to it\" of\u2019 $27,405.02, citing the authority of Clifford v. Hicks, 95 Pa. Superior Ct. 182 (1929) and other eases for the proposition that the book account is self-sustaining, \"and is prima facie evidence of the sale and delivery of the articles and of their prices.\u2019 This claim, however, does- hot appear to be one arising out of a transaction which would be susceptible of proof by such book: account alone. The testimony of the' plaintiffs witness indicated not only that the prices were agreed upon in advance but that the shipments alleged to have been made were made in pursuance of a bulk order for future delivery. In fact, most of the invoices offered to support the book entries bear the legend \u2018Your Order No. 43252-4/16,\u2019 and one invoice bears the legend \u2018Your Order No. 5260-6/5/53,\u2019 which appears to be the purported order for 1,000,000 lamps which formed the basis of plaintiff\u2019s elaim in count II.\n'\u2018The defendant contends that the records offered at the trial do not in fact represent the plaintiff\u2019s books of original entry. We do not feel that we need decide this question, because we ar\u00e9 convinced that th\u00e9 trial judge was correct in holding that, in a case such as this, the plaintiff is required to show more than the mere entry Of items of accounts receivable in Order to prove the defendant\u2019s liability.' The plaintiff\u2019s argumerit'based on Clifford v. Hicks, supra, overlooks the necessity' theory upon which the evidence of book accounts has -been received by the courts as an exception to1 the1 hearsay rul\u00e9,'and the line Of cases holding that where a special contract is sought to be established or where the amount involved or the goods delivered are of such large proportions as to make it obvious that Other and more satisfactory proof is available, the book account may not be relied upon. \u2018The early cases are full of expressions that such evidence [of book accounts] is received only from necessity and .that the custom to which such necessity gave rise extended only to goods sold and labor performed; that.it was exceptional and dangerous in character and would not be -extended: Fulton\u2019s Estate, 178 Pa. 78, 87, 35 A. 880. It has been held . . . that they are not admissibl\u00e9 to prove delivery of goods pursuant to a previous contract: Hall & Co. v. Woolen Co., 187 Pa. 18, 22, 40 A. 986; Lonergan v. Whitehead, 10 Watts 249.\u2019 Pringle v. Neff, 112 Pa. Superior Ct. 547, 549 (1934). And, as stated by President Judge Trexler in Crew Levick Co. v. Gibbon, 115 Pa. Superior Ct. 595 (1935), citing the same cases, the plaintiff \u2018cannot rely upon the presumption of purchase and delivery attached to the books' of original entry and the implied promise to pay. Where there is a special agreement the transaction is taken out of the usual course of buying and; selling . . .' Books of original entry are not admissible to prove \u25a0 delivery of goods pursuant to a previous contract.\u2019 \u201d\nJudgment affirmed. \u2022"}
