{"id": "1927799", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Cohen,\nIt is clear that plaintiff, appellant, is not asserting that appellee caused her physical injuries but rather that appellee caused her financial harm by not obtaining the name or license number of the driver whose car struck the cab from the rear. As there are no prior cases on this particular subject, appellant would have this Court create and impose on cab companies the duty to obtain sufficient information about individuals involved in traffic accidents with cabs to. enable cab passengers at least to know against whom to bring suit.\nCommon law courts have been reluctant to impose affirmative duties on individuals even in situations in which most people would feel under a moral obligation to act. The Restatement (Second), Torts, \u00a7314 (1965) states that as long as the actor\u2019s conduct has not placed another in peril \u201c[t]he fact that the actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another\u2019s aid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action.\u201d This Court, in Yania v. Bigan, 397 Pa. 316, 321-2, 155 A. 2d 343, 346 (1959), stated: \u201cLastly, it is urged that Bigan failed to take the necessary steps to rescue Yania from the water. The mere fact that Bigan saw Yania in a position of peril in the water imposed upon him no legal, although a moral, obligation or duty to go to his rescue unless Bigan was legally responsible, in whole or in part, for placing Yania in the perilous position.\u201d Behind this is the \u201crugged individualism\u201d approach of the common law and \u201cthe feeling that it is a more serious restraint on personal freedom to require a person to act than it is to place limits on his liberty to act.\u201d McNiece and Thornton, Affirmative Duties in Tort. 58 Yale L. J. 1272, 1288 (1949).\nIn recent years, however, there have been attempt\u00bb to mitigate the harshness of this rule. Usually the basis for the departure from the general rule has been the existence of a special relationship between the parties which, it is felt, is sufficient to transform the moral duty into a legal one. 2 Harper and James, The Law of Torts, \u00a718.6 at 1048 (1956); Note, Good Samaritans and Liability for Medical Malpractice, 64 Col. L. Rev. 1301, 1316 (1964). Thus, as to common carriers, the Restatement (Second), Torts, \u00a7314A (1965) states \u201cA common carrier is under a duty to its passengers to take reasonable action (a) to protect them against unreasonable risk of physical harm, and (b) to give them first aid after it knows or has reason to know that they are ill or injured, and to care for them until they can be cared for by others.\u201d Case law gives support to that position. Yazoo & M.V.R.R. v. Byrd, 89 Miss. 308, 42 So. 286 (1906); Korn v. Tamiami Trail Tours, Inc., 108 Ga. App. 510, 133 S.E. 2d 616 (1963).\nIt must be noted, however, that this imposition of legal duty only applies to the physical well-being of the passenger. Appellant does not contend that appellee refused to offer assistance after she suffered her injuries. Rather, she states that appellee did not act to protect her financial interests. This is a step towards making a common carrier the guardian of all its passengers\u2019 interests that no court has yet taken. \u201cThe courts seem to have been somewhat more willing to impose liability on this basis when there has been physical injury to persons or property than where the injury is to the interest in financial advantage.\u201d 2 Harper and James, supra, \u00a718.6, n. 7 at 1046. The interest in the passenger\u2019s physical well-being is sufficiently important to require the carrier to act to protect it even when the injury is no fault of the carrier\u2019s. The interest in the passenger\u2019s financial well-being, however, seems of a much lesser magnitude and not of sufficient weight to overcome the traditional judicial reluctance to impose affirmative duties. This is true at least where the carrier is not responsible for placing the passenger in the original position of peril. An individual\u2019s financial interests can be so complex and varied that we should not require the carrier to be cognizant of them and responsible for furthering and protecting them.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell, Mr. Justice Eagen, and Mr. Justice Pomeroy join in this opinion.\nThe dissenting opinion, while imposing a burden on appeUee, makes no distinction between the passenger\u2019s physical well-being and financial interests.\nWhile the Act of April 29, 1959, P. L. 58, \u00a71217, as amended June 2, 1985, P. L. 93, \u00a71, 75 P.S. \u00a71217, does require the operator of a motor vehicle involved in an accident resulting in bodily injury to file a report of the accident with the Department of Motor Vehicles, this is a duty that runs to the Commonwealth and not to any ixarticular individual. The penalty for violating that section is a fine of $10 or a maximum of five days in prison. The dissent would have us transform that duty to one in favor of any person injured in the accident and impose as a penalty for noncompliance not the nominal fine of $10 but the total amount of damages suffered by that individual. Thus, we would be imposing an affirmative duty in the sense of imposing a much more serious sanction for failure to act than the statute imposes."}
