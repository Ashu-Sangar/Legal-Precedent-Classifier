{"id": "848223", "contents": "Pen Curiam,\nThe defendants, Thomas Wasson and Martha Wasson, were sued as husband and wife; and, as shown by the justice\u2019s transcript, the only evidence in support of plaintiff\u2019s claim was a contract signed by the husband alone. This, without more, was insufficient to support a judgment against the wife, and hence there was no error in striking off the judgment as to her.\nOrder striking off the judgment against Martha Wasson affirmed, and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant,"}
