{"id": "1294504", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nThe defendant, Samuel Lawrence Woodhouse, Jr., shot and killed his sixteen year old adopted daughter, Elizabeth Love Woodhouse, who had suffered from Yon Recklinghausen\u2019s disease from an early age. He was indicted and tried for her murder. The jury adjudged him guilty of murder in the first degree and fixed the punishment at life imprisonment. From the conviction, he appeals.\nThe defendant was born October 16, 1904, and became engaged in the general practice of medicine about the year 1932. On August 6, 1953, while his wife and mother were away from his home for the day, he went to the daughter\u2019s bedroom on the third floor and found her sleeping in bed. Having assured himself that she was asleep, he went downstairs to his drug room on the first floor, took four shells from a box of twenty-twos, returned to the third floor and inserted the four shells in the clip of a bolt action .22 rifle. He aimed the gun at the back of his sleeping daughter\u2019s head. The shot misfired. He went to the second floor to secure something to aid in removing the misfired cartridge. He reloaded the rifle, returned to his daughter\u2019s bedroom, and fired one shot into the back of her head. He placed her on the floor and folded her arms over her chest. He wiped the blood from the floor, replaced the two remaining shells in the box, and threw the discharged shell and the one that misfired into a creek located to the rear of the property. Then he treated two patients in the office of his home, one for poison ivy, the other for a puncture wound. He paid a young man for cutting the lawn. Sometime later, he checked his daughter\u2019s condition and, finding her still alive and breathing, injected two doses of 5 cc of methadone into her body to hasten death and alleviate suffering. He also injected a total of 25 ce of the same drug into his own body, intending to commit suicide. When his wife and mother returned home late in the afternoon, they found Betsy dead on the floor of her bedroom and the defendant draped over a swivel chair in his office. A local doctor was called, who administered first aid to the defendant and arranged his transfer, by ambulance, to a hospital. The State Police were summoned. At the hospital, defendant\u2019s attorney advised him against making any statement to the police.\nOn August 12th, the defendant was discharged from the hospital; and, with his attorney present at all times, the investigating officers were given their first opportunity to question him. He was taken to his home and he re-enacted the events of August 6th as, he said, they happened. His statements were steno-graphically recorded. Among other things, he said that he had been having trouble with his daughter for sometime as far as obedience was concerned. He also stated that \u201cthe plans to take Betsy\u2019s life had been in my mind for a year or more and when my mother went with my wife, I realized here was my opportunity.\u201d\nOn February IS, 1954, upon petition of defendant\u2019s counsel, the court appointed a commission (under the provisions of the Mental Health Act of July 11, 1923, as amended, 50 PS \u00a71224), to inquire into the defendant\u2019s mental condition. After hearings, the commission concluded that the defendant was mentally ill and recommended that he be institutionalized. On February 25, 1954, by court order, he was committed to the Farview State Hospital for the criminal insane. On September 29, 1955, Dr. John P. Shovlin, superintendent of this institution asked for the defendant\u2019s discharge therefrom stating that \u201clie had sufficiently recovered ... to no longer need custodial care and remedial treatment.\u201d By agreement of defendant\u2019s counsel and the district attorney, the defendant\u2019s transfer to the county jail was deferred. On December 29, 1955, a supplemental petition was presented to the court as a result of which the defendant was ordered transferred to the Harrisburg State Hospital. One year and three months later, the superintendent of this hospital petitioned for his release on the ground that he had fully recovered. The trial began May 6, 1957.\nThe defendant did not take the stand on his own behalf at the trial. The only defense offered was insanity. His wife testified that the defendant appeared tired and worried about himself for several months before the day involved; that his daughter\u2019s disease gave him great concern and that she presented a personality problem which added to his worries; that he frequently indicated an intention to commit suicide; and, that he imbibed intoxicants freely. Other lay Avitnesses called by the defense testified that for at least a year before the shooting noticeable changes were apparent in the defendant, manifesting signs of unhappiness, irritability, moroseness, lack of memory and a Avorried attitude about his own health, that of his daughter, and her anti-social attitude.\nThe defense also introduced the testimony of three members of the medical profession, who for years had specialized in the science and practice of psychiatry. One of these experts first examined the defendant a little more than three months after the tragedy. He testified that, in his opinion, the defendant at the time of the killing and for sometime previous was suffering from a paranoid involutional psychosis or insanity, and that the defendant acted, at the time involved, under the delusions that he himself was suffering from a hopeless illness and that his daughter was disintegrating both physically and mentally. These delusions, he said, prevented the defendant from completely appreciating the quality of his act, when he killed his daughter.\nAnother such expert, who first examined the defendant two months and ten days after the killing, opined that, at the time in question and for two years previously, the defendant had suffered from a severe psychosis; that the mental illness came Avith the defendant\u2019s change of life and Avas accompanied by serious delusions. He further expressed the belief that, Avhile the defendant had some aAvareness that the act of killing Avas wrong, his insanity Avas so strong and his judgment so clouded that in his mind the act had to be done regardless.\nThe third such Avitness Avas a medical member of the commission, Avho examined the defendant approximately six and one-lialf months following the commission of the crime. His diagnosis that the defendant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia differed from that of the two experts mentioned aboA\u2019e. He stated, however, that in his opinion the defendant had been mentally ill for more than a year before the day he first examined him and that, during this period, he did not appreciate the complete quality of his actions and that, due to delusions from which he suffered, at times the defendant failed to knoAv the difference betAveen right and wrong.\nAll three psychiatrists expressed surprise at the defendant\u2019s rapid recovery. During their previous medical examinations, they definitely concluded the prognosis was very poor.\nIn rebuttal, the Commonwealth called lay witnesses, who had excellent opportunities to talk with and observe the defendant within a short period folloAving the shooting. Tavo saAV him in his office almost immediately after the unfortunate occurrence. They testified that the defendant appeared calm and rational and that there Avas nothing in his speech, manner or conduct indicating any abnormality or mental disturbance.\nThe trial judge permitted defense counsel great latitude of proof to sustain the insanity plea. All evidence relevant to the defendant\u2019s mental condition Avas admitted. The psychiatrists were permitted to explain their conclusions in their oavii terms and in complete freedom. In a very comprehensive charge, the court carefully and fairly defined the issues and explained to the jury the significance of the defense of insanity, its import and ramifications. The trial judge charged in part: \u201cIn all crimes Avhere the defense of insanity is set forth, the defendant must sIioav the crime committed Avas the result of that insanity. In other words, there must be some relation betAveen the insane delusions he may have and the crime he commits. It is not enough to prove, to escape the consequences of his act, that he has some mental infirmity, some disease of the mind. He must go further and sIioav that this disease of the mind is such as to render him incapable of knoAving Avhat he Avas doing, or if he did know what he Avas doing, the disease of the mind made him unable to judge that Avhat he did was Avrong. ... If the defendant although as alleged, labored under insanity at the time of the shooting, understood the nature of Ms act, then and there had knowledge that it was wrong and had mental power sufficient to apply that knowledge to his oavu case and knew if he did act he would do Avrong and receive punishment, he Avould be responsible.\u201d\nThe jury, as indicated before, rejected the defense and found the defendant criminally responsible.\nIn support of the request for a neAv trial, defendant\u2019s counsel urge in strong and able fashion that the rule of laAV giAren to the jury by the trial judge in this case in regard to the legal test of responsibility, where the defense is insanity, Avas prejudicial error. It is urged that the rule laid down in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s case and folloAved in this trial is unsound, confusing, antiquated and based on notions of mental disorders which are discredited by modern science. It is submitted that Pennsylvania should adopt the broad version of the \u201cIrresistible Impulse\u201d test and that the trial judge erred in not charging the jury in these terms.\nInsanity did not become a defense in England until the beginning of the fourteenth century. And, until the seventeenth century, the authorities on the subject Avere so very general in terms as to be of little concrete value. As a result of great public interest in a trial involving a killing perpetrated by one Daniel M\u2019Naghten, The Queen v. M\u2019Naghten, 10 Cl. & Fin. 200, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843), a debate ensued in the House of Lords, concerning the status of the laAV in regard to the question of the unsoundness of mind Avhicli Avould excuse the commission of a felony. As a result, five questions Avere submitted to the fifteen judges of England regarding the existing laAV of insanity. The an-SAvers of the judges gave being to the noAV long famous \u201cM\u2019Naghten Rule,\u201d namely, that \u201cto establish a defense on the ground of insanity, it must be clearly proved tliat, at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from the disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.\u201d The judges, who formulated this rule, did not consider it as an innovation, but rather, as a restatement of the law long in vogue in England as well as in this country.\nShortly thereafter, this rule was adopted as the law in Pennsylvania (Commonwealth v. Hosier, 4 Pa. 264 (1846)), and has become firmly established and imbedded in the body of the law of this Commonwealth ever since: Commonwealth v. Calhoun, 238 Pa. 474, 86 Atl. 472 (1913) ; Commonwealth v. Szachewicz, 303 Pa. 410, 154 Atl. 483 (1931) ; Commonwealth v. Lockard, 325 Pa. 56, 188 Atl. 755 (1937) ; Commonwealth v. Neill, 362 Pa. 507, 67 A. 2d 276 (1949); Commonwealth v. Heller, 369 Pa. 457, 87 A. 2d 287 (1952); Commonwealth v. Moon, 383 Pa. 18, 117 A. 2d 96 (1955) ; Commonwealth v. Carluceetti, 369 Pa. 190, 85 A. 2d 391 (1952) ; Commonwealth v. Lance, 381 Pa. 293, 113 A. 2d 290 (1955) ; Commonwealth v. Patskin, 375 Pa. 368, 100 A. 2d 472 (1953) ; Commonwealth v. Novak, 395 Pa. 199, 150 A. 2d 102 (1959).\nIt has been stated, reiterated and reaffirmed again and again. In Commonwealth v. Neill (1949), supra, Mr. Justice Horace Stern, later Chief Justice, speaking for a unanimous court, said at 514: \u201c. . . insanity within the legal meaning of that term, [is] inability, from disease of the mind, to understand the nature and quality of the act and to distinguish between right and wrong with respect to it.\u201d\nIn Commonwealth v. Heller (1952), supra, the same Justice again speaking for a unanimous court, said at 461: \u201cAll this testimony, [of the same psychiatrist, that defendant was acutely mentally ill at the time of the killing], viewed as an entirety, falls considerably short of an unambiguous opinion that at the time of the homicide defendant did not understand the nature and quality of his act or the difference between right and wrong, which is the legal test for a finding of insanity that would excuse the perpetrator of a homicide from criminal responsibility.\u201d\nAs late as March 16, 1959, Mr. Justice Bell speaking for this Court, said: \u201cDefendant, as other defendants repeatedly have, asks us to reject or change the rule laid down in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s Case, 8 Eng. Rep. 718, which was adopted as the law of Pennsylvania in Commonwealth v. Mosler, 4 Pa. 264. These cases established the so-called \u2018right and wrong\u2019 test for insanity, when insanity is raised as a defense by a defendant. Defendant desires us to adopt some undefined psychiatric test. Once more, we refuse to do so. The M\u2019Naghten case rule or \u2018the right and wrong test\u2019 has been repeatedly reaffirmed by this Court. . . .\u201d: Commonwealth v. Novak, supra, at 210.\nIf any rule of law is founded on long established precedent in Pennsylvania, this is it.\nIt is the rule religiously followed in England today. The same is true in Canada. In at least twenty-nine states of the Union, it is still the only test and in some others, while it is still the main test, it is supplemented by the so-called \u201cIrresistible Impulse\u201d test. One state, New Hampshire, and the District of Columbia have rejected both of thess tests and have adopted what is known as the \u201cDurham Rule.\u201d See Durham v. United States, 214 F. 2d 862 (D.C. Cir. 1954).\nThe \u201cright and wrong\u201d test of M\u2019Naghten\u2019s case has been extensively censured by psychiatrists, law school professors and law review writers for many years. Some judges have also voiced caustic criticism. This criticism reached its peak in this country in the present century as a phase of the rise of psychoanalysis. See, Weihofen, \u201cMental Disorder As A Criminal Defense\u201d; Roche, \u201cThe Criminal Mind\u201d; Biggs, \u201cThe Guilty Mind\u201d; Zilboorg, \u201cMind, Medicine And Man\u201d. Some critics advocate the adoption of the \u201cIrresistible Impulse\u201d rule as the guiding test for criminal responsibility in such cases; others favor the application of the Durham rule; still others argue that all named tests are inadequate and that, it is thoroughly illogical to entrust the determination of the issue of insanity to laymen; that only experts are qualified to decide this question. Some urge a fresh and completely new approach to the entire problem. It is suggested that we reformulate our laws of penology so that they are no longer focused on punishment as the normal consequence of crime, with other dispositions taking their place as exceptions to the rule; and to allow for three alternate dispositions of the criminal, principally of equal penological rank, viz., punishment, custody and therapy. It is argued that under such a system, the court, after determining the facts of the case, could proceed to a consideration of the way in which the offender should best be dealt with from the point of view of the merits of the case, the requirements of public morality and public safety, and the chances of the offenders\u2019 rehabilitation; and could dispose of each case by punishment, by custody or treatment, or by a combination of all of them.\nShould the M\u2019Nagliten Rule be abolished in Pennsylvania? Our answer is \u201cno\u201d for very compelling reasons. Unquestionably, in a republican form of government as we are privileged to enjoy, order, certainty and stability in the law are essential for the safety and protection of all. Stare Decisis should not be trifled with. If the law knows no fixed principles, chaos and confusion will certainly follow. Despite this, we agree that the law should never be stunted in its growth. Precedent may not be sufficient reason, in itself, to sustain. If some principle is based upon an erroneous premise long since dissipated by accurate, dependable knowledge, no one may justifiably or reasonably argue that the law should not be brought up with the times. If it is clear that the reason for a law no longer exists and modern circumstances and justice require a change, and no vested rights will be violated, a change should be made. But, we are not convinced that this situation presents so definite a picture. Furthermore, a rule so long adhered to should not now be rejected except for solid, cogent and convincing reasons. Certainly, its extensive acceptance and survival for more than a century is an index of its soundness as a practical and efficient, fair and wise instrument to determine the important issue involved.\nAdmittedly, criticism is lodged loud and long against the unsoundness of the so-called \u201cright and wrong\u201d test, but by the same token, the other suggested tests are not free from strong-pointed persistent attack and have engendered apparently, even among the psychiatric critics of the rule, justifiable doubts and widespread differences of opinion: Symposium on Psychiatry and The Law, 22 U. Chi. L. Rev. 317-404; Cavanagh, A Psychiatrist Looks at the Durham Decision, 5 Catholic U. L. Rev. 25 et seq.; Moreland, Mental Responsibility and the Criminal Law \u2014 A Defense, 45 Ky. L. J. 215 et seq.; Modlin, The Position of the Psychiatrist in the Administration of the Criminal Law, 4 Kan. L. J. 350 et seq.; Hall, Psychiatry and Criminal Responsibility, 65 Yale L. J. 761. Many psychiatrists, who are very harsh critics of \u201cM\u2019Naghten,\u201d attack each other\u2019s theories even more vehemently.\nThe Durham Rule has been consistently rejected in most state jurisdictions since it ivas first adopted in the state of New Hampshire in 1869: People v. Hubert, 119 Cal. 216, 51 P. 329 (1897); State v. Craig, 52 Wash. 66, 100 P. 167 (1909); Eckert v. State, 114 Wis. 160, 89 N.W. 826 (1902); State v. Lucas, 30 N. J. 37, 152 A. 2d 50 (1959) ; People v. Carpenter, 11 Ill. 2d 60, 142 N.E. 2d 11 (1957) ; Flowers v. State, 236 Ind. 151, 139 N.E. 2d 185 (1956) ; Commonwealth v. Chester, 150 N.E. 2d 914, Mass. Sup. Jud. Ct. (1958) ; Bryant v. State, 207 Md. 565, 115 A. 2d 502 (1955).\nThis rule, simply stated, says that an accused is not responsible if his unlawful act is the product of mental disease or mental defect. Many ask, what do the words \u201cproduct\u201d and \u201cmental defect\u201d mean? \u201cMental defect\u201d is so broad, indefinite and nebulous as to be almost indefinable. The term \u201cproduct\u201d obviously connotes some type of causation. One noted psychiatrist suggests a close affinity between mental illness and criminal behavior. Says he: \u201cMental illness does not cause one to commit a crime nor does mental illness produce a crime. Behavior and mental illness are inseparable \u2014 one and the same thing\u201d: Roche, Criminality and Mental Illness \u2014 Two Faces of the Same Coin, 22 U. Chi. L. Rev. 320 (1955). If this theory were adopted and followed to a logical conclusion, would it not lead to a wholesale safe delivery of criminal offenders through the guise of pleading mental irresponsibility? Another noted author seems to think so: . . Moreover, the average psychiatrist\u2019s attitude toward criminal behavior seems to embody, as basic assumption, that such behavior is prima facie evidence of mental disease. It can, therefore, be expected that few psychiatrists will hesitate to find the necessary causal connection between the crime and the disease, once they have determined the disease to exist, knowing a crime has been committed\u201d: De Grazia, The Distinction of Being Mad, 22 U. Chi. L. Rev. 339-343 (1955). As one court concluded: \u201cIf it is true that, from a psychiatric viewpoint, anti-social behavior either evidences or equals mental disease or defect, then the Durham test comes perilously close to suggesting that proof of the commission of a crime is also prima facie evidence of the legal irresponsibility of the accused\u201d : State v. Lucas, supra.\n\u201cWhat of 'mental disease\u2019 or 'defect\u2019 as employed in the Durham test? Is, for instance, the diagnostic label 'psychopathy\u2019 a mental disease or defect? See Note, 10 Rutgers L. Rev. 425 (1955). If the question of ivhat is a mental disease or defect is a psychiatric one, then the law has abdicated'\u25a0 its function of determining criminal responsibility to the psychiatrist and the jury will have to accept the unopposed psychiatric view of mental disease or defect. The test toill differ with the prevailing psychiatric toinds of the moment State v. Lucas, supra, at 68 (152 A. 2d).\nAnother author and recognized authority says that the Durham test opens the door wide to any psychiatric theory; that it offers nothing specific for the jury to consider and replaces a device used successfully for years in favor of a poorly worded and vague concept: Cavanagh, A Psychiatrist Looks at the Durham. Rule, 5 Catholic U. L. Rev. 25 et seq.\nAnother noted authority says the Durham Rule is not an improvement over the now existing rule. He says, in effect, that it is at best nebulous, leaving the jury to grope about for the relevant facts upon which to base an intelligent decision. See Hall, supra, 65 Yale L. J. 770, 771.\nAnother points to the fact that the Durham Rule emphasizes the question of causation and here the jury can do nothing more than speculate: Wechsler, The Criteria of Criminal Responsibility, 22 U. Chi. L. Rev. 367 (1955).\nThe \u201cIrresistible Impulse\u201d test also has its decriers: See Davidson, Irresistible Impulse and Criminal Responsibility, 1 J. For. Sci. No. 1 Apr. 1956; Hall and Menninger, \u201cPsychiatry and the Law\u201d \u2014 A Dual Review, 38 Iowa L. Rev. 687; Hall, Responsibility and Law, Defense of the H\u2019Naghten Rules, 42 A. B. A. J. 917; and, Waedler, Psychiatry and the Problem of Criminal Responsibility, 101 U. of Pa. L. Rev. 378 et seq. They ask, for instance, supposing the power to resist is only impaired, would this prove irresponsibility? All men are subject to strong urges of various descriptions. Would this reduce \u201cIrresistible Impulse\u201d to something that is not psychopathic at all? Others suggest that it is impossible, in any particular case, to say that an impulse was irresistible; all that can be said is that the impulse did not appear to have been successfully resisted. \u201cThe difficulty of distinguishing between uncontrolled impulse and the impulse that is not controlled would take too fertile a dialectorial field\u201d: Henderson, Psychiatry and The Criminal Law, 4 Psychiatric q. 103; Hamblen Smith, Psychology and The Criminal, 179.\n\u201cWhatever advantages this suggestion (supplementing the right and wrong test by a question as to the individual\u2019s ability to act upon his insight) may hold from the point of view of our sense of justice, it is unlikely to improve the position of the psychiatrist. The concept of irresistible impulse is well defined only in a central area where certain impulses are irresistible to all people. . . . But when we enter the territory of impulses that are resisted by some and not by others, and we should decide whether an urge that Tom could safely check was unconquerable for Dick, we are on shaky ground. There is no criteria for this decision\u201d: Waedler, supra, p. 383. Other psychiatrists say this test is not adequate. They say that there is no clear-cut agreement as to its exact meaning: Spirer, The Psychology of Irresistible Impulse, 33 J. Crim. L., C. & P. S. 457. Many disagree with the appellation \u201cIrresistible Impulse\u201d and now prefer to speak in terms of being \u201cincapable of preventing himself from committing the act.\u201d Others point out that it fails to provide an adequate basis for judging severe psycho-neurotics and others whose criminal acts seem to stem from unconscious motivation. They argue that it absolutely conflicts Avith a theory that all psychiatrists accept, namely, the integration of the functions. They ask, since a normal personality operates as a unit, Iioav is it possible that an essential phase of it, i.e., volition, can be seriously diseased while, at the same time, intelligence remains normal, as the exponents of the \u201cIrresistible Impulse\u201d rule in most part believe. Professor Hall in Psychiatry and Criminal Responsibility says in 65 Yale L. J. at 761, 762 (1956), \u201cThe lawyer pondering the attacks of the psychiatrist critics might also consider the meaningful case of \u2018Irresistible Impulse.\u2019 He would discover that only a short time ago that concept was emphatically presented as an example of the \u2018uniform\u2019 opinion of \u25a0 psychiatrists on criminal responsibility; and yet today \u2018Irresistible Impulse\u2019 is rejected by most psychiatrists as unsound! At this point, the inquiring lawyer might well conclude that psychiatric knowledge is far from being indisputable, and that to reach a sound conclusion of his own he must do something more than choose among the experts.\u201d\nHall sums it up in this manner: \u201cIf one considers the meaning of the legal tests of rationality in relation to criminal responsibility it becomes clear that the assault on the M\u2019Naghten rules implies much more than the presumption that lawyers are amateurs in the field of human psychology. Ultimately, it is an attack on experience and common sense. It assumes that even the most thoughtful layman\u2019s experience with his fellow men and his sensitive insight into the functioning of his own personality in elementary acts for which persons are held responsible are wholly fallacious\u201d: Hall, 42 A. B. A. J., 917, 919.\nThe protection of society is our paramount concern. The science of psychology and its facets are concerned primarily with diagnosis and therapeutics, not with moral judgments. Ethics is the basic element in the judgments of the law and should always continue to be. Until some rule, other than \u201cM\u2019Naghten,\u201d based on a firm foundation in scientific fact for effective operation in the protection and security of society, is forthcoming, we shall adhere to it. We shall not blindly follow the opinion of psychiatric and medical experts and substitute for a legal principle which has proven durable and practicable for decades, vague rules that provide no positive standards.\nDefendant\u2019s counsel contends that the court erred in refusing his fourteenth point for charge. Sufficient is it to say that, assuming for the sake of argument that defense counsel\u2019s assumptions of the law are correct (despite Commonwealth v. Schroeder, 302 Pa. 1, 152 Atl. 835 (1930); Commonwealth v. Daverse, 364 Pa. 623, 73 A. 2d 405 (1950)), there is not a scintilla of evidence of the contemporaneous existence of homicidial insanity or of an habitual tendency which evidenced itself at any other time previous to the killing. The defendant, therefore, did not meet the burden of proof required to come within the test of Commonwealth v. Hosler, supra, and Coyle v. Commonwealth, 100 Pa. 573.\nThe rejection of this requested point for charge, therefore, was absolutely correct and proper.\nLastly, complaint is made of the court\u2019s instructions as to the weight to be given expert medical opinion. The language was as follows: \u201cThe determination of whether the defendant was legally insane on August 6, 1953, depends to a great extent upon the defendant\u2019s statements and the observations of his actions immediately before and after the alleged shooting. Therefore, it is important to consider the opportunity each witness had to observe defendant\u2019s actions and what interest, if any, the witness may have in the outcome of the case. In addition thereto, you will consider the opinions of the psychiatrists. You must consider their training, qualifications and experience, and the date or dates when they examined the defendant. It must be kept in mind that an opinion is only an opinion. It creates no fact. Because of this, opinion evidence is considered of a low grade and not entitled to much weight against positive testimony of actual facts such as statements by the defendant and observations of his actions.\u201d This was an accurate statement of the law. The lay witnesses called by the Commonwealth in rebuttal testified to actual facts. The executive officer of the Boy Scouts and the young lady patient, who saw the defendant on the same morning, right after the murder, had the unusual opportunity of seeing and observing him at a most important hour. Even witnesses called by the defense testified as to the normal conduct of the defendant on the day of the killing. They testified as to what they saw. The conclusions to be drawn therefrom were completely within the province of the jury. The state policemen, to whom the defendant gave a very lengthy statement six or seven days later, after his release from the hospital, testified to what they saw and observed. An analysis of the statement itself, which is undenied, manifests a splendid recollection of the incidents of the killing and the reasons therefor. It demonstrates quite vividly a mind fully conscious of the nature and consequences of his act and the knowledge that it was wrong. All this was positive proof of actual facts. Actual facts, proven by positive evidence, are under the law of Pennsylvania entitled to far more weight than opinion evidence, even that of experts: Commonwealth v. Lance, supra; Commonwealth v. Patskin, supra; Commonwealth v. Heller, supra. Where the logical conclusions to be drawn from the proof of actual facts is at variance with opinion evidence, then the ultimate truth is for the jury.\nConcluding, if the jury believed in the correctness of the opinions voiced by the psychiatrists, the defendant would have been acquitted. Their testimony was substantially adequate to excuse the defendant under the rule stated in M\u2019Naghten\u2019s case. The jury refused credence to these opinions. This was its prerogative. Strong reliance must be placed on the common sense and the feeling for substantial justice possessed and applied by the average jury. The appellate court is not the finder of the truth, nor is it within our province to assess the credibility of the testimony: Commonwealth v. Logan, 361 Pa. 186, 191, 63 A. 2d 28 (1919).\nJudgment and sentence affirmed.\n\u25a0Mr. Justice Cohen dissents.\nEmphasis supplied throughout.\nIt is to be noted that in the present case, the trial judge went even further than this rule of law necessitated, when he added, \u201c. . . and had mental power sufficient to apply that knowledge to his oion case. . . .\u201d (Emphasis ours).\nIn these jurisdictions, a person is excused from guilt for the commission of crime, if he is incapable of knowing the wrongfulness of the act, or even though he does know that it is wrong, if he is incapable of controlling the impulse to commit it.\nAn accused is not criminally responsible if his unlawful act was the product of mental disease or mental defect.\nThis is supported by Dr. Sidney Bolter, a Michigan psychiatrist, who, at the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s one hundred and sixteenth annual meeting, was quoted as saying that the Durham Rule \u201copens the door to the introduction of all kinds of unproven, unwarranted, theoretical assumptions about human behavior\u201d: Phila. Evening Bulletin, May 10, 1960, p. 16, col. 1.\n\u201cIf tlie mind of the defendant was so affected by disease at the time of the act in question that he could not control his actions, he was not responsible and your verdict must be not guilty.\u201d"}
