{"id": "937819", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThese two cases grew out of the same accident and raise the same question.\nThe plaintiff was entitled to go to the jury on the presumption that the deceased did his duty to \u201c stop, look and listen \u201d before driving on the tracks. Whether that presumption was rebutted was for the jury unless the evidence to the contrary was clear, positive, credible, and either uncontradicted or so.indisputable in weight and amount as to justify the court in holding that a verdict against it* must be set aside as a matter of law. The testimony in this c\u00e1se falls short of that standard; Three witnesses testified to having seen the deceased as he approached the crossing, and that they did not see him stop, but none of them covered the entire approach. Even Wise, the most important witness of all, testified there was a \u201c bump \u201d (a dip) in the road where he lost sight of the deceased, and in answer to the question \u201c before they (the deceased) went on the track that day did they stop or did they not?\u201d answered \u201c they was back there long enough to stop behind that bump \u201d and being asked to give his best judgment, said \u201c I would say they must have stopped for they was back there long enough to stop.\u201d While there was testimony persuasive that they did not stop, it was not so positive or so complete as to justify the judge in saying as a matter of law that the presumption had been rebutted.\nJudgment affirmed."}
