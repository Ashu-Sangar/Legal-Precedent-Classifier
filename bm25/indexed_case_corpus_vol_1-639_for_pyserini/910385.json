{"id": "910385", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe find no error in this record that requires either reversal or modification of the decree from which this appeal was taken. The findings of fact were fully warranted by the pleadings and evidence, and the conclusions drawn therefrom are substantially correct. All that need be said in support of the decree will be found in the clear and satisfactory opinion of the learned trial judge, and on it the decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
