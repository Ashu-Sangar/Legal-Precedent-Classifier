{"id": "1100733", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 30th day of November 2004, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED, limited to the following questions of law:\n1. Whether, as a preliminary matter, petitioner was required, under Article VIII, Section 2(a)(v) of the Pennsylvania Constitution, to demonstrate that the parcel in question independently served, in and of itself, a charitable purpose in order for petitioner to be considered for real estate tax exemption?\n2. If the answer to question 1 is \u201cno,\u201d whether the Commonwealth Court erred in holding that the statutory presumption of real estate tax exemption, which arises in favor of a qualifying entity under 10 P.S. \u00a7 376, was irrelevant in this case, and hence not applicable to petitioner, as a whole, because the parcel in question was clearly not charitable based on the undisputed facts?"}
