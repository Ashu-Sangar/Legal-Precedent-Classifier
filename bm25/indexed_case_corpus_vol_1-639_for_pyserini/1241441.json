{"id": "1241441", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nIn this will construction we are required to determine whether a gift in remainder is vested or contingent. The court below, one judge dissenting, held that the remainder was contingent.\nTestator\u2019s residuary estate was placed in trust to pay the net income to three named children for life and upon the death of each named child: \u201cto convey, transfer, assign and pay over the principal of one-third of my residuary estate to my right heirs at law under the terms of the intestate law of Pennsylvania, absolutely, clear of trusts.\u201d\nThe share in litigation is that of testator\u2019s daughter, Adeline E. Proriep, who died August 4, 1950, a widow, and without issue. She married Charles Neeld subsequent to testator\u2019s death, and such husband predeceased her.\nIt is to be initially noted that the gift in remainder is necessarily implied solely because of the testamentary direction \u201cto convey, transfer, assign and pay over.\u201d These words constitute what is known as a \u201cpay and divide\u201d case. The rule has been repeatedly quoted, and is what was accurately stated by Chief Justice Gibson in Moore v. Smith, 9 Watts 403, 407: \u201c. . . where there is no separate and antecedent gift which is independent of the direction and time for payment, the legacy is contingent; and it seems to be as well founded in reason, as rules of interpretation usually are. Where a gift is only implied from a direction to pay, it is necessarily inseparable from the direction, and must partake of its quality; insomuch that if the one is future and contingent, so must the other be.\u201d\nThis rule is also stated by Josiah W. Smith, an English barrister, in his scholarly book \u201cExecutory Interests\u201d (1845), sec. 314, p. 150: \u201c(1) It must be carefully noticed, that where there is no gift but in a direction to pay or transfer or divide among several persons, at a future period; though the future period is annexed to the payment, possession, or enjoyment, yet it is also annexed to the devise or-bequest itself. For, in this case, the direction to pay or transfer or divide, constitutes the devise or bequest itself; and, therefore, the vesting in interest is postponed, and not merely the vesting in possession or enjoyment.\u201d\nThe antecedent gifts of income were not in any sense gifts of principal and consequently did not constitute an \u201cantecedent gift which is independent of the direction and time for payment\u201d within the meaning of the rule: Moore v. Smith, supra; Rickenbach Estate, 348 Pa. 121, 34 A. 2d 527; Wilson Estate, 369 Pa. 583, 87 A. 2d 648.\nAs the testamentary provisions concerning the disposition of the remainder clearly constitute a contingent gift, there is no necessity to consider whether, following a life estate, a gift to heirs or next of kin relates to those ascertained as of testator\u2019s or the life tenant\u2019s decease, and the application of the Act of June 29, 1923 P. L. 914, 21 PS 11.\nThis case is closely analogous to Wilson Estate, supra. The learned opinion of Judge Hunter for the court below so comprehensively and accurately states the law and its application to the present case that it is unnecessary for us to amplify his opinion.\nDecree affirmed at cost of appellants."}
