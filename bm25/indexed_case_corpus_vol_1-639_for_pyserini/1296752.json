{"id": "1296752", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Chief Justice Jones,\nThe appellant filed a petition in the court below, under the provisions of Section 1 of the Act of March 14, 1876, P. L. 7, 12 PS \u00a7978, to have a judgment against her marked satisfied of record. The judgment had been entered by confession upon warrant of attorney contained in a note signed by the appellant. Pursuing the procedure prescribed by the Act, the court entered a rule on the respondent to show cause why the relief prayed for should not be granted. After depositions had been taken, filed, and considered, the court discharged the rule and, from that order, the petitioner has appealed.\nThe appeal must be dismissed since no appellate review lies where a rule, issued on a petition under the Act of 1876, supra, and calling upon the respondent to show cause why a judgment should not be satisfied of record, is discharged.
