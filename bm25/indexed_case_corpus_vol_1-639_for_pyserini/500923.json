II., c. 9, and 8 and 9 William III., c. 11, are in force in this state. The report of the judges, frequent recognition in the opinions of this court, if not direct decisions and uniform practice have settled it. The refusal of the certificate is not the subject of review in this court. We affirm this judgment upon the opinion of the learned judge in the court below.\nJudgment affirmed."}
