{"id": "462790", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the judgment of the court below deciding against the plaintiff the questions of law raised by the affidavit of defense. The plaintiff, who is the widow of John Hirko, sued the Coroner of Luzerne County in an action of trespass to recover damages upon the allegation that the Coroner,improperly authorized and directed an autopsy to be performed upon- the body of her husband.\nAt about 6:25 P.M. on August 23,1943, while plaintiff\u2019s husband was working in a mine, he collapsed and immediately thereafter died. His body Was taken to the Hazleton State Hospital and there the defendant caused an autopsy to be performed on it to determine the cause of death. The plaintiff averred that the autopsy was performed without her knowledge or consent and against her wishes; that the Inspector of Mines was not present at the autopsy and did not authorize it; that the defendant in causing the autopsy to be performed acted arbitrarily and negligently, and that there were no circumstances attending the death of her husband that justified the autopsy. Plaintiff also averred that the defendant\u2019s deputy, John J. Salvator, who was representing the defendant, refused to surrender the body of plaintiff\u2019s husband to plaintiff\u2019s agent, one John J. Burcin, an undertaker, who was delegated by the plaintiff to take charge and custody of same and who requested the body from defendant\u2019s deputy on plaintiff\u2019s behalf.\nThe Act of July 12, 1935, P. L. 710, Sec. 2; 16 P.S. Sec. 3161, provides as follows:\n\u201cIt shall be the duty of the coroner or the deputy coroner of any county in this Commonwealth, in all cases where death is sudden or violent or is of a suspicious nature and character to cause a careful investigation of the facts concerning said death to be made, to ascertain whether the death was due to other than natural causes, and to make or cause to be made such an autopsy as the facts of the case may demand.\u201d . .\nThe court below held that the authority of a Coroner to cause an autopsy to be made in all cases where death is sudden or violent does not depend on the consent of the next of kin of the deceased, but that it- is an official right. The court also held that this right was not limited, at least under the facts of this case, by the provisions of Sec. 3 of Article XIII of the Anthracite Mine Law, Act of June 2,1891, P.L. 176, 52 P.S. 541. The article of the Mine Law just cited relates to inquests and not to autopsies, and it provides in Section 3 that the inquest which \u201cshall be adjourned by the Coroner if the Inspector of Mines be not present to watch the proceedings\u201d is \u201can inquest held by the Coroner upon the body of a person killed by explosion or other accident.\u201d Section 5 likewise refers to \u201cany inquest held over the body or bodies of persons whose death was caused by an accident in or about a mine or colliery.\u201d The plaintiff does not aver that the death of her husband was thus caused; therefore, the Coroner\u2019s right to hold this inquest under the authority of the Act of 1935 was not dependent upon the presence of the Mine Inspector. The provision requiring the presence of the Mine Inspector at the inquest described in Sections 3 and 5 of Article XIII is obviously not for the purpose of enabling the Coroner to secure the Inspector\u2019s professional advice as to whether or not an autopsy is necessary or desirable, but it is for the purpose of enabling the Inspector to hear all the testimony as to the cause of the \u201cexplosion or other accident\u201d to the end that he may take steps to prevent similar accidents in the future and so that if \u201cthe evidence given at the inquest\u201d shows that \u201cthe accident was caused by neglect or by any defect in or about the mine or colliery\u201d (quoting from Section 5) the Inspector may institute appropriate criminal proceedings. The inquest provided for in Article XIII is for the purpose of determining the cause of the accident and not for the purpose of determining the physical cause of the death of the accident\u2019s victims.\nThe plaintiff is predicating her claim not upon an inquest but upon an autopsy. A Coroner\u2019s inquest to determine the cause of a fatal accident does not necessarily involve the performance of an autopsy upon the bodies of the victims of that accident. Whether or not an autopsy shall be performed upon the body of a person whose death \u201cis sudden or violent or is of a suspicious nature and character\u201d is left by the Act of 1935, supra, for the Coroner to determine \u201cas the facts of the case may demand.\u201d It is not alleged that the Coroner acted in bad faith in this matter. The presumption is that he, as a public official, acted in good faith. This court said in County of Lancaster v. Mishler, 100 Pa. 624: \u201cWhenever he [the Coroner] holds one [an inquest] the presumption is that he acted in good faith and on sufficient cause.\u201d\nAs to the alleged refusal of the Coroner\u2019s deputy \u201cto surrender the body of plaintiff\u2019s husband\u201d to the undertaker delegated by the plaintiff to receive it, this statement does not set forth how long this refusal was persisted in, that is, whether the body was held only temporarily or otherwise, and plaintiff does not claim any damages by reason of that alleged refusal to surrender the body. The damages claimed are all predicated upon the autopsy.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
