{"id": "1722167", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nThis appeal arises from the dismissal, without a hearing, of the Post Conviction Hearing Act Petition of appellant, Dallas Robert Scott.\nThe facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. On February 18, 1970, appellant was convicted of murder in the second degree. Post-trial motions were filed, but subsequently withdrawn. Appellant was sentenced to a term of ten to twenty years in a state correctional institution. A direct appeal was taken to this court, which affirmed the judgment of sentence. Commonwealth v. Scott, 445 Pa. 618, 284 A.2d 311 (1971).\nIn 1973, appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Following an evidentiary hearing, the petition was denied on September 24, 1974.\nOn November 13, 1974, appellant filed a pro se petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act. Counsel was appointed, but no amended petition was filed. On December 5, 1974, appellant\u2019s petition was dismissed without a hearing.\nAppellant\u2019s pro se petition was inarticulately drawn and, in the opinion of the court below, failed to allege \u201cfacts that if proven would entitle petitioner to relief. ..\u201d 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-9. This appeal followed.\nWe do not reach the merits of appellant\u2019s claim because of the procedural posture of this case. In the instant case, pursuant to the mandate of Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 427 Pa. 395, 397, 235 A.2d 148 (1967), the public defender\u2019s office was appointed to aid the appellant in his post-conviction proceeding. In Mitchell, this court, in requiring appointment of counsel, stated:\n\u201cWe pause to note that the mandatory appointment requirement is a salutary one and best comports with efficient judicial administration and serious consideration of a prisoner\u2019s claims. Counsel\u2019s ability to frame the issues in a legally meaningful fashion inures the trial court that all relevant considerations will be brought to its attention. As recognized by the American Bar Association Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Post-Conviction Remedies \u00a7 4.4, at 66 (1967): \u2018It is a waste of valuable judicial manpower and an inefficient method of seriously treating the substantive merits of applications for post-conviction relief to proceed without counsel for the applicants who have filed pro se. . Exploration of the legal grounds for complaint, investigation of the underlying facts, and more articulate statements of claims are functions of an advocate that are inappropriate for a judge, or his staff.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nIn Commonwealth v. Fiero, 462 Pa. 409, 341 A.2d 448, 450 (1975), this court reaffirmed Mitchell, and further defined counsel\u2019s role by stating:\n\u201cClearly this rule is not limited to the mere naming of an attorney to represent an accused, but also envisions that counsel so appointed shall have the opportunity and in fact discharge the responsibilities required by his representation.\u201d\nUnder the circumstances of this case, appellant\u2019s appointed counsel failed to perform his duties and responsibilities of adequate representation. Therefore, the post-conviction proceedings were uncounselled and violative of Mitchell and \u00a7 12 of the Post Conviction Hearing Act.\nOrder of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County is vacated and the matter is remanded to that court with instructions to appoint counsel to represent appellant in the filing of an amended post-conviction petition and any further proceedings thereon.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a concurring opinion.\n. Act of January 25, 1966, P.L. 1580 \u00a7 1, et seq., 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-1, et seq. (Supp.1975-76).\n. Such amendments should of course be filed, when necessary for adequate representation."}
