{"id": "574191", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nAppellant, Curtis Davis, was arrested in December of 1968 and charged with murder, voluntary manslaughter, involuntary manslaughter and robbery. A timely filed pre-trial motion to suppress evidence was denied. Thereafter, on September 25, 1969, appellant was adjudged guilty, by a jury, of murder, voluntary manslaughter and two counts of robbery. Appellant was sentenced, by the jury, to death on the murder conviction, and from ten to twenty years imprisonment, by the court, on the robbery convictions. Post-trial motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial were denied. This direct appeal followed. We now reverse and remand for a new trial.\nAppellant contends that the assistant district attorney committed reversible error by attempting to create an impermissible adverse inference in the minds of the jurors regarding appellant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights at trial. Appellant alleges that this was accomplished by the prosecutor\u2019s persistent references in his closing argument, over objection, to the evidence against the defendant being \u201cuncontroverted.\u201d Review of the record supports appellant\u2019s contention that the prosecution\u2019s repeated use of the words \u201cuncontroverted\u201d and \u201cuncontroverted fact\u201d created an adverse inference prohibited by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Article 1, \u00a79 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and the Act of May 23, 1887.\nIt is well settled that the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S. Ct. 1489 (1964), forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence at trial or instructions by the court that such is evidence of guilt. Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S. Ct. 1229 (1965). \u201cUpon the present record, [we] believe that the prosecutorial comment about the \u2018uncontradicted\u2019 [or \u2018uncontroverted\u2019] nature of the Commonwealth\u2019s case runs directly afoul of the Griffin prohibition.\u201d Commonwealth v. Allen, 445 Pa. 156, 159, 281 A. 2d 634, 635 (1971) (Roberts, J., dissenting from an opinionless per curiam affirmance, joined by Eag-en, J., and O\u2019Brien, J.).\nHere, where appellant neither testified at trial nor offered any other defense, the \u201c. . . prosecutor\u2019s statement [s] implied that the . . . [defendant himself ivas] the only [one] who could and should have denied the charges against [him]. The jury might reasonably have inferred from [these] statement [s] that [his] failure to do so was evidence of [his] guilt.\u201d Commonwealth v. Reichard, 211 Pa. Superior Ct. 55, 60, 233 A. 2d 603, 606 (1967). Such an inference is patently contrary to the mandate of Griffin, supra.\nAs th.e First Circuit recently stated in United States v. Flannery, 451 F. 2d 880, 881-82 (1971) : \u201c. . . [W]e [have] held that for the government to say, in summation to the jury, that certain of its evidence was \u2018uncontradicted,\u2019 when contradiction would have required the defendant to take the stand, drew attention to his failure to do so, and hence was unconstitutional comment. Desmond v. United States, 1 Cir., 1965, 345 F. 2d 225. We do not adopt the reasoning of those courts which state, as it seems to us, ingenuously, that to say that the government\u2019s witnesses\u2019 testimony was uncontradicted is simply a statement of historical fact. There are many \u2018facts\u2019 which are benign in themselves. The difficulty is that such reference, when only the defendant could have contradicted, clearly calls to the jury\u2019s mind the fact that he failed to testify.\u201d (Emphasis added) (Footnotes omitted). Accord, United States v. Handman, 447 F. 2d 853 (7th Cir. 1971); United States ex rel. Leak v. Follette, 418 F. 2d 1266 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1050, 90 S. Ct. 1388; Rodriguez-Sandoval v. United States, 409 F. 2d 529 (1st Cir. 1969); Doty v. United States, 416 F. 2d 887 (10th Cir. 1968), vacated sub. nom., Epps v. United States, 401 U.S. 1006, 91 S.

United States, 341 F. 2d 60, 64-65 (5th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 988, 85 S. Ct. 1362.\nOn this record, where appellant did not testify and offered no other witnesses or evidence at trial, it would be an act of sophistry to conclude that the remarks of the assistant district attorney could have been taken as anything other than a reference to the fact that appellant, and appellant alone, failed to rebut the evidence against him. The prosecutor\u2019s attempt to have the jury equate appellant\u2019s guilt with his silence at trial was improper. Such comments, even by implication, are violative of Griffin, supra. See also Hand-man, supra.\nNot only were appellant\u2019s rights under the United States Constitution violated, but also his rights under Article 1, \u00a79 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and the Act of May 23, 1887 which implements it. It is well settled that any comment by the prosecution or the court violates the Act of 1887 if it \u201c. . . draws attention to or focuses on the fact that no one except the defendant can rebut the Commonwealth\u2019s case. . . .\u201d Reichard, supra at 58, 233 A. 2d at 604. It is obvious, on this record, that the prosecutor\u2019s comments clearly did that which is prohibited by the Act. \u201cWe think the assistant district attorney went too far, both under the Act of 1887 and under the Fifth Amendment proscription as enunciated in Griffin.\u201d Commonwealth v. Camm, 443 Pa. 253, 268, 277 A. 2d 325, 333 (1971).\nWe hold that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were error, and also that they were harmful error, necessitating the grant of a new trial. On this record, the prosecution\u2019s comments cannot be held to be \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\nOur analysis of the gravity and impact of the error is guided by two general precepts. First, \u201c. . . before a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 828 (1967). See Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 251, 89 S. Ct. 1726, 1727 (1969); Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.S. 427, 92 S. Ct. 1056 (1972). This reasonable doubt standard reflects a fundamental belief that once constitutional error has been established, it is far worse to conclude incorrectly that the error was harmless than it is to conclude incorrectly that the error was reversible. Cf. In Re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S. Ct. 1068 (1970).\nThe second general precept with which we approach the determination of whether a particular constitutional error was harmless is that the burden is on the Commonwealth to establish that the error was harmless. Chapman v. California, supra at 24, 26, 87 S. Ct. at 828, 829; Fontaine v. California, 390 U.S. 593, 596, 88 S. Ct. 1229, 1231 (1968). It should be noted that placing the burden on the Commonwealth is in accordance with \u201cthe original common-law harmless-error rule [that] put the burden on the beneficiary of the error either to prove that there ivas no injury or to suffer a reversal of his erroneously obtained judgment.\u201d Chapman v. California, supra, 386 U.S. at 18,20-23, 87 S. Ct. at 828 (citing 1 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a721 (3d ed. 1940).\nKeeping these precepts in mind, we must determine whether \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility\u201d that the constitutional error \u201cmight have contributed to the conviction.\u201d Chapman v. California, supra, 386 U.S. at 24, 87 S. Ct. at 828. If there is such a possibility, the constitutional error is reversible. But if there is no reasonable possibility that the constitutional error might have moved \u201cthe minds of an average jury\u201d toward conviction, then it can be said that the error was harmless.\nCases subsequent to Chapman have established one exception to the general proposition that if there is a reasonable possibility that the constitutional error might have contributed to the conviction, the error cannot be harmless. That exception is presented by those cases where the \u201cproperly admitted evidence of guilt is so overwhelming, and the prejudicial effect of the . . . [constitutional error] is so insignificant by comparison, that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the . . . [constitutional error] was harmless error.\u201d Schneble v. Florida, supra at 430, 92 S. Ct. at 1059; see Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S. Ct. 1726 (1969).\nIt should be emphasized that a conclusion that the properly admitted evidence is \u201cso overwhelming,\u201d and the prejudicial effect of the constitutional error is \u201cso insignificant\u201d by comparison, that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error is harmless, is not to be arrived at lightly. For the effect of such a conclusion is to affirm a conviction where it is conceded that an error of constitutional proportions contributed in some degree to the conviction. In addition, such a conclusion operates to undermine \u201cthe deterrent effect of such cases as Mapp v. Ohio; Griffin v. California; Miranda v. Arizona; United States v. Wade; and Bruton v. United States, on the actions of both police and prosecutors, not to speak of trial courts. . . .\u201d Harrington v. California, supra, 395 U.S. at 255, 89 S. Ct. at 1729 (Brennan, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).\nApplying these standards to the present case, we do not believe that the Commonwealth has established beyond a reasonable doubt that the constitutional error present in this case was harmless. The Commonwealth, during its closing address to the jury, thoroughly exploited appellant\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right not to take the witness stand. The prosecutor argued that \u201c'under the uncontroverted facts the Commonwealth has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant is guilty of murder in the first degree and robbery.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The prosecutor also repeatedly used the term \u201cuncontroverted\u201d or \u201cuncontroverted facts\u201d at least three other times in referring to portions of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. This argument was obviously calculated to move the jury toward conviction: \u201cIndeed, the very persistence of the government in making these remarks is proof that it attached much importance to them.\u201d Rodriguez-Bandoval, supra at 581. We must conclude that there is a reasonable possibility that the prosecutor\u2019s unconstitutional argument \u201cmight have contributed to the conviction.\u201d\nWe also do not believe that the evidence against appellant in this case can be characterized as \u201coverwhelming.\u201d The only witness who could definitely identify appellant at the trial had been unable to identify appellant at a pre-trial lineup. One other witness was unable to identify appellant at all. The murder weapon was linked to appellant only by showing that it was found at an apartment belonging to a woman described by one witness as appellant\u2019s girl friend, an apartment to which appellant had a key and near which appellant\u2019s car was observed some two and one-half hours after the shooting. Ownership of the weapon was never proved by the Commonwealth. The only other evidence against appellant was a tan hood and a dark jacket, found at the same apartment, which were by no means unique but which were similar to the hood and jacket which two eyewitnesses described the perpetrator as wearing. Although the case against appellant was reasonably strong, it nevertheless is certainly a case in which \u201chonest, fair-minded jurors might very well have brought in not guilty verdicts.\u201d Chapman v. California, supra, 386 U.S. at 26, 87 S. Ct. at 829.\nThe judgment of sentence is reversed and a new trial granted.\nMr. Justice Eagsn concurs in the result.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones dissents.\nAppellant also contends that additional errors were committed by the trial court and that certain evidence, allegedly illegally seized, should have been suppressed. Appellant also challenges the legality of his arrest However, in view of our disposition, we need not decide these issues.\n\u201cNo person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\" U. S. Const Amend. V.\n\u201c[The accused] cannot be compelled to give evidence against himself . . . .\u201d Pa. Const. Art. I, \u00a79.\n\u201cExcept defendants actually upon trial in a criminal court, any competent witness may be compelled to testify in any proceeding, civil or criminal; but he may not be compelled to answer any question which, in the opinion of the trial judge, would tend to criminate him; nor may the negleet or refusal of any defendant, actually upon trial in a criminal court, to offer himself as a witness be treated as creating any presumption against him, or be adversely referred to by court or counsel during the trial.\u201d P. L. 158, \u00a710, 19 P.S. \u00a7631.\n\u201cAs the Supreme Court stated in Griffin, the presumption of innocence in favor of a defendant in a criminal case is seriously jeopardized by any comment concerning his silence. Realistically, the defendant\u2019s words and actions will be viewed with a critical eye if he chooses to testify. \u2018It is not everyone who can safely venture on the witness stand though entirely innocent of the charge against him. Excessive timidity, nervousness when facing others, and attempting to explain transactions of a suspicious character, and offenses charged against him, will often confuse and embarrass him to such a degree as to increase rather than remove prejudices against him. It is not everyone, however honest, who would, therefore, willingly be placed on the witness stand.\u2019 Wilson v. United States, 149 U.S. 60 at 66 (1893). A defendant may refuse to testify for reasons wholly unrelated to his innocence or guilt. Consequently, permitting comment upon the defendant\u2019s failure to testify subjects the accused to the hard choice of testifying or running the risk of a jury\u2019s unwarranted inference of guilt from his silence.\u201d Commonwealth v. Reichard, 211 Pa. Superior Ct. 55, 59-60, 233 A. 2d 603, 605 (1967) (footnotes omitted).\nThe use of the word \u201cuncontroverted\u201d in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument was error for another reason, since the defendant at trial need not affirmatively deny any allegation at all. There is always a jury question as to every issue, except those expressly conceded, on which the government has the burden. See, e.g., Minor v. United States, 445 F. 2d 637 (8th Cir. 1971) ; United States v. Alessio, 439 F. 2d 803 (1st Cir. 1971) ; DeCecco v. United States, 338 F. 2d 797 (1st Cir. 1984).\nSee notes 3 and 4, supra.\nIt should also be noted that federal standards govern what constitutional error must be considered prejudicial. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 21, 87 S. Ct. 824, 826-27 (1967).\nHarrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 254, 89 S. Ct. 1726, 1728 (1969).\nAt one point in summation the prosecutor stated: \u201cIt is also uncontroverted that Curtis Davis received a paper bag from Mr. Darlak and said something, I can\u2019t remember the exact word, but it is something like, I am going to give you this, or words to that effect, and then fired two shots in quick succession.\n\u201cYou can find from this series of uncontroverted facts, members of the jury, that Mr. Davis, the defendant here, was in fact robbing Mr. Darlak at the time, . . .\u201d Clearly, these statements could only have been made by the prosecutor in the hope that the jury would infer that appellant, by failing to testify, was admitting his guilt.\n\u201cIn such a case we are unwilling to allow the government to act improperly and then avoid reversal by the unprovable assertion that grievous prejudice probably did not result.\u201d Rodriguez-Sandoval v. United States, 409 F. 2d 529, 531 (1st Cir. 1969)."}
