{"id": "864239", "contents": "Per. Curiam,\nThe act of May 25th, 1874, Purdon, 793, pi. 33, provides that \u201c In all cases in which a writ of error or an appeal from a decree in equity shall delay the proceedings on the judgment of the inferior court, and in the opinion of the Supreme Court the same shall have been sued out merely for delay, damages at the rate of six per cent per annum shall be awarded upon the amount of said judgment or decree by the Supreme Court and an attorney fee of twenty dollars and the cost of printing the paper-book of the defendant in error or appellee, shall be taxed and collected as part of the costs of suit.\u201d\nProceedings on the judgment of the court below were undoubtedly delayed by the defendant\u2019s appeal to this Court; and we are clearly of opinion that said appeal was taken \u201c merely for delay.\u201d No other inference can be fairly drawn from the facts before us. The plaintiff is therefore clearly entitled to the damages etc. specified in the act.\nRule absolute, and damages at the rate of six per centum per annum on the amount of the judgment are hereby awarded in favor of the plaintiff, and against the defendant, together with a docket fee of twenty dollars and costs of printing appellee\u2019s paper-book, if any, to be taxed and collected as part of the costs."}
