Two issues are raised in this appeal: (1) whether there was probable cause for appellant\u2019s arrest and (2) whether the two verdicts are inconsistent. After review of the record and consideration of these issues we find them to be without merit.\nJ\u00fcdgments of sentence affirmed.\nJONES, former C. J., did not participate in the decision of this case."}
