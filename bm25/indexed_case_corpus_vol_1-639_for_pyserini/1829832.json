{"id": "1829832", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPAPADAKOS, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court affirming the order of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Board), dismissing the claim of Appellant, JoAnn Peterson, for worker\u2019s compensation benefits. The Appellant, a licensed practical nurse employed by the Appellee, PRN Nursing Agency (PRN), fractured her left leg and left ankle in an automobile accident on September 19, 1980, while travelling to her assigned workplace.\nFollowing four separate evidentiary hearings, a worker\u2019s compensation referee awarded the Appellant worker\u2019s compensation benefits, as provided in the Pennsylvania Worker\u2019s Compensation Act (Act) 77 P.S. \u00a7 1, et seq., after he concluded that the Appellant was in the course of her duties when the accident occurred. Therefore, as a conclusion of law, he determined that the claimant was entitled to total disability benefits commencing September 19, 1980, and continuing indefinitely into the future.\nThe Appellee appealed to the Board which determined that the Referee\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d were, in actuality, \u201cConclusions of Law\u201d and concluded that the Appellant was not entitled to total disability. It remanded the case for the fact-finding function to be completed.\nTo save time and expense, the parties certified the prior record and exhibits. The referee reviewed the prior record and all additional testimony, including the deposition of Gina M. Blakeley, Appellant\u2019s supervisor and a twenty percent shareholder in PRN. Thereafter, he framed his own findings of fact and conclusions of law which we have summarized below. The Appellee, PRN Nursing Agency, although it is not a health care provider, entered into agreements with various hospitals, nursing homes, and private individuals, for the purpose of supplying registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and nursing assistants, to those parties as their needs arose. At its office in downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Appellee maintained its records, received telephone calls from institutions and individuals requesting its staff, and dispatched its employees to various locations throughout the Allegheny County area. Appellee did not require its employees to report to its office for assignment; instead, Appellee would contact its employees at their homes, one week in advance of the assignment, to inquire as to whether they were interested in accepting a work assignment. When an employee accepted a work assignment, Appellee instructed the employee where to report for work, when to report to work, and to arrive in uniform.\nMoreover, the Appellee did not provide transportation to the work-place, it did not reimburse its employees for their travel expenses, and it did not include time spent commuting to and from an assigned workplace in the computation of an employee\u2019s gross wages. Employees were paid an hourly rate, calculated from the time they signed in at the assigned work-place to the time they signed out of that work-place. Work hours were totaled by the work-place and forwarded to the Appellee, who used those figures to compute an employee\u2019s gross wages. The Appellee paid its employees by check, after it made the necessary deductions.\nThe Appellee contacted the Appellant and asked if she would work a new assignment on September 19, 1980, at Montefiore Hospital \u2014 the 11:00 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. shift \u2014 and she accepted. The Appellee did not instruct the Appellant to make any stops, to deliver any messages, to pick up any materials, or to perform any service on behalf of PRN prior to reporting to work at Montefiore. In fact, Appellant was free to select any route to and from her worksite.\nOn or about September 23, 1980, the Appellant informed the Appellee that she had been involved in an accident, she was injured, and she would be unable to work; however, she failed to advise Appellee that her injuries were related to her employment, or that her injuries were incurred in the course of her employment. As a consequence, the Appellee did not file an Employer\u2019s Report of Injury. Notice, that this was a work related injury, did not come until the Appellant filed her claim petition on October 8, 1982, a date greater than two years following the automobile accident. Based on this evidence, the referee found:\n1) ... [T]he [Appellant] failed to give notice of any work-related injury within 120 days of said injury as required by Section 311 of the Act;\n2) ... [T]he [Appellant] failed to inform her employer of any injury as is required by Section 312 of the Act;\n3) ... [T]he [Appellant] was not acting within the scope of her employment at the time of her injury on September 19, 1980;\n4) The [Appellant] was not in any way acting in the furtherance of her employer\u2019s business at the time of her injury on September 19, 1980; and,\n5) The [Appellant] did not suffer an injury during the course of her employment with the defendant on September 19, 1980, and therefore, is not entitled to compensation benefits.\n(Referee\u2019s decision, January 28, 1986.) The claim was then dismissed. (Id.) Appellant appealed to the Board for review.\nGina Blakeley testified that the Appellant called the Appellee\u2019s offices on Monday September 22, 1980, to inform it that she had been in an auto accident and that the accident occurred while she was en route to Montefiore Hospital. Section 631 states the following in regard to notice:\nUnless an employer shall have knowledge of the occurrence of the injury ... no compensation shall be due until such notice be given, and, unless such notice be given within one hundred and twenty days after the occurrence of the injury, no compensation shall be allowed.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 631. This uncontradicted evidence established the Appellant\u2019s allegation that she gave her employer notice of the accident well within the 120 day period. The Board reversed the referee\u2019s decision, because it found the above testimony to be irreconcilable with the referee\u2019s findings of fact.\nNext, the Board considered' whether, or not, the Appellant was injured within the scope of her employment. The general rule is that an employer is not liable to the employee for compensation for injuries received off the employer\u2019s premise while the employee is travelling to or from work. Eberle v. Union Dental Co., 390 Pa. 112, 134 A.2d 559 (1957); Butrin v. Manion Steel Co., 361 Pa. 166, 63 A.2d 345 (1949); Hohman v. George H. Soffel Co., 354 Pa. 31, 46 A.2d 475 (1946). The question, whether an injury to a worker is sustained in the course of his or her employment, as contemplated by the Act, is one of law. Hohman, supra.\nWhile acknowledging the general rule, the Appellant argues that her conduct fits within one of the exceptions of the rule recognized by the Commonwealth Court in Setley v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 69 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 241, 451 A.2d 10 (1982). Setley represents a codification of our own law in this area and stands for the proposition that\n... an injury sustained while an employee is going to or coming from work does not occur in the course of employment unless one of the following exceptions is shown to exist:\n1) claimant\u2019s employment contract includes transportation to and from work;\n2) claimant has no fixed place of work;\n3) claimant is on a special mission for employer; or\n4) special circumstances are such that claimant was furthering the business of the employer.\nId., 69 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. at 244, 451 A.2d at 11.\nThe Appellant asserts that her trip to Montefiore Hospital constituted a special mission for her employer and that she had no permanent, or fixed, place of work. However, the Board disagreed and found the assignment to work at Montefiore Hospital did not constitute a \u201cspecial mission for the employer\u201d. Although the Board agreed that the Appellant had no permanent, or fixed, place of work, it concluded that she had a fixed place of employment each day. Hence, the Board concluded that the Appellant was no different than any other employee who travelled to Montefiore Hospital each day, and determined that exception number two (of Setley) only applies to situations where the employee travels during her workday.\nThe Commonwealth Court affirmed this decision. It concluded that Appellant\u2019s injuries were not compensable since her contract did not include reimbursement for her transportation expenses, and rejected the Appellant\u2019s assertion that she was on a special mission, because it found nothing special about a daily commute to work. The Appellee\u2019s requirement that its employees dress at home was nothing more than the performance of incidental, work-related, functions prior to a commute, and the Appellant\u2019s argument that she had no fixed place of work each day failed because she did not travel from location to location during her workday. In conclusion, the court did not consider her situation any different from any other employee, who travelled to work each day, labored through her work day at a specific office, and then returned home at the end of the day.\nWe accepted Allocatur to review this area of the law and, now, reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court.\nDISCUSSION\nWe have already noted that our law begins with the understanding that an employer is not liable to its employee for compensation for injuries received off the employer\u2019s premises, while the employee is travelling to or from work. This rule was first qualified in the case of Campagna v. Ziskind, 287 Pa. 403, 135 A. 124 (1926), where we extended the employer\u2019s responsibility to the employee who is engaged beyond his employer\u2019s premises to further his employer\u2019s business. See, Campagna, supra. An exception was also found to arise where there is some special duty undertaken for, and directed by, the employer. See, Butrin, supra. Yet, this duty must not be an act done for the mere convenience of the employee, but by order of the employer, express or implied. See, Cronin v. American Oil Co., 298 Pa. 336, 148 A. 476 (1929). Likewise, a claimant is considered to be within the course of his employment where his travel, which is an essential part of his work in furtherance of his employer\u2019s business, is reimbursed by the employer. See, Hohman, supra.\nThe Appellee rests its argument upon the general rule and urges this court to classify this Appellant in the same category as any other employee employed by Montefiore Hospital. It insists that the Appellant does not fall within any of the created exceptions. More specifically, the Appellee illustrates its argument by raising the following points: 1) The assignment to Montefiore Hospital constituted a fixed place of work; 2) The Appellee neither compensated Appellant for her transportation expenses, nor did it pay her for her travel time; 3) The Appellant\u2019s journey to work did not constitute a special mission since she exercised her right to accept this work assignment; And, 4) the Appellant\u2019s acceptance of this assignment did not create any special circumstances wherein she was furthering her employer\u2019s business. According to the Appellee, all of its employees fall within the parameters of the general rule unless the employee receives compensation for her travel. To support this statement, the Appellee directs our attention to cases interpreted by the Commonwealth Court.\nWe reject this argument because it ignores our test for determining whether, or not, an employee\u2019s injury is covered under the worker\u2019s compensation law. The question is not whether the employee was compensated for the service performed before or after the hours of employment; instead, the issue is whether this claimant has a fixed place of work. In determining this question, we must keep in mind that the Pennsylvania Worker\u2019s Compensation Act is remedial in nature and intended to benefit the worker, and, therefore, the Act must be liberally construed to effectuate its humanitarian objectives. Krawchuk v. Philadelphia Electric Co., 497 Pa. 115, 439 A.2d 627 (1981); Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board v. Overmyer Mold Co., 473 Pa. 369, 374 A.2d 689 (1977); Kransky v. Glen Alden Coal Co., 354 Pa. 425, 47 A.2d 645 (1946); Ginther v. J.P. Graham Transfer Co., 348 Pa. 60, 33 A.2d 923 (1943).\nThe Pennsylvania Worker\u2019s Compensation Act dictates, \u201cevery employer shall be liable for compensation for personal injury to ... each employee, [for] an injury in the course of his employment ...\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 431. Moreover,\nThe term \u201cinjury,\u201d ... shall be construed to mean an injury to an employee ... arising in the course of his employment.... The term \u201cinjury arising in the course of his employment,\u201d as used in this article ... shall include all injuries sustained while the employe is actually engaged in the furtherance of the business or affairs of the employer, whether upon the employer\u2019s premises or elsewhere....\n77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1).\nReviewing the facts of this record, we note that Appellee, an agency in business to supply personnel to health care facilities on a temporary basis, maintains an inventory of personnel. When Montefiore Hospital contacted the Appellee, it selected from its personnel list an individual it believed best suited for the particular job and directed the Appellant to travel to Montefiore Hospital.\nRegardless of this Appellee\u2019s attempt to disguise the true nature of its employees\u2019 status, by assigning them to work assignments one week in advance, the facts of the matter remain the same: A temporary employee, who is employed by an agency, never has a fixed place of work. Consequently, when the agency employee travels to an assigned workplace, the employee is furthering the business of the agency. Therefore, we conclude, as a matter of law, Appellant had no fixed place of work, when she was injured, and her injury occurred while she was in furtherance of her employer\u2019s business.\nAccordingly, our law requires that Appellant be awarded benefits.\nReversed and case remanded to the Commonwealth Court for further disposition.\nNIX, C.J., concurs in the result.\nFLAHERTY, J., files a dissenting opinion in which ZAPPALA, J., joins.\n. Since the Commonwealth Court affirmed the dismissal of the Appellant\u2019s claim petition, it did not discuss any of the subrogation or credit issues which arose out of the Appellant\u2019s third party recovery against the driver of the other automobile, nor did it discuss the medical or work loss benefits paid to the Appellant under her own no-fault automobile insurance policy."}
