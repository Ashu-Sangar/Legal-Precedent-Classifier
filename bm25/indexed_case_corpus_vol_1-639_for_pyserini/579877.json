{"id": "579877", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nAppellant instituted this action for wrongful death and survival in the Court of Common Pleas, Dauphin County, and named as defendants: The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, the individual members of the Board, the Director of State Stores, and the manager of a specific State Store.\nAppellant alleged that the decedent, a sixteen-year-old boy, purchased a bottle of Scotch whiskey from a State Store. The boy consumed part of the bottle, became drunk, and, as a result of his intoxicated condition, fell eleven floors from a fire escape to his death.\nThe Attorney General filed preliminary objections, averring that the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is an instrumentality and agency of the Commonwealth; that an action against the Board is an action against the Commonwealth; that the Commonwealth cannot be sued without its consent; and that there has been no such consent in this case. Appellant answered these preliminary objections.\nThe proceeding was transferred subsequently to the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania, where the Attorney General\u2019s preliminary objections were sustained, with two judges dissenting, Biello v. Pa. Liquor Control Bd., 1 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 179 (1971), and the complaint was dismissed; this appeal followed.\nThis case raises the question of the immunity of an agency of the state from actions in tort.\nThe doctrine of sovereign immunity arrived in Pennsylvania in Respublica v. Sparhawk, 1 Dallas 357 (1788). That case was a suit to recover the value of flour relocated by the Pennsylvania War Board pursuant to a legislative directive to prevent British capture of supplies should they occupy Philadelphia.\nThe plaintiff in Sparhawk did not contend \u201cthat, generally speaking, citizens may sue the State; but only that every Government, which is not absolutely despotic, has provided some means (in England, for instance, by petition in Chancery) to obtain a redress of injuries from the sovereign.\u201d 1 Dallas at 361.\nChief Justice M\u2019Kean responded by affirming the legislature\u2019s right to order relocation of private belongings when the necessity of war demands. He was not impressed with the plaintiff\u2019s plea that the loss be spread. \u201cIt is a rule, however, that it is better to suffer a private mischief, than a public inconvenience; and the rights of necessity form a part of our law.\u201d 1 Dallas at 362.\nSparhawk was extended in John Black v. Rempublicam, 1 Yeates 110 (1792), a case in which Pennsylvania galley captains had seized private provisions while fleeing from the British across the Delaware River. The captains used the provisions to feed their own troops and promised the landowner compensation. The court held that since the captains had no authority to contract, there could be no recovery in contract, and, further that Sparhawk precluded recovery in tort.\nWere sovereign immunity a creature of pure common law, we might be disposed to a consideration of the abrogation of that much criticized doctrine. However, Article I, Section 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides, inter alia: \u201cSuits may be brought against the Commonwealth in such manner, in such courts and in such cases as the Legislature may by law direct.\u201d This language consistently has been interpreted to mean that no suit may be maintained against the state in tort until the legislature specifically has provided for such an action. Meagher v. Commonwealth, 439 Pa. 532, 266 A. 2d 684 (1970); Bannard v. N.Y.S. Nat. Gas Corp., 404 Pa. 269, 172 A. 2d 306 (1961); Brewer v. Commonwealth, 345 Pa. 144, 27 A. 2d 53 (1942); Bell Telephone Co. v. Lewis, 313 Pa. 374, 169 A. 571 (1934); Collins v. Commonwealth, 262 Pa. 572, 106 A. 229 (1919); Fitler v. Commonwealth, 31 Pa. 406 (1858). Pennsylvania is thus consistent with the majority of the states of this nation who have refused to treat similar constitutional provisions as being self-executing. The rationale seems to have been that such a constitutional provision must be strictly construed since it is in derogation of the states\u2019 inherent exemption from suit.\nThe question of whether a particular action is one against the Commonwealth is not to be determined solely by reference to the nominal parties to the record. Rader v. Pa. Turnpike Commission, 407 Pa. 609, 182 A. 2d 199 (1962); Merchants\u2019 Co. v. Gelder, 349 Pa. 1, 36 A. 2d 444 (1944); Bell Telephone Co. v. Lewis, supra.\nIn Rader, this Court held: \u201cthat the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission [is] an instrumentality of the Commonwealth engaged in a governmental function and therefore is not liable for . . . injuries and damages in a trespass action.\u201d At page 611. (Emphasis in original.) We subsequently approved of immunity for agencies engaged in governmental function in Thomas v. Baird, 433 Pa. 482, 252 A. 2d 653 (1969) (Turnpike Authority); Roney v. General State Authority, 413 Pa. 218, 196 A. 2d 349 (1964) (General State Authority); and in Anderson Appeal, 408 Pa. 179, 182 A. 2d 514 (1962) (Delaware River Port Authority).\nWhile in Pennsylvania we have not before expressly employed the distinction between governmental and proprietary functions when considering the sovereign immunity doctrine, it has nonetheless been implicitly present in our application of the doctrine. In many of our decisions where we have found the bar to exist, we have noted that the function being performed was a governmental one. Roney v. General State Authority, supra; Anderson Appeal, supra; Rader v. Pa. Turnpike Commission, supra, and Merchants\u2019 Co. v. Gelder, supra.\nIn accepting the distinction between governmental and proprietary functions, we are appreciative of the difficulties experienced by our courts using this distinction in the context of the governmental immunity cases and are mindful of the warning of Mr. Justice Cohen that \u201cperhaps there is no issue known to the law which is surrounded by more confusion.\u201d Morris v. Mt. Lebanon Twp. Sch. Dist., 393 Pa. 633, 637, 144 A. 2d 737 (1958). See also Mr. Justice Musmanno\u2019s dissent in Boorse v. Springfield Twp., 377 Pa. 109, 103 A. 2d 708 (1954).\nThe sole issue remaining is whether the Liquor Control Board was acting in a governmental or proprietary capacity when it sold young Joseph Biello a bottle of whiskey. In Merchants\u2019 Co. v. Gelder, supra, a case where a warehouseman sought contractual relief against the Liquor Control Board for liquor storage, we held that the State could prescribe the manner and procedure to be used in such suits because the Board enjoyed the State\u2019s immunity. In Gelder, the court reasoned that the Board, while storing whiskey as a wholesaler, was performing an essentially governmental function under the exhaustive set of regulations set forth in our Liquor Code. Act of April 12, 1951, P. L. 90, Art. I, \u00a7101 et seq., 47 P.S. \u00a71-101 et seq. We are unable to distinguish Gelder from the instant case. The retail sale of liquor herein engaged in by the board is as much a part of the Commonwealth\u2019s comprehensive scheme to regulate the sale and consumption of alcohol as is storing the alcohol for distribution to the state stores, the activity in question in Gelder.\nWe do not believe, as appellant contends, that the Commonwealth is in the liquor business solely in order to raise revenue. If revenue were, in fact, the real purpose for the Liquor Control Board\u2019s activities, it would not need to operate all retail outlets. Instead, a tax in the nature of a sales tax could have been enacted to raise all necessary revenue without the concommitant regulation.\nAppellant also argues that by enacting \u00a7493(1) of the Liquor Code [47 P.S. \u00a74-493(1)], the Legislature has, in the language of Article I, Section 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, \u201cdirected\u201d that the Commonwealth may be sued in cases such as this. Section 493(1) of the Liquor Code provides: \u201cIt shall be unlawful ... [f]or . . . the board, or any employe, servant or agent of . . . the board ... to sell . . . any liqnor ... to any minor. . . .\u201d\nAccording to appellant\u2019s argument, the only possible explanation for the Legislature\u2019s having made it unlawful for the Board to sell liquor to minors was to indicate that the Board could be held civilly liable for the consequences of such sales, since no criminal sanctions are imposed. However, Article I, Section 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution indicates that if the Commonwealth is to be liable to suit, the Legislature must direct the \u201cmanner and courts\u201d in which such suits may be brought, as well as the types of cases in which suit is permitted. We do not believe that the enactment of \u00a7493(1) of the Liquor Code is the type of \u201cdirection\u201d which the Constitution requires.\nConsequently, because we believe that this case is controlled by G-elder, Article I, Section 11 of the Pennsylvania Constitution requires that we affirm. Were this a case of first impression, we might interpret the language otherwise. However, the interpretation given by our courts is steeped in historical precedent apparently concurred in by the Legislature and the people of Pennsylvania, in that no effort has been made over the years to change the provision. We, therefore, believe that the meaning of this provision, interpreted as it has been for so long and so consistently, can now only be appropriately changed by legislative action.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Manderino took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nMr. Justice Eagen and Mr. Justice Pomeroy concur in the result.\nFor a comprehensive list of states that have judicially abrogated sovereign and/or governmental immunity, see the dissents of Mr. Justice Roberts in Smeltz v. Harrisburg, 440 Pa. 224, 269 A. 2d 466 (1970), and Thomas v. Baird, 433 Pa. 482, 252 A. 2d 653 (1969).\nFor criticism of the injustice wrought by the doctrine, see the dissents of Mr. Justice Roberts in Flinchbaugh v. Cornwall-Leb. Sch. Dist., 438 Pa. 407, 264 A. 2d 708 (1970), and Laughner v. Allegheny County, 436 Pa. 572, 261 A. 2d 607 (1970), and the dissent of Mr. Justice Musmanno in Rader v. Pa. Turnpike Commission, 407 Pa. 609, 182 A. 2d 199 (1962).\nSee 81 C.J.S., States, \u00a7215, page 1304. For a complete list of jurisdictions so holding, see Krause v. State, 31 Ohio St. 2d 132, 141, 285 N.E. 2d 736 (1972), and Raudabaugh v. State, 96 Ohio St. 513, 118 N.E. 102 (1917).\nThe obvious legislative solution, chosen by such states as New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Nevada, California and Illinois, is a comprehensive tort claims statute. In the past, appeals to our Legislature to follow their example have invariably fallen upon deaf ears. See, e.g., Supler v. N. Franklin Twp. Sell. Dist., 407 Pa. 657, 660, 182 A. 2d 535 (1962); Stouffer v. Morrison, 400 Pa. 497, 162 A. 2d 378 (1960); Morris v. Mt. Lebanon Twp. Sch. Dist., 393 Pa. 633, 635, 144 A. 2d 737 (1958). We can only Rope that they will now see the wisdom of such action."}
