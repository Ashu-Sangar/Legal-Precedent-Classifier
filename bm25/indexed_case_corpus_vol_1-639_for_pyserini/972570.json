{"id": "972570", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThis case does not require discussion. It is sufficient to say that the plaintiff below made out a prima facie case, and the defendant offered nothing to rebut it. The matters alleged by her learned counsel, and which are indicated to some extent in his points, were matters of defence, so far as they had any bearing upon the case; and, no proof having been offered in their support, the court below committed no error in disregarding them.\nJudgment affirmed."}
