{"id": "1240351", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThis is an appeal by the Commonwealth from an order of the court of common pleas setting aside a suspension by the Secretary of Revenue of an operator\u2019s license for operating a motor vehicle. The offense charged was speed on a public highway at seventy miles per hour where the maximum lawful speed limit was fifty miles per hour.\nWhat we said in Commonwealth v. Emerick, 373 Pa. 388, 96 A. 2d 370, relating to legal principles and the construction of The Vehicle Code, has similar application to the facts in the present case.\nGeorge W. Roher, defendant, was charged by a state policeman with traveling on a state highway on May 25, 1951, at 12:30 p.m., at seventy miles per hour. Defendant\u2019s car was stopped at a' red light, with the state police car and two others in line behind him. Some one called from defendant\u2019s car, \u201cDo you want to race\u201d? Upon the change of light defendant raced along the highway, ignoring and passing through a thirty-five-mile-an-hour speed' sign, and was \u201cclocked\u201d at' 70 miles per hour. Defendant was twenty-six years of age, married, with two children, and had been licensed for nearly 11 years. The reason he assigns for the violation was \u201cto g\u00e9t to work.\u201d He testified that-he had -never- been arrested before. He said he was not watching the speedometer bnt did pass \u201ca lot of cars.\u201d\nThe learned court below revoked the Secretary of Revenue\u2019s order of suspension solely upon the ground of economic hardship. In the order the court said: \u201c. . . it appears that the petitioner has been a licensed operator for better than ten years, and that the present speeding charge is the sole violation on his driving record.\n\u201cThe testimony further discloses that there was no accident at the time of the speeding charge.\n\u201cIt further appears from the testimony that the petitioner is a married man with children and is the operator of a sawmill, and that he would be unable to operate his business without a driver\u2019s license.\u201d\nSuch an order, in the circumstances of this case, constitutes a manifest abuse of discretion.\nThe order is reversed at the cost of the appellee."}
