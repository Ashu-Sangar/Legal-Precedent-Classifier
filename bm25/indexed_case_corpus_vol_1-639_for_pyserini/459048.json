{"id": "459048", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chiee Justice Maxey,\nThis was an action in trespass based upon an alleged assault and battery. After trial the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $3,500. The defendant moved for a new trial. This was refused; hence this appeal. Several of the assignments of error are based upon the admission in evidence, over defendant\u2019s objection, of the Quarter Sessions\u2019 record of this same defendant\u2019s indictment for aggravated assault and battery against this prosecutor and his conviction under that indictment, the criminal prosecution arising from the same facts as this civil action. The record of the defendant\u2019s indictment and conviction of the charge of mayhem against this prosecutor was also admitted over defendant\u2019s objection. Testimony of Commonwealth witnesses at the above criminal trials was also admitted over defenidant\u2019s objection. This entire record is replete with these and similar errors.\nIt is settled that in a civil action to recover damages from an assault and battery the record of the defendant\u2019s conviction in a criminal court of the same charge of assault and battery against the prosecutor is not admissible. See Porter v. Seiler, 23 Pa. 424, 62 Am. Dec. 431 and 4 Am. Juris., sec. 156, p. 199.\nThe judgment is reversed, with a venire."}
