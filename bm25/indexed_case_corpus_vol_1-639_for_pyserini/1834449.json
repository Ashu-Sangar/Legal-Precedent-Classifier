{"id": "1834449", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nIn 1989, in the Court of Common Pleas of York County, the appellant, Pedro Corporan, was convicted of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Appellant was sentenced to three to six years imprisonment, and a fine of fifteen thousand dollars was imposed. An appeal was taken to the Superior Court, whereupon the judgment of sentence was affirmed. 406 Pa.Super. 660, 583 A.2d 830. The present appeal, by allowance, ensued. We affirm.\nThe three year minimum term of imprisonment and fifteen thousand dollar fine imposed upon appellant was prescribed by the mandatory sentencing provision in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508(a)(3)(ii). The issue presented in this appeal is whether the sentencing provision was properly applied.\nAppellant was convicted for being in possession of a mixture of powder containing cocaine. By its express terms, the mandatory sentencing provision is to be applied when possession of the controlled substance has involved a quantity of the substance having a specified minimum weight, to wit, ten grams. There was no evidence in this case that the cocaine itself, as opposed to the mixture of cocaine and powdered cutting agents, met that weight requirement. The total weight of the powder, containing cocaine, that was seized from appellant was 14.19 grams. The weight of the pure cocaine contained in that powder is not known.\nAppellant contends that the mandatory sentencing provision applies only where the weight of the pure cocaine seized meets the ten gram requirement, rather than where the weight of the mixture of cocaine and cutting agent together meets that requirement. We do not agree. Such a contention is plainly contrary to the express language of the statute.\nWhen appellant was sentenced, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508(a) provided in pertinent part as follows:\n(3) A person who is convicted of violating section 13(a)(14) or (30) of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act where the controlled substance is coca leaves or is any salt, compound, derivative or preparation of coca leaves or is any salt, compound, derivative or preparation which is chemically equivalent or identical with any of these substances or is any mixture containing any of these substances except decocainized coca leaves or extracts of coca leaves which (extracts) do not contain cocaine or ecgonine shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment and a f\u00edne as set forth in this subsection:\n(ii) upon the first conviction when the amount of the substance involved is at least ten grams and less than 100 grams; three years in prison and a fine of $15,000----\n(Emphasis added).\nThis is not a case where the meaning of the statute in question is ambiguous, such that we would need to search for legislative history or resort extensively to rules of statutory construction to discern the legislative intent. When the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, it must be given effect in accordance with its plain and common meaning. Commonwealth v. Larkin, 518 Pa. 225, 232-33, 542 A.2d 1324, 1328 (1988); Commonwealth v. Bell, 512 Pa. 334, 339-40, 516 A.2d 1172, 1175 (1986); Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). See also 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 105 (provisions of the Crimes Code (Title 18) are to be construed according to the \u201cfair import\u201d of their terms).\nWhen there has been a conviction for possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508(a)(3)(h) requires that a three year minimum sentence of imprisonment and a fine of $15,000 be imposed \u201cwhen the amount of the substance involved is at least ten grams.... \u201d (Emphasis added). Appellant contends that the weight of the \u201csubstance\u201d should be determined without including the weight of the cutting agent, i.e., that it is the weight of the cocaine rather than the weight of the mixture containing cocaine that is determinative. Such a contention, however, ignores the plain definition that the same statutory provision accords to the term \u201csubstance.\u201d\nIn 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508(a)(3), supra, it is expressly stated that the mandatory minimum sentence shall apply \u201cwhere the controlled substance is coca leaves or is any ... preparation of coca leaves ... or is any mixture containing any of these substances.... \u201d (Emphasis added). The legislature could not have been more clear in expressing that, for purposes of the sentencing statute, a preparation or mixture containing cocaine is to be counted as a \u201csubstance.\u201d This reflects the legislature\u2019s awareness that cocaine is commonly possessed and circulated in a mixture containing cocaine and adulterants which serve as cutting agents. Within the same statutory provision, at subparagraph (3)(ii), supra, reference to the weight of the \u201csubstance\u201d must be taken as referring to the same substance, namely the pure cocaine or any preparation or mixture thereof. To conclude otherwise would be to accord the term \u201csubstance\u201d two different definitions within the same statutory provision, a result which would be both unreasonable and unsupported by any language in the statute. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1) (legislature cannot be presumed to intend an absurd or unreasonable result).\nAppellant\u2019s contention is essentially that subparagraph (3)(ii) of the statute should be construed as though it used the term \u201cpure cocaine\u201d rather than \u201csubstance\u201d in describing the material to be weighed. The language chosen by the legislature, however, is controlling. \u201cSubstance\u201d is expressly defined in the statute to include a \u201cpreparation\u201d or \u201cmixture.\u201d If the legislature had not intended to include preparations and mixtures containing cocaine as substances whose weights could trigger the mandatory sentencing provision, it would have made reference to the weight of the cocaine rather than the weight of the \u201csubstance\u201d as the triggering factor for imposition of a mandatory sentence. See Commonwealth v. Perez, 397 Pa.Super. 574, 580 A.2d 781 (1990) (weight of the mixture containing cocaine, rather than weight of the pure cocaine contained therein, triggers application of mandatory sentencing under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508(a)(3)).\nThus, the Superior Court properly held that, based upon the clear and unambiguous language of the statute, the mandatory sentencing provision can be triggered by the weight of a mixture in which cocaine has been combined with a cutting agent. Inasmuch as appellant was found to be in possession of 14.19 grams of such a mixture, he was properly sentenced under the provision in question.\nOrder affirmed.\nZAPPALA, J., concurs in the result.\nCAPPY, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nThe quoted portion of the statute is that which was in effect at all times relevant to this case. The statute was revised by the legislature in 1990, and the revision clearly expresses that the weight of the mixture, as opposed to the weight of the pure cocaine, is the factor upon which application of the sentencing provision depends. The legislature retained, therefore, a clear focus upon the weight of the mixture as opposed to the weight of the cocaine as the determinative factor."}
