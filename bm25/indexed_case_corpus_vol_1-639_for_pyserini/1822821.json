{"id": "1822821", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThis appeal raises two questions. The first is whether it is constitutional for Appellant to have his probation revoked and be sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on new charges that were ultimately dismissed. The second question is whether it is constitutional for a court to sentence Appellant to a term of imprisonment for a probation violation when the term of probation had expired. Both the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA) court and Superior Court answered these questions in the affirmative. We granted review and now reverse.\nOn March 27, 1974, Appellant, Melvin Royster, was convicted of robbery, burglary and two firearms offenses following a bench trial before the Honorable Alex Bonavitacola of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. The same day, Appellant was sentenced to eleven and one-half to twenty-three months imprisonment for the robbery conviction and upon completion of that sentence to three concurrent terms of five years probation for the remaining counts.\nWhile serving his probationary sentence, Appellant was arrested on July 26, 1980 and charged with robbery, simple assault and attempted theft. A preliminary hearing was held on September 25, 1980 after which he was bound over for court on all the charges. The following month a probation detainer was filed against Appellant based on Judge Bonavitacola\u2019s original sentence. The only basis noted in the Probation Department\u2019s hearing summary filed in support of the detainer was the pending disposition of robbery charges against Appellant. No technical violation of probation was cited.\nOn June 26, 1981, Appellant was convicted on all the new charges before the Honorable Herbert R. Cain, sitting without a jury. Appellant timely filed post-verdict motions which were deferred pending completion of a pre-sentence report.\nNotwithstanding the deferral of a ruling on the post-verdict motions, a violation of probation hearing was held on September 9, 1981 before Judge Bonavitacola. Appellant\u2019s motion for a continuance based upon Judge Cain not having ruled on Appellant\u2019s post-trial motions, was denied. The sole Commonwealth witness, Appellant\u2019s probation officer, testified as to the procedural history of the case and that Appellant had been convicted on June 26, 1981 of new charges. N.T. 9-9-81 pp. 10-13. The trial court, assistant district attorney, and Appellant\u2019s counsel also discussed on the record that in 1976 Appellant had been found to be in violation of probation although his probation was continued. N.T. 9-9-81 pp. 19-20; see also Note 2, supra. Based on the evidence presented, Appellant was found to be in violation of probation and thus his probation was revoked. Judge Bonavitacola sentenced him to three concurrent terms of imprisonment of one to five years.\nEight months after the probation revocation hearing, Judge Cain granted Appellant\u2019s post-trial motion on double jeopardy grounds. Judge Cain then entered an order dated May 6, 1982 arresting judgment on Appellant\u2019s 1981 convictions. The Commonwealth took no appeal.\nOn September 19, 1985, Appellant filed a petition for relief under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, (PCHA) 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9541 et seq. Following an evidentiary hearing, the PCHA court denied Appellant\u2019s petition. Appeal was taken to Superior Court which affirmed the PCHA court\u2019s order. 549 A.2d 1343.\nAppellant\u2019s first contention is that it was unconstitutional for him to be found in violation of probation and sentenced to prison where the charges constituting the violation were ultimately dismissed.\nSuperior Court, relying on our decision in Commonwealth v. Kates, 452 Pa. 102, 305 A.2d 701 (1973), and also citing to Commonwealth v. Fleeger, 292 Pa.Super. 310, 437 A.2d 60 (1981), concluded that a defendant may have his/her probation revoked based upon the existence of charges being brought, even though subsequently the person is acquitted of those charges. Although recognizing that Appellant\u2019s conviction on the new charges was dismissed, Superior Court found that the circumstances surrounding his arrest were discussed before the trial judge at the violation of probation hearing. The court, therefore, concluded that the trial judge was presented with ample evidence to establish that Appellant\u2019s term of probation was not effective in rehabilitating and deterring Appellant against further antisocial conduct. Additionally, Superior Court noted that Judge Cain\u2019s order arresting judgment on Appellant\u2019s 1981 convictions was based not on a finding that the evidence was insufficient to establish that Appellant committed the criminal acts charged, but solely upon double jeopardy grounds. Superior Court Memorandum Opinion pp. 2-4. This analysis is fatally flawed because it ignores our decision in Commonwealth v. Brown, 503 Pa. 514, 469 A.2d 1371 (1983).\nIn Brown, the Commonwealth instituted proceedings for revocation of defendant\u2019s probation based on charges of which he had been acquitted. The trial court revoked defendant\u2019s probation and he appealed. Superior Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order. After granting appeal and hearing argument, we held that the probation revocation court was barred by collateral estoppel from returning a finding of probation revocation based upon defendant\u2019s alleged participation in a crime where the probation revocation hearing was deferred until after trial of the criminal case which resulted in an acquittal.\nMr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Nix writing for the Court in Brown, rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that we would be justified in ignoring applicability of the collateral estoppel rule even though both proceedings share the identical ultimate issue of fact since the purposes sought to be achieved in a revocation of probation hearing are different from those sought to be obtained in the trial of the substantive offense. It was reasoned that\nIn both proceedings the sanction of loss of liberty is involved. Where, as here, the sole basis offered for the violation of probation is the commission of a subsequent offense, the threshold issue in both proceedings is exactly the same, i.e., did the probationer commit the offense. Pertinent is an observation made in United States ex rel Burgess v. Lindsey, 395 F.Supp. 404, 410\n(E.D.Pa.1975) discussing an analogous matter:\nWhen the Board is called upon to deal with a parolee whose only alleged parole violation is the commission of a new crime, however, its role changes significantly. No longer is it the finder of fact. Indeed, at the first stage of the final revocation process, it is not a finder of fact at all. The crucial and \u201cwholly retrospective factual question\u201d that must be answered, Morrissey v. Brewer, supra, 408 U.S. [471] at 479, 92 S.Ct. 2593 [at 2599, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) ] is whether a parolee has in fact committed a new crime. The Board does not answer that question; the criminal justice system does____\n******\nThus, the final parole revocation inquiry envisioned by the Court in Morrissey cannot properly begin until the Board learns whether or not the parolee has violated his parole. The Board does not learn that fact until the guilt or innocence of the parolee has been determined within the criminal justice system.\nId. 503 Pa. at 525-526, 469 A.2d at 1376 (emphasis added).\nA review of the record reveals that Appellant\u2019s probation officer testified at the September 9, 1981 violation of probation hearing that Appellant was convicted on June 26, 1981 of attempted theft, simple assault and robbery. Based on the seriousness of the charges and the offenses committed she recommended that Appellant\u2019s probation be revoked. N.T. 9-9-81, pp. 11-12.\nNotwithstanding this evidence, Superior Court found that the discussion before the judge as to the circumstances surrounding Appellant\u2019s arrest presented ample evidence to establish that Appellant\u2019s probation had proven to be an ineffective vehicle to accomplish rehabilitation and not sufficient to deter against future antisocial conduct. See Commonwealth v. Burrell, 497 Pa. 367, 441 A.2d 744 (1980). The discussion relating to Appellant\u2019s July 26, 1980 arrest which involved Assistant District Attorney McGill is as follows:\nTHE COURT: What are the facts?\nMR. MC GILL: The man, a 57-year-old man is leaving a State Store and he is attacked from behind. He is injured, although no hospitalization is required. Apparently while he was walking away the defendant grabbed the man on the back of his neck and had thrown him down to the ground. And then he went for his money in his pocket. The area right where he had placed his money prior\u2014\nTHE COURT: What we commonly call a mugging.\nMR. MC GILL: That\u2019s right, Judge, a mugging.\nTHE COURT: Was he convicted of robbery, F-2?\nN.T. 9-9-81, p. 15. .\nContrary to Superior Court\u2019s characterization, Assistant District Attorney McGill\u2019s recitation of the facts underlying Appellant\u2019s 1981 convictions is not evidence since it is well settled that he cannot, as the Commonwealth\u2019s advocate at the proceedings, present his own testimony as to the facts. By electing not to present any direct evidence as to Appellant\u2019s specific criminal acts, the Commonwealth took a calculated risk that his conviction would not be overturned in the post-trial motions.\nWe find, therefore, that the sole basis the Commonwealth offered for Appellant\u2019s violation of probation was the fact that he had been convicted on June 26, 1981 of new charges. Because the trial court arrested judgment on the conviction, the Commonwealth cannot be found to have established by a preponderance of the evidence that Appellant committed the offense. Revocation of probation and re-sentencing Appellant to a term of imprisonment was therefore improper.\nAppellant\u2019s second issue concerns the constitutionality of the court\u2019s imposition of a sentence for violation of probation where the term of probation had expired at the time of the imposition of sentence. Because Appellant could have raised the issue on appeal from imposition oof sentence, he has waived his right to raise it under the Post Conviction Hearing Act. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b).\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the Superior Court is reversed and the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County imposed as the result of the probation revocation hearing is vacated.\nJurisdiction Relinquished.\nLARSEN and McDERMOTT, JJ., dissent.\n. Appellant was given six months credit for the time served since his arrest on September 27, 1973. Expiration of parole was to occur on August 27, 1975. The probation term was scheduled to expire on August 27, 1980.\n. Appellant was paroled from his robbery sentence in September, 1974 after serving the minimum sentence. On April 29, 1975, Appellant was arrested and charged with aggravated robbery, theft, receiving stolen property, theft by unlawful taking and disposition, reckless endangerment, terroristic threats and criminal conspiracy. A probation department detainer was lodged but Judge Savitt dismissed the charges pursuant to Rule 1100 on December 23, 1975. Prior to the violation of probation hearing on his 1974 convictions, Appellant had a violation of probation hearing before Judge Richette who continued his probation on January 22, 1976 and a violation of parole hearing before Judge Gelfand on March 1, 1976 who continued parole. At the aforementioned probation hearing, Judge Bonavitacola, on March 12, 1976 continued Appellant\u2019s parole and probation.\nAppellant was again arrested on July 8, 1976 and charged with theft by unlawful taking and disposition as well as receiving stolen property. On August 30, 1976, Appellant appeared before Judge Silverstein and was found guilty of receiving stolen property. He was sentenced to two years probation with a special condition that he remain in prison until accepted at Eagleville Hospital. Based on the conviction a violation of probation hearing was held before Judge Bonavitacola on November 22, 1976. Judge Bonavitacola continued Appellant\u2019s probation on his 1974 convictions. See N.T. 10-9-73; N.T. 3-12-76 and N.T. 11-12-76.\n. A prior bench trial on these charges before the Honorable Leon Katz ended when Appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was granted on March 28, 1981. When this matter was again scheduled for trial, Appellant filed a pre-trial motion to quash and/or dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. The Honorable William M. Marutani denied the motion on May 7, 1981. See Commonwealth\u2019s brief p. 3, n. 1.\n. The Post Conviction Hearing Act was amended by 1988, April 13, P.L. 336, No. 47, \u00a7 3 and replaced with the Post Conviction Relief Act.\n. Superior Court also ignored the fact that the sole basis the Probation Department lodged the detainer was the pending disposition of the robbery charges."}
