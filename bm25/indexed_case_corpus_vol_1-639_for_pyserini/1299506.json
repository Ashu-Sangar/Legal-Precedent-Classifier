{"id": "1299506", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nEach defendant appealed from the Order of the lower Court which dismissed their respective preliminary objections. The lower Court, after hearing, entered a preliminary injunction, but strange to say the appeals were taken only from the Orders which overruled the preliminary objections. The appeals raised a narrow question of jurisdiction \u2014 (1) did the lower Court lack jurisdiction because of want of an indispensable party, and (2) because Equity had no jurisdiction of the complaint since jurisdiction lay by statute solely and exclusively in the Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania.\nPlaintiff, which is a Pennsylvania corporation engaged in selling insurance, filed a complaint in equity against Rosenberg and World Mutual Health & Accident Insurance Co. of Pa., hereinafter referred to as \u201cWorld\u201d. Plaintiffs material averments may be thus summarized:\nRosenberg was employed by plaintiff as a sub-agent in 1951; he was thereafter promoted to sales manager and later to president of the company. In these capacities he occupied a position of trust and confidence and had access to all the records of plaintiff. When Rosenberg resigned from the plaintiff company in May, 1960, he secretly took from the files and possession of the plaintiff certain of its confidential records and data, including names, premium dates and amounts, and pertinent information concerning the active policyholders to whom plaintiff had sold insurance. These constituted a very valuable asset of plaintiff.\nPlaintiff also averred that these records and information were taken not only for Rosenberg\u2019s own benefit, but also for the benefit of the other defendant, World; that Rosenberg\u2019s conduct was made known to World, but that World acquiesced in and encouraged Rosenberg\u2019s course of conduct and knowingly received, accepted and made use of the confidential information, property and records of plaintiff for its own benefit and to the detriment of plaintiff. These averments were sufficient to justify a preliminary injunction against both Rosenberg and World, although the injunction was issued only against Rosenberg: Robinson Electronic Supervisory Co. v. Johnson, 397 Pa. 268, 154 A. 2d 494; Morgan\u2019s Home Equipment Corp. v. Martucci, 390 Pa. 618, 136 A. 2d 838; Macbeth-Evans Glass Co. v. Schnelbach, 239 Pa. 76, 86 A. 688; Restatement, Torts, \u00a7757, comment b; Restatement (2d), Agency, \u00a7396(b).\nThe list of policyholders and premium notices contained the names of customers who were also policyholders of the Fidelity Interstate Life Insurance Company, for whom plaintiff was a general agent. Fidelity was not, but defendants contend should have been joined as a party plaintiff. Plaintiff contends on the other hand that any damage which would result to Fidelity would be separate and distinct from the fraudulent appropriation and misuse of its property as well as the damage to plaintiff\u2019s property rights.\nNo question of defendants\u2019 right to appeal was raised by the parties, but \u201cIt is never too late to question a court\u2019s jurisdiction of the subject matter: Fowler v. Eddy, 110 Pa. 117, 1 A. 789;. . .\u201d: Bell Appeal, 396 Pa. 592, 597, 152 A. 2d 731. The grant or refusal of a preliminary injunction is appealable: Slott v. Plastic Fabricators, Inc., 402 Pa. 433, 167 A. 2d 306; Lindenfelser v. Lindenfelser, 385 Pa. 342, 123 A. 2d 626. However, generally speaking, an Order overruling preliminary objections is interlocutory and not appealable: Grosso v. Englert, 381 Pa. 351, 113 A. 2d 250. That general rule is, however, subject to the exception that if a question of jurisdiction is involved that question is appealable under the Act of March 5, 1925: Gardner v. Allegheny County, 382 Pa. 88, 114 A. 2d 491; Powell v. Shepard, 381 Pa. 405, 113 A. 2d 261.\nIn Gardner v. Allegheny County the Court said (pages 95-96) : \u201cThe question of indispensable parties raises a jurisdictional question and consequently may be considered under the Act of 1925: [citing cases]. In Fineman v. Cutler, 273 Pa., supra, the Court said (page 193) : \u2018\u201cOne must be joined who otherwise, not being bound, by tbe decree, might assert a demand . . . which would be inequitable after the [principal defendants\u2019] performance of a decree in favor of the plaintiff\u201d; . .\nIn Powell v. Shepard, 381 Pa., supra, the Court said (page 412) : \u201c. . . The absence of indispensable parties \u2018goes absolutely to the jurisdiction, and without their presence the court can grant no relief\u2019: Hartley v. Langkamp and Elder, 243 Pa. 550, 556, 90 A. 402. . . . And, a party is indispensable where his rights are so connected with the claims of the litigants that no decree can be made between them without impairing such rights: Hartley v. Langkamp and Elder, supra.\u201d\nFor the reasons hereinabove set forth, we find no merit in defendants\u2019 contention that Fidelity Interstate Life Insurance Company was an indispensable party.\nThe principal contention made by defendants is that plaintiff\u2019s sole and exclusive jurisdiction for the unlawful or injurious conduct alleged in the complaint is in the Insurance 'Commissioner of Pennsylvania, under The Insurance Unfair Practices Act of June 5, 1947. The Court further said in Gardner v. Allegheny County: \u201c . \u201cThe procedure prescribed by the Act of 1925 for testing jurisdiction \u2018in the court of first instance\u2019 applies to questions of jurisdiction either of the defendant or of the subject-matter: Welser v. Ealer, 317 Pa. 182, 184, 176 A. 429____\u201d . . .\u2019.\n\u201cIn Welser v. Ealer, 317 Pa., supra, this Court said (pages 183-184) : \u2018This case is before us by virtue of the provisions of the Act of 1925, P. L. 23, authorizing an appeal from the preliminary determination of the lower court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction over the defendant or of the cause of action for which suit is brought.\u201d The action is in trespass to recover damages for injuries resulting from an automobile accident. . . . Manifestly it has jurisdiction over the cause of action alleged in the statement, namely, trespass to recover damages for personal injuries. No other matters are open for inquiry in proceedings of this nature. Jurisdiction of the cause of action, as used in the statute, relates \u201csolely to the competency of the particular court to determine controversies of the general class to which the case then presented for its consideration belongs\u201d: Skelton v. Lower Merion Twp., 298 Pa. 471, 473. See also Koontz v. Messer, 314 Pa. 434:\u2019 \u201d We believe that defendants\u2019 contention that The Insurance Unfair Practices Act gives the Insurance Commissioner exclusive jurisdiction and ousts all jurisdiction from Courts of Equity, raises a question of jurisdiction under the Act of 1925, although as we shall see there is no merit in this contention.\nUnder The Insurance Unfair Practices Act of 1947, the Insurance Commissioner is given authority to regulate the business of insurance and to define the acts, methods and practices of persons engaged in the business of insurance, which constitute unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices; to make examinations thereof; to hold hearings; to make decisions as to whether there has been a violation of the Act; and to issue cease and desist orders. We are of the opinion that the Act was never intended to and does not vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Insurance -Commissioner in cases such as the present and thus oust the jurisdiction of a Court of Equity which for many years has possessed and exercised jurisdiction in cases arising out of facts on all fours with the instant case. Moreover if there were any doubt on this point it would be removed by Section 10 of The Insurance Unfair Practices Act, which provides: \u201cThe powers vested in the commissioner by this act, and the forfeiture provided for violation of an order to cease and desist made pursuant thereto, shall be in addition to any other procedures, penalties, fines or forfeitures authorized by law with respect to the methods, acts, and practices hereby declared to be unfair or deceptive.\u201d Section 10 preserves all the procedures authorized iby law and for this additional reason the Act did not destroy equitable jurisdiction in a case such as this.\nWe have considered all the contentions made by appellants but find no merit in any of them.\nThe Orders of the Court of Common Pleas are affirmed; costs to be paid by appellants.\nP. L. 23, 12 P.S. \u00a7672.\nP. L. 445, 40 PS \u00a71151.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nFor this reason White v. Young, 402 Pa. 61, 166 A. 2d 663, is distinguishable."}
