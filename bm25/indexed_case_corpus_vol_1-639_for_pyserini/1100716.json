{"id": "1100716", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 6th day of October, 2004, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is hereby granted, limited to the following issue:\nApplying the standards for appellate review set forth in Harman v. Borah, 562 Pa. 455, 756 A.2d 1116 (2000), and considering the scope of a trial court\u2019s discretion under the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, did the Superior Court err in reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of Gallagher\u2019s motion for a new trial based on its conclusion that the collateral source rule had been violated and without consideration of actual prejudice, when the evidence of payments from a collateral source was relevant to the jury\u2019s determination as to which of two defendants was Gallagher\u2019s employer and the trial court gave a cautionary instruction to the jury that the evidence should be used only for that limited purpose."}
