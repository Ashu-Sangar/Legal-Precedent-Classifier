{"id": "1022525", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered,\nby Sharswood, J.\nThe testator, Thomas P. Ash, after devising his residuary estate, real and personal, to several persons, declared that in case of the death of either of them before him, the devise or bequest should not lapse, \u201c but shall go to and be taken -by the heirs, executors or administrators of said legatees or devisees so dying, in the same manner as if the same had been specifically devised.\u201d. He was evidently aware of the distinction between real and personal estate. He has used throughout his will, the words, legally appropriate to each. All his-legacies of mere personalty are by th'e words \u201cgive and bequeath,\u201d but when he comes to the residuary clause in which he blends both his real and personal estate, he is careful to use the words, \u201c give, devise and bequeath,\u201d and adds a limitation to' \u201cheirs, executors, administrators and assigns.\u201d We may infer then that in the substituted gift for the lapsed devise, the word \u201cheirs\u201d was used in none other than its legal technical meaning. Apart, however, from this very important assistance at arriving at the true intention of the author of the disposition, it is a canon of construction settled in many cases, that the word \u201cheirs\u201d shall receive its appropriate technical sense, unless there is some language or expression which shows that it was used in the broader and more popular sense: Porter\u2019s Appeal, 9 Wright 201; Eby\u2019s Appeal, 14 Ibid. 311. In law the heirs of a man are those upon whom his lands of inheritance descend upon his death intestate. Popularly the word often includes devisees \u2014 the persons who are made heirs \u2014 hceredes facti. In the will before us it is plainly a word of purchase. It could not be otherwise, for by the very supposition of the death of the devisee before that of the testator, there was no estate in him in his lifetime to which the word could attach as a word of limitation. In this state when the word \u201cheirs\u201d is used as a word of purchase, it means \u25a0\u201c statutory heirs\u201d \u2014 those persons designated by the Intestate Act to take the estate not disposed of by last will and testament: Walker v. Walker, 4 Casey 40; Dodson v. Ball, 10 P. F. Smith 500; Aspden\u2019s Estate, 2 Wall. Jr. 368.\nIt has been strongly urged, however, that as the word \u201c executors\u201d is used the testator intended those who should be named in the last wills and testaments of his devisees. As we have no question in regard to personal estate before us, it is unnecessary to consider how the executors would take, whether as trustees for the next of kin as of an undisposed-of surplus, or for the uses of ' the will generally. We cannot consider that from his using the word \u201c executors\u201d the testator meant by \u201c heirs\u201d to include devisees. Indeed, the argument would rather seem the contrary. As he employed knowingly the terms \u201cexecutors or administrators\u201d, as to personalty, the inference would rather seem to be, that if he had meant it, he would have said \u201cheirs or devisees.\u201d , Undoubtedly the words are to be construed distributively \u2014 reddendo singula singulis, and so as \u201c executors or administrators\u201d are applicable to the personal estate, \u201c heirs\u201d standing by itself is the only term to be applied to the realty.\nThere are other reasons why, without express words indicating his intention, the testator in his substituted gift in the case of a lapse, ought not to be considered to have had reference to devisees. It is certain that no wills made by his devisees in their lifetime could have had any operation by their own force upon property not owned by them at the time of their decease. The devise'e of the predeceased devisee must therefore take in his character of devisee of the original or first testator. Hence, express words are necessary to designate him as th.e object of his bounty. But still further, non constat that the predeceased devisee would not have specifically devised this property if he had owned it when he made his will, and not have suffered it to pass by his residuary devise. In giving the property of Thomas P. Ash to the residuary devisees of Mary Ash and John Ash, it is really but a mere guess that if Mary Ash and John Ash had been the owners of the property devised to them by Thomas P. Ash at the time of their death, they would have allowed -it to pass by their general residuary devise. In fact the court is by construction making a will for them of this property. It is much better that the law should make the will; in other words, that the estate should go to those designated by the intestate laws as their heirs or next of kin.\nIn regard to the further question, whether the widow of John Ash is one of his \u201c statutory heirs,\u201d entitled to her share under the intestate laws, we consider it' to be a question of so much doubt under the provisions of the Act of April 8th 1833, Pamph. L. 316, and the cases of Thomas v. Simpson, 3 Barr 60; Shaw v. Galbraith, 7 Id. 111; Seider v. Seider, 5 Whart. 208; Schall\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 170; Helfrich v. Weaver, 11 P. F. Smith 384; Gibbons v. Fairlamb, 2 Casey 217, that a purchaser has a right to object to a title from the plaintiffs as not marketable, unless they shall procure from her a good and sufficient release of such estate or interest as she may be entitled to.\nJudgment reversed, and now judgment for the plaintiffs, upon the case stated, upon their,procuring and delivering to defendant a good and sufficient release by Elizabeth L. Ash, the widow of John Ash, of all such estate or interest as she may have in the premises."}
