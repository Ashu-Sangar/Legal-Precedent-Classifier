{"id": "1044102", "contents": "Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court\nPer Cdriam.\nThe claim here is not for damages arising from the bursting of the water-pipes laid by the city, but for the loss of the water caused by the bursting of the pipes leading to the plaintiff\u2019s houses, from the action of frost. The real claim is for the' loss of the water, and this will not implicate the city in any loss beyond the consideration paid for its use, viz., the water-rents, and these were allowed. The introduction of water by the city into private houses is not on the footing of a contract, but of a license which is paid for.\nJudgment affirmed."}
