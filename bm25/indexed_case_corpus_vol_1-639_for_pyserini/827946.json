{"id": "827946", "contents": "Per. Curiam:\nWe are not aware of any act of assembly which authorizes an appeal in this case. The division of a township is a statutory proceeding, and if the statute does not in terms give an appeal, no appeal lies. If we consider the case upon the certiorari, no error is apparent. The court below had. jurisdiction, and, so far as appears, the proceedings are regular.\nThe appeal is quashed at the costs of the appellant, and the proceedings affirmed upon the certiorari."}
