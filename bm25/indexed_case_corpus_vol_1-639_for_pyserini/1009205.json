{"id": "1009205", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, November 21st 1867, by\nThompson, J.\nThe court below erred in their allowance of interest to the appellees in this case. No more could be allowed than interest up to the day of sale. This is the uniform practice.\nIf authorities were needed for this, those cited in the appellant\u2019s paper-book, Ramsey\u2019s Appeal, 4 Watts 72, and Walton v. West, 4 Whart. 222, are sufficient. The excess of interest allowed after the sale and up to the maturity of the defendant\u2019s obligation or single bill, must be deducted, and with this exception, we think the principles of the decree are right.\nWe will therefore reverse the decree, and send it back to be. corrected in this particular.\nAnd now, November 21st 1867, decree of the court in awarding distribution to the judgment, Byers v. Crawford, is reversed, and the record is remitted, so that the said decree may be reformed according to the principles stated above, at the costs of the appellees."}
