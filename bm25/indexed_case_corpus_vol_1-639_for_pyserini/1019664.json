Miller,for a reconveyance of the coal, was accepted by the latter in payment and satisfaction of his purchase-money mortgage. It therefore followed that the said coal was real estate of the decedent, as to which he died intestate, and the decree of the court below must be affirmed.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
