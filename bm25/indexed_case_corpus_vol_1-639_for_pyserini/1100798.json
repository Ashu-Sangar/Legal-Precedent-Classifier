{"id": "1100798", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Chief Justice Moschizisker,\nThis is an appeal from a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County, affirming a decision of the register of wills, assessing inheritance tax. The facts in the case are tersely stated in the opinion of Judge Van Du-sen, of the court below, thus: \u201cA Pennsylvania testatrix owned real estate in Ohio, which she directed her executor to sell; she then [ordered it] distributed as money. The executor took out ancillary letters in Ohio and sold the real estate; he now has the proceeds in his hands as executor at the domicile, to be ultimately accounted for to our courts and to be distributed by them.\u201d On this state of facts, the court erred in allowing the tax, and this is true whether or not the will of testatrix works a conversion; so we need not discuss that point. All points of law here involved are fully disposed of in Robinson\u2019s Estate, 285 Pa. 308, and Com. v. Presbyterian Hospital, 287 Pa. 49; on those authorities\u2014\nThe decree appealed from is reversed, costs to be paid out of the estate."}
