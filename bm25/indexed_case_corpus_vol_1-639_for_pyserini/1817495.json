{"id": "1817495", "contents": "OPINION\nMcDERMOTT, Justice.\nThis appeal has evolved from a procedural morass and presents us with an opportunity to discuss the concept of forum non conveniens. The underlying facts of this case are as follows. On June 3, 1983, Lynn F. Okkerse was in a serious car accident which occurred at the intersection of New Gulph and Avon roads, located in Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County.\nSuit was instituted on Mrs. Okkerse\u2019s behalf by her husband. The Okkerse suit was filed in Philadelphia County against the following defendants: Edward J. Howe, III (the driver of the other car involved in the accident); the Ford Motor Company (the manufacturer of Mrs. Okkerse\u2019s car); George, Arthur, and Elizabeth Pfaumer (the owners of a property which was allegedly overgrown, thereby obscuring the entrance to the intersection); Lower Merion Township (the municipality which had the responsibility of exercising control over the intersection); the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (the owner of the intersection where the accident occurred); Mr. and Mrs. Michael P. Erdman (social hosts who allegedly served alcoholic beverages to defendant Howe); and twenty-two individual property owners (who allegedly owned the road which led into the intersection). In the present appeal the significant parties are the plaintiffs and some of the property owners.\nAlthough the situs of the accident was in Montgomery County the institution of suit in Philadelphia was permissible because two of the defendants, Ford Motor Company, and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, had business offices in Philadelphia. Thus, there is no jurisdictional venue issue in this case, and the issue is solely one of forum non conveniens. In resolving this issue the following procedural history is germane.\nOn June 28, 1985, owner-defendants William C. and Margaret R. Pickett, filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to the Okkerse complaint. These objections were assigned to the Honorable Alfred J. DiBona, Jr., for disposition. On July 16, 1985, owner-defendants George, Arthur, and Elizabeth Pfaumer filed preliminary objections on behalf of themselves and three other owner-defendants, raising, inter alia, issues of improper venue and the inconvenience of the Philadelphia forum. These objections were also assigned to Judge DiBona.\nThereafter, on August 5, 1985, another owner-defendant, Virginia Denison, filed preliminary objections in which she sought to include a \u201cPetition to Transfer Venue.\u201d However, for some unexplained reasons these filings were not assigned to Judge DiBona: rather, they were assigned to the Honorable Thomas White.\nOn August 27, 1985, Judge DiBona ruled on the filings which were before him: he denied the request for demurrer filed by the Picketts; and he denied the request for dismissal on improper venue grounds filed by the Pfaumers without'prejudice to the Pfaumers\u2019 rights to file a separate petition for a change of venue.\nOn September 17, 1985, the Pfaumers did file a \u201cPetition Raising a Lack of Venue and Forum Non Conveniens\u201d which was joined by the Township. This petition was also assigned to Judge DiBona.\nThen, on September 30, 1985, prior to Judge DiBona\u2019s ruling on the Pfaumers\u2019 petition, Judge White, without taking any evidence, granted the portion of Ms. Denison\u2019s filing which sought to transfer the case on forum non conveniens grounds.\nOn October 7, 1985, 372 Pa.Super. 645, 534 A.2d 1123, Judge DiBona ruled on the Pfaumers\u2019 petition to transfer, and denied the request for a transfer. The Pfaumers requested reconsideration of this order, raising the fact of Judge White\u2019s order on the Denison \u201cpetition\u201d. This request for reconsideration was denied on November 4, 1985, and the Pfaumers filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court.\nNo. 88 E.D. Appeal Docket, 1988\nUpon receiving the second appeal the Superior Court consolidated the two cases. The court held that the Pfaumers\u2019 appeal was interlocutory and thus not properly before the court. That appeal was then quashed. The Pfaumers now challenge that ruling on two grounds: that the Superi- or Court erred in its interpretation of the procedural rules, and that the trial court order on their petition was entered without that court having had jurisdiction.\nRegarding the first challenge we conclude that the Superior Court\u2019s interpretation of the rules, the analysis applied was absolutely correct. Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 311(c) permits appeals to be taken of right from orders changing venue. On the other hand, orders sustaining a plaintiff\u2019s choice of venue may only be appealed as of right where the party benefitting from the order files an election that the order shall be deemed final, or where the court states that a substantial issue of jurisdiction is presented. Pa.R.A.P. 311(b). As the Superior Court noted, neither of the latter situations existed in this case. As a consequence the Superior Court had no alternative but to find the Pfaumers\u2019 appeal interlocutory and to dismiss it.\nIn their second challenge appellants argue that Judge White\u2019s ruling on the Denison petition had the effect of transferring the entire action, and divested Judge DiBona of jurisdiction in this matter; therefore, it is contended, that Judge DiBona\u2019s decision was a nullity.\nIt is true that judges of coordinate jurisdictions sitting in the same court and in the same case should not overrule the decisions of each other. Marmara v. Rawle, 264 Pa.Super. 229, 238, 399 A.2d 750, 755 (1979). See Commonwealth v. Lagana, 510 Pa. 477, 509 A.2d 863 (1986). See also Yudacufski v. Commonwealth, Department of Transportation, 499 Pa. 605, 454 A.2d 923 (1982). We note, however, that this rule is not a matter of jurisdiction per se; rather it is a rule of sound jurisprudence based on the policy of fostering finality of pre-trial applications so that judicial economy and efficiency can be maintained. Commonwealth v. Griffin, 257 Pa.Super. 153, 157, 390 A.2d 758, 760 (1978). See Reifinger v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 315 Pa.Super. 147, 461 A.2d 839 (1983).\nJudge DiBona\u2019s ruling in the Pfaumers\u2019 petition was contrary to this jurisprudential policy, and his interpretation of Judge White\u2019s order as applying only to the Denison petition was in error. However, although we agree with the Pfaumers\u2019 position that Judge DiBona\u2019s order should not have been given effect, for the reasons stated in our discussion related to the appeal from Judge White\u2019s order the Pfaumers are not entitled to their presently requested relief, (i.e. a transfer of venue pursuant to Judge White\u2019s order). Instead, this entire matter should be returned to the Court of Common Pleas for that court to now rule on the Pfaumers\u2019 petition.\nNo. 89 E.D. Appeal Dkt. 1988\nThe Superior Court then reviewed the Okkerses\u2019 appeal from Judge White\u2019s order granting a change of venue, and held that there was no record basis upon which to sustain Judge White\u2019s order. Hence, the court was compelled to vacate it. This holding was also correct.\nOur Rules of Civil Procedure provide a plaintiff with options as to where to bring suit, and this Court has emphatically stated that the choice of forum by a plaintiff is entitled to weighty consideration. Walker v. Ohio River Co., 416 Pa. 149, 152, 205 A.2d 43, 43 (1964). Nevertheless, a plaintiffs choice of forum is not unassailable and the availability of a forum non conveniens challenge is a necessary counterbalance to insure fairness and practicality. See Ernest v. Fox Pool Corp., 341 Pa.Super. 71, 491 A.2d 154 (1985). Because, however, of the weight accorded to the plaintiffs original choice courts have held that he or she should not be deprived of the advantages presumed to come from that choice\n\u201cunless the defendant clearly adduces facts that \u2018either (1) establish such oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant as to be out of all proportion to plaintiffs convenience ... or (2) make trial in the chosen forum inappropriate because of considerations affecting the court\u2019s own private and public interest factors\u2019 [but] unless the balance is strongly in favor of the defendant, the plaintiffs choice of forum should rarely be disturbed.\"\nReyno v. Piper Aircraft, Co., 630 F.2d 149, 159 (3d Cir. 1980), citing Koster v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., 330 U.S. 518, 67 S.Ct. 828, 91 L.Ed. 1067 (1947) and Gulf Oil v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 67 S.Ct. 839, 91 L.Ed. 1055 (1947); cited with approval in Korn v. Marvin Fives Food Equipment, 362 Pa.Super. 559, 563, 524 A.2d 1380, 1384 (1987).\nThus, the party seeking a change of venue bears a heavy burden in justifying the request, and it has been consistently held that this burden includes the demonstration on the record of the claimed hardships. The Rules of Civil Procedure provide for a procedure whereby a complaining party can develop such a record, and this procedure has been recognized and endorsed by the Superior Court:\na proper procedure under Rule 1006(d)(1) necessarily implicates the requirements for petition and answer set forth in Pa.R.C.P. 206 through 209, including the taking of evidence by deposition or otherwise on disputed issues of fact\nHosiery Corporation of America v. Rich, 327 Pa.Super. 472, 475, 476 A.2d 50, 51 (1984).\nThe importance of developing this on the record evidence becomes apparent when one looks to the factors which a trial judge must consider before ordering a transfer. Those factors include:\nthe relative ease of access to sources of proof, availability of compulsory process for attendance of unwilling, and cost of obtaining attendance of willing witnesses; possibility of view of premises, if a view would be appropriate to the action; and all other practical problems that make trial of a case easy, expeditious, and inexpensive____ The court must also consider those elements in which the public has an interest and those include: problems of creating court congestion and imposing jury duty upon people of a community which has no relation to the litigation; ...\nRini v. N. Y. Central R. Co., 429 Pa. 235, 239, 240 A.2d 372, 374 (1968): Plum v. Tampax, Inc., 399 Pa. 553, 560-561, 160 A.2d 549, 553 (1960); citing Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 508-509, 67 S.Ct. 839, 843, 91 L.Ed. 1055 (1947). Finally, before a court can order a transfer it must \u201cfind that transfer is more convenient for both parties to the action or for the witnesses.\u201d Nicolosi v. Fittin, 434 Pa. 133, 135, 252 A.2d 700, 701 (1969) (emphasis in the original).\nCertainly, in the context of the present case, Ms. Denison had a reasonable basis upon which to seek a transfer of the action. However, it was improper to effect this transfer solely on the basis of her allegations of a hardship. This is especially so where the key allegations made by petitioner were specifically denied in the answer filed by the plaintiffs, thereby creating a factual controversy. Based on the above cited authority Ms. Denison was required to demonstrate how the Philadelphia forum adversely affected her ability to defend against plaintiffs cause of action; and the plaintiffs were certainly entitled to defend their choice of forum. Therefore, the Superior Court was correct in reversing Judge White\u2019s order since it was clearly based upon an1 inadequate record.\nIn summary, regarding the two issues which were properly before the Superior Court, i.e. whether the Pfaumers\u2019 appeal should have been quashed, and whether Judge White\u2019s order of transfer was supportable, the Superior Court ruled correctly. However, once having ruled on what was properly within the court\u2019s jurisdiction the case should have been remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County. Unfortunately the Superior Court did not do this.\nInstead, the court, after having quashed the Pfaumers\u2019 appeal then sought to review the merits of Judge DiBona\u2019s refusal to transfer the case. This was clearly an advisory opinion; and such an opinion is without legal effect. We, therefore, specifically disagree with that part of the Superi- or Court opinion which sought to pass judgment on Judge DiBona\u2019s refusal to order a transfer.\nIn conclusion, the confused state of the procedural history in this case has obviously contributed to difficulties which have arisen. This confusion also has necessitated a somewhat unique remedy. Ordinarily the failure of parties to sustain their burden of supporting a petition to transfer venue on forum non conveniens grounds would result in venue remaining where the plaintiff has chosen, without further opportunity to seek a transfer. However, in this case, because Judge DiBona\u2019s order was a nullity, and to avoid any possibility of a conflicting decision, we now direct that the Denison petition be consolidated with the Pfaumers\u2019 petition for consideration and disposition; and the presiding judge shall be free to rule on the consolidated petitions without regard to prior orders which have now been vacated or reversed.\nAccordingly for the above stated reasons the order of the Superior Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and the matter is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia.\nLARSEN, J., files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which PAPADAKOS, J., joins.\nZAPPALA, J., files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\n. As a result of Mrs. Okkerse\u2019s accident she became incompetent, and eventually died.\n. Rule 1006 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure provides in pertinent part:\n(a) ... an action against an individual may be brought in and only in a county in which he may be served or in which the cause of action arose or where a transaction or occurrence took place out of\nwhich the cause of action arose or in any other county authorized by law.\n(b) Actions against the following defendants, except as otherwise provided in Subdivision (c), may be brought in and only in the counties designated by the following rules: political subdivisions, Rule 2103; partnerships, Rule 2130; unincorporated associations, Rule 2156; corporations and similar entities. Rule 2179.\n(c) An action to enforce a joint or joint and several liability against two or more defendants except actions in which the Commonwealth is a party defendant, may be brought against all defendants in any county in which the venue may be laid against any one of the defendants under the general rules of Subdivisions (a) or (b).\n(d) (1) For the convenience of parties and witnesses the court upon petition of any party may transfer an action to the appropriate court of any other county where the action could originally have been brought.\n(2) Where, upon petition and hearing thereon, the court finds that a fair and impartial trial cannot be held in the county for reasons stated of record the court may order that the action be transferred. The order changing venue shall be certified forthwith to the Supreme Court, which shall designate the country to which the case is to be transferred.\n(3) It shall be the duty of the prothonotary of the court in which the action is pending to forward to the prothonotary of the county to which the action is transferred certified copies of the docket entries, filed in the action. The costs and fees of the petition for transfer and the removal of the record shall be paid by the petitioner in the first instance to be taxable as costs in the case.\n(e) Improper venue shall be raised by preliminary objection and if not so raised shall be waived. If a preliminary objection to venue is sustained and there is a county of proper venue within the State the action shall not be dismissed but shall be transferred to the appropriate court of that county. The costs and fees for transfer and removal of the record shall be paid by the plaintiff.\n(f) If the plaintiff states more than one cause of action against the same defendant in the complaint pursuant to Rule \u2022 1020(a), the action may be brought in any county in which any one of the individual causes of action might have been brought.\n. Said \"petition\u201d was not filed under a separate cover, but was included in the filing labeled \"preliminary objections\u201d. The Superior Court correctly held that this was an improper way in which to raise the forum non conveniens issue. See Hosiery Corp. of America v. Rich, 327 Pa.Super. 472, 476 A.2d 50 (1984). However, the Superior Court did not dispose of the matter on this procedural irregularity.\n. Judge White\u2019s order transferring the action from Philadelphia to Montgomery Court was docketed October 7, 1985, and on October 9, 1985, a praecipe to transfer the action to Montgomery County was filed. Okkerses then filed a timely appeal from this decision.\n. Upon receiving the Pfaumers\u2019 request for reconsideration Judge DiBona vacated his order of October 7, 1985. This order was then reinstated by the order of November 4, 1985, at which time the appeal period began to run.\n. Significantly, the Denison petition did not seek a severance.\n. No. 89 E.D. Appeal Dkt., 1988.\n. See Pa.R.Civ.P. 1006 and this Court has emphatically stated that the choice of forum by a plaintiff is entitled to weighty consideration. Walker v. Ohio River Co., 416 Pa. 149, 152, 205 A.2d 43, 45 (1964).\n. According to plaintiffs\u2019 brief in this appeal, and their response to Ms. Denison\u2019s request for a change of venue, plaintiffs would have asserted, inter alia, that the Philadelphia forum was chosen because defendants Ford and PennDot maintained voluminous records in Philadelphia which may be required to be produced at trial, and that the eyewitnesses to the accident were from out of state and presumably Philadelphia was a more accessible forum for them. Plaintiffs also contend: that the Philadelphia courthouse is the same distance from the accident site as is the Montgomery County courthouse; that the respective courthouses are only sixteen miles apart; that counsel for most of the defendants have their offices in Philadelphia; and that compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses is equally available in both counties.\n.
