{"id": "554385", "contents": "Opinion,\nMr. Justice Sterrett :\nIt cannot be doubted that the authority of the burgess and town council of the borough of Port Allegany, to levy and collect the tax in question, depends on the validity of the election purporting to have been held under and by virtue of the act of April 16,1875, entitled \u201c An act authorizing the burgess and town council of each of the several boroughs throughout this commonwealth to levy and collect a gas, kerosene oil and water tax,\u201d and the supplement thereto approved May 1, 1876.\nAfter providing for a special election to determine by a vote of the qualified electors of any borough whether the power to levy and collect such tax shall be exercised by the borough authorities or not, the act declares it shall be done \u201c by voting written or printed tickets having on the outside the words \u2018 gas and water tax,\u2019 and on the inside, \u2018 for a gas and water tax,\u2019 or, \u2018 against a gas and water tax \u2019; and the majority of the legal votes so cast for or against a gas and water tax shall decide for or against the application of the said act to the said borough.\u201d The bill charges and the answer admits that none of the tickets voted at the election in question were in the form prescribed by the act; but, on the contrary, all the tickets then voted had written or printed on the outside thereof the words \u201c Water Tax \u201d only, and on the inside the words \u201cFor a Water Tax,\u201d or \u201c Against a Water Tax.\u201d Such a vote as this was clearly unauthorized by the original act, and hence the so-called election was void and of no effect, unless the act was amended by the supplement of 1876 which purports to enact that the second section of the act of 1875 be amended by adding thereto as follows: \u201c That the legal voters of said borough may vote written or printed tickets, having on the outside the words \u2018 gas tax,\u2019 \u2018water tax \u2019 or \u2018 kerosene oil tax,\u2019 and on the inside \u2018 for a gas tax,\u2019 \u2018 for a water tax,\u2019 \u2018for a kerosene oil tax,\u2019 or \u2018against a gas tax,\u2019 \u2018against a water tax,\u2019 or \u2018 against a kerosene oil tax.\u2019 \u201d If the supplement is valid, it so modifies the provisions of the original act as t\u00a9 authorize a vote in the precise form in which it was taken; but, unfortunately for the appellees, it is in direct conflict with \u00a7 6, Article III. of the Constitution which ordains that, \u201c No law shall be revived, amended or the provisions thereof extended or conferred, by reference to its title only, but so much thereof as is revived, amended, extended or conferred shall be re-enacted and published at length.\u201d\nThe supplement was manifestly intended to be amendatory of the original act, and nothing else ; but, inasmuch as it utterly ignores the constitutional requirement, above quoted, it is unconstitutional and void. It therefore follows that the vote as taken was unauthorized and the borough authorities, upon their own showing, had no power to levy and collect the tax complained of, and the prayer of appellants for a preliminary injunction should have been granted.\nDecree reversed at the costs of appellants, and record remitted with instructions to proceed according to equity practice."}
