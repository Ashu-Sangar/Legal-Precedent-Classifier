The court below opened the judgment, saying: \u201cThe depositions leave it a matter of great uncertainty as to whether or not there was any consideration moving to defendant for the judgment note filed of record in this case; we are of opinion, therefore, the rule to open should be made absolute and the matter referred to a jury for determination.\u201d The lien of the execution not having been released, defendant petitioned for a rule to obtain that relief, and the court made this order: \u201cRule absolute; defendant has leave to enter security in sum of $3,000 to secure judgment, interest and costs, including sheriff\u2019s costs.\u201d We construe this to mean that the lien is released on the entry of approved security as above stated, and not before.\nThe order appealed from is accordingly affirmed."}
