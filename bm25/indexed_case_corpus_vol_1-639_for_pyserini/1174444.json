{"id": "1174444", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Maxey,\nPlaintiff brought suit in assumpsit against the defendant alleging a breach of an agreement to enter into a lease of an apartment in a house owned by plaintiff. It was averred in the statement that defendant offered to lease from the plaintiff this apartment for a term of twenty-one months from January 10, 1936, at a total rental of $3,465, and that defendant executed and delivered to plaintiff a written application to lease, a copy of which was appended to the statement of claim, and that on the following day the defendant orally accepted plaintiff\u2019s offer as contained in that application and that plaintiff and defendant arranged to execute a written lease on November 28, 1935, but the defendant later refused to sign the lease. Defendant filed an affidavit of defense raising the following questions of law: (1) That \u201cthe application [of defendant] is not an offer\u201d but merely an invitation to negotiate; (2) That the measure of damages (the rent which defendant agreed to pay) is erroneous. The affidavit of defense was sustained on the first ground and judgment entered in favor of defendant. After re-argument, the first decision was adhered to. Plaintiff appealed.\nThe basis of this suit is a paper bearing the caption, \u201cApplication For Lease.\u201d A certain apartment is designated as \u201cD 203-204 Floor.\u201d The paper then contains data as to the applicant. It contains also the following: \u201cLease Rental $3465.00\u201d\n\u201cTerm of Lease 21 month From 1-15-36 to 10-15-37.\u201d Under the reading of \u201cRemarks\u201d appears the following: \u201cApt. to be redecorated throughout to tenants selection. Selection. of colors will be made after lease is signed.\u201d\nThe court below said: \u201cThe paper signed by defendant was unilateral in its terms. It was not an agreement signed by both parties but was just what it purports to be, \u2018An Application\u2019 contemplating something to be done by both parties in the future. This is evident from the notation on the Application \u2014 \u2018Selections of colors will be made after lease is signed.\u2019 There is nothing in the application to justify a conclusion that there was a union of the minds of the parties as to the terms o'f the lease. There is no averment that a deposit was made by the defendant. Even if there was a deposit, ithe plaintiff \u2018reserves to itself the right to return such deposit accompanying the application. The return of the said deposit shall constitute a valid and sufficient refusal to lease to the applicant, and the applicant herewith expressly agrees to this stipulation.\u2019 \u201d\nThat an offer is distinguished from preliminary negotiations is a fact well recognized in the law of contracts. Williston on Contracts (revised edition), Yol. 1, section 27, makes this statement: \u201cFrequently negotiations for a contract are begun between parties by general expressions of willingness to enter into a bargain upon stated terms and yet the natural construction of the words and conduct of the parties is rather that they are inviting offers, or suggesting the terms of a possible future bargain, than making positive offers. . . . Language that at first sight may seem an offer may be found merely preliminary in its character.\u201d Section 25 of the Restatement of the Law of Contracts reads as follows: \u201cIf from a promise, or manifestation of intention, or from the circumstances existing at the time, the person to whom the promise or manifestation is addressed knows or has reason to know that the person making it does not intend it as an expression of his fixed purpose until he has given a further expression of assent, he has not made an offer.\u201d Section 26: \u201cMutual manifestations of assent that are in themselves sufficient to make a contract will not be prevented from so operating by the mere fact that the parties also manifest an intention to prepare and adopt a written memorial thereof; but other facts may show that the manifestations are merely preliminary expressions as stated in section 25.\u201d In \u201cComment\u201d under section 26 appears the following : \u201ca. ... if the preliminary agreement is incomplete, it being apparent that the determination of certain details is deferred until the writing is made out; or if an intention is manifested in any way that legal obligations between the parties shall be deferred until the writing is made, the preliminary negotiations and agreements do not constitute a contract.\u201d\nIn the instant case it is clear that the \u201cpreliminary agreement\u201d labeled an \u201cApplication For Lease\u201d was incomplete. The rental item alone discloses that. Whether the sum of $3,465 as rental was to be paid in advance or at the end of the term or in quarterly or monthly installments, and if in installments whether these were to be in advance or otherwise, does not appear. The matter of decoration and selection of colors was also incompletely referred to. The word \u201credecorate\u201d has a wide variety of meanings. Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary defines \u201cdecorate\u201d as \u201cto increase in beauty by the addition of something becoming or beautiful.\u201d When the application specified: \u201cApartment to be redecorated throughout to tenant\u2019s selection,\u201d it left the character and extent of the decoration undefined and it cannot be determined to a certainty from the language used whether the decoration was to be paid for by the landlord or by the tenant. The sentence might mean: I, the proposed tenant, will redecorate the apartment to suit myself and I will pay for such decoration; or it might mean: I will order the apartment decorated according to my own ideas of good taste and expense and the landlord will pay for it. The other phrase used, to wit: \u201cSelection of colors will be made after lease is signed,\u201d clearly indicates that a lease was to be signed which would be specific in all its terms as to the character and extent of the proposed redecoration except the mere detail of selection of colors.\nThis court has recognized a distinction between \u201cproposed understandings\u201d and a \u201cconcluded agreement.\u201d In Vitro Mfg. Co. v. Standard Chemical Co., 291 Pa. 85, 139 A. 615, we said: \u201cIt is evident from this correspondence that the parties were negotiating to buy and sell, and that each set of letters refers only to proposed understandings which were to be concluded in the future ; whereas, if a right of recovery is to be shown, the terms of a concluded agreement must appear.\u201d In the case at bar all the important terms of a concluded agreement do not appear.\nThe \u201cApplication For Lease\u201d contained more data about the applicant than it did about the proposed lease. It gave his business and residential addresses and telephone numbers, the size of his family, the name of his landlord, how long he had lived at his address, and business and social references. It, in effect, said to plaintiff: \u201cI am now in the market for an apartment such as your Apartment D 203-204, look me up and if you conclude that I would make a suitable tenant for this apartment at a gross rental of $3,465, for twenty-one months, I am willing on that as a basis to negotiate with you as to the other terms of the lease.\u201d Practically all the terms customarily found in leases, except the tenure and rental, were omitted from the application. As already noted, nothing was stipulated as to how and when the rent should be paid. Nothing was said as to how long a period of grace for nonpayment of rent would be allowed, or as to whether the landlord expected the proposed tenant to agree to confess judgment for the rent payable for the entire term in case of default and to waive exemptions in that confession of judgment, or as to how the landlord should acquire possession of the premises in case of default, or as to whether the lease would be automatically renewed at the end of the term. No reference was made to light, heat and water, or to the respective rights and obligations of the parties should the apartment be destroyed or damaged by fire. It is not unusual for persons to agree to negotiate with the view of entering into contractual relations and to reach an accord at once as to certain major items of the proposed contract and then later find that on other details they cannot agree. In such a case no contract results.\nIn Elkhorn-Hazard Coal Co. v. Kentucky River Coal Corp., 20 Fed. (2d) 67, the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit held that when the defendant wrote the plaintiff as follows: \u201cI would be willing to make a lease to your company of this land [describing it] at a royalty of ten cents per ton and a minimum say on what you might mine the first six months after signing this lease; the first year following $1,000; and the second year following and each year thereafter $2,000, the Elk-horn-Hazard Coal Company paying all county, state and school taxes on same. If this meets with your approval, our general counsel will draw up a lease for your signatures according to the above terms,\u201d and when plaintiff replied: \u201cIt accepts offer as proposed in the letter aforesaid, and requests that your company draw up its customary lease as your company makes to other persons under similar circumstances,\u201d a contract did not result. The court said: \u201cThe letter is not in form an offer. It merely says that the writer \u2018would be willing to make a lease.\u2019 Its last paragraph calls for a communication to the writer of an approval, and repels the idea that a contract would result by merely mailing an acceptance.\u201d The court further said: \u201cThe letter calls for a previous expression of approval, without which no lease is to be prepared and executed. The subject-matter is of a nature to require a formal writing for its full expression. It is of that class which is usually put in writing. The letter treats of only a few of the terms of the usual lease.\u201d\nIn Lyman v. Robinson, 14 Allen (Mass.) 242, 254, it was aptly said: \u201cCare should always be taken not to construe as an agreement letters which the parties intended only as a preliminary negotiation.\u201d gee Moulton v. Kershaw et al., (Wis.), 18 N. W. 172.\nIn the case of Way v. Fraser, 230 Pa. 49, 79 A. 154, which was an action for a breach of contract to make a lease, defendant\u2019s partner, Loveless, had a conversation with the plaintiff about leasing certain property. This was followed by a letter reading as follows: \u201cI did not get the opportunity yesterday to call you up after I had talked with my partner. We do not feel that we care to obligate ourselves for a longer lease than three years or five at the rent offered, viz., $4,000. If this offer interests you let me know sometime soon, as we want to get the matter off our hands. We have two or three locations under consideration, but I prefer your place myself.\u201d The property referred to was the plaintiff\u2019s warehouse at No. 439 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh. After the receipt of this letter, the parties had a second conversation and the plaintiff agreed to lease the warehouse to the defendant and his partner, from April 1, 1905, at an annual rental of $4,000. Plaintiff then prepared and mailed to defendant\u2019s partner a lease for the premises, accompanied by a letter reading as follows: \u201cI have received your letter of the 30th inst. regarding lease of building at No. 439 Liberty Street, and confirming my conversation with you this morning. I beg to hereby accept your proposition, and inclose leases of the building to you and Mr. Fraser for three years at the rate of $4,000, the amount suggested in your letter. Kindly have one of these leases signed by yourself and Mr. Fraser and the signatures duly witnessed and return the same to me as soon as possible. . . .\u201d The leases prepared were returned by defendant unexecuted, with a letter stating that defendant and his partner were \u201cnot open for a lease at this time.\u201d Judgment was entered on the demurrer, and affirmed by this court in an opinion by Mr. Justice Elkin, who said: \u201cWe agree with the learned court below that the Loveless letter was only an expression of his willingness to negotiate for a lease and was not a definite offer containing the terms and conditions upon which he would lease the property. The most casual reading of the letter shows that further negotiations were intended and no final conclusion had been reached.\u201d\nWilliston on Contracts (revised edition), Yol. 1, section 28, states: \u201c. . . frequently where the parties contemplate a future written contract, it is obvious from their language or from the surrounding circumstances, that other matters, as to which no definite agreement has yet been reached, are expected to be provided for in the writing. In such a case the oral agreement may be objectionable for indefiniteness, and in any event a positive intention is apparent that the bargain shall be ineffectual until some further acts.\u201d Section 37: \"... A lack of definiteness in an agreement may concern the time of performance, the price to be paid, work to be done, property to be transferred, or miscellaneous stipulations in the agreement.\u201d\nIn the instant case the conclusion is inescapable that the \u201cApplication For Lease\u201d was a mere offer by the applicant of himself as a possible tenant of the premises defined, for a term of twenty-one months at an aggregate rental of $3,465, with the understanding that if applicant was personally acceptable to the landlord, he and the latter\u2019s representative would meet and execute a lease provided they could both agree on all the necessary stipulations, in addition to the two stipulations (term and aggregate rental) as to which there was preliminary accord. The landlord\u2019s mere personal acceptance of the applicant did not fulfill all the conditions of the proviso and therefore no contractual relations resulted.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nMr. Justice Drew and Mr. Justice Stern dissent."}
