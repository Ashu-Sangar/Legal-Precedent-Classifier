{"id": "1279707", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThe order discharging the rule granted on the defendants\u2019 petition for the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint is affirmed on the following excerpts from the opinion of Judge Waters for the court below.\n\u201cThe plaintiff commenced this trespass action against the defendant union and its business agent to recover damages for an alleged improper interference with her employment. The complaint set forth that she was employed as a sample blouse machine operator by Charles Cardonick in August, 1950 for \u2018permanent employment all year around\u2019 at a net weekly salary of |60.95; that such employment contract was known to defendants and that defendants wrongfully and maliciously threatened to call a strike unless plaintiff was discharged from employment. Plaintiff averred that by reason of these threats she was discharged from her employment on Easter Monday of 1951; that, thereafter, whenever she sought employment in other blouse shops, defendants prevented her from obtaining such employment by threats of strike or other methods of retaliation against her prospective employers. Plaintiff averred that the defendant union did not have a union security agreement with her employer, Cardonick. Plaintiff seeks damages and punitive damages for the defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct in inducing her discharge and for causing termination of her employment contract.\n\u201cThe defendants filed a responsive answer to the complaint joining factual issue by way of denial of the averments therein. The defendants in their petition seeking dismissal of the complaint alleged that the employers referred to in the complaint are all engaged in the manufacturing business and buy and sell commodities and are engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of The Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, Title 29, U.S.C.A.; that the actions of which plaintiff complains are unfair labor practices within the meaning of Sections 8(b) (1) and 8(b) (2) of said act; that the plaintiff filed unfair labor practice charges against her employer in March, 1952, with the National Labor Relations Board and that said charges were based on the facts alleged in the complaint; that the Board accepted jurisdiction and dismissed the charges for want of evidence. The defendants aver that \u2018the National Labor Relations Board under said Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 has exclusive jurisdiction to hear, act upon, and determine the disposition of unfair labor practice charges involving employers and unions engaged in Inter-State Commerce and provides for a remedy ... of reinstatement and back pay;\u2019 that the court is without jurisdiction over the subject matt\u00e9r of these proceedings. \u25a0\n\u201cThe plaintiff in her answer to the defendants\u2019 petition denied that defendant union had a security contract with her employer or prospective employers and averred that the Labor Management Relations Act applied only where union contracts containing such security clauses are in effect. The plaintiff admitted filing charges as alleged but averred that she was not accorded a hearing before the Board or given an opportunity to present evidence and testimony; that the Board\u2019s decision was made on the basis of an investigation conducted by a Board representative without giving plaintiff an opportunity to cross-examine the persons interviewed whose statements were not made under oath or before any tribunal. No depositions were taken and the factual averments set forth in the answer to the petition must be taken as true.\n\u201cThe right to engage in remunerative employment is a valuable right and an improper interference with it is answerable in a common law action in trespass. In Mische v. Kaminski, 127 Pa. Superior Ct. 66 (1937) it was held that the right to work is entitled to protection in equity; that the defendants in that case did not have the right to interfere with plaintiffs\u2019 existing employment or to combine to prevent plaintiffs from obtaining other employment. The right of an individual to work for whom he pleases and at the wages he pleases was recognized and affirmed in Jefferson and Indiana Coal Co. v. Marks, 287 Pa. 171-5 (1926). The defense to interference with the right to work rests upon justification or privilege, but no such defense has been pleaded or proved.\n\u201cIn this case the facts do not establish any privilege of action in the defendants. It does not appear that the defendant union had any relationship, contractual or otherwise, with the plaintiff\u2019s employers at the time defendants induced her discharge. It does not even appear that the defendant union represented all or any of the employees of the plaintiff\u2019s employer or prospective employers.\n\u201cThe reasons or purpose for interference with plaintiff\u2019s employment do not appear. The defendants have not pleaded or proved a legitimate labor purpose or dispute; there is no evidence as to organizational effort or maintenance of union security. The plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges a wrongful and malicious interference, and the defendants in their answer to the complaint denied such interference and denied that they caused her discharge.\n\u201cThe defendants, in their petition for dismissal, refer to the proceedings before the National Labor Relations Board but it is clear that they have not properly pleaded such proceeding by way of res adjudicata, even assuming that such proceeding could constitute such defense. The premature character of defendants\u2019 petition to dismiss is illustrated by defendants\u2019 reference to the papers filed by plaintiff with the National Labor Relations Board. A careful consideration of the parties\u2019 stipulation shows that the parties agreed that the defendants\u2019 exhibits were true and correct copies of the original charges filed. However, whether the plaintiff would, in any event, be bound by such statements is a matter for trial and evidence.\n\u201cIn the circumstances, we do not think that we are called upon to reflect our views upon the question of whether and to what extent, if any, the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, as amended, has conferred an exclusive jurisdiction in the National Labor Relations Board to determine the disposition of unfair labor practice charges. We do not have before us any unfair labor practice charges but rather an individual action in trespass for damages. This court has jurisdiction over the persons of the parties and the court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of a common-law trespass action.\n\u201cA review of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 and its amendments does not show any congressional intent to reduce the rights of the individual laborer in securing satisfaction in a common law action for tortious conduct. The defendants have cited from Garner v. Teamsters, Chauffeurs and Helpers, Local Union No. 776, 346 U.S. 485, 74 S. Ct. 161 (1953) [the same case 373 Pa. 19 (1953)] at great length. The facts and scope of the instant case are quite distinct from the questions there presented. It has been held that unions may be held accountable in state courts for damages resulting from their tortious conduct: see United Construction Workers v. Laburnum Construction Corp., 347 U.S. 656 (1954); Bens v. Hidalgo, 233 F. 2d 63 (1956).\n\u201cSection 8(b) of the Labor Management Eelations Act of 1947, as amended, provides: \u2018It shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents . . . (2) to cause or attempt to cause an employer to discriminate against an employee in violation of subsection (a) (3) of this section or to discriminate against an employee with respect to whom membership in such organization has been denied or terminated on some ground other than his failure to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees uniformly required as a condition of acquiring or retaining membership.\u2019\n\u201cSubsection (a) (3) provides: \u2018It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer ... (3) by discrimination in regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization: . . .\u2019.\n\u201cAs indicated earlier, we cannot properly ascertain from the record before us what caused or motivated the parties\u2019 actions. The pleadings before us contained nothing as to discrimination against an employee with respect to membership in a union or discrimination in regard to tenure to encourage or discourage membership in a union. We simply do not have the facts.\u201d\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents."}
