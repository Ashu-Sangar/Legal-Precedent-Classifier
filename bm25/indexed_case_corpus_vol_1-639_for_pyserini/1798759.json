{"id": "1798759", "contents": "opinion of the court\nPAPADAKOS, Justice.\nThis is an appeal by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (Appellant) from the March 15, 1985, Order of the Superior Court reversing the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County and discharging Barry Charles Gordon (Appellee).\nOn July 15, 1982, Appellee, a licensed pharmacist, sold a prescription drug to Mr. Cawley, a criminal informant, without a prescription. The drug sold by Appellee was Dilaudid, a Schedule II opiate derivative drug. The sale took place at a motel in Springfield Township, Delaware County. The arrangement was that Mr. Cawley was to purchase two bottles, each containing one hundred pills, at a price of eight hundred ($800.00) dollars per bottle. Additionally, Mr. Cawley was to procure both a prostitute and a motel room for Appellee\u2019s use. Mr. Cawley signed a consent form manifesting his willingness to have his conversation with Appellee intercepted and recorded, and he was wearing a \u201cbody wire,\u201d an electrical surveillance device, while consummating the transaction with Appellee.\nWhen Appellee brought two bottles of Dilaudid with him, Mr. Cawley explained that he could \u201cscrounge up\u201d only eight hundred ($800.00) dollars, and was, therefore, only able to purchase one bottle of pills. Appellee agreed to the sale of a single bottle at that time, and a subsequent sale the next day, when Mr. Cawley would be able to acquire an additional eight hundred ($800.00) dollars for that purchase. Mr. Cawley neither possessed a prescription for Dilaudid, nor did Appellee request Mr. Cawley to provide him with one. Upon a transfer of possession of the pills from Appellee to Mr. Cawley, Appellee was immediately arrested and charged with violating subdivisions 13(a)(16) and 13(a)(30) of the Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act (CSDDCA).\nOn November 12, 1982, Appellee waived his right to a jury trial and a non-jury trial commenced before the Honorable Charles C. Keeler of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County. The uncontroverted evidence at trial showed that Appellee was a pharmacist licensed by the State Board of Pharmacy. At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, Appellee demurred to the evidence and, at the conclusion of his own case, moved for a directed verdict of acquittal, contending that as a licensed pharmacist, he could not be found guilty of violating the sections with which the Commonwealth had charged him. Appellee maintained that subdivisions 13(a)(16) and (30) of the CSDDCA, by their very terms, did not apply to practitioners, which included licensed pharmacists. The trial court denied both motions and, on November 15, 1982, found Appellee guilty of the offenses charged. Post-verdict motions were denied and Appellee was sentenced on May 23, 1983, to pay costs and fines in the amount of two thousand five hundred ($2,500.00) dollars, and to undergo imprisonment in the Delaware County Prison for a minimum of eleven (11) months to a maximum of twenty-three (23) months, less one day.\nAppellee filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court, which held that he could not be convicted under Sections 13(a)(16) and (30) because those sections specifically exempt licensed pharmacists. Superior Court, therefore, reversed Appellee\u2019s conviction and discharged him. We then granted the Commonwealth\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal to determine the interesting question of whether a pharmacist licensed to distribute drugs in the course of his professional conduct, who sells drugs outside the course of his profession in exchange for money and the use of a prostitute, is exempt from prosecution under 35 Pa.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(16) and (30) of the CSDDCA. Appellee maintains, and, indeed, the Superior Court held, that his status as a licensed pharmacist precludes prosecution under these sections of the Act, and that once one obtains a license as a physician, pharmacist, etc., he attains the status of \u201cpractitioner\u201d and can be prosecuted, if at all, only under 35 Pa.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(14), when he engages in illegal deliveries of drugs, regardless of the place, method, nature or circumstances of the delivery.\nThe Commonwealth, on the other hand, maintains that these three sections are not \u201cstatus\u201d controlled, but, rather, pertain to the manner, nature and guise of the delivery or transaction. Under the Act, the definition of practitioner is provided by 35 Pa.S. \u00a7 780-102(b):\nPractitioner means: (i) a physician, osteopath, dentist, veterinarian, pharmacist, podiatrist, nurse, scientific investigator, or other person licensed, registered or otherwise permitted to distribute, dispense, conduct research with respect to or to administer a controlled substance, other drug or device IN THE COURSE OF PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE or research in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; (ii) a pharmacy, hospital, clinic or other institution licensed, registered, or otherwise permitted to distribute, dispense, conduct research with respect to or to administer a controlled substance, other drug or device in the course of professional practice or research in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. (Emphasis added.)\nWhile conceding that \u201cpractitioner\u201d includes a licensed pharmacist distributing drugs in the course of his professional practice, the Commonwealth contends that the delivery made in the instant case was not a delivery made in the course of the Appellee\u2019s professional practice, because he was not acting, nor did he purport to be acting, under the guise of his profession. Hence, the Commonwealth concludes that Appellee was not acting as a \u201cpractitioner\u201d at the time in question, and the Commonwealth reasons that he was not exempt from prosecution under \u00a7 780-113(a)(16) and (30).\nWe find the Commonwealth\u2019s reasoning persuasive. There is no factual dispute in this case \u2014 the question is purely one of statutory construction. Appellee claims exemption from prosecution under \u00a7\u00a7 780-113(a)(16) and (30) by virtue of his status as a \u201cpractitioner,\u201d yet, at no time has he claimed that he was acting in the course of his professional practice. Nor would this record support such a claim. The learned trial judge, in his analysis of \u00a7 780-102(b), correctly noted that \u201cto fall within the definition of practitioner, either individually as a pharmacist, or as a representative of a business entity such as a pharmacy, the party claiming the exemption must act within \u2018the course of professional practice\u2019.\u201d 35 Pa.S. \u00a7\u00a7 780-113(a)(16) and (30) provide exemption for \u201cpersons registered under the Act\u201d or \u201cpractitioners licensed by the appropriate State board.\u201d 35 Pa.S. \u00a7 780-106(a), entitled \u201cRegistration,\u201d provides:\nNo person shall operate within this Commonwealth as a manufacturer, distributor or retailer of controlled substances, other drugs and devices nor sell, offer for sale nor solicit the purchase of controlled substances, other drugs and devices nor hold them for sale or resale until such person has registered under this act with the secretary. ...\n(3) ... Nothing contained herein shall be construed to require the registration hereunder of any practitioner registered or licensed by the appropriate State board----\nThe definitional section of the Act defines registrant as \u201cany one person registered under the laws of this Commonwealth to manufacture, dispense, distribute, administer or sell drugs.\u201d 35 Pa.S. \u00a7 780-102. Thus, one who is otherwise registered or licensed by the Commonwealth or any of its various agencies or boards need not specifically register under the Act itself.\nAppellee has presented no evidence of a separate registration entitling him to the exemption afforded \u201cpersons registered under the Act.\u201d Under the facts of this case, we cannot accept his assertion that his status as a licensed pharmacist qualifies him for the \u201cpractitioner\u201d exemption without regard to the nature of the transaction involved. Our analysis of the entire Act compels the conclusion that the Legislature did not intend that an individual could, by obtaining a license as a pharmacist, then engage in conduct far from the trappings of the pharmacy and its business, which amounts to no more than an illicit, clandestine, street transaction, and then use the license as a shield to avoid prosecution for such conduct. In ascertaining legislative intent for purposes of construing a statute, the practical results of a particular interpretation may be considered. See, Lehigh Valley Co-Op Farmers v. Com., Bureau of Employment Sec. Dept. of Labor and Industry, 498 Pa. 521, 447 A.2d 948 (1982); 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(6). Appellee asserts our decision in Commonwealth v. Hill, 481 Pa. 37, 391 A.2d 1303 (1978), for the proposition that a basic tenet of statutory construction is that penal statutes must be strictly construed. However, strict construction does not require that the words of a criminal statute be given their narrowest meaning or that the Legislature\u2019s evident intent be disregarded. Commonwealth v. Duncan, 456 Pa. 495, 321 A.2d 917 (1974). This is not a case where we are construing ambiguities, rather, we are merely interpreting the plain language of the Act in light of the definitions provided. Status as a licensee is only the beginning of the analysis of whether a person is a practitioner; it is not the end. It still remains to be determined whether the licensed party is acting in the course of his professional practice.\nAppellee asserts that the Legislature has established a parallel system for regulating the possession and sale of controlled substances, and maintains that the system applies one set of restrictions and standards to practitioners, and another set to non-prctitioners, and that the distinction rests solely on one\u2019s status. Our reading of the Act convinces us that the separate systems are distinguished according to the nature of the transaction and the status of the individual involved. We cannot presume that the Legislature intended an absurd or unreasonable result. Zimmerman v. O\u2019Bannon, 497 Pa. 551, 442 A.2d 674 (1982). Thus, certain activities may be proscribed by more than one section of the Act. When a licensed pharmacist acts like a street pusher, he is not a \u201cpractitioner\u201d and can be prosecuted under \u00a7\u00a7 780-113(a)(16) and (30).\nWe also reject the Superior Court\u2019s determination that unauthorized transactions, such as in this case, should be prosecuted under 35 Pa.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(14). That section is designed to prohibit the abuse of the practitioner\u2019s privilege to distribute drugs under the cloak of his privilege. Appellee did not employ the cloak of his privilege in this transaction; his actions were the blatant transgressions of a common street pusher and the Commonwealth is entitled to prosecute him as such.\nAccordingly, we reverse the Order of Superior Court which reversed Appellee\u2019s conviction. This case is remanded to Superior Court to consider the issues not disposed of in their prior review.\nHUTCHINSON, J., concurs in the result.\nZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion in which NIX, C.J., joins.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to Section 2 of the Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 724(a), as amended October 5, 1980, which provides:\n\u00a7 724. Allowance of appeals from Superior and Commonwealth Courts.\n(a) General rule. \u2014 Except as provided by section 9781(f) (relating to limitation on additional appellate review), final orders of the Superior Court and final orders of the Commonwealth Court not appealable under section 723 (relating to appeals from Commonwealth Court) may be reviewed by the Supreme Court upon allowance of appeal by any two justices of the Supreme Court upon petition of any party to the matter. If the petition shall be granted, the Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction to review the order in the manner provided by section 5105(d)(1) (relating to scope of appeal).\n. Act of Apr\u00fc 14, 1972, P.L. 233, No. 64 (as amended), 35 Pa.S. \u00a7 780-113(a) which provides:\n35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a): The following acts and the causing thereof within the Commonwealth are hereby prohibited:\n(16) knowingly or intentionally possessing a controlled or counterfeit substance by a person not registered under this act, or a practitioner not registered or licensed by the appropriate State board, unless the substance was obtained directly from, or pursuant to, a valid prescription order or order of a practitioner, or except as otherwise authorized by this act. (Emphasis added.)\n(30) Except as authorized by this act, the manufacture, delivery, or possession with intent to manufacture or deliver, a controlled substance by a person not registered under this act, or a practitioner not registered or licensed by the appropriate State board, or knowingly creating, delivering or possessing with intent to deliver, a counterfeit controlled substance. (Emphasis added.)\n. 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a): The following acts and the causing thereof within the Commonwealth are hereby prohibited:\n(14) The administration, dispensing, delivery, gift or prescription of any controlled substance by any practitioner or professional assistant under the practitioner\u2019s direction and supervision unless done (i) in good faith in the course of his professional practice; (ii) within the scope of the patient relationship; (iii) in accordance with treatment principles accepted by a responsible segment of the medical profession.
