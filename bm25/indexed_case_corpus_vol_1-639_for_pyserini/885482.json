He was therefore right in directing them to find in favor of the plaintiff, and in charging them in the language of plaintiff\u2019s fourth point, that \u201c the note is the final contract of the parties in writing, and there being no competent evidence to go to the jury to impeach the note, the verdict should be for the plaintiff for the amount of the note and interest.\u201d It follows that there was no error in refusing to affirm defendants\u2019 points recited in the third to ninth specifications inclusive. There is nothing in the record that requires further notice. The assignments of error are all dismissed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
