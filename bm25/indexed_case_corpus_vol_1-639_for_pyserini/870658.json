{"id": "870658", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrbett,\nAll that can be profitably said, in relation to the facts as well as the questions of law involved in this case, will be found in the able and exhaustive opinion of the learned president of the court below. We are fully satisfied as to the correctness of the conclusions, both of law and fact, so far, at least, as they are involved in the decree. We therefore affirm the decree on his opinion and dismiss the appeal at appellant\u2019s costs."}
