{"id": "482806", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant Geoffrey Morgan was tried by a jury and convicted upon an indictment charging that he \u201cdid defile and cast contempt on the American flag by publicly wearing a 6\" by 8\" American flag sewn on the seat of his pants . . . . \u201d After denial of appellant\u2019s post-trial motions, he appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed per curiam. 222 Pa.Super. 511, 295 A.2d 183 (1972). We permitted an appeal to this Court. We reverse.\nThe statute under which Morgan was convicted punishes one who \u201cpublicly or privately mutilates, defaces, defiles or tramples upon, or casts contempt either by words or act upon\u201d the American flag. Appellant contends that the statute is impermissibly vague. With respect to the prohibition of \u201ccast[ing] contempt,\u201d we agree.\nThe general principles of the void-for-vagueness doctrine are well-settled and need no extensive discussion here. See generally Grayned v. Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-109, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2298-2299, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972), and cases cited therein; Note, The Void-For-Vagueness Doctrine in the Supreme Court, 109 U.Pa.L. Rev. 67 (1960). The precise question before us has recently been decided by the Supreme Court of the United States in Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974). There the defendant had been convicted under a Massachusetts statute of \u201cpublicly . treat [ing] contemptuously the flag of the United States\u201d by wearing it sewn to the seat of his pants. The Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Powell, held the statute unconstitutional, stating:\n\u201cFlag wearing in a day of relaxed clothing styles may be simply for adornment or a ploy to attract attention. It and many other current, careless uses of the flag nevertheless constitute unceremonial treatment that many people may view as contemptuous. Yet in a time of widely varying attitudes and tastes for displaying something as ubiquitous as the United States flag or representations of it, it could hardly be the purpose of the Massachusetts legislature to make criminal every informal use of the flag. The statutory language under which Goguen was charged, however, fails to drawn reasonably clear lines between the kinds of nonceremonial treatment that are criminal and those that are not. Due process requires that all \u2018be informed as to what the State commands or forbids .,\u2019 Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453 [59 S.Ct. 618, 619, 83 L.Ed. 888] (1939), and that \u2018men of common intelligence\u2019 not be forced to guess at the meaning of the criminal law. Connally v. General Construction Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 [46 S.Ct. 126, 127, 70 L.Ed. 322] (1932). Given today\u2019s tendencies to treat the flag unceremoniously, those notice standards are not satisfied here.\n\u201cThe language at issue [\u2018treats contemptuously\u2019] is void for vagueness as applied to Goguen because it subjected him to criminal liability under a standard so indefinite that police, court, and jury were free to react to nothing more than their own preferences for treatment of the flag.\n\u201c[B]ecause display of the flag is so common and takes so many forms, changing from one generation to another and often difficult to distinguish in principle, a legislature should define with some care the flag behavior it intends to outlaw. Certainly nothing prevents a legislature from defining with substantial specificity what constitutes forbidden treatment of United States flags. The statutory language at issue here [\u2018treats contemptuously\u2019] fails to approach that goal and is void for vagueness.\u201d\n415 U.S. at 574, 578, 581, 94 S.Ct. at 1247-1248, 1250, 1251-1252 (footnotesomitted).\nThe difference between \u201ctreats contemptuously\u201d and \u201ccasts contempt upon\u201d is constitutionally insignificant. We hold, therefore, that the portion of the statute punishing one who \u201ccasts contempt . . . upon\u201d the American flag is void for vagueness.\nAppellant was also accused of violating the statutory prohibition of \u201cdefiling\u201d the flag. This word, he argues, suffers from the same constitutional defect as \u201ccasts contempt.\u201d Were \u201cdefile\u201d construed broadly, we would be inclined to agree. \u201cDefiling\u201d the flag by wearing it, as appellant was charged, might mean to \u201cdebase, violate, pollute, sully, tarnish, or dishonor.\u201d So defined, \u201cdefile\u201d is not substantially different from \u201ccasts contempt upon\u201d and is equally vague.\nThe statute may be rescued from vagueness, however, by an appropriate limiting construction. We believe that, in the context of the specific words \u201cmutilates, defaces, ... or tramples upon,\u201d \u201cdefiles\u201d refers only to physical acts of destruction or desecration that affect the physical integrity of the flag. Hoffman v. United States, 144 U.S.App.D.C. 156, 445 F.2d 226, 229 (1971); Joyce v. United States, 147 U.S.App.D.C. 128, 454 F.2d 971, 981 (1971), cert. denied, 405 U.S. 969, 92 S.Ct. 1188, 31 L.Ed.2d 242 (1972); State v. Kasnett, 34 Ohio St.2d 193, 196, 297 N.E.2d 537, 540 (1973); State v. Hodsdon, 289 A.2d 635, 638 (Del.Super.1972); see Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa. S. \u00a7 1922(3) (Special Pamphlet, 1973); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7\u00a7 45.11, 47.16 (4th ed. C. Sands 1973); see also 1 Pa. S. \u00a7 1928(b) (1) (Special Pamphlet, 1973). So construed, \u201cdefiles\u201d is sufficiently concrete and definite to withstand a vagueness attack. Joyce v. United States, supra, 454 F.2d at 982-984; see Smith v. Goguen, supra, at 582 n. 30, 94 S.Ct. at 1251 n. 30.\nThe conduct with which Morgan was charged does not fall within this construction of \u201cdefiles.\u201d We doubt that sewing a flag to a piece of clothing constitutes physical desecration. In any event, Morgan was not charged with any act of physical desecration but that he \u201cdid defile ... by publicly wearing . . . .\u201d Wearing the flag sewn to appellant\u2019s pants was not a physical desecration and thus was not a defilement within the meaning of the statute as we have construed it. See Hoffman v. United States, supra (wearing flag as shirt is not defilement); State v. Kasnett, supra (wearing flag sewn to seat of pants does not constitute defilement); cf. Smith v. Goguen, supra, at 582, 94 S.Ct. at 1251.\nAppellant may not constitutionally be convicted of \u201ccast[ing] contempt upon\u201d the flag. The conduct with which he is charged does not come within the meaning of \u201cdefiles\u201d as a matter of statutory construction. Accordingly, as in Smith, Hoffman, and Kasnett, the conviction may not stand.\nJudgment of sentence reversed and appellant discharged.\nJONES, C. J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. Judges Hoffman, Spaulding, and Packel dissented.\n. Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204(a) (Supp.1974).\n. Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, \u00a7 211, as amended by Act of August 8, 1967, P.L. 201, \u00a7 1, 18 P.S. \u00a7 4211 (Supp.1973). This statute was repealed and replaced by 18 Pa. S. \u00a7 2102 (1973), which defines the offense in virtually identical language.\nThe \u201ccasts contempt ... by words\u201d portion of the statute is obviously unconstitutional. Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 89 S.Ct. 1354, 22 L.Ed. 572 (1969). That portion has been removed from the re-enacted version. In any event, this issue is not before us because appellant was charged with desecratory acts only.\n. Accord: Commonwealth v. Young, 229 Pa.Super. 470, 325 A.2d 315 (1974); Commonwealth v. Carney, 229 Pa.Super. 470, 325 A. 2d 316 (1974).\n. Cincinnati v. Bunch, 32 Ohio App.2d 161, 162, 288 N.E.2d 854, 855 (1971).\n. See, e. g., Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 382 U.S. 87, 91, 86 S.Ct. 211, 213-214, 15 L.Ed.2d 176 (1965).\n. \u201cEven if we were to accept the Commonwealth\u2019s interpretation in its brief that the statute proscribes only conduct affecting \u2018the physical integrity of a flag\u2019, and were to assume that, so limited, it could validly be applied, we are not so sure that sewing a flag to a background clearly affects \u2018physical integrity.\u2019 \u201d\nGoguen v. Smith, 471 F.2d 88, 91 n. 4 (1st Cir. 1972), aff\u2019d, 415 U.S. 566, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974).\n. We have not addressed Morgan\u2019s other, principally First Amendment, arguments because the void-for-vagueness doctrine and our construction of the language of the statute require the reversal of his conviction."}
