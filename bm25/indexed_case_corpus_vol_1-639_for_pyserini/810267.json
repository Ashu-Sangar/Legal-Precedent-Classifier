{"id": "810267", "contents": "Opinion,\nMr. Justice McCollum :\nThe paper-book in this case contains no argument in support of the specifications of error, and we might properly dismiss the appeal on that ground. It is apparent, however, that for the reasons given in our opinion in Guthrie\u2019s Appeal, No. 163 October Term 1889, ante, 492, the auditor was right in rejecting appellant\u2019s claims.\nDecree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at tbe cost of the appellant."}
