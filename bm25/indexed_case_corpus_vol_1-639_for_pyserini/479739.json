{"id": "479739", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThe appellant, Edward H. Kuterbach, was convicted by a jury of voluntary manslaughter. Post-verdict motions were denied and a sentence of five to fifteen years imprisonment was imposed. This appeal followed in which the only issues raised coneern alleged errors by the trial court in the admission of certain evidence introduced by the prosecution during the trial. Since the appellant did not object to the admission of that evidence when it was offered during the trial, no error was committed by the trial court. A rule of evidence is waived if it is not invoked when the evidence is offered, and the rule, having been waived, cannot subsequently be invoked on appeal. J. Wigmore, 1 Evidence \u00a718 (3d ed. 1940); see Commonwealth v. Little, 449 Pa. 28, 295 A.2d 287 (1972); Commonwealth v. Jones, 446 Pa. 223, 285 A.2d 447 (1971).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed."}
