{"id": "1740585", "contents": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nOn March 7, 1978, the last day for filing nomination petitions for the 1978 primary election, appellant submitted to the Secretary of the Commonwealth a petition entitled \u201cNomination Petition for the Office of Representative in Congress\u201d containing 237 signatures. The petition appeared to be in order except that in the body of the introduction to the petition, appellant erroneously stated that the petition was for the \u201c189th\u201d congressional district rather than for the \u201c1st\u201d congressional district.\nOn March 10, 1978, appellant received a letter from the Commissioner of Elections stating that said petition was rejected because the petition, by erroneously stating that it was for the \u201c189th\u201d congressional district rather than the \u201c1st\u201d congressional district, contained a \u201cmaterial error\u201d. The letter advised appellant he could file a mandamus action in Commonwealth Court. Accompanying the letter was the petition which appellant had earlier submitted to the Secretary of the Commonwealth.\nAppellant attempted to secure judicial relief from a Philadelphia Municipal Court judge wherein the judge drew two lines through the numerals \u201c189th\u201d as they appeared on the petition and inserted in print the word \u201cFirst\u201d. Appellant attempted to file the corrected petition with the Secretary of the Commonwealth; however, the petition was again rejected.\nAppellant then filed a complaint in mandamus in Commonwealth Court, seeking an order from said court directing the Secretary of the Commonwealth to accept his nomination petition as if timely filed and to place his name on the ballot in the 1978 primary election as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for representative to the United States Congress from the first congressional district. Commonwealth Court dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint. Appellant now appeals that dismissal.\nWe hold appellant\u2019s error of placing \u201c189th\u201d instead of \u201c1st\u201d on his nomination petition was not a \u201cmaterial error\u201d. The signers of appellant\u2019s petition could not have been misled by said error into thinking that appellant was running for a seat in the state assembly rather than for a seat in the United States Congress since the petition consistently referred to \u201cCongress\u201d in bold print \u2014 never did the words \u201cassembly\u201d or \u201clegislature\u201d appear on the petition. Since appellant\u2019s error was not \u201cmaterial\u201d, the Secretary of the Commonwealth should have accepted appellant\u2019s nomination petition.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the Secretary of the Commonwealth is ordered to accept appellant\u2019s nomination petition as if it was timely filed.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nROBERTS, J., concurs in the result.\nEAGEN, C. J., and O\u2019BRIEN and NIX, J., dissent.\nMANDERINO, J., concurs in the result.\n. The \u201c1st\u201d congressional district includes within its boundaries the \u201c189th\u201d state assembly district. There is no \u201c189th\u201d congressional district.\n. The Pennsylvania Election Code, Act of June 3, 1937, P.L. 1333, art. IX, \u00a7 976, as amended, 25 P.S. 2936 (1977-78 Supp.) provides that \u201cno nomination petition . . shall be permitted to be filed if \u2014 (a) it contains material errors or defects apparent on the face thereof . . .\u201d"}
