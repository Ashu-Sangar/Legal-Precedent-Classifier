{"id": "1156717", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nThis appeal is from a decree directing specific performance of an agreement to exchange two lots of ground, with the improvements thereon erected, in the City of Pittsburgh.\nBy contract dated April 7, 1927 (Exhibit A to the bill), plaintiffs \u2014 husband and wife \u2014 and appellants \u2014 \u2022 husband and wife \u2014 agreed to exchange two lots, describing them by metes and bounds, and providing that a mortgage in specified amount should be placed on each property. Attached to this contract were riders, in which plaintiffs\u2019 property was designated as \u201cthe Phillips Avenue property\u201d and the defendants\u2019 as \u201cthe Ridge-wood Street property.\u201d April 17, 1931, a supplemental agreement (Exhibit B) was executed, referring to the properties by the same designations.\nJuly 21, 1931, a third agreement (Exhibit 0) was made. In part it provides (italics ours) :\n\u201cWhereas, said parties entered into an Agreement dated April 7, 1931, and by riders dated April 17, 1931, covenanted and agreed to sell certain properties,\nAnd Whereas, the parties have now reached a complete understanding with respect to the terms governing the sale of said properties,\n\u201cNow, Therefore, it is hereby understood and agreed that this Agreement shall take the place of any prior Agreements and be in detail the understanding and agreement which the said parties have concerning the transfer of said properties\nIn this agreement, plaintiffs\u2019 property was designated as \u201cthe property at 5530 Phillips Avenue\u201d; and defendants\u2019 as \u201cthe property at No. 1997-99 Perrysville Avenue.\u201d Selecting merely those descriptive terms, appellants contend that the land is not sufficiently described to be made the subject of a decree of specific performance; that the terms of the agreement of July 21st exclude reference to the earlier contracts for the purpose of identifying \u201cthe property at No. 1997-99 Perrysville Avenue\u201d by metes and bounds.\nThe contention is without merit: the preamble to the agreement of July 21, 1931 (quoted above) shows that it provides for the transfer of the properties particularly described in the first contract. Between the date of the original agreement and July 21st, plaintiffs had secured the required mortgage on their property, thus rendering the second rider to the contract of April 7th and the supplemental agreement of the 17th inappropriate. In consequence of this change of circumstances, a new contract which (in the words of the parties already quoted) would \u201cbe in detail the understanding and agreement which the said parties have concerning the transfer of said properties\u201d became necessary. This contract took the place of prior agreements as to the terms of the transfer, but it clearly appears that it referred to the same properties.\nWhile defendants\u2019 lot is referred to in Exhibit C as \u201cthe property at No. 1997-99 Perrysville Avenue,\u201d rather than as \u201cthe Ridgewood Street Property,\u201d the bill alleges that Perrysville Avenue is also called Ridgewood Street, a fact not denied in the answer, making clear the connection between the contract of April 7th and Exhibit C: Weisenberger v. Huebner, 264 Pa. 316, 319, 107 A. 763; Weaver v. Shenk, 154 Pa. 206, 208, 26 A. 811; see, too, Ross v. Baker, 72 Pa. 186; Henry v. Black, 210 Pa. 245, 59 A. 1070; Whiteside v. Winans, 29 Pa. Superior Ct. 244.\nDefendants contend that they should not be ordered to make the mortgage agreed upon, and cite cases from other jurisdictions holding that, for breach of a mere contract to lend or borrow money or to place a mortgage, the remedy is at law and not in equity. These are inapplicable, since this is not a mere contract to mortgage in the absence of special circumstances. Here the obligation to mortgage is a mere incident to the contract to exchange. The bill alleged, and the Kosters\u2019 answer admitted, that they had arranged to borrow from the Allegheny Trust Company the sum of $15,000 and secure the loan on the premises in question. Defendants offered no evidence on this subject.\nThere is no basis for the complaint that a surviving party was allowed to testify in violation of the Evidence Act of 1887.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
