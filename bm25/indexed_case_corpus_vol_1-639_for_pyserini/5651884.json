{"id": "5651884", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nExel Logistics appeals from the order of the Commonwealth Court reversing the order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB), which granted Supersedeas Fund reimbursement. We affirm.\nAppellant issued a notice of compensation payable after claimant sustained a work-related shoulder injury while employed at appellant\u2019s business in May, 1993. In August, 1997, pursuant to \u00a7 306(f.l)(8) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, appellant filed a petition for forfeiture, alleging claimant refused reasonable medical treatment, and requested a supersedeas while its petition was pending. In January, 1998, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge (WCJ) denied appellant\u2019s request for supersedeas; appellant continued to pay compensation and medical benefits. In January, 1999, the WCJ granted appellant\u2019s petition for forfeiture for the period July 14, 1995, through September 30, 1998, finding claimant refused reasonable medical treatment.\nAppellant filed a petition for Supersedeas Fund reimbursement, requesting $17,798.67 in compensation and $1,375.25 in medical bills paid while its forfeiture petition was pending. The WCJ denied appellant\u2019s petition, finding it did not fulfill the requirements for Supersedeas Fund reimbursement because the request for forfeiture was made pursuant to \u00a7 306(f.l)(8), and not pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 413 or 430 of the Act. The WCAB, however, granted appellant\u2019s request for Supersedeas Fund reimbursement, concluding the request fell under \u00a7 430. The Commonwealth Court reversed, holding \u00a7 443 specifically provides for Supersedeas Fund reimbursement only where the request was under \u00a7\u00a7 413 or 430; \u00a7 306(f.l)(8) itself does not allow for reimbursement. Bureau of Workers\u2019 Comp. v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Exel Logistics), 827 A.2d 529, 533 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003). We granted review to consider the application of \u00a7 443 in the context of forfeiture petitions under \u00a7 306(f.l)(8).\nThis Court\u2019s appellate review in workers\u2019 compensation matters is limited to determining whether an error of law was committed, whether constitutional rights were violated, whether practices or procedures of a Commonwealth agency were followed, and whether necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 704; Hanna-berry HVAC v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Bd. (Snyder, Jr.), 575 Pa. 66, 834 A.2d 524, 527 (2003). In examining questions of law, our scope of review is plenary. Daniels v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Bd. (Tristate Transp.), 574 Pa. 61, 828 A.2d 1043, 1046-1047 (2003).\nAppellant argues the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision is unreasonable and absurd in that it allows an injured worker to refuse reasonable medical treatment without the loss of benefits and penalizes an employer by disallowing Supersedeas Fund reimbursement, thus leaving an employer no possibility of monetary recovery. Appellant contends forfeiture petitions under \u00a7 306(f.l)(8) have been equated with suspension petitions under \u00a7 413, and that the result here conflicts with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s own precedent.\nThe Commonwealth Court has held where a claimant forfeits his right to compensation by refusing reasonable medical treatment, a petition for suspension of benefits is properly granted. See Litak v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Com-cast Cablevision), 155 Pa.Cmwlth. 147, 624 A.2d 773, 775 (1993); see also Davis v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd. (Acme Markets, Inc.), 711 A.2d 1096 (Pa.Cmwlth.1998) (grant of suspension petition filed in accordance with \u00a7 413 proper where reasonable treatment refused by claimant); Stuart Painting Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Asvestas), 148 Pa.Cmwlth. 411, 611 A.2d 787 (1992) (suspension of benefits for claimant\u2019s refusal to submit to reasonable medical services); Donton v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Prestolite Battery), 125 Pa.Cmwlth. 324, 557 A.2d 450.(1989) (suspension of compensation proper for refusal of reasonable treatment).\nThese cases reflect a sometimes casual use of the term \u201csuspension.\u201d While each turns on the claimant\u2019s refusal of reasonable treatment as required by \u00a7 306, each specifically deals with a petition for suspension. None of these cases hold that a petition alleging the forfeiture of the right to compensation is the same as a petition seeking suspension of benefits. A claimant forfeits his right to benefits when he refuses reasonable medical services for his work-related injuries. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 531(8). An employer may seek a suspension of benefits for other reasons, however, such as an improvement in earning power altering a claimant\u2019s need for benefits. See Pieper v. Ametek-Thermox Instruments Div., 526 Pa. 25, 584 A.2d 301, 304-05 (1990) (\u201cA \u2018suspension of benefits\u2019 is supported by a finding that the earning power of the claimant is no longer affected by his disability, whether it arises from his employer offering suitable replacement employment, or from the ability of the claimant to secure other suitable employment that provides equal or greater compensation.\u201d). Forfeiture is based on the claimant\u2019s own unwillingness to receive treatment rather than a change in status. With forfeiture, there is no requirement of a change which alters a claimant\u2019s right to benefits, as exists with a suspension of benefits. Because appellant\u2019s petition was under the forfeiture section, it was not a suspension petition, and cannot fall under \u00a7 413; thus, appellant is not entitled to reimbursement from the Supersedeas Fund.\nFurther, contrary to the conclusion of the WCAB, a forfeiture petition does not fall under \u00a7 430. Section 430 prohibits an employer from terminating, decreasing, or refusing to make a payment after benefits have been awarded without first filing and being granted a supersedeas. An employer filing a forfeiture petition, however, is not contesting disability but rather is alleging a claimant has forfeited his right to benefits by refusing reasonable medical treatment.\nAppellant contends Commonwealth Court precedent has permitted Supersedeas Fund relief for petitions filed under \u00a7 306(f) of the Act for medical expenses ultimately determined to have been erroneously paid. Dep\u2019t of Labor and Indus. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Commercial Union Ins. Co.), 137 Pa.Cmwlth. 387, 586 A.2d 496, 499 (1991), aff'd per curiam, 533 Pa. 112, 619 A.2d 1356 (1993), and Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Kline and Packard Press), 137 Pa.Cmwlth. 393, 586 A.2d 500, 502-03 (1991), aff'd per curiam, 533 Pa. 112, 619 A.2d 1356 (1993), decided that compensation under \u00a7 443 of the Act was deemed to include medical expenses and thus, reimbursement could be obtained from the Supersedeas Fund for such expenses. Once again, we are not persuaded by these decisions that a petition for forfeiture is the equivalent to a petition for suspension or termination under \u00a7 413 or \u00a7 430, and find the plain language of \u00a7 443 does not authorize reimbursement to employers seeking relief under \u00a7 306(f) of the Act.\nSection 443(b) of the Act speaks of the establishment of the Supersedeas Fund with the purpose of providing moneys for payments pursuant to \u00a7 443(a). See 77 P.S. \u00a7 999(b). Looking at the plain language of subsection (a), the supersedeas must have been requested under \u00a7 413 or \u00a7 430, to warrant reimbursement. See id., \u00a7 999(a). Simply put, \u00a7 443 does not authorize reimbursement for a \u00a7 306(f) claim, and the language of \u00a7 306(f) itself does not allow supersedeas reimbursement. Based on the plain language of the statute, Supersedeas Fund reimbursement is not available for petitions filed under \u00a7 306(f.l)(8).\nOrder affirmed.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justices NIGRO and SAYLOR join the opinion.\nJustice NEWMAN files a dissenting opinion in which Justices CASTILLE and BAER join.\n. Section 306(f.l)(8) provides:\nIf the employe shall refuse reasonable services of health care providers, surgical, medical and hospital services, treatment, medicines and supplies, he shall forfeit all rights to compensation for any injury or increase in his incapacity shown to have resulted from such refusal.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 531(8).\n. Section 413 provides:\n(1) The filing of a petition to terminate, suspend or modify a notice of compensation payable or a compensation agreement or award as provided in this section shall automatically operate as a request for a supersedeas to suspend the payment of compensation fixed in the agreement or the award where the petition alleges that the employe has fully recovered and is accompanied by an affidavit of a physician on a form prescribed by the department to that effect, which is based upon an examination made within twenty-one days of the filing of the petition. A special supersedeas hearing before a workers\u2019 compensation judge shall be held within twenty-one days of the assignment of such petition....\n(2) In any other case, a petition to terminate, suspend or modify a compensation agreement or other payment arrangement or award as provided in this section shall not automatically operate as a supersedeas but may be designated as a request for a supersedeas, which may then be granted at the discretion of the workers\u2019 compensation judge hearing the case. ...\n77 P.S. \u00a7 774.\n. Section 430 provides:\n(a) The lien of any judgment entered upon any award shall not be divested by any appeal.\n(b) Any insurer or employer who terminates, decreases or refuses to make any payment provided for in the decision without filing a petition and being granted a supersedeas shall be subject to a penalty as provided in section 435, except in the case of payments terminated as provided in section 434.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 971.\n. Section 443 provides:\nIf, in any case in which a supersedeas has been requested and denied under the provisions of section 413 or section 430, payments of compensation are made as a result thereof and upon the final outcome of the proceedings, it is determined that such compensation was not, in fact, payable, the insurer who has made such payments shall be reimbursed therefor....\n77 P.S. \u00a7 999(a).\n. At the time Dep\u2019t of Labor and Indus. v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Commercial Union Ins. Co.), 137 Pa.Cmwlth. 387, 586 A.2d 496 (1991), aff\u2019d per curiam, 533 Pa. 112, 619 A.2d 1356 (1993), and Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Workmen's Comp. Appeal Bd. (Kline and Packard Press), 137 Pa.Cmwlth. 393, 586 A.2d 500 (1991), aff'd. per curiam, 533 Pa. 112, 619 A.2d 1356 (1993), were decided, \u00a7 306(f) read:\nThe employer shall have the right to petition the department for review of the necessity or frequency of treatment or reasonableness of fees for services provided.... Such a petition shall in no event act as a supersedeas, and during the pendency of any such petition the employer shall pay all medical bills if the physician or other practitioner ... files a report or reports as required by subparagraph (I) of paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 531."}
