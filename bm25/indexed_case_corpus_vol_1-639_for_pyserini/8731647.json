{"id": "8731647", "contents": "OPINION\nKAUFFMAN, Justice.\nThis is an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a pretrial motion to dismiss the charge of first degree murder under an indictment for murder generally.\nIn September, 1977, after having negotiated a plea bargain with the District Attorney of Erie County, appellant, Bruce Earl Ward, pleaded guilty to murder generally. Under the terms of the plea agreement, it was stipulated that the degree of murder adjudicated would rise no higher than murder of the second degree. The trial court accepted the plea and stipulation, and, after a degree of guilt hearing in November, 1977, found appellant guilty of second degree murder.\nThe plea was challenged subsequently on direct appeal. This Court held the plea colloquy inadequate, reversed the judgment of sentence and granted a new trial. Commonwealth v. Ward, 483 Pa. 53, 394 A.2d 535 (1978). Venue was transferred to Beaver County, where the appellant filed the instant motion, claiming that the Commonwealth\u2019s intention to proceed against him on a charge of first degree murder would place him twice in jeopardy for that crime. Our allowance of interlocutory appeal is predicated solely on the double jeopardy claim pursuant to our holding in Commonwealth v. Bolden, 472 Pa. 602, 373 A.2d 90 (1977).\nThe double jeopardy question raised here was addressed in Commonwealth v. Klobuchir, 486 Pa. 241, 405 A.2d 881 (1979) and Commonwealth v. Tabb, 491 Pa. 372, 421 A.2d 183 (1980). The due process claim was not before the Court in either Klobuchir or Tabb, but the Opinions in Support of Reversal in Klobuchir and the Dissenting Opinions in Tabb alluded to it, both directly, by suggesting disposition of the issue under an assumption of plenary jurisdiction, and indirectly, by combining discussion of due process issues with the merits of the double jeopardy claim. In order to put an end to the uncertainty surrounding these related issues, we will address the due process claim in this case under our plenary jurisdiction.\nAppellant relies upon, and recognizes that the strength of his claim derives entirely from, the Opinions in Support of Reversal in Klobuchir, supra. It will thus be necessary to address some of the arguments made therein (and, incidentally, in Mr. Justice Roberts\u2019 dissent in Tabb) while disposing of both the double jeopardy and the due process issues raised here.\nI\nThe defense of double jeopardy could be sustained here if, and only if, an \u201cimplied acquittal\u201d had occurred under the rationale of Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957). In Green, the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant who has once been tried by a jury on a greater charge but convicted only of a lesser included offense, and who has successfully attacked his conviction on appeal, may not subsequently be tried again on the greater charge. When presented with the option of convicting for first degree murder or a lesser offense, the jury in Green chose to convict for second degree murder, thus implicitly acquitting of and barring further prosecution on the first degree murder charge.\nThe due process claim arises out of the possibility that invocation of a defendant\u2019s appellate rights may be chilled by fear that greater punishment would be imposed after a successful appeal or collateral attack. It is clear, however, from decisions of the United States Supreme Court and the unanimous position of numerous federal appellate and trial courts, that due process standards would be violated by the inhibition of appellate rights only where an implied acquittal has in fact taken place or when increased punishment results solely from judicial or prosecutorial vindictiveness toward the defendant for having pursued a successful appeal or collateral attack on his original conviction.\nII\nThe essential question underlying the issue of \u201cimplied acquittal\u201d is whether an actual adjudication has taken place on the merits of the charges sought to be stricken on retrial. The Majority Opinion in Tabb, supra, and the Opinion in Support of Affirmance in Klobuchir, supra, concluded that \u201cthe sine qua non for finding implicit acquittal is a failure to convict in the face of full opportunity for conviction\u201d (Tabb, slip opin. p. 6, 421 A.2d 186, emphasis added; Klobuchir, 405 A.2d at 886). This result is based on the unequivocal language in Green, supra, 355 U.S. at 190, 78 S.Ct. at 225, revealing quite clearly why the Supreme Court there concluded that an \u201cimplicit acquittal\u201d had occurred:\nGreen was in direct peril of being convicted and punished for first degree murder at his first trial. He was forced to run the gantlet once on that charge and the jury refused to convict him. When given the choice between finding him guilty of either first or second degree-murder it chose the latter. In this situation the great majority of cases in this country have regarded the jury\u2019s verdict as an implicit acquittal on the charge of first degree murder. . . . [The jury] was given a full opportunity to return a verdict and no extraordinary circumstances appeared which prevented it from doing so. Therefore it seems clear, under established principles of former jeopardy, that Green\u2019s jeopardy for first degree murder came to an end when the jury was discharged. . . . (Emphasis supplied)\nRelying upon the following language from Mr. Justice Roberts\u2019 Opinion in Support of Reversal in Klobuchir, appellant here suggests that the theory of implied acquittal in Green is applicable where the former conviction rests on the trial judge\u2019s acceptance of a guilty plea pursuant to a plea bargain:\nIn view of the trial court\u2019s authority in Pennsylvania to reject a negotiated plea, an adjudication in which it is determined that the plea is supported by a factual basis and in which the plea of guilty is accepted, necessarily includes the court\u2019s rejection of greater degrees of guilt. 486 Pa. at 262, 405 A.2d at 1368-69.\nWe refuse to adopt the premise, however, that a plea agreement affords an \u201copportunity\u201d to rule on the merits of charges not embraced by the plea. By definition, the plea bargain eliminates the greater charges from consideration. The trial judge here was limited to the options of accepting or rejecting the plea and stipulation of degree. Once the plea was accepted, the first degree murder charge was excluded from any further inquiry into the degree of guilt. Although a trial court\u2019s acceptance of a guilty plea must be predicated upon an adjudication that there is a factual basis to support the plea, that conclusion only assures that the crime to which the plea is addressed actually occurred; it does not rule out the possibility that the crime adjudicated may be a lesser offense included in a more serious criminal transaction. As such, it does not evidence any opportunity, much less a \u201cfull\u201d opportunity, to rule on the greater charges as required under Green.\nIn United States v. Scott, 437 U.S. 82, 98 S.Ct. 2187, 57 L.Ed.2d 65 (1978), the United States Supreme Court ruled that \u201ca defendant is acquitted only when \u2018the ruling of a judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution [in defendant\u2019s favor], correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged\u2019 \u201d, (emphasis added) 437 U.S. at 97, 98 S.Ct. at 2197, quoting from United States v. Martin Linen, 430 U.S. 564, 97 S.Ct. 1349, 51 L.Ed.2d 642 (1977). In United States v. Williams, 534 F.2d 119 (8th Cir.) cert. denied, 429 U.S. 894, 97 S.Ct. 255, 50 L.Ed.2d 177 (1976), a case involving degrees of bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113, the Eighth Circuit dealt with a claim of \u201cimplicit acquittal\u201d arising out of the acceptance of a guilty plea on lesser offenses within the indictment. The Court distinguished the case from one in which the rationale of Green v. United States, supra, and a case essentially identical to Green with respect to the issue at bar, Price v. Georgia, 398 U.S. 323, 90 S.Ct. 1757, 26 L.Ed.2d 300 (1970), would apply:\nDefendant contends that his position is, for double jeopardy purposes, indistinguishable from that of Green or Price, that it is immaterial whether the former conviction on the lesser charge resulted from a trial on both the greater and lesser charges or from a plea to the lesser charge only. We cannot agree. The Court in Price, supra, 398 U.S. at 328-29, 90 S.Ct. at 1760-61, 26 L.Ed.2d at 304-05, states that its holdings in both Green and Price rest on two premises. First, a jury\u2019s verdict of guilty on a lesser charge is an \u201cimplicit acquittal\u201d on the greater charge. Second, a defendant\u2019s jeopardy on the greater charge ends when the first jury is given a \u201cfull opportunity\u201d to return a verdict on that charge and instead returns a verdict on the lesser charge only. Neither premise is applicable when the original conviction on the lesser charge follows a guilty plea rather than a trial on both charges. . . .\n. . . Williams was not, in the proceedings in which his guilty plea was accepted, in direct peril of being convicted and punished for violating \u00a7 2113(d) and (e). He was not forced to run the gantlet on those charges. No trier of fact refused to convict him on those charges or the \u00a7 2113(a) charge. The district judge had the sole options of accepting or rejecting the plea on the \u00a7 2113(a) charge. By accepting it, he made no determination, explicit or implicit, on the merits of the charges not embraced in the plea. There was no implicit acquittal. The second premise of Green and Price is patently inapplicable where the former conviction rests on a guilty plea. A plea to a lesser charge necessarily deprives court and jury of an opportunity to consider the greater charge.\n534 F.2d at 121-122. (Emphasis supplied)\nPursuant to a plea bargain, the prosecution in the case before us certified that the degree of murder adjudicated would go no higher than second degree. Although a substantial colloquy took place with respect to the degree of guilt, it was restricted to the question of whether the crime was murder of the second or of the third degree. At no time did the trial court have the option to adjudicate the merits of a charge of first degree murder. By the terms of the plea bargain, its inquiry was limited to consideration of second degree murder or a lesser offense. Appellant was not \u201cin direct peril\u201d of being convicted and punished for first degree murder.\nMr. Justice Roberts\u2019 dissent in Tabb, supra, suggested that by its willingness to certify guilt to a lesser degree than the evidence would support, the Commonwealth acknowledged that justice would be adequately served if a conviction and sentence on the lesser charge were entered against the defendant. To the extent that this may be so in the plea bargain context, it is grounded upon society\u2019s interest in prompt and efficient administration of criminal justice and the conservation of limited judicial resources. The framework of the plea bargaining system would be undermined, however, by the suggestion that acceptance of a plea to a lesser offense constitutes an adjudication in defendant\u2019s favor of a greater offense otherwise supported by the evidence. For when the defendant refuses a bargain, it is presumed that the prosecution will proceed on the greater charges. If the defendant were permitted to accept a bargain and then revoke his part while leaving the prosecution bound, the entire purpose of plea bargaining would be defeated. Every defendant would find it in his interest to plead and then challenge his plea after sentencing. Every plea would thus require subsequent litigation, and if successfully revoked, would be followed by the very trial and consumption of judicial resources which the bargain supposedly had precluded. As a result, the criminal justice system would become more clogged with litigation than if there were no plea bargaining. This bizarre scenario was rejected by the Second Circuit in United States ex rel. Williams v. McCann, 436 F.2d 103 (2nd Cir., 1970) where the appellant, having withdrawn a guilty plea to a lesser offense, received a longer sentence after trial and conviction of the greater offense originally charged:\nFor us to hold that one in Williams\u2019 position may not be tried and sentenced upon the charge originally brought would encourage gamesmanship of a most offensive nature. Defendants would be rewarded for prevailing upon the prosecutor to accept a reduced charge and to recommend a lighter punishment in return for a guilty plea, when the defendant intended at the time he entered that plea to attack it at some future date . . . [A]ny reason defendant could conceive for setting aside his plea and sentence would lose him little. If the defendant\u2019s argument were to prevail, then a trial on the lesser charge only could result. The defendant would thus run no risks by this maneuver for his trial could end in acquittal, but if he should be convicted, he urges he could not receive a sentence greater than that imposed on the guilty plea to the lesser offense. This is nothing more than a \u201cheads-I-win-tails-you-lose\u201d gamble. To frustrate this strategy, prosecutors would be restrained from entering plea bargains, thereby adding further to the staggering burdens of our criminal courts, and judges would become more rigid in exercising their discretion in favor of permitting withdrawal of a guilty plea. This would hardly enhance the administration of criminal justice.\n436 F.2d at 107.\nThe participation of a defendant in the negotiation of a plea bargain successfully terminates trial proceedings that, would otherwise determine the issue of guilt or innocence on all charges. Such action by the defendant, \u201cis deemed to be a deliberate election on his part to forgo his valued right to have his guilt or innocence determined before the first trier of fact.\u201d Scott, supra, 437 U.S. at 93, 98 S.Ct. at 2194. This decision is made to avoid the potentially more severe consequences of going to trial. When the defendant\u2019s own action prevents adjudication of the greater charges, it is absurd to suggest that, in the event the defendant reneges on his plea agreement, the government has relinquished its right to prosecute on those charges. The government simply has made a bargain which it is obligated to keep only so long as the defendant is willing to abide by its terms. When a defendant abrogates a plea agreement, he resumes his prea-greement status, and the government may proceed on the original charges as if the agreement had never existed. This was illustrated by the holding in United States v. Anderson, 514 F.2d 583 (7th Cir. 1975), a case involving the same statute and the same question as United States v. Williams, supra:\nThe Government here did not unequivocally relinquish its right to prosecute Anderson for violating section 2113(d). Instead, it conditionally relinquished this right provided Anderson was convicted of and remained convicted of the section 2113(b) offense. This is in direct contrast to Green in which the implicit acquittal on the greater charge was in no sense contingent on the continued viability of the conviction for the lesser offense. When the section 2113(b) conviction was vacated the condition precedent to the Government\u2019s agreement not to prosecute no longer existed. The Government was then free to prosecute Anderson for the section 2113(d) charge without placing him twice in jeopardy. To hold otherwise is to find that the Double Jeopardy Clause gives the defendant more than the \u201cbenefit of his bargain\u201d and ensures that he not even be placed in jeopardy once ....\n514 F.2d at 587.\nA \u201cmutuality of advantage\u201d to defendants and prosecutors flows from the ratification of the bargain. Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 752, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1471, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970). When a defendant withdraws or successfully challenges his plea, the bargain is abrogated and he must be prepared to accept all of the consequences which the plea originally sought to avoid.\nIll\nTo require a defendant, as the price for successfully pursuing an appeal of his original conviction, to run the gauntlet a second time on a charge of which he implicitly had been acquitted would violate the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy. This principle was clearly articulated in Green v. United States, supra:\nThe law should not, and in our judgment does not, place the defendant in such an incredible dilemma. Conditioning an appeal of one offense on a coerced surrender of a valid plea of former jeopardy on another offense exacts a forfeiture in plain conflict with the constitutional bar against double jeopardy.\n355 U.S. 193-194, 78 S.Ct. 226-227. Implicit in this finding is a determination that the chilling effect on appellate rights resulting from such coercion would be offensive to constitutional principles of due process of law. The \u201cforfeiture\u201d apprehended in Green cannot, however, occur in the absence of an implied acquittal in the earlier proceedings.\nIt is true, as noted in Mr. Justice Roberts\u2019 Opinion in Support of Reversal in Klobuchir, supra, 486 Pa. 263, 405 A.2d 881, that so long as a defendant\u2019s guilty plea and consequent sentence go undisturbed, he is protected from conviction on a greater offense originally charged. That he must relinquish such protection should he be successful in challenging his guilty plea in no way, however, creates the \u201cdilemma\u201d contemplated in Green. Green explicitly held only that a violation of due process occurs when an appeal is conditioned on a coerced surrender of a valid plea of former jeopardy. Without an \u201cimplied acquittal,\u201d it is clear that, under Green, the claim of former jeopardy cannot be sustained. As we have concluded that there is no implied acquittal where the former conviction rests on a guilty plea accepted pursuant to a plea bargain, there can be no valid claim of former jeopardy in this case. In the absence of a valid claim of former jeopardy, the defendant\u2019s decision to abandon the protection afforded by his guilty plea cannot invoke the constitutional bar against double jeopardy, nor does it invoke a due process claim analogous to that which underlies Green.\nThe due process principle was extended in North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656 (1969) which, along with its companion case, Simpson v. Rice, concerned prisoners who had successfully attacked their convictions for assault and burglary and had received substantially longer sentences upon reconviction for the same offenses; and in Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U.S. 21, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974) where a prosecutor brought a greater charge when the defendant, after conviction, exercised his state statutory right to a trial de novo in a higher court. Pearce held that the imposition of a longer sentence in retaliation for a defendant\u2019s successful attack on his first conviction would be an unconstitutional deterrent to the exercise of appellate rights. Perry held that prosecutorial vindictiveness, i. e. \u201cupping the ante\u201d on charges to deter a challenge to the original conviction, was similarly offensive.\nInhibition of the exercise of appellate rights does not by itself, however, invoke a due process claim under Pearce or Perry unless actual vindictiveness or, at the very least, a clearly perceived potential for vindictiveness by a judge or prosecutor can be demonstrated. In Perry, the Supreme Court held, \u201cThe Due Process Clause is not offended by all possibilities of increased punishment upon retrial after appeal, but only by those that pose a realistic likelihood of \u2018vindictiveness\u2019.\u201d 417 U.S. at 27, 94 S.Ct. at 2102. And in United States ex rel. Williams, supra, the Second Circuit noted that:\nPearce expressly rejected arguments that inhibiting the invocation of appellate and collateral proceedings was by itself constitutionally offensive. Pearce sought to remedy only those restraints to pursue a remedy which vindictiveness might impose. We note also that the Supreme Court has upheld the validity of plea bargains entered into because of the threat of a more severe sentence following a jury trial, despite the fact that such bargains inhibit the defendant\u2019s exercise of his right to trial by jury.\n436 F.2d at 106.\nAppellant here asks us to hold that mere reinstatement of the original indictment would be an unconstitutional deterrent to the exercise of appellate rights. But, as noted above by the Second Circuit, in plea bargaining the plea is always induced by confronting the defendant with the risk of more severe punishment if jury trial rights are exercised. In the event the plea offer is refused, the prosecutor is never prevented by due process principles from proceeding on the original indictment, notwithstanding the fact that he has deliberately attempted to dissuade the defendant from asserting a constitutional right. The Supreme Court recently underscored its approval of this principle in Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 98 S.Ct. 663, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978), with the following observation:\nWhile confronting a defendant with the risk of more severe punishment clearly may have a \u201cdiscouraging effect on the defendant\u2019s assertion of his trial rights, the imposition of these difficult choices [is] an inevitable\u201d\u2014 and permissible \u2014 \u201cattribute of any legitimate system which tolerates and encourages the negotiation of pleas.\u201d [citation omitted]. It follows that, by tolerating and encouraging the negotiation of pleas, this Court has necessarily accepted as constitutionally legitimate the simple reality that the prosecutor\u2019s interest at the bargaining table is to persuade the defendant to forgo his right to plead not guilty.\n434 U.S. at 364, 98 S.Ct. at 668. If the Due Process Clause does not bar prosecution on the original indictment after the defendant\u2019s refusal of a plea bargain offer, then it cannot bar reinstatement of the original indictment after revocation of a plea agreement.\nIn Bordenkircher, a prosecutor carried out a threat made during plea negotiation to bring a new indictment charging the defendant as a habitual offender (invoking a mandatory life sentence) when the defendant refused to plead guilty to the original felony indictment (on which the maximum sentence was 10 years, and the defendant had been offered a prosecutor\u2019s recommendation of 5 years). A jury found the defendant guilty of the principal felony charge and he was sentenced to a life term. Despite the allegation that the prosecutor had brought the new expanded indictment in retaliation for the defendant\u2019s refusal to abandon his right to a jury trial, the Court affirmed the conviction, finding that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct did no more than openly present the defendant with the alternatives of foregoing trial or facing charges on which he plainly was subject to prosecution under the recidivist statute. Since the Supreme Court has permitted the threat of increased charges at the plea negotiation stage, mere reinstatement of the original charges after an accused successfully has revoked a plea agreement, a fortiori would not offend constitutional principles of due process.\nPearce and its companion case, however, demonstrated actual, palpable vindictiveness on the part of the state. They involved the threat of a penalty unmistakably exacted in retaliation for pursuit of appellate rights. But even under the most liberal view of the Pearce doctrine, vindictiveness toward appellant here could not be shown.\nEven prior to Bordenkircher, the various United States Courts of Appeals unanimously held that the threshold event required for a showing of judicial or prosecutorial vindictiveness would be the imposition, after the defendant\u2019s exercise of a statutory or constitutional right, of more severe charges or penalties than those included in or contemplated under the original indictment. Many of those Circuits had already provided prosecutors with broad latitude to justify increased charges, notwithstanding the \u201cappearance\u201d of vindictiveness. Bordenkircher simply clarified the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the standards implicit in Pearce, supra, and Perry, supra. In the wake of Bordenkircher, the Court of Appeals became unanimous in holding that even a prima facie case of prosecutorial vindictiveness would be subject to rebuttal by evidence explaining or justifying the action taken, thus negating any inference of actual vindictiveness.\nAt no time, however, has any federal court held that reinstatement of original charges after a defendant\u2019s challenge to a negotiated plea would constitute prosecutorial vindictiveness. Not even the appearance of retaliation arises when a defendant simply is returned to his pre-agreement status after successfully abrogating his part of the plea bargain. Pearce and Perry are thus inapposite to Klobuchir and Tabb as well as to the case before us.\nNevertheless, appellant seeks to contrive the due process claim by equating the mere reinstatement of original charges with prosecutorial \u201cvindictiveness.\u201d Apart from the fact that appellant\u2019s position is incompatible with the unanimous weight of federal authority, his view is entirely unsupportable since a prosecutor would be derelict in his duty if he did not, in the absence of a plea bargain, seek conviction on charges supported by the evidence. In United States ex rel. Williams, supra, the Second Circuit observed:\nWilliams concedes that the original reduction from sale to attempted sale was the result of an express agreement with the prosecutor given in consideration of his plea of guilty. When Williams was successful in revoking his part of the bargain by having his plea of guilty set aside, it is hardly surprising, and scarcely suggestive of vindictiveness, that the district attorney in turn withdrew his consent to the reduced charge. Indeed, all that happened was that the prosecution was forced to proceed on the original charge which the grand jury had returned in the first instance.\n436 F.2d at 106.\nThe charges contained in the indictment upon which appellant is to be tried are the same as those contained in the original indictment. Nothing in the present record approaches even the appearance of prosecutorial vindictiveness. Appellant revoked his bargain. Accordingly, he must be prepared to resume his pre-agreement status.\nWe conclude, then, that retrial on the original indictment would offend neither federal nor Pennsylvania double jeopardy or due process standards and that the order of the Court of Common Pleas must be affirmed.\nOrder affirmed.\nNIX, J., filed a concurring opinion joined by O\u2019BRIEN, C. J. \u2022\nLARSEN and FLAHERTY, JJ., filed concurring opinions.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Appellant has also requested review of the trial court order on due process and equal protection grounds. While we specifically decline to expand the scope of interlocutory review under Bolden, we note that the due process question herein has been a source of disagreement and confusion in double jeopardy matters before this Court on several occasions and should now be laid to rest.\n. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722.\n. See Van Alstyne, In Gideon\u2019s Wake: Harsher Penalties and the \u201cSuccessful\u201d Criminal Appellant, 74 Yale L.J. 606 (1965).\n. It is further noted in the Opinion in Support of Reversal in Klobuchir that \u201cuntil the defendant was formally adjudicated guilty of murder of the [lesser] degree he was at risk of conviction of a higher degree of homicide.\u201d 486 Pa. at 261, 405 A.2d 881. Although this is certainly true, it illustrates only that the trial court remains free to reject the terms of the plea bargain until sentence has been imposed. It says absolutely nothing about whether the trial court has adjudicated the issue of guilt on the greater charges.\n. As Mr. Justice Nix pointed out in Klobuchir,\n\u201cNor does the fact that the Court accepted the plea necessarily suggest an implicit conclusion that the evidence might not also support a higher degree of the crime of murder. There are many considerations that would justify the acceptance of a plea for a lesser degree than the evidence might support.\u201d 486 A.2d at 252; 405 A.2d at 886-87.\n. See The Supreme Court, 1969 Term, 84 Harv.L.Rev. 30, 150 (1970) (with a significant reduction in the proportion of cases terminated by guilty plea, \u201cthe criminal justice system would shift from its present low gear to a halt\u201d).\n. Pearce and Rice were consolidated for decision by the Supreme Court and are reported together at 395 U.S. 711, 89 S.Ct. 2072, 23 L.Ed.2d 656.\n. See North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970); Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U.S. 17, 93 S.Ct. 1977, 36 L.Ed.2d 714 (1973).\n. See ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Pleas of Guilty \u00a7 3.1 (App. Draft 1968); Note, Plea Bargaining and the Transformation of the Criminal Process, 90 Harv.L.Rev. 564 (1977).\n. It undoubtedly would violate the due process rights of an accused, however, if the prosecutor were to threaten him with increased charges without first having at least prima facie evidence that the accused had in fact committed the more serious crimes.\n. To illustrate: In Simpson v. Rice, Pearce\u2019s companion case, the defendant pleaded guilty to four separate charges of second degree burglary and was sentenced to prison terms aggregating 10 years. The judgments were set aside 2\u00bd years later, in a coram nobis proceeding, on the ground that Rice had not been accorded his constitutional right to counsel. He was retried on three of the charges, convicted, and sentenced to prison terms aggregating 25 years, with no credit being given for the time he had spent in prison on the original sentence.\n.
