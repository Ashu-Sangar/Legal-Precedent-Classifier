{"id": "1736880", "contents": "OPINION\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nJulius Pugh was convicted by a jury of murder of the third degree. Post-verdict motions were denied and a prison sentence of ten to twenty years was imposed. This appeal followed.\nPugh contends he is entitled to a new trial because of certain alleged errors in the prosecution process. The Commonwealth argues these issues have not been preserved for appellate review because Pugh failed to comply with Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975), which requires that assignments of error be presented in written post-verdict motions. We do not accept the Commonwealth\u2019s position. The assignments of error were presented to the post-verdict motion court in a written \u201cMemorandum in Support of Motions in Arrest of Judgment or for New Trial,\u201d and the court accepted and considered the merit of these assignments of error without objection. Thus, while we do not approve of this practice, Commonwealth v. Grace, 473 Pa. 542, 375 A.2d 721 (1977), is controlling and we will consider the issues to be properly before us.\nPugh urges, inter alia, that the trial court erred in denying pretrial applications to suppress certain evidence which was later used against him at trial. Included in this category is evidence of oral and written statements Pugh is said to have made while in police custody. Specifically, Pugh maintains this evidence was obtained under impermissible circumstances, namely, without a prior knowing and intelligent waiver of constitutional rights and that the trial court erred in ruling otherwise. After an examination of the record we are unable to intelligently resolve the merits of this issue and will, for the reasons that follow, remand the record to the trial court for further proceedings.\nThe record discloses that the answers of the Commonwealth to the pretrial applications to suppress were not filed until the day fixed for the suppression hearing, a date well beyond the time permitted. Because of this, Pugh\u2019s counsel requested the suppression court to accept as true all well-pleaded facts in the applications. The request was denied for reasons not made clear. In overruling the post-verdict motions, the trial court stated the suppression court had \u201cdiscretion, under Rule of Criminal Procedure No. 20 to disregard the Commonwealth\u2019s technical failure to comply with the rules, if it believed the interests of justice so required.\u201d\nOur research has not disclosed any \u201cRule of Criminal Procedure No. 20\u201d justifying a disregard of Pa.R.Crim.P. 308(a)\u2019s mandate, and since there was nothing of record to show \u201cgood cause\u201d for the late filing of the answers, the suppression court should have accepted as true all of the well-pleaded facts averred in Pugh\u2019s applications. Commonwealth v. Eller, 232 Pa.Super. 99, 332 A.2d 507 (1974).\nThe Commonwealth argues that, even if the suppression court erred in not following the mandate of Rule 308, supra, no prejudice resulted because all of the well-pleaded facts in the applications were eventually accepted as true in the court\u2019s adjudication disposing of the applications to suppress. While this may be correct in part, it is not completely so.\nPugh\u2019s claim that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his constitutional rights before making the challenged statements was based in part on the allegation that on the day \u201cof the interrogation by the police, the defendant (Pugh) had taken an unknown quantity of prescriptive drugs.\u201d\nIn view of the untimely filing of the answers without \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d the suppression court was required to accept this factual averment in the applications as true. But this the suppression court failed to do. In fact, there is nothing in the court\u2019s findings or adjudication to indicate this fact was considered.\nWhile the intake of drugs does not necessarily prevent one from knowingly and intelligently waiving constitutional rights, Commonwealth v. Cornish, 471 Pa. 256, 370 A.2d 291 (1976), it may well do so. To determine this all of the attending circumstances must be considered, including the type and quantity of the drug, the exact time or times the drug was consumed and whether an impairment of the faculties ensued. The instant record fails to provide this information.\nWe will, therefore, vacate the judgment of sentence and remand the record to the trial court for a new suppression hearing at which all relevant facts and circumstances are to be explored and considered. Following this, if the Court again determines the challenged evidence was obtained under constitutionally permissible circumstances, it will reinstate the judgment of sentence and Pugh may file a new appeal. But if the Court determines the challenged evidence should have been suppressed, then a new trial should be granted.\nIt is so ordered.\nPOMEROY and NIX, JJ., filed dissenting opinions.\nJONES, former C. J., and ROBERTS, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. Pugh was ordered committed to a mental rehabilitation facility in lieu of incarceration in a correctional institution.\n. Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 308 provides:\n\u201cAnswers to Pretrial Application\n\u201c(a) Answers may be filed not later than seven days after service of the pretrial application, except for good cause shown. Failure to answer shall be deemed an admission of the well pleaded facts averred in the application.\u201d\n. The court did say the district attorney\u2019s office was experiencing difficulty with stenographic personnel. Even assuming such would constitute \u201cgood cause shown,\u201d there is nothing of record to support this.\n. Of course, a rule of procedure adopted by a court of common pleas cannot be used as a means to circumvent our rules of procedure. Pa.R.Crim.P. 1(b).\n. We reject the Commonwealth\u2019s position that Pugh was required to allege \u201cspecific prejudice resulting from the late filing.\u201d No such requirement is set forth in Pa.R.Crim.P. 308.\n. Additionally, Pugh alleged he was a functional illiterate and was suffering serious psychiatric problems and had consumed a quantity of alcohol immediately before his arrest and the questioning."}
