It must find facts and not the evidence. If the finding in this respect be defective a venire facias de novo will be awarded: Kinsley v. Coyle, 8 P. F. Smith 461. It cannot be pretended that this well settled rule is at all affected by the Act of April 22d 1874, Pamph. L. 109, passed in pursuance of art. V. \u00a7 27 of the Constitution. Noth the Constitution and the Act require that the agreement shall be in writing and filed; and the Act directs that the court shall find the facts separately and distinctly, with answers to any points submitted, and the conclusions of law, which shall also be filed.\nJudgment reversed and venire facias de novo awarded."}
