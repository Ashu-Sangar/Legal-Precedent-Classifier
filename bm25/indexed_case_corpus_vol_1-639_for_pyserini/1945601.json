{"id": "1945601", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Bobeets,\nAppellant Antonio Velasquez was tried by jury in Philadelphia in 1970 and found guilty of second degree murder. Post-trial motions were denied and a sentence of not less than ten nor more than twenty years imposed. Appellant in this direct appeal argues that the Commonwealth introduced notes of testimony of a witness from an earlier proceeding in contravention of the Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, \u00a73, 19 P.S. \u00a7582. We affirm.\nThe Act of 1887 permits the admission of notes of testimony of a prior proceeding of a witness now deceased if the defendant was present at the prior proceeding and had \u201can opportunity to examine or cross-examine\u201d the witness; and the issue at the two proceedings remains substantially the same. To properly apply the Act of 1887, it is necessary to review the records of the two proceedings to determine the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the nature of the defense, and the factual and legal issues actually in controversy. Only after such review can it be decided whether the issues in the two proceedings were substantially the same and the opportunity to cross-examine and the adequacy of the cross-examination conducted were sufficient to justify admission of the notes of testimony. Here such review of the record demonstrates beyond question that the issues in controversy were substantially the same.\nAt the first proceeding in 1965 appellant Velasquez entered a guilty plea. The Commonwealth sought to prove at the degree of guilt hearing that appellant, after a bitter argument with the deceased bartender Carlos Rodriquez, returned to the bar and repeatedly shot Rodriquez intentionally causing his death. One of the Commonwealth witnesses, Nathaniel Willingham, testified that he saw appellant approach the bar armed with a gun, enter the bar, and start shooting.\nAppellant\u2019s guilty plea was set aside and at appellant\u2019s subsequent jury trial the Commonwealth offered, over objection, the same evidence which had been introduced at the degree of guilt hearing\u2014inter alia, the testimony of Nathaniel Willingham, deceased at the time of trial. Appellant did not try to establish an alibi or contend that he was unarmed or that he did not fire any shots. Instead, appellant\u2019s evidence at trial was offered to negate the Commonwealth\u2019s proof of first degree murder\u2014precisely the same defense relied upon at the degree of guilt hearing.\nAppellant during the jury trial attempted to impeach Willingham\u2019s testimony at the degree of guilt hearing with the notes of Willingham\u2019s testimony given at an earlier preliminary hearing. Willingham testified at the preliminary hearing: \u201cVelasquez went in and I heard about three or four shots, so then Velasquez ran out, and Jamieson ran in, and he shot about three or four times, and he ran out.\u201d Later at the degree of guilt hearing Willingham gave the following additional testimony: \u201cI see Tony [appellant] leaning over the bar and he shot about four, five times. . .\nWillingham\u2019s testimony at both the degree of guilt hearing and the preliminary hearing established that appellant fired his gun in the bar and this was never disputed by appellant. The degree of guilt hearing testimony, indicating appellant fired his gun in the direction of the bartender\u2019s usual location behind the bar, provided, however, circumstantial proof of a premeditated and deliberate shooting.\nThe nature of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and appellant\u2019s defense at both the degree of guilt hearing and the subsequent trial supports the conclusion that both proceedings involved \u201csubstantially the same\u201d issues\u2014did appellant with premeditation and without provocation secure a gun and deliberately shoot the deceased with an intent to kill?\nThe cross-examination conducted by appellant\u2019s counsel at the degree of guilt hearing confirms the presence of opportunity and motive for adequate cross-examination and the fact that appellant\u2019s counsel properly utilized the opportunity. During the degree of guilt hearing appellant\u2019s counsel exploited the weakness of Willingham\u2019s direct examination by establishing that the witness never saw appellant shoot the deceased\u2014the witness only saw appellant firing a gun inside the bar. Appellant\u2019s counsel by proper cross-examination challenged the accuracy of the witness\u2019 testimony by demonstrating that the witness was outside the bar fifty feet away and had been drinking shortly before observing these events.\nCounsel was unable, however, to discredit the witness\u2019 damaging testimony that appellant approached the bar armed with a gun and fired shots in the direction of the bartender\u2019s usual position behind the bar. Damage to defendant which results from the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s case should not be confused with denial of opportunity and motive for full and effective cross-examination.\nThe record clearly demonstrates that the issues at the degree of guilt hearing and the subsequent trial were substantially the same, and that an opportunity and motive for full and effective cross-examination existed at the first criminal proceeding. The Act of 1887 is satisfied and the notes of testimony properly admitted.\nAppellant originally pled guilty to murder generally in 1965 and after a degree of guilt hearing was found guilty of first degree murder and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed. During that degree of guilt hearing the testimony at issue was introduced. In Commonwealth v. Velasquez, 437 Pa. 262, 263 A. 2d 351 (1970), we vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded for a new trial.\nThe Act of 1887 reads in pertinent part: \u201cWhenever any person has been examined as a witness, either for the Commonwealth or for the defense, in any criminal proceeding conducted in or before a court of record, and the defendant has been present and has had an opportunity to examine or cross-examine, if such witness afterwards dies, . . . notes of his examination shall be competent evidence upon a subsequent trial of the same criminal issue. . . .\u201d\nAppellant challenges the admissibility of testimony introduced at the 1965 degree of guilt hearing on the basis of the Act of 1887 and has not raised a constitutional challenge based on the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.\nThe requirement that the issue remain the \u201csame\u201d in both proceedings is designed to insure that the defendant had the opportunity for full and effective cross-examination in the first proceeding. This requirement is in accord with the common law rule that \u201cthe issues in the first proceeding and hence the purpose for which the testimony was there offered, must have been such that the present opponent (or some person in like interest) had an adequate motive for testing on cross-examination the credibility of the testimony now offered.\u201d McCormick, Evidence \u00a7234 at 491 (1954) ; 5 Wigmore, \u00a7\u00a71388-88 (3d ed. 1940) ; Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and Magistrates, \u00a7804(b)(1) (Revised Draft, March, 1971) (see also accompanying commentary) ; see 1 Henry, Pennsylvania Evidence \u00a7\u00a7482-83 (1953) ; 2 Wharton, Criminal Evidence \u00a7484 (1955).\nIn Commonwealth v. Clarkson, 438 Pa. 523, 265 A. 2d 802 (1970), we held that notes of testimony of a preliminary hearing were properly admissible. Clarkson, however, did not rely on the Act of 1887. A preliminary hearing is not conducted before a \u201ccourt of record\u201d as is required by the Act of 1887. Commonwealth v. Lenousky, 206 Pa. 277, 55 Atl. 977 (1903). Instead in Clarkson, we relied upon prior case law independent of the act which permitted the use of testimony from a preliminary hearing at a subsequent trial. See Commonwealth v. Ryhal, 274 Pa. 401, 118 Atl. 358 (1922) ; Commonwealth v. Keck, 148 Pa. 639, 24 Atl. 161 (1892) ; Commonwealth v. Miller, 203 Pa. Superior Ct. 511, 201 A. 2d 256 (1964).\nAppellant also tried to introduce the testimony of a witness who would summarize the accounts of two eyewitnesses who were unavailable at time of trial. This testimony was offered to establish that the deceased bartender was drunk and may have provoked appellant. This offer of proof was rejected as inadmissible hearsay.\nHindsight might suggest that the only flaw in this cross-examination at the degree of guilt hearing was the failure to impeach Willingham with his testimony at the preliminary hearing to reveal an inconsistency. At the degree of guilt hearing Willingham testified he saw appellant shooting the gun in the bar while at the preliminary hearing he only claimed he heard, shots fired. This may or may not be a weakness in the cross-examination. It is conceivable that defense counsel was unwilling to take a chance on the witness\u2019 ability to explain away his preliminary hearing testimony. As trial strategy such a decision is not subject to effective challenge. See Commonwealth v. McGrogan, 449 Pa. 584, 297 A. 2d 456 (1972). If the failure to explore this matter on cross-examination be regarded as a flaw it is indeed an insignificant one since appellant in rebuttal during the jury trial offered in evidence Willingham\u2019s preliminary hearing statement for impeachment purposes."}
