{"id": "882169", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis is a proper cas'e for restitution. It might properly have been awarded by the court below, as the judgment was collected after the appeal to this court was taken and did not regularly appear as part of the record here. Having been brought to our attention however by petition and motion, we now have no hesitation in saying that a writ of restitution should issue out of the court below.\nThe writ is awarded."}
