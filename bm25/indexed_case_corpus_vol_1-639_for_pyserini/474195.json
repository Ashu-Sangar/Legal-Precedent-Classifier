{"id": "474195", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nThe Superior Court remanded this case for an evidentiaryhearing on Respondent\u2019s claim, raised in his second petition for collateral relief, that his counsel for his first petition for collateral relief was ineffective for \u201cabandoning\u201d him following the court\u2019s reinstatement of this right to appeal nunc pro tunc pursuant to his first petition for collateral relief, 435 Pa.Super. 642, 645 A.2d 886. Respondent\u2019s second petition for collateral relief; however, afforded Respondent the opportunity to raise all issues that could have been raised by way of direct appeal, and both the Common Pleas Court and Superior Court reviewed and disposed of these claims on the merits. Even if counsel was \u201cineffective\u201d for not pursuing the direct appeal, the Respondent ultimately obtained review of the claims he asserts counsel should have pursued, therefore he can demonstrate no prejudice. Thus, no evidentiary hearing is necessary.\nAccordingly, the Commonwealth\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED. The Order of the Superior Court remanding the case for an evidentiary hearing is REVERSED.\nCAPPY, J., dissents.\nMONTEMURO, J., is sitting by designation."}
