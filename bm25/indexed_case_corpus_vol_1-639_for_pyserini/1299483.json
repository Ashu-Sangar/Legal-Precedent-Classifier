{"id": "1299483", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Bell,\nPlaintiff sued Maseiantonio, the driver, and Joseph Mascaro and Leon J. Mascaro, his employers, for personal injuries and property damage resulting from a collision between plaintiff\u2019s automobile and defendant\u2019s dump truck. All the defendants admitted liability and the only real question involved at the trial was the question of damages. The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff in the sum of $10,000 against Joseph Mascaro and Leon J. Mascaro, but made no mention of defendant Masciantonio, the driver. Defendants filed a motion for a new trial and for judgment n.o.v. The lower Court dismissed defendants\u2019 motion for judgment n.o.v. However, tbe Court, speaking through the trial Judge, stated that \u201cthe verdict was so excessive that it shocked the Court\u2019s conscience\u201d and granted defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial unless plaintiff within 20 days filed a remittitur of record in the amount of $5,000. Plaintiff refused-to file the remittitur and instead appealed to this Court from the Order granting a new trial.\nThe trial Judge\u2019s charge that the jury could find a verdict exculpating the driver of defendant\u2019s truck but holding the owners of the truck liable for the driver\u2019s negligence, constituted basic fundamental and prejudicial error: Matkevich v. Robertson, 403 Pa. 200, 169 A. 2d 91. The jury\u2019s verdict which, in effect, did just that, was capricious and against the evidence and the law, and not only justified but necessitated a new trial.\nOrder affirmed."}
