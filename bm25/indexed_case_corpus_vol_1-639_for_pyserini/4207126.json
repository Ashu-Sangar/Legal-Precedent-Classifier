{"id": "4207126", "contents": "OPINION\nChief Justice CASTILLE.\nThis Court reviews the direct appeal of appellant Andre Staton from the sentence of death imposed on June 1, 2006, following a jury trial before the Honorable Elizabeth Doyle of the Blair County Court of Common Pleas. Appellant raises a single claim of error related to the penalty phase of his trial. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the conviction and judgment of sentence.\nAppellant was charged with a single count of criminal homicide, two counts of aggravated assault, and one count each of burglary, criminal trespass, receiving stolen property, and theft by unlawful taking, in connection with the stabbing death of Beverly Yohn. The Commonwealth issued a notice to appellant that it would be seeking the death penalty based on the aggravating factors that the killing occurred while in the perpetration of a felony (criminal trespass), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6), and at the time of the killing, appellant was subject to a court order restricting his behavior towards the victim, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(18).\nAt trial, the Commonwealth established that appellant began dating Beverly Yohn in the Spring or Summer of 2003. In the Fall of 2003, one of Ms. Yohn\u2019s friends observed injuries to Ms. Yohn. In late January of 2004, Ms. Yohn called the police alleging that appellant had struck her. After the incident, Ms. Yohn filed a Protection From Abuse (\u201cPFA\u201d) petition against appellant and on January 27, 2004 a temporary PFA order was entered against him. Subsequently, a PFA hearing was held on February 19, 2004 (before Judge Doyle). At the conclusion of the hearing, a final PFA order was entered against appellant.\nOn February 24, 2004, appellant was at the 10th Street Caf\u00e9, a bar in Altoona at 6 p.m. He left and returned there at 9 p.m. where he drank for two hours and talked to Lynn McDonough, the bartender, about \u201chis girlfriend.\u201d He said he had peeked in her windows the night before. Appellant also told the bartender that he gave Ms. Yohn \u201cforty thousand dollars ($40,000) for a house and now he can\u2019t live in the house,\u201d but stated it \u201cwill be taken care of.\u201d N.T., 4/27/2006, at 134-136.\nOn the morning of February 25, 2004, at 6:40 a.m., appellant was observed in a parked car in front of 212 Third Street, Altoona, approximately a block and a half from Ms. Yohn\u2019s mother\u2019s residence, located at 228 Third Avenue. At that time Ms. Yohn was staying at her mother\u2019s residence with her three sons. Ms. Yohn\u2019s son, Justin, was outside the residence starting a car in order for his mother to drive him to school. Penny Lantz, Justin\u2019s grandmother, had earlier left the house for work. Justin saw appellant run up to the residence. Appellant put his finger to his lips, indicating that Justin was to be quiet. Appellant then entered a rear porch and kicked in the back door. Justin saw appellant come out a short time later, whereupon appellant threw Justin from the car and drove away in it. N.T., 4/28/2006, at 108-118.\nMeanwhile, Jeremy Yohn, another son of the victim, was in the kitchen. Jeremy saw his mother lock the back door and, shortly thereafter, saw appellant kick in the back door and enter the kitchen. Jeremy testified that appellant opened his jacket and pulled out a knife with his left hand. Immediately after pulling out the knife, appellant began stabbing Ms. Yohn until she fell to the floor. Appellant then left the residence through the back door. N.T., 4/28/2006, at 146-159.\nMs. Yohn was taken to the Altoona Hospital Trauma Center with a large knife still protruding from her back. She was later pronounced dead that day. Dr. Vimal Mittal testified at trial as an expert witness in forensic pathology and that, in his opinion within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the cause of Ms. Yohn\u2019s death was multiple stab wounds to the heart and left jugular vein, with cardiac tamponade, and that the manner of her death was homicide. N.T., 4/27/2006, at 122-127.\nAppellant testified at trial. He admitted that he stabbed Ms. Yohn, and caused her death, but denied that he had gone to the residence with the intent to harm her. Instead, he claimed that it was Ms. Yohn who had the knife in her hand and began \u201cswinging at him\u201d; the next thing he remembered was seeing Ms. Yohn with blood coming out of her mouth. N.T., 5/1/2006, at 26-29.\nOn May 2, 2006, a jury convicted appellant of all charges, including first-degree murder. Following the penalty phase of trial, the jury found both aggravating circumstances and found four mitigating circumstances under the \u201ccatchall\u201d mitigator at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8) \u2014 appellant\u2019s childhood circumstances, his polysubstance abuse, his medical history, and his potential for good. The jury further found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and returned a sentence of death. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv). The sentence of death was formally imposed by Judge Doyle on June 1, 2006. The trial court sentenced appellant further to forty-eight to ninety-six months of imprisonment for burglary and a consecutive term of twelve to twenty-four months for theft by unlawful taking.\nAppellant filed post-sentence motions which were denied by opinion and order dated June 25, 2007. Appellant filed this direct appeal to this Court on July 24, 2007. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h). On appeal, appellant raises a single issue:\nWhether the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time of the killing [appellant] was subject to a court order restricting his behavior towards the Victim pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(18).\nSee Brief for Appellant at 5.\nI. Sufficiency of the Evidence\nAlthough appellant does not raise a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction for first-degree murder, this Court sua sponte reviews the evidence in all capital cases to ensure that the evidence is sufficient to support the first-degree murder conviction, whether or not sufficiency is challenged by the appellant. Commonwealth v. Sanchez, 614 Pa. 1, 36 A.3d 24, 37-38 (2011).\nIn considering the sufficiency of the evidence for a first-degree murder conviction, this Court must ascertain whether the evidence introduced at trial and all reasonable inferences derived from that evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, is sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the elements of first-degree murder. Our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Id.\nFirst-degree murder is an intentional killing, ie., a \u201cwillful, deliberate and premeditated killing.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a), (d). In order to prove first-degree murder, the Commonwealth must establish that: (1) a human being was killed; (2) the accused caused the death; and (3) the accused acted with malice and specific intent to kill. The jury may infer the intent to kill based upon the accused\u2019s use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim\u2019s body. Sanchez, 36 A.3d at 37 (citing 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2501(a), 2502(a), (d) and related case law).\nThere is no doubt that Ms. Yohn was killed and that appellant caused her death. The murder was witnessed by Ms. Yohn\u2019s son Jeremy; at trial, appellant admitted to stabbing Ms. Yohn; and the Commonwealth\u2019s forensic expert testified that her death resulted from the stabbing and that the manner of her death was homicide. N.T., 4/27/2006, at 127. Thus, the only remaining question is whether the evidence was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant acted with malice and specific intent to kill.\nJeremy Yohn testified that he saw appellant pull a knife from his coat, a fact that supports an inference that appellant went to the residence with the intent to harm Ms. Yohn, which is precisely what he did, as Jeremy bore witness to seeing appellant stab his mother multiple times. A DNA expert testified that a broken knife handle found in the kitchen contained a mixture of Ms. Yohn\u2019s and appellant\u2019s DNA. N.T., 4/29/06, 124-26. When Ms. Yohn was taken to the hospital, a large knife was still protruding from her back. The forensic expert called by the Commonwealth testified that Ms. Yohn was stabbed in the heart and the left jugular vein, causing her death. Based on the circumstances surrounding this killing, including appellant\u2019s uninvited entry into the victim\u2019s home while armed with a deadly weapon, which he proceeded to use multiple times on the victim, the jury was fully warranted in concluding that the killing was with malice and with the specific intent to kill. The record supports appellant\u2019s conviction for first-degree murder.\nII. Jfi Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(18)\nThe only issue raised by appellant relates to the penalty phase of his trial and contests whether the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstance that at the time of the killing appellant was subject to a court order restricting his behavior towards the victim, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(18).\nAppellant challenged the Commonwealth\u2019s use of the (d)(18) aggravator pre-trial and the trial court held a hearing on the question. At the hearing, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Deborah Moeller and Timothy Case, both friends of Ms. Yohn. The trial court did not rule immediately on the question, but delayed deciding the issue until the penalty phase of the trial \u201cif it ever comes to that.\u201d See N.T., 3/31/2006, at 30. Following completion of the guilt phase and the jury\u2019s first-degree murder verdict, the trial court announced that it had considered the standard set forth in Commonwealth v. Stallworth, 566 Pa. 349, 781 A.2d 110 (2001), and concluded that the (d)(18) aggravator could be submitted to the jury. N.T., 5/2/2006, at 95. Appellant renews his argument on appeal to this Court.\nThe genesis of appellant\u2019s argument is this Court\u2019s decision in Stallworth, which held that the subsection (d)(18) aggravator applied only where the Commonwealth proves that the defendant had \u201cactual notice or ha[d] the equivalent knowledge of a PFA order so as to be \u2018subject to\u2019 such an order.\u201d Stallworth, 781 A.2d at 124. Appellant also cites Commonwealth v. Padilla, 885 A.2d 994 (Pa.Super.2005), a decision from the Superior Court defining circumstances when the defendant could be deemed to have equivalent knowledge of a PFA \u201ceven in the absence of personal service.\u201d Id. at 996.\nRelying upon these two cases, appellant avers that he was not notified of the final PFA order and that he was under the reasonable belief that Ms. Yohn had withdrawn her petition at the final PFA hearing. In appellant\u2019s view, the evidence was insufficient to create a jury question concerning his knowledge of the PFA. In support of his argument, appellant cites the following testimony from trial.\nAppellant notes that he entered into a stipulation at trial as follows: a temporary PFA was entered against him on January 27, 2004; a judge held a hearing on February 19, 2004 related to the entry of a final PFA order; at the conclusion of that hearing a final PFA order was entered; and there was no court order rescinding, vacating, or modifying the PFA order. The stipulation further provided \u201cthere is no physical evidence in the record that any of the three above-mentioned documents were personally served on [appellant]. However, the record reflects unsuccessful attempts at said service.\u201d N.T., 5/1/2006, at 2-3.\nAccording to appellant, the transcript of the February 19, 2004 PFA hearing reflects that he did not attend the hearing and Ms. Yohn indicated that she did not think he had notice of the hearing. N.T., 2/19/2004, at 1 (PFA hearing). He further alleges that he understood that Ms. Yohn was going to withdraw the petition. Appellant points out that the transcript of the hearing reflects that Ms. Yohn stated that she wanted to withdraw the PFA petition. However, appellant acknowledges that she did not withdraw the petition and the order remained in full force and effect.\nAppellant also cites the trial testimony of Ms. Yohn\u2019s friend, Deborah Moeller, who explained that she took Ms. Yohn to talk to appellant after the PFA order had been entered and further stated that she did not know whether Ms. Yohn and appellant were still living together. Ms. Moeller testified that Ms. Yohn told Moeller that she informed appellant about filing the PFA petition, but never told him about the PFA order.\nAppellant also references the testimony of the police officer who responded to a domestic disturbance call placed by Ms. Yohn on January 26, 2004, the day before she obtained the temporary PFA order. Appellant focuses on the officer\u2019s statement that appellant was angry at being asked to leave his house. On cross-examination, the officer admitted he made no effort to determine who owned the house and further testified that \u201cthere wasn\u2019t any court order or anything actually that legally prevented\u201d appellant from contacting Ms. Yohn at that time. N.T., 4/27/2006, at 90-91.\nAppellant next summarizes the testimony of Lynn McDonough, the bartender at the 10th Street Caf\u00e9, who had spoken with appellant the night before the murder. Ms. McDonough testified that appellant told her that he had given his girlfriend $40,000 to buy a house that he \u201ccan\u2019t live in.\u201d N.T., 4/27/2006, at 136.\nAppellant also cites the testimony of Ms. Yohn\u2019s mother, Penny Lantz, who testified that Ms. Yohn had been living with her for five days before the murder. Before that, Ms. Yohn had been staying at the First Avenue residence and that she had moved because of her fear of appellant. Ms. Lantz testified to seeing appellant on her back porch two nights before the murder. She stated that she picked up the phone and pretended to be dialing the police, at which point appellant fled. However, Lantz did not call the police because \u201cBeverly did not want Andre to go to jail.\u201d N.T., 4/28/2006, at 61. On cross-examination, Ms. Lantz stated that Ms. Yohn tried to withdraw the PFA petition.\nAppellant also details the testimony of Michael Skinner, Ms. Yohn\u2019s former boyfriend, prior to appellant. Appellant claimed that he saw Mr. Skinner leaving Ms. Lantz\u2019s house when he was driving by the house the night before the murder. Mr. Skinner, however, denied being at the house. On cross-examination, Mr. Skinner stated that he told the police that Ms. Yohn had a PFA order against appellant, but testified that he believed appellant had not been served with the PFA. Mr. Skinner also testified that he spoke with Ms. Yohn on the day of her murder because she was having problems in her relationship with appellant.\nFinally, appellant notes his own testimony at trial, pointing out that he was living with Ms. Yohn and her three children until February 22, 2004. Appellant testified that he was depressed and was self-medicating with drugs and alcohol. Further, appellant admitted that Ms. Yohn told him about the PFA, but he claimed he did not know what it meant:\nShe mentioned something about a PFA but never said anything about a PFA where you couldn\u2019t be around her. I did not know the definition of PFA because I had never heard of such ... that\u2019s not what they have in Maryland, it\u2019s not called a PFA, so I had no idea what a PFA was and she mentioned that she was going to get a PFA but I didn\u2019t question her so I had no idea exactly what exactly it was.\u201d\nN.T., 5/1/2006, at 17. Appellant further claimed that Ms. Yohn met him two nights before the murder and that they began to \u201cmake out in the car.\u201d Appellant also denied contacting Dorothy Winfield or discussing the PFA with the bartender of the 10th Street Caf\u00e9. Appellant testified that Ms. Yohn told him that the PFA hearing was discontinued.\nAppellant also acknowledges that the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Winfield to rebut his testimony that he was unaware of the PFA order. Ms. Winfield testified that an individual identifying himself as \u201cAndre Staton\u201d called her on February 17, 2004, asking whether he needed to attend a PFA hearing. She testified that she told the caller that he could lose all of his rights if he did not attend the hearing. Winfield stated that the caller told her that the victim was going to withdraw the petition, but Winfield explained that it was up to the court whether to accept the withdrawal. Ms. Winfield stated that she did not remember if she told the caller the date or time of the hearing. On cross-examination, she admitted that on her report of the phone call, she had written \u201cnew hearing date, February 26, 2004.\u201d N.T., 5/1/2006, 62-68.\nFinally, appellant references the penalty phase testimony of Timothy Case, Ms. Yohn\u2019s friend, regarding a call Case placed to appellant on February 5, 2004. Mr. Case further testified that he told Ms. Yohn to tell appellant that she had a PFA order against him as follows:\nBev was reluctant to call Andre to inform him about the PFA and I kept telling her you have to let him know that this has been filed so I dialed the number. Andre answered the phone. I said Andre [sic] Bev needs to talk you [sic]. I gave Bev the phone. She said Andre I filed a PFA. She hung the phone up, that was the end of the conversation.\nN.T., 5/3/2006, at 30.\nAppellant claims that the above testimony demonstrates that he was unaware of the outcome of the February 19, 2004 hearing and he believed that the PFA was withdrawn at the hearing. Appellant notes that all of the attempts to serve him with the PFA occurred prior to the February 19th hearing, and that Ms. Yohn told him that the proceeding was discontinued. Appellant claims that the above evidence merely establishes that he was given notice of the order prior to the February 19th hearing. Appellant further contends that the evidence showed that he continued to meet and/or speak with Ms. Yohn. According to appellant, the fact that Ms. Yohn moved in with her mother after the final PFA order was entered does not prove that he knew of the final PFA order; nor does the fact that he was looking into the windows at Ms. Lantz\u2019s residence establish that he knew of the final PFA order. Likewise, appellant avers that Ms. McDonough\u2019s testimony was consistent with the fact that he was removed from their house on January 26, 2004 (during the domestic disturbance call), rather than being removed by court order. Instead, according to appellant, he continued to live in the First Avenue house and was never told to leave it. In conclusion, appellant avers that the facts show that he was never served with the final PFA order, and that he did not have \u201canecdotal knowledge of the order \u2018restricting in any way his behavior towards the victim,\u2019 \u201d citing Stallworth, 781 A.2d at 126. Accordingly, appellant argues that the jury\u2019s finding of the (d)(18) aggravator was unsupported by the evidence, and he is entitled to a new penalty phase hearing, since there were mitigating factors found by the jury, and because of this the improper aggravator affected the jury\u2019s penalty verdict.\nThe Commonwealth has filed a brief response. The Commonwealth recounts much of the same testimony set forth by appellant, but draws a different conclusion from that testimony. The Commonwealth asserts that the evidence showed that appellant knew that Ms. Yohn had obtained a PFA order against him, since she told him on two separate occasions that she had done so, citing the testimony of Case and Moeller. The Commonwealth also points to the fact that appellant admitted that he hid from the Sheriff, who was attempting to serve him with the PFA order. Furthermore, the Commonwealth looks to Ms. Winfield\u2019s testimony as evidence that appellant knew there was an order against him. Winfield\u2019s testimony also demonstrated that appellant was told that the PFA court could refuse to withdraw the order irrespective of Ms. Yohn\u2019s wishes. The Commonwealth avers that appellant\u2019s conduct in fleeing from Ms. Lantz\u2019s porch when she pretended to call the police was guilty conduct reflecting that appellant knew there was a PFA order against him. Finally, the Commonwealth points to the testimony of Ms. McDonough, the bartender of the 10th Street Caf\u00e9, as evidence that appellant knew of the PFA order.\nThe Commonwealth also contends that the jury properly could conclude that appellant\u2019s self-serving testimony, that he believed that Ms. Yohn was going to withdraw the PFA order, was incredible since it was unsupported by other evidence. For all of these reasons, the Commonwealth concludes that the evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, established beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had knowledge of the existence of the PFA order at the time he murdered Ms. Yohn.\nThe trial court concluded that the testimony elicited from the witnesses at trial, in particular that of Ms. Winfield, established that appellant knew of the PFA order. The trial court also found that the jury was free to reject appellant\u2019s testimony as incredible in relation to the totality of the evidence. Accordingly, the trial court rejected appellant\u2019s argument related to the (d)(18) aggravator. See Trial Court Opinion, 6/25/2007, at 16-17.\nThe death penalty statute enumerates a list of aggravating circumstances that can be presented to a jury and, when pursued, must be proven by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iii), (d). Subsection 9711(d)(18) provides an aggravating circumstance where a defendant is subject to a PFA order, as follows:\nAt the time of the killing the defendant was subject to a court order restricting in any way the defendant\u2019s behavior toward the victim pursuant to 23 Pa.C.S. Ch. 61 (relating to protection from abuse) or any other order of a court of common pleas or of the minor judiciary designed in whole or in part to protect the victim from the defendant.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(18).\nIn Stallworth, this Court was called upon to interpret the language of subsection (d)(18) and determine whether the phrase \u201csubject to\u201d in subsection (d)(18) required proof that the defendant had actual knowledge of the PFA order in order for the aggravator to apply. This Court found that the phrase was not clear and free from ambiguity, but was capable of several different meanings. In resolving the ambiguity, we noted that penal statutes are to be strictly construed, and, in circumstances involving a sentence of death, \u201cstrict construction should militate in favor of the least inclusive interpretation.\u201d Stallworth, 781 A.2d at 124 (citation omitted). Therefore, we concluded that subsection (d)(18) required a defendant \u201ceither be given actual notice or have the equivalent knowledge of a PFA order\u201d in order to be \u201csubject to\u201d the aggravator. Id.\nThe Stallworth Court then applied this standard to the facts before it to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to present the aggravator during the penalty phase to the jury. We found that, even though Stallworth had knowledge that the victim had obtained some type of court order restricting his rights regarding his daughter, the evidence did not show that Stallworth understood that the order related to protection of the victim. Rather, the testimony at trial tended to establish that Stallworth believed the victim had obtained a court order that restricted access to his daughter. Accordingly, \u201cbecause Appellant was never served with notice of the PFA order, which had only been issued fewer than twenty-four hours before the killing, and because he did not have anecdotal knowledge[] of the existence of an order ... he was not \u2018subject to\u2019 such order for purposes of the aggravating circumstance set forth at 9711(d)(18).\u201d Id. at 126. We remanded for a new penalty phase hearing.\nThis Court has not had the occasion to revisit or further construe the Stallworth holding, but the Superior Court employed the Stallworth Court\u2019s analysis in a different context in Padilla, supra. The question presented in Padilla was whether a telephone conversation with a police officer was adequate to convey notice that a PFA order had been entered against a defendant for purposes of a conviction for indirect criminal contempt. Analogizing the situation to Stallworth, the Superior Court concluded that the conversation, during which the defendant was informed of the order and the repercussions of violating it, were sufficient under Stallworth as constituting actual notice or its equivalent, even in the absence of personal service of the actual order. Padilla, 885 A.2d at 997.\nTurning to the instant case, there is no dispute that appellant was never served formally with the temporary or final PFA orders. However, the evidence demonstrated that the sheriff attempted to serve appellant with the temporary PFA order, but appellant avoided that service. The question in this case is whether there was sufficient evidence that appellant had the equivalent knowledge or anecdotal knowledge of the PFA order to raise a jury question as to proof of the aggravator. In our view, the evidence, summarized above, clearly supported a jury finding that appellant had the equivalent knowledge or anecdotal knowledge of the temporary PFA order. In any case, civil or criminal, party admissions or confessions are not required to establish necessary facts. Evidence of conduct, circumstantial evidence, and logical inferences may suffice to prove certain facts.\nIn this case, the evidence demonstrated that appellant deliberately avoided the authorities, who were attempting to serve him with the order. Moreover, two witnesses testified that Ms. Yohn specifically told appellant of the order, and the conversation between Ms. Winfield and a person identifying himself as appellant supported a jury finding that appellant had some knowledge of the order. Finally, appellant\u2019s conduct when the victim\u2019s mother feigned calling the police corroborated his knowledge, or the jury could so find. Appellant was free to forward his claim of studied ignorance, but the jury was not required to accept it; and appellant\u2019s demeanor and credibility in forwarding his claim, which the jury could assess (and an appellate court cannot recreate or second-guess), properly could factor into its conclusion. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to establish that appellant had equivalent knowledge of the PFA order.\nHowever, this is not the end of the inquiry, since appellant takes his argument one step farther, and asks this Court to parse out a distinction between the temporary and the final PFA order based on his self-serving testimony at trial \u2014 that he believed that the temporary PFA order was withdrawn; that Ms. Yohn told him the PFA proceedings were discontinued; and that he did not know a final order was ever entered. Although appellant sets forth his argument in terms of a question of law under Stallworth, nothing in Stallworth supports such a distinction, nor are we inclined to craft one. Instead, Stallworth set forth the legal standard as simply being whether the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had actual knowledge or its equivalent of the PFA order and then applied that standard to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to present the (d)(18) aggravator to the jury. As found by the trial court below, appellant\u2019s argument here is really a challenge to the weight the jury gave his testimony regarding his belief that no final PFA order had been entered. Appellant would like this Court to credit his testimony over the testimony of the other witnesses. This is not our duty, nor is it within our prerogative. See Sanchez, 36 A.3d at 39 (\u201cThe finder of fact \u2014 here, the jury \u2014 exclusively weighs the evidence, assesses the credibility of witnesses, and may choose to believe all, part, or none of the evidence.\u201d).\nWe recognize that the transcript of the February 19th PFA hearing provides some foundation for appellant\u2019s testimony, since Ms. Yohn initially attempted to withdraw the petition on that date. But, the jury was provided with the transcript of the hearing and heard testimony provided by appellant and other -witnesses. As the finder of fact, the jury was free to believe all, some, or none of appellant\u2019s testimony. Sanchez, supra. Accordingly, we do not find that Stallworth precluded the Commonwealth from presenting the (d)(18) aggravator for the jury\u2019s consideration, as a matter of law, and the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the jury to consider to this aggravator was not erroneous.\nIII. Statutory Review\nHaving rejected appellant\u2019s claim for relief, we now turn to the independent penalty review mandated by statute, 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3). Section 9711(h)(3) provides that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court shall affirm the sentence of death unless it determines that: (i) the sentence of death was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor; or (ii) the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d).\u201d Our review of the record reveals that the sentence of death in this case was not the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor, but was based upon the record. In addition, the evidence presented was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of the aggravating circumstances of murder committed during the perpetration of a felony (criminal trespass), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6), and at the time of the killing, appellant was subject to a court order restricting his behavior towards the victim, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(18). Accordingly, we will not disturb the sentence of death.\nFor these reasons, appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence is affirmed.\nJustices SAYLOR, EAKIN, BAER, TODD, McCAFFERY and ORIE MELVIN join the opinion.\n. The Commonwealth initially indicated that it was also pursuing the aggravating circumstance that the offense was committed by means of torture, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(8). The Commonwealth withdrew this aggravator prior to trial.\n. Cardiac tamponade was described at trial as \"bleeding to the heart.\u201d N.T., 4/27/2006, at 127.\n. The trial court originally sentenced appellant on the aggravated assault and criminal trespass counts, but later determined the sentences merged after considering the arguments by trial counsel. The above reflects the final sentencing court order, which was entered on June 5, 2006.\n. The delay in this matter was occasioned by the numerous prior appellate counsel, who were appointed to represent appellant, but later withdrew or were removed by court order. Appellant\u2019s current counsel, Thomas Farrell, Esquire, is appellant\u2019s seventh appellate counsel in this matter, see Commonwealth v. Staton (\"Staton I \u201d), 608 Pa. 404, 12 A.3d 277, 277-78 and n. 1 (2010).\nThe issue before this Court in Staton I involved Attorney Farrell's Motion to Withdraw based on his allegation that appellant had sent correspondence to him \"terminating\u201d his representation. Mr. Farrell believed that appellant\u2019s correspondence created an obligation to move to withdraw, but further recommended that we not grant appellant's request. We denied counsel\u2019s request to withdraw under Commonwealth v. Rogers, 537 Pa. 581, 645 A.2d 223, 224 (1994), and directed him to file his direct appeal brief, which is now the subject of this appeal.\n. The trial court issued an order dated April 12, 2006, stating that \"[a]ny remaining issue contained in the Defendant\u2019s Omnibus Pre-trial Motion for Continuance or supplemental Motion in Limine is denied and dismissed.\" However, it is unclear whether the trial court meant to dispose of the subsection (d)(18) issue by the April 12, 2006 order, since it definitively addressed it on the day before the penalty phase was to begin, as set forth herein.\n. The First Avenue residence is where Ms. Yohn and appellant resided together before the PFA was issued.\n. Ms. Yohn\u2019s third son, Jordan, who was six-years old at the time of her murder, did not testify at trial.\n. Dorothy Winfield was employed by Family Service Incorporated at the PFA Office in the Blair County Courthouse.\n. The Stallworth Court referred to \"equivalent knowledge\u201d and \"anecdotal knowledge\u201d interchangeably.\n. Our decision in Stallworth was not unanimous. Mr. Justice Saylor, joined by Mr. Justice Nigro, filed a concurring and dissenting opinion. On this issue, Justice Saylor noted that he would have found that the evidence was sufficient to present a jury question regarding the existence of the aggravator.\n. The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court is directed to transmit a complete record of this case to the Governor in accordance with 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 971 l(i)."}
