{"id": "1061560", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe right of the Borough of Shamokin to recover in this issue depended upon proof of title acquired by dedication of the land in dispute and the borough\u2019s acceptance of the dedication. The sole question submitted to the jury was as to such acquisition of title by the borough, and the finding was that it did not have title. We have discovered nothing in the twenty-five assignments of error calling for a submission of the same question, to another jury.\nJudgment affirmed."}
