{"id": "12278196", "contents": "OPINION\nJUSTICE DOUGHERTY\nWe granted discretionary review to consider whether an attorney who has been suspended from the practice of law by this Court may represent a claimant in unemployment compensation proceedings. A divided three-judge panel of the Commonwealth Court determined the claimant is entitled to his choice of representative, even if that representative is a suspended attorney, and remanded for a new hearing. We affirm the decision to remand, but reverse the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding that a suspended attorney may represent claimants in unemployment compensation proceedings.\nThis case arises from the unemployment compensation claim filed by appellee Gary H. Powell. The Unemployment Compensation Service Center determined appellee was ineligible to receive benefits pursuant to Section 402(b) of the Unemployment Compensation Law (the UC Law) because he voluntarily quit his job with Joe Krentzman & Sons (employer), without \u201ccause of a necessitous and compelling nature.\u201d See 43 P.S. \u00a7 802(b) (employee ineligible for compensation when unemployment is due to voluntarily leaving work without cause of necessitous and compelling nature). Appellee challenged the finding and referee Brian L. Parr scheduled a hearing to review appellee\u2019s claim. Appellee arrived at the hearing on December 5, 2013, with Donald A. Bailey, who stated he was present as appellee\u2019s pro bono advocate. Bailey admitted he was suspended from practicing law, by order of this Court dated October 2, 2013, for a period of five years. Original Record (O.R.) at Item 12, Notes of Testimony (N.T.) 12/5/13 at 1. Referee Parr allowed Bailey to participate in the hearing, which proceeded until Parr continued the matter to allow service of subpoenas on necessary fact witnesses.\nPrior to further proceedings on appellee\u2019s claim, however, employer, which had been previously acting pro se, obtained counsel. Employer\u2019s counsel promptly objected to Bailey\u2019s participation, asserting Pennsylvania Rule of Disciplinary Enforcement 217(j)(4)(vii), Pa.R.D.E. 217(j)(4)(vii), prohibits a suspended attorney from appearing in any hearing or proceeding before a referee. Bailey was given the opportunity to rebut employer\u2019s argument that Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217 prohibited his participation and he did so by letter, directing employer\u2019s attorney to review the language of the notice of hearing sent to each party, which expressly advised appellee he could \u201crepresent [himjself or [he] may be represented by an attorney or any other advocate of [his] choice.\u201d O.R. at Items 7, 14. See also Section 214 of the UC Law, 43 P.S. \u00a7 774 (\u201cAny party in any proceeding under this act before the department, a referee or the board may be represented by an attorney or other representative.\u201d).\nAfter consulting with Unemployment Compensation Board of Review (UCBR) counsel, newly assigned referee Susan G. Hess, by letter dated February 6, 2014, informed Bailey he would not be allowed to represent appellee and directed Bailey to notify appellee he could engage other representation. O.R. at Item 22. Referee Hess then conducted further proceedings on March 26, 2014, which appellee attended with Andrew J. Ostrowski. Referee Hess determined through questioning that Ostrowski\u2019s attorney license had also been suspended. O.R. at Item 80, N.T. 3/26/14 at 1. Referee Hess then gave Ostrowski the opportunity to argue why Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217 did not preclude his participation in the hearing, id., N.T. at 1-2, and ultimately concluded Ostrowski would be permitted only to observe the proceedings. Appellee thereafter represented himself, and following the hearing, Referee Hess determined appellee was ineligible to receive benefits.\nOn appeal, the UCBR affirmed the denial of benefits and also concluded the referee properly excluded Bailey and Os-trowski from representing appellee. The UCBR opined Referee Hess had correctly addressed the representation issue by notifying Bailey and the parties that appellee was not permitted to have a suspended attorney as a representative at the continued hearing. UCBR Decision at 3. The UCBR concluded Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217(j)(4)(vii) barred Ostrowski from participating in the hearing, appellee had a sufficient opportunity to find proper legal or non-legal representation, and appellee received a full and fair hearing, with the opportunity to testify and submit evidence and cross-examine the employer\u2019s witnesses. Id.\nAppellee filed a pro se petition for review in the Commonwealth Court and employer intervened. A divided panel of the Commonwealth Court vacated the UCBR\u2019s ruling and remanded the matter for a new hearing, Powell v. UCBR, 128 A.3d 315 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015). The majority analyzed the interplay between Section 214 of the UC Law, the reasoning of the Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court (OAJC) in Harkness v. UCBR, 591 Pa. 543, 920 A.2d 162 (2007), and Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217.\nThe Commonwealth Court acknowledged Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217 specifically prohibits formerly admitted or suspended attorneys\u2014such as Bailey and Ostrowski\u2014from \u201cappearing on behalf of a client in any hearing or proceeding or before any judicial officer, arbitrator, mediator, court, public agency, referee, magistrate, hearing officer or any other adjudicative person or body.\u201d Powell, 128 A.3d at 320, quoting Pa.R.D,E. 217(j)(4)(vii) (emphasis omitted). The court also recognized Section 214 of the UC Law allows a party in unemployment compensation proceedings to be represented by \u201can attorney or other representative,\u201d including non-attorneys. The court then noted that, in Harkness, the OAJC concluded representation of a party before a unemployment compensation referee does not constitute the practice of law because such proceedings are \u201clargely routine and primarily focused on creating a factual basis, or record, by which the referee can render a decision\u201d and the nature of the proceedings is remedial and designed to be brief and informal. Powell, 128 A.3d at 320, quoting Harkness, 920 A.2d at 166, 168-69 (OAJC).\nThe Commonwealth Court concluded the UCBR improperly precluded suspended attorneys Bailey and Ostrowski from representing appellee because Section 214 of the UC Law gives a party the statutory right to choose his representative before an unemployment compensation referee, and under Harkness such representation does not constitute the practice of law. Powell, 128 A.3d at 320. The court rejected the UCBR\u2019s reliance upon the Disciplinary Enforcement Rules for its contrary decision because, in its view, enforcement of the Disciplinary Enforcement Rules falls within the exclusive authority of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and the Disciplinary Board. Id. at 321, citing Pa.R.D,E. 201(a) (exclusive disciplinary jurisdiction of Supreme Court and Disciplinary Board under these rules extends to attorney admitted to practice law in Commonwealth and formerly admitted attorney). The court acknowledged this Court previously held a suspended attorney in contempt for violation of Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217(j) for representing claimants in unemployment proceedings. Powell, 128 A.3d at 321, citing In the Matter of David Louis Bargeron, No. 1073 DD3, 2011 Pa. LEXIS 1695, at *1 (Pa. July 27, 2011) (per curiam) (holding suspended attorney in contempt of Rule 217(j) and ordering attorney to immediately cease and desist from all activities in connection with representation of claimants and employers in unemployment compensation proceedings and comply with all provisions of Rule 217). The Commonwealth Court nevertheless concluded it was more consistent with Section 214 of the UC Law and Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217(j) for the referee to allow a suspended attorney to participate, advise him that his continued representation could subject him to sanctions for violation of Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217, and report the attorney to the Disciplinary Board for further action as in Bargeron. Powell, 128 A.3d at 321.\nThe UCBR filed a petition for allowance of appeal, and we granted review of the following question: \u201cShould a Commonwealth agency be required to allow a suspended attorney to represent a party in its hearings and proceedings?\u201d Powell v. UCBR (Joe Krentzman & Sons, Inc.), 635 Pa. 219, 134 A.3d 448 (2016).\nThe UCBR asserts the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision undermines the attorney disciplinary system created to protect legal consumers from persons found unqualified to serve as attorneys. The UCBR argues the Commonwealth Court ignored the plain language of Section 214 of the UC Law which authorizes representation by either an \u201cattorney\u201d or \u201cother representative\u201d and Bailey and Ostrowski fall in neither category as they are \u201cformerly admitted attorneys.\u201d UCBR Brief at 12-13. In the UCBR\u2019s view, the court\u2019s reliance on Harkness is misplaced because the two-Justice OAJC addressed representation by non-attorneys, but did not account for \u201cformerly admitted attorneys\u201d who have been suspended and therefore are prohibited by the Disciplinary Enforcement Rules from appearing before a referee. According to the UCBR, the Disciplinary Enforcement Rules do not simply govern the practice of law, but also the conduct of attorneys and formerly admitted attorneys. Id. at 13-14, citing Pa.R.D.E. 201(a) (exclusive jurisdiction of Supreme Court and Disciplinary Board extends to any formerly admitted attorney whose actions constitute violation of Disciplinary Enforcement Rules). The UCBR argues this Court\u2014through disciplinary proceedings\u2014determined Bailey and Ostrowski were unqualified to represent clients when they purported to represent appellee, and the ruling below subverts this determination.\nIn addition, the UCBR rejects the Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion that Referee Hess, by precluding Bailey and Os-trowski from representing appellee, was improperly prosecuting and enforcing the Disciplinary Enforcement Rules. The UCBR argues instead the referee was simply honoring this Court\u2019s suspension orders. The UCBR contends this Court\u2019s disciplinary authority will be undermined if an agency allows a suspended attorney to violate the Disciplinary Enforcement Rules by appearing before the agency as a party\u2019s representative. The UCBR further argues the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision frustrates the public protection aspects of those Rules. The UCBR asserts the process outlined by the Commonwealth Court involving an after-the-fact complaint to the Disciplinary Board about a suspended attorney\u2019s participation in agency proceedings does not undo or mitigate harm that may have occurred to the parties or to the timeliness and accuracy of the unemployment compensation adjudicative process. The UCBR posits allowing representation of a party by a suspended attorney creates potential error in agency proceedings and undermines the finality of agency decisions.\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed an amicus curiae brief in support of the UCBR\u2019s position. The ODC argues the UCBR is authorized to prohibit suspended attorneys from representing clients in unemployment compensation proceedings and the UCBR did not invade this Court\u2019s jurisdiction in affirming the referee\u2019s decision to do so here. The ODC notes suspended attorneys are qualitatively different from non-lawyer representatives who may otherwise appear before agencies on behalf of claimants\u2014suspended attorneys are not only prohibited from the practice of law, but also from conducting other law-related activities. Amicus Brief at 19-20, citing Pa.R.D.E. 217(j)(4)(vii) (formerly admitted attorney prohibited from appearing before administrative referees or boards). According to the ODC, the distinction between suspended attorneys and non-lawyer representatives is based not on legal ability, a characteristic rendered immaterial by the Harkness plurality\u2019s conclusion that proceedings before the UCBR do not constitute the practice of law, but on the basis of the lack of ethical fitness to act as an advocate. The ODC argues the UCBR properly exercised its authority pursuant to Section 503 of the Administrative Agency Law, which provides an \u201cagency may, upon hearing and good cause shown, preclude any person from practice before it.\u201d See 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 503. The ODC posits the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision actually contravenes this Court\u2019s authority by permitting a suspended attorney to ignore the Court\u2019s suspension orders. Further, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision places referees in an ethical quandary because allowing a suspended attorney to violate Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217 may be seen as assisting in a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which itself may be professional misconduct. Amicus Brief at 22-23, citing Pa.R.P.C, 8.4 (professional misconduct includes engaging in conduct prejudicial to administration of justice). The ODC also contends the Commonwealth Court\u2019s analysis is faulty based upon an overly broad interpretation of the term \u201cenforce,\u201d as used in the court\u2019s theory the referee and UCBR overstepped their bounds by \u201cenforcing\u201d the Court\u2019s order. The ODC asserts a referee\u2019s refusal to participate in or to allow a violation of the law does not amount to unauthorized \u201cenforcement\u201d of this Court\u2019s order.\nAppellee argues the UCBR was without jurisdiction to deny him his right to the representative of his choice and by doing so violated his rights under Pennsylvania law, the Pennsylvania Constitution and the First, Seventh and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Appellee argues pursuant to Harkness and Bargeron he was entitled to be represented by Bailey and Ostrowski and that the referee had no right to determine who \u201cany other representative was.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 7, 9. Appellee asserts the referee\u2019s decision left him unable to \u201cdefend\u201d himself or \u201cpresent his case\u201d and \u201cdenied [him] a lawful hearing.\u201d Id. at 4, 7. Appellee summarily alleges the UCBR violated his rights to equal protection and substantive due process by denying him the representation of his choice. He further \u201cobjects to the unconstitutional nature of the vaguely and in-artfully composed\u201d Disciplinary Enforcement Rules and the unconstitutional way those rules were applied to him by the UCBR, which did not have the authority to deny him \u201cthe representation of \u2018other representatives\u2019 such as Mr. Bailey and Mr. Ostrowski.\u201d Id. at 10,\nAs the issue before us involves a pure question of law, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Harkness, 920 A.2d at 166 n.2, citing Buffalo Twp. v. Jones, 571 Pa. 637, 813 A.2d 659, 664 n.4 (2002). Our careful review reveals the Commonwealth Court erred in reversing the UCBR and directing it to allow individuals who have been suspended from the practice of law to participate in unemployment compensation proceedings on behalf of a claimant. We consider suspended attorneys to be different from non-lawyer representatives who are authorized to participate in unemployment compensation matters pursuant to Section 214 of the UC Law. Instead, suspended attorneys are individuals who have actually been sanctioned by this Court for violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct and now are \u201cformerly admitted attorneys\u201d who are expressly prohibited from appearing on behalf of a client \u201cin any hearing or proceeding\u201d pursuant to Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217(j)(4)(vii). Suspended attorneys may therefore not act as the non-lawyer representatives referred to in Section 214. We reject appellee\u2019s claim he has a constitutional right to be represented by suspended attorneys who have been specifically precluded by this Court\u2019s rules from acting as his representative.\nThe Pennsylvania Constitution vests this Court with the authority to regulate the practice of law. Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 10(c) (\u201cThe Supreme Court shall have the power to prescribe general rules governing practice, procedure and the conduct of all courts, ... including the power to provide for ... admission to the bar and to practice law....\u201d). Pursuant to its authority, \u201cthis Court has adopted Rules of Professional Conduct and Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement, which govern the conduct and discipline of attorneys.\u201d Commonwealth v. Stern, 549 Pa. 505, 701 A.2d 568, 571 (1997); see also Pa. R.D.E. 103 (\u201cThe Supreme Court declares that it has inherent and exclusive power to supervise the conduct of attorneys who are its officers (which power is reasserted in Section 10(c) of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania) and in furtherance thereof promulgates these rules.\u201d).\nWe first review this Court\u2019s OAJC in Harkness, on which the Commonwealth Court relied but which we conclude is inapposite. In Harkness, the employer was represented in unemployment compensation proceedings by a tax consultant who was not\u2014and never was\u2014an attorney. The referee allowed the representation over the claimant\u2019s objection, and the UCBR affirmed on appeal. The en banc Commonwealth Court reversed, determining it was error to allow a non-attorney tax consultant to represent the employer. Harkness v. UCBR, 867 A.2d 728 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2005) (en banc), rev\u2019d by Harkness v. UCBR, 591 Pa. 543, 920 A.2d 162 (2007). The court ruled the employer\u2019s tax consultant was improperly engaging in the practice of law because he conducted cross-examination of witnesses, made decisions regarding evidentiary matters and offered closing legal arguments; the court found such practice by a non-lawyer was prohibited by Shortz v. Farrell, 327 Pa. 81, 193 A. 20 (1933), and the UC Law, as well as regulations promulgated pursuant to the UC Law. Harkness, 867 A.2d at 731, citing 43 P.S. \u00a7 862 (limiting fees charged by counsel or other duly authorized agent representing individuals); 34 Pa. Code \u00a7 101.41 (approval of counsel fees for individuals represented by counsel or authorized agent). Notably, the court examined Section 702 of the UC Law, 43 P.S. \u00a7 862, which addresses limitations on fees sought by a claimant\u2019s counsel or duly authorized agents, and concluded because Section 702 addressed only fees for a claimant\u2019s counsel or agent, the UC Law did not authorize non-lawyer representation for employers. Id. at 732 n.6. Thus, the Commonwealth Court held only a claimant\u2014and not an employer\u2014could be represented by a non-lawyer in unemployment compensation proceedings. Id. at 731-32.\nThis Court granted allocatur to consider \u201cwhether a non-employee, non-lawyer may represent an employer in unemployment compensation proceedings.\u201d Harkness, 920 A.2d at 166 (OAJC). A plurality reversed the Commonwealth Court, with two justices reasoning that a non-attorney representing an employer in unemployment compensation proceedings does not constitute the unauthorized practice of law, and otherwise does not violate the relevant UC Law provisions. Id. at 169 (OAJC). First, the Harkness OAJC states the character of the activities performed in unemployment compensation proceedings, together with the informal nature of those proceedings, the minimal monetary amounts at issue and the long history of non-lawyer representative participation suggested the public did not need the protection that serves as the basis for classifying certain activities as the practice of law. Id. at 168. Second, the OAJC notes the wording of other provisions of the UC Law demonstrates both employers and claimants may be represented by non-lawyers. Id. at 170-71, citing 48 P.S. \u00a7 822 (parties and their attorneys or other representatives of record shall be notified of time and place of hearing and referee\u2019s decision).\nThe legal conclusions expressed in the Harkness OAJC in no way alter our analysis of the issue before us because that case is distinguishable on its facts. Harkness involved a non-lawyer tax consultant and the case revolved, in substantial part, around the distinction between who may represent claimants and who may represent employers. Moreover, the critical question regarding which party may engage a non-lawyer representative in unemployment compensation proceedings was definitively resolved by the General Assembly after the hearing in that case, and while the matter was on appeal. See 43 P.S. \u00a7 774 (\u201cAny party in any proceeding under this act before the department, a referee or the board may be represented by an attorney or other representative.\u201d); see also Harkness, 920 A.2d at 171 (Eakin, J., dissenting, joined by Castille, J.).\nIn any event, notwithstanding the statements in the Harkness OAJC regarding non-lawyer representatives and the nature of unemployment compensation proceedings, as well as Justice Todd\u2019s similar statements in dissent regarding \u201cnon-attorneys,\u201d it is clear suspended attorneys like Bailey and Ostrowski are in a different class from \u201cnon-lawyer representatives\u201d who may appear on behalf of any party in unemployment compensation proceedings. Suspended attorneys are \u201cformerly admitted attorneys\u201d who remain subject to the Disciplinary Enforcement Rules and the terms of this Court\u2019s orders relating to their suspensions. Specifically, the suspension orders in this case provided Bailey and Ostrowski \u201cshall comply with all the provisions of Rule 217, Pa.R.D.E.\u201d Bailey, 2013 Pa. LEXIS 2269, at *1; Ostrowski, 2010 Pa. LEXIS 114, at *1. Rule 217 expressly prohibits these attorneys from \u201cappearing on behalf of a client in any hearing or proceeding or before any judicial officer, arbitrator, mediator, court, public agency, referee, magistrate, hearing officer or any other adjudicative person or body.\u201d Pa.R.D.E. 217(j)(4)(vi). The Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion that the unemployment compensation referee and the UCBR could not apply the terms of Rule 217 and this Court\u2019s suspension orders in its tribunals was error.\nOur decision is informed by an understanding that the purpose of the attorney disciplinary process, including proceedings which may result in this Court\u2019s issuance of suspension or disbarment orders, is to determine whether an attorney is fit to act as an advocate in legal and law-related activities and proceedings. See Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Campbell, 463 Pa. 472, 345 A.2d 616, 620 (1975) (purpose of disciplinary proceedings is not punishment, but rather to determine fitness of officer of the court to continue in that capacity). Moreover, orders of suspension or disbarment are designed to protect the public from attorneys who have been deemed unfit and to maintain the public\u2019s regard for a profession imbued with its trust. Id. The reports and recommendations returned to this Court by the Disciplinary Board in both Bailey\u2019s and Ostrowski\u2019s disciplinary proceedings recommended suspension in order to accomplish these salutary objectives. Moreover, the Court\u2019s orders specifically directed Bailey and Ostrowski to comply with the provisions of Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217 while they remained suspended. Bailey, 2013 Pa, LEXIS 2269, at *1; Ostrowski, 2010 Pa. LEXIS 114, at *1. Consequently, this Court determined Bailey and Ostrowski were unfit at all relevant times to appear on behalf of an individual \u201cin any hearing or proceeding or before any judicial officer, arbitrator, mediator, court, public agency, referee, magistrate, hearing officer or any other adjudicative person or body.\u201d Pa.R.D.E. 217(j)(4)(vi).\nWe also conclude the referee and UCBR did not infringe upon this Court\u2019s jurisdiction over attorney discipline as argued by appellee. Indeed, in precluding participation by suspended attorneys, the lower tribunals were actually recognizing and upholding the force and effect of this Court\u2019s orders with regard to the two attorneys\u2019 suspended status. Cf. Slater v. Rimar, Inc., 462 Pa. 138, 338 A.2d 584, 589 (1975) (although breaches of Rules of Professional Conduct may be subject of disciplinary action, trial courts need not await such proceedings, but may restrain improper conduct pursuant to court\u2019s inherent power to control pending proceedings and a duty to supervise conduct of lawyers appearing before court). Moreover, the referee\u2019s decision to preclude participation by the suspended attorneys is supported by separate statutory authority. See, e.g., 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 503 (\u201cAny Commonwealth agency may, upon hearing and good cause shown, preclude any person from practice before it.\u201d). The Commonwealth Court\u2019s suggested alternative method of confronting the problem of suspended attorneys appearing in agency proceedings\u2014allowing participation but referring the attorney to the Disciplinary Board\u2014does not mitigate the harm to the party, and actually undermines the timeliness and finality of the UC adjudicative process, where a party might later have reason to object to the aware} based on participation of an ethically or otherwise compromised attorney. See, e.g., 34 Pa. Code \u00a7 101.104(c)(2) (pursuant to Section 504 of UC Law, 43 P.S. \u00a7 824, UCBR, in its discretion, may remand to referee to take additional evidence if \u201c[i]t appears that there may have been a denial of a fair hearing under the rules\u201d). Cf. Johnson v. WCAB, 14 Pa.Cmwlth. 220, 321 A.2d 728, 730 (1974) (proof that claimant\u2019s counsel was incompetent might constitute good cause to allow rehearing).\nWith regard to appellee\u2019s constitutional argument the referee and the UCBR violated his rights to equal protection and substantive due process by denying him the representative of his choice, we note neither the United States Constitution nor the Pennsylvania Constitution guarantees the right to representation in civil proceedings, although such right is guaranteed in criminal proceedings. See, e.g., U.S. Const. Amend. 6 (\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right.. .to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d); Pa. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 9 (\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused hath a right to be heard by himself and his counsel ...\u201d). To the extent the United States Supreme Court suggested in Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158 (1932), albeit in dicta, that a court\u2019s refusal to hear a party\u2019s representative in a civil case could constitute a denial of due process, the High Court conditioned its statement on the court\u2019s refusal being \u201carbitrary,\u201d which is clearly not the case here. Id. at 69, 53 S.Ct. 55 (\u201cIf in any case, civil or criminal, a state or federal court were arbitrarily to refuse to hear a party by counsel, employed by and appearing for him, it reasonably may not be doubted that such a refusal would be a denial of a hearing, and, therefore, of due process in the constitutional sense.\u201d). Even in the context of criminal proceedings, this Court has opined \u201cthe right to be represented by counsel of one\u2019s own choice is not absolute, however. The right to counsel may be impaired or eliminated by state regulation which is designed to provide for overriding state interest....\u201d Commonwealth v. Hess, 532 Pa. 607, 617 A.2d 307, 314 (1992). Thus, a party\u2019s right to a representative or counsel of choice may be circumscribed where necessary, particularly in a case like this one, which is expressly encompassed by the restrictions of this Court\u2019s suspension order and Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217. Appellee has provided no applicable support for his claim of constitutional entitlement, and in light of this Court\u2019s clear authority to establish standards for the conduct of attorneys in order to protect the public from unfit advocates and thereby maintain the public\u2019s confidence in the legal system, we conclude appellee is not entitled to be represented by a suspended or disbarred attorney in unemployment compensation proceedings.\nAccordingly, we affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision to remand for further proceedings, but reverse its holding a suspended attorney may represent claimants in unemployment compensation proceedings. The matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, including a hearing before an unemployment compensation referee during which appellee may choose to proceed pro se or with qualified representation.\nAffirmed in part and reversed in part. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice Saylor and Justices Donohue, Wecht and Mundy join the opinion.\nJustice Baer files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nJustice Todd files a dissenting opinion.\n.

Ostrowski\u2019s suspension was based on violations of Pa.R.P.C. 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client), Pa.R.P.C. 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), Pa.R.P.C. 1.15(a) and (b) (safekeeping of property), and Disciplinary Enforcement Rule 217(e) (formerly admitted attorney shall file verified statement with this Court showing compliance with Rule 217). Report and Recommendations of the Disciplinaiy Board of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania at 11-12, http://www.padisciplinaiyboard.org/look-up/pa-attomey-search.php (last visited on December 7, 2016). At the time of the hearing, Ostrowski was eligible to seek reinstatement to the practice of law by this Court. However, at that time, Ostrowski had not been reinstated by this Court, and thus remained suspended from the Bar. See Pa.R.D.E. 218(a)(1) (attorney, who was suspended for more than one year, may not resume practice until reinstatement by order of the Supreme Court).\n. Judge Brobson authored the majority opinion and was joined by Judge McCullough. Judge McGinley dissented without opinion. Prior to issuing its final decision, the Commonwealth Court issued an earlier order and opinion, Powell v. UCBR, 1704 C.D. 2014, 2015 WL 5455645, 2015 Pa. Commw. LEXIS 398 (Pa. Cmwlth. Sept, 17, 2015), but withdrew it upon motion for reconsideration, Powell v. UCBR, 128 A.3d 315 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015), and on the same day substituted the opinion found at 128 A.3d 315.\n. The Harkness OAJC was authored by Chief Justice Cappy, and joined by Justice Baer. Justice Saylor concurred in the result only, without opinion. Justice Eakin wrote a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Justice Castille. Former Justices Nigro and Newman did not participate,\n. In Shortz, this Court held an insurance adjuster who prepared and filed pleadings, appeared at hearings before referees, examined and cross-examined witnesses and in general conducted litigation in workmen\u2019s compensation cases was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. Shortz, 193 A. at 21.\n. The dissent opined the tax representative was engaged in the unlawful practice of law under Shortz. Harkness, 920 A.2d at 171 (Eakin, J., dissenting, joined by Castille, J.). The dissent also observed that, following the underlying unemployment compensation hearing, the General Assembly enacted Section 214 of the UC Law, expressly allowing any party to be represented by \"an attorney or other representative.\u201d In the dissent\u2019s view, the \"other representative\u201d language encompasses a corporate officer or member of the employer's own staff, but does not include a non-employee representative because allowing such representation would infringe on this Court\u2019s authority to regulate the practice of law, including defining the practice of law. Id. at 172.\n. Because the suspension orders are enforceable specifically against them as individuals, it was incumbent upon Bailey and Ostrowski as formerly admitted attorneys to decline the opportunity to represent appellee. See, e.g., Pa.R.D.E. 217(a) (formerly admitted attorney must notify clients of suspension status and advise clients to seek legal advice elsewhere); Pa.R.D.E, 217(b) (formerly admitted attorney must notify clients involved in pending administrative proceedings of suspension); Pa.R.D.E, 217(c)(3) (formerly admitted attorney must give notice of suspension to \"any other tribunal, court, agency or jurisdiction in which attorney is admitted to practice\u201d); Pa.R.D.E. 217(e)(1) (formerly admitted attorney must file with Secretary of the Disciplinary Board verified statement of compliance with Pa.R.D,E. 217). This duty is distinct and separate from appellee\u2019s statutory right to select a representative, 43 P.S, \u00a7 774.\n. The dissent notes the UCBR as an executive agency is not bound by this Court\u2019s suspension orders. Dissenting Op, (Todd, J. dissenting) at 581-82, 157 A.3d at 898. There is no dispute, however, that formerly admitted attorneys appearing before the Board are surely bound by this Court\u2019s suspension orders. See, e.g., Pa.R.D.E. 217(j) (formerly admitted attorney may not engage in any form of law-related activities in the Commonwealth except in limited circumstances). Accordingly, the UCBR correctly gave due deference to this Court\u2019s conclusion the suspended attorneys were unfit to represent clients in any hearing or proceeding or before a referee or any other adjudicative person or body.\n. We recognize unemployment compensation referees are not imbued with the same powers as a trial court, but they are nevertheless authorized to regulate the course of hearings and to take other action necessary or appropriate to the discharge of the duties vested in them. See 1 Pa. Code \u00a7 35.187(1), (10) (\"Presiding officers ... shall have the authority, within the powers and subject to the regulations of the agency,\u201d to regulate the course of hearings and to \"... take other action necessary or appropriate to the discharge of the duties vested in them, consistent with the statutory or other authorities under which the agency functions and with the regulations and policies of the agency.\u201d).\n. We recognize Justice Baer would not allow appellee another opportunity to obtain eligible representation at a new hearing. The position has facial appeal. However, we note the legal landscape before today's decision included Harkness, supra, where this Court held\u2014in a different context\u2014that representation of individuals in unemployment compensation hearings did not constitute the practice of law, and may have been read to support appellee\u2019s decision to hire suspended attorneys. As the question regarding suspended attorneys has now been squarely presented and addressed for the first time in this case, we consider a remand the proper course."}
