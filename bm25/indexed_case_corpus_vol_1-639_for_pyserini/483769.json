{"id": "483769", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM.\nIn this direct appeal the only issue raised is that the lower court erred in having the jury \u201cconsider their verdict in the courtroom rather than in the sanctity of the jury room.\u201d However, the trial record of the verdiet proceedings shows that the defect in the verdict, which the court requested the jury to reconsider and correct, was purely a matter of form. Being sufficient in substance, it was proper for the trial court to direct the jury how it may be amended. Commonwealth v. Komatowski, 347 Pa. 445, 455, 32 A.2d 905, 906 (1943). See also, Commonwealth v. Dzuonick, 450 Pa. 98, 102, 297 A.2d 912, 914 (1972). Since all the jurors agreed that they intended to render a verdict of guilty of voluntary manslaughter, it was unnecessary for the jury to return to the jury room to make the necessary mechanical correction. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 369 Pa. 120, 122, 85 A.2d 171, 172 (1952).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed."}
