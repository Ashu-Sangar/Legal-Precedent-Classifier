{"id": "1906739", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nThe case at bar was previously heard and decided in this court in Gray v. Grunnagle, 423 Pa. 144, 223 A. 2d 663 (1966). The plaintiff had won a jury verdict in a trespass action against defendant, and a judgment n.o.v. had been entered for the defendant. On plaintiff\u2019s appeal, we reversed the judgment n.o.v. and entered judgment on the jury verdict for plaintiff.\nSubsequent to the trial of the action, defendant had filed, in addition to a motion for judgment n.o.v., a motion for new trial. As hereinbefore stated, the motion for judgment n.o.v. was granted, and consequently, the new trial motion was denied as being moot. Following our reversal of the judgment n.o.v., defendant applied to the court below for disposition of his new trial motion. The court below properly refused such disposition on the ground that it was precluded from passing on the new trial motion by our entry of judgment on the verdict. Defendant has now appealed, and plaintiff has filed a motion to quash the appeal which we ordered to be argued at the time of oral argument on the merits. At argument, however, we restricted counsel to argument on the motion to quash.\nIn the previous appeal, the entire record below was before us, and all of the matters raised in defendant\u2019s new trial motion were carefully considered by us and rejected, even though they may not have been specifically treated in our opinion. Moreover, the matters raised in defendant\u2019s new trial motion were again considered in connection with defendant\u2019s petition for re-argument filed subsequent to our former opinion in this case. We conclude that no useful purpose would be served in opening the judgment heretofore entered and remanding the matter to the court below for disposition of the new trial motion, inasmuch as we have, in effect, already considered these matters and found no basis for the grant of a new trial. We shall, therefore, grant plaintiff\u2019s motion to quash the appeal.\nAppeal quashed."}
