{"id": "989665", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nOur consideration of the testimony sent up with the record has satisfied us that it was insufficient to justify the submission of plaintiff\u2019s claim to the jury, and hence the court below committed no error in refusing to take off the judgment of nonsuit ordered at the trial. It is unnecessary either to summarize or discuss the evidence on which the plaintiff relies.\nJudgment affirmed."}
