{"id": "3787842", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice NEWMAN.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (\u201cthe Third Circuit\u201d) petitioned this Court for certification of a question of Pennsylvania law. Writing for the Third Circuit, Judge Marjorie O. Rendell sought certification of the following question: whether a health maintenance organization (HMO) is exempt, by virtue of the Pennsylvania Health Maintenance Organization Act (HMO Act), 40 P.S. \u00a7 1560(a), from complying with the anti-subrogation provision of the Pennsylvania Motor Vehicle Financial Responsibility Law (MVFRL), 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1720? We granted the Petition for Certification of a Question of Law on July 8, 2005. After careful consideration, we answer the question in the affirmative, and hold that an HMO is exempt from the anti-subrogation provision of the MVFRL.\nFacts and Procedural History\nJonathan Wirth (Wirth) received medical care for injuries he sustained in a motor vehicle accident on October 5, 2002. His medical care was covered under an HMO contract issued by Aetna U.S. Healthcare (Aetna) to Wirth\u2019s father. The Certificate of Coverage issued to Wirth\u2019s father provided:\nIf HMO provides health care benefits under this Certificate to a Member for injuries or illness for which a third party is or may be responsible, then HMO retains the right to repayment of the full cost of all benefits provided by HMO on behalf of the Member that are associated with the injury or illness for which the third party is [or may be responsible], HMO\u2019s rights of recovery apply to any recoveries made by or on behalf of the Member from the following third-party sources, as allowed by law, including but not limited to: payments made by a third-party tortfeasor or any insurance company on behalf of the third-party tortfeasor. ...\nThe Member specifically acknowledges HMO\u2019s right of subrogation. When HMO provides health care benefits for injuries or illnesses for which a third party is or may be responsible, HMO shall be subrogated to the Member\u2019s rights of recovery against any third party to the extent of the full cost of all benefits provided by HMO, to the fullest extent permitted by law. HMO may proceed against any third party with or without the Member\u2019s consent.\nReproduced Record (R.R.) 66a. The effective date of the Group Agreement was September 1, 2002.\nAfter Wirth recovered a settlement from the third-party tortfeasor, Aetna asserted a subrogation lien for its costs. Wirth paid Aetna $2,066.90 to release its lien. He then filed a class action suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, alleging, inter alia, unjust enrichment and that the subrogation lien violated Section 1720 of the MVFRL, which provides:\nIn actions arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, there shall be no right of subrogation or reimbursement from a claimant\u2019s tort recovery with respect to workers\u2019 compensation benefits, benefits available under section 1711 (relating to required benefits), 1712 (relating to availability of benefits) or 1715 (relating to availability of adequate limits) or benefits paid or payable by a program, group contract or other arrangement whether primary or excess under section 1719 (relating to coordination of benefits).\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1720.\nAetna removed the suit to federal district court, asserting that Wirth\u2019s suit was a civil action under ERISA to recover benefits, and therefore, was preempted completely. Thereafter, Aetna filed a Motion to Dismiss, contending that it is exempt from Section 1720 of the MVFRL because of Section 1560(a) of the HMO Act, which provides:\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this act, a health maintenance organization operating under the provisions of this act shall not be subject to the laws of this State now in force relating to insurance corporations engaged in the business of insurance nor to any law hereafter enacted relating to the business of insurance unless such law specifically and in exact terms applies to such health maintenance organization. For a health maintenance organization established, operated and maintained by a corporation, this exemption shall apply only to the operations and subscribers of the health maintenance organization.\n40 P.S. \u00a7 1560(a). The federal district court agreed with Aetna, concluding that nothing in Section 1720 of the MVFRL \u201cspecifically and in exact terms\u201d applies to HMOs as required by Section 1560 of the HMO Act. Accordingly, the federal district court granted the Motion to Dismiss filed by Aetna and dismissed Wirth\u2019s claims.\nOn appeal, the Third Circuit concluded that the seemingly incongruous statutory provisions should be decided by this Court before it renders a final decision in this matter. Therefore, it certified the question to us, which is set forth above.\nDiscussion\nStatutory Interpretation\nIn 1972, the General Assembly promulgated the HMO Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1551-1584. Section 1552 of the Act provides:\nThe purpose of this act is to permit and encourage the formation and regulation of health maintenance organizations and to authorize the Secretary of Health to provide technical advice and assistance to corporations desiring to establish, operate and maintain a health maintenance organization to the end that increased competition and consumer choice offered by diverse health maintenance organizations can constructively serve to advance the purposes of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness and access.\n40 P.S. \u00a7 1552. Consistent with this goal, the General Assembly enacted Section 1560(a) of the Act, which provides that an HMO operating pursuant to the Act shall not be subject to \u201cthe laws of this State now in force relating to insurance corporations engaged in the business of insurance nor to any law hereafter enacted relating to the business of insurance unless such law specifically and in exact terms applies to such health maintenance organization.\u201d Aetna asserts that the plain language of the relevant statute exempts it from the anti-subrogation provisions of Section 1720 of the MVFRL because Section 1720 does not provide \u201cspecifically and in exact terms that it applies to a health maintenance organization.\u201d\nWirth, however, contends that the \u201cplain, expansive and all-inclusive\u201d language of Section 1720, which provides for \u201cno right of subrogation ... with respect to ... benefits paid or payable by a program, group contract or other arrangement,\u201d supports his position that the anti-subrogation provision applies. (Brief of Appellant at 11.) He asserts that the broad term \u201cprogram, group contract or other arrangement\u201d includes HMOs, as well as \u201cevery conceivable type of healthcare arrangement.\u201d Id. In support of this, he notes the following: (1) Aetna itself uses the words \u201cprogram\u201d and \u201cgroup agreement\u201d in the Certificate of Coverage (R.R. 26a) and Group Insurance Certificate (R.R. 97a) it issues to subscribers such as Wirth\u2019s father; (2) Section 1554(b) of the HMO Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1554(b), states that HMOs shall provide basic health care services either \u201cdirectly or through arrangements\u201d with others; (3) Section 1558 of the HMO Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7 1558, authorizes HMOs to enter into group contracts; and (4) 31 Pa.Code \u00a7 301.62 requires HMOs to file group and non-group contract forms with the Insurance Department. Based on these four factors, Wirth maintains that Section 1720 \u201cspecifically and in exact terms\u201d applies to HMOs.\nHe further asserts that Section 1560(a) of the HMO Act does not exempt HMOs from the provisions of Section 1720 of the MVFRL because, \u201cin common usage, the phrase \u2018program, group contract or other arrangement\u2019 is a specific and exact term that \u2018applies\u2019 to HMO plans.\u201d (Brief of Appellant at 15.) Because Aetna, the HMO Act, and the regulations use the words \u201cprogram, group contract or other arrangement\u201d to describe the HMO agreement in this case, Wirth argues that it is logical to conclude that Section 1720 of the MVFRL \u201cspecifically and in exact terms\u201d applies to HMOs.\nAetna notes that \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.\u201d Section 1903(a) of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a). \u201cThe common and approved usage of the words \u2018specifically\u2019 and \u2018exact\u2019 includes a shared requirement of particularity, which is antithetical to the generalized language of Section 1720.\u201d (Brief of Appellee at 8.) Accordingly, it asserts that the reference in Section 1720 to \u201cbenefits paid or payable by a program, group contract or other arrangement\u201d is not sufficiently particular to apply to HMO benefits. Aetna also contends that Wirth errs when he contends that the words \u201cprogram\u201d and \u201cgroup contract,\u201d as used in Section 1720, refer to HMOs. Such terms are not specific and exact, because as Wirth states, they apply to \u201cevery conceivable type of healthcare arrangement.\u201d (Brief of Appellant at 11.)\nAetna suggests that the HMO exception demonstrates recognition by the General Assembly that there will be insurance laws that on their face arguably apply to HMOs, but from which HMOs are nevertheless exempt because such laws do not apply to them \u201cspecifically and in exact terms.\u201d 40 P.S. \u00a7 1560(a). Support for this position may be found in DiGregorio v. Keystone Health Plan East, 840 A.2d 361 (Pa.Super.2003). In DiGregorio, the appellant raised a bad faith claim against an HMO pursuant to Section 8371 of the Judicial Code, which provides:\nActions on Insurance Policies\nIn an action arising under an insurance policy, if the court finds that the insurer has acted in bad faith toward the insured, the court may take all of the following actions:\n(1) Award interest on the amount of the claim from the date the claim was made by the insured in an amount equal to the prime rate of interest plus 3%.\n(2) Award punitive damages against the insurer.\n(3) Assess court costs and attorney fees against the insurer.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8371. The Superior Court in DiGregorio held that Section 1560 of the HMO Act protects HMOs from statutory bad faith claims. As Aetna points out, the significant aspect of the decision is that the facially comprehensive language of Section 8371, which appears to include any insurer, was not sufficient to preclude application of the HMO exemption.\nIn contrast to Section 1720 of the MYFRL, it is instructive to note that in other statutes containing broad language referring to insurers, the General Assembly has \u201cspecifically and in exact terms\u201d provided that the statutes apply to HMOs. For example, in requiring that family coverage include adopted children, 40 P.S. \u00a7 775.1 states, in relevant part:\n(a) General Rule. This act shall apply to all group or individual health or sickness or accident policies, all group policies, all group or individual contracts or certificates issued by an entity subject to the ... Health Maintenance Organization Act....\nSimilarly, when discussing coverage pursuant to the Insurance Payment to Registered Nurse Law, 40 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3021-3026, the General Assembly provided:\n(a) Coverage Enumerated. This act shall apply to every group policy, contract or certificate issued thereunder, of health, sickness or accident insurance delivered or issued for delivery within the Commonwealth, including, but not limited to policies, contracts or certificates issued by:\n(5) Any voluntary nonprofit health service plan as defined in ... the Health Maintenance Organization Act.\n40 P.S. \u00a7 3023(a).\nWith regard to reimbursement for licensed certified nurse midwife services, 40 P.S. \u00a7 3001 provides in relevant part:\n(a) The act shall apply to every group or individual policy, contract or certificate issued thereunder, of health or sickness, or accident insurance delivered or issued for delivery within this Commonwealth including but not limited to policies, contracts or certificates issued by:\n(5) Any health maintenance organization as defined in ... the \u201cHealth Maintenance Organization Act.\u201d\nWhen the General Assembly wishes to make insurance statutes applicable to HMOs, it does so by using the terms \u201chealth maintenance organization\u201d or \u201cHMO\u201d or by specifically referring to the HMO Act. Furthermore, when it intends to include HMOs within general terms such as \u201cinsurer\u201d or \u201cmanaged care plan,\u201d it does so \u201cspecifically and in exact terms.\u201d\nThe General Assembly recognized that the anti-subrogation provisions of Section 1720 alone do not cover \u201cevery conceivable type of healthcare arrangement,\u201d as Wirth contends, absent additional language that overcomes the statutory exemptions for certain types of benefits. Similar to HMOs, hospital plan corporations and professional health care service corporations are exempt from insurance statutes that do not \u201cspecifically refer and apply\u201d to them. See 40 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6103(a) (hospital plan corporations), 40 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6307 (professional health service corporations). Because of these exemptions, the General Assembly promulgated Section 1719(b) of the MVFRL, which Section 1720 incorporates by reference, to provide in relevant part:\n(a) General rule. \u2014 except for workers\u2019 compensation, a policy of insurance issued or delivered pursuant to this sub-chapter shall be primary. Any program, group contract or other arrangement for payment of benefits such as described in section 1711 (relating to required benefits) [,] 1721(1) and (2) (relating to availability of benefits) or 1715 (relating to availability of adequate limits) shall be in excess of and not in duplication of any valid and collectible first party benefits provided in section 1711, 1712 or 1715 or workers\u2019 compensation.\n(b) Definition \u2014 As used in this section the term \u201cprogram, group contract other arrangement\u201d includes, but is not limited to, benefits payable by a hospital plan corporation or a professional health service corporation subject to 40 Pa. C.S. Ch. 61 (relating to hospital plan corporations) or 63 (relating to professional health service plan corporations).\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1719(b) (emphasis in original). Although the definition of \u201cprogram, group contract or other arrangement\u201d in Section 1719 is not exclusive, it contains nothing specific or explicit with respect to HMOs, as contrasted with hospital plan corporations and professional health plan service corporations. This omission is significant because elsewhere the General Assembly has expressly included HMOs with hospital plan corporations and professional health service corporations in identifying the entities subject to various insurance laws. For example, the statute mandating coverage for mammographic examinations applies to, inter alia:\nAll group or individual health or sickness or accident insurance policies providing hospital or medical/surgical coverage and all group or individual subscriber contracts or certificates issued by any entity subject to 40 Pa.C.S. Ch. 61 (relating to hospital plan corporations) or 63 (relating to professional health service plan corporations), this act, [or] the act of December 29, 1972 (P.L. 1701, No. 364), known as the \u201cHealth Maintenance Organization Act.\u201d\n40 P.S. \u00a7 764c. See also, 40 P.S. \u00a7 310.1 (Insurance Department licensing provisions) (defining \u201cinsurer\u201d to include, inter alia, a \u201chealth maintenance organization ... professional health services plan corporation subject to 40 Pa.C.S. Ch. 63 (relating to professional health services plan corporations), [and] a hospital plan corporation subject to 40 Pa.C.S. Ch. 61 (relating to hospital plan corporations).\u201d In light of the fact that Section 1719(b) was promulgated to reach classes of benefits that would otherwise be exempt from the anti-subrogation provisions of Section 1720, the absence from Section 1719(b) of anything that \u201cspecifically and in exact terms\u201d applies to HMOs is controlling.\nSection 1560 of the HMO Act provides that HMOs are not subject to any insurance law \u201cunless such law specifically and in exact terms applies to such health maintenance organizations.\u201d Section 1720 of the MVFRL provides that \u201cthere shall be no right of subrogation or reimbursement from a claimant\u2019s tort recovery with respect to ... benefits paid or payable by a program, group contract or other arrangement whether primary or excess.... \u201d The General Assembly did not \u201cspecifically and in exact terms\u201d state that the anti-subrogation provision applies to HMOs. Accordingly, application of the rule of statutory construction that \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage,\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a), leads us to conclude that Section 1720 does not apply to HMOs.\nIrreconcilable Conflict\nThe General Assembly enacted the HMO Act in 1972 and the MVFRL in 1984. Wirth asserts that to the extent that the HMO Act and the MVFRL are in conflict, the antisubrogation provision of the MVFRL should control over the earlier adopted HMO Act. Section 1936 of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1936, provides that whenever statutes enacted by different General Assemblies are irreconcilable, the latest enactment prevails. However, the position of Wirth directly conflicts with the intent of the General Assembly as set forth in Section 1560(a), which provides that an HMO is exempt from laws \u201chereafter enacted relating to the business of insurance unless such law specifically and in exact terms applies to such health maintenance organization.\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, it is clear that in this instance the Legislature intended that statutes promulgated after 1972 would not apply to HMOs unless they so provided in specific and exact terms.\nAccordingly, we reject Wirth\u2019s suggestion that the MVFRL trumps application of Section 1560(a) of the HMO Act.\nPublic Policy\nWirth asserts that prohibiting subrogation furthers the goals of the MVFRL of reducing the cost of automobile insurance and providing complete compensation for individuals injured in motor vehicle accidents. Burstein v. Prudential, 570 Pa. 177, 809 A.2d 204, 208 (2002). He opines that if an HMO is not subject to the anti-subrogation provision of Section 1720, the result will be that in future cases courts may permit injured plaintiffs who are covered by HMOs to plead, prove, and recover their medical expenses from tortfeasors. This, he contends, would conflict with the cost-reduction goals of the MVFRL by increasing the damages for which automobile insurers will be held accountable, thus frustrating the public interest in lower car insurance. (Brief of Appellant at 19.)\nAetna counters that this Court should not engage in a public policy analysis, but that were we to do so, we should consider the purpose of the HMO Act, which is \u201cto advance the purposes of quality assurance, cost-effectiveness and access\u201d to affordable health care. 40 P.S. \u00a7 1552. It asserts that there is no basis to conclude that \u201cin enacting the MVFRL, the General Assembly intended to reduce automobile insurance costs at the expense of. increasing- health care costs by denying HMOs their preexisting subrogation rights.\u201d (Brief of Appellee at 18.)\nAs we explained in Gustine Uniontown Associates, Ltd. v. Anthony Crane Rental, Inc., 577 Pa. 14, 842 A.2d 334, 338 (2004):\nThe balancing of such \u201cpolicy concerns\u201d is the essence of the legislative process. Absent ambiguity or constitutional infirmity, it is not the place of this Court ... to substitute its own balancing of equities in order to determine what ... is most \u201cfair.\u201d (citations omitted).\nBecause Section 1560(a) of the HMO Act is clearly worded and free of ambiguity, and Section 1702 of the MVFRL does not \u201cspecifically and in exact terms\u201d apply to HMOs, we decline Wirth\u2019s invitation to consider legislative intent. \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d Section 1921(b) of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b).\nConclusion\nFor these reasons, we hold that an HMO is exempt from complying with the anti-subrogation provision of the MVFRL.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justice SAYLOR, EAKIN and BAER join the opinion.\nFormer Justice NIGRO did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustice CASTILLE dissents.\n. Pursuant to this Court\u2019s Internal Operating Procedures, we may accept certification of questions from any United States Court of Appeal. See 204 Pa.Code \u00a7 29.45 l(l)(b); Internal Operating Procedures, Rules Regarding Certification of Questions of Pennsylvania Law.\n. By Act of July 2, 1993, P.L. 190 (Act 44), the legislature repealed these provisions as they relate to workers\u2019 compensation benefits.\n. See, e.g., 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5411 (Advance Directive for Health Care Act) (providing that, \"no ... health maintenance organization ... shall\" impose certain requirements with respect to advance directives); 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 54A08 (providing that \"no health maintenance organization . .. may\u201d impose certain requirements with respect to do-not-resuscitate orders); 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4326(/) (applying requirements relating to child medical support \"lo noninsurers providing health care coverage within this Commonwealth, including health maintenance organizations); 35 P.S. \u00a7 6215 (requiring coverage for individuals exposed to DES pursuant to policies \"subject to,\u201d inter alia, the HMO Act); 40 P.S. \u00a7 764c (mandating coverage for mammographic examinations by \"all group or individual subscriber contracts or certificates issues by any entity subject to,\u201d inter alia, the HMO Act); 40 P.S. \u00a7 764e(a) (mandating reimbursement for diabetic supplies by \"group health insurance plans/policies, and all other forms of managed/capitated care plans/policies or subscriber contract or certificate issued by any entity subject to,\u201d) inter alia, the HMO Act; 40 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3803, 3805-3808, 3810 and 3813 (Accident and Health Filing Reform Act) (applying provisions of the Act to \"each insurer and HMO\u201d); and 77 P.S. \u00a7 531(3)(v) (Workers Compensation Act) (referring to \"coordinated care insurers, including those entities subject to the ... Health Maintenance Organization Act\u201d). These examples all demonstrate that when the Legislature intends to include HMOs within general terms such as \u201cinsurer\u201d or \"managed care plan,\u201d it does so specifically and in exact terms.\n. See, e.g., 40 P.S. \u00a7 991.1401 (insurance holding company provisions) (\"The term [\"insurer\u201d] shall include health maintenance organizations as defined in the \"Health Maintenance Organization Act\u201d); 40 P.S. \u00a7 991.2102 (quality health care and accountability provisions) (defining \u201cmanaged health care plan\u201d as \"health care arranged through an entity operating under,\u201d inter alia, the \"Health Maintenance Organization Act\u201d); 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4304.1 (child support provisions) (\"insurer\u201d includes HMO); 35 P.S. \u00a7 5701.1302 (health investment insurance provisions of the Tobacco Settlement Act) (\"insurer\u201d includes ITMO); 35 P.S. \u00a7 7603 (confidentiality of HIV-related information) (\"insurer\u201d includes entities doing business under the HMO Act); 40 P.S. \u00a7 221.1-B (risk-based capital requirements) (\"health organization\u201d includes HMO); 40 P.S. \u00a7 310.1 (insurance agent requirements) (\"insurer\u201d includes HMO); 40 P.S. \u00a7 313.2 (insurance department examination provisions) (\"insurer\u201d includes HMO); 40 P.S. \u00a7 445.2 (insurance company provisions) (\u201cinsurer\u201d includes ITMO); 40 P.S. \u00a7 764(d)(1)(h) (mastectomy and breast cancer reconstruction) (\u201chealth insurance policy\u201d includes a policy offered by or governed under the HMO Act); 40 P.S. \u00a7 746(g) (coverage for mental illness) (\u201chealth insurance policy\u201d includes policy subject to the HMO Act); 40 P.S. \u00a7 981-2(a) (health care individual accessibility provisions) (\"insurer\u201d includes HMO); 40 P.S. \u00a7 991.1103 (long-term care provisions) (\"policy\u201d includes policy delivered or issued for delivery in Pennsylvania by HMO); 40 P.S. \u00a7 991.1201 (universal health insurance claim form provisions) (\"insurer\u201d includes entity subject to the HMO Act); 40 P.S. \u00a7 991.2303 (Children's Health Care Act) (\"insurer\u201d includes HMO): 40 P.S. \u00a7 1302.3 (Pennsylvania Health Care Insurance Portability Act) (\"insurer\u201d includes HMO); 40 P.S. \u00a7 1573 (Women's Preventative Health Services Act) (\u201chealth insurance policy\u201d includes policy issued by an entity subject to HMO Act); 40 P.S. \u00a7 1582 (Health Security Act) (\"health insurance policy\" includes policy offered by or governed under HMO Act); 40 P.S. \u00a7 3041 (reimbursement for hospital emergency facility services) (\"insurer\u201d includes HMO); 40 P.S. \u00a7 3502 (Childhood Immunization Insurance Act) (\"health insurance policy\u201d includes health service plan operating under HMO Act); 40 P.S. \u00a7 3903 (Medical Foods Insurance Coverage Act) (\"health insurance policy\u201d includes health service plan operating under HMO Act); 62 P.S. \u00a7 5001.103 (Children's Health Care Act) (\"insurer\u201d includes HMO); and 77 P.S. 1029.1 (insurance fraud provisions of Workers Compensation Act) (\"insurer\u201d includes HMO)."}
