{"id": "933556", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe will of testator placed the bequest to his daughter in trust- for her, the trust to end in the event of the husband\u2019s death before hers ; that event did not occur, but the marriage relation was dissolved by a decree in divorce. Evidently, the sole purpose of the trust was to protect her estate from the husband Jacob E. Blackmore; the law has severed the matrimonial bond as effectually as death could have done; therefore, the sole purpose of the trust being atan end, the daughter is entitled to the estate. So the court below on the authority of Koenig\u2019s Appeal, 57 Pa. 352, rightly decided.\nThe decree is affirmed on its opinion."}
