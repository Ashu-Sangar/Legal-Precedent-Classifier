{"id": "1179632", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nPhilander C. Knox died in 1921 leaving a will made in 1920. After a number of legacies, he gave the residue to trustees \u201cto hold the same for and during the lifetime of my wife, Lillie S. Knox and my children, and the lifetime of any grandchild or grandchildren who may be living at the time of my death, and for twenty-one years after the death of the longest surviving grandchild living at my decease, for the following uses and purposes\u201d: to pay one-fifth of the net income (after certain annuities) to each of the following for life: his widow, his daughter Rebekah, his sons Reed, Hugh and Philander. The trustees were directed, on the death of his widow, to \u201cdivide the portion of said income theretofore paid to her into four equal parts, and thereafter pay an equal one-fourth part of the same to each of my four children,\u201d naming them, for life. He provided that on the death of his daughter or of his sons Reed or Philander, \u201cleaving issue them surviving, I direct that my trustees shall pay in the same manner to such issue until the termination of the trust . . . per stirpes ...\u201d but if the daughter or Reed or Philander died without surviving issue, \u201ctheir share of said income shall go to the other said surviving child or children named in this clause, the issue of any child deceased taking by representation.\u201d Upon the termination of the trust he directed that the trustees pay and transfer the estate to the living issue of his daughter and his sons Reed and Philander, per stirpes, and in default of issue to his heirs at law.\nHe gave to his granddaughter Kathleen Knox, daughter of his son Hugh, the sum of $50,000 \u201cwhen and at the time she shall have reached the age of twenty-five years\u201d and directed the trustees then to pay it to her.\nTestator was survived by his widow and the four children named. His widow died in 1930 and his son Hugh in 1936. After the widow\u2019s death the income was divided equally among the four children until Hugh\u2019s death. Hugh left a will giving his estate to his widow and appointing her executrix.\nThe appeal comes from the audit of the third and partial account of the trustees, and the question for decision is who, since Hugh\u2019s death, is entitled to the share of the income theretofore received by him. While testator specifically designated what should become of the shares of income given to his wife, daughter, and sons Reed and Philander, he did not provide to whom, after Hugh\u2019s death, the trustees should pay the share of the income theretofore payable to him. The learned court below held testator died intestate of that part of the income and ordered distribution according to the intestate law, i. e., one-third to the executrix of Lillie S. Knox, testator\u2019s widow, one-sixth to the executrix of Hugh Knox, testator\u2019s son, and one-sixth each to Rebekah, Reed and Philander.\nThe sons appeal and contend that the income accruing after Hugh\u2019s death is part of the residuary estate and passes to the three surviving children under the will. On behalf of Kathleen Knox, Hugh\u2019s daughter, the contention is \u201cthat there was no intestacy in the strict sense\u201d; that having given his property to his trustees \u201cto hold\u201d for the purposes of the trust, \u201cno property of any kind remained in the testator\u201d; that the only interest remaining in him was a possibility of reverter; that on Hugh\u2019s death, a resulting trust arose in favor of the persons who at that time were the testator\u2019s heirs, and that she, therefore, was entitled to share with testator\u2019s three surviving children.\nAll parties, therefore, agree that the will named no distributee to receive the % share of the income accruing from the time of Hugh\u2019s death until the trust ends. At death, property passes under the Intestate Acts unless a testator provides otherwise by will proved and construed as the law requires. It is well settled that \u201cthe heir or statutory distributee will not be disinherited except by express words or necessary intendment\u201d: DeSilver\u2019s Estate, 142 Pa. 74, 76, 21 A. 882. The will is to be read as though testator had written in it that on Hugh\u2019s death the trustees should pay the income to the distributees designated by the intestate law. The question presented was so thoroughly considered in the cases in which DeSilver\u2019s will was before this court that nothing can be added to the opinion of Judge Penkose, which was adopted when the case came up the third time: DeSilver\u2019s Estate, 142 Pa. 74, 21 A. 882; Getz\u2019s Appeal, DeSilver\u2019s Estate, 125 Pa. 611, 17 A. 480; Aubert\u2019s Appeal, DeSilver\u2019s Estate, 119 Pa. 48, 12 A. 810; see also Grothe\u2019s Estate, 229 Pa. 186, 78 A. 88; Milliken\u2019s Estate, 227 Pa. 597, 76 A. 749.\nThe intestate law applied from the moment of testator\u2019s death as to all property not disposed of by the will: DeSilver\u2019s Estate (supra); Schuldt v. Reading Trust Co., 292 Pa. 327, 332, 141 A. 152; Gorgas\u2019s Estate, 248 Pa. 343, 93 A. 1073; Moore v. Deyo, 212 Pa. 102, 61 A. 884; Bell\u2019s Estate, 147 Pa. 389, 392, 23 A. 577. The trustees held the property on the trusts expressly declared for the distributees named by the testator, and for those designated by the intestate law; the purpose for which the trust was created has not failed.\nSection 15(c) of the Wills Act, 1917, P. L. 403, 20 PS section 253, does not apply. It is as follows: \u201cUnless a contrary intention shall appear by the will, such real or personal estate, or interests therein, as shall be comprised or intended to be comprised in any devise or bequest in such will contained, which shall fail or be void by reason of the death of the devisee or legatee in the lifetime of the testator, or by reason of such devise or bequest being contrary to law, or otherwise incapable of taking effect, or which shall be revoked by the testator, shall be included in the residuary devise or bequest, if any, contained in such will. In any case where such devise dr bequest which shall fail or be void, or shall be revoked as aforesaid, shall be contained in the residuary clause of such will, it shall pass to and be divided among the other residuary devisees or legatees, if any there be, in proportion to their respective interests in such residue.\u201d\nThe contention is that the bequest of the fourth part of the income in question in this case is within the class described as \u201cotherwise incapable of taking effect.\u201d As has been shown above, this bequest does take effect; it passes to distributees designated by the intestate law, and therefore does not go to the three surviving children alone; it is not a lapsed legacy. An example of a legacy \u201cincapable of taking effect\u201d came up in Thompson\u2019s Estate, 304 Pa. 349, 155 A. 925, where the failure resulted from the refusal to form a partnership which, if formed, could have taken the bequest: see also Moore\u2019s Estate, 101 Pa. Super. Ct. 39; Desh\u2019s Estate, 321 Pa. 286, 184 A. 111.\nDecree affirmed, costs to be paid by appellants."}
