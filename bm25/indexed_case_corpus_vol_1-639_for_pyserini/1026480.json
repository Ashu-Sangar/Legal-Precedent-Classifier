{"id": "1026480", "contents": "The judgment of the court was entered October 16th 1871.\nPer Curiam.\nThe questions arising out of the proof in this case were properly left to the jury. Taking care of the key of the house and repairing the floor after the tenant had voluntarily left, were no eviction. \u25a0 He would have been entitled to enter if he had returned \u2014 but he did not return. He was neither put out nor sold out by the plaintiff. If the acts of the plaintiff would have been no defence in defendant\u2019s favor, it would not avail the surety, and we are very clear they would not have availed him.\nJudgment affirmed."}
