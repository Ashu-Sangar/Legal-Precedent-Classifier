{"id": "8731470", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Chief Justice.\nThis interlocutory pre-trial appeal is from a per curiam order of a three judge Superior Court panel, 261 Pa.Super. 414, 395 A.2d 972, which affirmed an order of the Court of Common Pleas, Lancaster County, denying appellant\u2019s motion to quash an information.\nAppellant, John Wesley Muffley, was arrested on July 1, 1976 and charged with possession of marijuana. While appellant was being processed at the police station, he was required to empty his pockets. At this time, police found one hundred fifty microcaps of what the police believed to be LSD. A criminal complaint charging appellant with possession of marijuana was filed shortly after his arrest. As outside laboratory analysis was required for the LSD, no charges were filed at that time. When the lab analysis subsequently confirmed that the substance was, in fact, LSD, the police, on September 21, 1976, filed a complaint charging appellant with possession of LSD. Meanwhile, on September 1, 1976, an information had been filed charging appellant with possession of marijuana.\nOn June 9, 1977, a preliminary hearing was held on the LSD offense. On June 17, 1977, appellant pled guilty to possessing marijuana. An information on the LSD charge was filed on July 18, 1977. Appellant immediately thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the information, alleging that prosecution on the LSD charge would violate \u00a7 110 of the Crimes Code. The Court of Common Pleas, Lancaster County, denied appellant\u2019s motion. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed. We granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal and this appeal followed.\nAppellant now again alleges that prosecution on the LSD charge is barred by \u00a7 110 of the Crimes Code. That section provides:\n\u201cAlthough a prosecution is for violation of a different provision of the statutes than the former prosecution . . ., it is barred by such former prosecution under the following circumstances:\n\u201c(i) The former prosecution resulted in ... a conviction . . . and the subsequent prosecution is for:\n* * * * * *\n\u201c(ii) Any offense based on the same conduct or arising from the same criminal episode, if such offense was known to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of the first trial and was within the jurisdiction of a single court unless the court ordered a separate trial of the charge of such offense.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 110.\nThe Commonwealth does not argue, nor could it in our view, that the former prosecution for possession of marijuana and the instant prosecution for possession of LSD did not arise from the same criminal episode. Rather, the Commonwealth argues that appellant has waived any \u00a7 110 objection applicable to the instant prosecution by failing to move for consolidation of the two informations. In Commonwealth v. Stewart, 257 Pa.Super. 334, 390 A.2d 1264 (1978), the court found a waiver of a \u00a7 110 violation where the defendant failed to move for consolidation of the separate offenses. We have today, however, reversed the Superior Court\u2019s determination in Stewart. See, Commonwealth v. Stewart, 493 Pa. 24, 425 A.2d 346 (1980).\nIn Stewart, as in Commonwealth v. Holmes, 480 Pa. 536, 391 A.2d 1015 (1978), we rejected the argument espoused by the Commonwealth in the instant case, stating:\n\u201cTo place the responsibility upon appellant to expedite the [information] procedure, over which he had no control, or responsibility, would disrupt the concept of waiver.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Stewart, supra, 493 Pa. at 30, 425 A.2d at 349, quoting Commonwealth v. Holmes, supra, 480 Pa. at 541-42, 391 A.2d at 1018. We thus believe that appellant has not waived the claim instantly advanced.\nWe believe it is clear that both the marijuana and LSD offenses arose from the same criminal episode. Further, while there is no proof that the prosecutor knew of both offenses, we believe that, under the instant facts, the prosecutor should have had such knowledge. This case, like Stewart, fits within the parameters of \u00a7 110. To thus allow prosecution on the LSD charges would violate the Crimes Code.\nOrder of Superior Court is reversed and appellant is discharged.\nLARSEN, J., dissents.\n. This appeal is permitted by our decision in Commonwealth v. Bolden, 472 Pa. 602, 373 A.2d 90 (1977).\n. Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 110."}
