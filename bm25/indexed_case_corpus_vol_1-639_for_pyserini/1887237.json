{"id": "1887237", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Boberts,\nTbe sole question for determination on this appeal from a decree of adoption entered by the Orphans Court of Westmoreland County, is whether the evidence supports the finding by the court below that the natural mother abandoned her child for a period of at least six months. If the evidence establishes abandonment, her consent to the adoption is unnecessary. If, however, the evidence is insufficient to support such a finding, the adoption may not be decreed without her consent. Adoption Act of April 4, 1925, P. L. 127, as amended, 1 P.S. \u00a7\u00a71-7 (1963).\nThe natural mother, age 25, unmarried, and a resident of Clarion County, gave birth to a female child on September 21, 1961, in a Westmoreland County hospital. Three days later, the mother carried the child from the hospital and surrendered the infant to her obstetrician for adoptive placement.\nAt the adoption hearings on October 23 and November 7,1962, the natural mother appeared with counsel and testified in opposition to the adoption of her daughter. On both occasions, then more than a year after she surrendered the child, she testified that prior to October, 1962, she made no attempt or effort to secure custody of her child, did not express to anyone a desire to see or visit the child, nor did she request of her physician-intermediary or of anyone else the return of her child.\nThe essential facts are not in controversy. Appellant resided with her mother in a community of less than 1000 population. Six months before the birth of the child, she left her residence and proceeded to another small Pennsylvania community, where the putative father was located, with the expectation of \u201cgetting married.\" The marriage did not take place; instead the young man had her talk to a clergyman who (according to her testimony) advised \u201cthe only thing I should do was place this child for adoption and start anew, forget about the child and start over.\u201d She then consulted a family agency in Pittsburgh and was referred to a social agency maternity home in Allegheny County. She entered the home and resided there for four months but spent the eighth and ninth months of her pregnancy at the home of the female obstetrician who later served as the intermediary in placing the child with the adoptive parents.\nOn December 21, 1961, almost three months after the surrender of the child, the natural mother (accompanied by her attorney and her mother) appeared at the hospital in Latrobe for a blood grouping test in connection with a pending paternity proceeding against the putative father. The child was brought to the hospital by the obstetrician-intermediary, and the natural mother, child and others were together for several hours. During this visit, the natural mother voiced no desire to keep the child (or to arrange to visit her). Upon leaving the hospital, the intermediary returned the child to the adoptive home.\nOn October 3, 1962, appellant appeared before the Westmoreland County grand jury as a Commonwealth witness in the proceeding against the putative father. During her interview with the district attorney and others, she exhibited no interest in the custody of the child.\nThe record is clear and undisputed, as the lower court found, that the natural mother \u201cmade no attempt to regain custody of the child or to ask for its [her] return until October, 1962.\u201d She explained her inaction from the time of surrender of the child (September, 1961) until October, 1962, in these words (at the hearing of October 23, 1962) : \u201cI was so worried and so sick, I was so worried about my health that I was afraid I couldn\u2019t care for her. Financially I knew my parents would help me. But I just wasn\u2019t secure enough in a financial way. So this summer things became much better and my father signed his entire share of our property over to me. Now I feel, I know I can, care for her myself with the aid of some support from my father\u201d and again (at the hearing of November 7, 1962) : \u201cWell, I talked to the priest and he advised me, we do have to respect the advice of the priest, but I never wanted to give her up at all. Then after I wasn\u2019t feeling good, I was worried and I was sick, and financially I didn\u2019t feel I could care for her. So in June I started getting better and I went to see my father and he deeded over the interest in the property to me and now I feel and I know I can take care of her financially.\u201d\n\u201cAbandonment\u201d under our Adoption Act \u201cmeans conduct on the part of a parent which evidences a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to the child and of refusing or failing to perform parental duties.\u201d This Court has on many occasions construed, discussed and applied the abandonment provisions of the adoption statute. See, e.g., Hangartner Adoption Case, 407 Pa. 601, 181 A. 2d 280 (1962); Maisels Adoption Case, 395 Pa. 329, 149 A. 2d 38 (1959). We said in Davies Adoption Case, 353 Pa. 579, 587, 46 A. 2d 252, 256 (1946), that abandonment \u201crequires an intent to escape parental responsibility, and conduct in effectuation of such intent . . . .\u201d \u201cActually, a finding of abandonment is an ultimate conclusion of fact deduced or inferred by reasoning from established facts . . . .\u201d Ashton Adoption Case, 374 Pa. 185, 195, 97 A. 2d 368, 374 (1953).\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable (and even sympathetic) to the natural mother, the record is unmistakably clear that for a period of approximately thirteen consecutive months she manifested no interest whatever in the child and exhibited no concern for her care or well-being. The natural mother failed to supply any of the physical and emotional requirements of her child. Surely, well-known to everyone are the basic needs of a child and the principles by which a parent of an infant, must abide. She permitted others to give the child that which she herself withheld too long from her \u2014 necessary care and affection. Following the surrender of her daughter, she removed herself completely from the natural mother-child relationship. Appellant hardly could have demonstrated less interest in the child were she a complete and total stranger to her and unaware of her existence.\nParental rights may not be preserved by complete indifference to the daily needs of a child or by merely waiting for some more suitable financial circumstance or convenient time for the performance of parental duties and responsibilities (while others adequately provide the child with her immediate and continuing physical and emotional needs). The parental obligation is a positive duty and requires affirmative performance which may not be delayed beyond the statutory period by the parent if the parental right is not to be forfeited.\nCareful review of the entire record compels the inescapable conclusion that the appellant did, in fact, abandon her child. Appellant\u2019s failure to affirmatively respond as a parent to the natural and day to day needs of her daughter for a period of more than six months is positive proof of the mother\u2019s settled purpose to forego all parental duties and to relinquish all parental claims to her child and deprives her of the right to successfully oppose this adoption. Her assertions of interest in the child during the adoption hearings. are insufficient to overcome the unmistakable fact of her abandonment which existed for about a year. \u201cAbandonment is not an ambulatory thing the legal effects of which a delinquent parent may dissipate at will by the expression of a desire for the return of the discarded child.\u201d Davies Adoption Case, supra, at 587, 46 A. 2d at 256.\n\u25a0 - The court below had no alternative but to find as a fact that the natural mother had abandoned her child for longer than the statutory period. To conclude otherwise would have been manifest error.\nDecree affirmed. Each party to pay own costs. .\nAt this point in her direct testimony, she added: \u201cAnd that is what I didn\u2019t want to do. But it seems as though as if I should because we had planned on getting married and the postponement.\u201d\nArrangements for appellant\u2019s stay were made when she and her mother visited the office of the physician in June, 1961. On that occasion, adoptive placement was discussed and planned.\n1925, P. L. 127, \u00a71, as amended, 1 P.S. \u00a71 (1963)."}
