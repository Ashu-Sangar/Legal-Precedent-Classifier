{"id": "1051940", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe mechanic\u2019s lien which the court below struck off was filed against a building and curtilage owned by the appellee, but in the possession of a tenant under lease from him, at the time the heating system was installed by the claimant. The contract for the installation of the system was between the tenant and the claimant alone, and nothing is to be found in the lease from the appellee to his tenant to exempt the claim of the appellant from the requirement of Section 2 of the Act of June 4, 1901, P. L. 4B1, that to be valid it must appear in writing, signed by the landlord, that the \u201cimprovement was in fact made for him for his immediate use and benefit.\u201d This does not appear. On the contrary it appears from the lease between the appellee and the tenant, attached to and made part of appellant\u2019s claim, that the tenant expressly stipulated that in any contract it might make for the installation of a heating system there should be inserted a clause waiving the contractor\u2019s right to file a mechanic\u2019s lien. The right of the appellee to the relief given him by the court below was so clear that it could not have hesitated to strike off the lien, and its order doing so is affirmed, at the costs of the appellant."}
