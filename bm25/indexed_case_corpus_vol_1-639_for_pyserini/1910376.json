{"id": "1910376", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nIn response to a complaint in equity filed by the District Attorney of Philadelphia County, the court of common pleas of that county held a hearing to determine whether the book \u201cCandy\u201d was obscene within the meaning of the Act of June 1, 1956, P. L. (1955) 1997, as amended, September 22, 1961, P. L. 1587, 18 P.S. \u00a73832.1 and the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\nA hearing on the district attorney\u2019s complaint was held in March 1965, but the court below withheld its adjudication pending the disposition by the Supreme Court of the United States of three obscenity cases then on appeal to that Court. On June 9, 1966, the\ncourt below, obviously frustrated because the long awaited decisions did not materially ease its task, found \u201cCandy\u201d to be an obscene publication within the meaning of the Pennsylvania Act and hence not entitled to the protection of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. See Roth v. United Statesy 354 U.S. 476, 77 S. Ct. 1304 (1957). Exceptions were filed but they were overruled by the court en bane. The Dell Publishing Company, and the five additional defendants in the action below, have appealed from the issuance of a permanent injunction enjoining the sale and distribution of \u201cCandy\u201d in Philadelphia County.\nWe reverse, for the reasons stated hereinafter, because we conclude that the court below erroneously interpreted the standards for determining obscenity set forth by the Supreme Court of the United States and, in particular, viewed the book from a perspective inconsistent with these opinions. Our decision in this case, however, should not, in any manner, be construed as an approval of \u201cCandy\u201d \u2014 indeed some members of this Court personally find the book to be revolting and disgusting. While we respect the views of those who believe this book is \u201cobscene\u201d we hold it does not fall within the class of \u201clegal obscenity\u201d so that, in a free society, its circulation may be indiscriminately prohibited.\nThe Constitution has thrust upon the judiciary the obligation of acting as a Board of Censors which requires us to consider each challenged work on a case-by-case basis. Yet in approaching this arduous and unpleasant task we must be mindful of our inherent limitations. For as Mr. Justice Douglas has reminded us, \u201cwe are judges, not literary experts or historians or philosophers. We are not competent to render an independent judgment as to the worth of this or any other book, except in our capacity as private citizens. ... If there is to be censorship, the wisdom of experts on such matters as literary merit and historical significance must be evaluated . . . [and a conclusion reached] irrespective of whether we would include [the challenged work] in our own libraries.\u201d The necessity of such an approach was articulated by Judge Moore of the Second Circuit in an opinion holding, largely on the basis of expert testimony, that, despite his obvious adverse reaction, the Swedish Film \u201c491\u201d was not constitutionally obscene: \u201cI [Judge Moore] personally found \u201849 F repulsive and revolting. . . . Were I to be vested with dictatorial powers, I would ban and destroy the trash (in my opinion) which infests the news kiosks and the movie theatres in certain areas of New York City. I would do all this in the vainglorious belief that I was acting as a Beneficent Tyrant for the good of all Mankind. But the very utterance of these thoughts is more than sufficient reason to shy away from censorship except in extreme cases. If we are to survive, we should probably survive on the Darwinian theory which should include the ability to cope with our current books, stage and cinema.\u201d\nIn the instant litigation, however, both the comments made during the hearing and the formal adjudication indicate that the hearing judge proceeded on the premise that, in the final analysis, his own subjective reaction, in and by itself, was the determining factor. As the law of obscenity now stands the judge\u2019s subjective analysis is of course relevant to the ultimate issue, but the mere donning of judicial robes does not make us the embodiment of the \u201caverage person\u201d nor do our tastes necessarily parallel those of the \u201ccontemporary community.\u201d\nThe totally subjective approach adopted by the court below was palpable error. \u201cThe suppression of a book requires not only an expression of judgment by the court that it is so bad, in the view of the Judges, that it is offensive to community standards of decency as the Legislature has laid them down, but also that it is so bad that the constitutional freedom to print has been lost because of what the book contains. The history and tradition of our institutions stand against the suppression of books.\u201d Larkin v. G. P. Putnam\u2019s Sons, 14 N.Y. 2d 399, 401, 200 N.E. 2d 760, 761 (1964).\nConstitutional fact finding is an essential element of any obscenity case because \u201call ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance \u2014 unorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion \u2014 have the full protection of [constitutional] guaranties, unless excludable because they encroach upon the limited area of more important interests.\u201d Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 484, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1309 (1957). But, the Roth Court continued, \u201cimplicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance.\u201d Ibid. Thus the determination that a book is obscene carries with it the conclusion that the book is not speech within the meaning of the First Amendment.\nHowever, the last quoted sentence from Roth is logically circular and can be interpreted in either of two ways. On the one hand, one can conclude, as do Justices Clark and White, that obscenity by definition has no redeeming social importance. On the other hand, Justice Brennan believes that a work which has even a minimum of social importance is by definition not obscene, a view shared by Chief Justice Warren and Justice Fortas. Since Justices Black, Douglas and Stewart believe that the Brennan approach is too restrictive, we must accept the Brennan analysis as \u201csettled law\u201d with respect to obscenity vel non, at least until five members of the Court agree on a new definition. This is because simple arithmetic shows that the votes of the \u201cBrennan block\u201d along with that of the \u201cBlack-Douglas-Stewart axis\u201d will, of necessity, result in a finding that the work, in the absence of pandering, is entitled to constitutional protection.\nThe impact of Mr. Justice Brennan\u2019s analysis means that in determining the constitutional fact of obscenity vel non the evidence must be viewed in a light favorable to the book\u2019s circulation. As we read his opinions in Roth and Memoirs, any other approach would not provide first amendment freedoms with the necessary \u201cbreathing space to survive.\u201d NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433, 83 S. Ct. 328, 338 (1963). Compare, Monaghan, Obscenity, 1966: The Marriage of Obscenity Per Se and Obscenity Per Quod, 76- Yale L.J. 127, 150-55 (1966).\nFinally, before turning to the evidence presented in' the instant case, it should be pointed out that neither Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S. Ct. 942 (1966), nor Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502, 86 S. Ct. 958 (1966), decided the same day as Memoirs, is, as the court below recognized, relevant to the case at bar. In Ginzburg a majority of the Court adopted the variable approach to obscenity which had long been advocated by Mr. Chief Justice Warren. The Court proceeded on the assumption that the materials in question were not themselves obscene (indeed it all but conceded this point) but held that Ginzburg\u2019s method of \u201cpandering\u201d his wares made them obscene. In Mishkin the defendant\u2019s conduct, rather than the materials themselves, was also the focus of the Court\u2019s concern. Moreover, Mishkin\u2019s sole contention regarding the nature of his books was not their obscenity vel non but rather whether the prurient appeal of the work was to be judged in terms of its effect on the average person or is to be assessed in terms of its effect on the members of the \u201cintended and probable recipient group.\u201d\nNo evidence whatsoever was presented at the proceedings below concerning the conduct of the present appellants. The procedural posture of this case is identical with that of Memoirs, for in both instances it was the book which was on trial. In his opening sentence in the Memows opinion, Mr. Justice Brennan emphasized the crucial importance this difference made when he pointedly said: \u201cThis is an obscenity case in which [\u201cFanny Hill\u201d] was adjudged obscene in a proceeding that put on trial the book itself, and not its publisher or distributor.\u201d 383 IT.S. at 415, 86 S. Ct. at 975. And as in Memoirs, it does not necessarily follow from our holding in this case \u201cthat a determination that [\u201cCandy\u201d] is obscene in the constitutional sense would be improper under all circumstances,\u201d see id. at 420, 86 S. Ct. at 978.\nCandy and the Roth-Memoirs Test\nFor our purpose a lengthy description of \u201cCandy\u201d is unnecessary. It is sufficient to note that the plot is devoted almost exclusively to the normal and abnormal sexual adventures of its heroine, a coed named Candy Christian, and that these adventures are described in considerable detail. Every one of its 15 chapters centers around a particular sexual incident in the heroine\u2019s life. It is generally conceded, by the book\u2019s friends and foes, that it is a satire or at least an attempt at satire upon the cultural ideals of our contemporary society.\nRoth, defines obscenity in the following terms, which incidentally are identical with the definition given in 18 P.S. \u00a73833: \u201c[WJhether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\u201d 354 U.S. 476, 489, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1311 (1957). \u201cUnder this definition, as elaborated in subsequent cases, three elements must coalesce: it must be established that (a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value.\u201d Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413, 418, 86 S. Ct. 975, 977 (1966) (Bkennan, J.). Keeping in mind that \u201cCandy\u201d must meet each of the above mentioned tests before it can be declared legally obscene, we shall consider separately the evidence adduced below on each of the three elements.\nA. Appeal to Prurient Interest: This is perhaps the most difficult of the three elements to define; what appeals to the prurient interest of one individual may not appeal to the prurient interest of another. Some cases may pose a problem of group definition, but it is conceded that \u201cCandy\u2019s\u201d appeal is to the community at large and thus we must judge its prurient appeal to the \u201caverage person.\u201d\nUnfortunately, there was practically no testimony offered concerning \u201cCandy\u2019s\u201d appeal to the prurient interest of the average adult citizen. Most of the Common wealth\u2019s witnesses, as well as the judge himself, were primarily concerned with the book\u2019s adverse effect on children, teenagers, and emotionally unstable individuals, a point which is generally conceded by the defense. At the same time some of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses conceded that the book\u2019s prurient appeal to the emotionally mature adult would be de minimis at most.\nOver half a century ago Judge Learned Hand spoke out against the then prevailing test of obscenity, derived from Regina v. Hicklin, [1868] 3 Q.B. 360, which judged a work in terms of its effect on the most susceptible recipient group: \u201cTo put thought in leash to the average conscience of the time is perhaps tolerable, but to fetter it by the necessities of the lowest and least capable seems a fatal policy.\u201d United States v. Kennerley, 209 Fed. 119, 121 (S.D.N.Y. 1913). The HiekUn test has been subsequently rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States and the one advocated by Judge Hand substituted therefor. See Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S. Ct. 1304 (1957); Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 84 S. Ct. 1676 (1964); Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 160, 169, 80 S. Ct. 215, 222, 227 (1959) (Frankfurter and Harlan, JJ., concurring). This does not mean that society may not by carefully drawn statutes prevent juveniles from obtaining literature which may have an adverse effect on them. See Commonwealth v. Robin, 421 Pa. 70, 72, 218 A. 2d 546, 547 (1966) (concurring opinion); cf. Redrup v. New York, 386 U.S. 767, 87 S. Ct. 1414 (1967). But to destroy literature solely because of its possible effect on the children, and thus \u201creduce the adult population ... to reading only what is fit for children,\u201d is surely, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter observed, \u201cto burn the house to roast the pig.\u201d See Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383, 77 S. Ct. 524, 526 (1957), holding that Michigan could not constitutionally prevent any circulation of a book merely because of its potential deleterious influence on youth. Cf. Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 465 n.3, 86 S. Ct. 942, 944 n.3 (1966). Thus, in the absence of any attempt to prohibit \u201cCandy\u2019s\u201d sales to children, the testimony concerning its effect on children was largely irrelevant.\nNevertheless, we shall assume that the Commonwealth has adequately shown that \u201cthe dominant theme . . . taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex.\u201d This area is one where a judge\u2019s subjective reaction is most relevant; the hearing judge, the court en banc below, and the members of this Court agree that \u201cCandy\u201d has the requisite prurient appeal.\nB. Contemporary Community Standards: Before a finding of legal obscenity can be sustained the evidence must show that \u201cthe material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters.\u201d Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. at 418, 86 S. Ct. at 977 (1966); see Commonwealth v. Baer, 209 Pa. Superior Ct. 349, 227 A. 2d 915 (1967); cf. Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day, 370 U.S. 478, 82 S. Ct. 1432 (1962) (Harlan, J.). Most of the debate over the term \u201ccontemporary community standards\u201d has centered around the question of whether the relevant community is to be defined in terms of the nation-at-large or some smaller sector. Compare Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 84 S. Ct. 1676 (1964) (Brennan, J.) with id. at 199, 84 S. Ct. at 1684 (War-ken, C. J., dissenting). However, since the instant case arose out of Philadelphia County, one of the nation\u2019s more sophisticated areas, the resolution of this debate is not essential to our disposition. Cf. Commonwealth v. Baer, supra at 353 n.3, 227 A. 2d at 918 n.3.\nOne aspect of obscenity litigation in which the Supreme Court seems to be unanimous is that contemporary community standards are to be judged by the standards of the current year rather than by the standards of 5, 10, 50, or 100 years ago. See Jacobellis v. Ohio, supra; Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 160, 169, 80 S. Ct. 215, 222, 227 (1959) (Frankfurter and Harlan, JJ. concurring). This is also the test of The American Law Institute Model Penal Code which has been cited with approval by the Court in Both and subsequent cases. Indeed the Commonwealth\u2019s brief, which devotes less than one hundred words to the contemporary community standards problem, conceded this point.\nThere are two yardsticks by which contemporary community standards may be judged. One is to compare the challenged book to other books which have either been held entitled to the protection of the First Amendment or, in the absence of litigation, which meet contemporary standards and are substantially similar to the challenged book. The other is to consider the reception the book received from the community when it was released. Regardless of our own personal views, under either test, the undisputed evidence clearly demonstrates that the court below erred when it concluded that \u201cCandy\u201d went far beyond customary limits of candor.\nThe Commonwealth presented practically no evidence whatsoever concerning \u201cCandy\u2019s\u201d relationship to contemporary community standards. While its witnesses testified that in their personal view \u201cCandy\u201d far exceeded customary limits of candor, they admitted being totally unfamiliar with contemporary fiction. Two of the witnesses had indeed read \u201cTropic of Cancer,\u201d but despite a clear Supreme Court holding to the contrary they continued to believe the book ought to be banned. While we respect these personal opinions, it does indicate that their views of contemporary standards' differ markedly from those of the Supreme Court.\n\u25a0-1 On - the contrary, the defense witnesses showed considerable familiarity with contemporary erotic literature. They testified that while \u201cCandy\u201d might have exceeded customary limits of candor in the early 1960\u2019s it did not exceed them when published in 1964. In comparing \u201cCandy\u201d to other allegedly obscene books, one witness described it as a \u201cfairy tale\u201d when compared with William Borroughs\u2019 \u201cNaked Lunch\u201d and another found it to be a far superior book to \u201cFanny Hill\u201d. which he described as \u201cpurely pornographic junk.\u2019,\u2019 Both these books, in litigation concluded subsequent to this testimony, have been held not to be legally obscene.\n.. When \u201cCandy\u201d was first published in this country it was reviewed in over a hundred newspapers and periodicals, many of which were introduced by the defense in the proceedings below. While many of these reviews panned the book and some showed utter distaste for it, almost without exception, they recognized it as a serious attempt at satire, and again almost without exception, concluded it was not pornography. Typical of these reviews were those published in the mass media magazines of \u201cLife,\u201d \u201cNewsweek,\u201d and \u201cTime,\u201d excerpts of which we have reprinted in Appendix A. In addition, within a relatively short time following its publication \u201cCandy\u201d sold over two and a half million copies in the hard cover edition and appeared on the New York Times Best Seller List for 35 weeks; during this period sales in Philadelphia department stores reflected the book\u2019s popularity. For two weeks during September 1964 it was the number two best seller in the nation. Since most, if not all, of the books discussed in the last part of this opinion, which have been held not to be legally obscene, are never reviewed and never approach the best seller category, \u201cCandy\u2019s\u201d reception by the American press and public is highly significant.\nC. Redeeming Social Importance: Following the conclusion of the \u201cFanny Hill\u201d litigation, in which the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts was reversed by the Supreme Court of the United States, the Massachusetts Court had occasion to consider the obscenity vel non of William Borroughs\u2019 \u201cNaked Lunch.\u201d Although to the Court the book was \u201cgrossly offensive\u201d and was \u201cwhat the author himself says, \u2018brutal, obscene and disgusting,\u2019 \u201d it nevertheless held in a per curiam opinion that the book was protected by the First Amendment: \u201cAs to whether the book has any redeeming social value, the record contains many reviews and articles in literary and other publications discussing seriously this controversial book portraying the hallucinations of a drug addict. Thus it appears that a substantial and intelligent group in the community believes the book to be of some literary significance. Although we are not bound by the opinions of others concerning the book, we cannot ignore the serious acceptance of it by so many persons in the literary community. Hence, we cannot say that \u2018Naked Lunch\u2019 has no \u2018redeeming social importance in the hands of those who publish or distribute it on the basis of that value.\u2019 See the Memoirs case at p. 421 [86 S. Ct. at p. 979].\u201d Attorney General v. A Book Named \u201cNaked Lunch\u201d, 351 Mass. 298, 299, 218 N.E. 2d 571-72 (1966).\nFrom what has been said in the section under contemporary community standards it should be evident that \u201cCandy\u201d has at least a minimum or modicum of social value, which is all that is required, absent evidence of pandering, to shield a book with the protection of ' the First Amendment. For, as Mr. Justice 'Brennan stated in Memoirs, 383 U.S. at 419, 86 S. Ct. at 978 (emphasis in original) : \u201cA book cannot be proscribed unless it' is found to be utterly without redeeming social value. This is so even though the book is found to possess the requisite prurient appeal and to be patently offensive. Each of the three federal constitutional criteria is to be applied independently; the social value of the book can neither be weighed against- nor canceled by its prurient appeal or patent offensiveness.\u201d\n\u25a0In addition, several of the Commonwealth\u2019s own witnesses\u2019 testimony indicates that \u201cCandy\u201d has a. \u201cmodicum\u201d of social value, although they felt this value is far outweighed by the book\u2019s decadence and that its impact is destructive rather than constructive. One witness, for example, conceded that \u201cCandy\u201d was a \u201creputed spoof on sex\u201d and admitted that many emotionally mature adults, although not the \u201caverage person\u201d would so view it. Another witness stated that \u201cCandy\u2019s\u201d authors \u201cintended to portray a philosophy of life\u201d in which sex was glorified as a way of life, \u201ca standard of living that should be embraced by all, disregard [sic] for any discipline whatsoever.\u201d A third who felt \u201csex is dynamite\u201d and \u201cnot something to play with or joke about\u201d viewed the book as a \u201cslander against proper authority.\u201d Yet the essence of the First Amendment is the protection of free advocacy of ideas \u2014\u201cunorthodox ideas, controversial ideas, even ideas hateful to the prevailing climate of opinion,\u201d Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 484, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1309 (1957)\u2014and a book may not be banned simply because it is ideologically obscene. See Kingsley International Pictures Corp. v. Regents of the State University of New York, 360 U.S. 684, 79 S. Ct. 1362 (1959).\nTbe \u201cmodicum\u201d of social importance which saved \u201cFanny Hill\u201d was that: \u201cthere was expert testimony, much of which was strained, to the effect that Memoirs is a structural novel with literary merit; that the book displays a skill in characterization and a gift for comedy; that it plays a part in the history of the development of the English novel; and that it contains a moral, namely, that sex with love is superior to sex in a brothel.\u201d Attorney General v. A Book named \u201cJohn Cleland\u2019s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure,\u201d 349 Mass. 69, 73, 206 N.E. 2d 403, 406 (1965), quoted in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. at 419, 86 S. Ct. at 977-78. The expert testimony in the instant case went at. least as far. Indeed the trial court\u2019s own evaluation of the testimony offered at the proceeding below is the best evidence that the court did not adh\u00e9re to the standards or approach outlined above: \u201cSummed up, the Commonwealth\u2019s testimony comprises in the main personal judgments of witnesses, with merely a dash of measurement against contemporary literature, that \u2018Candy\u2019 is a \u2018dirty book\u2019; while the defense testimony is a rather more erudite assessment of the book as a satire possessed of social importance. Under the law as we piece it together, however, we do not regard the testimony of witnesses either way as binding on \u2022the Court. The assessment of a book by those testifying is a guide and an aid to the Court, more or less valuable and persuasive as the apparent knowledge and stature of the individual witness merits. The judge may not be motivated solely by his personal predilections but must strive as far as possible to be objective. Yet in his final wrestling with his soul he cannot put aside entirely his subjective determination. He must read the book himself, take into account the views of witnesses and the reviews of critics and the arguments of counsel, and then ultimately come up with his own reaction to his reading. Despite the impressive testimony of the defense witnesses, despite the prodigious diligence of the defense counsel in marshaling precedents and arguments, our conclusion is definitely and unequivocally that \u2018Candy\u2019 is legally obscene.\u201d It is thus evident that the court below considered only the first of three sine qua non elements set forth in Memoirs.\nObscenity Litigation During the October 1966 Term\nOne constant aspect of obscenity litigation in the Supreme Court of the United States during the past decade seems to be that action speaks louder than words. Thus the convictions of Messrs. Mishkin and Ginzburg were upheld more because of wbat they did than because of what they published. Moreover, although a majority of the Court has yet to agree on a precise test for determining obscenity, their summary reversal of a number of cases during the term just completed does provide some guide to the ultra-prag matic approach the Court is taking in this area. Significantly, the Court has yet to find a published work obscene per se.\nOn May 8, 1967, without the fanfare of its 1966 trilogy, the Court handed down a cryptic per curiam opinion disposing of three consolidated cases, Redrup v. New York, 386 U.S. 767, 87 S. Ct. 1414, which may yet prove to be the most significant of its obscenity opinions. The impact of this opinion, along with those cases summarily decided on the last day of the Term, comes as close to a holding that, in the eyes of the present Court, \u201cCandy\u201d is not per se constitutionally obscene as is possible without a direct ruling on the bock itself. Although the Court had originally granted review in Redrup to consider problems of scienter upon the assumption that the materials involved were obscene in the constitutional sense, it decided to dispose of the case upon the ground that they were not obscene under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The Court noted that while it was badly split concerning the precise definition of obscenity, each of the seven justices who reached the merits agreed that under their individual approaches the materials were not legally obscene. Involved in the cases decided by Redrwp were two paperbacks, \u201cLust Pool\u201d and \u201cShame Agent\u201d, and ten so-called \u201cgirlie\u201d magazines such as \u201cHigh Heels\u201d, \u201cGent\u201d, and \u201cSwank.\u201d\nRedrup seems to signify the Court\u2019s final abandonment of its futile search for a definition of obscenity vel non. For significantly, instead of attempting to determine what constituted obscenity, the Court approached the problem in terms of those circumstances under which the publication of otherwise unobjectionable material might be constitutionally restricted, 87 S. Ct. at 1415: \u201cIn none of the cases was there a claim that the statute in question reflected a specific and limited state concern for juveniles. See Prince v. Commonwealth of Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 64 S. Ct. 438, 88 L. Ed. 645; cf. Butler v. State of Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 77 S. Ct. 524, 1 L. Ed. 2d 412. In none was there any suggestion of an assault upon individual privacy by publication in a manner so obtrusive as to make it impossible for an unwilling individual to avoid exposure to it. Cf. Breard v. City of Alexandria, 341 U.S, 622, 71 S. Ct. 920, 95 L. Ed. 1233; Public Utilities Comm\u2019n of District of Columbia v. Pollak, 343 U.S. 451, 72 S. Ct. 813, 96 L. Ed. 1068. And in none was there evidence of the sort of \u2018pandering\u2019 which the Court found significant in Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S. Ct. 942, 16 L. Ed. 2d 31.\u201d\nAs has already been indicated in this opinion, none of the three situations described in Redrup are present in the case at bar. The importance of Redrup to obscenity litigation in general, and to the instant case in. particular., is amply demonstrated by eleven decisions handed down by the Court on the last day of the 1966 Term, June 12, 1967. In each case the Court granted certiorari and summarily reversed an obscenity conviction citing Redrup as its sole authority. In other words, none of the materials involved in these litigations was, in the Court\u2019s view, obscene in the constitutional sense. Thus Redrup suggests that the Court en banc and each of the individual judges have adopted an \u201cI know it when I see it\u201d test for obscenity. Nevertheless, a glance at the type of books held to be protected under Redrup\u2019s aegis clearly demonstrates the divergence between the Supreme Court\u2019s utilization of a subjective analysis and that indulged in by tbe court below.\nBecause of the wide difference of opinion on the Supreme Court, perhaps the only way to obtain a sense for the Court\u2019s attitude qua Court is to consider the views of each individual Justice. A breakdown of the individual votes in the eleven Redrup related cases reveals the following: Justices Black, Douglas and Stewart predictably voted to reverse in each instance, but so did Justices White and Fortas. Justice Brennan voted to reverse the convictions in seven cases, to affirm two cases (both involving movies) without giving any reason, and to affirm one case on the authority of Ginzburg and to vacate and remand one case on the authority of Memoirs. Chief Justice Warren voted to reverse in two cases, to affirm in two cases (both involving movies) without giving any reason, to affirm two cases on the authority of Mishhin and one on the authority of Ginzburg, to vacate and remand one case in light of Memoirs, and to set down three cases for oral argument. Justice Clark voted to reverse in two cases, to affirm in five cases without giving his reasons, to affirm two cases on the authority of Mish kin and one on tbe authority of Ginzburg and to set down one case for oral argument. Justice Harlan voted to reverse all cases coming from the federal courts and to affirm all those coming from state courts.\nNone of the published works involved in the Redrup related cases comes close to having achieved the national recognition afforded \u201cCandy.\u201d Indeed, to our knowledge, none of them were reviewed in any publication and none certainly appeared on any best seller lists. Moreover, the reported opinions of the lower courts indicate tliat no serious attempt was made to defend them on the ground of redeeming social importance. We can only conclude therefore that under both Redrup and the Rolh-Memoirs test the court below erred in finding \u201cCandy\u201d constitutionally obscene.\nDecree reversed; each party to pay own costs.\nMr. Justice Jones, Mr. Justice Eagen and Mr. Justice O\u2019Brien join in this opinion of the Court.\nMr. Justice Cohen took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nAppendixes to the Opinion op the Court :\nAppendix A\nExcerpts from three reviews of \u201cCandy\u201d:\n1. Life Magazine, May 8, 1964. (A signed review by Nelson Algren, American author) : \u201cI don\u2019t know how reviewers reacted to Alice in Wonderland when it first was published. Something, I suspect, along the same lines as the Navy brass when first confronted with Admiral Rickover\u2019s fantasies. I do know how the professional critics ducked when Joseph Heller\u2019s Catch 22 was published: and that it took a great wave of praise from England to force it upon their frighted sightlines. So far Terry Southern has suffered the same fate in this country.\n\u201cOne understands that, like Alice reproaching Humpty-Dumpty for the way he is holding her notebook, Candy too is saying, \u2018You\u2019re holding it upside-down !\u2019 Candy is telling us that, in our insistence that sex is something foul, we are holding love upside-down. Southern\u2019s sense of the wildly comic disguises the fact that there is no more serious writer in the U.S. today than himself.\n\u201cThe awkward truth he presents is that sex is not sick, but innocent. And worse yet to reviewers\u2014 Southern is an absolutely first-rate writer. So now the whole bicycling throng of literary begrudgers, too obsequious to oppose yet too chintzy to praise, too canny to hate and too careful to love, will have to pedal like mad to fit Southern to some acceptable preconception.\n\u201c\u2018He\u2019s like Nathanael West!\u2019 is sure to be one guess. \u2018No! he\u2019s Lenny Bruce!\u2019 another will insist. \u2018Hey! How about \u201cA Beat Dean Swift\u201d?\u2019 yet another may venture. \u2018Not at all! He\u2019s a combination of Orwell, Burroughs, Joe Heller and Evelyn Waugh.\u2019 None of which will be accurate. Nor will - the inevitable comparisons to Henry Miller. Miller fought the tyranny of puritanical sex with puritanical fury. But two generations have passed since then, and it is possible to be more lighthearted about such matters today. The Magic Christian, Candy and Dr. Strangelove are the work of a major satirist. Furthermore, each are' aspects of the same novel. In short, Southern is holding up a triple-angled mirror to America in which, given a rudimentary sense of humor, we are enabled to see ourselves as we really are.\n\u201cNowhere has sex been sicker than in the U.S., and sick for so long we have forgotten it is supposed to be-healthy. When sex is a joyous fulfillment instead of a wasting affliction, people can see that the most hilarious event in the history of mankind was the division of the sexes. That is what Southern sees; and that is what Candy says.\u201d\n2. Time Magazine, June 12, 1964: \u201cSince pornography is now available at every neighborhood bookshop and drugstore, the idea of satirizing the pornographic novel was bound to occur to someone. If done with Swiftian skill, it could be defended on moral as well as literary grounds, even though it could easily descend to the level of a vice crusader\u2019s wet-lipped discourse on the evils of vice.\n\u201cCandy is as far from Swift as a French postcard is from Hogarth. Its heroine, Candy Christian, is that supposedly fictitious character \u2014 the girl who was ruined by a book. A glad-glanded college girl, she believes everything she reads or is told, and thus her pretty head is filled with every clich\u00e9 in the current liberal establishment of ideas. Unhappily there is just one thing she can do for her country, for colonial freedom, for Zen enlightenment, for Freud, for minorities, and this she certainly does. For example, she takes the most improbable of her lovers, a cretin with a \u2018radish-white\u2019 humped back, because he is so loathsome that he constitutes a superminority of one.\n\u201cCandy, originally written for Paris\u2019 Olympia Press, which specializes in sheer lubricity, is not pornography. It may even be described as antisexual; all too often, at the crucial moment, everything goes askew, and Candy slips back into her flimsy panties, crying \u2018Good grief!\u2019 Its most conspicuous intent is to be more outrageous in detail than what it is satirizing, and these days, that is hard to do. In the effort, Candy ends up dirty as hell.\u201d\n3. Newsweek Magazine, May 18, 1964: \u201cStand aside. Franny and Zooey; the age of Hadj and Zoon is upon us. The new era promises to be a good deal more scatological than the old, and, to be quite honest about it, a lot more fun.\n\u201cEager: The form of the story is episodic, like Voltaire\u2019s \u2018Candide,\u2019 which the heroine\u2019s name, Candy Christian, purposely recalls. But she is a very up-to-date heroine, peachy, pneumatic, and eager for defloration and all sorts of debauchery, which she is able to accept in good conscience as service to others as well as mystical self-realization.\n\u201c \u2018To give oneself \u2014 fully\u2014-is not merely a duty prescribed by an outmoded superstition,\u2019 the prurient Professor Mephesto assures her over an aphrodisiac sherry in his study, \u2018it is a beautiful and thrilling privilege!\u2019 After privileged encounters with libidinous doctors and a cretinous hunchback, Candy attains the esoteric ca-' maraderie of the Cracker Foundation, a progressive coal mine like some sort of underground kibbutz, near Mohawk, Minn. From there, inflamed by a lecherously demanding guru (\u2018. . . the mystic path is an arduous path . . .\u2019), she undertakes a pilgrimage to Tibet and what must surely be the most marvelously scabrous denouement in modern letters \u2014 the climax of a G-reek tragedy rewritten by Nathanael West and S. J. Perelman.\n\u201cThe stylistic mixture sounds fantastic, and it is. It also sounds uncomfortably lumpy, and yet, surprisingly, it isn\u2019t. Although, the two authors write alternately, the texture is remarkably even, and Southern gave the whole script a final fond erotic polish.\u201d\nAppendix B\nFor purposes of comparison with the reviews excerpted in Appendix A (see also notes 30, 44, 47 and accompanying text) we have included the Court of Appeals\u2019 description of \u201cSex Life of A Cop\u201d, held not constitutionally obscene in Aday v. United States, 388 U.S. 447, 87 S. Ct. 2095 (1967). The description appears in United States v. West Coast News Co., 357 F. 2d 855, 857-58 (6th Cir. 1966) : \u201cWe will not attempt illumination by extensive recital of the book\u2019s contents. This short description will suffice. Sex Life of A Cop is a paperback with a cover picturing a woman (the wife of the Mayor of the town) trying unsuccessfully to hide her nakedness behind the grotesque, underwear-clad figure of the town\u2019s Chief of Police, both of them having been interrupted in their lovers\u2019 lane dalliance by two of the town\u2019s police officers. The latter pair are the heroes of the narrative. Their discovery of the Chief and his lady was not the product of zeal to enforce the law, but of their effort to beguile the monotony of their round of duty by such surprise intrusions.\n\u201cInside the covers are pages which the defendants\u2019 experts call \u2018blurbs\u2019. These are short, but meaty, excerpts from other books available from the publishers, and give prurient promise of the books\u2019 contents. They demonstrate that the publisher, at least, suffered from no illusions as to the interests to which the book was directed. One of the blurbs, however, has an intellectual flavor. It identifies as an author, Wallace DeOrtega Maxey, Doctor of Divinity, whom we assume to be the defendant of the same name. \u2018Dr. Maxey\u2019 is described as a minister who has cast off the shackles of prudery, (now an evangelist for freedom) whose \u2018views are in sharp contrast with those of most ministers, but so were the views of Columbus with those of the other navigators of his time. The new idea replaces the old; the world is not flat.\u2019\n\u201cThe 147 pages of the alleged novel are generously faithful to the promises of the blurbs. Without palliating interruption, the story moves quickly from one sexual enterprise to another. So numerous are these events that even the practiced skill of the author runs out of fresh imagery and dully repeats his supply of leering adjectives. The chief actors are a police sergeant and his fellow occupant of the appropriately named, \u2018prowl car\u2019. These officers, except for some needed. rest from their amours, devote most of their on-duty and off-duty hours to successful sex encounters with whatever females come within their view. Their conquests range from a virgin to a \u2018100 dollar\u2019 prostitute, The wives of the Chief of Police and the Mayor of the town, the new female police dispatcher, friendly waitresses, two nurses who promptly take off their clothes when the busy officers, otherwise unheralded, climb through their open window, a drunken \u2018society\u2019 lady who is first rescued from a corner lamppost and then raped in the back seat of the prowl car, and a miscellany of other willing ladies, make up the east. Every female identified in the story is easy prey for the officers. With their husbands away, some married ladies gain the officers\u2019 sexual services by false night calls to the police dispatcher complaining of a \u2018prowler.\u2019 Chivalrous response by the prowl car is rewarded by amorous receptions. Even the wife of his fellow officer is not overlooked by Sergeant Thorne. The drama concludes with a smashing denouement when the sergeant discovers, as an eyewitness, that his own beloved Alice has been enjoying his outranked, prowl-car-pal\u2019s offerings. The moral lesson of retribution, which defendants\u2019 experts claim gives this book a social value, subtly emerges in the cuckolded sergeant\u2019s plaintive soliloquy \u2018What in the world have I ever done to deserve this?\u2019 Thus ends the play.\u201d\nThe Act of June 1, 1956, P. L. (1955) 1997, as amended, 18 P.S. \u00a73832.1 provides: \u201cThe district attorney of any county in which any person sells, distributes, . . . any comic book, magazine, book, . . . which is obscene, may institute proceedings in equity in the court of common pleas of said county for the purpose of enjoining [its] sale, resale ....

The conduct of the defendant is the central issue, not the obscenity of a book or picture.

A wholly different result might be reached in a different setting.\u201d Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 495, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1314-15 (1957) (Wabben, C. X, concurring). See. Ginzburg v.

New York, 383 U.S. 502, 509, 86 S. Ct. 958, 964 (1966). \u201cCandy\u2019s\u201d audience was the community-at-large rather than a deviate sector as in Mishkin.\n-vye recognize of course that the instant litigation was instituted against \u201cCandy\u2019s\u201d publisher and distributor. However, the whole focus of 18 P.S. \u00a73832.1 is upon the book itself and it clearly was the book, not the publisher or distributor, which was on trial. Cf. Kingsley Books, Inc. v. Brown, 354 U.S. 436, 77 S. Ct. 1325 (1957). No evidence was introduced below which even alluded to any other issue. Nor was there any suggestion that any of the defendants went about their business with \u201cthe leer of the sensualist\u201d or made any statements remotely similar to those made by defendants Mishkin and Ginzburg which proved so decisive in their respective appeals.\nThe Commonwealth in its brief does attempt to bring \u201cCandy\u201d within the Ginzburg-Mishlevn pandering rationale but its arguments on this point border on the absurd. First it suggests that the appellants were guilty of pandering because \u201cCandy\u201d was also sold in a paperback edition. The Ginzburg Court itself emphatically rejected the equation of profit with pandering, 383 U.S. at 474-75, 86 S. Ct. at 949. See also Redrup v. New York, 386 U.S. 767, 87 S. Ct. 1414 (1967) (involving paperback publications). Secondly, the Commonwealth argues that pandering may be found because one of the defense witnesses advertised \u201cCandy\u201d in a brochure which was \u201cblatantly aimed at an audience solicited to purchase the various books for their prurient interest appeal only.\u201d The man in question, however, was a witness, not a defendant and it was never suggested that any of the defendants were in any way responsible for the advertisement. Moreover, although this brochure did advertise \u201cCandy\u201d and other books which are legitimately classified as erotic literature it also contained advertisements for such books as the \u201cAmerican Everyday Dictionary\u201d and Thoreau\u2019s \u201cWalden.\u201d\nSee, e.g., the dissenting opinions of Justices Black, Douglas and Stewart in Ginzburg v. United States, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S. Ct. 942 (1966).\nE.g., Mishkin v. New York, 383 U.S. 502, 86 S. Ct. 958 (1966): cf. Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day, 370 U.S. 478, 82 S. Ct 1432 (1962).\n\u201cPredominant appeal shall be judged with reference to ordinary adults unless it appears from the character of the material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be designed for children or other specially susceptible audience.\u201d A.L.I.

Brennan and Stewart, have clearly stated that they believe the relevant community is the nation. The votes of Justices White and Fortas in the obscenity cases decided in June 1967, discussed infra, seem to imply that they too have adopted this view.\nA vast number of books, which are now considered classics, were at one time banned. See, e.g., Judge Bok\u2019s list in Commonwealth v. Gordon, 66 Pa. D. & C. 101, 115-17 (1949).\nThis second yardstick will not be available in all instances. See, e.g., the books held to be not constitutionally obscene in Redrup v. Now York, 386 U.S. 767, 87 S. Ct. 1414 (1967) and its progeny discussed infra. See also Commonwealth v. Baer, 209 Pa.

Baer, supra note 25.\n\u2018'Under cross-examination, most of the [Commonwealth\u2019s] witnesses admitted they had read little of the modern outpouring of erotic novels, and hence were not able to compare \u2018Candy\u2019 with other contemporary works of its general kind.\u201d Opinion of the hearing judge, Record p. 380a.\nThe Commonwealth called as its witnesses, Dr. John J.

Ct. at 1365: \u201cIt is contended that the State\u2019s action was justified because the motion picture attractively portrays a relationshij) which is contrary to the moral standards, the religious precepts, and the legal code of its citizenry. This argument misconceives what it is that the Constitution protects. Its guarantee is not confined to the expression of ideas that are conventional or shared by a majority. It protects advocacy of the opinion that adultery may sometimes be proper, no less than advocacy of socialism or the single tax. And in the realm of ideas it protects expression which is eloquent no less than that which is unconvincing.\u201d\nTo demonstrate this, all we need do is quote from the trial judge\u2019s summarization of the two defense witnesses who addressed themselves to the book\u2019s social value: \u201cA Princeton Ph. D., professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania, called it \u2018a work of literature\u2019 \u2014 though, he conceded, not a very good one. It was concerned with- a serious moral and emotional problem, he said \u2014 the idea upheld in our culture of the satisfaction to be found in giving oneself to others, which the book brought into question. It was reasonably funny. He considered \u2018Fanny Hill\u2019 to be outright pornography, and if so \u2018Candy\u2019 was not, he declared.\u201d Opinion of the hearing judge, Record p. 380a.\n\u201cA professor of English literature at Columbia University testified that he considered \u2018Candy\u2019 an important book, not great but significant, in the tradition of Roman satire but presenting a new technique. It had social importance, he said, as a bitter attack on the \u2018specious goodness\u2019 inherent in the false and hypocritical idea of the \u2018American Dream girl\u2019 \u2014 the stereotype of woman as pure, beautiful, wholesome, sweet and devoted to everyone\u2019s welfare but her own. The sex scenes, he said, were not written to arouse sexual desires or to advocate improprieties but rather as caricatures. He did concede, however, that the book might stimulate some young people to improper acts. Nevertheless he believed \u2018Candy\u2019 might very likely be recommended for college reading in a course on modern comic fiction.\u201d Id. at 381a. See also the book review excerpts in Appendix A.\nIn Roth and its companion case, Alberts v. California, the Court proceeded on the assumption, not challenged by the defendants, that the materials involved were properly classified as obscenity, the only issue being whether obscenity was protected by the First Amendment. 354 U.S. at 481 n.8, 77 S. Ct. at 1307 n.8. In Ginsbura, the Court proceeded on the assumption that the materials involved were not constitutionally obscene per se but that the defendant\u2019s conduct made them so. Finally, in Mishkin, the only other case where the Court has written an opinion affirming an obscenity conviction, Mishkin evidently did not challenge the New York Court\u2019s findings that his material consisted of hard-core pornography, but limited his appeal to the question of whether the material appealed to the prurient interest of the average person. See 383 U.S. at 508, 86 S. Ct. at 963.\nJustices Black, Douglas and Stewart would have granted review without any such limitation. See Gent v. Arkansas, 384 U.S. 937, 86 S. Ct. 1454; Redrup v. New York, 384 U.S. 916, 86 S. Ct. 1362 (1966).\nJustices Clark and Harlan objected to the Court\u2019s decision to dispose of the cases on grounds specifically excluded from review.\nTwo other obscenity cases were reversed on non-Redrup grounds, Cornith Publications, Inc. v. Wesberry, 388 U.S. 418, 87 S. Ct. 2096 (1967) and Rosenbloom v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 450, 87 S. Ct. 2095, and two appeals were dismissed as moot, Jacobs v. New York, 388 U.S. 431, 87 S. Ct. 2098, and Tannenbaum v. New York, 388 U.S. 439, 87 S. Ct. 2107.\nSchackman v. California, 388 U.S. 454, 87 S. Ct. 2107 (1967); Mazes v. Ohio, 388 U.S. 453, 87 S. Ct. 2105 (books); Books, Inc. v. United States, 388 U.S. 449, 87 S. Ct. 2098 (books; reversing 1st Cir.); Aday v. United States, 388 U.S. 447, 87 S. Ct. 2095 (books; reversing 6th Cir.); Avansino v. New York, 388 U.S. 446, 87 S. Ct. 2093 (books); Sheperd v. New York, 388 U.S. 444, 87 S. Ct. 2093 (books); Cobert v. New York, 388 U.S. 443, 87 S. Ct. 2092 (movies); Ratner v. California, 388 U.S. 442, 87 S. Ct. 2092 (movies); Friedman v. New York, 388 U.S. 441, 87 S. Ct. 2091 (books); Keney v. New York, 388 U.S. 440, 87 S. Ct. 2091 (books); A Quantity of Books v. Kansas, 388 U.S. 452, 87 S. Ct. 2104 (books).\nJacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 197, 84 S. Ct. 1676, 1683 (1964) (Stewart, J.).\nSee 35 Law Week 3430-31 (June 13, 1967) for a summary of the issues raised in the cases cited notes 41 and 42 supra. Examples of the paperbacks held not to be obscene in the constitutional sense are: \u201cLust Job\u201d, \u201cOrgy Club\u201d, \u201cSex Life of A Cop\u201d, \u201cPassion Priestess\u201d, and \u201cSin Warden.\u201d See especially the description of \u201cSex Life of A Cop\u201d in United States v. West Coast News Co., 357 F. 2d 855, 857-58 (6th Cir. 1966), rev\u2019d sub nom, Aday v. United States, 388 U.S. 447, 87 S. Ct. 2095 (1967), reprinted in Appendix B.\nBecause of his resignation at the end of the 1966 Term, Justice Glabk\u2019s personal views on obscenity may no longer bo important. Moreover, since Justice Clark has been the most conservative member of the Court vis-a-vis obscenity eases, even if his successor were to have the same views, it would have no appreciable effect on the current status of obscenity law.\nSee Justice Harlan\u2019s separate opinion in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413, 455, 86 S. Ct. 975, 996 (1966) and Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 496, 77 S. Ct. 1304, 1315 (1957).\nTwo other cases decided on the last day of the Term, both involving convictions for distributing allegedly obscene movies, deserve passing mention. In one, Wenzler v. Pitchess, 388 U.S. 912, 87 S. Ct. 2096 (1967), the Court simply denied certiorari with Justices Black, Stewart and Douglas noting that they were of the opinion that certiorari should be granted and a writ of habeas corpus issued on the authority of Redrup. In the other case, Landau v. Fording, 388 U.S. 456, 87 S. Ct. 2109 (1967), the Court granted certiorari and affirmed, Justices Portas, Stewart, Douglas and Black noting dissents. Neither the majority nor. dissenting judges cited any authority for their respective votes. The lower court opinion in Landau, 54 Cal. Reptr. 177 (Cal. App. 1966) reveals that the defendant\u2019s conviction was upheld on alternative grounds, viz., that the movie in question was constitutionally obscene and that the defendant was guilty of pandering. Significantly however the court noted an important distinction between obscenity vel non of movies and books: \u201cBecause of the nature of the medium, we think a motion picture of sexual scenes may transcend the bounds of the constitutional guarantee long before a frank description of the same scenes in the written word.\u201d 54 Cal. Reptr. at 181. Of. the votes of Chief Justice Warren and Justice Brennan in the eleven cases reversed on the authority of Redrup.\nFor example, in United States v. West Coast News Co., 228 F. Supp. 171 (W.D. Mich. 1964), aff\u2019d, 357 F. 2d 855 (6th Cir. 1966), rev\u2019d sub nom, Aday v. United States, 388 U.S. 447, 87 S. Ct. 2095 (1967) (\u201cSex Life of A Cop\u201d) (see Appendix B), the defendants argued that the challenged work did not affront contemporary community standards and sought to introduce the following books in support of this contention: \u201cFanny Hill\u201d, \u201cTropic of Capricorn\u201d, \u201cLady Chatterly\u2019s Lover\u201d, \u201cNaked Lunch\u201d, \u201cThe Carpetbaggers\u201d, \u201cCold Wind in August\u201d, \u201cClip Joint Cutie\u201d, and \u201cSin Binge.\u201d The district court refused to admit them, the first six on the ground that they were irrelevant because they were not similar to the book in question, and the last two because, while eoncededly similar, there was no proof they had become acceptable by community standards."}
