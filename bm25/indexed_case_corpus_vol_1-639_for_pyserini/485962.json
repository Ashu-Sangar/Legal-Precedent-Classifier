It is a private corporation for the benefit of its members, as much so as any other beneficial or literary society. It might permit others than members to use the library, but nobody could call it to account for refusing such permission. It is clearly not within the principles settled by the court in Donohugh\u2019s Appeal, 5 Norris 306.\nJudgment affirmed."}
