{"id": "1044552", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal is dismissed, at the costs of the appellant, on the following from the opinion of the learned court below making absolute the rule' to set aside the order of service and the service of the bill: \u201cA careful examination of the amended bill and the prayers based thereon, leads to the conclusion that the present contention is controlled by the ruling of the Supreme Court (Vandersloot v. Pa. W. & P. Co., 259 Pa. 104).
