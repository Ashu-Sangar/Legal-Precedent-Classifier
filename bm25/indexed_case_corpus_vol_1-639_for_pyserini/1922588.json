{"id": "1922588", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nOn June 25, 1962, David E. Shockley was arraigned before the court in Chester County on an indictment charging him with murder. He pleaded \u201cnot guilty\u201d, and a jury was empanelled to hear the relevant testimony and determine his guilt or innocence.\nOn June 27th, after the Commonwealth had introduced the testimony of sixteen witnesses to establish Shockley\u2019s guilt of the crime and had rested its case in chief, Shockley\u2019s counsel requested the permission of the court to withdraw the plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d and enter a plea of guilty to murder in the second degree. At the direction of the trial judge, Shockley then signed a plea of guilty to murder in the second degree on the back of the indictment. Then, in the presence of Shockley and his counsel, the trial judge informed the jury of the change of plea, and explained in detail the legal differences between first degree murder and second degree murder, and stated that after a consideration of the testimony already heard he would accept the plea of guilt offered.\nFollowing that, counsel for Shockley summarized for the court the facts to which Shockley and other defense witnesses would have testified if the case had proceeded to a conclusion. Mr. Stively, one of Shockley\u2019s counsel, then requested permission of the court to ask Shockley some questions, and the following ensued: \u201cBy Mr. Stively: Q. David, have Mr. Pitt and I represented you properly throughout this matter, in your opinion? A. Yes, you have. Q. And have we explained to you the case as we saw it against you and what you had on your side, and as a result, we made a recommendation as to whether or not this plea should be entered, is that a fact? A. Yes, you did. Q. But, David, isn\u2019t it correct, we left the final decision to you since you are the man who will be serving the sentence and we wanted you to voluntarily decide whether you wanted that? A. Yes, beyond all reasonable doubt, you left it up to me. Q. You did, of your own free will enter a plea of guilty? A. Of my own free will voluntarily.\u201d\nSubsequently, Shockley was sentenced to serve imprisonment for a term of 8 to 18 years. No request to withdraw the plea was ever made, nor was an appeal entered from the judgment.\nOn April 4, 1968, Shockley filed a petition seeking post-conviction relief under the Act of January 25, 1966 (1965), P. L. 1580, \u00a71 et seq., 19 P.S. \u00a71180-1. Counsel was appointed to represent him and subsequently the court dismissed the petition without hearing. An appeal from that order is now before us.\nShockley argues that it was error for the court below to dismiss his petition seeking post-conviction relief without giving him a hearing on the following two issues: \u201cA. Did the appellant intelligently and knowingly waive his right to trial when he entered a plea of guilty to the charge of murder? B. Was the plea of guilty primarily motivated by the introduction into evidence of an illegally-obtained confession?\u201d\nIf Shockley did not knowingly and intelligently plead guilty, the plea is a nullity and a new trial would be required. And where this issue is properly raised in a - petition seeking post-conviction relief, a hearing must be held to determine the validity of the plea, unless the record of the plea proceedings clearly demonstrates that the plea was intelligently and knowingly entered. Commonwealth v. Wood, 425 Pa. 612, 230 A. 2d 729 (1967), and Commonwealth v. Stokes, 426 Pa. 265, 232 A. 2d 193 (1967). In the instant case no hearing was required on this question, because the record of the plea proceedings establishes beyond question the validity of the plea and completely refutes Shockley\u2019s present assertion to the contrary. Cf. Act of 1966, supra, \u00a79, 19 P.S. \u00a71180-9.\nThe record also readily discloses that Shockley\u2019s remaining contention that his plea of guilty was primarily motivated by the evidentiary use of an illegally-obtained confession is devoid of merit. First, there is nothing in the record to support the premise that the confession was \u201cillegally obtained\u201d, nor was there the slightest indication by counsel at trial that its validity was questioned. Second, when the confession was offered in evidence, counsel for Shockley responded, \u201cwe have no objection.\u201d Finally, during the plea proceedings while Shockley\u2019s counsel was summarizing for the court the testimony Shockley would have given if called to the stand, he emphasized as an extenuating circumstance Shockley\u2019s cooperation with the police after his arrest, including \u201cvoluntarily\u201d giving a statement of the circumstances incident to the killing.\nIn view of the facts in the record, a hearing was not required on Shockley\u2019s petition.\nOrder affirmed.\nA plea to second degree murder is unknown in Pennsylvania and is contrary to proper practice. However, where the defendant is not prejudiced by the court\u2019s acceptance of such a plea, he may not subsequently attack it on this ground. Commonwealth v. Stokes, 426 Pa. 265, 232 A. 2d 193 (1967)."}
