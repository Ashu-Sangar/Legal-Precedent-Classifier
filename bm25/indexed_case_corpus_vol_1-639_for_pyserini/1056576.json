{"id": "1056576", "contents": "Mr. Justice Woodward\ndelivered the opinion of the court,\nOn the 30th of October 1874, Philip Banker obtained a judgment in the Common Pleas of Luzerne against Jacob Adams for $700. He was the endorser of a note of Adams for the same amount, which had been discounted by the Wyoming National Bank, on the 7th of October, and the judgment was .confessed in order to indemnify him against liability for its payment. The note matured on the 9th of December 1874, and on that day, in the absence of Banker, at the solicitation of Adams, and upon his assurance that Banker\u2019s judgment should be assigned to him for his protection, Robert Baur endorsed a new note of Adams\u2019 for $700, which was received by the bank in lieu of that which Banker had endorsed. This new note was renewed from time to time, and was finally paid by Baur. Banker assigned his judgment to Baur on the 4th of February 1875. In the meantime, on the 7th of December 1874, judgments against Adams were obtained by Webster & Goldsmith Brothers, the appellants. In the distribution the auditor applied the balance of the fund, after payment of earlier liens, pro rata to the judgment of Banker, and to one which had been confessed to Baur, both having been entered the same day. The court confirmed the auditor\u2019s report.\nBanker had no part in the arrangement between Baur and Adams. His judgment had been obtained for a single purpose. It was to protect himself as the endorser of the note that was running in the bank. If that had been paid at maturity, all the uses of the judgment would have been served. So far as Banker was concerned, why was the note not paid when it was cancelled by the renewal ? The judgment was a personal indemnity to him. It was not a collateral or cumulative security to the bank. It had no connection with the debt Adams owed, except that it had grown out of it as an independent contract. When the note of the 9th of December was accepted, the discharge of Banker from all obligation as an endorser was absolute, and with that discharge why were not his rights under the judgment at the same time extinguished ? It has been urged that the debt survived. It is true that Adams remained the bank\u2019s debtor for $700, but he was bound by a new contract in a new form, with which Banker had no concern. And with the hazard that he might be called upon for payment of the note removed, the vitality of his judgment was destroyed. His assignment could not galvanize it into fresh life, for on the 4th of February 187.5, he had no interest to assign. If the rights of Adams and Baur were alone involved, there would be no objection to their agreement that it should retain or regain its original efficacy. But nothing which they could do, even in conjunction with Banker, could affect the rights of intervening creditors, which became vested when, by the discharge of Banker, as endorser, the conditions ceased to exist, which gave to the judgment all the validity it possessed.'\nDown to the moment when Baur endorsed the new note, he had not been in any way connected with the debt. He was under no obligation to Ranker, to Adams or to the bank. While his \u00e9ndorsement worked the release of Banker, yet it created no duty towards himself, for as in Talmage v. Burlingame, 9 Barr 21, the act was without Banker\u2019s knowledge or request, and was done as a \u201c mere volunteer, and under no circumstances of compulsion, moral or legal.\u201d And' Adams was not competent to clothe Baur with Banker\u2019s rights, for that would have been the making a new consideration for and the writing of new conditions into the judgment. It was too late on the 9th of December to create a lien to have priority against other creditors from the 30th of October.\nIn no instance has the equitable doctrine of subrogation been carried to an extent that would support this decree. Ramsey\u2019s Appeal, 2 Watts 228; Dunn v. Olney, 2 Harris 219, and The Delaware and Hudson Canal Company\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright 512, which were relied on in the opinion of the president of the Common Pleas, were illustrations of Chief Justice Gibson\u2019s familiar rule, that \u201che who may at law control the application of two or more funds, shall not be suffered to use his legal advantages in a way to exclude the demands of a fellow creditor whose legal recourse is restricted to but one of them.\u201d Cottrell\u2019s Appeal, 11 Harris 294, was just the case this would be if the judgment against Adams had been held not by Banker, but by the Wyoming National Bank. An endorser paying Adams\u2019s note would become entitled to subrogation to the rights of the bank under the judgment as a cumulative security for a single debt. In Cottrell\u2019s Appeal, the endorser of th'e note of a defendant for the amount of a judgment paid it to the creditor, and took an assignment of the judgment. It was very justly ruled that he was entitled to payment in preference to a subsequent judgment entered before the pote was given. \u201c When an application is made for substitution,\u201d Judge Rogers said, in-Erb\u2019s Appeal 2 Penna. R. 296, \u201cthe court will take care that the subrogation of the surety shall work no injustice to the rights of others.\u201d While subrogation is founded on principles of equity and benevolence, and may be decreed where no\u2019 contract exists, yet it will not be decreed in favor of a mere volunteer, -who, without any duty, moral or otherwise, pays the debt of another: Hoover v. Epler, 2 P. F. Smith 522. It will not arise in favor of a stranger, but only in favor of a party who, on some sort of compulsion, discharges a demand against a common debtor: Mosier\u2019s Appeal, 6 P. F. Smith 76. Chief Justice Thompson-in that case said: \u201cI regard the doctrine as applicable in all cases where a payment has been made under a legitimate and fair effort to protect the ascertained interests of the party paying, and when intervening rights are not legally jeopardized or defeated.\u201d Taxes assessed against an owner of land were paid over during several years by the collector, without payment by the owner to him. Subsequently the owner confessed a judgment to the collector as a collateral security. In the distribution of the proceeds of the sale of the owner\u2019s estate it was held that the lien of the taxes was discharged by the payment over by the collector; that he was not to be regarded as a surety; that subrogation could not be allowed except in a clear case, and where it would work no injustice to others; and that the collector had no priority over liens which preceded his judgment: Wallace\u2019s Estate, 9 P. F. Smith 401. There was no privity of interest and no contract relation between Baur and Banker. Baur could create no duty to himself by a volunteered intervention for Banker\u2019s relief. Pie became Adams\u2019s endorser without being under any legal or moral compulsion, and he had no existing interest, ascertained or contingent, to protect. He has no equity to entitle him to subrogation. At the moment when the new note was taken by the bank, and the liability of Banker on the former one was discharged, the only reason for the efficient existence of the indemnifying judgment was swept away, and the judgments of the appellants took the place it had held in the order of priority of'liens.\nThe decree of the Court of Common Pleas is reversed at the costs of the appellee, and it is now ordered and adjudged that the residue of the fund in court, after the payment in full of the judgment of Robert Baur, No. 217, November Term 1874, be distributed, pro rata, to the judgments Nos. 240 and 359, November Term 1874, in favor of P. R. Webster and Goldsmith Brothers, the appellants."}
