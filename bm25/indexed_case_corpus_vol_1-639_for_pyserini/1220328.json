{"id": "1220328", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nAppellant contends that the orph\u00e1ns\u2019 court erred in construing the will to mean that the widow possessed but a determinable life estate: see Bruch\u2019s Estate, 185 Pa. 194, 39 A. 813.\nThe words of the will are: \u201cI give, devise and bequeath all my real, personal and mixed property . . . unto my . . . wife (appellant), as long as she remains my widow, and upon the death or re-marriage of my said widow the residue and remainder of my said estate shall be divided among my children, share and share alike. . . .\u201d It is earnestly urged by appellant that testator\u2019s use of the words \u201cresidue and remainder\u201d discloses a testamentary intent that the widow be given a life estate with power to consume. We find no justification for such implication. The words \u201cresidue and remainder\u201d are technical legal terms with a well understood and definite meaning. They signify all that is left after the gifts specified or designated have been paid or satisfied: Wood\u2019s Estate, 209 Pa. 16, 57 A. 1103; Carson\u2019s Estate, 130 Pa. Superior Ct. 133, 196 A. 527. Technical words, or words of a definite meaning, are to be construed according to their legal or definite effect. However, if it is apparent that testator has misused them, or has given them a meaning different from their fixed technical sense, effect must be given to the testator\u2019s intent, gathered from the writing as a whole: Carroll v. Burns, 108 Pa. 386; Graham v. Abbott, 208 Pa. 68, 57 A. 178; Lippincott\u2019s Estate, 276 Pa. 283, 120 A. 136; Smith\u2019s Petition, 291 Pa. 129, 139 A. 832. Counsel for appellant relies principally upon Byrne\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 513, 181 A. 500; Brennan\u2019s Estate, 324 Pa. 410, 188 A. 160, and Houser v. Houser, 268 Pa. 401, 112 A. 29. In each of them the life tenant was held to possess the power to consume. It will suffice to say that our examination of these cases reveals that the word \u201cremainder\u201d or \u201cbalance\u201d was employed in a sense that clearly altered and enlarged the technical or customary meaning of the word. No language which this testator used can be regarded as changing, even remotely, the technical meaning of the term \u201cresidue and remainder\u201d.\nDecree affirmed. Costs to be paid from the fund."}
