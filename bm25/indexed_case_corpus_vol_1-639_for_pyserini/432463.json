{"id": "432463", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, February 9th 1871, by\nWilliams, J.\n\u2014 This was an ejectment for 135 acres of. land in Cowanshannock township, in the county of Armstrong. It was shown by the evidence given on the trial that James Kinley died in the fall of 1849 intestate, seised of the land in controversy, leaving a widow, Sarah, now intermarried with Harrison Gourley, the defendants in the ejectment, and the plaintiff, his only son and heir at law, surviving; that James Hunter was appointed his guardian, on the 27th of March 1868, by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Armstrong county; and that the writ in this case was duly served on the defendants. This is the substance of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. The defendants, having given no evidence, requested the court to charge the jury: 1st. That under the evidence there cannot be, in any event, a recovery for more than the undivided two-thirds of the land. 2d. There being no evidence of an ouster in this case, the verdict must be for the defendants.\nThe court answered both points in the negative, and instructed the jury that the plaintiff, having shown a good title, must recover, and that the widoiv\u2019s remedy is in the Orphans\u2019 Court.\nThe assignments of error embrace the ansAver of the court to the defendants\u2019 points, and virtually raise but one question: Is the plaintiff, under the evidence, entitled to recover the land of which the intestate died seised ? In other words, can the heir at law turn the widow out of possession by ejectment before any proceedings have been had for the partition or appraisement of the estate ?\nThe Intestate Act of the 8th of April 1833 provides that \u201c where such intestate shall leave a widow and issue, the widow shall be entitled to one-third part of the real estate for the term of her life;\u201d and \u201c where such intestate shall leave a widow and collateral heirs or other kindred, but no issue, the widow-shall be entitled to one-half part of the real estate, including the mansion-house and buildings appurtenant thereto, for the term of her life.\u201d Under the provisions of the Orphans\u2019 Court Partition Act of the 29th March 1832, the widow\u2019s portion, whether there be one or more lineal descendants, or collateral heirs only, may be assigned to her by metes and bounds, if the estate can be divided without prejudice: Bishop\u2019s Appeal, 7 W. & S. 251; McCall\u2019s Appeal, 6 P. F. Smith 363. But where the estate cannot be divided among the lineal descendants and the widow, or among the collateral heirs and the widow, without prejudice to, or spoiling the whole, it may be appraised and finally sold, if no one, entitled to take it under the provisions of the act, will accept it at the appraisement. The widow cannot take the estate at the valuation put upon it by the inquest: Painter v. Henderson, 7 Barr 48. But if it is taken by one of the heirs, the act provides in substance that the sum at which her purpart is valued, or if the estate is sold, her share of the purchase-money shall be and remain charged upon the premises, and the interest thereof shall be annually and regularly paid to her, in lieu and full satisfaction of her dower at common \u00bfaw, to be recovered by distress or otherwise as rents are recoverable. What the precise nature of the widow\u2019s purpart or share is, when thus ascertained and charged on the land, is a questipn which has been much discussed, and in regard to which the authorities are somewhat discordant, owing to the different aspects in which the question has been presented. In Shaupe v. Shaupe, 12 S. & R. 9, and in Thomas v. Simpson, 3 Barr 60, it is declared to be \u201c an interest arising out of the land, in all respects of the nature of a rent-charge,\u201d and subject to levy and sale upon execution. In Miller v. Lindsay, 8 W. & S. 456, it is said that \u201c primarily and essentially her estate is a rent issuing out of the land, and therefore an incorporeal hereditament, ranking as real estate.\u201d In other cases, as in Medlar v. Aulenbach, 2 Penna. R. 355, and Hise v. Geigar, 7 W. & S. 273, it is treated as a statutory lien; in Bachman v. Chrisman, 11 Harris 163, it is called \u201cstatutory dower,\u201d and described as \u201ca defined interest in her late husband\u2019s land,\u201d and a \u201cfreehold estate.\u201d In Kurtz\u2019s Appeal, 2 Casey 465, it is said that \u201c whatever doubt there may be as to the nature of the widow\u2019s estate, it is certain that, so far as relates to the principal sum, it is simply a charge on the land in the nature of a lien, payable at the widow\u2019s death to the heirs of the intestate, to be recovered as personal only.\u201d\nThis case is criticised by Woodward,. J., in Zeigler\u2019s Appeal, 11 Casey 189, and his concurrence in the decree in that case, is put expressly on the ground that the widow\u2019s interest, as ascertained by proceedings in partition under the Act of 1794, is an estate in land, and not a lien within the meaning of the Act of. 1830, relative to the lien of mortgages; and it is reviewed in Schall\u2019s Appeal, 4 Wright 177, and the reasoning \u2014 but not the conclusion arrived at \u2014 is disapproved; and it is there said \u201c that the widow\u2019s statutory dower ought not to be treated as a lien on, land, but as an interest in it. What her estate really is, is expressed in the Intestate Act of 8th April 1838, \u00a7 1: \u2018 One-third part of the real estate for the term of her life,\u2019 and the form in which the law assigns it leaves its character unchanged.\u201d Again : \u201c It is an estate that is given by the intestate laws, and the partition laws do not change it.\u201d But whatever difficulty there may be in defining the estate, there is no difficulty in understanding what it really and practically is. Where the widow\u2019s share is laid off by metes and bounds, she has a life estate in the portion assigned to her as land, which carries with it as a necessary incident the right to receive the rents and profits; but where the estate is accepted at the appraisement or sold, she has a life estate, not in any specific portion of the land, but in an equivalent share of the rents and profits of the whole estate, measured by the interest on her share of its value as ascertained by appraisement or sale. In whichever form, therefore, the assignment of her share is made, she has an estate in the land of which her husband died seised, and by force of the statute it vests in her eo instanti the husband dies. Her interest in his lands is in no respect like dower at common law, except that it is only for life. No writ of dower lies for the share given her by the Intestate Act where the husband dies seised and in possession: Seider v. Seider, 5 Wh. 208. It is true that she may maintain an action of dower if the land is in the possession of one claiming it by title adverse to the heirs and denying her right, or of one not amenable to the Orphans\u2019 Court: Galbraith v. Green and Wife, 13 S. & R. 85; Evans v. Evans, 5 Casey 277. But where the husband dies seised and in possession of real estate, she must proceed under the partition acts to have her share assigned to her. Formerly the Orphans\u2019 Court alone had jurisdiction and authority to set out and d\u00e9termine the portion of the widow in her husband\u2019s estate: Seider v. Seider, supra; Thomas v. Simpson, 3 Barr 60; or to make partition between parties who take by descent from one who died sole seised: Clawges v. Clawges, 2 Miles; McMichael v. Skilton, 1 Harris 215. But now the exclusive jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court, in the partition and valuation of the real estate of intestat.eS, is taken away by the Act of the 21st of April 1846, Pamph. L. 426, and any of the parties interested in such estates may proceed by action of partition in the other courts of this Commonwealth having jurisdiction of the action of partition. But the concurrent jurisdiction conferred by this act is seldom or never exercised, owing to the practical inconvenience and difficulty of carrying out the provisions of the Orphans\u2019 Court Partition Act by an action of partition in courts of common-law jurisdiction.\nThe case of The Commonwealth v. Haffey, 6 Barr 348, where an action of partition was brought in the Common Pleas, and an action on the recognisance to secure the share of a married woman was brought in the District Court, is a practical illustration of some of the difficulties that must be met, and of the bungling expedients that must be adopted in order to overcome them. But though the act takes away the exclusive jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court, and gives the widow the right to choose the forum in which to seek her remedy, it does not change its essential character. Her remedy for the assignment of her share is still by partition or appraisement, as provided by the Partition Act, whether the proceeding is in the Orphans\u2019 Court or in the other courts to which concurrent jurisdiction is given. She cannot join with the heirs in bringing ejectment for the land belonging to her deceased husband ; nor can she bring ejectment for her interest in the real estate of which her husband died seised: Pringle v. Graw, 5 S. & B. 536; Bratton v. Mitchell, 7 Watts 113. But if she cannot bring ejectment for her interest in his estate, it does not follow that the heir can turn her out of possession, by an action of ejectment, before any proceedings have been had for the partition of the estate. If the widow\u2019s only remedy is by partition or appraisementj under the Act of 29th March 1832 and its supplements, why should it not be the only remedy of the heir ? She has a vested estate in the land of which her husband died seised, why then should she be turned out of its possession before her portion is assigned or secured to her, as provided by the act ? If the heir wishes the exclusive possession of his share, why should he not proceed to have it set off to him under the provisions of the partition laws ? But we are not without authority on this question. This is not the first attempt that has been made to turn the widow out of possession of the real estate of which her husband'died seised, without having her share assigned or secured to her. The experiment was tried in Seider v. Seider, 5 Wh. 208. There the action was brought by collateral heirs. The intestate died in 1831, seised of the real estate, leaving a widow and brothers and sisters, but no children. Upon the petition of the brothers and sisters, the Orphans\u2019 Court awarded an inquest. The inquest returned that the real estate could not be divided among the widow and legal representatives of the deceased in such manner as to give the widow the one-half, including the mansion-house, but made no appraisement. The finding of the inquest was confirmed by the Orphans\u2019 Court in 1833. The widow remained in possession after the death of her husband, and received the rents and benefits of the estate, until the trial of the ejectment in 1838, and it was held that the brothers and sisters could not maintain ejectment against her under the circumstances.\nThe judge, before whom the cause was tried, instructed the jury that \u201cthe widow is entitled to live in the mansion-house, and occupy the premises with the other heirs, until there is a proceeding to have the land appraised, when it will not divide, and her share is ascertained and secured, as the law provides\u201d; and in delivering the opinion of this court, Pluston, J., said : \u201c The question is, whether the brothers and sisters can by ejectment recover the whole or one-half of the estate, the widow never having resisted or denied their claim or right according to law. If they could so recover, what would be' done next? Would they bring a writ of partition at common law? The acts expressly forbid this. They must then petition the Orphans\u2019 Court, under and according to the Acts of Assembly. Rut they could have done this before bringing the ejectment; it was then useless; it was more, it was vexatious and oppressive, and against the express provision of the Act of 1774, which says, \u2018to prevent disputes, concerning the manner in which the partition of the intestate\u2019s estate may be made.\u2019 \u201d There is no substantial difference between that case and the one now before us. It is true that there the intestate left no issue, and that the widow was entitled to the one-half of the estate, including the mansion-house. But, except as to the quantity, her interest was the same as if there had been children, and she had got the one-third: Bratton v. Mitchell, supra. If the estate cannot be divided among the collateral heirs and the widow, it may be appraised and sold. The provision that the widow shall have the mansion-house, applies only to cases where actual partition can be made: McCall\u2019s Appeal, supra. And where there is a widow and one child, there may be partition between them, if it can be made without prejudice to the estate: Bishop\u2019s Appeal, supra. It is clear, then, that there is no difference in principle between the two eases. The decision in the one must govern the other. If the heir wishes to acquire the exclusive possession of the land, he must proceed under the Partition Acts to have the widow\u2019s share ascertained and secured to her, if the land cannot be divided between them. This is the remedy which the law provides, and the Act of the 21st of March 1806 makes it his duty to pursue it.\nIt follows that the court should have affirmed the defendant\u2019s 2d point, and instructed the jury that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.\nJudgment reversed."}
