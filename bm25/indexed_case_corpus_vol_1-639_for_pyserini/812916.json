{"id": "812916", "contents": "Opinion,\nMb. Justice Mitchell:\nThe jury have found for the plaintiff, and we must therefore assume that all the necessary facts were duly proved. This disposes of a considerable part of the argument for the appellee, and leaves open to us only the question of law involved in the point reserved, whether insanity is sickness or disability, within the meaning of the contract.\nThe operative words are contained in the following passages from the constitution and by-laws of the association: Constitution, article 9 : \u201c Every member.....who, through sickness or other disability, is unable to follow his usual business or some other occupation whereby he may earn a livelihood for himself and family, shall be entitled to such sums (as weekly benefits) as the by-laws shall specify; \u201d and by-laws, article 13, \u00a7 1: \u201c Any member, who, after twelve months\u2019 membership, through sickness or disability is unable to follow his usual or some other business or occupation whatsoever.....shall receive,\u201d etc. We cannot regard the meaning of this language as at all doubtful. That insanity is a sickness in some senses of the word is beyond question, and such legal authorities as appear to have considered the question hold that it is sickness within the meaning of such charters and articles of association as the defendant\u2019s. Thus in Burton v. Eyden, L. R. 8 Q. B. 295, an action against a \u201c friendly society,\u201d the English designation of associations like the present appellee, the words of the by-law were, \u201c during any sickness or accident that may befall him.\u201d Blackburn, J., said: \u201c I am of opinion that lunacy is sickness, within the meaning of the rules of this society.....Insanity depends on the state of mind and body of tile person......It certainly seems to me that lunacy is a sickness affecting the health of the body in such a way as to prevent a man\u2019s ability of earning his livelihood. If it were not the intention to include it, the rules of the society should be framed so as expressly to exclude it.\u201d And Quain, J., said further: \u201c I am also of opinion that insanity is sickness within the society\u2019s rules.....The words entitling the member to relief are, \u2018during any sickness or accident,\u2019 except certain excluded cases, insanity not being one.\u201d In Kelly v. Ancient Order, 9 Daly 292, Van Brunt, J., says: \u201cInsanity has always been considered a disease, and comes strictly within the meaning of the term sickness.\u201d And in Pellazzino v. St. Joseph\u2019s Society, 16 Cin. Law Bul. 27, it is assumed by Harmon, J., apparently without question by either party, that insanity entitles a member of such society to sick benefits.\nBut, even -if the extent of the word sickness were doubtful, the present case is relieved of all difficulty by the additional phrase \u201cother disability.\u201d The purpose of the association is defined by article II. of the constitution as the accumulation of a fund to enable the members \u201c to assist each other in cases of accident, sickness, or other distress, and their families in case of death.\u201d The common class of those who are expected to need the benefits, is defined in article IX., as already said, as those who, through sickness or other disability, are unable to follow their usual or some other business, whereby they may earn a livelihood for themselves and their families. To this class is added another in article X., to wit, the families of members who die, and members themselves whose wives die. The latter are clearly examples of that pecuniary distress which is enumerated in the constitution among the ills which it is the object to relieve. But the main idea, throughout, is the assistance of those who are incapacitated for earning their living, and the condition that the incapacity shall be from \u201c sickness or other disability \u201d is as comprehensive as language could well make it. If insanity is not sickness, it is certainly disability, and clearly within the prescribed condition for aid. Certain excepted cases are specified, but not only is insanity not one of them, but all of those which are thus specified, such as want of membership for twelve months, arrearages to the association, or sickness originating from intemperance, vicious or immoral conduct, either fail in some necessary requirement, or bear some taint of fault which takes them out of the category of the innocent unfortunate for whom the relief is intended. If any of these exceptional facts were charged against the plaintiff, the verdict of the jury has settled them in his favor, and there is no reason shown why he should not have the relief to which under the rules of the association his disability entitles him.\nJudgment reversed, and now judgment for plaintiff on the verdict."}
