{"id": "922863", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe testimony introduced by the litigants required the submission of the case to the jury. It follows that if there was no error in the charge or in the answers to the defendants\u2019 third, sixth and seventh points, the verdict rendered and the judgment entered thereon should be sustained. An examination of the charge, and of the answers to the points referred to, have not convinced us of error in either. We therefore dismiss the specifications and affirm the judgment."}
