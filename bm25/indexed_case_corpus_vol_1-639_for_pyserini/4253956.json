{"id": "4253956", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice STEVENS.\nThe Commonwealth appeals from the trial court\u2019s September 30, 2009 order granting Junius Burno a new trial based on his trial counsel\u2019s alleged ineffective representation in failing to object to remarks made by the prosecutor during her closing argument to the jury. Burno has filed a cross-appeal claiming the trial court erred in refusing to grant him relief on numerous remaining issues, which he raised in his post-sentence motions. We reverse the trial court\u2019s September 30, 2009 order granting Burno\u2019s motion for a new trial, remand for the resolution of any pending preserved claims related to trial court error raised in Burno\u2019s post-sentence motion, and dismiss Burno\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel without prejudice to his right to pursue those collateral claims under the PCRA.\nI. Background\nThe evidence at trial revealed the following facts: On April 13, 2003, Mary Meixell Moyer telephoned the police complaining she heard gunshots fired next door at 2628 South 4th Street in Allentown. Upon arriving at the scene, Allentown Police Officer Scott Derr discovered blood on the residence\u2019s front steps and on the back of a sign located on the porch. The front door of the residence was ajar, and the inside lights were on when Officer Derr entered the residence to perform a security check. Officer Derr discovered two homicide victims inside the residence and obvious signs that a struggle had taken place within the residence. One of the victims was found lying on his back in the doorway leading to the bedroom, while the other victim was found in the back of the bedroom curled up in a fetal position. Officer Derr secured the scene and waited for detectives from the Criminal Investigation Division to arrive.\nSubsequently, the first victim, who was found in the bedroom doorway, was identified as Carlos Juarbe, the lessee of the residence, and the second victim was identified as his friend, Oscar Rosado. Detectives processed the scene and spoke to witnesses. Specifically, when questioned, Ms. Moyer informed the police that, immediately after hearing gunshots, she saw two men flee the area in a red or maroon compact car with its headlights turned off. The detectives found a trail of blood leading from Juarbe\u2019s apartment to the spot where Ms. Moyer saw the car drive away from the area. The detectives recovered various blood samples, shell casings from a nine-millimeter luger, both jacketed and unjacketed lead projectiles, and a sawed-off 12-gauge double barreled shotgun containing one live shell and one spent shell of bird shot.\nThe blood evidence, which the detectives recovered from the scene, led the police to Terrance Bethea, who the police arrested on September 12, 2003, and charged him with murder. Bethea voluntarily gave a statement to Detectives Si-mock and Miller, admitting that he and Junius Burno were inside of Juarbe\u2019s residence when the two victims were shot and killed. Bethea also admitted that one of the victims shot him, and he and Burno fled from the scene in Burno\u2019s car.\nLater, on the same day, police interviewed Bethea\u2019s wife, who informed them that Burno and Bethea arrived together at her house during the early morning hours of April 13, 2003, and Bethea had a shotgun wound. Neither Burno nor Bethea would tell her how or why Bethea was shot. All three proceeded to a hospital in Philadelphia to seek medical treatment for Bethea, and while at the hospital, Bethea gave hospital personnel, and subsequently the police, a false name, false birth date, and false information about how he had been shot.\nThereafter, Detectives Simock and Miller contacted the Lansford Police Department, and based on information provided by that Department, the detectives determined that Burno owned a car, which matched Ms. Moyer\u2019s description of the vehicle that fled the scene of the double homicide. On the evening of September 12, 2003, Burno turned himself into the Allentown Police Department, and he was arrested. The next day, the Commonwealth filed a criminal complaint charging Burno with, inter alia, two counts of criminal homicide, and thereafter, the Commonwealth gave timely notice of its intention to seek the death penalty.\nSubsequently, Burno gave several conflicting statements to the police. For instance, he initially gave the police a statement claiming he and Bethea were innocent bystanders who were visiting Juarbe when two armed intruders entered the residence, and Bethea was shot when he got caught in the crossfire between Juarbe and the intruders. However, on September 24, 2003, Burno gave the police a taped statement in which he admitted to some involvement with the crime. Burno explained during the taped statement that, some months prior to the killings, Bethea had informed him that he obtained two handguns when he burglarized his neighbors\u2019 apartment. One of the handguns was a nine-millimeter model, which Bethea gave to Burno. He also explained that, in April of 2003, when he took his ex-wife, Michele Wright, medicine for their daughter, he stole a .38 caliber handgun from underneath Ms. Wright\u2019s bed. Burno claimed he drove Bethea to Juarbe\u2019s residence on the night in question in order to trade the .38 caliber handgun for drugs and money, and he remained in the car at all times. Burno further claimed in his taped statement that he heard two gunshots and then saw Bethea emerge from Juarbe\u2019s residence with a leg wound. Burno asserted he disposed of the stolen guns after he transported Bethea to the hospital in Philadelphia.\nOn September 26, 2003, Burno gave a third statement to the police in which he confessed that he and Bethea went to Juarbe\u2019s residence to rob him of drugs and money. In this third statement, Burno admitted he entered Juarbe\u2019s residence, he struggled with Rosado, and he shot Rosado in the bedroom with the nine-millimeter handgun. This version was consistent with the trial testimony of David Rawlins, a jailhouse informant who testified pursuant to a plea deal that Burno had provided him with a detailed account of the murders. According to Rawlins\u2019 testimony at Burno\u2019s trial, Burno claimed that he came to Bethea\u2019s aid after Bethea was shot in the leg and he shot Rosado after Rosado dropped to his knees, pleading for his life. Moreover, while jailed in the Lehigh County Prison, Burno made several telephone calls, which were recorded, admitting to his ex-wife and an acquaintance, James Alford, that he was involved in the shootings.\nDr. Samuel Land, a forensic pathologist who performed an autopsy on Rosado, testified that Rosado died of a gunshot wound to the head. The bullet entered his left ear and then severed the jugular vein and carotid artery as it proceeded downward into the body. Based on the trajectory of the bullet, Dr. Land opined that the gunman was above Rosado at the time of the shooting. Another forensic pathologist, Dr. Sara Lee Funke, performed an autopsy of Juarbe, and she observed eleven gunshot wounds, three of which were fatal chest wounds. Dr. Funke recovered from Juarbe a total of five bullets, which were of two different types. She testified the first type was a leaded, non jacketed projectile, which entered Juarbe from both contact and non-contact wounds, as indicated by the presence or absence of injury to the skin surrounding the point of entry. She concluded that the contact wounds and the positions and trajectories of their entries were consistent with a struggle between the victim and the assailant. She further testified that the second type of bullet recovered from Juarbe, the jacketed ammunition, did not enter through a contact wound. Finally, she noted that, in considering the trajectory of the bullets, with regard to at least one of Juarbe\u2019s wounds, the shooter was elevated higher than Juarbe.\nA ballistics expert, Pennsylvania State Police Sergeant Eric Wolfgang, analyzed the ammunition recovered from the scene and concluded two guns were utilized during the shootings inside of Juarbe\u2019s residence. He testified the jacketed bullets came from a nine-millimeter handgun and the non jacketed bullets were a .38 Special multi-ball type of ammunition, which was compatible with the gun Burno had stolen from his ex-wife.\nBurno took the stand in his own defense and recounted the sequence of events contained in his second police statement, ie., he claimed that he gave the stolen .38 caliber handgun to Bethea and remained in the car at all times. He claimed he did not know anyone had been killed inside of Juarbe\u2019s residence until the next day when he saw a news report about the shooting. Burno maintained he gave a statement falsely implicating himself in Rosado\u2019s murder because he was afraid of the death penalty, and his attorney warned him that Bethea would likely blame him for both murders. In rebuttal, the Commonwealth produced a fourth statement made by Burno that had been previously suppressed by the trial court on Sixth Amendment grounds. This fourth statement contradicted Burno\u2019s trial testimony and indicated that Burno had, in fact, shot both Juarbe and Rosado.\nAt trial, James Alford, the acquaintance to whom Burno had confessed in the recorded prison telephone call, denied any knowledge of Burno\u2019s involvement in the shootings. However, Alford admitted that, on April 13, 2003, the night of the murders, he received a telephone call from Burno asking if he could borrow Alford\u2019s vehicle, which was larger than Burno\u2019s vehicle, to take Bethea to the hospital. Alford described how they then exchanged vehicles. Alford acknowledged at trial that he subsequently gave a taped statement to police in which he indicated that, when the men exchanged vehicles on April 13, 2003, Burno admitted to his participation in the death of Juarbe and Rosado. However, at trial, Alford contended his statement to police was \u201cfabricated.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth additionally introduced at trial testimony from Bethea\u2019s neighbor, Paul DeMaria, who indicated he had a nine-millimeter handgun, a stereo, and phone stolen from his home only days after informing Bethea that he would be out of town for a few days. Another neighbor, who lived with DeMaria, testified she later observed the stereo and phone in Bethea\u2019s residence.\nOn March 5, 2007, the jury found Burno guilty on two counts of first-degree murder, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a). On March 6, 2007, the jury found one aggravating circumstance and the mitigation catchall, and determined that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating, thus sentencing Burno to death. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9711(d)(11) (an aggravating factor for death sentence purposes exists where \u201c[t]he defendant has been convicted of another murder committed in any jurisdiction and committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue.\u201d); (e)(8) (mitigating circumstances for death sentence purposes includes \u201c[a]ny other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.\u201d).\nOn March 12, 2007, Burno\u2019s trial attorneys, Mark S. Refowich, Esquire, and Victor E. Scomillio, Esquire, filed a motion to withdraw their representation, citing differences of opinion between Burno and counsel that rendered it impossible for counsel to zealously represent Burno post-sentence. Simultaneously, Burno\u2019s trial attorneys filed on behalf of Burno a post-sentence motion, which presented allegations related to alleged trial court error, insufficiency of the evidence, weight of the evidence, and excessiveness of sentence. Further, in the post-sentence motion, Burno\u2019s trial attorneys requested the trial transcript be produced, permission to supplement the post-sentence motions upon receipt of the transcript, and a hearing.\nBy order entered on August 7, 2007, the trial court granted Burno\u2019s trial attorneys\u2019 motion to withdraw their representation and appointed new counsel, Daniel Silverman, Esquire, to represent him. Thereafter, Attorney Silverman filed unopposed motions for leave of court to file an amended post-sentence motion, which the trial court expressly granted, and on May 20, 2008, he filed an amended post-sentence motion presenting a litany of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel during the guilt and penalty phases, as well as claims of alleged trial court error, insufficiency of the evidence supporting the guilty verdict, and weight of the evidence related to the guilty verdict.\nFrom February 10, 2009, to February 12, 2009, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing. By order and opinion entered on September 30, 2009, the trial court, upon consideration of Burno\u2019s post-sentence motion, granted Burno\u2019s request for a new trial and vacated his judgment of sentence. Specifically, in its opinion, the trial court, as a threshold matter, indicated that Burno had presented numerous claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. With regard to the trial court\u2019s ability to address the ineffectiveness claims in light of the then current procedural posture of the case and existing law, the trial court explained the following:\nBecause [Burno] has raised claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, as a threshold matter, it must be acknowledged that such claims are normally withheld until collateral review proceedings. See Commonwealth v. Grant [572 Pa. 48], 813 A.2d 726, 738 (Pa.2002). However, as recognized in Commonwealth v. Bomar [573 Pa. 426], 826 A.2d 831, 853-54 (Pa.2003), ineffective assistance claims are, in certain circumstances, cognizable within the chain of the direct challenge to the verdict. See also Com[monwealth] v. Chmiel [585 Pa. 547], 889 A.2d 501, [540] 613 (Pa.2005) (explaining [Bomar ] to hold that claims of counsel ineffectiveness reviewed in post-sentence proceedings were properly raised, preserved, and addressed in trial court). Here, with the matters fully briefed, argued, and addressed by successor defense counsel in post-sentence proceedings, the issue of effective assistance of counsel is ripe for determination of whether \u2018there is [arguable] merit to [Burno\u2019s] underlying claim,\u2019 whether trial counsel had a \u2018reasonable basis for his course of conduct,\u2019 and whether \u2018there is a reasonable probability that but for the act or omission in question, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.\u2019\nCommonwealth v. Burno, No. CP-39-CR0003637-2003, slip op. at 10 (C.P. Lehigh County, Sept. 30, 2009).\nAfter noting the three-prong test to be applied in determining whether trial counsel was ineffective as set forth in Strickland, and adopted by Pierce, the trial court turned to an examination of Burno\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s summation. Specifically, the trial court examined whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the following excerpts from the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, in which the prosecutor (1) made reference to Burno\u2019s other crimes and bad acts to refute Burno was a \u201cgood family man,\u201d and (2) argued, as a matter of fact, that Burno cowardly shot Juarbe while he was down on the ground:\nNow, Burno\u2019s statements. He is in jail, arrested, and he is afraid. He talks on these tapes about the chess game[,] about gambling. He is afraid Terrance [Bethea] is going to talk.\nSo what does he do? He jumps. He talks first, and on September 24th of 2003, he gives that statement, the same one he told you about here in the courtroom.\nIt\u2019s unreasonable, ladies and gentlemen, but he is sticking with it, because what else are you going to do once you confess? Recant, go back, take it back.\nHe wants you, while he is sitting up there on the stand, and throughout his statement, to believe the best of him, to believe that he is a good family man. It\u2019s a lie.\nWas he a good family man when his daughter was having her tonsils out, and he went to Michele Wright\u2019s apartment; ransacked it; read her journal, stole her journal?\nWas he a good family man when he and Terrance Bethea went into the DeMaria\u2019s apartment, and burglarized it and stole guns? Is he a good family man the night of these murders when he and Terrance went out doing coke, and drinking, and out all night with their guns, like tough guys?\nIs he a good family man that is willing to go down for a double homicide that he didn\u2019t commit? That\u2019s unreasonable. Unreasonable that you would be willing to do that for a man that you had just gotten back into contact with a few months before the murders. The same man, by the way, that you were willing to X out of your life over some parking tickets, Bethea.\nNow are you going to do all of this to help him out, and stand by him, and go down for a double murder that you didn\u2019t commit? Unreasonable.\nSo yes, we confronted Junius Burno about his lies. And then what happened? He confessed, and he said, I had the nine[-millimeter]. I finished off Carlos [Juarbe], and I shot Oscar [Rosado].\nHe still wants you to believe that he is a pretty nice guy, and that he really didn\u2019t mean it. But forensically, none of that adds up. [\u2018]It was dark in the room when I shot Oscar [Rosado]. I couldn\u2019t really see him.[\u2019] What did the first responder tell you? The lights were on.\n[\u2018]I was \u2014 I guess I went in the bedroom. I really didn\u2019t remember going into the bedroom, but I guess [I] did. And D [] jumped on him, and then he threw him off. And I shot him when he went to get up.[\u2019] Forensically, couldn\u2019t have happened. The coward shot him while he was down on the ground. I know that. Fact.\nI am standing before you now, and I am asking you, tell him there is no game. Tell him there is no chess; there is no gambling. It\u2019s over. The lies are done. Find him guilty of murder in the first degree for Carlos Juarbe, and guilty of murder in the first degree for Oscar Rosado.\nN.T., Trial, 3/5/07, at 764-765, 769-770, 776-777 (footnote added).\nWith regard to the Strickland/Pierce \u201carguable merit\u201d prong, the trial court recognized that a prosecutor must be given reasonable latitude in presenting her case to the jury, and prosecutorial misconduct will not be found where the prosecutor\u2019s comments are based on the evidence or proper inferences therefrom. See Commonwealth v. Thomas, 618 Pa. 70, 54 A.3d 332 (2012), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 173, 187 L.Ed.2d 119 (2013). Nevertheless, the trial court concluded the aforementioned excerpts from the prosecutor\u2019s summation constituted prosecutorial misconduct, i.e., prejudiced the jurors by forming in their minds a fixed bias and hostility toward Burno, thus impeding the jury\u2019s ability to weigh the evidence objectively and render a true verdict. See Commonwealth v. Bond, 539 Pa. 299, 652 A.2d 308 (1995). Specifically, as it relates to the prosecutor\u2019s references to Burno\u2019s prior crimes and bad acts to demonstrate Burno is not a \u201cgood family man,\u201d the trial court indicated, in relevant part, the following:\n[T]he admission of evidence of other crimes and bad acts is allowed for purposes expressly exclusive of either those relating to the character of [Burno] or an attempt to prove that he probably acted similarly in committing the crimes charged in the present case. Notwithstanding that limitation, however, the prosecution\u2019s closing argument highlighted the various misdeeds of [Burno] in order to impugn his character. In essence, the residual message left with the jury amounted to a contention that [Burno] was not a man of good character; therefore, he should not be believed. Moreover, in consideration of the manner in which the argument was presented, the jury may well have inferred that because [Burno] was not a good family man, but instead did drugs, drank alcohol, and committed crimes on other occasions, he was likely to have perpetrated these murders. Indeed, the panel was virtually invited to do so.\nAccordingly, by repeatedly interjecting into her closing argument the claim that [Burno] was not a \u2018good family man\u2019 on the basis of other \u2018bad acts,\u2019 the prosecutor overreached and introduced impermissible considerations into the jury\u2019s fair and impartial evaluation of the evidence in this matter. As a consequence, the jury was left to infer that because [Burno] had engaged in other wrongs at other times, he was a bad man and likely acted \u2018in conformity\u2019 with his previous misdeeds when he participated in the killings of Juarbe and Rosado.\nBurno, No. CP-39-CR0003637-2003, slip op. at 15-16, 19-20.\nThe trial court next noted it found \u201c[similarly troubling\u201d the fact the prosecutor personally vouched for the credibility of certain evidence in urging the jury to disregard Burno\u2019s explanation of events, particularly when the prosecutor stated that \u201c[t]he coward shot him while he was down on the ground. I know that. Fact.\u201d See Burno, No. CP-39-CR0003637-2003, slip op. at 20. The trial court opined that the prosecutor\u2019s statements went beyond proper \u201coratorical flair,\u201d and, instead, \u201cventured onto prohibited terrain as an improper expression of \u2018a personal belief as to [Burno\u2019s] guilt or innocence\u2019 and an unwarranted personal assessment of [Burno\u2019s] credibility.\u201d Burno, No. CP-39-CR0003637-2003, slip op. at 20. Thus, the trial court concluded Burno\u2019s claims, related to his allegation trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the challenged portions of the prosecutor\u2019s summation as set forth supra, possessed \u201carguable merit.\u201d\nTurning to the remaining prongs of the St\u00f1ckland/Pierce test, the trial court summarily held:\nOther than to recognize counsel\u2019s natural reluctance to object to closing argument out of a sense of professional courtesy, there is no rational basis to explain the failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s improper argument. In any event, even if an objection had been timely lodged, it is not at all apparent that a curative instruction could have salvaged the jury\u2019s ability to weigh the evidence objectively. Cf. Commonwealth v. Ragan [538 Pa. 2], 645 A.2d 811, 824 (Pa.1994) (mere argumentative and unwise comments that do not prejudice outcome do not warrant new trial especially where trial court immediately instructs jurors to disregard remarks). And with that taint hanging over the jury\u2019s ultimate determination, particularly in a case in which capital punishment is at stake, the verdict in this matter simply cannot be reconciled with the dictates of due process and notions of fundamental fairness upon which our system of justice is rooted. See Commonwealth v. Mitchell [576 Pa. 258], 839 A.2d 202, 214 (Pa.2003) (\u2018If there is a reasonable possibility that the error may have contributed to the verdict, it is not harmless.\u2019). A new trial must be had.\nAs a final note, it will be observed that overturning this conviction is troublesome. By his own repeated admissions, [Burno] was in one manner or another involved in the slaying of two persons. However, the determination of whether his role was limited to manning the getaway car in the aftermath of the killings or whether he was, in fact, in Juarbe\u2019s apartment and harbored the intent to kill the victims hinged in large measure on circumstantial evidence and which of [Burno\u2019]s various statements the jury decided to believe. The problem is that the prosecutor overreached. She introduced two additional factors for the jury to consider, both of which were improper and highly prejudicial. Her private assessment that [Burno] had lied and her derogation of his character as being less than a \u2018good family man\u2019 posed the very real possibility that the jury\u2019s deliberations were diverted from an impartial consideration of the evidence properly admitted.\nUnder our system of criminal justice, it has long been recognized that the prosecuting attorney \u2018is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty ... whose interest ... in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\u2019 Com[monwealth] v. Basemore [560 Pa. 258], 744 A.2d 717, 731 n. 12 (Pa.2000) (quoting Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88 [55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314] (1935)). The concept of justice, precisely because it is so important and fundamental, does not readily lend itself to pity definition. However, an abiding principle of our jurisprudence has been the recognition that when the procedure of adjudicating a defendant\u2019s rights becomes compromised, fairness is not possible, and without fairness there can be no justice. In short, to have confidence that justice has been done, the procedure utilized to achieve it must be fair. That was not the case here; therefore, [Burno\u2019s] conviction and sentence must be vacated so that a fair trial can be had.\nBurno, No. CP-39-CR0003637-2003, slip op. at 20-21, 24-25 (citations omitted).\nThus, concluding Burno met all three prongs of the ineffectiveness test as it relates to trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the challenged portions of the prosecutor\u2019s summation, the trial court vacated Burno\u2019s judgment of sentence and awarded him a new trial on this sole basis. The trial court noted that, since it was awarding Burno a new trial, it was unnecessary to reach Burno\u2019s remaining claims of error or ineffective assistance of counsel.\nThe Commonwealth filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court, and Burno filed a timely protective cross-appeal. On appeal, the Commonwealth challenges the trial court\u2019s grant of a new trial to Burno on the basis trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the challenged portions of the prosecutor\u2019s summation as set forth supra. Specifically, the Commonwealth presents the following two issues, which we set forth verbatim:\n1. Is the lower court\u2019s determination that trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument clearly erroneous because the underlying claim lacks arguable merit?\n2. Is the lower court\u2019s determination that trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument plainly erroneous because [Burno] was not prejudiced?\nCommonwealth\u2019s Brief, Statement of Questions Involved, at 3.\nIn his protective cross-appeal, Burno presents the following nine issues, which we set forth verbatim:\n1. Were [Burno\u2019s] statutory and constitutional rights to a speedy trial violated where trial commenced 663 days after the Commonwealth filed an improper interlocutory appeal (and 1, 249 days after arrest) where all of this delay was attributable to [the] Commonwealth[\u2019s] lack of diligence, and were all prior counsel ineffective for failing to adequately preserve this claim?\n2. Did the trial court err in admitting the second part of [Burno\u2019s] September 26, 2003 statement to the police as it was obtained by exploitation of the initial illegality in interrogating [Burno] minutes earlier in violation of his right to counsel, where the Commonwealth did not prove (nor could it) that the primary taint had been purged simply because counsel had now appeared, and was trial counsel ineffective for failing to preserve this claim?\n3. Did the trial court err in admitting [Burno\u2019s] September 26, 2003 statement as it was made in the course of negotiations between the parties and therefore inadmissible under Pa.R.Evid. 410, and were all prior counsel ineffective for failing to assert this independent basis for exclusion?\n4. Did not the Commonwealth fail to meet its burden to prove that [Burno] voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waived his fifth amendment right to remain silent, as [Bur-no\u2019s] pre-trial attorney rendered grossly ineffective assistance in advising [Burno] to provide a fully incriminating statement without having secured any benefit in exchange for [Burno\u2019s] cooperation, and was trial counsel ineffective for failing to adequately raise these grounds for suppression?\n5. Did the trial court err as a matter of law in refusing to suppress [Burno\u2019s] statements on the basis that [Burno\u2019s] arrest was unlawful as it was not supported by probable cause, the supporting affidavit to the arrest warrant was facially defective, and police withheld critical information from the magistrate who authorized the warrant, and were all prior counsel ineffective for failing to adequately litigate and preserve this claim?\n6. Did the trial court err in allowing the Commonwealth to introduce on rebuttal [Burno\u2019s] entire statement that the court had previously suppressed as having been obtained in violation of the right to counsel because only statements obtained in violation of Miranda may later be admitted to impeach a defendant\u2019s trial testimony and as to those statements only those portions which are impeaching are admissible, and were all prior counsel ineffective for failing to assert this ground for relief?\n7. Should not [Burno\u2019s] September 26, 2003 statement to police be suppressed in its entirety because the trial prosecutor applied undue pressure and coercion on [Burno] to confess when she met with [Burno] in the absence of counsel, while he was represented by counsel, and unlawfully induced him to confess, and were all prior counsel ineffective for failing to raise this claim?\n8. Did the trial court err when it made [Burno\u2019s] statements admissible where the court erroneously found in the absence of any record evidence that both the Commonwealth and [Burno] had reached an oral plea agreement pursuant to which [Burno] never entered a plea, nor was it ever entered upon record in open court, nor did [Burno] ever face a colloquy as required, nor was the plea ever accepted by the court as Pa.R.Crim.P. 590 criteria dictate, and did the trial court further err when it failed to find that the Commonwealth had breached the plea agreement as a result of its prior ruling that testimony by [Burno] against his co-defendant was not one of the terms of the plea agreement, assuming one existed?\n9. Is [Burno] entitled to the relief of suppression of his September 26, 2003 statement to police as the result of the cumulative impact of all the constitutional and statutory errors related to that statement set forth in this appeal?\nBurno\u2019s Brief, Statement of Questions Involved for Cross-Appeal, at 1-3.\nII. Discussion\nA. Sufficiency of the Evidence: First-Degree Murder\nInitially, although the issue has not been presented in either the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal or Burno\u2019s cross-appeal, we consider, as we must in all capital cases, whether the evidence is sufficient to support Burno\u2019s convictions of first-degree murder. See Commonwealth v. Sanchez, 623 Pa. 253, 82 A.3d 943 (2013) (indicating this Court conducts a sufficiency of the evidence review sua sponte in capital cases). In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we must determine \u201cwhether the evidence introduced at trial and all reasonable inferences derived from that evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of first-degree murder.\u201d Id. at 967 (citation omitted). Evidentiary sufficiency is a question of law, and thus, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Id.\nFirst-degree murder is an intentional killing, i.e., a \u201cwillful, deliberate and premeditated killing.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a), (d). \u201cTo obtain a first-degree murder conviction, the Commonwealth must demonstrate that a human being was unlawfully killed, the defendant perpetrated the killing, and that the defendant acted with malice and a specific intent to kill.\u201d Commonwealth v. Mattison, 623 Pa. 174, 82 A.3d 386, 392 (2013) (quotation, quotation marks, and citation omitted). It is well-settled that specific intent to kill may be established through circumstantial evidence such as the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim\u2019s body. Commonwealth v. Rega, 593 Pa. 659, 933 A.2d 997, 1009 (2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 1316, 128 S.Ct. 1879, 170 L.Ed.2d 755 (2008).\nAt trial, and as recounted supra, the Commonwealth presented evidence that, immediately after hearing gunshots fired from Juarbe\u2019s residence, Ms. Moyer saw two men flee from the area in a vehicle, which matched the description of a vehicle owned by Burno. Forensics determined the blood trail, which led from Juarbe\u2019s residence to the spot where the vehicle had been parked, matched that of Bethea, who later implicated Burno. Uncontested forensics evidence revealed that bullets fired from two guns, including the type of gun Burno had previously stolen from his ex-wife, were found at the scene and killed the victims. Dr. Land testified Rosado died from a gunshot wound to his head, and Dr. Funke testified Juarbe suffered eleven gunshot wounds, including three fatal chest wounds. The Commonwealth presented evidence that Burno turned himself into the police and confessed to participating in the murders. Additionally, the Commonwealth presented evidence of confessions Burno had made to his ex-wife and Alford while using a county prison telephone, as well as the confession he had made to a jailhouse informant. Although Burno testified he gave the gun, which he had stolen from his ex-wife to Bethea, and he remained in his vehicle during the killings, the jury was free to discount Burno\u2019s testimony and to credit the ample evidence presented by the Commonwealth establishing Burno\u2019s identity as a gunman. See Sanchez, supra. Accordingly, we hold that sufficient evidence was presented to permit the jury to properly conclude Burno fatally shot both victims in a vital part of their bodies with malice and with the specific intent to kill. Thus, having concluded the evidence was sufficient to sustain Bur-no\u2019s capital murder conviction, we proceed to discuss the issues presented in the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal and Burno\u2019s cross-appeal.\nB. Burno\u2019s Issues\nAt the outset, we recognize the procedural posture of this direct appeal is such that we must initially address the trial court\u2019s entertaining of Burno\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims on post-sentence motions. In its September 30, 2009 opinion, the trial court, noting that Burno had presented numerous claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in his post-sentence motions, recognized that such claims \u201care normally withheld until collateral review proceedings.\u201d Burno, No. CP-39-CR0003637-2003, slip op. at 10 (citing Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726 (2002)). However, further recognizing the ineffectiveness issues were \u201cfully briefed, argued, and addressed by successor defense counsel in post-sentence proceedings,\u201d the trial court concluded Bur-no\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims were \u201ccognizable -within the chain of the direct challenge to the verdict\u201d pursuant to the dictates of Commonwealth v. Bomar, 573 Pa. 426, 826 A.2d 831 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1115, 124 S.Ct. 1053, 157 L.Ed.2d 906 (2004). Burno, No. CP-39CR0003637-2003, slip op. at 10. As indicated supra, the trial court then proceeded to examine in detail in its opinion only two, of many, of Burno\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims, i.e., that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to two portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, and awarded him a new trial based thereon. In so doing, the trial court did not have the benefit of this Court\u2019s recent pronouncement in Commonwealth v. Holmes, 621 Pa. 595, 79 A.3d 562 (2013).\nRelevant to this appeal, in Holmes, this Court specifically reaffirmed Grant\u2019s general rule of deferral to PCRA review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Holmes, supra. In so doing, we specifically disapproved of expansions of the exception to Grant\u2019s general rule recognized in Bomar, and we limited Bomar, which was a case litigated in the trial court before Grant was decided and at a time when new counsel entering a case upon post-verdict motions was required to raise ineffective claims at the first opportunity, to its preGrant facts. Holmes, supra. However, we further specifically recognized two exceptions, both of which fall within the discretion of the trial judge. In this regard, we held the following: sentence, including an express recognition that the waiver subjects further collateral review to the time and serial petition restrictions of the PCRA. In other words, we adopt a paradigm whereby unitary review may be available in such cases only to the extent that it advances (and exhausts) PCRA review in time; unlike the so-called Bomar exception, unitary review would not be made available as an accelerated, extra round of collateral attack as of right. This exception follows from the suggestions of prior Court majorities respecting review of prolix claims, if accompanied by a waiver of PCRA review. See Commonwealth v. Wright [599 Pa. 270], 961 A.2d 119, 148 n. 22 (Pa.2008); Commonwealth v. Liston [602 Pa. 10], 977 A.2d 1089, 1095-1101 (Pa.2009) (Castille, C.J., concurring, joined by Saylor and Eakin, JJ.).\nFirst, we appreciate that there may be extraordinary circumstances where a discrete claim (or claims) of trial counsel ineffectiveness is apparent from the record and meritorious to the extent that immediate consideration best serves the interests of justice; and we hold that trial courts retain their discretion to entertain such claims.\nSecond, with respect to other cases and claims, including cases such as Bomar ..., where the defendant seeks to litigate multiple or prolix claims of counsel ineffectiveness, including non-record-based claims, on post-verdict motions and direct appeal, we repose discretion in the trial courts to entertain such claims, but only if (1) there is good cause shown, and (2) the unitary review so indulged is preceded by the defendant\u2019s knowing and express waiver of his entitlement to seek PCRA review from his conviction and\nHolmes, 621 Pa. at 598-99, 79 A.3d at 563-64 (internal citations omitted) (footnotes in original).\nAs we specifically indicated in Holmes, it is within the purview of the trial court\u2019s discretion to determine whether review at the post-verdict stage of the ineffectiveness claims is appropriate. See Holmes, supra. However, the trial court in this case proceeded solely under Bomar. That is, while the trial court addressed the merits of two of Burno\u2019s ineffectiveness claims, it did not do so on the basis of what Holmes now recognizes as valid exceptions to the rule of deferral to PCRA review as expressed in Grant. Holmes\u2019s express disapproval of extensions of Bomar, and its limiting of Bomar to that case\u2019s pre-Grant facts, requires Burno\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims be deferred to PCRA review.\nNotably, even if Holmes had not expressly limited Bomar, we conclude deferral is further appropriate in this case where, unlike in Bomar, the trial court did not pass upon Burno\u2019s numerous preserved direct appeal claims, but instead addressed only two, of many, of his collateral claims, granting relief on grounds that trial counsel was ineffective, leading both parties to appeal. Unlike Bomar, in this case, the sheer number of claims, both direct and collateral, raised by Burno in his post-sentence motions resulted in the trial court not passing upon all of his claims, concluding in an inefficient attempt to dispose of Burno\u2019s post-sentence motions. Thus, we conclude deferral of Burno\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims to the PCRA is the appropriate remedy. This will prevent the type of \u201cextra round of collateral attack for certain defendants, unauthorized by the General Assembly,\u201d which Holmes expressly rejected, and produce a more appropriate judicial treatment of Burno\u2019s ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims. Holmes, 621 Pa. at 619, 79 A.3d at 576.\nAs suggested supra, we conclude Burno\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims should be deferred to PCRA review, and, to the extent he presents such claims in his cross-appeal, we conclude the appropriate disposition of those collateral claims is dismissal without prejudice to Burno\u2019s right to pursue them under the PCRA. However, we further conclude that deferral without commentary upon the ineffectiveness claims giving rise to the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal would be fruitless and may cause confusion, and thus, we shall address the claims for the sake of clarity.\nC. The Commonwealth\u2019s Issues\nAs relevant here, counsel is presumed effective, and the burden of proving ineffectiveness rests on Burno. See Commonwealth v. Cooper, 596 Pa. 119, 941 A.2d 655 (2007). \u201c[T]he test for counsel ineffectiveness is[, in substance,] the same under both the Pennsylvania and federal Constitutions: it is the performance and prejudice test set forth in Strickland[, supra].\u201d Commonwealth v. Spotz, 582 Pa. 207, 220, 870 A.2d 822, 829 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 984, 126 S.Ct. 564, 163 L.Ed.2d 474 (2005) (quotation, quotation marks, and citations omitted). In Pennsylvania, we have divided the performance element into two sub-parts dealing with arguable merit and reasonable strategy. See Pierce, supra. Thus, to prove his trial counsel was ineffective, Burno must demonstrate that: (1) his underlying claim is of arguable merit; (2) counsel had no reasonable basis for his action or inaction; and (3) the petitioner suffered prejudice as a result. See Spotz, supra. Prejudice in this context requires a showing that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d Commonwealth v. King, 618 Pa. 405, 57 A.3d 607, 613 (2012) (quotation, quotation marks, and citation omitted). See Hinton v. Alabama, \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1081, 188 L.Ed.2d 1 (2014) (providing an example of the application of the reasonable-probability standard governing prejudice determinations). \u201cA reasonable probability is a probability that is sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the proceedings.\u201d Commonwealth v. Collins, 598 Pa. 397, 957 A.2d 237, 244 (2008) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052). See Hinton, supra. \u201cWhen a defendant challenges a conviction, the question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\u201d Hinton, - U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 1089 (quotation and quotation marks omitted). \u201cA failure to satisfy any prong of the test for ineffectiveness will require rejection of the claim.\u201d Spotz, 582 Pa. at 220, 870 A.2d at 830 (citations omitted).\nIn reviewing the claims of deficient stewardship, upon which the trial court granted Burno a new trial, we note the issues present mixed questions of law and fact. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 698, 104 S.Ct. at 2070 (\u201cBoth the performance and prejudice components of the ineffectiveness inquiry are mixed questions of law and fact.\u201d). This Court has adopted a de novo standard of review in determining whether counsel\u2019s performance fell beneath the constitutional floor, and we have stressed that we will accept the lower court\u2019s factual findings and credibility determinations, which are supported by the record. See Commonwealth v. Sattazahn, 597 Pa. 648, 952 A.2d 640 (2008), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1283, 129 S.Ct. 2765, 174 L.Ed.2d 273 (2009). With this legal framework in mind, we now examine the issues presented by the Commonwealth for our review.\nAlthough presented as two separate issues, the Commonwealth\u2019s issues are interrelated in that the issues focus on elements of Burno\u2019s claim trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument as set forth supra. Specifically, in its first issue, the Commonwealth questions whether the trial court erred in finding trial counsel to be ineffective since the underlying issue lacks \u201carguable merit.\u201d In its second issue, the Commonwealth questions the propriety of the trial court\u2019s analysis as it relates to the \u201cprejudice\u201d prong.\nWith regard to the \u201carguable merit\u201d prong, the Commonwealth acknowledges the trial court granted Burno relief based on two aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. Specifically, the trial court found \u201carguable merit\u201d to Burno\u2019s claims trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s (1) references to Burno\u2019s other crimes, bad acts, and wrongs to refute Burno was a \u201cgood family man,\u201d and (2) argument, as a matter of fact, that Burno cowardly shot Juarbe while he was down on the ground. Regarding the first aspect, the Commonwealth argues the trial court impermissibly viewed the prosecutor\u2019s statements in isolation and, when viewed in proper context, the prosecutor\u2019s statements were not improper. The crux of the Commonwealth\u2019s position is that all of the statements at issue constituted permissible oratorical flair and the prosecutor \u201cwas fairly commenting\u201d on evidence of other crimes, which Burno candidly acknowledged occurred in his trial testimony. The Commonwealth submits the trial court assessed these comments out of context, in that the prosecutor was properly referencing admissible evidence, and legitimate inferences arising therefrom, which disputed the reasonableness of the version of events Burno presented to the jury.\nAs it relates to the second aspect, the Commonwealth argues the trial court erred in finding the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of evidence and the comment went beyond oratorical flair. To the contrary, the Commonwealth argues that, when the prosecutor\u2019s comment is viewed in proper context, it is clear the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cstatement was merely a passing comment within a large argument.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 21. Further, the Commonwealth argues the trial court ignored the fact the prosecutor\u2019s comment was a direct response to the defense\u2019s closing argument, as well as based on the evidence and legitimate inferences derived therefrom.\nIn response, regarding the first aspect, Burno contends the trial court properly concluded the prosecutor\u2019s summation improperly highlighted Burno\u2019s \u201cvarious misdeeds\u201d in order to impugn his character. That is, Burno argues the prosecutor\u2019s statements regarding Burno\u2019s prior crimes and misdeeds encouraged the jury to convict Burno on the theory that \u201che was a bad person, with a criminal record, who mistreated the mother of his daughter and liked to do drugs and drink alcohol.\u201d Burno\u2019s Brief at 21. Burno argues the prosecutor impermissibly \u201csought to persuade the jury to dislike [Burno] as a \u2018bad family man,\u2019 because of certain prior bad acts or other crimes-the very propensity argument the law forbids under any circumstance.\u201d Burno\u2019s Brief at 21 (citations omitted). Further, Burno submits the defense neither \u201copened the door\u201d to the prosecutor\u2019s cascade of personal attacks nor portrayed Burno as a \u201cgood family man,\u201d and thus, the prosecutor\u2019s statements were not a \u201cfair response\u201d to the defense\u2019s argument.\nAs it relates to the second aspect, Burno contends the prosecutor\u2019s statement she knew as fact that Burno shot Juarbe while he was lying on the ground was a \u201cgrossly improper statement expressing her personal belief in the guilt of [Burno] and the credibility of her evidence.\u201d Burno\u2019s Brief at 19. He also suggests the prosecutor\u2019s statement was not supported by the evidence.\nThe legal principles relevant to a claim of prosecutorial misconduct, and the derivative ineffective assistance claim grounded in counsel\u2019s failure to object to a prosecutor\u2019s comments during summation, are well-established. To succeed on such a claim, Burno was required to demonstrate that the prosecutor\u2019s comments violated a constitutionally or statutorily protected right, such as the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination or the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial, or a constitutional interest such as due process. See Commonwealth v. Elliott, 622 Pa. 236, 80 A.3d 415 (2013). \u201cTo constitute a due process violation, the prosecutorial misconduct must be of sufficient significance to result in the denial of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. The touchstone is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d Commonwealth v. Spotz, 616 Pa. 164, 47 A.3d 63, 97 (2012) (citations omitted).\n\u201cA prosecutor may make fair comment on the admitted evidence and may provide fair rebuttal to defense arguments. Even an otherwise improper comment may be appropriate if it is in fair response to defense counsel\u2019s remarks. Any challenge to a prosecutor\u2019s comment must be evaluated in the context in which the comment was made.\u201d Elliott, 622 Pa. at 282, 80 A.3d at 443 (quotation omitted).\nNot every unwise, intemperate, or improper remark made by a prosecutor mandates the grant of a new trial[.] Reversible error occurs only when the unavoidable effect of the challenged comments would prejudice the jurors and form in their minds a fixed bias and hostility toward the defendant such that the jurors could not weigh the evidence and render a true verdict.\nSpotz, 616 Pa. at 222, 47 A.3d at 98 (citations omitted).\nWhile it is improper for a prosecutor to offer any personal opinion as to the guilt of the defendant or the credibility of the witnesses, it is entirely proper for the prosecutor to summarize the evidence presented, to offer reasonable deductions and inferences from the evidence, and to argue that the evidence establishes the defendant\u2019s guilt---- [The] prosecutor must be free to present his or her arguments with logical force and vigor, and comments representing mere oratorical flair are not objectionable.\nThomas, 618 Pa. at 79-80, 54 A.3d at 338 (citations, quotation, and quotation marks omitted).\nApplying these legal standards to the first aspect of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, in which the prosecutor referenced several of Burno\u2019s other crimes, bad acts, and wrongs to refute Burno was a \u201cgood family man,\u201d we agree with the Commonwealth that the trial court erred in finding Burno\u2019s underlying claim met the Strickland/Pierce \u201carguable merit\u201d prong. When properly viewed in context, we conclude the prosecutor did not argue that Burno should be convicted of the instant crimes because he was not a \u201cgood family man\u201d or that the jury should infer that he probably committed the crimes at issue because of his prior misdeeds. Rather, the prosecutor argued that Burno\u2019s version of events, wherein he depicted himself as an innocent bystander who was just trying to assist a friend in trouble, was not worthy of belief in light of the conflicting statements Burno made to the police and others in which Burno implicated himself as the killer of both victims.\nIt was proper for the prosecutor to respond vigorously to the defense\u2019s argument and theories by emphasizing the implausibility of Burno\u2019s trial testimony. See Thomas, supra. This is particularly true given the fact evidence of the other crimes, bad acts, and wrongs to which the prosecutor referred in the challenged portion of her summation was introduced at trial. See id. As indicated supra, the prosecutor was permitted to summarize this evidence, offer reasonable deductions and inferences from the evidence, and utilize \u201coratorical flair,\u201d such as the phrase \u201cgood family man,\u201d in making her closing argument to the jury. By doing so, the prosecutor did not \u201cprejudice the jurors and form in their minds a fixed bias and hostility toward [Burno] such that the jury could not weigh the evidence and render a true verdict.\u201d Spotz, 616 Pa. at 222, 47 A.3d at 98. Thus, as we find there to be no objectionable prosecutorial misconduct in this regard, we conclude the trial court erred in finding Burno\u2019s underlying claim met the Strickland/Pierce \u201carguable merit\u201d prong, and thus, trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective on this basis.\nWe now turn to the second aspect of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, in which the prosecutor stated, \u201cThe coward shot him while he was down on the ground. I know that. Fact.\u201d N.T., Trial, 3/5/07, at 770. Applying the legal standards as set forth supra, we agree with the Commonwealth that the trial court erred in finding Burno\u2019s underlying claim satisfied the Strickland/Pierce \u201carguable merit\u201d prong. When viewed in context, we conclude the prosecutor\u2019s statement, suggesting Burno shot Juarbe while he was lying on the ground, was a permissible appeal to the jury to make a logical inference from the evidence adduced at trial in support of the Commonwealth\u2019s theory, which was naturally opposed to the defense\u2019s theory. The statement was a fair comment based on the evidence presented at trial, including testimony from Officer Derr, the first responder who indicated he found one of the victims lying on his back in the bedroom doorway, as well as forensic testimony from Dr. Funke, who performed the autopsy on Juarbe. The fact the prosecutor\u2019s statement contradicted Burno\u2019s version of events does not amount to an improper bolstering of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence or an improper expression of the prosecutor\u2019s personal belief as to Burno\u2019s guilt. The prosecutor here did not imply that she had special knowledge or an innate ability to determine guilt based upon her position as a prosecutor. Rather, with permissible \u201coratorical flair,\u201d the prosecutor implored the jury to render a verdict favorable to the Commonwealth. See Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, 553 Pa. 485, 720 A.2d 79 (1998), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 810, 120 S.Ct. 41, 145 L.Ed.2d 38 (1999) (holding no new trial was warranted based on allegations of prosecutorial misconduct in closing arguments, where prosecutor\u2019s statements involved fair response to defense evidence; prosecutor did not personally vouch for credibility of witness but rather properly argued witness\u2019 testimony supported guilty verdict). We emphasize that the \u201cprosecutor has reasonable latitude during h[er] closing argument to advocate h[er] case, respond to arguments of opposing counsel, and fairly present the Commonwealth\u2019s version of the evidence to the jury.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hanible, 612 Pa. 183, 30 A.3d 426, 465 (2011), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 835, 184 L.Ed.2d 662 (2013) (quotation and quotation marks omitted). Thus, as we deem there to be no objectionable prosecutorial misconduct in this regard, we conclude the trial court erred in finding Burno\u2019s underlying claim met the Strickland/Pierce \u201carguable merit\u201d prong, and therefore, trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective on this basis.\nAs indicated supra, in its second issue, the Commonwealth challenges the propriety of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Burno met his burden of proving the Strickland/Pierce prejudice prong as it relates to trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. Specifically, the crux of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument is the trial court\u2019s prejudice analysis was \u201cperfunctory,\u201d resulting in the trial court failing to recognize its repeated instructions on the limited role of counsel\u2019s argument to the jury mitigated any chance of prejudice and the overwhelming evidence of guilt reveals the outcome of Burno\u2019s trial would not have been more favorable to him had his counsel objected to the challenged portions of the prosecutor\u2019s summation.\nBurno, in contrast, submits the trial court properly concluded the prosecutor\u2019s remarks so tainted the jury with prejudice and bias toward him that their ability to weigh the evidence objectively was impeded. He submits \u201cthe trial court carefully examined the remarks in the context of the overall evidence presented at trial and the competing trial theories of [the] prosecution and [him].\u201d Burno\u2019s Brief at 25. Having presided over the trial, Burno contends the trial court was \u201ckeenly aware\u201d of the prosecutor\u2019s statements prejudicial effect, and thus, the trial court properly found \u201cno harmless error.\u201d See Burno\u2019s Brief at 25, 27.\nSince Burno failed to meet his burden of proving the Strickland/Pierce \u201carguable merit\u201d prong with regard to his underlying claims of error, his ineffectiveness claim fails on this basis alone. Commonwealth v. Hutchinson, 611 Pa. 280, 25 A.3d 277 (2011), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2711, 183 L.Ed.2d 70 (2012) (where the appellant\u2019s assertions of prosecutorial misconduct during summation had no merit, trial counsel could not be deemed ineffective); Commonwealth v. Wright, 599 Pa. 270, 961 A.2d 119, 149 (2008) (\u201cFailure to meet any prong of the test will defeat an ineffectiveness claim.\u201d) (citation omitted). However, we would be remiss if we did not comment on the fact the trial court did not utilize entirely the correct standard in concluding Burno was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s summation, particularly since it is likely Burno will raise ineffectiveness claims under the auspices of the PCRA. Here, the trial court applied, to some extent, the \u201charmless error\u201d standard in determining whether Burno was prejudiced; however, as this Court has suggested, \u201cthe test for prejudice in the ineffectiveness context is more exacting than the test for harmless error, and the burden of proof is on the defendant, not the Commonwealth.\u201d Commonwealth v. Spotz, 582 Pa. at 227, 870 A.2d at 834 (citations omitted). As a general and practical matter, it is more difficult for a defendant to prevail on a claim litigated through the lens of counsel ineffectiveness, rather than as a preserved claim of trial court error. As indicated supra, in order to demonstrate a defendant was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance, the defendant must \u201cshow that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different.\u201d Hinton, \u2014 U.S. at -, 134 S.Ct. at 1089 (quotation and quotation marks omitted). In light of the distinct review standards applicable to a preserved claim of trial court error versus a claim sounding in ineffective assistance of counsel, we conclude the trial court erred in utilizing the \u201charmless error\u201d standard, rather than the Strickland/Pierce \u201cprejudice\u201d standard, in analyzing Burno\u2019s ineffectiveness claims.\nViewing the prejudice question under the appropriate standard, we agree with the Commonwealth that, assuming, arguendo, Burno\u2019s underlying claims did not lack \u201carguable merit,\u201d he would not otherwise be entitled to relief since Burno did not meet his burden of proving prejudice, ie., that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s failure to object to the challenged portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt. See Hinton, supra; Commonwealth v. Montalvo, 604 Pa. 386, 986 A.2d 84 (2009), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 127, 178 L.Ed.2d 77 (2010) (assuming, arguendo, prosecutor\u2019s comments during penalty phase were improper, the appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim fails since he failed to demonstrate prejudice pursuant to Strickland/Pierce). In this regard, we note the trial court fully instructed the jury it was not to consider the attorneys\u2019 arguments as evidence or consider any opinion, which the attorneys may express concerning Burno\u2019s guilt or innocence. N.T., Trial, 2/26/07, at 20-21, 29; N.T., Trial, 3/5/07, at 723, 783, 809. The jury is presumed to have followed the trial court\u2019s instructions. See Elliott, supra (recognizing juries are presumed to follow trial court\u2019s instructions).\nMoreover, the evidence of Burno\u2019s guilt was overwhelming. See Commonwealth v. Busanet, 618 Pa. 1, 54 A.3d 35 (2012), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 178, 187 L.Ed.2d 122 (2013) (discussing overwhelming evidence of guilt as it relates to finding of prejudice under the Strickland/Pierce standard). For instance, as more fully detailed supra, the Commonwealth presented evidence of an eyewitness, Ms. Moyer, who heard gunshots and immediately saw two men flee the area in a vehicle, which matched the description of a vehicle owned by Burno. Forensics determined the blood trail, which led from the residence where the murders occurred to the area where Ms. Moyer saw the subject vehicle parked, matched that of Bethea, who later implicated Burno. The Commonwealth presented evidence that Burno subsequently turned himself into the police and confessed to participating in the murders. The Commonwealth further presented evidence of Burno\u2019s confessions, which he made to his ex-wife and Alford while using a county prison telephone, as well as the confession, which Burno made to a jailhouse informant. Moreover, forensics linked bullets from the crime scene to a gun, which was compatible with the gun Burno stole from his ex-wife. Thus, we conclude Burno\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness additionally fails since he failed to demonstrate prejudice under Strickland/Pierce. See Commonwealth v. Cox, 603 Pa. 223, 983 A.2d 666 (2009) (where the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, including eyewitness testimony and the appellant\u2019s confessions to police, overwhelmingly established guilt, the appellant failed to show he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to request cautionary instructions for statements made by the prosecutor in his opening and closing statements indicating the appellant was involved in a drug trafficking organization). We caution the lower court that, in the likely event Burno presents the court with ineffective assistance of counsel claims under the auspices of the PCRA, the court should look to this Court\u2019s opinion for guidance, particularly as it relates to an assessment of the Strickland/Pierce prejudice prong.\nIII. Conclusion\nWe reverse the trial court\u2019s September 30, 2009 order granting Burno\u2019s motion for a new trial, remand for the resolution of any pending preserved claims related to trial court error raised in Burno\u2019s post-sentence motion, and dismiss Burno\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel without prejudice to his right to pursue those collateral claims under the PCRA. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices EAKIN and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\nJustice BAER files a concurring opinion in which Justice TODD joins.\n. Following the filing of this Court\u2019s November 4, 2013 per curiam order, in which we sua sponte directed the matter be resubmitted for consideration on previously filed briefs, this case was reassigned to this author. The case had been held internally pending this Court's filing in Commonwealth v. Holmes, 621 Pa. 595, 79 A.3d 562 (2013).\n. Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-46 (\"PCRA\u201d).\n. The aggravating factor arose from the jury convicting Burno of first-degree murder with regard to both Rosado and Juarbe prior to the penalty phase.\n. As the trial court noted, in his post-sentence motion, Burno presented no less than forty-five claims for the trial court's consideration. Commonwealth v. Burno, No. CP-39-CR0003637-2003, slip op. at 9 (C.P. Lehigh County, Sept. 30, 2009).\n. To establish trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, the defendant must demonstrate: (1) the underlying claim has arguable merit; (2) counsel had no reasonable basis for the course of action or inaction chosen; and (3) counsel\u2019s action or inaction prejudiced the petitioner. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987).\n. The record reveals \"D\" was Carlos Juarbe's street name.\n. However, the trial court suggested it generally found meritless Bur-no's challenges to the introduction of \u2018\u2018other crimes and bad acts evidence\u201d relating to him drinking beer, smoking marijuana, snorting cocaine, and driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol on the day in question, as well as evidence suggesting he conspired with Bethea to store stolen goods, lied to the police, lied to the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, stole his ex-wife's keys, was told by his ex-wife not to \"get into any more trouble,\u201d and uttered profanities at the police. Burno, No. CP-39-CR0003637-2003, slip op. at 9-10. The trial court concluded \"all of the \u2018other\u2019 bad acts cited by [Burno] were relevant to establish opportunity, plan, identity, or intent, or, alternatively were appropriately admitted for the limited purpose of presenting the jury with the complete story of the chain of events resulting in [Burno] murdering Juarbe and Rosado and then attempting to cover up his crimes.\u201d Burno, No. CP-39-CR0003637-2003, slip op. at 11. Moreover, the trial court noted that, as it relates to Bumo's challenges to the trial court\u2019s failure to suppress Burno\u2019s out-of-court police statements, as well as challenges Burno raised in pre-trial motions, no relief was due and it was relying on its previously filed opinions on the issues. Further, as it relates to Burno\u2019s contention it was improper for the Commonwealth to require him to wear a \"stun belt\u201d during trial, the trial court indicated no relief was due since \"the restraint was not visible to the jury and there was no evidence that the \u2018belt psychologically hindered him from fully participating in his trial[.]\u2019 \u201d Burno, No. CP-39-CR0003637-2003, slip op. at 22.\n. The trial court directed the Commonwealth to file a statement of matters complained of on appeal pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 1925(b), and the Commonwealth timely and adequately complied. The trial court did not direct Burno to file a Rule 1925(b) statement.\n[I]n short sentence cases the trial court's assessment of good cause should pay particular attention to the length of the sentence imposed and the effect of the length of the sentence will have on the defendant\u2019s realistic prospect to be able to avail himself of collateral review under the PCRA.\nUnitary review describes the defendant\u2019s ability to pursue both preserved direct review claims and collateral claims of trial counsel ineffectiveness on post-sentence motions and direct appeal, and could aptly describe both exceptions we recognize today. However, for purposes of [Holmes], we intend the term only to describe the second exception, i.e., that hybrid review which would encompass full-blown litigation of collateral claims (including non-record-based claims).\n. Significantly, for purposes of fashioning the appropriate mandate in this case, we note each of the issues presented in Burno\u2019s cross-appeal, with the exception of numbers eight and nine, which Burno faults the trial court for failing to address, explicitly sound in the ineffective assistance of counsel. While issue number eight alleges trial court error, our preliminary review reveals that this issue appears to be derivative of issue number three, was thus waived by trial counsel\u2019s failure to argue it below, and accordingly, would likewise be cognizable solely as a claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness. Issue number nine presents a cumulative error argument, which has no application at this time in light of the unreviewable nature of the individual claims upon which it is premised. In any event, to the extent issues eight and nine are allegations of preserved trial court error, which were presented in Burno\u2019s post-sentence motion, the trial court may fully consider the issues upon remand.\n. The trial court recognized as much in its opinion when it found all of the \"other bad acts\u201d cited by Burno were properly admitted into evidence. Burno, No. CP-39-CR0003637-2003, slip op. at 11.\n. Regarding trial counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s summation, the Commonwealth and Burno have interwoven into their appellate arguments averments more specifically related to the Strickland/Pierce \"reasonable basis\u201d prong. However, in light of our foregoing analysis, it is unnecessary for us to address specifically the \"reasonable basis\u201d prong.\n. As indicated supra, having awarded Burno a new trial based on his claim trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to the challenged portions of the prosecutor\u2019s summation, the trial court specifically indicated it need not reach Burno's remaining claims, which included allegations of trial court error. Thus, since we have reversed the trial court's grant of a new trial, we remand for the trial court to dispose of the remaining preserved claims of alleged trial court error, which Burno presented in his post-sentence motions."}
