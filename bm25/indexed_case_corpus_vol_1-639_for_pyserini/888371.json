{"id": "888371", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe find no error in this record that would justify us in sustaining either of the assignments of error. The questions presented have been so fully considered and so satisfactorily disposed of by the learned auditing judge, in his supplemental adjudication, that nothing can be profitably added to what he there said. For reasons given in his opinion and concurred in by the orphans\u2019 court in banc the decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellants."}
