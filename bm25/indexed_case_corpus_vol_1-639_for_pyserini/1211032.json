{"id": "1211032", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the refusal of the court below to take off a compulsory non-suit in an action of trespass. The statement of claim averred that the defendant, the owner of certain premises, orally agreed when these premises were leased to plaintiff, Albert Klais, on October 8,1938, \u201cto make all necessary repairs to said premises and particularly agreed to repair the cellar steps leading from the kitchen to the' cellar\u201d and \u201cdid make most of the repairs, . . . including the cellar steps\u201d, but \u201cfailed to make proper repairs to the cellar steps\u201d and \u201cfailed to make them secure and safe\u201d. Another averment is that the repair work \u201cwas done so negligently and improperly that the said steps remained in a defective and dangerous condition\u201d.\nOn or about May 15, 1940, plaintiff, Isabelle Klais, while descending these steps fell and was injured because, as alleged, \u201cthe second tread\u201d of the cellar steps \u201csuddenly gave way and collapsed\u201d.\nAt the trial plaintiff\u2019s proof went to the averment that the repairs to the cellar steps was negligently performed. It is the law that a landlord who undertakes to repair premises leased and does so negligently and thereby causes injury to a person lawfully using them is liable to the injured party. See Harris v. Lewistown Trust Co., 326 Pa. 145, 191 A. 34.\nThe court below held that \u201cthe proof for plaintiffs fell completely.\u201d The testimony supports this conclusion. Mrs. Klais testified that after the cellar steps were repaired they \u201cwere all right\u201d but in a few months \u201cthey started to get wobbly again\u201d. She reported to the land' lord this condition and then \u201ca colored man came up and looked at them and told (her) he fixed them and they were all right to use\u201d. She had heard him \u201chammering\u201d and \u201cworking on the steps\u201d. After he had reported the steps as being \u201call right\u201d she looked at the steps and found \u201cthey were all right\u201d. She added: \u201cThen on the 15th of May when I went down the cellar this second step from the top gave way before me and I fell to the cellar floor.\u201d It is clear that all plaintiffs proved in support of their charge of negligence is the happening of an accident to Mrs. Klais. This was insufficient. The doctrine of res ipsa loquitur does not apply in a case of this kind. Just what caused the steps to give way does not appear. As the trial judge pointed out: \u201cThere was no proof in the testimony of a latent defect.\u201d What caused the steps to give way can only be conjectured, and as we said in Whigham v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 343 Pa. 149, 22 A. 2d. 704: \u201cThe burden of proof resting upon plaintiffs in civil actions cannot be met by conjectures. The phrase \u2018burden of proof\u2019 means exactly what it says.\u201d\nComplaint is also made because the trial judge rejected the testimony of an architect. On this phase of the case the following appears in the record: Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel: \u201cI have one witness who will testify, an architect, as to the quality of the wood.\u201d The Court: \u201cHave you alleged the quality of the wood was bad, in your statement?\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel: \u201cNo.\u201d The Court: \u201cThen I cannot hear any testimony about it.\u201d The Court was manifestly correct in so ruling. If the quality of the wood used in the repairs was to be an issue, plaintiffs in their statement should have apprised the defendant of that fact. The general language used in the statement gave no intention of any such issue.\nOn the question of Mrs. Klais\u2019 contributory negligence the Court pertinently pointed out: \u201cIf we take the allegations of the statement that the defective condition had continued from October 8, 1939, to May 15, 1940, then plaintiff daily took the risks of the condition of the steps which she knew all about.\u201d\nIn plaintiffs\u2019 statement of question involved appears the following: \u201cShould the Court on the trial of a case before a jury, after the material part of the evidence, but not all has been presented, without motion of any kind from defendant or defendant\u2019s counsel, enter a judgment of non-suit?\u201d That the trial judge did so is assigned for error. The record shows that the action so taken by the court was after the evidence as to liability was all in and plaintiffs\u2019 counsel announced: \u201cI am going on with the injuries.\u201d The Court then said: \u201cI want to save the public time. Tell me what you base liability on.\u201d A discussion then followed as to whether or not non-suit should be entered. It was so entered.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 counsel bases his contention that the trial judge cannot enter a compulsory non-suit without defendant\u2019s moving for one, on Buie 224 of Pennsylvania Buies of Civil Practice, which reads as follows: \u201cThe court may compel the plaintiff in any action to produce all his evidence upon the question of the defendant\u2019s liability before he calls any witness to testify solely to the extent of the injury or damages. The defendant\u2019s attorney may then move for a non-suit. If the motion is refused, the trial shall proceed. The court may, however, allow witnesses to be called out of order if the court deems it wise so to do.\u201d\nThis rule does not mean that defendant\u2019s attorney must move for a non-suit before the court can enter it. The rule prescribes that after all of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence on the question of liability is produced, defendant\u2019s attorney may, if he chooses, move at that stage of the case for a non-suit and not wait until all of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence on all phases of his case has been introduced. The Act of March 11, 1875, P. L. 6, par. 1; 12 P. S. 645, provides: \u201cWhenever the defendant, upon the trial of a cause in any court of common pleas of this commonwealth, shall offer no evidence, it shall be lawful for the judge presiding at the trial to order a judgment of non-suit to be entered, if, in his opinion, the plaintiff shall have given no such evidence as in law is sufficient to maintain the action, with leave, nevertheless, to move the court in banc to set aside such judgment of non-suit; . .\nProcedural Rule 22J\u00a1, supra, which extends to all actions Rule 125 of the Courts of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (the latter rule being applicable only to cases of trespass), is not in conflict with the section of the Act of 1875 just quoted.\nThe order is affirmed."}
