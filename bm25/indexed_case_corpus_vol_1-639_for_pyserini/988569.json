{"id": "988569", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice SAYLOR.\nAppeal was allowed to consider whether a trial court presiding over a civil negligence case erred in refusing to bifurcate trial to avoid exposing jurors to information from which it could be inferred that the plaintiff may have received some compensation for his injuries from a collateral source.\nIn November of 1999, while working as an inventory picker in a warehouse operated by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (the \u201cPLCB\u201d), Appellee, John Gallagher, fell through an opening in an elevated walkway. He later commenced a negligence action against the PLCB; World Transportation, Inc., a logistical company that provided distribution and warehousing support to the PLCB; Appellant, Trans Freight Systems, Inc., which was also involved in the warehouse operations and which was World Transportation\u2019s parent corporation; and others. Among other injuries, Appellee claimed to have suffered a disabling brain injury.\nWorld Transportation and Appellant each asserted that it was Appellee\u2019s employer, and therefore, was immune from civil suit in the courts of law under the employer-immunity provisions of the Pennsylvania Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-1041, 2501-2626. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 481. Appellee made a pre-trial request pursuant to Pennsylvania Rule of Civil Procedure 213(b), styled as a motion in limine, to have the question of which entity was his employer and the remaining trial issues bifurcated and otherwise to prohibit the mention of workers\u2019 compensation during the proposed, separate general liability and damages proceedings. Appellant acknowledged that the collateral source rule precludes references to other sources of recovery that are deemed irrelevant at trial, in order to avoid the possibility that an improper inference by jurors of a double recovery on the plaintiffs part might diminish due and proper damages which would otherwise be assessed against the tortfeasor. See, e.g., Lobalzo v. Varoli, 409 Pa. 15, 21, 185 A.2d 557, 561(1962). Appellant contended, however, that such collateral source information is admissible for limited purposes where it has specific relevance to a liability issue in a civil case. In this regard, Appellant posited that its payment of workers\u2019 compensation premiums on Appellee\u2019s behalf tended to show that it was, in fact, Appellee\u2019s employer, and thus, not a proper party to the action. The trial court agreed with Appellant\u2019s position on this point and denied relief on the motion, but with the proviso that the \u201cparties may mention workers\u2019 compensation only to show that premiums were paid on behalf of plaintiff.\u201d See Reproduced Record (\u201cR.R.\u201d), at 286a; accord R.R., at 291a (reflecting the trial court\u2019s admonishment to counsel that \u201cany mention of a collateral source would be barred, any payments\u201d).\nDespite the trial court\u2019s ruling, in his opening statement, Appellant\u2019s counsel made specific reference to Appellee\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits, as follows:\n[H]ow will we show you that Trans Freight Systems was in fact the employer under the law of John Gallagher? ... Workers compensation benefits. How did Mr. Gallagher receive workers compensation benefits after this incident occurred? Trans Freight Systems paid the workers compensation benefits.\nR.R., at 308a-309a. Appellee\u2019s counsel did not assert a contemporaneous objection; however, after the jury retired for the day, the trial judge spoke with counsel and criticized the remark of Appellant\u2019s counsel as a violation of his ruling, as follows:\nThe Court: ... [TJhere was a comment in [Appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s] opening regarding workers\u2019 comp benefits. My ruling was only that your client or anybody could mention that they paid premiums on his behalf. It had nothing to do with him getting benefits. If you misunderstood\u2014\n[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: I did. I apologize, Your Honor.\nThe Court: He was carried on the books as an employee and they made payments for premiums. But that is it.\n[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: Okay. I apologize, Your Honor, if I misunderstood your ruling.\nSee R.R., at 322a-323a.\nPrior to the resumption of the trial the next day, Appellee\u2019s counsel expressed continuing concern regarding the effect of the opening remarks, and the trial court indicated its own discomfort in light of the recent decision of the Superior Court in Nigra v. Walsh, 797 A.2d 353 (Pa.Super.2002) (awarding a new trial on the basis that a defendant/motorist violated the collateral source rule by suggesting to the jury that the plaintiff/passenger was receiving federal disability benefits, and because it was impossible to determine the effect of such violation on the verdict). For this reason, the court granted Appellee\u2019s request to bar any and all references to workers\u2019 compensation, including premium payments. See R.R., at 337a-338a (reflecting the trial court\u2019s indication \u201cI am very happy to just eliminate any issue with respect to the premiums, with respect to the benefits[;] [y]ou will have to prove employment another way\u201d). The court subsequently stated to the jurors:\nFolks, I forgot to mention before we started. In one of the opening statements yesterday, there was some mention of workers comp benefits. Please disregard that. That has no place in this case and should not in any way be considered by you in your deciding this case.\nR.R., at 410a-411a.\nNonetheless, the subject of workers\u2019 compensation resurfaced during the cross-examination of Appellee\u2019s father, who was asked by Appellant\u2019s counsel about his son having \u201chad several prior workers\u2019 compensation or work related injuries.\u201d R.R., at 425a. Appellee\u2019s counsel objected and moved for a mistrial in an interchange that proceeded as follows:\n[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: Motion for [a mistrial], Your Honor, reluctantly. Even if we didn\u2019t have the issues in this case that we have related to employment, in the limited rulings you made about allowing information about workers compensation premiums.\nThe Court: That\u2019s changed.\n[Appellee\u2019s Counsel]: I understand that. We\u2019re still, I think, entitled to a [mistrial].\nMy recollection is on Monday after opening you once again said or you said, defense counsel not to mention workers compensation benefits. That was not the scope of your ruling. We now have workers compensation coming in again, and it was phrased as other or additional, I forgot which words preceded workers compensation claims. I reluctantly, believe me, very reluctantly, I move for a [mistrial].\n[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: Your Honor, the question was, it was immediately rephrased. It was a prior work related injury. The Court: No. No. That\u2019s not what you said. You used the term workers compensation.\n[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: Your Honor, that was done\u2014\nThe Court: Was this another mistake?\n[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: Your Honor, that was done in error. I indicated immediately, I rephrased it to say work related injury. I don\u2019t think this is an indication that a [mistrial] is appropriate. Clearly, it was immediately rephrased and it was in no way altering the facts of this case. And to address the issue of a [mistrial] is really, I think, not appropriate at this juncture.\nThe Court: Your comment was not appropriate. You have to watch what you\u2019re saying.\nR.R., at 428a-429a, 456a-57a; see also R.R., at 425 (reflecting counsel\u2019s initial objection). The trial court denied the mistrial motion.\nLater in the trial, apparently acting sua sponte, the trial court reconsidered its ruling barring the admission of evidence of workers\u2019 compensation premium payments made by Appellant. See R.R., at 415a. At this juncture, the court indicated:\nI think I was too hasty in precluding mention of the payment of premiums. So I am going to reverse myself on that. But it\u2019s only the payment of premiums.\n[Appellant\u2019s Counsel]: Correct, Your Honor.\nThe Court: I just think that is an element that has to be part of the evidence in this case. My original ruling was that it could come in. I think I overreacted on that. I will let that in.\nR.R., at 455a-456a. The court thus permitted Appellant\u2019s former vice president of operations to testify that Appellant had in fact paid the workers\u2019 compensation premiums for employees at the PLCB warehouse facility. See R.R., at 571a. On Appellee\u2019s request, the trial court instructed the jurors:\nFolks, I do want to remind you that you have heard the term workers compensation. That has nothing to do with any damage which may or may not be awarded by you in this case. You are to put that out of your mind. It is being introduced only on the issue of who employed Mr. Gallagher.\nR.R., at 571a.\nAfter the close of the evidence, World Transportation moved for a directed verdict on the employer-immunity ground. Counsel for Appellant and Appellee ultimately agreed that the trial court had the authority to decide the issue, see R.R., at 626a, and the court ruled that World Transportation was, and Appellant was not, Appellee\u2019s employer. See R.R., at 641a-642a. The remaining issues were submitted to the jury, which returned a verdict for Appellee in the amount of $150,000, finding that Appellant and the PLCB each bore 40 percent responsibility for the causal negligence, and allocating 20 percent of the responsibility to Appellee.\nAppellee filed post-trial motions, asserting, inter alia, that the trial court erred in failing to bifurcate adjudication of the employer identification question and the other trial issues, failing to grant a mistrial after Appellant\u2019s counsel referred to Appellee\u2019s other or additional workers\u2019 compensation claims, and allowing Appellant\u2019s counsel to make other references to workers\u2019 compensation (presumably the remark in his opening statement) in the trial.\nThe trial court denied relief, reiterating its position that the evidence of premium payments was relevant to the employer identification issue, and thus, the decision whether to admit it, and whether to bifurcate, was committed to its sound discretion. In this regard, the court indicated that, on balancing considerations of judicial economy and fairness, it had concluded that bifurcation and/or exclusion was unnecessary. The court recognized that the evidentiary limitation couched as the collateral source rule derives from the substantive doctrine of damages law prescribing that payments from a collateral source do not diminish the damages otherwise recoverable from the tortfeasor. See id. at 6 (citing Johnson v. Beane, 541 Pa. 449, 664 A.2d 96, 100 (1995)); accord Beechwoods Flying Service, Inc. v. Al Hamilton Contracting Corp., 504 Pa. 618, 625, 476 A.2d 350, 353 (1984) (explaining that the collateral source rule was \u201cintended to prevent a wrongdoer from taking advantage of the fortuitous existence of a collateral remedy\u201d). The court, however, distinguished decisions in which collateral source references were absolutely proscribed on the ground that the reviewing courts had discerned no nexus between the collateral source recovery and relevant liability issues in those cases; whereas, in the present case, the workers\u2019 compensation premium payments were in fact relevant to the contested question of which defendant employed Appellee. The trial court noted that it had crafted its ruling narrowly to bar any discussion of actual benefits payment from the evidence, thereby ameliorating the potential for jury confusion with which the decisional law was concerned. Moreover, it found that its cautionary and remedial instructions to the jurors served to alleviate undue prejudice.\nUpon the resolution of the post-trial motions, the verdict was molded to reflect an adjustment relative to the component attributed to Appellee\u2019s negligence, as well as the addition of delay damages, and judgment was entered in favor of Appellee and against Appellant in the amount of $122,412.73.\nOn Appellee\u2019s subsequent appeal from such judgment, the Superior Court reversed in a divided, memorandum decision, holding that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing collateral source evidence to infect the liability and damages phase of the trial, the error, caused prejudice, and a new trial was due. See Gallagher v. PLCB, No. 3209 EDA 2002, slip op. at 7, 841 A.2d 582 (Pa.Super.Nov.13, 2003). The majority decision centered on the first two challenges raised by Appellee, in which he alleged that the trial court erred in denying his bifurcation motion. In addressing bifurcation, the majority highlighted the prior decisions focusing on the general irrelevancy of collateral source payments to the issues in a civil case and manifesting concern over unwarranted conclusions on the part of jurors. See id. at 5-6 (citing, for example, Boudwin v. Yellow Cab Co., 410 Pa. 31, 188 A.2d 259 (1963) (plurality) (\u201c[A] tortfeasor may not ride to immunity from his wrong on the back of worker\u2019s compensation paid by someone else.\u201d)). According to the majority,\nThe failure to separate the issue relating to the identify of the employer from liability necessarily allowed evidence of workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage into the jury\u2019s collective mind. The trial court\u2019s cautionary instruction to the jury and explanation in its opinion that workers\u2019 compensation coverage was admitted solely for purposes of identifying the employer illustrates the initial error committed\u2014had the court bifurcated the trial, there would have been no need to caution the jury as to the purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation insurance evidence.\nGallagher, slip op. at 6.\nAlthough the Superior Court majority acknowledged the trial court\u2019s efforts to narrowly constrain the presentation of evidence touching on workers\u2019 compensation, it emphasized that the jurors were nevertheless subsequently informed of the fact of collateral source payments. Id. at 7. The majority described the discerned violation of the collateral source rule as \u201cthe residual error of the trial court\u2019s refusal to bifurcate the trial\u201d and concluded that, because the testimony that it found to have been improperly admitted may have affected the verdict, the appropriate remedy was a new trial. Id. at 7 (quoting Nigra, 797 A.2d at 356).\nJudge Beck authored the dissenting opinion, in which she observed that evidence of compensation from collateral sources has routinely been permitted to establish material facts or for other evidentiary purposes that are not directly related to the plaintiff\u2019s recovery, and generally can be accomplished without mention of actual payment. See Gallagher, slip op. at 1 (Beck, J., dissenting) (citing Beechwoods Flying Service, 504 Pa. at 623-24, 476 A.2d at 353 (holding that evidence of the procurement by a plaintiff of insurance against property damage was admissible in bailment case where it related to an element of the bailment contract); Capozi v. Hearst Pub. Co., 371 Pa. 503, 92 A.2d 177 (1952) (holding that evidence of a defendant\u2019s maintenance of liability insurance, although usually irrelevant and prejudicial, may be admitted into evidence where relevance can be established)). Judge Beck reasoned that, in such instances, the probative value of admitting such evidence may be deemed to outweigh any prejudice to the plaintiff. See id. at 2. For this reason, and in light of the trial court\u2019s narrowly crafted ruling on admissibility and associated admonitions to the jurors, Judge Beck would have credited the court\u2019s assessment of relevance, as well as its discretionary decision to deny bifurcation based on its balancing of the interests involved. See id. at 2-3.\nThis Court allowed appeal, limited to the issue of:\nApplying the standards for appellate review set forth in Harman v. Borah, 562 Pa. 455, 756 A.2d 1116 (2000), and considering the scope of a trial court\u2019s discretion under the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence, did the Superior Court err in reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of Gallagher\u2019s motion for a new trial based on its conclusion that the collateral source rule had been violated and without consideration of actual prejudice, when the evidence of payments from a collateral source was relevant to the jury\u2019s determination as to which of two defendants was Gallagher\u2019s employer and the trial court gave a cautionary instruction to the jury that the evidence should be used only for that limited purpose.\nPresently, the parties\u2019 arguments are divided along the lines of the respective opinions of the Superior Court majority and dissent. Appellant highlights that the testimony the jurors heard relating to the employer identity issue was brief and expressly limited in scope, and the jurors never heard actual evidence of benefits payments. Appellant also notes that the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence reflect the broad discretion that is vested in trial judges and specifically contemplate that limiting instructions may be given to structure the introduction of limited-purpose evidence and prevent reversible error, see Pa.R.E. 105, and criticizes the opinion of the Superior Court holding as being tantamount to an unwarranted -per se rule precluding the admission of material evidence. As concerns its counsel\u2019s opening remarks, Appellant observes that no contemporaneous objection was asserted, and therefore, claims that any challenge to the remarks has been waived. Moreover, Appellant maintains that the court\u2019s remedial charge was adequate to cure any prejudice, and, in any event, the return of a substantial damages award negates any possibility that prejudice actually ensued.\nAppellee characterizes the Superior Court majority\u2019s holding as merely exemplifying mainstream enforcement of the strong and long-standing prohibition against introducing evidence of a collateral source. According to Appellee, the subject of workers\u2019 compensation is so inherently prejudicial that errors in permitting references to it cannot be corrected by simple admonishments to jurors to ignore the topic. In this regard, Appellant points to some of the more forceful statements of this Court which have arisen in various contexts. Additionally, Appellee disputes the relevance of the premium payments to the employer identity issue, noting that the question of employment status is one of law, which turns on the exercise, or the right to exercise, control. Furthermore, even if it were to be determined that there was a disputed factual question as to which premium payments could be deemed relevant, Appellee\u2019s position is that the court was bound to implement bifurcation to prevent the possibility of taint, particularly since an employer, as a matter of law, cannot be a party in a personal injury action brought by an employee against a negligent third party. See Heckendorn v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 502 Pa. 101, 109, 465 A.2d 609, 613 (1983). Appellee also complains that the trial court did not truly exercise discretion in its refusal to bifurcate, since, in Appellee\u2019s view, the court failed to take into account that the duration of the trial was actually increased by the non-severance approach, and that bifurcation would have thwarted what Appellee describes as a conscious attempt on the part of Appellant\u2019s counsel to place workers\u2019 compensation in the forefront of the jurors\u2019 minds via pretextual means. Appellee contends that prejudice is apparent in light of the relatively modest compensation award, as contrasted with the damages case that he presented to the jurors.\nOn the issue that the Superior Court decided, namely the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling on bifurcation, we are in alignment with the position of Judge Beck. The decision whether to bifurcate is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court, which is in the best position to evaluate the necessity for such measures. See Stevenson v. General Motors Corp., 513 Pa. 411, 422-23, 521 A.2d 413, 419 (1987) (reviewing a refusal to bifurcate under an abuse of discretion standard). That Appellee presents a different perspective than that of the trial court concerning the time and resources that two hypothesized proceedings would have consumed as compared with the single one that in fact ensued is unpersuasive, since Appellee offers nothing concrete that would cause us to question or disturb the trial court\u2019s comparative judgment in this regard.\nFurther, as Judge Beck noted, this Court has followed the majority view that, although evidence of a plaintiffs recovery from collateral sources is generally inadmissible and improper references may warrant a mistrial, an exception exists if the evidence of such recovery is relevant to a material issue in the case. See, e.g., Beechwoods Flying Service, 504 Pa. at 623-24, 476 A.2d at 353; DeVita v. Durst, 167 Pa. Cmwlth. 105, 116, 647 A.2d 636, 641 (1994) (\u201cCourts have found evidence of insurance permissible where it is relevant to the issue in a case.\u201d (citation omitted)). This exception is analogous to that which pertains, under the Rules of Evidence, to evidence of liability insurance maintained by a defendant. Judge Beck appropriately distinguished decisions such as Boudwin, Lobalzo, and Nigra on the ground that, in each of those cases, the collateral source evidence was found to lack relevance or materiality relative to the issues presented at trial. See Boudwin, 410 Pa. at 36-37, 188 A.2d at 261; Lobalzo, 409 Pa. at 17, 185 A.2d at 559 (citation omitted); cf. Nigra, 797 A.2d at 358-59 (finding that, while federal disability benefits may have had some relevance the trial issues, the fact of their receipt by the plaintiff was improperly developed and highlighted by the defense).\nWe agree with Appellee that the matter of employment status is ultimately a question of law, and, where the facts are undisputed, it may be decided by the trial court without the necessity of fact finding. See JFC Temps, Inc. v. WCAB (Lindsay and G & B Packing), 545 Pa. 149, 153, 680 A.2d 862, 864 (1996). However, this is ordinarily accomplished via a dispositive pre-trial motion, such as a motion for full or partial summary judgment. See, e.g., Mullins v. Sun Co., 763 A.2d 398, 399-401 & n. 3 (Pa.Super.2000). But in this case, although it appears that the relevant facts concerning the employment issue were largely undisputed, Appellee did not seek partial summary judgment to gain a global, pre-trial disposition of the question. Accordingly, we discern no abuse of discretion or error of law in the court\u2019s apparent understanding that the facts may have been in dispute and, correspondingly, in its decision to proceed with the fact finding process. See generally JFC Temps, 545 Pa. at 153, 680 A.2d at 864 (\u201cthe question of whether an employer-employee relationship exists is one of law, based upon findings of fact.\u201d (citation omitted; emphasis added)). Furthermore, we agree with the trial court that the payment of workers\u2019 compensation premiums, while certainly not dispositive, was a potentially relevant consideration in determining the identity of the employer. As Appellant highlights, contemporaneous with the trial court\u2019s decision on bifurcation, the court issued a carefully crafted order designed to allow the evidence for its probative effect while diminishing the prejudicial impact.\nBased on the foregoing, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s decision on bifurcation, which was the subject of Appellee\u2019s first two issues raised in his appeal and was the expressed basis for the Superior Court\u2019s disposition. Appellee seeks to conflate (and to some degree it appears that the Superior Court majority reasoning conflated) the bifurcation decision with the two instances in which Appellant\u2019s counsel affirmatively violated the trial court\u2019s pre-trial order by referencing workers\u2019 compensation matters other than the payment of premiums by Appellant to establish an employment relationship. At the time that the court issued its pre-trial order, however, it was entitled to expect that its straightforward ruling limiting references to workers\u2019 compensation would be respected and implemented by counsel. We decline, therefore, to inject considerations arising from hindsight into review of the sustainability of the pre-trial order as such. While counsel\u2019s subsequent violations may give rise to redress in their own right, they have little bearing on the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling on bifurcation in the first instance.\nIn light of our holding that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to bifurcate the employer identification question and other trial issues in this case, the Superior Court\u2019s order is vacated, and the matter is remanded for consideration of the remaining issues that were raised and properly presented in the appeal to the Superior Court.\nJustice BAER files a dissenting opinion in which Justice NEWMAN joins.\n. In this regard, the Court relied on the fact that World Transportation maintained the contract relative to logistical operations at the warehouse with the PLCB; the relevant licenses necessary to carry out the contract; and actual, day-to-day control over the employees. See R.R., at 641a.\n. Appellant and the PLCB also filed post-trial motions. Appellant, however, did not pursue the issues that it raised in such motion on appeal, and the PLCB withdrew its claims for relief after reaching a settlement with Appellee.\n. Parenthetically, via the Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Act, Act of March 20, 2002, P.L. 154, No. 13, the General Assembly has negated the substantive collateral source doctrine in medical professional liability actions. See 40 P.S. \u00a7 1303.508.\n. Those two issues were framed as follows:\nWhether the trial court erred as a matter of law in denying Plaintiffs Motion in Limine for bifurcation/severance of the employer issue particularly where the likelihood that payment or receipt of workers compensation benefits would be injected into the case.\nWhether the trial court erred as a matter of law in denying Plaintiff's Motion in Limine to preclude evidence of receipt/payment of workers compensation benefits and in allowing defense counsel to ask about receipt of such benefits and payment of workers compensation benefits and premiums.\nGallagher, slip op. at 4.\n. See, e.g., Lobalzo, 409 Pa. at 21, 185 A.2d at 561 (indicating, upon finding irrelevant references to a plaintiff's receipt of workers\u2019 compensation benefits combined with a misleading jury charge issued by the trial court, that \"[w]hen an error in a trial is of such a consequence that, like a dash of ink in a can of milk, it cannot be strained out, the only remedy, so that justice may not ingest a tainted fare, is a new trial\u201d); Lengle v. North Lebanon Twp., 274 Pa. 51, 53, 117 A. 403, 404 (1922) (observing that, once the matter of payment or receipt of workers' compensation benefits was put before a jury in a case in which it has no relevance \u201d[c]orrective instructions had little chance to get this idea out of the jurors\u2019 minds\u201d); cf. Boudwin, 410 Pa. at 33, 188 A.2d at 260 (reflecting a plurality statement that \u201c[\u00a1judges should be vigilant, in personal injury trespass cases, to keep out of the trial all references to benefits collaterally received by the plaintiff.\u201d).\n. Accord 22 Am.Jur.2d Damages \u00a7 763 (2004) (\"[E]vidence that the plaintiff was compensated by a collateral source for all or a portion of the damages caused by defendant\u2019s wrongful act is generally inadmissible, although an exception exists if the evidence of payment from a collateral source is relevant to some other material issue in the case.\u201d (footnotes omitted)); 88 C.J.S. Trial \u00a7 138 (2004) (\u201d[T]he fact that the plaintiff is insured or otherwise indemnified may be shown where it is a material issue in the case, or where it is brought out as an incident to the proof of some other fact properly involved, as, for example, employment!.]\u201d (footnotes omitted)).\nWe recognize that some jurisdictions do maintain a per se rule against the admission of collateral source evidence. See, e.g., Proctor v. Castelletti, 112 Nev. 88, 911 P.2d 853, 854 (1996). Notably, while this Court has rejected a per se approach, it has taken a comparatively narrow view on the issue of when collateral source payments are relevant. Compare 2 Stein on Personal Injury Damages \u00a7 13:14 (3d ed. 2004) (\"Under the liberal view, evidence of collateral payments is admissible, at least in the trial court\u2019s discretion, to show malingering.\u201d), -with Boudwin, 410 Pa. at 36, 188 A.2d at 261 (reflecting a refusal to cognize the use of collateral source evidence to establish malingering), and Lobalzo, 409 Pa. at 20, 185 A.2d at 560 (same, with respect to attempted use of collateral source evidence for general impeachment purposes).\n. See Pa.R.E. 411 (\u201cEvidence that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon the issue whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of insurance against liability when offered for another purpose, such as proof of agency, ownership, or control, or bias or prejudice of a witness.\").\nThe collateral source rule as such is not specifically developed in the Rules of Evidence, but is referenced in a comment to Rule 402 as an exclusionary precept that is not abrogated by the Rules\u2019 adoption.\n. Appellant did file a motion for summary judgment based on the employer-immunity statute, but obviously the trial court was not disposed to grant relief in its favor based on the facts presented. See supra note 1.\n. In any event, Appellee\u2019s present position on this point was not maintained before the trial court. Rather, at trial, his counsel confessed confusion regarding the issue, as follows:\nI've looked over some cases. I must admit I've not looked over them completely. I\u2019m not a hundred percent sure. I've seen some cases that say that ultimately determination of who\u2019s an employer is a legal issue. If the facts are in dispute they go to the jury. But I\u2019ve never seen it done in a liability case like this, number one. And number two, I don\u2019t know what facts you ask the jury to resolve. I just don't know. I was puzzling over that last night. And I still don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think the jury gets asked who\u2019s the employer because that\u2019s the legal issue. But short of that, what questions can a jury resolve that then the court can rule on as a matter of law, I\u2019m somewhat at the moment befuddled.\nR.R., at 451a-452a.\n. Accord McLandrich v. Southern Cal. Edison Co., 917 F.Supp. 723, 731 (S.D.Cal.1996) (identifying as a putative employer's payment of workers\u2019 compensation premiums as a relevant consideration in determining the existence of an employment relationship); Lankford v. Gulf Lumber Co., 597 So.2d 1340, 1345 (Ala.1992) (same); Johnson Timber Corp. v. Sturdivant, 295 Ark. 622, 752 S.W.2d 241, 247 (1988) (\" 'Payment of workers\u2019 compensation insurance premiums is evidence relating to the status as employer-employee[.]\u201d); cf. 3 Larson's Workers' Compensation Law \u00a7 63.04[2], at 63-7 (1999) (discussing the limited role of insurance premium payments in determining employment status, describing such as \"at most persuasive\u201d).\n. In K.H. v. J.R., 573 Pa. 481, 826 A.2d 863 (2003), the general rule was expressed that a notice of appeal filed from the entry of judgment is viewed as drawing into question any prior non-final orders that produced the judgment. See id. at 493-94, 826 A.2d at 871. It was therefore an available choice for Appellee, having filed a notice of appeal relative to the final judgment, to challenge the trial court\u2019s bifurcation ruling as such. However, the proper review in such instance is obviously centered on an examination of the record for abuse of discretion as of the time that the bifurcation ruling was made, rather than from an end-of-trial perspective.\nNotably, the principles governing appellate review of a trial court\u2019s resolution of a motion for a new trial overlap with the review standard pertaining to the trial court\u2019s pre-trial order and, obviously, further subsume an assessment of the appropriate remedy where an abuse of discretion or error of law is discerned. See Harman v. Borah, 562 Pa. 455, 467, 756 A.2d 1116, 1122 (2000).\n. There are significant issues connected with whether or not Appellee may secure relief based on these violations which, in light of the Superior Court's approach, have not yet been addressed. For example, with regard to counsel's opening remarks, Appellant raised a waiver issue based upon the failure of Appellee\u2019s counsel to assert a contemporaneous objection. See Brief of Appellee (Superior Court), at 7, 13-14. As another example, with respect to the reference to workers\u2019 compensation arising during the cross-examination of Appellee\u2019s father, an at least moderately distinct analysis should apply, since this was not a collateral source reference relative to the present case, as no recovery for the injuries in question was implied."}
