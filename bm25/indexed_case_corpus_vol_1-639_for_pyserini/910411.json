{"id": "910411", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe defendant was tried upon an indictment found regularly by the grand jury upon examination of witnesses after information made before a magistrate. A trial was had upon the merits and the defendant was duly convicted of murder of tbe first degree. On the trial a motion was made to quash the indictment because it was not found after an information sworn to and subscribed before the committing magistrate. While the defendant might have been heard on that subject upon a proceeding to be discharged from custody on the ground of an illegal commitment, it is certainly too late after indictment found upon the trial of the cause. The finding of the indictment cannot be invalidated for any such reason.\nThe judgment is affirmed and the record is remitted for the purpose of execution according to law."}
