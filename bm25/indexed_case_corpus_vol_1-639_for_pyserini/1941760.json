{"id": "1941760", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThomas L. Beggy (decedent), an Allegheny County resident, died testate on June 11,1970, leaving the residue of his estate to his brother, Edward Beggy.\nDecedent and his brother, Edward Beggy, together with a cousin, a Mrs. Burke, had lived together for many years. In decedent\u2019s safe deposit box were found thirty-two (32) U. S. Series \u201cE\u201d savings bonds valued at $2622.12 registered in the names of decedent or Edward Beggy, said bonds having been issued between September 1965 and August, 1969. This safe deposit box was in decedent\u2019s name only and the keys thereto were kept in decedent\u2019s possession. The record indicates that, subsequent to his retirement in 1963, Edward Beggy received monthly checks of $120.60 from Social Security, $50.00 from the Pittsburgh Press and $11.00 from the International Union; most of the Social Security and retirement checks were turned over by Edward Beggy to and handled by decedent; that at least a substantial part, if not all, of the purchase money of the bonds came from Edward Beggy.\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania appraised and sought to tax at full value the amount of these bonds and the estate appealed to the Orphans\u2019 Court division of the Common Pleas Court of Allegheny County on the ground that the bonds should be subject to taxation at only one-half of the full value. After a hearing, the court entered a decree holding that the bonds were taxable at one-half of their full value. The Commonwealth has appealed from that decree.\nTaxation of jointly held property is generally controlled by the provisions of the Pennsylvania Inheritance and Estate Tax Act of 1961. Section 241 of that statute provides: \u201cJoint Tenancy\u2014When any property is held in the names of two or more persons, or is deposited in a financial institution in the names of two or more persons, so that, upon the death of one of them, the survivor or survivors have a right to the immediate ownership or possession and enjoyment of the whole property, the accrual of such right, upon the death of one of them, shall be deemed a transfer subject to tax under this Act, of a fractional portion of such property to be determined by dividing the value of the whole property by the number of joint tenants in existence immediately preceding the death of the deceased joint tenant. This section shall not apply to property and interests in property passing by right of survivorship to the survivor of husband and wife. If the co-ownership was created in contemplation of death, within the meaning of Section 222 of this Act, the entire interest so transferred shall be subject to tax only under Section 222, as though a part of the estate of the person who created the co-ownership.\u201d\nWe believe that the ruling and rationale of this Court in Myers Estate, 359 Pa. 577, 60 A. 2d 50 (1948), controls the case at bar. In Myers, the decedent had a safe deposit box held in his name and that of his mother; after decedent\u2019s death, U. S. savings bonds valued at f20,250 were found in this safe deposit box; these bonds had been purchased with decedent\u2019s funds and were registered in the name of decedent or his sister. The Commonwealth appraised the bonds for inheritance tax purposes at their full value. On an appeal by the sister, the court below held that the \u201cfull appraised value of the bonds which devolved to [the sister were] subject to a transfer inheritance tax\u201d and this Court affirmed that decree. The rationale in Myers was that the decedent had retained custody of and exercised complete control over the bonds-\u2014i.e., the sister had no access to the box-\u2014and that, while the bonds under the federal regulations were legally redeemable by either the decedent or his sister, the sister\u2019s right of redemption was incapable of performance since the decedent had not irrevocably parted with the possession of the bonds bnt had retained exclusive control of them. This Court stated, inter alia: \u201cBoth [the sister\u2019s] possession and enjoyment of the bonds in question were postponed until the donor\u2019s death since no previous access to them was made available to her. To permit a transfer inheritance tax exemption on all government bonds issued in the co-ownership form without examining the circumstances of each case, would encourage the practice of investing one\u2019s estate in such bonds and registering them in joint names for the purpose of circumventing the payment of a legitimate exaction.\u201d (p. 582).\nIn the case at bar, Edward Beggy, just as the decedent\u2019s sister in Myers, had neither possession nor enjoyment of the bonds and had no access to the safe deposit box in which the bonds were kept. However, it is urged by appellee that the case at bar is distinguishable from Myers in that Edward Beggy\u2019s own money purchased the bonds. The fact that Edward Beggy\u2019s money may have contributed in whole or in part to the purchase of these bonds is of no moment. See: Cochrane\u2019s Estate, 342 Pa. 108, 20 A. 2d 305 (1941); Commonwealth v. Nolan\u2019s Estate, 345 Pa. 98, 26 A. 2d 308 (1942); Graham Estate, 358 Pa. 383, 57 A. 2d 853 (1948).\nAppellee also urges that Myers has been either overruled or limited in its application to bonds purchased by a decedent with his own funds by Horstman Estate, 398 Pa. 506, 159 A. 2d 514 (1960). In Horstman, we dealt only with the question of ownership of U. S. savings bonds after the death of one of the registered joint owners; in the case at bar, we are not concerned with the question of ownership of the bonds\u2014Edward Beggy, the surviving joint tenant, is concededly the owner of the bonds in question\u2014but rather the extent of taxability of the value of the bonds. Horstman stands solely for the proposition that, in view of the U. S. treasury regulations governing the issuance of savings bonds, a surviving co-owner becomes the sole owner of the bonds as a third party beneficiary of the contract made by the bond purchaser with the U. S. government.\nUnfortunately for Edward Beggy, the instant bonds were kept in the sole possession of the decedent until he died and, that being so, the transfer of ownership in the bonds took place only after decedent\u2019s death; upon such transfer, the Commonwealth properly placed a tax based on the full value of the bonds. Cf. Chadrow, Executor v. Kellman, 378 Pa. 237, 106 A. 2d 594 (1954); Zecary Estate, 407 Pa. 162, 180 A. 2d 572 (1962); Kantner Estate, 3 Fiduciary Rep. 81 (1952) ; Tunnell Estate, 17 Fiduciary Rep. 308 (1967) ; Schablein Estate, 68 Pa. D. & C. 634 (1949).\nDecree reversed. Each party to pay own costs.\nMr. Chief Justice Beuu took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nEdward Beggy did testify that he believed that he could have had access to the box, if he so desired, but he had never sought access.\nJudge Hat filed a dissenting opinion.\nAct of June 15, 1961, P. L. 373, art. II, \u00a7241, 72 P.S. \u00a72485-241\nMyers was decided when the Act of July 14, 1936, P. L. 44, 72 P.S. 2301 was in effect. The 1961 statute repealed the 1936 statute but the provisions of both statutes are strikingly similar."}
