{"id": "1271010", "contents": "Opinion\nPee Curiam,\nThe decree of the Court below is affirmed on the following excerpts from the adjudication and opinion of President Judge Valentine:\n\u201cThis case involves the validity of a tax sale of plaintiffs\u2019 personal property, which was assessed and sold as real estate.\n\u201cThe jurisdiction of equity was sustained by Judge Flannery in opinion filed March 9th, 1955 (45 Luzerne 149).\n\u201cThe buildings involved, viz., a cinder processing plant, a frame dwelling, a frame building and a garage were erected upon real estate owned by the Pennsylvania Power & Light Company.\n\u201cFor the years 1950, 1951 and 1952, these buildings were assessed in the name of \u2018T. F. Steele Coal Company.\u2019 In 1953, the assessment was changed to \u2018E. Miller Co., P. P. & L. Co., co-owner, c/o Curtis Rodgers, Harwood Mines, Hazle Township.\u2019\n\u201cThe buildings were exposed for sale for the nonpayment of taxes for the year 1950, and due to the fact that no bids were received were acquired by the County of Luzerne.\n\u201cThe T. F. Steele Coal Company was in no way connected with plaintiffs\u2019 operation at Harwood. It never owned, leased or occupied the premises, nor was it, at any time, plaintiffs\u2019 agent or representative.\n\u201cThe plaintiffs, trading as H. Hessey Miller, began the operation of the cinder processing plant at Harwood in 1946. Since that time plaintiffs\u2019 foreman and his family have occupied the dwelling house erected at said operation.\n\u201cH. Hessey Miller was a trade name adopted in April, 1943, by a partnership consisting of H. Hessey Miller, Dorothea B. Miller, Helena Foulke, Kirk Foulke and William G. Bower, for the purpose of buying, selling and dealing in cinder and cinder products. The address or office of the partnership was Front and Franklin Streets, Chester, Pa.\n\u201cThe Millers withdrew from the partnership in February, 1944, and duly filed certificates to that effect.\n\u201cThereafter the three plaintiffs continued the partnership under the trade name of \u2018H. Hessey Miller\u2019 and established the cinder plant at Harwood, Luzerne County.\n\u201cOn June 23rd, 1953, one of the plaintiffs, William G. Bower, wrote the Tax Claim Bureau requesting a bill for any taxes due from the plaintiffs. This letter was upon stationery which set forth \u2018Kirk Eoulke, Helena Eoulke and William G. Bower, trading as H. Hessey Miller, Delaware Ave., and Elower St., Chester, Pa.\u2019\n\u201cIn response to this letter, the Tax Claim Bureau wrote Bower, under date of August 13th, 1953, enclosing a statement of taxes due from the T. E. Steele Coal Company, not indicating what, if any, taxes were due from the plaintiffs, trading as H. Hessey Miller.\n\u201cThereafter, on November 5 th, 1953, the Tax Claim Bureau petitioned to sell the property, free and clear from all taxes, liens, etc.\n\u201cThe rule to show cause why such sale should not be authorized was served by the Sheriff of Delaware County, deputized by the Sheriff of Luzerne County on H. Hessey Miller at Middletown Road, Middletown Township, Delaware County, Pa., but no service was made upon any of the plaintiffs, trading as H. Hessey Miller, nor any of their authorized agents.\n\u201cH. Hessey Miller never had an interest in plaintiffs\u2019 operation at Harwood, and neither his name or the place of the service of the rule upon him appeared either in the files of the Tax Claim Bureau or the Assessors Office.\n\u201cAt the time of the service of the rule upon H. Hessey Miller, the plaintiffs were involved in litigation with him over his right to engage in competition with them. (See Foulke v. Miller, 381 Pa. 587.)\n\u201cThe Tax Claim Bureau file contained the street address of plaintiffs\u2019 office in Chester and also plaintiffs\u2019 address at the Harwood plant.\n\u201cOn March 23rd, 1954, the property was allegedly sold at a free and clear tax sale to the defendant, Breakstone, for $66.55. Following this sale the Tax Claim Burean delivered to Breakstone an alleged deed for the property. Thereafter Breakstone delivered an alleged quit-claim deed, transferring the property to the defendant, Albert.\n\u201cThe case presents two controlling questions of law. First, the sufficiency of the assessment to support a tax sale of plaintiffs\u2019 property. Second, the legality of the sendee of the rule to show cause why the property should not be sold free and clear of all taxes and liens.\n\u201cThe situation was stated by Judge Flannery in his opinion disposing of the preliminary objection as follows: \u2018Between the plaintiffs and the taxing authorities the processing plant will have all the attributes of real estate and may be sold for taxes. Between the owner and the defendants it is personal property.\u2019 (45 Luzerne, 149-151)\n\u201cThe processing plant was never assessed in the name of plaintiffs. Taxes on the real estate, upon which plaintiffs\u2019 buildings had been erected, were duly paid by the owner, the Pennsylvania Power & Light Company.\n\u201cThe T. F. Steele Coal Company, in which name the plaintiffs\u2019 property was assessed, was in no way connected with plaintiffs\u2019 operation, or the land upon which plaintiffs\u2019buildings were erected.\n\u201cUnder the circumstances we conclude that the assessment was invalid and insufficient to support a sale of the property for the non-payment of taxes. Gordon v. Harley, 165 Pa. Superior Ct. 433. As stated in the more recent case of Luther v. Pa. Game Com., 381 Pa. 442, at page 445, \u2018The owner of real estate cannot have it taken away from him by the making of an assessment in the name of somebody whose title is entirely spurious, which assessment gives no notice that the true owner\u2019s property is being assessed.\u2019\n\u201cA tax sale, based on an assessment in the name of T. F. Steele Coal Company, for that which the Company never owned, possessed or occupied, can convey no title to property owned by the plaintiffs.\n\u201cWe are also of the opinion that the service of the rule to show cause why a sale of the property in question should not be made free and clear of all taxes and liens upon H. Hessey Miller, who was at no time interested in the operation of the plaintiffs at Harwood, was a nullity. Hess v. WesterwiCk, 366 Pa. 90. Due process of law inhibits the taking of one man\u2019s property and giving it to another contrary to settled usage and modes of procedure and without notice or an opportunity for a hearing. Hess v. Westerwick, supra.\n\u201cThe fact that the plaintiffs had no knowledge of the contemplated sale rendered the same basically invalid. Ross Appeal, 366 Pa. 100.\n\u201c. . . it is ordered, adjudged and decreed as follows:\n\u201c. . . That the alleged deed from the Tax Claim Bureau of Luzerne County, to the defendant, Albert Breakstone, recorded in the Recorder of Deeds Office in and for Luzerne County, in Deed Book No. 1235, at Page 205, and the alleged quit-claim deed from the defendant, Albert Breakstone, to the defendant, George Albert, recorded in the Recorder of Deed Office in and for Luzerne County, in Deed Book 1236, at page 530, are null and void and of no effect.\n\u201c. . . That the Recorder of Deeds in and for Luzerne County, note upon the margin of the pages of records of said alleged deeds the entry of this Decree.\n\u201cThat the respective parties pay their own costs.\u201d\nDecree affirmed."}
