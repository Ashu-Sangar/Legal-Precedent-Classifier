{"id": "4184472", "contents": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nThe Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (the \u201cUTPCPL\u201d or \u201cAct\u201d) provides a private cause of action to any person who, as a result of conduct that the UTPCPL prohibits, \u201csuffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal.\u201d 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-9.2(a). The Superior Court held here that Appellee Christina Grimes\u2019s retention of counsel to institute this suit constituted such an \u201cascertainable loss.\u201d We reverse.\nThe facts, which we have taken from Appellee\u2019s pleadings, are as follows. Appellee signed a contract in December 2010, to rent a car from Appellant Enterprise Leasing Company of Philadelphia, LLC (\u201cEnterprise\u201d). She agreed in the contract that she would pay for repairs for any damage the car incurred during the rental period, along with any administrative, loss-of-use, and diminishment-in-value fees. The contract set forth formulas for calculating the loss-of-use and diminishment-in-value fees. It also contained a power-of-attorney clause allowing Enterprise to request payment for any unpaid \u201cclaims, damages, liabilities, or rental charges\u201d directly from Appellee\u2019s insurance carrier or credit card company. When Appellee returned the car following the rental, an Enterprise employee informed her that she was responsible for a scratch on the car. Enterprise later sent Appellee a letter with an estimate for repairs and an invoice for administrative, loss-of-use, and diminishment-of-value fees, for a total of $840.42. Complaint, Exhibit A at 3 & \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\nAppellee, represented by counsel, instituted this action against Enterprise in June 2011, by filing a six-count complaint that included a claim for damages under the UTPCPL\u2019s \u201ccatchall\u201d provision. See 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(4)(xxi) (prohibiting \u201cfraudulent or deceptive conduct which creates a likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding\u201d). The UTPCPL allows any person who, as a result of a UTPCPL violation, suffers \u201cany ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal,\u201d to bring suit:\nAny person who purchases or leases goods or services primarily for personal, family or household purposes and thereby suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by any person of a method, act or practice declared unlawful by [73 P.S. \u00a7 201-3] may bring a private action, to recover actual damages or one hundred dollars ($100), whichever is greater. The court may, in its discretion, award up to three times the actual damages sustained, but not less than one hundred dollars ($100), and may provide such additional relief as it deems necessary or proper. The court may award to the plaintiff, in addition to other relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable attorney fees.\n73 P.S. \u00a7 201-9.2(a).\nAppellee\u2019s complaint alleged that Enterprise had engaged in deceptive acts and had made misrepresentations by charging her unconscionable fees bearing no reasonable relationship to the costs of repairing the alleged damage to the car. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 51, 56-58. She further averred that Enterprise had demanded payment and sought to collect directly from either her auto insurer or her credit card issuer, and alleged generally that she had suffered damages. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20, 53, 59-60. Enterprise counterclaimed for the $840.42, and Appellee admitted in her reply to the counterclaim that she had not paid any part of the disputed sum.\nEnterprise then moved for judgment on the pleadings, stating that if the court ruled in its favor, it would cease its collection efforts. The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the action. Regarding the UTPCPL claim, the court concluded that the pleadings did not establish a pecuniary loss, noting Enterprise\u2019s praecipe to discontinue its counterclaims and its stipulation to cease its collection efforts. Trial Court Opinion, 7/3/12, at 2-3. Appellee appealed to the Superior Court.\nThe Superior Court reversed as to Appellee\u2019s UTPCPL claim, concluding that Appellee had sufficiently pled an \u201cascertainable loss.\u201d Grimes v. Enterprise Leasing Co. of Phila., LLC, 66 A.3d 330, 339 (Pa.Super.2013). The court considered Enterprise\u2019s alleged threats to collect the $840.42 from Appellee\u2019s auto insurance carrier and her credit card issuer, and Appellee\u2019s hiring counsel to file suit to halt Enterprise\u2019s collection efforts, to be sufficient to satisfy the \u201cascertainable loss\u201d requirement. The court also pointed out that Enterprise had stipulated that it would cease its collection efforts only if the trial court granted its motion. In support of its decision, the Superior Court cited to a case it had decided in support of the proposition that this Court has engaged in the \u201cconsistent reminder that the UTPCPL \u2018should [be] liberally construe[d] ... in order to effect the legislative goal of consumer protection.\u2019 \u201d Grimes, supra, at 339 (quoting Fazio v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 62 A.3d 396, 405 (Pa.Super.2012)).\nThe Superior Court further supported its decision with a citation to Jarzyna v. Home Properties, L.P., 763 F.Supp.2d 742, 745 (E.D.Pa.2011). There, a landlord withheld a tenant\u2019s security deposit and took steps to collect other sums, and the tenant brought a claim against the landlord under the UTPCPL. The federal district court concluded that the tenant had alleged an \u201cascertainable loss\u201d because he had alleged that the landlord had unlawfully withheld his security deposit, and that the tenant had to retain counsel in order to obtain relief.\nThe Superior Court additionally cited Agliori v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 879 A.2d 315, 320 (Pa.Super.2005). In that case, a decedent\u2019s estate had sued under the UTPCPL asserting that an insurer had used deceptive practices to persuade the decedent to surrender three life insurance policies so he could buy a single policy from the insurer. The Superior Court concluded that the estate had suffered an \u201cascertainable loss\u201d because the death benefit from the surrendered policies would have exceeded the benefit under the new policy. The court stated that if it were to rule otherwise, \u201cthe deterrence value of the statute [would be] weakened, if not lost entirely.\u201d Id. at 322. The Superior Court here cited Agliori\u2019s reference to \u201cthe deterrence value of\u2019 the UTPCPL to justify its conclusion that Appellee had properly pled an \u201cascertainable loss.\u201d The court stated that, but for this suit, Enterprise would have \u201c[presumably ... long since collected the disputed charges.\u201d Grimes, supra at 339.\nWe granted review to consider the following question, as Enterprise phrased it in its Petition for Allowance of Appeal:\nWhether the Superior Court erred when it held that a plaintiff may satisfy the UTPCPL\u2019s \u201cascertainable loss\u201d requirement by voluntarily hiring an attorney and allegedly incurring litigation costs to challenge allegedly wrongful conduct, even where, as here, the plaintiff paid no money to the defendant as a result of that conduct.\nGrimes v. Enterprise Leasing Co. of Phila., 624 Pa. 228, 84 A.3d 1058 (2014).\nBefore this Court, Enterprise argues that merely retaining an attorney to commence suit cannot satisfy the UTPCPL\u2019s \u201cascertainable loss\u201d element. Enterprise argues that if that proposition was correct, then anyone can meet the \u201cascertainable loss\u201d requirement simply by finding a lawyer to bring a lawsuit, without actually suffering a loss of money or property. Enterprise criticizes the Superior Court\u2019s application of the notion that the UTPCPL should be liberally construed as leading to a result that is contrary to the Act\u2019s plain language. Enterprise maintains that because Appellee admits that she has never paid any of the disputed fees, she has not suffered an \u201cascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal.\u201d\nAppellee responds that her retention of counsel satisfies the \u201cascertainable loss\u201d requirement. She maintains that the availability under the UTPCPL of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees does not bar \u201cconsideration of the expenditure\u201d of such costs and fees as an \u201cascertainable loss,\u201d if the costs and fees were a direct result of the act giving rise to the lawsuit. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 45. She emphasizes that the General Assembly added the provision for costs and fees so that consumers who had been deprived of small amounts of money could afford to bring UTPCPL suits. Appellee argues that, in order to effectuate that purpose, we should construe the \u201cascertainable loss\u201d requirement liberally and conclude that her allegations suffice. She also argues that we should not permit Enterprise to deprive her of standing by agreeing to cease its collection efforts, and thereby avoid the UTPCPL\u2019s strictures. She asserts that such a ruling will weaken the enforcement of the Act\u2019s provisions.\nBecause the issue comes to us on appeal from the grant of judgment on the pleadings, we are in effect faced with a demurrer to the pleadings. See Emerich v. Phila. Ctr. for Human Dev., Inc., 554 Pa. 209, 720 A.2d 1032, 1034 n. 1 (1998). Our review of the grant of a motion for judgment on the pleadings is limited to whether the trial court committed an error of law or whether unresolved questions of material fact remained. Because the question of whether judgment on the pleadings was proper is a question of law, our scope of review is plenary. Bowman, 65 A.3d at 904. The question before us, then, is whether the factual allegations in Appellee\u2019s pleadings, together with the allegations she has admitted in Enterprise\u2019s pleadings, would be sufficient to support a verdict in Appellee\u2019s favor.\nWe conclude that they would not. Appellee never asserted in her primary pleading, or admitted in a response to Enterprise\u2019s pleadings, a loss of money or property due to Enterprise\u2019s alleged UTPCPL violations. Indeed, she admitted that she has never paid anything toward the outstanding bill, and she has not argued that the unpaid bill, standing alone, meets the \u201cascertainable loss\u201d requirement. Her assertion on appeal is that the mere retention of counsel constitutes an \u201cascertainable loss\u201d; this assertion is insufficient to withstand a motion for judgment on the pleadings because the assertion was never made in a pleading before the court below. See Pa.R.C.P. 1017(a) (limiting the pleadings in a civil action to a complaint; an answer; a reply if the answer contains either new matter, a counterclaim or a cross-claim; a counter-reply if the reply contains new matter; preliminary objections; and response to preliminary objections).\nEven if Appellee had made the relevant allegations in a pleading, we hold that the mere acquisition of counsel would not suffice to satisfy the \u201cascertainable loss\u201d requirement. Whether a relevant \u201cascertainable loss\u201d was suffered here requires us to determine and effectuate the meaning the General Assembly intended to convey in its statutory language. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a); Commonwealth v. Rushing, 627 Pa. 59, 99 A.3d 416, 423 (2014). If we conclude that the statutory language is ambiguous, we turn to the tools of statutory construction to determine the intended meaning. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c); Bricklayers of W. Pa. Combined Funds, Inc. v. Scott\u2019s Dev. Co., 625 Pa. 26, 90 A.3d 682, 690 (2014). Statutory text is ambiguous if it is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations. Warrantech Consumer Prods. Servs., Inc. v. Reliance Ins. Co. in Liquidation, 626 Pa. 218, 96 A.3d 346, 354-55 (2014). We also engage in certain presumptions when construing a statute, including the presumption that the General Assembly did not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1); Commonwealth v. Hall, 622 Pa. 396, 80 A.3d 1204, 1211 (2013).\nHere, the operative statute initially provides for damages relative to \u201cascertainable loss[es],\u201d then separately provides for awards of \u201ccosts and reasonable attorney fees.\u201d 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-9.2(a). This express authorization of attorney fees awards is \u201cin addition to other relief provided in this section,\u201d which \u201cother relief\u2019 encompasses the damages made available as compensation for ascertainable losses. The fees are derivative and consequential. Section 9.2(a)\u2019s plain language makes it readily apparent that the General Assembly deemed ascertainable losses and attorneys\u2019 fees to be distinct items for redress. Appellee\u2019s construction of the \u201cascertainable loss\u201d element as including attorney fees is unreasonable, and contradicted by the plain language of the statute. Moreover, as Enterprise has pointed out, Appellee\u2019s reading would allow a plaintiff to manufacture the \u201cascertainable loss\u201d required to bring a private UTPCPL claim simply by obtaining counsel to bring a private UTPCPL claim; we presume that such an unreasonable result was not intended by the General Assembly. Because Appellee\u2019s argument is not premised upon a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language, neither her resort to the asserted purpose for which the Act allows costs and attorneys\u2019 fees, nor the Superior Court\u2019s reliance on the \u201cdeterrence value\u201d of the UTPCPL, is persuasive. In either case, we would still be left with the untenable result that a plaintiff could incur an \u201cascertainable loss\u201d simply by hiring counsel.\nA similar infirmity attends Appellee\u2019s additional assertion that Enterprise\u2019s position will weaken enforcement of the Act. Moreover, that argument runs counter to the overall statutory scheme. The UTPCPL\u2019s private right of action is not a general-purpose enforcement provision. Rather, the Act confers on the Attorney General and district attorneys the power to bring actions in the public interest to enforce the Act. See 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-4. Only those who can meet the requirements of the UTPCPL\u2019s private cause of action may bring a personal action, and Appellee\u2019s allegations simply do not satisfy the statutory \u201cascertainable loss\u201d element.\nThe decisions in Jarzyna, supra, and Agliori, supra, also do not help Appellee\u2019s cause. In both cases, the plaintiff had alleged a specific loss of money. In Jarzyna, the plaintiff asserted that his landlord withheld his security deposit; in Agliori, the plaintiff claimed that he had been deprived of insurance benefits. As for Enterprise\u2019s stipulation, we do not dispute the general proposition that a defendant should not be permitted to evade a legal obligation by stipulating away a plaintiffs standing. But, the fact remains that it was Appellee who insufficiently pleaded an \u201cascertainable loss.\u201d Thus, her UTPCPL claim cannot survive.\nFinally, there is some force in the observations of other jurisdictions addressing similar provisions in state consumer protection statutes, that if attorneys\u2019 fees were to be considered in the calculation of \u201cascertainable loss,\u201d the explicit provision for the award of attorneys\u2019 fees would be superfluous. See e.g., Jones v. Midland Funding, LLC, 755 F.Supp.2d 393, 398 (D.Conn.2010) (applying Connecticut law and holding that expenses incurred by a plaintiff in consulting an attorney and bringing suit do not constitute \u201cascertainable loss\u201d under Connecticut consumer protection statute); C.A.R. Tow, Inc. v. Corwin, 76 Or.App. 192, 708 P.2d 644, 646 (1985) (\u201cAlthough even a very small loss can qualify as an \u2018ascertainable loss,\u2019 ... attorney fees are not the type of loss that [the unfair trade practices statute] contemplates, because the legislature provided an independent basis for the recovery of attorney fees.\u201d (citations omitted)).\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed. Jurisdiction is relinquished.\nFormer Justice McCAFFERY did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices SAYLOR, EAKIN, BAER, TODD and STEVENS join the per curiam opinion.\n. 73 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 201-1-201-9.3.\n. Because we are reviewing the grant of judgment on the pleadings, we regard as true the well-pleaded allegations of Appellee\u2019s pleadings, as she is the non-moving party, and consider against her only those factual allegations in Appellant\u2019s pleadings that Appellee has admitted. Bowman v. Sunoco, Inc., 620 Pa. 28, 65 A.3d 901, 904 (2013) (quoting Pennsylvania Dept. of Banking v. NCAS of Delaware, LLC, 596 Pa. 638, 948 A.2d 752 (2008)).\n. Although we also granted review to consider whether a private plaintiff who alleges deceptive conduct under the UTPCPL's \"catchall\" provision need not plead or prove justifiable reliance, we will not address that question because the \"ascertainable loss\u201d issue is dispositive."}
