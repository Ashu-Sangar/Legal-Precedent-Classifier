{"id": "1910400", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nLuigina B. Ervien died November 10, 1965. Her original will could not be found. Her executors presented to the Register of Wills of Montgomery County for probate, a conformed but unsigned copy of her last 'will. That copy provided that in the event testatrix\u2019s husband predeceased her, which he did, her residuary estate was to be divided equally between her husband\u2019s niece, Doris Ervien Marsh, and her husband\u2019s grandnephew, Ralph Edward Marsh, Jr., with each of whom she had maintained a close family relationship. Testatrix\u2019s only known living relative, Carolina Barbarini, her sister who resided in Italy, and whom she had not seen except for two short visits for 46 years, contested the probate of this copy and claimed testatrix\u2019s estate under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania.\nThe Register of Wills refused to probate the conformed copy of the will and the executors filed an appeal in the Orphans\u2019 Court. After a hearing de novo, the Orphans\u2019 Court reversed the decision of the Register of Wills and admitted the conformed copy to probate. . Carolina Barbarini thereupon took this appeal.\nWe have reviewed the record but deem it unnecessary to discuss the evidence or the law governing the probate of a conformed copy of an allegedly lost will. We find no abuse of discretion or error of law.\nDecree affirmed, each party to pay own costs.\nMr. Justice Cohen took no part in the consideration or decision of this case."}
