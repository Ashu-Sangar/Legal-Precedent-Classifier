{"id": "474221", "contents": "OPINION\nMONTEMURO, Justice.\nAppellant, Jonathon Stewart, appeals from an order and memorandum opinion of the Superior Court affirming a judgement of the Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County following a verdict in favor of appellee, Martin Motts, in this action for personal injuries, 434 Pa.Super. 709, 641 A.2d 1238.\nThe sole issue presented before us is whether there exists a higher standard of \u201cextraordinary care\u201d for the use of dangerous instrumentalities over and above the standard of \u201creasonable care\u201d such that the trial court erred for failing to give an instruction to the jury that the Appellee should have used a \u201chigh degree of care\u201d in handling gasoline. Because we believe that there is but one standard of care, the standard of \u201creasonable care\u201d, we affirm.\nThe pertinent facts of this case are simple and were ably stated by the trial court:\nOn July 15, 1987, Plaintiff, Jonathon Stewart, stopped at Defendant, Martin Motts\u2019 auto repair shop and offered assistance to the Defendant in repairing an automobile fuel tank. In an effort to start and move the car with the gasoline tank unattached, the Plaintiff suggested and then proceeded to pour gasoline into the carburetor. The Defendant was to turn the ignition key at a given moment. While the exact sequence of events was contested, the tragic result was that the car backfired, caused an explosion and resulted in Plaintiff suffering severe burns to his upper body. On October 8, 1992, following a two day trial, a jury returned a verdict for the defendant thus denying the Plaintiffs claim for damages.\nStewart v. Motts, No. 52 Civil of 1988, slip op. at 1 (Court of Common Pleas of Monroe County, Dec. 18, 1992).\nThe only issue raised before this Court is the refusal of the trial court to read Stewart\u2019s requested point for charge No. 4. This point for charge reads:\nWe are instructing you that gasoline due to its inflammability, is a very dangerous substance if not properly handled. Therefore, it is incumbent on Mr. Stewart to use care in pouring the gasoline into the motor vehicle. It is also the duty of Mr. Motts to use care in starting the machine to see that the vehicle started without any risk of harm to anyone, particularly Mr. Stewart. The backfiring of engines without the air filter on them does occur. Both Motts, and Stewart, realized, or should have realized the dangerous nature of this substance, and knew, or should have known that the engine may backfire, and/or that the gas may ignite, and burn. With an appreciation of such danger, and under conditions where its existence reasonably should have been known, there follows a high degree of care which circumscribes the conduct of everyone about the danger, and whether the parties, Motts, t/a Motts Radiator, and Stewart, acted as reasonable men under the circumstances is for you the jury to decide. See Konchar v. Cebular, 333 Pa. 499, 3 A.2d 913 (1939).\nThe trial court denied this point of charge finding that it was \u201ccumulative with respect to the standard charge given by the Court....\u201d Stewart, slip op. at 3. In this appeal, Stewart argues that the trial court erred in failing to read point of charge No. 4 to the jury because Pennsylvania law applies an \u201cextraordinary\u201d or \u201cheightened duty of care\u201d to those employing a dangerous agency.\nWe begin our discussion by reaffirming the principle that there is but one standard of care to be applied to negligence actions involving dangerous instrumentalities in this Commonwealth. This standard of care is \u201creasonable care\u201d as well stated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts:\nThe care required is always reasonable care. The standard never varies, but the care which it is reasonable to require of the actor varies with the danger involved in his act and is proportionate to it. The greater the danger, the greater the care which must be exercised....\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 298 comment b (1965).\nThis comment goes on to say that where the reasonable character of an actor\u2019s conduct is in question \u201cits utility is to be weighed against the magnitude of the risk which it involves.\u201d Id. Thus, if an act involves risk of death or bodily injury, \u201cthe highest attention and caution are required.... \u201d Therefore, the comment concludes, \u201cthose who deal with firearms, explosives, poisonous drugs or high tension electricity are required to exercise the closest attention and the most careful precautions ...\u201d Id.\nProperly read, our cases involving dangerous agencies reaffirm these well accepted principles found in the Restatement. In Konchar v. Cebular, 333 Pa. 499, 3 A.2d 913 (1939), a case relied upon heavily by appellant in the case at bar, the plaintiff drove into a gas station and ordered a gallon of gasoline. The defendant began pumping gas into the motorcycle, but when three quarters of a gallon was placed in the tank, the gasoline overflowed and ran into the hot cylinders of the engine. The plaintiff, sitting on the motorcycle, was burned when the gasoline exploded. In the subsequent lawsuit for personal injuries, the jury returned a verdict to the defendant. The plaintiff claimed that the trial court erred in sending the question of his contributory negligence to the jury. In deciding the case, this Court noted that gasoline was a dangerous substance requiring a \u201chigh duty of care.\u201d Konchar, 333 Pa. at 501, 3 A.2d at 914. We affirmed, holding that, \u201c[i]t was for the jury to decide whether, under all of the circumstances, [the plaintiff] had acted as a reasonably prudent man.\u201d Id. Thus, we recognized that the question of the plaintiffs contributory negligence was to be determined using the reasonable care standard in light of the particular circumstances of the case. One such circumstance, we acknowledged, was that gasoline, a dangerous substance, was involved requiring that the reasonably prudent person exercise a higher degree of care under these circumstances. Taken in context, our statement that the plaintiff was under a \u201chigh duty of care\u201d did nothing more than reaffirm the general principle that the care employed by a reasonable man must be proportionate to the danger of the activity.\nSimilarly, in Fredericks v. Atlantic Refining Co., 282 Pa. 8, 127 A. 615 (1925), the plaintiff pulled into the station and requested gasoline. He was handed the hose and inserted it in the opening. When the valve failed to stop the flow, he called for the attendant to shut off the pump. Instead, the attendant yanked the hose out of the plaintiffs hands causing gasoline to be thrown all over. The gasoline caught fire, severely burning the plaintiff. We affirmed the trial court finding that the plaintiff had sustained his claim of negligence. In affirming, our Court stated the general principle that \u201c[njegligence is absence or want of care under the circumstances.\u201d Fredericks, 282 Pa. at 13, 127 A. at 616. We found that \u201ca higher degree of care is required in dealing with a dangerous agency than in the ordinary affairs of life or business which involve little or no risk.\u201d Id. Ultimately we held that \u201c[n]o absolute standard can be fixed by law, but every reasonable precaution suggested by experience and the known danger ought to be taken.\u201d Id. We closely followed the reasoning of Fredericks in MacDougall v. Pennsylvania Power & Light, 311 Pa. 387, 166 A. 589 (1933) (electricity as a dangerous agency); Pryor v. Chambersburg Oil & Gas Co., 376 Pa. 521, 103 A.2d 425 (1954) (gasoline as a dangerous agency). We do not believe that these cases created a heightened or extraordinary standard of care above and beyond the standard of reasonable care for handling dangerous agencies. When we referred to a \u201chigher degree of care\u201d in these cases, we were not creating a second tier of \u201cextraordinary care\u201d over and above ordinary or reasonable care. Instead, we were simply recognizing the general principle that under the reasonable care standard, the level of care must be proportionate to the danger involved. Our use of the language \u201chigher degree of care\u201d merely stated the common sense conclusion that the use of a dangerous agency would require the reasonably prudent person to exercise more care. In fact these cases rejected any formalistic higher standard of care in holding that \u201cno absolute standard of care [could] be fixed by law.\u201d\nAdmittedly, this notion of a heightened level of \u201cextraordinary care\u201d for the handling of dangerous agencies has crept into our jurisprudence. In Kuhns v. Brugger, 390 Pa. 331, 135 A.2d 395 (1957), this Court considered the proper standard of care for negligence involving a handgun. The defendant in this case was a grandfather who had left a loaded handgun in an unlocked dresser drawer. While alone in the house, his grandchild found the gun and inadvertently shot another child. We affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that the grandfather was negligent for permitting a highly dangerous instrumentality to be in the place where a child could come into contact with it. In so affirming, we found that the possession of a loaded handgun placed upon the defendant the duty of, \u201cexercising not simply ordinary, but extraordinary care so that no harm might be visited upon others.\u201d Kuhns, 390 Pa. at 344, 135 A.2d at 403. This language in Kuhns on its face unfortunately suggests that this Commonwealth recognizes a separate standard of care, \u201cextraordinary care\u201d, for dangerous instrumentalities above and beyond \u201cordinary care.\u201d We reject this suggestion. We note that the Kuhns Court adopted the above-quoted language without citation to or consideration of this Court\u2019s previous cases involving dangerous agencies or the Restatement (Second) of Torts. Since the Kuhns Court did not specifically overrule any of these previous cases, we choose to interpret Kuhns consistent with Fredericks, Ronchar, MacDougall, and Pryor. We note that the Kuhns Court explained:\nWe are not called upon to determine whether the possession of other instrumentalities or objects____would impose the same degree of care under similar circumstances; we are simply to determine the degree of care imposed upon the possessor of a loaded pistol, a weapon possessing lethal qualities, under the circumstances.\nKuhns, 390 Pa. at 344, 135 A.2d at 403.\nThis language strongly suggests that the Kuhns Court did not create a standard of \u201cextraordinary care\u201d for all dangerous instrumentalities as advocated by the appellant. Instead, we believe that the Kuhns Court considered the danger of an unattended hand gun under the circumstances of this case and fashioned a standard of care proportionate to that danger. This was the conclusion of Judge Spaeth in the Opinion in Support of Affirmance in Everette v. City of New Kensington, 262 Pa.Super. 28, 396 A.2d 467 (1978). Judge Spaeth considered our opinion in Kuhns and explicitly rejected the argument that it created a standard of \u201cextraordinary care\u201d over and above the standard of reasonable care. In Everette, the Dissent argued that Kuhns imposed a higher standard of \u201cextraordinary care\u201d in situations in which a civilian possesses a firearm. Everette, 262 Pa.Super. at 41, 396 A.2d at 474 (Price J., dissenting). Judge Spaeth rejected this argument, stating:\nIt depends upon, and echoes, the mistaken supposition that there is a \u2018higher standard\u2019 of \u2018extraordinary care\u2019, in contrast to a lesser standard of \u2018reasonable care.\u2019 As Kuhns and the cases it cites hold, there is no such hierarchy of standards; to repeat: for a person who possesses a loaded firearm, \u2018extraordinary care\u2019 is \u2018reasonable care.\u2019\nId. at 33, 396 A.2d at 469-70.\nWe agree with Judge Spaeth\u2019s well-reasoned interpretation of Kuhns.\nIn summation, this Commonwealth recognizes only one standard of care in negligence actions involving dangerous instrumentalities \u2014 the standard of reasonable care under the circumstances. It is well established by our case law that the reasonable man must exercise care in proportion to the danger involved in his act. See MacDougall, 311 Pa. at 396, 166 A. at 592 (\u201cVigilance must always be commensurate with danger. A high degree of danger always calls for a high degree of care.\u201d); Lineaweaver v. John Wanamaker Philadelphia, 299 Pa. 45, 49, 149 A. 91, 92 (1930) (\u201cThe care required increases with the danger.\u201d). Thus, when a reasonable man is presented with circumstances involving the use of dangerous instrumentalities, he must necessarily exercise a \u201chigher\u201d degree of care proportionate to the danger. Our case law has long recognized this common sense proposition that a reasonable man under the circumstances will exert a \u201chigher\u201d degree of care when handling dangerous agencies. See Pryor, 376 Pa. at 526, 103 A.2d at 427 (a \u201chigher degree of care\u201d imposed on persons dealing with gasoline); Konchar, 333 Pa. at 501, 3 A.2d at 914 (a \u201chigh duty of care\u201d required for the handling of gasoline); MacDougall, 311 Pa. at 393, 166 A. at 591 (a \u201chigher degree of care and vigilance\u201d required for the handling of electricity); and Fredericks, 282 Pa. at 13, 127 A. at 616 (a \u201chigher degree of care\u201d required for the handling of gasoline).\nWith these principles in mind we must next examine the jury instructions in this case. In examining these instructions, our scope of review is to determine whether the trial court committed clear abuse of discretion or error of law controlling the outcome of the case. Williams v. Philadelphia Transportation Company, 415 Pa. 370, 374, 203 A.2d 665, 668 (1964). Error in a charge is sufficient ground for a new trial, if the charge as a whole is inadequate or not clear or has a tendency to mislead or confuse rather than clarify a material issue. Glider v. Com. Dept. of Hwys., 435 Pa. 140, 151-52, 255 A.2d 542, 547 (1969). A charge will be found adequate unless \u201cthe issues are not made clear to the jury or the jury was palpably misled by what the trial judge said or unless there is an omission in the charge which amounts .to fundamental error.\u201d Voitasefski v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., 363 Pa. 220, 226, 69 A.2d 370, 373 (1949); A reviewing court will not grant a new trial on the ground of inadequacy of the charge unless there is a prejudicial omission of something basic or fundamental. Sweeny v. Bonafiglia, 403 Pa. 217, 221, 169 A.2d 292, 293 (1961); Giorgianni v. DiSanzo, 392 Pa. 350, 356, 140 A.2d 802, 805 (1958). In reviewing a trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, we must not take the challenged words or passage out of context of the whole of the charge, but must look to the charge in its entirety. McCay v. Philadelphia Electric Company, 447 Pa. 490, 499, 291 A.2d 759, 763 (1972).\nReviewing the charge as a whole, we cannot conclude that it was inadequate. The trial judge explained to the jury that negligence is \u201cthe absence of ordinary care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise in the circumstances here presented.\u201d Transcript of Testimony 10/7/92 at 158. The trial judge further explained:\nIt is for you to determine how a reasonably prudent person would act in those circumstances. Ordinary care is the care a reasonably prudent person would use under the circumstances presented in this case. It is the duty of every person to use ordinary care not only for his own safety and the protection of his property, but also to avoid serious injury to others. What constitutes ordinary care varies according to the particular circumstances and conditions existing then and there. The amount of care required by law must be in keeping with the degree of danger involved.\nId. at 158-59.\nThe trial judge essentially repeated these instructions in affirming appellee\u2019s point of charge number 8. This point of charge explained that \u201c[wjhat is required of a reasonably prudent man is that he exercise care for his safety according to the circumstances.\u201d Id. at 173. This point of charge further explained that \u201c[w]hen he knows that he is undertaking any activity of danger, his care must be commensurate with that danger.\u201d Id.\nWe find that this charge, when read as a whole, adequately instructed the jury. The charge informed the jury that the proper standard of care was \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cordinary\u201d care under the circumstances in accordance with the law of this Commonwealth. The charge properly instructed the jury that the level of care required changed with the circumstances. The charge also informed the jury that the level of care required increased proportionately with the level of danger in the activity. We find nothing in this charge that is confusing, misleading, or unclear. From these instructions, the jury had the tools to examine the circumstances of the case and determine that the defendant was required to exercise a \u201chigher degree of care\u201d in using the dangerous agency of gasoline.\nNor do we believe that the failure of the trial judge to include the plaintiffs requested jury point for charge No. 4 was an omission constituting \u201cfundamental error.\u201d Plaintiffs requested point for charge stated that the defendant was required to use a \u201chigh degree of care\u201d in employing the dangerous agency of gasoline. As discussed supra, there is no standard of heightened or \u201cextraordinary care\u201d in this Commonwealth that would entitle the plaintiff to this instruction as a matter of law. We do not believe that the phrase \u201chigh degree of care\u201d found frequently in our case law has any talismanic properties requiring that it always be used in instructing the jury on the standard of care in cases involving dangerous agencies or instrumentalities. We believe it more important that the jury be instructed on the proper standard of care, reasonable or ordinary care under the circumstances, and the requirement that reasonable care is care proportionate to the danger of the activity. This was clearly done in the instant case.\nAppellant argues that the language in his point for charge was nearly identical to Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Civil Jury Instruction 3.16 which sets forth the standard of care to be employed on inherently dangerous instrumentalities. PSSCJI 3.16 provides that anyone using a dangerous instrumentality is \u201crequired by law to use the highest degree of care practicable.\u201d Assuming the applicability of this instruction to the case at bar, we find nothing in it inconsistent with our holding today. The \u201chighest degree of care practicable\u201d is simply another way of phrasing reasonable or ordinary care under the circumstances. We note that this standard jury instruction and point of charge No. 4 are completely consistent with our law. In fact, the use of such an instruction may very well have made the issue clearer to the jury. However, our standard of review is not to determine whether the jury had the best or clearest instructions, but whether they had adequate instructions. We find the jury instructions given in this case to be adequate. The trial judge rejected the plaintiffs point for charge No. 4 as \u201ccumulative\u201d of other jury instructions. We find no abuse of discretion or error of law on the part of the trial court in making this determination.\nFor the reasons set forth above, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.\nPAPADAKOS, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nZAPPALA, J., concurs in the result.\nMONTEMURO, J., is sitting by designation.\n. We also note that language suggesting a standard of \"extraordinary care\" can be found in Matulevich v. Matulevich, 345 Pa.Super. 507, 498 A.2d 939 (1985). In Matulevich, the Superior Court held, \"[w]e agree with the lower court that the handling of firearms ... is an activity \u25a0 requiring extraordinary care.\" Id. at 511, 498 A.2d at 941. However, the issue before the court in Matulevich was whether the trial court erred in not instructing the jury that a possessor of a gun was strictly liable for any injury he caused. The Superior Court rejected the argument that the law of strict liability applied and affirmed the trial court's instruction that the standard was one of \u201cextraordinary care.\" Thus, the issue of whether the proper standard was reasonable care or extraordinary care was not argued before the court nor questioned by any of the parties. Therefore, this case properly stands for the proposition that accidents involving firearms are to be governed not by strict liability principles, but by negligence principles. This case did not establish \"extraordinary care\u201d as the proper standard. Rather, it merely accepted arguendo the standard applied by the trial court and unquestioned by the parties as the correct standard.\n. PSSCJI 3.16 states in full:\nAnyone who supplies or uses an inherently dangerous instrumentality, such as the high voltage current (acids, corrosives, explosives) provided (supplied) (used) by the defendant in this case is required by law to use the highest degree of care practicable to avoid injury to everyone who may be lawfully in the area of such activity."}
