{"id": "1154731", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nFrom the stipulation of facts, made pursuant to Rule 56, we understand that an action for slander was brought by appellant against the defendants. At the trial, when plaintiff rested, defendants moved that a compulsory nonsuit be entered. The learned trial judge, in some doubt, reserved decision. Defendants then began putting in their case and, at the opening of court on the next day, the judge stated that he had concluded that defendants\u2019 motion must be granted. After the motion to take off the nonsuit was dismissed, plaintiff took this appeal.\nAppellant contends that, after defendants began offering testimony, the judge could not, in accord with his reservation, grant defendants\u2019 motion; that \u201cdefendants [had] waived their right to a nonsuit by presenting testimony in their defense.\u201d\nIn his opinion, filed pursuant to Rule 58, the learned trial judge stated that \u201cthe nonsuit was entered on the theory that the action was one for slander and that such an action could not be sustained against two or more joint defendants.\u201d He also said: \u201cUpon the trial of the case the plaintiff called numerous witnesses who testified to various statements made by defendants individually and at different times, which, if untrue, would be slanderous and actionable per se.\u201d We have no other information concerning the cause of action declared on. It is elementary that a number of different torts committed by various persons at different times cannot be redressed in a single action merely because the plaintiff may have been injured by each wrong. Even if the action had been tried to a verdict for plaintiff, it would have been the duty of the court to enter judgment for the defendants n. o. v. It is, therefore, unnecessary to consider appellant\u2019s analysis of the Act of March 11, 1875, P. L. 6, providing for the entry of compulsory nonsuits, for, in any case, he was not harmed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
