{"id": "896107", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal is from the judgment entered by the court below against the defendant for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. For reasons given by the court we think there was no error in \u201cholding that the facts set forth in the defendants\u2019 affidavit of defense \u201d do not constitute a defense to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action; and hence there was no' error in making the rule for judgment absolute.\nThe judgment is affirmed for reasons given in the opinion of .the court below."}
