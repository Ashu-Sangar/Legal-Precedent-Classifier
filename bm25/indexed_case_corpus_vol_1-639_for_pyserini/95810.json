{"id": "95810", "contents": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nNEWMAN, Justice.\nGeraldine and Gordon Trowbridge (Appellants), have appealed from the order of the Superior Court that affirmed the Order of Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County (trial court), which dismissed Appellant\u2019s Pennsylvania Human Relations Act complaint. For the reasons that follow} we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand this matter to the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nThe Scranton Artificial Limb Company (Appellee) employed Appellant, in a clerical capacity, from June 3, 1975 through February 6, 1989. Throughout her employment, Appellant suffered from muscular dystrophy, a progressive disease characterized by the wasting of one\u2019s muscles, and she was confined to a wheelchair. On February 6,1989, Herbert Niehuus, the owner of Appellee Company, told Appellant that she would be laid off from her job with Appellee in two weeks. She resigned the same day.\nOn September 8, 1989, Appellant applied for Social Security Administration (SSA) disability insurance benefits. In her application for benefits, Appellant stated, under penalty of perjury, that she \u201cbecame unable to work because of [her] disabling condition [muscular dystrophy] on February 6, 1988.\u201d In order to be entitled to disability insurance benefit payments, an applicant must be suffering from a \u201cdisability\u201d that is defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A) as the \u201cinability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d (Emphasis added). Appellant\u2019s application for SSA disability benefits was approved, and she has received those benefits continuously since 1989.\nOn July 9, 1990 (seventeen months after the termination of her job), Appellant filed the lawsuit before this Court today. In it, she claimed that the termination of her employment with Appellee was illegal and discriminatory, in violation of the provisions of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (PHRA). Section 955(a) of the PHRA provides that it shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice for any employer to discharge from employment any individual because of a \u201cnon-job related handicap or disability.\u201d A non-job related handicap or disability means a handicap or disability \u201cwhich does not substantially interfere with the ability to perforin the essential functions\u201d of the individual\u2019s employment. 43 P.S. \u00a7 954(p) (emphasis added).\nAppellee moved for summary judgment on Appellant\u2019s PHRA claim. The trial court granted the motion, and dismissed Appellant\u2019s complaint, on January 27, 1997. The trial court, applying the doctrine of judicial estoppel, found that Appellant\u2019s representations to the SSA, that she was unable to work because of her disability, were irreconcilable with a PHRA claim, which alleged that her disability did not substantially interfere with her ability to perform her job.\nOn appeal, the Superior Court affirmed the trial court in an unpublished opinion. The Superior Court found that Appellant successfully claimed under the SSA statute that she was unable to perform any substantial gainful activity as of February 6, 1989. They then examined her claim under the PHRA, claiming that she suffered from a disability that did not substantially interfere with her ability to perform the essential functions of her job, and they found that the latter assertion directly contradicted the former. The court applied the doctrine of judicial estoppel, and held that to permit Appellant to contradict a statement made under penalty of perjury would flaunt a fundamental assumption made in the judicial system; that assertions made under oath are true. Accordingly, the court found that Appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge, and the trial court appropriately entered a summary judgment.\nWe granted allocatur to consider the question of whether the doctrine of judicial estoppel applies to bar Appellant\u2019s claim pursuant to the PHRA when she had previously applied for and received Social Security disability insurance benefits based on her sworn statement that she was unable to work because of her muscular dystrophy.\nDISCUSSION\nBecause this is an appeal from the grant of a motion for summary judgment, our standard of review is well settled. Summary judgment may be granted only in the clearest of cases where the record shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and also demonstrates that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. P.J.S. v. Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission, 555 Pa. 149, 723 A.2d 174, 176 (1999).\nWe turn now to the issue before us and to the doctrine of judicial estoppel. As a general rule, a party to an action is estopped from assuming a position inconsistent with his or her assertion in a previous action, if his or her contention was successfully maintained. Associated Hospital Service of Philadelphia v. Pustilnik, 497 Pa. 221, 439 A.2d 1149, 1151 (1981). \u201cFederal courts have long applied this principle of estoppel where litigants \u2018play fast and loose\u2019 with the courts by switching legal positions to suit their own ends.\u201d Ligon v. Middletown, Area School District, 136 Pa.Cmwlth. 566, 584 A.2d 376, 380 (1990). See for example: Government of the Virgin Islands v. Paniagua, 922 F.2d 178 (3rd Cir.1990); Murray v. Silberstein, 882 F.2d 61 (3rd Cir.1989). The purpose of this doctrine is to uphold the integrity of the courts by \u201cpreventing parties from abusing the judicial process by changing positions as the moment requires.\u201d Gross v. City of Pittsburgh, 686 A.2d 864, 867 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996). In Murray v. Silberstein, supra,, for example, the court judicially estopped the plaintiff from seeking monetary damages after arguing earlier that a court should enter a preliminary injunction because damages were unavailable to him. Likewise, in Thompson v. Anderson, 429 Pa.Super. 532, 632 A.2d 1349 (1993), the plaintiff was estopped from claiming that defendant\u2019s conduct was negligent after successfully maintaining in an earlier proceeding that the same conduct was intentional. (Plaintiff claimed she was injured after she slipped off the hood of a car driven by defendant.) In Gross v. City of Pittsburgh, supra, the court estopped the city of Pittsburgh from advancing a contrary position in a state eminent domain proceeding from that offered in a federal trial.\nEarlier this year, but after the instant matter was argued, the United States Supreme Court decided the case of Cleveland v. Policy Management Systems Corp., 526 U.S. 795, 119 S.Ct. 1597, 143 L.Ed.2d 966 (1999). Cleveland involved the analogous, but not identical, issue concerning whether an individual\u2019s application for and receipt of social security disability benefits barred a subsequent lawsuit under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990(ADA). In Cleveland, the Supreme Court held that the pursuit, and receipt, of social security benefits did not automatically estop the recipient from pursuing an ADA claim. The Court based its decision, in large part, on the fact that the ADA defines a \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d to include a disabled person who can perform the essential functions of his or her job with a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). It was also noted by the Court that \u201cwhen the SSA determines whether an individual is disabled for SSDI [social security disability insurance] purposes, it does not take the possibility of \u2018reasonable accommodation\u2019 into account, nor need an applicant refer to the possibility of reasonable accommodation when she applies for SSDI.\u201d Cleveland, 119 S.Ct. at 1602. The Court then specifically found that \u201can ADA suit claiming that the plaintiff can perform her job with reasonable accommodation may well prove consistent with an SSDI claim that the plaintiff could not perform her own job (or other jobs) without it.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). The Court nevertheless stated that an ADA plaintiff could not simply ignore the apparent contradiction that arises out of the earlier SSA total disability claim, but must proffer a sufficient explanation to defeat a motion for summary judgment.\nIn the instant matter, Appellant successfully applied for social security disability insurance benefits. She then filed her lawsuit pursuant to the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. However, the PHRA does not apply to prevent the discharge of an employee who does have a handicap that substantially interferes with that employee\u2019s ability to perform the essential functions of his or her employment. See Buckno v. Penn Linen & Uniform Service, Inc. 428 Pa.Super. 563, 631 A.2d 674, 676 (1993). Rather, the PHRA provides protection to one dismissed from employment because of a \u201cnon-job related handicap,\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 955, which means a handicap or disability \u201cwhich does not substantially interfere with the ability to perform the essential functions\u201d of the individual\u2019s employment. 43 P.S. \u00a7 954(p). Thus, Appellant would have to establish that, on February 6, 1989, her handicap did not \u201csubstantially interfere\u201d with her ability to perform the essential functions of her job. Nevertheless, Appellant had previously claimed in her application for SSI benefits that she was, in fact, unable to work. This prior allegation was made under oath and resulted in the payment of total disability benefits, and this is difficult to reconcile with her claims in the instant lawsuit. In Cleveland, however, the Supreme Court permitted the Appellant to attempt to explain the apparent inconsistency of her positions by noting that an ADA claim in which one could perform his or her job with reasonable accommodation may be consistent with a prior SSA disability claim.\nOur PHRA statute does not specifically contain in the definition of \u201cnon-job related disability or handicap\u201d the possibility of reasonable accommodations. However, the regulations relating to the Act do provide at 16 Pa.Code \u00a7 44.14(a) that an \u201cemployer shall make reasonable accommodations by modifying a job, including, but not limited to, modification of duties, scheduling, amount or nature of training, assistance provided, and the like, provided that the modification does not impose an undue hardship.\u201d When interpreting the Act, courts of this Commonwealth have noted that an employer is required to make a reasonable attempt to accommodate a handicapped or disabled employee. See Commonwealth, Department of Transportation v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission, 510 Pa. 401, 508 A.2d 1187 (1986)(in the absence of a finding that shifting other workers from their regular assignments whenever complainant needed assistance with heavy lifting would be a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d or an \u201cundue hardship,\u201d this Court could not properly review whether complainant\u2019s disability was job-related); Jenks v. Avco Corporation, 340 Pa.Super. 542, 490 A.2d 912 (1985).\nThe Act is to be liberally construed to accomplish its purposes. 43 P.S. \u00a7 962(a). It is the public policy of the Commonwealth to \u201cfoster the employment of all individuals in accordance with their fullest capacities regardless of their ... handicap or disability ... \u201d43 P.S. \u00a7 952(b), Consequently, we hold today that Appellant\u2019s claims made in her application for social security disability insurance benefits do not automatically estop her from maintaining a claim under the PHRA. However, as the Supreme Court required in Cleveland, to defeat the motion for summary judgment, Appellant must sufficiently explain how the claims she made in her social security disability insurance benefits proceedings are consistent with her claims under the PHRA in which she stated that she suffers from a non-job related handicap or disability.\nAccordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court, and we remand the Appellants\u2019 cause of action under the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act to the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nJustice CAPPY files a concurring opinion in which Justice ZAPPALA joins.\nChief Justice FLAHERTY files a dissenting opinion in which Justice CASTILLE joins.\n. For the sake of clarity, we will refer to Geraldine Trowbridge as \"Appellant\u201d throughout this opinion.\n. The date o\u00ed' February 6, 1988 was an error. Appellant later stated in her deposition that the correct date was February 6, 1989.\n. 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 951-963."}
