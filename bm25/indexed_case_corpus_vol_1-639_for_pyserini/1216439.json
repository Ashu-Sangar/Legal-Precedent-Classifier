{"id": "1216439", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nPlaintiff appeals from judgment n. o. v. in an action for damages resulting from collision of two automobiles, during daytime, at a right angle highway intersection in Crawford County. The roads had gravel surfaces and are described by the surveyor who made the map in evidence as approximately 28 feet wide from ditch to ditch; the intersection therefore was a square not larger than 28 by 28 feet. The opinion of the learned court adequately states the reasons requiring the judgment; we need only indicate why it must be affirmed. Plaintiff (succeeded on the record by his administratrix) occupied the front seat of his car driven by his son but on his business, as it, travelling northward, approached the cross-road on ivhich defendant was travelling westward. The son testified that at forty feet from the intersection he had a view to his right, the direction from which defendant came, of \u201c. . . 150 feet or a little better\u201d and that when \u201cmaybe twenty-five or thirty feet\u201d from the southern line, he looked to the right and entered the intersection going \u201cbetween twenty and twenty-five miles an hour\u201d and, as he did so, saw defendant\u2019s car \u201c. . . about seventy-five feet or a hundred\u201d feet away approaching \u201c... . round forty or forty-five miles an hour\u201d which defendant increased to \u201cfifty-five to sixty\u201d miles. The cars collided before the rear of plaintiff\u2019s car passed the \u201ccenter of the road\u201d, that is, before it crossed half the road. Plaintiff\u2019s son increased his speed \u201cby stepping on the gas when I came into the intersection and noticed the car was coming.\u201d It was for the court to say that such driving was not that of a prudent man: cf. Brayman v. DeWolf, 97 Pa. Superior Ct. 225; Stevens v. Allcutt, 320 Pa. 585, 184 A. 85. The son\u2019s contributory negligence bars recovery by the father: Bell v. Jacobs, 261 Pa. 204, 104 A. 587; Spegele v. Blumfield, 120 Pa. Superior Ct. 231, 182 A. 149; 2 Restatement, Torts, section 485.\nJudgment affirmed."}
