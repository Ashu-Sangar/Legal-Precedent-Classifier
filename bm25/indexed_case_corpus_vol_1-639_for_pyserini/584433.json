{"id": "584433", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nThis appeal arises from a final decree in equity which enjoined Upper Salford Township (the township) from further discharging surface water upon appellee Peter Schiff\u2019s property.\nOn February 9, 1970, Schiff purchased a home on Salford Station Road within the township. For a period of thirty years preceding the purchase, a drainage pipe, located under Salford Station Road, had drained water onto the Schiff property. In July of 1970 the township resurfaced Salford Station Road and also widened, deepened and sloped the ditch bank in which the drainage pipe was located. This work, as testified to by Schiff, substantially increased the amount of water flowing through the drainage pipe which emptied onto Schiff\u2019s land. As a result of this increased flow, Schiff\u2019s property became swampy, which caused erosion of Schiff\u2019s topsoil and damage to his trees and shrubbery. Schiff brought an action in equity to enjoin the water flow and also requested damages. The chancellor granted a permanent injunction, prohibiting the township from discharging water onto Schiff\u2019s property, but denied damages. The township then filed this appeal.\nIn this appeal, neither party disputes the fact that the township has acquired by prescription an easement to drain surface water onto Schiff\u2019s property. This finding of a prescriptive easement is supported by the chancellor\u2019s findings of fact that the township had been draining surface water onto Schiff\u2019s property for some thirty years prior to Schiff\u2019s purchase of the property, and, therefore, the prescriptive right was enforceable against Schiff. See Spring City Foundry Co. v. Carey, 434 Pa. 193, 252 A.2d 666 (1969).\nHaving found that the township had acquired a prescriptive right to drain surface water upon Schiff\u2019s property, we must now determine whether the township\u2019s increased use of that right was proper. The chancellor held that the increased use was not allowable under the township\u2019s prescriptive easement, following the principle that where the owner of a prescriptive easement undoubtedly has the right to continue the use, he may not unreasonably increase that use beyond the original use he acquired by prescription. Bodman v. Bodman, 456 Pa. 412, 321 A.2d 910 (1974), Shaffer v. Baylor\u2019s Lake Assn., Inc., 392 Pa. 493, 141 A.2d 583 (1958), Jones v. Crow, 32 Pa. 398 (1859), and L. D. Gildersleeve v. Boro. of North East Pa., 52 Erie 89 (1967).\nThe township argues that the . evidence was insufficient to support the chancellor\u2019s finding that the work done by the township increased the surface water flowing onto Schiff\u2019s land. An examination of the record supports the chancellor\u2019s finding. As we have said many times, findings of fact of a chancellor, approved by a court en banc, have the weight of a jury verdict and will not be disturbed on appeal if there is adequate evidence in the record to sustain these findings. See Rubin v. Lustro Tile Prod. Corp., 411 Pa. 549, 192 A.2d 731 (1963).\nSince the chancellor correctly reasoned that the increased use by the township was unreasonable and not permissible under its prescriptive right, and we have in the past upheld injunctions against a municipality when it unreasonably increases drainage of surface water onto a landowner\u2019s property, we find no error in the court\u2019s final decree. See St. Andrew\u2019s Ev. L. Ch. v. L. Providence Twp., 414 Pa. 40, 198 A.2d 860 (1964).\nDecree affirmed. Costs to be borne by appellant.\nSchiff does not appeal from the chancellor\u2019s denial of money damages."}
