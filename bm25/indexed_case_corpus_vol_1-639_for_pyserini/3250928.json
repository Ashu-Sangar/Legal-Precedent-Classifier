{"id": "3250928", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice BAER.\nWe granted review in these two cases to consider the interaction between a statute limiting the period of time during which a trial court may modify or rescind an order and the long-standing, inherent power of courts to correct patent errors in orders. See Commonwealth v. Cole, 437 Pa. 288, 263 A.2d 339 (1970). The two cases under review herein demonstrate a conflict in the application of authorities when trial courts attempt to exercise their inherent power to correct orders by vacating illegal sentences despite the expiration of the modification period provided by 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5505. Because in both of these cases the errors in question were patent, we determine that the trial courts had jurisdiction to correct the sentences. Accordingly, we reverse the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Holmes, 837 A.2d 501 (Pa.Super.2003), which reversed the trial court\u2019s order vacating its sentence, and affirm the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Whitfield, 3194 EDA 2002 (Pa.Super.2003), affirming the trial court\u2019s order vacating its sentence.\nWe first consider the facts relating to appellant Christopher Homes, 22 EAP 2004, as gleaned from the record developed in the trial court at CP# 9603-1287 2/2. On May 17, 1996, Holmes pleaded guilty to criminal conspiracy and a violation of the Controlled Substances Act. He was sentenced to time served to twenty-three months of incarceration, with immediate parole, followed by two years of reporting probation for the controlled substance offense and no additional sentence for the conspiracy offense. On September 16, 1997, his probation, but not his parole, was revoked and he was sentenced to eleven and one-half to twenty-three months of incarceration for a probation violation.,\nThe record reveals that at some point prior to October 1998 Holmes again was released on parole and eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced on charges unrelated to the crimes leading to the May 17, 1996 guilty plea. As a result of these new convictions, the trial court, on May 21, 2001, revoked Holmes\u2019s parole from the September 16, 1997 sentence of incarceration imposed for the violation of the probationary sentence imposed on May 17, 1996, concluding that Holmes had violated his parole \u201cin re sentence of 9-16-97.\u201d Rather than recommitting Holmes to serve the remainder of the sentence imposed on September 16, 1997, as would be proper for a parole violation, see, supra, at 59 n. 5, the court sentenced Holmes as if he had violated probation, imposing a new sentence of three to six years of incarceration to run concurrently with any other current sentence for unrelated crimes. Notwithstanding its impropriety, Holmes did not appeal this sentence. On April 9, 2002, the trial court sua sponte vacated the sentence imposed on May 21, 2001, presumably realizing that the parole violation sentence imposing three to six years of incarceration was improper because it set a minimum sentence and because its maximum exceeded the eleven and one-half to twenty-three month sentence Holmes received when sentenced for the original probation violation on September 16,1997.\nOn May 9, 2002, the Commonwealth appealed the court\u2019s April 9, 2002 order, claiming that the trial court lacked jurisdiction to vacate its prior\u2019 sentence. The Superior Court agreed in a published decision. Commonwealth v. Holmes, 837 A.2d 501, 502 (Pa.Super.2003). The court first noted that the trial court\u2019s action could not be justified as a reaction to a post-sentence motion because Holmes had not filed a post-sentence motion. The court next concluded that because the vacation of the sentence occurred more than thirty days after the imposition of the sentence on May 21, 2001, the trial court\u2019s action was impermissible under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5505, see, supra, at 58 n. 2, which allows a trial court to modify or rescind an order within thirty days of entry of that order, unless an appeal has been taken removing the case from the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction.\nWhile acknowledging that challenges to the legality of a sentence cannot be waived and that a court may raise sentence illegality sua sponte, the Superior Court cautioned that a trial court must first have jurisdiction to address the illegality, quoting our decisions in Robinson v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, 525 Pa. 505, 582 A.2d 857, 860 (1990) (\u201cJurisdiction is the predicate upon which a consideration of the merits must rest.\u201d), and Commonwealth v. Fahy, 558 Pa. 313, 737 A.2d 214, 223 (1999) (\u201cAlthough legality of sentence is always subject to review within the PCRA, claims must still first satisfy the PCRA\u2019s time limits or one of the exceptions thereto.\u201d).\nThe Superior Court rejected Holmes\u2019s argument that the trial court had inherent jurisdiction to correct patent and obvious errors in orders, distinguishing our decision in Commonwealth v. Jones, 520 Pa. 385, 554 A.2d 50 (1989), in which this Court approved a trial court\u2019s correction of an illegal sentence the day it was imposed. The Superior Court also distinguished Cole, 263 A.2d 339, in which this Court approved of the trial court\u2019s correction of an order over three months after its entry, because the order was internally inconsistent. The Superior Court concluded that the order sentencing Holmes was neither \u201cfacially self-contradictory or irreconcilable nor did it contain a clerical error.\u201d Holmes, 837 A.2d at 504. Accordingly, finding no jurisdiction for the trial court\u2019s order vacating the May 21, 2001 illegal sentence, the Superior Court reversed the order and reinstated that sentence.\nHolmes sought this Court\u2019s review, which we granted. Holmes relies on this Court\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]rial courts never relinquish their jurisdiction to correct an illegal sentence.\u201d Brief for Holmes at 5 (quoting Commonwealth v. Vasquez, 560 Pa. 381, 744 A.2d 1280, 1284 (2000)). He notes that while a violation of probation may trigger a new sentence, a violation of parole, as in the instant case, subjects a parolee to serve the balance of the original sentence. Compare 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9771 (\u201cUpon revocation [of probation] the sentencing alternatives available to the court shall be the same as were available at the time of initial sentencing ....\u201d) with Fair, 497 A.2d at 645 (noting that trial courts are bound by the limits of the original sentence in sentencing for a violation of parole); Commonwealth v. Ware, 737 A.2d 251, 253 (Pa.Super.1999) (\u201c[U]pon revocation of parole, the only sentencing option available is recommitment to serve the balance of the term initially imposed.\u201d).\nInitially, Holmes demonstrates that the sentence imposed could not be for a violation of probation because the trial court, in September 1997, revoked the probation imposed in May 1996. Thus, he could not have violated something that no longer existed. Consequently, he argues that the violation found in May 2001 related to his parole from the eleven and one-half to twenty-three-month sentence of incarceration imposed in September 1997. Accordingly, any sentence for that violation must be limited by the duration of the September 1997 sentence, twenty-three months. Citing Cole and Jones, Holmes contends that the trial court acted within its power to correct the obvious and patent mistake of sentencing him in excess of the original twenty-three-month sentence of September 1997 rather than recommitting him to serve the remainder of that sentence. Holmes also suggests that all illegal sentences are obvious and patent mistakes, citing numerous Superior Court cases for broad statements regarding courts\u2019 power to address illegal sentences.\nThe Commonwealth responds that the Superior Court properly reversed the trial court. It contends that the trial court lost jurisdiction to correct the order when the thirty-day period set forth in Section 5505 expired in June 2001. It notes the distinction between the issue of waiver and jurisdiction, quoting our explanation of jurisdiction as \u201cthe power, right, or authority to interpret and apply the law.\u201d Brief for Commonwealth (Holmes) at 12 (quoting Commonwealth v. Johnson, 542 Pa. 568, 669 A.2d 315, 321 (1995)). While acknowledging that a claim of sentence illegality may never be waived and may be addressed by a court sua sponte, it argues that the court must first have jurisdiction over the case to address the issue. Citing this Court\u2019s decision in Fahy, the Commonwealth contends that the only method for the trial court to have obtained jurisdiction to correct the sentence after the running of the thirty days would have been pursuant to the PCRA, which Holmes had not invoked as of April 2002, when the trial court vacated the senten\u00f3e.\nWhile tacitly acknowledging the authority of courts to correct clerical errors in orders, the Commonwealth contends that the sentencing illegality in this case is not a clerical error and that the defendant misinterprets our decisions in Cole and Jones to suggest that they provide the inherent power to correct illegal sentences at any time. Consistent with our observation in note 8, supra, the Commonwealth observes that there was no jurisdictional question in Jones, when the court acted immediately to correct the erroneous sentence, and, accordingly, that case is easily distinguished from the case at bar. The Commonwealth also argues that Cole is distinguishable because it involved an obvious clerical error apparent from the face of the order. It asserts that the merits of Holmes\u2019s claim are not as clear.\nBefore considering the merits of Holmes\u2019s claim, we first address the facts of the companion case, Commonwealth v. Whitfield, 24 EAP 2004. In May 1992, Rufus Whitfield pleaded guilty to auto theft, criminal conspiracy, theft by unlawful taking, receiving stolen property, and unauthorized use of a vehicle. He received sentences of probation of up to four years on several of these charges. On others, including CP# 9106-2343 and 9106-2344, which are relevant to this appeal, he received sentences of eleven and one-half to twenty-three months of incarceration, with all sentences to run concurrently. Accordingly, no probationary period was imposed at CP# 9106-2343 and 9106-2344, the information numbers relevant to this appeal.\nAccording to the trial court, Whitfield was paroled to a Community Corrections Center, from which he fled. He was arrested in October 1992 on a new theft charge. In June 1994, the court found a violation of the parole relating to the sentence imposed at CP# 9106-2343 and 9106-2344, but delayed sentencing. In February 1997, the trial court ordered Whitfield to serve the balance of the May 1992 sentence of eleven and one-half to twenty-three months of incarceration, and again released him on parole. The court noted that the probationary periods imposed in May 1992 in the other matters would expire in January 1998. Notes of Testimony, 2/19/1997, at 3.\nIn September 2001, after conviction on yet another charge, the court entered an order revoking Whitfield\u2019s \u201cprobation\u201d on the original sentence imposed at CP# 9106-2343 and 9106\u2014 2344 and sentencing him to three and one half to seven years of incarceration. However, as noted, probation had never been imposed for those charges. Whitfield filed an untimely motion for reconsideration with the court on October 16, 2001, which was denied. Additionally, Whitfield filed a motion to vacate the sentence, arguing that no probation had been imposed at CP# 9106-2343 and 9106-2344, and thus that the sentence was illegal. The court also denied this motion in March 2002.\nWhitfield appealed to the Superior Court in April 2002, asserting that his sentence for a putative probation violation was illegal because no probationary term had been imposed in the matters docketed at CP# 9106-2343 and 9106-2344. In May 2002, the trial court ordered Whitfield to file a Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement of matters complained of on appeal. Whitfield timely complied, despite the absence of a transcript. In the statement, Whitfield challenged the legality of the probation violation sentence. The court then directed the production of relevant transcripts. After some difficulty, the notes of testimony were produced and delivered to the trial court in September 2002.\nIn October 2002, notwithstanding the appeal pending in the Superior Court, the trial court determined that the sentence was illegal and entered an order vacating the sentence. The court explained:\nAt the time of [the hearing on September 26, 2001] this court inadvertently believed that the defendant was still on [its] probation. This court has recently obtained the notes of testimony from [the] February 19, 1997 hearing wherein it is indicated that the defendant would be finished with this [court\u2019s] probation on January 8,1998.\nOrder, 10/8/02. Having received the relief sought, Whitfield subsequently withdrew his appeal to the Superior Court, as he was no longer aggrieved.\nThe Commonwealth then appealed asserting that the trial court did not have jurisdiction to vacate the sentence during the pendency of Whitfield\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court. In its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the trial court rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s claim that the court did not have power to correct its sentencing order. The trial court stated that courts never relinquish their power to correct illegal sentences, as it did here.\nThe Superior Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s order correcting the sentence, relying on this Court\u2019s decisions in Cole and Commonwealth v. Klein, 566 Pa. 396, 781 A.2d 1133 (2001) (holding that a trial court had jurisdiction to correct manifest error in the calculation of sentence notwithstanding a pending appeal). The Superior Court held, \u201cthe [trial] court\u2019s correction was authorized by the legal necessity of rectifying a patent illegality.\u201d Super. Ct. Slip Op. at 4.\nThe Commonwealth, as appellant in Whitfield\u2019s case before this Court, claims that the alleged illegality in this case is not comparable to the clerical errors under Cole and Klein, and that the Superior Court erred in holding that a court may correct an illegal sentence at any time. The Commonwealth argues that not only had the thirty-day period for correction of orders under Section 5505 expired, but also that the court had been divested of jurisdiction when Whitfield appealed to the Superior Court. The Commonwealth further argues that the PCRA is the sole means for obtaining collateral relief. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9542 (\u201cThis subchapter provides for an action by which ... persons serving illegal sentences may obtain collateral relief. The action established in this subchapter shall be the sole means of obtaining collateral relief and encompasses all other common law and statutory remedies .... \u201d). As it did in response to Holmes\u2019s appeal, the Commonwealth maintains that the Superior Court and Whitfield have confused waiver and jurisdiction, quoting our decision in Fahy, 737 A.2d at 223 (\u201cAlthough legality of sentence is always subject to review within the PCRA, claims must still first satisfy the PCRA\u2019s time limits or one of the exceptions thereto.\u201d). It asserts that while claims of illegality cannot be waived, a court does not have perpetual jurisdiction to correct illegal sentences.\nWhitfield asserts that the lower courts correctly determined that the trial court had jurisdiction to vacate the order. He argues that the court\u2019s action in this case falls within its inherent power to correct obvious and patent mistakes, alleging that the mistake in this case, the imposition of a sentence for violation of a non-existent probation, is obvious and patent. He contends that the Commonwealth fails to explain its allegation that the errqr in this case is not an obvious or patent mistake, when the notations in the Quarter Session file, which is part of the certified record in this case, demonstrate that a probationary period was never imposed on Whitfield at CP# 9106-2343 and 9106-2344, the only matters relevant to this appeal.\nWhile acknowledging this Court\u2019s clear statements regarding the PCRA\u2019s jurisdictional prerequisites in Fahy and its progeny, Whitfield contends that \u201cthese cases did not consider whether such statutory jurisdictional requirements must give way to a trial court\u2019s inherent power to correct a manifest mistake in its order.\u201d Brief for Whitfield at 9. He argues that the statutory requirements must yield to the inherent power of courts, citing Cole, 263 A.2d at 341, in which we stated \u201c[b]oth before and since the passage of [the precursor to Section 5505], a court retains its inherent power to correct any patent mistakes in its orders.\u201d He also notes that this Court held in Klein, 781 A.2d 1133, that a court has jurisdiction to correct a manifest sentencing error even after the filing of an appeal, notwithstanding Section 5505, which would otherwise divest a court of jurisdiction to correct such an order. Whitfield also argues that public policy requires the approval of the trial court\u2019s actions to correct an erroneous sentence to avoid squandering judicial resources in situations involving patent errors that would result in relief on collateral review.\nThe question presented by the parties, regarding the power of courts to correct allegedly illegal sentencing orders absent jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. 5505 or the PCRA, is a question of law. Accordingly, our scope of review is plenary and our standard of review is de novo. See Commonwealth v. Cousin, 585 Pa. 287, 888 A.2d 710, 714 (2005).\nThe trial courts in both cases before us clearly lacked jurisdiction, absent the exercise of the rarely used power of the courts to correct patent errors. While the causes of the two trial courts\u2019 lack of jurisdiction are undeniably distinct, nonetheless, both are encompassed under the language of Section 5505, see, supra, at 58 n. 2, which recognizes the removal of jurisdiction upon appeal as in Whitfield\u2019s case, see Klein, 781 A.2d 1133, and the removal of jurisdiction upon the end of the term of court or the statutory thirty-day expansion of that time, as in Holmes\u2019s case, see Cole, 263 A.2d 339. Despite the different causes of the divestiture of jurisdiction, both cases fall within the limited class of cases amenable to the exercise by a trial court of the inherent power to correct patent errors despite the absence of traditional jurisdiction. As we have in the past, we hold today that the limits of jurisdiction enshrined in Section 5505 do not impinge on that time-honored inherent power of courts. See, e.g., Klein, 781 A.2d 1133; Commonwealth v. Cole, 263 A.2d at 341.\nIn Cole, we considered the tension between the predecessor to Section 5505 and a court\u2019s inherent power, and held that the statute \u201cwas never intended to eliminate the inherent power of a court to correct obvious and patent mistakes in its orders, judgments and decrees.\u201d Cole, 263 A.2d at 341. In that case, the trial court entered an order granting the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and arrest of judgment. Over three months after the entry of the order, well beyond the statutory jurisdictional period of thirty days, the trial court modified the order to dismiss the motion for arrest of judgment and to grant the motion for new trial. The defendant challenged, inter alia, the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction to amend the order based on the expiration of the thirty-day statutory period. This Court concluded that the trial court retained jurisdiction. We observed that \u201c[t]he grant of a new trial [a]nd the grant of the motion in arrest of judgment were so clearly antagonistic that even the most casual reading of the order would disclose the irreconcilable nature thereof.\u201d Id. at 341. We continued, \u201cif the motion in arrest of judgment was proper, Cole could not be tried again whereas, if the new trial were proper, the motion would have to fail.\u201d Id. As noted above, this Court, in approving the trial court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, relied on a string of cases dating back to the nineteenth century, recognizing a court\u2019s inherent power to correct patent mistakes. Id. at 341.\nMore recently, in Klein, we again noted the inherent power to correct patent and obvious errors. Notably, we did not limit the inherent power to those errors evident on the face of the order, but rather approved of a trial court\u2019s correction of a \u201cpatent defect or mistake in the record.\u201d Klein, 781 A.2d at 1135 (emphasis added). In Klein, the trial court sentenced the defendant and credited him -with thirty-three days of time served on June 23, 1999. On June 25, 1999, after the prison officials alerted the court to the fact that the defendant had only served one day, the trial court issued an order sua sponte directing \u201cthe Defendant to reappear for re-sentencing\u201d on June 30, 1999. Prior to the June 30 re-sentencing, the defendant filed a notice of appeal of the June 23 sentencing order, thus terminating the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. The trial court, on June 30, rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the court did not have jurisdiction, and amended the order to indicate only one day of time served. This Court on review found the trial court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction appropriate under Cole, even though the error was not obvious on the face of the order but emerged only in light of information provided by a third party.\nHolmes\u2019s sentencing order, like the order in Cole, contained a patent mistake, a fact apparent from a review of the docket without resort to third-party information. The order stated, \u201cparole is hereby revoked,\u201d and then sentenced Holmes to serve \u201cNot less than three (3) years nor more than six (6) years in the State Correctional Institution, to run concurrently with any sentence now serving.\u201d Trial Court Order, 5/21/01. The Commonwealth has not disputed that the sentence imposed was in direct conflict with the longstanding precedent that a parole violator cannot be sentenced to a new sentence but instead can only be recommitted to the remainder of the original sentence. See Fair, 497 A.2d 643. There is no dispute that Holmes\u2019s original sentence entailed a maximum of twenty-three months of incarceration. Considering that the error of the sentence was clear from the order and the docket sheet, the trial court properly exercised its inherent power to correct the mistake.\nSimilarly, Appellant Whitfield is entitled to the relief granted by the trial court under our caselaw upholding the inherent jurisdiction of courts to correct patent and obvious mistakes. The trial court imposed a new sentence of incarceration on Whitfield for a violation of probation even though probation was never imposed. While the mistake is not apparent based on the face of the order itself, one need only look to the Quarter Session notes in the record to see the mistake.\nAlthough the defendants before this court warrant relief under the inherent power of courts to correct patent errors, we must also emphasize the limits of this power. This exception to the general rule of Section 5505 cannot expand to swallow the rule. In applying the exception to the cases at bar, we note that it is the obviousness of the illegality, rather than the illegality itself, that triggers the court\u2019s inherent power. Not all illegal sentences will be amenable to correction as patent errors. Moreover, the inherent power to correct errors does not extend to reconsideration of a court\u2019s exercise of sentencing discretion. A court may not vacate a sentencing order merely because it later considers a sentence too harsh or too lenient. The cases at bar are not cases where a court reconsidered the application of its sentencing discretion or its interpretation of a nuanced or ambiguous statutory provision. These cases involve clear errors in the imposition of sentences that were incompatible with the record, as in Whitfield, or black letter law, as in Holmes. As we have in the past, we emphasize that this is a limited judicial power. Nonetheless, we find it applicable to the cases at bar. Accordingly, we approve of the trial court\u2019s orders vacating the illegal sentences. Thus, the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Whitfield is affirmed, and the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Holmes is reversed.\nJustice CASTILLE and SAYLOR join the opinion.\nJustice BALDWIN files a concurring opinion.\nJustice FITZGERALD files a concurring opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a dissenting opinion in which Chief Justice CAPPY joins.\n. This case was reassigned to this author.\n. \u00a7 5505. Modification of orders\nExcept as otherwise provided or prescribed by law, a court upon notice to the parties may modify or rescind any order within 30 days after its entry, notwithstanding the prior termination of any term of court, if no appeal from such order has been taken or allowed.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5505.\n. The record reveals that Holmes received credit for time served from February 27, 1996, to May 17, 1996.\n. The record does not clarify why the trial court revoked Holmes's probation rather than the parole from the original sentence of May 17, 1996. However, there is no dispute regarding the fact that the September 16, 1997 sentence was imposed for a probation violation.\n. The difference between these often confused terms is crucial to the cases at bar. As commonly defined, probation is \"La] sentence imposed for commission of crime whereby a convicted criminal offender is released into the community under the supervision of a probation officer in lieu of incarceration.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, 835 (6th ed.1991). Conversely, parole is the \u201c[rjelease from jail, prison or other confinement after actually serving part of the sentence. Conditional release from imprisonment which entitles parolee to serve remainder of his term outside the confines of an institution, if he satisfactorily complies with all terms and conditions provided in parole order.\u201d Id. at 770. As is relevant, a court faced with a violation of probation may impose a new sentence so long as it is within the sentencing alternatives available at the time of the original sentence. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9771(b) (\"Upon revocation [of probation] the sentencing alternatives available to the court shall be the same as were available at the time of initial sentencing, due consideration being given to the time spent serving the order of probation.\u201d). In contrast, a court faced with a parole violation must recommit the parolee to serve the remainder of the original sentence of imprisonment, from which the prisoner could be reparoled. See Commonwealth v. Fair, 345 Pa.Super. 61, 497 A.2d 643, 645 (1985) (\"The power of the court after a finding of violation of parole in cases not under the control of the State Board of Parole is \u2018to recommit to jail.... \u2019 There is no authority for giving a new sentence with a minimum and maximum.\u201d (internal citation omitted)).\n. The record does not reveal the trial court's specific reasoning for vacation of its prior decision. The signed order of April 9, 2002, merely stated: \"it is hereby ORDERED that the illegal sentence of 3 to 6 years imposed on May 21, 2001, on the above Bill and Term Number(s) is VACATED, and the Court\u2019s supervision is terminated.\u201d It is apparent, however, that the illegality hinged on the court\u2019s imposition of an unauthorized sentence for the parole violation.\n. The Commonwealth currently alleges that the trial court failed to provide the Commonwealth with notice of its intent to enter the April 2002 order vacating the May 21, 2001 sentence. However, because the Commonwealth did not raise that issue before the Superior Court, we will not address it at this stage of the appellate process. See Commonwealth v. Holmes, 837 A.2d 501, 502 (Pa.Super.2003) (\"The Commonwealth has taken the instant appeal from the April 9, 2002 order, raising the single issue: \u2019Was the lower court\u2019s ex parte order purporting to vacate defendant's sentence entered without jurisdiction?\u2019 \u201d).\n. The issue in Jones was whether an illegal sentence could be increased after a defendant has begun serving it or whether such action violated the double jeopardy clauses of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. Jones, 554 A.2d at 52. The sentencing error involved the imposition of a minimum term in excess of half the maximum term, in violation of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9756(b). The court realized the illegality of the sentence within hours of the original sentencing and increased the maximum sentence, out of the presence of the defendant, to comply with Section 9756. The next day the trial court called the defendant into court to inform him that the sentences imposed orally had been corrected. This Court concluded that its actions did not violate the double jeopardy clauses. We note that the court\u2019s action was clearly taken within the thirty-day window created by 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5505. Thus, Jones is not helpful in disposing of the cases before us.\n. As discussed in detail infra, the original order in Cole provided for both the \"grant of a new trial\u201d and the \u201carrest of judgment,\u201d which we determined to be \"so clearly antagonistic that even the most casual reading of the order would disclose the irreconcilable nature thereof.\u201d Cole, 263 A.2d at 341. The trial court amended the order to delete the grant of arrest of judgment. This Court approved the trial court\u2019s actions, holding that even after the enactment of the predecessor to Section 5505, \"a court retains its inherent power to correct any patent mistakes in its orders.\u201d Id.\n. In the interim, Holmes filed a petition for post-conviction relief. The trial court dismissed it in October 2004 because post-conviction actions must await resolution of the appeal pending before this Court.\n. In Vasquez, we considered whether a trial court had authority to add to a sentence a mandatory fine it had initially neglected to impose. Vasquez is distinguishable because it addressed trial court actions upon remand by the Superior Court, when the trial court's jurisdiction was without question.\n. Additionally, without directly disputing the impropriety of a sentence of three to six years of incarceration for a parole violation arising from the September 16, 1997 sentence of eleven and one-half to twenty-three months of incarceration, the Commonwealth asserts that the trial court actually revoked Holmes\u2019s probation and thus sentenced him properly for a probation violation. However, the records demonstrate that Holmes was not on probation at the relevant time because probation had been revoked in September 1997.
