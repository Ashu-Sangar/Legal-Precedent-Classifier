{"id": "582281", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nAppellant Peter E. Platou was convicted of possession of marijuana and sentenced to serve two years probation and to pay a $500 fine. He moved before trial to suppress the marijuana seized from his effects. After the denial of his motion, appellant was tried non-jury. At trial the challenged evidence was introduced over objection. Appellant was adjudged guilty, and the Superior Court affirmed in a per curiam opinion-less order. Commonwealth v. Platou, 220 Pa. Superior Ct. 779, 286 A. 2d 402 (1972). We granted allocatur to consider whether the seizure of marijuana from appellant violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. We hold it did. We reverse and grant a new trial.\nAt the time of the search appellant was a guest in the apartment of his friend, Robert Wander. On the basis of a sale of marijuana by Wander to a police agent, an arrest warrant for him and a search warrant for his premises were obtained. The police arrested Wander at his place of work and accompanied by him proceeded to Ms apartment. At this time, the police had no knowledge of appellant\u2019s existence. Approaching the apartment, Wander informed the police that he had a friend visiting him. When the police arrived they read the warrant to Wander and entered. Although it is unclear exactly what next transpired, the record does establish that the police announced they had authority to search everything in the apartment and that appellant claimed the two suitcases lying on the floor of Wander\u2019s apartment were his. Despite being on notice that the suitcases did not belong to Wander, the police began searching them simultaneously with their initiating a search of the apartment. In one of appellant\u2019s suitcases they found a single ounce of marijuana.\nThe Commonwealth attempts to justify its search of appellant\u2019s suitcases solely on the ground that it was authorized by a valid Avarrant. It argues that because the suitcases were separated from appellant\u2019s person and located within Wander\u2019s apartment, they were properly searched. We disagree.\nThe search of appellant\u2019s suitcases under the authority of the search warrant for Wander\u2019s apartment is analagous to those situations in which consent searches have been invalidated because the place or thing searched was in the exclusive control or possession of a nonconsenting party, and the consenting party did not have \u201can independent right of his own to consent to the seizure . . . Commonwealth v. Storek, 442 Pa. 197, 200, 275 A. 2d 362, 364 (1971); see Cunningham v. Heinze, 352 F. 2d 1, 4-5 (9th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 968, 86 S. Ct. 1274 (1966); Reeves v. Warden, 346 F. 2d 915 (4th Cir. 1965); Holzhey v. United States, 223 F. 2d 823 (5th Cir. 1955); United States v. Blok, 188 F. 2d 1019 (D.C. Cir. 1951); United States v. Poole, 307 F. Supp. 1185 (E.D. La. 1969); cf. Frazier v. Cupp, 394 U.S. 731, 740, 89 S. Ct. 1420, 1425 (1969). It is controlled by the same rationale. The reasoning of these \u201cconsent\u201d search cases is that a person cannot waive the Fourth Amendment rights of another with respect to property owned or possessed by that other person.\nLike consent, a warrant fulfills the Fourth Amendment requirement that searches be reasonable. But a warrant can only authorize a search of the place or thing for which an affidavit containing facts constituting probable cause has been submitted. If a warrant permits the search of premises or effects of a particular person, as here, then it cannot be extended by the officer executing the warrant to include a search of things not belonging to or under the control of that person. In the instant case, it is undisputed that Wander had no control over appellant\u2019s effects. Moreover, the police before undertaking their search were on notice that the suitcases belonged to appellant, and not Wander. The property of appellant cannot be searched under the authority of a warrant for the premises of Wander. If it could, appellant would not be afforded his Fourth Amendment guarantee with respect to his property, because no magistrate ever decided that probable cause existed for the search of his effects.\nTo hold that the search of appellant\u2019s suitcases was authorized by the search warrant for Wander\u2019s apartment would offend the Fourth Amendment\u2019s directive that \u201cno Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause . . . particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d The police had no knowledge of the existence of appellant, or of his property, prior to the time they entered Wander\u2019s apartment. A fortiori, neither did the issuing magistrate. The warrant therefore could not possibly have described appellant\u2019s effects. If the officer executing the warrant, by his own choice, could extend its reach by searching things not particularly described therein, the constitutional prescription of particularity would be violated. \u201cThe requirement that warrants shall particularly describe the things to be seized malees general searches under them impossible and prevents the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another. As to what is to be taken, nothing is left to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant.\u201d Marron v. United, States, 275 U.S. 192, 196, 48 S. Ct. 74, 76 (1927); see Stanford v. Texas, 379 U.S. 476, 85 S. Ct. 506 (1965); Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 6 S. Ct. 524 (1886); Commonwealth v. Matthews, 446 Pa. 65, 72-74, 285 A. 2d 510, 513-14 (1971).\nOur determination here is in accord with Commonwealth v. Reece, 437 Pa. 422, 263 A. 2d 463 (1970). There, this Court held that police, validly within an apartment under the authority of a search warrant, unconstitutionally searched persons who happened to be on the premises and about whom the police had no information suggesting involvement in criminal activity. Implicit in Reece was this Court\u2019s refusal to sanction the right of an officer executing a search warrant to extend its scope to cover persons or things not particularly described in the warrant. Our conclusion is consistent with the reasoning in United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 68 S. Ct. 222 (1948), and with the result reached in other jurisdictions.\nThe facts of Reece are strikingly akin to those of the instant case. There the police, acting on an informant\u2019s tip, obtained a search warrant for an apartment where a \u201cpot\u201d party was supposedly going to be held. As persons entered the apartment, the police searched them. Those found with narcotics were arrested. In both Reece and the present case, the police had no information about the visitors; no indicia existed to suggest criminal activity; the crime charged was possession of marijuana, \u201ca crime [which] by its very nature is unique to the individual.\u201d Reece, supra at 427, 263 A. 2d at 466. In both, guilt by association was the sole rationale for the search and subsequent arrest. See Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 62-66, 88 S. Ct. 1889, 1902-04 (1968).\nWhile recognizing the applicability of Reece to the present case, the Commonwealth has attempted to distinguish it. The only factual distinction is that the search in Reece was of the guest\u2019s person, and here the search was of the guest\u2019s effects. There is no constitutional difference.\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated . . . .\u201d A person does not lose the protection of the Fourth Amendment by entering the apartment of another. Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 352, 88 S. Ct. 507, 511 (1967); Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 261-67, 80 S. Ct. 725, 731-34 (1960); Reece, supra. Neither do a person\u2019s effects. The Fourth Amendment permits no lesser protection for a person\u2019s effects, than for his person. So long as a person seeks to preserve his effects as private, even if they are accessible to the public or to others, they are constitutionally protected. Katz, supra at 351, 88 S. Ct. at 511. Stated differently, a person must maintain the privacy of his possessions in such a fashion that his \u201cexpectations of freedom from intrusion are recognized as reasonable.\u201d Id. at 361, 88 S. Ct. at 517 (Hablan, J., concurring).\nPersonal belongings brought by their owner on a visit to a friend\u2019s house retain their constitutional protection until their owner meaningfully abdicates control or responsibility. Appellant\u2019s placing his suitcases on the floor of Wander\u2019s apartment and opening one of them does not amount to an abandonment of his control. Appellant maintained his reasonable expectation of privacy. And therefore the search of his suitcases was unreasonable and constitutionally impermissible.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed. The judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford County is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones dissents.\nThe Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, Act of September 26, 1961, P. L. 1664, \u00a74, 35 P.S. \u00a7780-4, as amended, The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, Act of April 14, 1972, P.

Our discussion of the Fourth Amendment is equally applicable to the state constitutional provision.\nOne of appellant\u2019s suitcases was open, the other closed. For the purpose of our analysis, this makes no difference.\nIn the midst of searching appellant\u2019s suitcases, one of the searching officers admonished appellant that \u201cLi]f there\u2019s Marijuana in here we are going to find it and you might as well tell us where it is.\u201d Transcript of Suppression Hearing at 7 (Apr. 30, 1970). Ax>pellant complied and it was then that the single ounce of marijuana was discovered. The \u201cburden [of proving consent] cannot be discharged by showing no more than acquiescence to a claim of unlawful authority.\u201d Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 548-49, 88 S. Ct. 1788, 1792 (1968); Commonwealth v. Harris, 429 Pa. 215, 221, 239 A. 2d 290, 293 (1968). The Commonwealth has not attempted to justify the search as consensual, and could not prevail if it did.\nIf the search of appellant\u2019s suitcases was not authorized by the search warrant for AVander\u2019s apartment, the Commonwealth would have had to prove that an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement existed to justify the warrantless search. It must be remembered that all warrantless searches are per se unreasonable absent exigent circumstances. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S. Ct. 1868 (1968); Commonwealth v. Cockfield, 431 Pa. 639, 246 A. 2d 381 (1968). Because no probable cause existed to arrest appellant prior to the search of his suitcases, the search cannot be considered as incident to a valid arrest. Commonwealth v. Reece, 437 Pa. 422, 263 A. 2d 463 (1970). In any event, appellant\u2019s suitcases were beyond the area of his control, where he could possibly utilize a hidden weapon, and therefore the search could not constitutionally be justified as necessary for the officer\u2019s protection. Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034 (1969). The single ounce of marijuana, although found in the opened suitcase, was inside a shoe which in turn was inside a shoe sock. It was not in plain view. See Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U.S. 443, 464-73, 91 S. Ct 2022, 2037-42 (1971); Harris v. United States, 390 U.S. 234, 88 S. Ct. 992 (1968); Ker v. California, 374 U.S. 23, 43, 83 S. Ct. 1623, 1635 (1963). Consent is not here at issue. See note 4 supra.\nProbable cause for a search warrant may be supported by sworn oral testimony. Commonwealth v. Milliken, 450 Pa. 310, 300 A. 2d 78 (1973); Pa. R. Crim. P. 2003.\nThe Commonwealth does not contend, as Indeed It could not, that the search was reasonable because justified by an exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement. See note 5 supra.\nThe Pennsylvania Constitution similarly provides that \u201cno warrant to search any place or to seize any person or things shall issue without describing them as nearly as may be . . . .\u201d Pa. Const. art. 1, \u00a78.\nIn United, States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 68 S. Ct. 222 (1948), Di Re was convicted of knowingly possessing counterfeit gasoline ration coupons on the basis of evidence seized from him. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held both Di Re\u2019s arrest and search illegal, and reversed the judgment of the district court. The Supreme Court affirmed.\nIn Di Re, federal officials, acting on an informer\u2019s tip, stopped an automobile in which Di Re was a passenger and without a warrant searched him. The government defended its search on the ground, inter alia, that incident to a warrantless search of an automobile, all occupants justifiably could be searched. The Court concluded that no search of the car took place, and so avoided deciding whether an automobile because of its mobile nature could be searched without a warrant more readily than other property. Id. at 586, 68 S. Ct. at 224.\nIt did, however, address the question whether a right to search an automobile without a warrant conferred an incidental right to search all of its occupants. \u201cThe Government says it would not contend that, armed with a search warrant for a residence only, it could search all persons found in it. But an occupant of a house could be used to conceal this contraband on his person quite as readily as can an occupant of a car. Necessity, an argument advanced in support of this search, would seem as strong a reason for searching guests of a house for which a search warrant had issued as for search of guests in a car for which none had been issued. By a parity of reasoning with that on which the Government disclaims the right to search occupants of a house, we suppose the Government would not contend that if it had a valid search warrant for the car only it could search the occupants as an incident to its execution. How then could we say that the right to search a car without a warrant confers greater latitude to search occupants than a search by warrant would permit?\u201d Id. at 587, 68 S. Ct. at 225.\nUnited States v. Poole, 307 F. Supp. 1185, 1190-91 (E.D. La. 1969); United States v. Haywood, 284 F. Supp. 245, 250 (E.D. La. 1968); United States v. Festa, 192 F. Supp. 160, 163 (D.
