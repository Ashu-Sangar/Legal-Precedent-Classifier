{"id": "8845559", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Chief Justice MAxey,\nThis is an appeal by Aaron Turner from a conviction of murder in the first degree, committed during the perpetration of a robbery. The sentence fixed by the jury was death.\nThe defendant and Jasper Johnson,- alias \u201cFats\u201d and \u201cPlayboy\u201d, entered the Ace Broom factory located at 355-57 North 2nd St., Philadelphia, at or about five o\u2019clock Saturday afternon, December 15, 1945, with the intention of committing a robbery. Clarence Lofton remained in front of the establishment as \u201clook-out\u201d. Turner, who was armed with an iron sash'-weight, entered the premises first. There he\u2019 and Johnson met Frank Endres, a factory employee. Turner twice struck Endres over the head with the iron, felling him and Johnson \u201cgot his wallet from him.\u201d The proprietor, Charles Simmons, who was in the rear of the store, upon hearing the scuffle came to the front. When he appeared he was hit \u201ca couple of times and he went down\u201d. Turner \u201cwent into his pockets\u201d and took the wallet containing \u201cover $100\u201d. The two felons left the building, joined Lofton, divided the loot and went to a taproom at \u201c8th and Callowhill and had a few drinks\u201d. A policeman passing the premises discovered that the door was open and entered the place. He found the victims lying in \u201cpools of blood and beaten about the head\u201d. He had them removed to the hospital. Two days later Endres died. Simmons died seven days later. There were no witnesses to the crime except its victims and perpetrators.\nDefendant was arrested without warrant at 11 a.m., June 3, 1946, six months after the commission of the crime. Information leading to his arrest was volunteered by Lofton, who was apprehended on May 25,1946 in connection with an investigation conducted into a series of crimes. Johnson was arrested on June 3, 1946 about four-thirty in the afternoon. Turner was held in police custody until June 8, 1946 when he was brought before a magistrate.\nAt the trial Detective Daniel O\u2019Mahoney testified that Turner was arrested at 11:00 a.m. on June 3, 1946, and was taken to the office of the Homicide Division in City Hall and interrogated about the killing of Endres and Simmons. No threats were made against him and no promises were given him. He was questioned a few hours every day until June 7th, when Turner said he wished to tell the truth, that what the other two men had told about him was true and that he would tell all about it. Turner said: \u201cI was at the broom factory and I struck two men with a piece of iron\u201d. On the first day of his arrest Turner was interrogated for about three hours and on the next day for about three hours. This continued for five days until the admission of guilt was made. Detective Fisher also questioned the defendant in O\u2019Mahoney\u2019s presence. \u201cSometimes Detective Carey Avas there and sometimes Detective Lennon was there and Sergeant Riccardi was there and Detective Thompson was there and Lieutenant Kelly took an active part in the questioning of this man.\u201d Sometimes the questioning was done in Turner\u2019s cell and sometimes in a room about 12 feet square at police headquarters. He said that during this period Turner never asked us \u201cto get in touch with his friends or relatives\u201d. He was asked: \u201cDid you ever tell Turner anything he might say coxild be used against him?\u201d He said that he did so \u201con the night that he said he wanted to tell the truth. That is the 7th of June\u201d.\nThe questions asked Turner and the answers which he gave after he said he wished to tell the truth were taken down stenographically and transcribed. Turner signed each of the sheets of the transcript containing the questions and answers. Turner described the weapon he used in the killing as \u201ca piece of iron, about 11 inches long, 2% inches wide, % inch thick, with a hole in the end.\u201d He was asked: \u201cHow many times did you hit the white men over the head when you entered the premises at 355 North 2nd Street on December 15,1945, at about 5:00 p.m. ?\u201d He answered: \u201cI hit the first man twice and I seen Fats get his wallet from him. Q. How many times did you hit the second man? A. I only hit him a couple of times and he went down and I went into his pockets and his wallet and took the wallet and went out with it. There was something over $100.00. I don\u2019t know how much. I threw it away while walking out Callow-hill Street. Q. How much money did you give Clarence Lofton? A. $87.00. Q. How much money did you give Jasper Johnson, alias Fats? A. I didn\u2019t give him any money. He said he got $50.00. Q. How much money did Jasper Johnson give you? A. I don\u2019t know how much he gave me but I gave Clarence $87.00, out of it and I kept $75.00.\u201d\nJasper Johnson and Clarence Lofton also made statements about the killing. These statements were all made in the presence of Turner and they agreed in detail. Each one of the three accused signed each page of each statement.\nAt the trial Turner denied the truth of his confession and asserted that it had been procured from him by fear and physical abuse. In submitting to the jury the question whether or not the confession was voluntary and uncoerced the trial judge correctly said: \u201cThen, before the confession may be admitted in evidence, the jury must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession has been a free and voluntary one, not induced by fear, coercion, or promise held out, or inducement held out to the defendant. You must first find that the confession was a voluntary statement made by the defendant of his own free will. That seems to me to be the crhx of this case.\n\u201cFor the same reason, if you do not believe this confession was a free and voluntary one, then you have no right to consider it in the evidence. If you believe beyond a reasonable doubt it is a free and voluntary confession, not induced by fear, coercion or inducement held out, or by threats made, then you may accept the confession in your consideration of all the evidence.\u201d\nOn the factual issue the jury after hearing the evidence.found against Turner and accepted his confession as being uncoerced and true. As. to the confession the court well said in its opinion refusing a new trial: \u201c. . . the defendant is. not a poor negro of a low degree of intelligence. From , an observation of him and listening to his testimony, it is apparent that he is a smart, clever individual. It is apparent that his confession was not concocted by others, and it .is clear that it is not a fabrication created by another mind or minds. The statement as given by the defendant is logical and only consistent with his guilt and that of his confederates. It shows that the defendant had this broom factory under observation two days before the murders and that he and his confederates went to the factory on that Saturday afternoon after the close of the business day, for the purpose of robbery. . . . The confession of the defendant and the confessions of his confederates stated what each gave to the other in the way of cash after they had fled from the scene of their crimes. The confession of the defendant shows that in going out Callowhill Street, he threw the sash weight away; that the three confederates then went to saloons where they had some drinks, and that they then parted, promising each other that they would say nothing about the crime. A reading of the confession shows that the defendant was asked whether he had been threatened or harmed and whether he had been promised anything, and it also contains the caution that anything he might say, might be used against him. The defendant was asked if he knew, when he was arrested, what the charge was and he said, \u2018yes, sir, for the murdering of those two men in the broom factory.\u2019 \u201d\nAnyone with experience in the administration of criminal law who reads the answers Turner made to the questions put to him will readily conclude that the statements he made to the officers were not those of a coerced or scared witness but that they were the statements of a man who had committed a murder and whose recital of its details was clear and explicit. The teller of the gruesome story of this double murder was obviously drawing on his memory and not on a fear-fired imagination. His narrative. dovetailed so accurately with the physical facts surrounding the crime and with the story told by his accomplices that there can be no reasonable doubt of the story\u2019s truthfulness.\nWe said in Commonwealth v. Spardute, 278 Pa. 37, 48, 122 Atl. 161, that \u201cWhere, by the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, it is shown that a confession is made voluntarily, without* such threat or inducement as might secure a false confession, it must be admitted. If after-wards the defendant testifies, or produces other witnesses who testify, that it was not voluntarily made, it becomes a question for the jury.\u201d (Citing six cases and citing also Underhill on Criminal Evidence, 2d ed., section 126, p. 242.)\nIn Commonwealth v. Jones, 341 Pa. 541, 19 A. 2d 389, we held that tbe mere fact that defendant was under arrest or was in charge of armed officers and that he was not represented by counsel at the time he made his confession will not make the confession involuntary. As Chief Justice Paxson, speaking for the court, said in Commonwealth v. Clark, 130 Pa. 641, 650, 18 Atl. 988, \u201c. . . when a criminal wants to ease his mind by a voluntary confession, it would be a weak sentimentalism to interfere with his doing so.\u201d\nThere is nothing in the Constitution or the statutes of Pennsylvania or in the decisions and opinions of this court during the two and a quarter centuries of its existence, requiring that a convicted murderer be turned loose merely because he has not been taken before a magistrate immediately after his arrest or because he was held five days in jail and interrogated a few hours each day by police officers without being given an opportunity to consult with counsel or with friends. Of course, if during that period he was denied food, water, sleep or rest, or if he was beaten or manhandled or threatened or given inducements to confess his guilt, any admission of guilt extracted from him by such means would be judicially rejected as worthless.\nWe find nothing in any decision of the United States Supreme Court applying the \u201cdue process of law\u201d guarantee of the 14th Amendment which would justify us in adjudging Turner\u2019s confession inadmissible and which would thereby require his release from custody. The United States Supreme Court has frequently declared in effect that a state\u2019s long-established interpretation of its own constitution\u2019s \u201cdue process\u201d clause is entitled to respect and great weight by the Federal judiciary. In Otis Co. v. Ludlow Co., 201 U. S. 140, 154, Justice Holmes speaking for the court said: \u201cwe cannot wholly neglect the long settled law and common understanding of a particular State in considering the plaintiff\u2019s rights. We are bound to be very cautious in coming to the conclusion that the Fourteenth Amendment has upset what thus has been established and accepted for a long time.\u201d\nAppellant bases his plea for release chiefly upon the case of McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332. The decision in favor of the prisoners in that case, who had been convicted of murder in a Federal District Court, was expressly based on \u201cthe standards\u201d of federal criminal procedure. The Supreme Court after stating that it had \u201con Constitutional grounds, set aside convictions, both in the federal and state courts, which were based upon confessions \u2018secured by protracted and repeated questioning of ignorant and untutored persons, in whose minds the power of officers was greatly magnified,\u2019 [citing case] or \u2018who have been unlawfully held incommunicado without advice of friends or counsel,\u2019 \u201d [citing cases] said:\n\u201cIn the view we take of the case, however, it becomes unnecessary to reach the Constitutional issue pressed upon us. For, while the power of this Court to undo convictions in state courts is limited to the enforcement of those \u2018fundamental principles of liberty and justice,\u2019 Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U.S. 312, 316, which are secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, the scope of our reviewing power over convictions brought here from the federal courts is not confined to ascertainment of Constitutional validity. . . , Moreover, review by this Court of state action expressing its notion of what will best further its own security in the administration of criminal justice demands appropriate respect for the deliberative judgment of a state in so basic an exercise of its jurisdiction. . . . Quite apart from the Constitution, therefore, we are constrained to hold that the evidence elicited from the petitioners in the circumstances disclosed here must be excluded. For in their treatment of the petitioners the arresting officers assumed functions which Congress has explicitly denied them. . . . The circumstances in which the statements admitted in evidence against the petitioners were secured reveal a plain disregard of the duty enjoined by Congress upon federal law officers. ... In holding that the petitioners\u2019 admissions were improperly received in evidence against them, and that having been based on this evidence their convictions cannot stand, we confine ourselves to our limited function as the court of ultimate review of the standards formulated and applied by federal courts in the trial of criminal cases.\u201d\nThe McNabb case is clearly not an authority for holding that a conviction secured in a state court by the confession of a defendant will be set aside as a violation of the \u201cdue process\u201d clause of the 14th Amendment because the prisoner was not immediately taken before a magistrate or. because be was interrogated without the presence of friends or counsel.\nIn United States v. Mitchell, 322 U.S. 65, where it was held by the United States Supreme Court that the admission of guilt by a prisoner was admissible in evidence in a criminal-prosecution in a federal court, and that the admissibility of the evidence was not affected by the subsequent illegal detention of the suspect for eight days before arraignment, Mr. Justice Reed in his concurring opinion said: \u201cAs I understand McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, as explained by the Court\u2019s opinion of today, the McNabb rule is that where there has been illegal detention of a prisoner, joined with other circumstances which are deemed by this Court to be contrary to proper conduct of federal prosecutions, the confession will not be admitted. ... If the above understanding is correct, it is for me a d\u00e9sirable modification of the McNabb case. . . . The juristic theory under which a confession' should be admitted or barred is bottomed on the testimonial trustworthiness of the conf\u00e9ssion. If the confession is freely made without inducement or menace, it is admissible.\u201d\nA recent case in the United States Supreme Court on this subject is that of Malinski et al. v. New York, 324 U.S. 401, in which the Court in a \u201cfive to four\u201d decision held that the. confession by an accused was inadmissible in evidence as being a coerced confession. The majority decision was based upon a statement which was made by the prosecuting attorney in summing up his case for the state, in which he .used the following language: \u201c \u2018Why this talk about being undressed? Of course, they had a right to undress him to look fpr bullet scars, and keep the clothes off him. That was quite proper police procedure. That is some more psychology-let him sit around with a blanket on him, humiliate him there for a while; let him sit in the corner, let him think he is going to get a shellacking.\u2019 \u201d\nThe Supreme Court said: \u201cIf we take the prosecutor at his word, the confession of October 23rd was the product of fear \u2014 one on which we could not permit a person to stand convicted for a crime.\u201d The Supreme Court then added, \u201cBut it is said that, this coerced confession was not introduced in evidence, that it was submitted to the jury only insofar as it threw light on the voluntary character of the subsequent confessions. . . The Supreme Court further said: \u201cThere were repeated references at the trial to the confession of October 23rd. The prosecutor made emphatic references to it in his summation. On this record the fact that Malinski confessed to the crime shortly after he was arrested stands out in bold relief. The use made of the confession could hardly have been more effective had its details been put in evidence. It was not insulated from the trial.\u201d The Supreme Court then said: \u201cWe must consider the case, therefore, as one in which a coerced confession was employed to obtain a conviction.\u201d In that case Chief Justice Stone in his dissenting opinion, in which he was joined by Mr. Justice Roberts, Mr. Justice Reed, and Mr. Justice Jackson, said:\n\u201cAnd the jury was instructed that it could consider the second confession, only if it found it voluntary, and that it could convict in that case. In view of these instructions, we cannot say that the first confession was submitted to the jury, or that, in the absence of any exception or request to charge more particularly, there was any error of which petitioner can complain. Hence the jury\u2019s verdict must be taken as conclusively establishing that the second confession was voluntary and was not induced by any coercion attending the first. Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U.S. 596. . . . It is not the function of this Court, in reviewing, on constitutional grounds, criminal convictions by state courts, to weigh the evidence on which the jury has pronounced its verdict, also in the light of the arguments of counsel, or to sit as a super-jury. We have, in appropriate cases, set aside state convictions as violating due process where we were able to say that the case was improperly submitted to the jury or that the unchallenged evidence plainly showed a violation of the constitutional rights of the accused. . . . The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned with matters of substance. It cannot rightly be made the instrument of reform of the manners of state officials. And however reprehensible or even criminal the acts of state officials may be, in so far as the conduct of the trial is concerned, they do not infringe due process unless they result in the use against the accused of evidence which is coerced or known to the State to be fraudulent or perjured, or unless they otherwise deny to him the substance of a fair trial, which is due process. [Citing cases.] Judged by these standards, we think that there was no denial of due process in submitting petitioner Malinski\u2019s confession to the jury in the manner in which they were in fact submitted, and that there is no constitutional ground for setting aside the jury\u2019s verdict against him.\u201d\nThe majority of the United States Supreme Court held that the remarks of the prosecuting attorney in his summation to the jury amounted to an admission by him that the confession of the prisoner was coerced. The minority took the view that the \u201cprosecutor did not testify in the case ... or had any knowledge of the alleged coercion . . . the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not tend to prove anything more than his own ineptitude. ... It is not the function of this Court ... to sit as a super-jury.\u201d\nIn the instant case there was no coercion of Turner, either admitted or proved. His answers to the questions put to him revealed intrinsically the voluntary character of his statements, and the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses furnished additional proof that Turner was not coerced into talking falsely against himself. The trial judge in admitting Turner\u2019s incriminating statements and submitting them to the jury with proper instructions for testing their - truthfulness followed, the, rules sanctioned by this court during its entire existence. In Commonwealth v. Dillon, 4 Dallas 105 (1792), this Court said; \u201cIf-such [incriminating] declarations are-voluntarily made, all the. world will agree,, that they furnish the strongest evidence of- imputed guilt. . . .- The true point for consideration, therefore, is, whether the prisoner has falsely declared himself guilty, of a-capital offence?\u2019\u2019 \u2019\u2022 \u2019 -\nIn Commonwealth v. Goodwin, 186 Pa. 218, this Court in an opinion by Justice Mitchell cites with approval the following from Wharton on Criminal Evidence, sec. !644: \u201c'\u2018Though it is necessary to the admissibility 'of a confession that it should have been voluntarily made, that is, that it should have been made without the appliances- of hope- or fear from persons having authority; yet it is hot necessary that it should have beeh the prisoner\u2019s own spontaneous act. It will be received, though it were induced by spiritual exhortations, whether of a clergyman or of any other person; or by a solemn promise of secrecy even confirmed by an oath; . ... \u00f3r by any deception practised on the prisoner, or'false representation made- to him for that purpose, provided there is no reason to suppose -that the inducement held' out was calculated to produce any untrue confession, which is the main point to-be considered\u2019 1 Greenleaf on Ev., par. 229.\nTurner\u2019s statements appear to be Those of a man whose narrative was based on first-hand knowledge and not on induced fabrication. What he stated fitted into all the.admitted facts. The glibness of his answers' revealed that he rather, enjoyed telling the story of a brutal-double murder and his part in it.. Anyone believing: Turner\u2019s -later' assertions that li\u00e9 had been coerced into making his ihcriminatin'g statements about the eommis-' sion of these murders-, would' be:too-credulous to be safely' entrusted with.tiny part in'the realistic whrk of'administering' the criminal law with-justice both to the accused and ;to society. \u2022\" \" \u2022 \u25a0 \u25a0 '\nIn cases of thi\u00e1 kind tli\u00e9 duty; \u00f3f'the' judiciary is th hold the balance true between''the' safety of\u2019society and fair play for an1,\u00e1cciised. ''Solicitude for the f\u00e9elings of an accused must not be permitted to blind either j udicial or police officers, to the rights of. the multitude .to have criminals apprehended and their, further depredations prevented.- Any method of extracting confessions by means which'would cause a prisoner to falsely confess guilt in order to\" be relieved of unendurable immediate suffering will not be tolerated in any civilized state, On the other hand,, for a court- to hold that- a: confession made by a well-fed. and decently cared' for prisoner after he lias been held-in custody a few days w'itlf\u00f3ut counsel or contact with friends and after lie has been questioned a few hours every day by police officers in,.reference to a crime of which he is suspected, is .inadmissible as being, a. coerced confession would be unrealistic and impracti-' cal. Such a judicial holding would result in a vast increase in the already too large number of felons who go unpunished and are free to prey upon law abiding citizens. These enemies of society naturally endeavor to commit their crimes where; there are no witnesses except themselves and their victims. When the victim is killed the murderer feels himself safe. Fortunately for society, criminals soon become possessed of an impulse to disclose their guilty secrets. This impulse is invigorated and vocalized by skillful interrogation. The facts just stated are well known to any person with any knowledge of human psychology or with any practical experience in the administration of criminal law. Criminals possessed of this desire to reveal their crime often lose that desire as soon as counsel or \u201cpals\u201d advise them to \u201ckeep their mouth shut\u201d. In the unending warfare between the criminal and society \u00e1 due regard for the latter\u2019s safety requires that officers, should have a reasonable time within which to interrogate an accused while he is in their custody and being fairly treated and without their efforts to elicit the truth being frustrated by persons interested-in saving criminals from the just consequences of their crimes. The test to be applied to confessions secured by police officers is this long established and judicially sanctioned one, to wit: \u201cWas the confession secured under such circumstances and by such methods as to make it testimonially trustworthy?\u201d Only when it is manifestly worthless as evidence should it be summarily rejected. Except in those cases where the confession is so obtained as to make its rejection the obvious duty of the trial judge, the jury acting under proper instructions is the tribunal to apply the above test.\nWigmore on Evidence, 3rd Edition, pages 318-319, section 851, pertinently says in justification of the interrogation of accus\u00e9d persons by officers of the law: \u201cMiscalling a thing by a bad name does not make it any worse than it is. Let us therefore ask whether there is any reason why . the traditional process-of lengthy continuous /interrogations--in .seclusion,, \u2022 immediately after arrest, calls -for. exclusion of a- confession thus 'made. \u25a0\nIn the first place, an,.innocent-person is always helped by an-.early-opportunity to tell his whole story; hundreds -of:-suspected:.persons every -day are'set free because .their-story thus told bears the marks Of truth: Moreover,\u25a0 and more important\u2019,--every guilty person is almost always ready and desirous-.to confess, as soon ns he- is. detected. and arrested.. .This psychological truth, well. known, to- all criminal- -trial -judges* seems to. be ignored by some,Supreme Courts;-.The nervous pressure of guilt is-enormous-; the load of.-the-deed done is heavy ; the. fear of- detection .fills the consciousness; and -when detection comes, the, pressure is relieved;-and- the deep sense, of relief, makes confession a satisfaction.. At that moment,--he will;-tell-all, and tell-it; truly; - To forbid soliciting him,, to seek to prevent: this relief,-is to.,fly in the face of, human-.nature. It is -natural,- and should-be lawful, ;to takes his confession at that moment \u2014 the best one..-And this expedient,-if, sanctioned-,-saves the State a delay and . expense in convicting him-after he has reacted from his first sensations, has yielded-to his-friends\u2019 solicitations, and comes under the sway of the-natural human instinct, .to- struggle' to-save himself by the aid of all technicalities.\n\u2018\u2018(\u25a02) In the case: of-professional- criminals,: who usually, work,in groups,, there-is. often-no hope of getting at the group .until-one .of them has \u2018peached\u2019, and given the clues to the police. The police know this, and have known it for generations in., every- country. -The only .ones who apparently, do -not know it are some of the Supreme Court judges. A thorough questioning of the first suspected- person who is caught makes possible the pursuit of\"the right'trail for the others. To forbid this is to.tie the. bands' of the p'olic\u00e9. The attitude: of some judges, towards these necessary, police methods is lamentable,; one would think that the police,, not the'criminals, were the enemies of society.- To disable the detective police, from the very- function they are set to fulfil -is no less than absurd. Let the judges who sit in, judgment on crime Took-a little into, the facts. Let them not sit up aloft and dictate-a. rule which ignores the well-known facts of criminal life and hampers the needful methods of justice.\u201d\nEven if it should be decided in \u00e1- given case that a .prisoner had been technically wrong'ed by an -officer\u2019s refusal to take him before a com'mitfting \u2022 magistrat\u00e9 almost immediately after his arrest for a felony, it does not follow that under the American constitutional system- society must be more grossly, wrong\u00e9d by having the. prisoner turned loose upon.it after: he has. confessed his guilt. Just as in morals \u201ctwo wrongs do, not make .a right\u201d, so in law .committing a: wrong, against , an accused cannot, be righted by committing a wrong against society, \u2022 ..\u2022 - .\nThis court has always protected: accused persons against convictions other than by due process of law. The \u201cdue process\u201d provision in the 14th Amendment to the Federal Constitution conferred on citizens.of this Commonwealth no rights in addition to .those, which they had for centuries enjoyed under state judicial protection. As the Supreme Court of the United States in Mobile & Ohio Railroad v. Tennessee, 153 U.S. 486, 506, said: \u201cThat [14thl amendment conferred no(new and additional rights, but only extended, the protection of the Federal Constitution over rights of .life, liberty, and property that previously existed under all state constitutions.\u201d In Interstate Railway Co. v. Massachusetts, 207 U.S. 79, 87, Justice Holmes speaking'for the United States Supreme Court said: \u201cThe traditions and habits of centuries were not intended to be overthrown when that [14th] Amendment whS passed.\u201d\nWe have no hesitation in declaring that the nse in the instant case of Turner\u2019s confession in no way breached his right to a trial by due process of law. Nor is there any merit in the contention that the joint confessions made by Turner and his accomplices were received in evidence against him. The mutually incriminating statements were made by each of the accused in the presence of all. Not only did Turner hear himself accused by those who at the same time confessed their own guilt but by signing their statements he verified them. On the authority of Commonwealth v. Oreszak, 328 Pa. 65, 195 Atl. 45, and Commonwealth v. Brooks, 355 Pa. 551, 50 A. 2d 325, all three statements were admissible. It was also admissible under the authority of Commonwealth v. Vallone, 347 Pa. 419 32 A. 2d 889, where this Court held that \u201cwhen a statement made in the presence and hearing of a person is incriminating in character and naturally calls for a denial but is not challenged or contradicted by the accused although he has opportunity and liberty to speak, the statement and the fact of his failure to deny it are admissible in evidence as an implied admission of the truth of the charges thus made.\u201d\nWhen Turner was taken to the scene of the homicides, and his two confederates, Johnson and Lofton, reenacted the murders of Simmons and Endres, in the commission of which crimes they assigned Turner the major role, he made no denial of their accusations but stood mute. His guilt of a brutal killing committed in the perpetration of robbery was proved beyond a reasonable doubt and in a fair trial. The jury fixed the only appropriate penalty, that of death.\nAll the assignments of error are overruled, the judgment is affirmed and the record is remitted to the court below so that the sentence duly imposed may be carried out.\nMr. Justice Jones concurs in the judgment.\nPennsylvania\u2019s equivalent of the \u201cdue process\u201d provision of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution is found in Article I, section 9, the last sentence of which reads as follows: \u201c. . . nor can he [the accused] be deprived of his life, liberty or property, unless by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.\u201d \u201cLaw of the land\u201d means due process of law: Norman v. Heist, 5 W. & S. 171, 40 Am. Dec. 493 (1843).\nThe Act of May 31, 1718, 1 Sm. L. 105, sec. 4, 19 PS 783, requires the courts to assign \u201clearned counsel\u201d to prisoners upon all trials of capital crimes. This is also required by the Act of March 22, 1907, P. L. 31, sec. 1, 19 PS 784, which also provides for compensation and expenses for such assigned counsel. This has never been interpreted to mean that counsel must be provided for persons accused of capital crimes as soon as those persons are taken into custody. See Com. ex rel. McGlinn v. Smith, 334 Pa. 41, 24 A. 2d 1.\nJustice Reed in his dissenting opinion said: \u201cNow the Court leaves undecided whether the present confessions are voluntary or involuntary and declares that the confessions must be excluded because in addition to questioning the petitioners, the arresting officers failed promptly to take them before a committing magistrate. The Court finds a basis for the declaration of this new rule of evidence in its supervisory authority over the administration of criminal justice. I question whether this offers to the trial courts and the peace officers a rule of admissibility as clear as the test of the voluntary character of the confession. I am opposed to broadening the possibilities. of defendants escaping punishment by these more rigorous technical requirements in the administration of justice. If these confessions are otherwise voluntary, civilized standards, in my opinion, are not advanced by setting aside these judgments because of acts of omission \u25a0which are not shown to have tended toward coercing the admission.\u201d\nTurner stated ,(in addition to what is already. quoted- in- this, opinion)\u2019 that \u201con Saturday, December 15, 1945\u201d be said to Johnson and Lofton, \u201cw\u00e9 have a job to\" do and they went with m\u00e9 . . . when we passed hi the-second door we met the man and I 'hit him-the man with a piece of iron which I- had wrapped up in a piece off newspaper. Q. When you- say you looked the place over, the broom factory . . -. what did you have in mind? A. I figured at was quiet around there and I figured it was; easy money to rob.\u201d He stated the size. of the weapon -he-used-and mentioned \u201cthe hole-in the end\u201d of-it.Jasper Johnson in-his confession, which Turner also signed, said that after .they got to the broom- factory, -f\u2018we were met by ;the smallest fellow, a middle aged man. Tree-top [Turner] slugged him on the side of- the head. The fellow was- on -the floor scuffling,- trying to'get up. I runs in his pocket pulls out a wallet out of the hip pocket. . . . I looks around to see Tre\u00e9-top and the other man. He was oil the floor and Tree was over him. He had don\u00e9 slugged him.\u201d Clarence Lofton, the other confederate, made a statement, which Turner alsb signed. Lofton, who was the \u201clookout\u201d/said that when' they came out of the place Fats or Tree-top said,- \u201cOne- of them wasn\u2019t no trouble at all'but one of the-sons \u2018ofbitches I-had to\u2019give a hell of a blow to.\u201d From Johnson\u2019s statement-the man who -thus boasted of the \u201chell bf a blow\u201d he gave one of the victims was Turner: - \u25a0\nIn the well-known case of Commonwealth of Mass. v. John Francis Knapp, 9 Mass. 496, for the murder of Captain Joseph White in 1830, the facts were that the Knapp brothers had for $1,000 hired one Crowninshield to bludgeon and stab to death Captain Joseph White, aged 82, so that Joseph Knapp could through Knapp\u2019s mother-in-law inherit (as he erroneously believed) a large portion of Captain White\u2019s estate. A little more than two months after the murder, Joseph J. Knapp, on the third day of his imprisonment, confessed his guilt and implicated Crowninshield, who later committed suicide in jail. At the trial of John If. Knapp, Joseph refused to testify for the Commonwealth. Both brothers were convicted and executed. Daniel Webster was special counsel for the Commonwealth. In his closing address for the Commonwealth, Webster, after vividly describing the midnight murder of the \u201caged victim\u201d and recounting the confidence of the assassin that his guilt would remain undiscovered, said: \u201cHe had done the murder. No eye has seen him, no ear has heard him. The secret is his own, and it is safe! Ah! Gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such a secret can be safe nowhere. . . . the guilty soul cannot keep its own secret. It is false to itself; or rather it feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to be true to itself. It labors under its guilty possession, and knows not what to do with it. The human heart was not made for the residence of such an inhabitant. It finds itself preyed on by a torment, which it dares not acknowledge to God or man. A vulture is devouring it, and it can ask no sympathy or assistance, either from heaven or from earth. The secret which the murderer possesses soon comes to possess him, and, like the evil spirits of which we read, it overcom\u00e9s him, and leads him whithersoever it will. He feels it beating at his heart, rising to his throat, and demanding disclosure. He thinks the whole world sees it in his face, reads it in his eyes, and hears its workings in the very silence of his thoughts. It has become his master. It betrays his discretion, it breaks down his courage, it conquers his prudence. When suspicions from without begin to embarrass him-, and the net of circumstances to entangle him, the fatal secret struggles with still greater violence t.o burst forth. It must be confessed, it will be confessed, there is no refuge from confession but suicide, and suicide is confession.\u201d\nIn the instant case Turner while in the cell room of City Hall, apparently shortly after his arrest, called \u201cacross the top of the cells to Jasper Johnson to stand tight and not to talk.\u201d He was then transferred to the station house at 15th and Snyder Avenue. He was later brought back to City Hall \u201cafter he had promised not to try to influence other prisoners.\u201d\n'\"After tliis sense of nervous relief lias p\u00e1ss\u00e9cl, the inclination to 'tell'disappears; arid m\u00f3st confessions'are in fact made within a short time after arrest.\u201d Footnote, page 319, Wigmore, supra."}
