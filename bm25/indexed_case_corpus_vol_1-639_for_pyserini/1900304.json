{"id": "1900304", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Chief Justice Bell,\nThis is an appeal by the Commonwealth as condemnor in an eminent domain proceeding from an Order of the Court of Common Pleas No. 6 of Philadelphia County. This Order dismissed the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cappeal from [the] Report of [the Board of] Viewers.\u201d The effect of the Order of the Court of Common Pleas was to dismiss the objections raised by the Commonwealth to one separate and specific item. of damages which had been awarded by the Board.\nOn March 26, 1962, the Pennsylvania Department of Highways condemned a portion of condemne\u00e9\u2019s property including part of its industrial plant* to obtain land for the construction of the Delaware Expressway in the City of Philadelphia. The' parties being unable to agree on damages, a board of viewers was appointed under the Eminent Domain Code of 1964, \u00a7504.\nHearings were held by the Board in October, 1964. Oh November 30, 1964, the Board filed a viewers\u2019 report. The Board, in its Report which awarded total d\u00e1m\u00e1ges, included therein (inter alia)' \u00e1 separate spe-' eifie and distinct item, viz., Relocation and Reinstallation Damages in the amount of $50,000.\nThe Commonwealth, on December 29, 1964, appealed to the Common Pleas Court as permitted by \u00a7515 of the new Eminent Domain Code, supra, and also demanded a jury trial. The Commonwealth sought, under \u00a7517 of the Code, a preliminary ruling before the jury trial that relocation and reinstallation expenses are absolutely non-compensable in eminent domain proceedings. The lower Court declined to rule the question preliminarily in favor of the Commonwealth, but, as evidenced by its opinion, held that the cost of removal and reinstallation are factors which may properly be considered in determining the \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d value where there has been a partial taking.\nSince this case arose in relevant part prior to the new Eminent Domain Code of June 22, 1964, supra, this holding was an accurate statement of the law. Dyer v. Commonwealth, 396 Pa. 524, 152 A. 2d 760; Hahn v. City of Bethlehem, 322 Pa. 129, 185 Atl. 227; Regina v. Monroe County, 319 Pa. 257, 179 Atl. 36; Westinghouse Air Brake Co. v. Pittsburgh, 316 Pa. 372, 176 Atl. 13.\nWe believe that both appellant and appellee now agree with this ruling, which we repeat we have herein affirmed. The real issue between the parties is therefore now moot. In Schuster v. Gilberton Coal Company, 412 Pa. 353, 194 A. 2d 346, the Court said (page 358) : \u201c\u2018It has long been the rule in Pennsylvania that this Court will not decide moot questions. We will do so only in rare instances where exceptional circumstances exist or where questions of great public importance are involved: Conti v. Department of Labor and Industry, 405 Pa. 309, 175 A. 2d 56 (1961). Ridley Park Shopping Center, Inc. v. Sun Ray Drug Co., 407 Pa. 230, 232, 180 A. 2d 1, 3 (1962).\u201d\n\u2022We note further that the trial in the Court of Common Pleas is de novo; moreover under \u00a7703(3) of the new Act and even prior thereto, the viewers\u2019 report is not admissible in evidence. Berger v. Public Parking Authority of Pittsburgh, 380 Pa. 19, 109 A. 2d 709.\nAppeal dismissed.\nMr. Justice Cohen concurs in the result.\nAct of June 22, 1964, P. L. 84, 26 P;S.' \u00a71-504. Although the condemnation occurred prior to the effective date of the Act, \u00a7302 provides that Articles V and VII shall be applied retroactively.\nIn light of our conclusion, we need not decide whether this appeal merely questioned \u201cthe amount\u201d of the award or the fact that the specific relocation item was non-compensable and whether the Order of the lower Court was (1) a confirmation, modification or change of the report of the Viewers or (2) a final Order under \u00a7517, and therefore appealable under \u00a7523."}
