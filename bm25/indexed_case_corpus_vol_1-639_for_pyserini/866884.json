{"id": "866884", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe questions involved in this case are clearly stated and correctly disposed of by the learned referee. We find nothing in the record that would justify us in sustaining any of the specifications of error; nor do we think that either of them requires special notice. The judgment of the court below, dismissing appellant\u2019s exceptions and confirming the finding of the referee in favor of plaintiff, is affirmed on the referee\u2019s report."}
