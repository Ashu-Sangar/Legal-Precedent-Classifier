{"id": "918680", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn this case the plaintiff moved for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, and a rule to show cause was granted. The motion for judgment was argued on December 21, 1899, and the rule to show cause was discharged. The learned court below in a clear and comprehensive opinion showed that the affidavit was sufficient to prevent judgment. In this conclusion we all concur.\nJudgment affirmed."}
