{"id": "3596583", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice FITZGERALD.\nWe determine whether the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law (UTPCPL), 73 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 201-1-209-6, applies to an attorney\u2019s conduct in collecting and distributing settlement proceeds. The Superior Court held that the UTPCPL provides a cause of action against attorneys arising out of the disbursement of settlement funds. We hold the UTPCPL does not apply to attorney misconduct, and reverse the decision of the Superior Court.\nFACTS\nThis case arises from the admitted conversion of funds by Donald Richmond, an associate of appellants\u2019 Pennsylvania law firm, Forceno & Arangio, P.C. (the Firm), for which the Firm was held vicariously liable, and for the preparation of a settlement distribution sheet by the Firm which included deductions for unsubstantiated costs.\nAppellee Janice Iannece Beyers and her companion, James Piccirilli, were injured in an automobile accident. They re-\ntained the services of Donald Richmond and the Firm to represent them in their personal injury claim. Appellee agreed to settle the ease for $468,401.67. According to a fee agreement, appellee was to receive 42.5% of the settlement, or $205,495.72. The Firm received the settlement funds and Richmond converted $185,000 of the settlement. Richmond deposited $95,000 of the funds into court in Delaware County in connection with his personal divorce action. The remaining funds, held in escrow by appellants, were also deposited into court. Appellants prepared a distribution schedule, which provided: $68,481.91 for recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees, $1,576.65 for unidentified costs, $6,480.59 for a \u201cloan repayment\u201d to an accountant, and $18,001.61 for medical bills. These amounts were deducted from appellee\u2019s settlement. The court ordered appellants to pay appellee $110,904.96, based upon the distribution schedule.\nAppellee contended that the deductions reflected on the distribution schedule were improper. On January 29, 2002, appellee filed a complaint against appellants alleging negligent supervision, negligence, conflict of interest and breach of fiduciary duty, violation of consumer protection laws (UTPCPL), assumpsit in the form of forfeiture of attorneys\u2019 fees, and fraudulent misrepresentation.\nA bench trial was held on the sole issue of damages. On August 25, 2008,. the court found in favor of appellee as to all claims, except violation of the UTPCPL. The claims pursuant to the UTPCPL were held under advisement. The court rendered a preliminary verdict, in the amount of $110,198.24, which represented the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount of $68,481.91 and non-existent costs totaling $26,058.85, plus simple interest at the statutory rate of 6% per annum during the 2% years of non-payment in the amount of $15,607.48.\nOn December 9, 2003, the Honorable Mark Bernstein found in favor of appellee on the UTPCPL claim, awarding her treble damages in the amount of $78,171.00. Appellee filed a motion for clarification of the December 9, 2003 order, contending that the entire verdict entered on August 25, 2003, $110,198.24, should be trebled. Appellee also requested 40% for attorneys\u2019 fees on the trebled amount. On February 6, 2004, the court assessed damages in the amount of $467,637.20 on the UTPCPL claim. Post trial motions were filed, denied, and judgment was entered.\nThe Superior Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court, and adopted its reasoning, holding that appellants\u2019 actions did not arise from the practice of law, and therefore appellants could not use their profession as a shield from the application of the UTPCPL. Further, the Superior Court held appellee established the essential elements of fraud, and that appellants\u2019 malfeasance pertaining to the collection and management of the settlement funds, as well as the breach of their fiduciary responsibility to appellee, placed their actions within the scope of the UTPCPL.\nDISCUSSION\nThis case presents a question of law, thus this Court\u2019s standard of review is plenary. Norton v. Glenn, 580 Pa. 212, 860 A.2d 48, 52 (2004). Although we find the egregious conduct of appellants in this case to be reprehensible, we decline to hold that Pennsylvania\u2019s UTPCPL applies to an attorney\u2019s conduct in collecting and distributing settlement proceeds. Application of the XJTPCPL under these circumstances would encroach upon this Court\u2019s exclusive power to regulate the practice of law in this Commonwealth. In re Larsen, 571 Pa. 457, 812 A.2d 640, 653 (Sp.Trib.2002).\na. Applicability of Consumer Protection Laws\nMost states have enacted a consumer protection statute. The majority of jurisdictions that have addressed this issue have held that the regulation of attorneys does not fall within the ambit of consumer protection laws. A minority of jurisdictions has carved out an exception for entrepreneurial aspects of the practice of law, such as advertising and debt collection, while recognizing that claims which allege negligence or legal malpractice are exempt from the consumer protection laws. Courts which strictly adhere to the separation of powers doctrine hold that consumer protection laws do not apply to attorneys. Other jurisdictions hold that the consumer protection statutes do not apply to the practice of law based upon the existence of regulatory boards, or explicit exemptions for attorneys within statutes. However, some jurisdictions have indicated implicitly that in certain circumstances a claim could be brought against an attorney under the consumer protection act, and still other jurisdictions have not decided the issue.\nb.- Pennsylvania\u2019s UTPCPL\nThe pertinent section of the Pennsylvania statute provides:\n(a) Any person who purchases or leases goods or services primarily for personal, family or household purposes and thereby suffers any ascertainable loss of money or property, real or personal, as a result of the use or employment by any person of a method, act or practice declared unlawful by section 8 of this act, may bring a private action to recover actual damages or one hundred dollars ($ 100), whichever is greater. The court may, in its discretion, award up to three times the actual damages sustained, but not less than one hundred dollars ($ 100), and may provide such additional relief as it deems necessary or proper. The court may award to the plaintiff, in addition to other relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable attorney fees.\n73 P.S. \u00a7 201-9.2(a).\nThe applicability of this statute to the attorneys\u2019 conduct in this case presents an issue of first impression in Pennsylvania. Although this Court has not addressed the issue of the applicability of the UTPCPL to attorney conduct, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania has held that the UTPCPL does not apply to treatment provided by another category of professionals: physicians. Foflygen v. R. Zemel, M.D., 420 Pa.Super. 18, 615 A.2d 1345 (1992), appeal denied, 535 Pa. 619, 629 A.2d 1380 (1993); Gatten v. Merzi, 397 Pa.Super. 148, 579 A.2d 974 (1990), appeal denied, 528 Pa. 611, 596 A.2d 157 (1991). In Gatten, the court held \u201c[t]here is no indication that the [UTPCPL] was intended to create a cause of action for every statement made by a physician regarding a patient\u2019s condition, the likelihood for success of a given procedure, or the recommended course of treatment.\u201d Gatten, 579 A.2d at 976. The holding in Gatten was embraced by the court in Foflygen. Foflygen, 615 A.2d at 1354.\nIn Walter v. Magee-Womens Hosp., 876 A.2d 400, 407 (Pa.Super.2005), aff'd per curiam,, 588 Pa. 739, 906 A.2d 1194 (2006), the Superior Court held that the UTPCPL was not intended to apply to providers of medical services. Walter involved a proposed class action lawsuit filed for a group of women whose pap smear reports were processed bearing physicians\u2019 names, although the reports were not reviewed by physicians. The proposed class was not certified and the appellate court determined, inter alia, that the processing of pap smear results did not trigger a claim under the UTPCPL. The Superior Court in Walter opined that \u201cPennsylvania courts have determined that the UTPCPL does not apply to providers of medical services.\u201d Walter, 876 A.2d at 407.\nAccording to the Act, unfair methods of competition and deceptive practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are unlawful. 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-3. The phrase \u201ctrade or commerce\u201d includes the sale of services. 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(3). Among the practices condemned by the Act are various misrepresentations as well as other fraudulent conduct that creates a likelihood of confusion or misunderstanding. 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(4). However, even though the Act does not exclude services performed by physicians, it is clear that the Act is intended to prohibit unlawful practices relating to trade or commerce and of the type associated with business enterprises. It equally is clear that the legislature did not intend the Act to apply to physicians rendering medical services.\nWalter, 876 A.2d at 407-8, (quoting Gatten, supra at 976).\nWe are also persuaded by the reasoning in an unpublished, non-precedential decision from the federal District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Jackson v. Ferrera, 2002 WL 32348328, 2002 U.S. Dist. Lexis 12731 (E.D.Pa.2002), where the District court addressed the applicability of the UTPCPL to attorney misconduct. In Jackson, an attorney was sued for violation of the UTPCPL. The court, noting that nearly all courts having considered the issue had rejected the notion that it applied to attorney conduct in the context of the practice of law, held that \u201c[o]n this basis alone, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim.\u201d Id at *2, 2002 U.S. Dist. Lexis 12731 at *4.\nBut in Daniels v. Baritz, 2003 WL 21027238, 2003 U.S. Dist. Lexis 7707 (E.D.Pa.2003), the District Court distinguished Jackson. In Daniels, the defendant attorneys were debt collectors within the meaning of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692, and the court held \u201c[attorneys who regularly engage in debt collection practices, apart form their legal representation, are covered under the FDCPA.\u201d Daniels, at *4, 2003 U.S. Dist. Lexis 7707 at *11-12 (emphasis supplied). The UTPCPL was interpreted to apply to debt collection as an act in trade or commerce. Id. at *5, 2003 U.S. Dist. Lexis 7707 at *14. Similarly, the Commonwealth Court addressed applicability of the UTPCPL in the context of physicians\u2019 fraudulent billing practices. In Commonwealth v. Cole, 709 A.2d 994, 997 (Pa.Commw.1998), appeal denied, 558 Pa. 611, 736 A.2d 606 (1999), the court held that a physician\u2019s attempt to collect outstanding bills from patients after the statute of limitations had run was violative of the UTPCPL. Dr. Cole characterized his activities as debt collection and he was engaged in debt collection practices in violation of 37 Pa.Code \u00a7\u00a7 303.3(3) and (18) (Debt Collection Regulations). These cases are distinguishable from the decisions involving professional misconduct by physicians\nc. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s Authority\n\u201cThe Supreme Court in this Commonwealth is empowered by the Pennsylvania Constitution to govern the conduct of attorneys practicing law within the Commonwealth.\u201d Lloyd v. Fishinger, 529 Pa. 513, 605 A.2d 1193, 1196 (1992). This exclusive power is granted to this Court by Article V, Section 10(c) of the Pennsylvania Constitution which provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he Supreme Court shall have the power to prescribe general rules governing practice, procedure and the conduct of all courts.... All laws shall be suspended to the extent that they are inconsistent with rules prescribed under these provisions.\u201d Any legislative enactment encroaching upon this Court\u2019s exclusive power to regulate attorney conduct would be unconstitutional. Lloyd, 605 A.2d at 1196. The legislature is precluded from \u201cexercising powers entrusted to the judiciary.\u201d Commonwealth v. Stern, 549 Pa. 505, 701 A.2d 568, 571 (1997) (citation omitted).\nMoreover, this Court\u2019s exclusive authority in this area is founded on the separation of powers of our Commonwealth\u2019s government. The separation of powers doctrine can be found in the constitutions of 1790, 1838, and 1873. Dawphin County Grand Jury Investigation Proceedings, 332 Pa. 342, 2 A.2d 804, 807 (1938). When the Pennsylvania Constitution was amended in 1968, the section which the court relied on for the separation of powers doctrine remained unchanged. Moreover, Article V \u00a7 10(a) and section 10(c) were added, giving this Court the exclusive constitutional authority to regulate the practice of law. In Commonwealth v. Sutley, 474 Pa. 256, 378 A.2d 780, 783 (1977), this Court opined that \u201c[a]ny encroachment upon the judicial power by the legislature is offensive to the fundamental scheme of our government.\u201d\nFurthermore, Article V \u00a7 10(c) of the Constitution has been held to include the power of \u201cthe continuous monitoring of the practice of law.\u201d Cantor v. Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, 353 F.Supp. 1307, 1316 n. 21 (E.D.Pa.1973), aff'd, 487 F.2d 1394 (3rd Cir.1973). \u201cThe Supreme Court has declared the meaning of Article V, Section 10(c) in its Rule of Disciplinary Enforcement No. 103.\u201d Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission Bar Ass\u2019n. v. Thornburgh, 62 Pa.Cmwlth. 88, 434 A.2d 1327, 1331 n. 6 (1981), aff'd, 498 Pa. 589, 450 A.2d 613 (1982). \u201cThe Supreme Court declares that it has inherent and exclusive power to supervise the conduct of attorneys who are its officers (which power is reasserted in Section 10(c) of Article V of the Constitution of Pennsylvania) and in furtherance thereof promulgates these rules which shall supersede all other court rules and statutes pertaining to disciplinary enforcement heretofore promulgated.\u201d Id. at 1331 (citing Pa. R.D.E. 103) (emphasis added). The authority granted to the judiciary in Article V \u00a7 10(c) is exclusive, not concurrent. Lloyd, 605 A.2d at 1195.\n\u201cPursuant to our constitutional authority, this Court adopted the Rules of Professional Conduct and the Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement, which govern the conduct and discipline of attorneys.\u201d Commonwealth v. Stern, 549 Pa. 505, 701 A.2d 568, 571 (1997). In Stern, this Court held a statute that criminalized the conduct of an attorney for compensating a non-lawyer for client referrals was unconstitutional as violative of the separation of powers doctrine. Stern, 701 A.2d at 573. Pursuant to Pa.R.D.E. 103, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court declares that it has inherent and exclusive power to supervise the conduct of attorneys who are its officers\u201d and this Court is vested with \u201cthe inherent and exclusive power to govern the conduct of those privileged to practice law in this Commonwealth.\u201d Wajert v. State Ethics Comm\u2019n, 491 Pa. 255, 420 A.2d 439, 442 (1980). The General Assembly has no authority under the Pennsylvania Constitution to regulate the conduct of lawyers in the practice of law. Thus, we conclude that any application of the UTPCPL to the facts of this case would purport to regulate the conduct of attorneys and would be an impermissible encroachment upon the power of this Court.\nWe hold Pennsylvania\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct and Rules of Disciplinary Enforcement exclusively address the conduct complained of in this case. Specifically, Pa.R.P.C. 1.5(c) provides that \u201c[u]pon conclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its determination.\u201d Pa.R.P.C. 1.15(b) provides that upon receiving funds or other property in which a client or third person has an interest, a lawyer shall promptly notify the client or third person. \u201cExcept as stated in this rule or otherwise permitted by law or by agreement with the client, a lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third person is entitled to receive and upon request by the client or third person, shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property.\u201d Pa.R.P.C. 8.4(b) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201ccommit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer\u2019s honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.\u201d Pa.R.P.C. 8.4(c) provides that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to \u201cengage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.\u201d\nIn addition, this Court promulgated Rule 1.15 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct, which governs attorneys\u2019 disposition of client funds, directs the safekeeping of a client\u2019s property and authorized the creation of the Interest on Lawyers\u2019 Trust Account Act. 62 P.S. \u00a7 4023. And Pa.R.D.E. 514 addresses the issue of reimbursable losses of money caused by the dishonest conduct of an attorney.\nThese Rules, promulgated by this Court, provide the exclusive remedy for the attorney misconduct in this case. We hold appellants\u2019 conduct in collecting and distributing settlement proceeds does not fall within the purview of the UTPCPL, but rather within this Court\u2019s exclusive regulatory powers. Although we are extremely disturbed by the conduct of the appellants in this case, we cannot permit the trial court\u2019s award in this case to stand. We reverse the order of the Superior Court.\nReversed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nJustice CASTILLE and Justice BALDWIN join the opinion.\nChief Justice CAPPY files a concurring opinion in which Justice BAER joins.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a dissenting opinion.\n. There appears to be a computation error in this calculation, but the error is of no consequence in the disposition of this case.\n. On May 22, 2002, a default judgment was entered against Richmond for failure to file an answer to the complaint. On February 4, 2003, appellee's motion for summaiy judgment was granted only as to the vicarious liability of appellants for the malfeasance of Richmond. Appellants do not dispute the fact that Richmond converted funds due appellee and that they are vicariously liable for damages resulting from Richmond's actions.\n. The total of these sums should be $110,148.24. This error is not relevant to the disposition of the case.\n. This figure represented the trebling of the non-existent costs, $26,058.85.\n. This figure represented the trebling of ihe entire judgment of $110,198.24, plus 40% of the trebled amount for attorney's fees, and $4,804.55 in court costs.\n.

The doctrine of separation of powers \u201chas been inherent in the structure of this Commonwealth\u2019s government since its inception. \u2018This separation appeared in Pennsylvania as early as 1776 in the Plan or form of government for the Commonwealth or State of Pennsylvania . .. [and has] continued in our constitutions of 1790, of 1838, and of 1873.\u2019 \u201d Sutley, 378 A.2d at 782 (citation omitted).\n. We are further persuaded by the reasoning of the Delaware Superior Court in Jamgochian v. Prousalis, 2000 WL 1610750, 2000 Del.Super. Lexis 373 (Del.Super.2000). The Delaware Superior Court in Jamgochian expressed its opinion regarding the inherent constitutional authority of the Delaware Supreme Court to regulate attorney conduct in that state. The court opined as follows:\nThe Supreme Court is granted the authority to regulate the court system for the efficient administration of justice, including the attorneys who practice before the bench. Constitution of the State of Delaware (1897), Art. IV, \u00a7 13; 10 Del. C. \u00a7 1906. Control of the Bar by the Court is an ancient vestige of our legal system, derived from the common law of England. This power to regulate admission to and discipline of the Bar is inherent in the highest court of this state, \u201cindependent of any statutory grant of authority.\u201d According to the Supreme Court, the provisions of 10 Del. C. \u00a7 1906 \"are nothing more than legislative recognition of the inherent powers of this Court.\u201d In deference to the long tradition and further recognition of the intrinsic powers of the Court, the legislature has not undertaken regulation of the Bar by statute.\nJamgochian, 2000 WL 1610750 at *4, 2000 Del.Super. Lexis at *11-12 (internal citations omitted) (footnote omitted). Inherent in the power of the Delaware Supreme Court is the power to regulate every aspect of the practice of law.\nPursuant to this authority, the Court has promulgated rules governing the admission and conduct of attorneys as well as providing for the sanctioning of lawyers in violation of these regulations.... Every aspect of a lawyer\u2019s practice is encompassed by these rules. Everything from admission procedures to responsibilities of an attorney leaving practice are regulated. Advertising, accounting of client funds, communication with clients, dealings with third parties, competence of the attorney, conflicts of interest, and the unauthorized practice of law are among the myriad subjects that these comprehensive rules contemplate. The penalty for attorney misconduct in violation of these rules may range from censure to fines to disbarment, subject to the recommendations of the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\nId. at *4, 2000 Del.Super. Lexis at *13-14 (footnote omitted).\n. Rule 514 provides as follows:\n(a) General Rule. For the purposes of this subchapter reimbursable losses consist of those losses of money, property or other things of value which meet all of the following requirements:\n(1) The loss was caused by the dishonest conduct of a covered attorney when acting:\n(i) as an attorney-at4aw;\n(ii) in a fiduciary capacity customary to the practice of law, such as administrator, executor, trustee of an express trust, guardian or conservator; or\n(iii) as an escrow agent or other fiduciary, having been designated as such by a client in the matter in which the loss arose or having been so selected as a result of a client-attorney relationship.\n(2) The loss was that of money, property or other things of value which came into the hands of the covered attorney by reason of having acted in the capacity described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision.\n(3) The loss, or the reimbursable portion thereof, was not covered by any insurance or by any fidelity or similar bond or fund, whether of the covered lawyer, or the claimant or otherwise.\n(4) The loss was not incurred by:\n(i) the spouse or other close relative, partner, associate, employer or employee of the covered attorney, or a business entity controlled by the covered attorney, or any entity controlled by any of the foregoing;\n(ii) an insurer, surety or bonding agency or company, or any entity controlled by any of the foregoing; or\n(iii) any government unit.\n(5) A payment from the fund, by way of subrogation or otherwise, will not benefit any entity specified in paragraph (4) of this subdivision.\n(b) Maximum Recovery. The maximum amount which may be disbursed from the fund to any one claimant with respect to the dishonest conduct of any one covered attorney shall be $ 75,000.\n. As a result of our disposition of this issue, we need not address the other issues raised by appellants."}
