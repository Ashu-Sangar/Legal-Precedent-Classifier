{"id": "440535", "contents": "The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered, November 7th \u00cd877,\nPer Curiam.\n\u2014 This case falls directly within the ruling in the case of Seely v. City of Pittsburgh, 1 Norris 360, that the per foot front rule of assessment is inapplicable to lands such as those along Hazelwood avenue.\nThe payment by Kaiser of the assessment of $906.93 was voluntary, the lien upon the premises, even if rightly assessed, having expired at the time of payment.\nOn both grounds the court below was right.\nJudgment affirmed."}
