{"id": "1032310", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, February 3d 1873, by\nMercur, J.\nThe first and second assignments of error are not sustained. The 3d, 4th, 5th and 6th will be considered together. They all relate to the ascertainment of the contract under which the merchandise in question was delivered to the defendants.\nThe plaintiffs gave evidence that Furniss & Co., of Indianapolis, desired to purchase goods of them upon a credit. Not being satisfied as to their solvency, plaintiffs made an arrangement with Mr. Welsh, agent for the Union Railroad & Transportation Company, before delivering the goods for transportation, by which the boxes should be marked \u201c[F] Indianapolis, Indiana, care of S. F. Gray, Agent,\u201d and should not be delivered to Furniss & Co. until further orders from plaintiffs. The boxes thus marked were delivered to the defendants. The plaintiffs claimed this to be the contract under which they delivered, and the defendants received, the goods.\nThe defendants gave evidence that when the drayman subsequently, upon the same day, delivered the goods to them, he brought and presented for their signature, a shippers\u2019 receipt, filled up by plaintiffs\u2019 shipping clerk, in which the boxes were described as marked \u201c [F] Indianapolis, Indiana. For J. Furniss & Co., care S. F. Gray, Agent.\u201d Upon the face of the receipt it declared they were \u201c to be carried and delivered upon the the terms and according to the agreement as specified on the back of this receipt.\u201d\nUpon the back of this receipt, inter alia, is printed, \u201cit is agreed and is part of the consideration of this contract,\n\u201c1. That all goods received for transportation shall be * * * distinctly marked with the name of the consignee, and the station where and to whom consigned.\u201d\nThat the defendants signed said receipt and returned it to the drayman, who took it back to the plaintiffs. This direction, as contained in the receipt, was substantially copied into the manifest which was sent on to Gray.\nIt appears that upon the arrival of the goods Gray delivered them to Furniss & Co., who soon after failed and the goods were lost to the plaintiffs.\nThe counsel for the defendants requested the court to charge the jury that the said shippers\u2019 receipt superseded the arrangement made with Mr. Welsh respecting the consignee of the goods. The court declined so to charge. In this was no error. We think, however, the court did err in saying to the jury that the contract depended entirely upon the verbal arrangement. The court thus withdrew wholly from the consideration of the jury the shippers\u2019 receipt which was executed after the verbal arrangement. The receipt, as well as the verbal arrangement ought to have been submitted to the jury to enable them to find from the whole evidence, what the true contract was.\nThe 7th assignment is not sustained. It assumes the receipt alone embodied the terms of the contract. Whether the agent was authorized to deliver the goods, depended not upon the receipt alone, but upon what the jury found the contract to be under the whole evidence as we have indicated.\nJudgment reversed, and a venire faeias. de novo awarded."}
