{"id": "834470", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis was an ejectment in the court below. The only speci- . fication of error is that the court imposed full costs, the defendants not having filed a disclaimer. The ruling of the court below is so clearly right, and the appeal itself of such a trifling nature, that we not only affirm the judgment, but also impose the penalty of $20 counsel fee, provided by the act of assembly for frivolous appeals."}
