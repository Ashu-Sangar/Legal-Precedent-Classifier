{"id": "1804593", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nTwo issues are presented for our consideration in this case. They are 1) whether a criminal defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation is violated by the admission into evidence of a co-conspirator\u2019s out-of-court declarations, where the prosecution fails to prove that the declarant is unavailable to testify at trial; and 2) whether a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to his parent\u2019s search of the parent\u2019s residence in which the defendant lives for a murder weapon belonging to that parent.\nAppellee, Ricky D. Pinkins, was one of six men charged with murder, robbery and conspiracy in connection with the armed robbery of the owner and patrons of Porreca\u2019s Restaurant & Bar in Sharon, Pennsylvania.\nOn January 9, 1982, at approximately 9:30 p.m., three men entered Porreca\u2019s Restaurant. One held a shotgun, another held a revolver, and the third acted as the bagman. Two men remained outside in the getaway vehicle. The men in the restaurant robbed the owner and the patrons, one of whom was beaten with the shotgun. As the restaurant owner surrendered his wallet, the perpetrator holding the revolver shot and killed him.\nAppellee was not one of the five men at the restaurant, but he was the supplier of the revolver and possibly, the shotgun. The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was that the five agreed at the Colony Bar to rob a place to get money and they needed weapons to carry out their plan. Appellee was called and they drove directly to his home. He was informed by Anthony Wells that a \u201cpiece\u201d was needed to get some money. Appellee by his own admission provided Wells with a loaded .32 caliber revolver. There was some testimony that appellee may also have supplied the shotgun used in the robbery. The five then drove to Porreca\u2019s Restaurant. Following the robbery, the five divided the money among themselves, and Wells expressly withheld a share for appellee. The next day, appellee\u2019s share and his revolver were returned to him.\nApproximately three weeks later, acting upon an informant\u2019s tip, police approached appellee\u2019s mother without a search warrant and prevailed upon her to search her son\u2019s bedroom for the murder weapon. Appellee\u2019s bedroom was located in his mother\u2019s home. The revolver, which belonged to appellee\u2019s mother, was located by her in appellee\u2019s jacket pocket in the closet of his bedroom. The furniture arrangement in appellee\u2019s bedroom made entry into the closet awkward. When appellee was confronted with the weapon, he made a statement to police in which he admitted giving the revolver to Anthony Wells.\nHenry Bruce and Albert Boatwright testified against appellee at his trial, and appellee\u2019s taped statement was played for the jury. Statements made by Anthony Wells were introduced at trial under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule. Following his conviction by a jury of murder of the second degree, robbery and criminal conspiracy, appellee moved for a new trial, alleging, among other matters, that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence the statements of Anthony Wells. . Appellee argued in support of this contention that 1) the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was violated by the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule; 2) Anthony Wells cannot be a co-conspirator in the legal sense in that Wells was acquitted of all charges at a prior trial; and 3) there was not sufficient independent evidence of a conspiracy to permit Wells\u2019 statements to be admitted into evidence. Appellee also alleged that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy as to the closet area of his bedroom and that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by his mother's search of this area, thereby requiring the suppression of the discovered murder weapon and his statement.\nThe trial court determined that all of appellee\u2019s assignments of error were without merit and denied appellee\u2019s motions for new trial and arrest of judgment. On June 2, 1983, appellee was sentenced to life imprisonment. A divided panel of the Superior Court vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded the case for a new trial, finding that the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation is violated when the hearsay statements of a co-conspirator are admitted into evidence without a showing that the declarant is unavailable. Commonwealth v. Pinkins, 343 Pa.Super. 44, 493 A.2d 1365 (1985). Superior Court based its decision upon its reading of Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980), and stated:\nBecause there is nothing in the record to indicate that the Commonwealth ever established that Wells could refuse to testify against [appellee], the Commonwealth failed to carry its burden of demonstrating the declarant\u2019s unavailability.\n343 Pa.Super. at 53, 493 A.2d at 1370.\nSuperior Court also considered appellee\u2019s claim regarding his expectation of privacy in his bedroom closet and determined that the weapon was properly seized and that the revolver and appellee\u2019s statement were properly admitted into evidence.\nWe granted the Commonwealth\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal, and we now reverse.\nThe trial court and Superior Court correctly determined that Wells\u2019 acquittal would not bar admission of his statements under the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule, in that the burden of proving the existence of a conspiracy differs for purposes of an evidentiary ruling from the burden of proving the existence of the crime of conspiracy. The Commonwealth is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of an offense charged for purposes of conviction. With respect to the introduction of evidence under the co-conspirator exception, however, the Commonwealth is only required to prove the existence of a conspiracy by a fair preponderance of the evidence. See Commonwealth v. Hirsch, 225 Pa.Super. 494, 311 A.2d 679 (1973). Thus, an acquittal on a conspiracy charge does not preclude the possibility that the Commonwealth can show, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that a conspiracy exists, as it did in this case.\nSuperior Court stated that there \u201cmay\u201d be sufficient independent evidence of appellee\u2019s complicity in the enterprise, but characterized such evidence as \u201ctenuous\u201d and thus impliedly found insufficient evidence to prove the existence of the conspiracy. Our review of the record, however, leads us to hold that there was substantial evidence of the conspiracy which was ably summarized by the trial court as follows:\n1. The five men at the Colony Bar agreed to rob a place and recognized the need for weapons. Wells then admittedly called [appellee].\n2. After the call, the co-conspirators went directly to [appellee\u2019s] home.\n3. [Appellee] had his \u201cpiece\u201d ready for Anthony Wells when Wells arrived. Wells spent from 5 to 10 minutes in the house and admittedly advised [appellee] that he wanted a piece to get some money.\n4. Wells came out of the house with a loaded pistol ... [appellee] had given him____ Although it was one of the coldest nights of the winter, [appellee] came out of the house, approached the car and spoke to the conspirators seated in it, all of whom he was friendly with. Wells got in the car and the five drove to Porreca\u2019s Bar and committed the murder/robbery.\n5. After the robbery, the five divided the money into shares and an extra share was held out.\n6. After the crime, Wells admittedly telephoned [appellee] and advised what had occurred. When told that Bruce had shot Mr. Porreca, [appellee] did not ask how or why Bruce was along or how he had gotten the gun.\n7. The next morning [appellee] received back the murder weapon and acknowledged to Bruce that he had received his share of the money. When Bruce asked if [appellee] had received \u201cthat money,\u201d [appellee] responded he had without further inquiry, obviously knowing the nature, source and purpose of the money involved.\n8. It was only after Detective White told Boatwright that he had a statement from [appellee] that Boatwright admitted his guilt.\nOpinion of the Court at 20-21 (May 31, 1983). Thus, there was sufficient evidence to prove the existence of the conspiracy by a preponderance of the evidence.\nAdditionally, Superior Court appeared to bolster its Confrontation Clause analysis with its findings regarding the independent evidence of a conspiracy and interpreted Ohio v. Roberts, supra, to hold that the Sixth Amendment requires proof of unavailability for the admission into evidence of a co-conspirator\u2019s out-of-court declarations. This interpretation is incorrect. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court specifically rejected an interpretation of Roberts that would require a showing of unavailability for the admission of any out-of-court statement. U.S. v. Inadi, 475 U.S. 387, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390 (1986). In Inadi, that Court addressed whether the Confrontation Clause requires that the prosecution establish unavailability as a condition to admission of the out-of-court statements of an unindicted nontestifying co-conspirator, when those statements otherwise satisfy the co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court held that the \u201cunavailability rule\u201d is not applicable to co-conspirators\u2019 out-of-court statements, and in support thereof stated:\nConspirators are likely to speak differently when talking to each other in furtherance of their illegal aims than when testifying on the witness stand. Even when the declarant takes the stand, his in-court testimony seldom will reproduce a significant portion of the evidentiary value of his statements during the course of the conspiracy.\nIn addition, the relative positions of the parties will have changed substantially between the time of the statements and the trial. The declarant and the defendant will have changed from partners in an illegal conspiracy to suspects or defendants in a criminal trial, each with information potentially damaging to the other. The declarant himself may be facing indictment or trial, in which case he has little incentive to aid the prosecution, and yet will be equally wary of coming to the aid of his former partners in crime. In that situation, it is extremely unlikely that in-court testimony will recapture the evidentiary significance of statements made when the conspiracy was operating in full force.\n106 S.Ct. at 1126-27.\nThat Court also determined that an \u201cunavailability rule\u201d would impose an unacceptably substantial and significant burden upon the entire criminal justice system stating:\nA constitutional rule requiring a determination of availability every time the prosecution seeks to introduce a co-conspirator\u2019s declaration automatically adds another avenue of appellate review in these complex cases. The co-conspirator rule apparently is the most frequently used exception to the hearsay rule. See 4 D. Louisell & C. Mueller, Federal Evidence \u00a7 427, p. 331 (1980).12 A rule that required each invocation of Rule 801(d)(2)(E) to be accompanied by a decision on the declarant\u2019s availability would impose a substantial burden on the entire criminal justice system.\nMoreover, an unavailability rule places a significant practical burden on the prosecution. In every case involving co-conspirator statements, the prosecution would be required to identify with specificity each declarant, locate those declarants, and then endeavor to ensure their continuing availability for trial. Where declarants are incarcerated there is the burden on prison officials and marshals of transporting them to and from the courthouse, as well as the increased risk of escape. For unincarcerated declarants the unavailability rule would require that during the sometimes lengthy period before trial the Government must endeavor to be aware of the whereabouts of the declarant or run the risk of a court determination that its efforts to produce the declarant did not satisfy the test of \u201cgood faith. \u201d See Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S., at 74-77, 100 S.Ct., at 2543-45; id., at 77-82, 100 S.Ct., at 2545-47 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting); see also United States v. Ordonez, 737 F.2d 793, 802 (CA9 1984).13\nAn unavailability rule would impose all of these burdens even if neither the prosecution nor the defense wished to examine the declarant at trial. Any marginal protection to the defendant by forcing the government to call as witnesses those co-conspirator declarants who are available, willing to testify, hostile to the defense and yet not already subpoenaed by the prosecution, when the defendant himself can call and cross-examine such declarants, cannot support an unavailability rule. We hold today that the Confrontation Clause does not embody such a rule.\n106 S.Ct. at 1128-29 (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added).\nAccordingly, the Commonwealth in the case before us was not required to show that appellee\u2019s co-conspirator was unavailable to testify, and thus, appellee\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him was not violated.\nWith regard to the second issue in this case, which issue was raised by appellee, i.e., whether a defendant has a reasonable expectation of privacy with regard to his parent\u2019s search of the parent\u2019s residence in which the defendant lives for a murder weapon belonging to that parent, the trial court and Superior Court exhaustively combed the record to determine whether the suppression court properly found that appellee did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his bedroom closet. Although \u201cno single factor\u201d is determinative of this issue, see Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 152, 99 S.Ct. 421, 435, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978), reh. den., 439 U.S. 1122, 99 S.Ct. 1035, 59 L.Ed.2d 83 (1979), we find that the trial court and Superior Court, in examining all the surrounding circumstances, properly affirmed the suppression court in that the murder weapon belonged to appellee\u2019s mother and she had a right to search for her property anywhere in her home. It is a basic tenet of property law that an owner of property in the possession of a bailee may follow his or her property wherever it may be found and reclaim it with or without the bailee\u2019s knowledge or consent. Appellee\u2019s mother was acting as a property owner when she searched for her revolver in her home. Appellee did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in any area in which his mother\u2019s revolver was located, with respect to a search by her for her property.\nTherefore, we reverse the order of Superior Court and reinstate the judgment of sentence imposed by the trial court.\nFLAHERTY, J., filed a concurring opinion in which NIX, C.J., and ZAPPALA, J., joined.\n. The Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution provides, in relevant part, as follows:\nIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has determined that \"the Sixth Amendment\u2019s right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him is ... a fundamental right and is made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1068, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965).\n. The others involved in the robbery were Henry Bruce (pleaded guilty to murder of the second degree, robbery and conspiracy); Albert Boatwright (pleaded guilty to murder of the third degree); Albert Phillips (pleaded guilty to murder of the third degree, robbery and criminal conspiracy); Eugene Grannison (convicted by a jury of murder of the second degree, robbery and criminal conspiracy); and Anthony Wells (acquitted of all charges by a jury).\n. This exception is based upon the fact that the conspirators, acting together, act as one. Thus,\n[I]f a person has conspired with one or more other persons to do an unlawful act, each represents the other with respect to the act to be accomplished and everything said or done by any of them in pursuance of the common purpose is admissible against all.\n1 Henry, Pennsylvania Evidence \u00a7 442 (1953).\n. The federal rule, like its counterpart in this state, provides that a statement is not hearsay if it is offered against a party and is \u201ca statement by a co-conspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E). Accord Commonwealth v. Dreibelbis, 493 Pa. 466, 475, 426 A.2d 1111, 1115 (1981) (co-conspirator \u201cexception allows statements by a co-conspirator to be admitted against an accused if the statements are made during the conspiracy, in furtherance thereof, and where there is in other evidence of the existence of a conspiracy.\u201d).\n. That the declarant in this case, Anthony Wells, was acquitted of all charges, is no guarantee that he would be inclined to assist the Commonwealth in its prosecution of appellee. We believe that the Irtadi opinion applies to all nontestifying co-conspirators and do not find that the U.S. Supreme Court left open the possibility of carving out an exception for acquitted co-conspirators."}
