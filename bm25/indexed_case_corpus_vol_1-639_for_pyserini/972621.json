{"id": "972621", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThe court below set aside the attachment execution, upon the payment of over-dne premiums and costs. We do not see any error in this. The only breach of the bond was the nonpayment of the premiums. This is all the plaintiff can at present collect upon it; and when they are paid, with the costs, he has no further cause of complaint.\nAffirmed."}
