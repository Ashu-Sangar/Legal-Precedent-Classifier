{"id": "1809847", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nReview was granted in this matter to consider the questions (1) whether the defense of entrapment is available in administrative, to wit license revocation proceedings, and, if so, (2) whether the defense is available to the appellee in this case. Appellee, R.A. Smith, is a jockey whose license was suspended by appellant, the State Horse Racing Commission, on charges that he conspired to fix the outcome of a horse race.\nThe salient facts, as set forth in the Commission\u2019s adjudication, are as follows. Early in 1984, Smith met another jockey, one Vergara, who was unknowingly acting as an agent of investigators from the Attorney General\u2019s office. Vergara was participating in a scheme to entice other jockeys to agree to fix a race at some time in the future. In return for his agreement, each jockey received $500. Vergara received $100 per jockey for every jockey he enlisted.\nVergara asked Smith whether he would be interested in \u201cdoing business,\u201d and, on February 24, 1984, the two men went to a store in the vicinity of the Penn National Race Course to make a phone call in furtherance of this \u201cbusiness.\u201d Upon arriving at the store, Vergara spotted the agents from the Attorney General\u2019s office. Vergara advised Smith that the agents were \u201cbad people\u201d and that Smith could \u201chelp him out\u201d if Smith joined Vergara in the agents\u2019 car and went along with whatever these bad people were proposing. Smith did so. He entered the car, talked about the plans to fix races, and accepted $500 in cash. Once out of the car, Smith and Vergara went to a bar where Smith attempted to give Vergara the $500. Vergara convinced Smith to keep the money saying that Smith had \u201chelped him out of a tight spot\u201d and that Smith might not ever be called concerning a race.\nSmith\u2019s license was revoked, on grounds his \u201cexperience, character or general fitness ... is such that [his] participation ... in horse racing or related activities would be inconsistent with the public interest, convenience or necessity or with the best interests of racing.\u201d 4 P.S. \u00a7 325.213, 58 PA. Code \u00a7 163.58. On appeal to the Commission from the initial revocation decision, Smith raised the defense of entrapment. The Commission rejected the defense, on the grounds that entrapment is only available as a defense to a criminal prosecution. Commonwealth Court reversed, 92 Pa.Cmwlth. 472, 501 A.2d 303.\nIn 1972, the General Assembly defined entrapment; the definition is contained in the Crimes Code, Act of Dec. 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, eff. June 6, 1973, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq. That enactment provides, in relevant part, as follows: 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 313. With certain exceptions not here pertinent, entrapment, as defined in \u00a7 313, is applicable in all proceedings charging offenses against the Commonwealth, whether or not those proceedings arise out of Title 18.\n\u00a7 313. Entrapment\n(a) General rule. \u2014 A public law enforcement official or a person acting in cooperation with such an official perpetrates an entrapment if for the purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of an offense, he induces or encourages another person to engage in conduct constituting such offense by ...\n(2) employing methods of persuasion or inducement which create a substantial risk that such an offense will be committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it.\n(b) Burden of proof.\u2014 ... [A] person prosecuted for an offense shall be acquitted if he proves by a preponderance of evidence that his conduct occurred in response to an entrapment.\nSection 107(a) of the Crimes Code provides: \u201cThe provisions of Part I of this title [18] (relating to preliminary provisions) are applicable to offenses defined by this title or by any other statute.\u201d Although the term \u201coffense\u201d is not specifically defined in the Crimes Code, the term generally connotes a crime or misdemeanor \u2014 a breach of the criminal laws. Commonwealth v. Brown, 264 Pa. 85, 90, 107 A. 676 (1919) (overruled sub silentio in Commonwealth v. Harris, 351 Pa. 325, 336 n. 5, 41 A.2d 688, 694 n. 5 (1945) on unrelated issue of whether response to a question can constitute res gestae); BLACK\u2019S LAW DICTIONARY 1232 (4th Ed.1951). Thus, the defense of entrapment as codified is available only in the context of a criminal prosecution. This does not end our inquiry, however, for the question of what remains of the common law defense, and whether that defense ought to be available in administrative actions to revoke licenses yet remains.\nThe defense of entrapment is a relatively recent development in the law. Its recognition in Pennsylvania case law predates \u00a7 313, which is apparently the first codification of the defense in this Commonwealth, by many years. See, Commonwealth v. Wasson, 42 Pa.Super. 38, 57, (1910). The defense was spawned when \u201cupon grounds of public policy the courts ... refused to sustain convictions because of the abhorrent methods adopted to lure the accused into crime.\u201d Id. at 57. Thus, prior to the enactment of \u00a7 313, the defense was available \u201cwhen a law enforcement officer, by employing methods of persuasion or inducement which create[d] a substantial risk that persons not otherwise ready to commit the criminal act w[ould] do so, actually induce[d] such a person to commit the act. The rule require^], before the defence bec[a]me available, (1) a defendant not disposed to commit the crime, and also (2) police conduct likely to entrap the innocently disposed.\u201d Commonwealth v. Conway, 196 Pa.Super. 97, 103-104, 173 A.2d 776 (1961).\nAlthough the entrapment defense was developed in the context of prosecutions for violations of the criminal law, it has been raised in administrative proceedings as well. See, e.g. 4-6 Club v. Pa. L.C.B., 442 Pa. 154, 275 A.2d 40 (1971), In re Hoffco Corp., 198 Pa.Super. 1, 180 A.2d 270 (1962); Appeal of Italian Citizens Nat. Ass\u2019n. of America, 178 Pa.Super. 213, 115 A.2d 881 (1955); see also Annotation, Entrapment as a Defense in Proceedings to Revoke or Suspend License to Practice Law or Medicine, 61 A.L.R.3d 357 (1975. In each of the cases cited, the defense was rejected on grounds the conduct of law enforcement personnel did not sink to the level of entrapment. In none of these cases, however, was the question of its applicability per se in administrative proceedings discussed. Rather, for the sake of the discussion, availability of the defense was assumed.\nIn the criminal law, the defense of entrapment rests on the policy that the Commonwealth cannot tolerate having its own officials, who are charged with the duty of enforcing the law, instigating crime, at times by means which are themselves criminal, by implanting in minds not predisposed to commit crime criminal ideas, and thus effecting crimes which would otherwise never have been committed. This policy is laudable. Because instances may arise in the administrative setting, where, in order to prompt otherwise innocent licensees to violate laws and thereby lose their licenses, officials employ investigative techniques which are so egregious as to shock men of good conscience, we will not announce a rule which would preclude a tribunal so disposed from frustrating the intent of the overreaching officials by preserving the status of the licensee. Query, however, whether a licensee should avoid a revocation where the basis for that revocation is not a specific violation of an applicable statute or regulation but general fitness to hold the license as reflected in his or her behavior as is the case here.\nSmith\u2019s license was revoked, not because he violated any specific legislative or regulatory provision, but because his \u201ccharacter or general fitness ... is such that [his] participation ... in horse racing ... would be inconsistent with the public interest, ... or with the best interests of racing.\u201d 4 P.S. \u00a7 325.213(f)(2); 58 PA. Code \u00a7 163.58. This fact is made out not because he succumbed to his friend\u2019s entreaties to appear to go along with the \u201cfixing\u201d of races for the sake of the friend, but because in so doing he compromised both his own integrity and that of the industry. He voluntarily pursued a course of conduct which was calculated to make at least some members of the public believe that the outcome of races is the product of influences beyond the talent, ability and good fortune of the participants. This activity erodes the public confidence in the industry, and thus frustrates the legislative purpose requiring licensing.\nIn sum, while we recognize that instances may arise where a defense like \u201centrapment\u201d may be properly afforded in the administrative context, we do not view the matter before us as such a case. Thus, the order of Commonwealth Court is reversed.\nIn addition to the question addressed herein, Smith challenged the oral communication intercept procedures employed by the office of the Attorney General and the Commission. This issue was not addressed by the court below. Thus, the record is remanded to the Commonwealth Court for consideration of this issue.\nReversed and remanded.\nLARSEN, J., concurs in the result.\nZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nCommentators fix its earliest acceptance as a defense during the late nineteenth century, Ranney, The Entrapment Defense \u2014 What Hath the Model Penal Code Wrought?, 16 Duquesne L.Rev. 157 (1977-78)."}
