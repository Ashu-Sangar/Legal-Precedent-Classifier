{"id": "880511", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe questions involved in this case were fully considered and correctly decided by the court below. Nothing can be profitably added to what has been said by the learned judge in his clear, concise and satisfactory opinion, sent up with the record. On it we affirm the decree and dismiss the appeal with costs to be paid by the appellant."}
