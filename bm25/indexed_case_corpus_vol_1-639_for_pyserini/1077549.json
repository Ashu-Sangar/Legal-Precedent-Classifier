{"id": "1077549", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nDefendants appeal from a judgment of the court below awarding a peremptory mandamus against them, and plaintiff moves to quash the appeal upon the ground that, \u201csince the judgment in the case,\u201d defendants have fully complied with the order of that' court, and hence, quoad this appeal, the questions raised have become academic. Appellants\u2019 answer does not dispute the fact of compliance, but alleges the appeal should not be quashed, because to do so might thereafter \u201csubject [them] to the charge of violating the command of the court,\u201d as appearing in the peremptory writ. This, however, cannot be so. When a litigant obtains an order of the court, based on a fact averred by him, he is forever estopped, while the order remains in effect, from asserting, as against his adversary, anything differing from the fact so averred: Edwards\u2019 App., 105 Pa. 103; Garber v. Doersom, 117 Pa. 162; Donnelly v. Public Service Commission, 268 Pa. 345, 350. It follows that the general rule applies and the appeal should be quashed: Winston v. Ladner, 264 Pa. 548.\nAppeal quashed."}
