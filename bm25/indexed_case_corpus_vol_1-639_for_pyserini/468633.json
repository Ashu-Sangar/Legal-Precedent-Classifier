{"id": "468633", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Chief Justice.\nThis appeal requires us to construe the language of section 307(7) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 562, which permits termination of a widow\u2019s death benefits upon remarriage or for living in a meretricious relationship, and mandates payment of a widow\u2019s dower upon remarriage. The workmen\u2019s compensation judge, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB), and the Commonwealth Court all held that appellant\u2019s meretricious relationship justified termination of her widow\u2019s death benefits and that no widow\u2019s dower was due upon her subsequent remarriage. Appellant claims entitlement to the widow\u2019s dower based on an interpretation of the statute which differs from that of the lower tribunals.\nAppellant, Doris Reichert Todd (Mrs. Todd), was widowed in 1985 when her husband Harold Reichert died in the employment of National Cash Register Corporation (NCR). She received widow\u2019s benefits for a period of time from the company. In March, 1993, NCR filed a petition to terminate Mrs. Todd\u2019s benefits due to a meretricious relationship. Mrs. Todd filed an answer which requested a lump sum distribution of benefits (widow\u2019s dower) due to her remarriage on February 3, 1993. A hearing was held at which appellant testified that she began living with Mr. Todd in February, 1991, and that the two married in February, 1993.\nThe workmen\u2019s compensation judge issued an order terminating appellant\u2019s benefits and denying widow\u2019s dower. The WCAB affirmed the judge\u2019s order, and the Commonwealth Court affirmed the order of the WCAB. We allowed this appeal to review the Commonwealth Court\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute in question.\nSection 307(7) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 562, states, in relevant part:\nShould any dependent of a deceased employe die or remarry, or should the widower become capable of self-support, the right of such dependent or widower to compensation under this section shall cease except that if a widow remarries, she shall receive one hundred four weeks compensation at a rate computed in accordance with clause 2 of section 307 in a lump sum after which compensation shall cease: Provided, however, That if, upon investigation and hearing, it shall be ascertained that the widow or widower is living with a man or woman, as the case may be, in meretricious relationship and not married, or the widow living a life of prostitution, the board may order the termination of compensation payable to such widow or widower.\n(Emphasis added.) The lower tribunals all regarded the fact that for a period of time appellant lived with her flane\u00e9 in a meretricious relationship justified the termination of benefits, and held that once terminated, appellant\u2019s subsequent right to widow\u2019s dower upon remarriage was also extinguished. Thus, appellant was not entitled to the one hundred four week lump sum payment due upon remarriage.\nAppellant argues that such a reading of the statute is unreasonable. Her argument is that the statute creates several conditions which must exist to terminate benefits in this context. First, there must be an investigation and hearing. Then there must be a determination that, at the time of the hearing, the widow lives with a man in meretricious relationship and is not married. Appellant regards the use of the present tense (\u201cis living\u201d) and the conjunction (\u201cin meretricious relationship and not married\u201d) as significant, understanding the language to require both the meretricious relationship and the unmarried state to exist at the time of the hearing. She argues that the legislative intent appears to contemplate that, in some instances, an earlier meretricious relationship would have resulted in marriage prior to hearing, in which case it would be improper to withhold the widow\u2019s dower.\nA careful interpretation of the statute requires that we give effect to the present tense and conjunction emphasized in the following quotation. \u201c[I]f, upon investigation and hearing, it shall be ascertained that the widow or widower is living with a man or woman, as the case may be, in meretricious relationship and not married, ... the board may order the termination of compensation____\u201d We cannot, however, accept appellant\u2019s argument that the only relevant time is the time of hearing. It would be all too easy for a widow or widower to abandon a meretricious relationship temporarily for the date of a hearing and reenter the relationship immediately after the hearing. We cannot presume that the legislature intended such an absurd result. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1).\nOn the other hand, we cannot ignore the use of the present tense. The legislature plainly did not authorize termination of compensation due to a meretricious relationship on some indefinite past occasion. It appears that the only reasonable construction of the language is this: if, upon investigation, a meretricious relationship is discovered, the contemporaneous filing of a petition to terminate compensation alleging a present meretricious relationship satisfies the legislative intent; if, upon hearing, it is proved that a meretricious relationship existed on the date of filing, the board may order the termination of compensation. The date of filing is the critical date because it is the date it is alleged that a meretricious relationship presently exists \u2014 that the widow or widower is living in meretricious relationship. The date of hearing, on the other hand, is entirely fortuitous and is totally outside the control of the employer or workers\u2019 compensation insurer. In addition to alleging a present meretricious relationship, a petition to terminate must also allege that the widow or widower is, at the time of filing, not married.\nNeither condition is satisfied in this case. The record establishes that appellant was engaged to be married and lived with her fianc\u00e9 for a period of time while intending to marry. Due to a variety of circumstances, the marriage was delayed until February 3, 1993. The employer filed its request for a hearing subsequent to the marriage, in March, 1993. There was thus no meretricious relationship at the time of the filing, nor was appellant \u201cnot married\u201d at the time of filing. Termination on the ground of meretricious relationship was therefore improper.\nIt follows that when appellant remarried in February, 1993, prior to the employer\u2019s petition to terminate, she was entitled to the statutory widow\u2019s dower consisting of a lump sum payment of one hundred four weeks compensation, after which compensation ceases.\nThe judgment of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the case is remanded to the workers\u2019 compensation judge for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nNEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion."}
