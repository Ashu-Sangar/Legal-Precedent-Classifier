{"id": "817415", "contents": "Opinion,\nMe. Justice Mitchell :\nThe testator wrote, \u201c and the residue,.....if any, of the said one undivided seventh,.....given and devised, in trust, for my said daughter Ann M. Holmes, to grant, etc., to my children J. F., P. A., A. H., R. P., M. P., and E. C., and the children and grandchildren of my deceased daughter, M. N., equally, share and share alike, as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants, and the issue of any of my said, children who may then be dead,\u201d etc. Whom did the words \u201csaid children\u201d include? Appellant claims as one of the issue (grandson) of Ann M. Holmes, and his counsel has argued with great ingenuity that, as Ann Holmes was a child of the testator, and is mentioned in the. former part of the sentence, she must be.included among the \u201csaid children\u201d whose issue were to inherit. If she had been mentioned generally as a child, or among his other children, or in connection with his enumeration of his intended beneficiaries, the argument would be unanswerable. But the manner and connection in which she is mentioned make such a construction impossible. Her name appears solely as a part of the description of the fund of which he is disposing, and not at all as part of the disposition itself, or among the beneficiaries. The residue of the fund therein-before left in trust for Ann is the subject matter of the devise, and he describes it accordingly as the fund \u201c given and devised in trust for my said daughter Ann.\u201d But, if it had been described as \u201c the residue of the fund given and devised to the Safe Deposit Company in trust under the first part of this clause of my will,\u201d it would have expressed the testator\u2019s meaning with equal exactness, without mentioning Ann\u2019s name at all, and, of course, without any possibility of a claim that her issue were included in the subsequent enumeration of the beneficiaries.\nThis consideration settles the fact that in naming his daughter Ann the testator was not writing or thinking of her at all as a beneficiary, but of the fund which he identified by reference to her. When he came to the distribution he specifically named the children whom he intended should receive it, and, when he desired to provide for the contingency of the death of any of them, his primary beneficiaries, he added the words, \u201cissue of any of my said children who may then be dead.\u201d In the connection and manner of their use it is entirely clear that the words \u201csaid children\u201d referred to those he had named as distributees, and did not include Ann, whose name he used merely as part of the description of the fund to be distributed.\nThe learned court below were clearly right in their interpretation of testator\u2019s language.\nDecree affirmed."}
