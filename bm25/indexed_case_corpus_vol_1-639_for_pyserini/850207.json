{"id": "850207", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Green,\nIt cannot be doubted that the testator intended to dispose of the whole of his estate. The first clause of his will is as follows, \u201c I order that all my just debts and funeral expenses, also charges for probating this my will be first fully paid and satisfied and after the payment of the same I direct that the whole of my estate remaining shall be divided as follows.\u201d The testator then makes bequests of personalty, and thereafter devises of real estate, preceded by these words: \u201c After which I direct my real estate to be divided as follows.\u201d Then follow six devises of specific real estate, which, it is asserted by the appellants, and is not denied by the appellees, comprise the whole of the real estate of the testator. It is manifest, therefore, that the testator was perfectly conscious of the distinction between personal and real estate as subjects of testamentary disposition, and that he fully intended to dispose, by his will in question, both of all his personal estate and all his real estate.\nThe present contention arises upon the meaning of one of the clauses disposing of his personal- estate. It is in the following words: \u201c First. I give and bequeath to my brother Andrew Reimer any and all of my household goods, books, clothing, furniture, etc., that he may desire. The balance of the personal effects to be divided among the children of my sister, Mary Ewing.\u201d It is too plain for argument that this was an absolute bequest to Andrew of all the chattels named, because he was at liberty to take all of them if he so desired. If he so desired and took them all, there would be none left for the children of Mary Ewing to take, and the bequest to them would be nugatory for want of a subject-matter upon which to operate, if the contention of the appellees is correct. The controversy is upon the distribution of a considerable balance of personal estate which consisted of money and securities. The learned court below decided, and the appellees contend, that the children of Mary Ewing could only take the \u201c balance,\u201d if there was any, of the class of chattels given to Andrew, and could take no part of the money and securities. If this is correct, it follows that if Andrew took all the chattels of the class named Mary\u2019s children would get no part of the personal estate under the will. And it follows, also, that in order to produce this result it must be held that the testator died intestate as to all of his personal estate, other than the chattels mentioned in the bequest to Andrew. It is also alleged without contradiction that the testator\u2019s personal estate, according to the inventory, amounted to 123,796.54, of which the household goods, books, clothing and furniture were appraised at 1258.50, all of which went to Andrew Eeimer under the first clause of the will. The remainder consisted of cash and securities, and as to this the court below held that the testator died intestate, and made distribution of the whole of the balance to the next of kin. The fund was claimed by the children of Mary Ewing under the bequest to them of \u201c the balance of the personal effects,\u201d in the first clause of the will.\nIt is a perfectly well established rule in the construction of wills in Pennsylvania, that no testator is presumed to die intestate as to any part of his property, if the words of the will will carry the whole. In the case of the Appeal of the Boards of Missions, 91 Pa. 507, Mr. Justice Gordon, after reviewing the provisions of the will in question, said: \u201c From all this it would appear that the testator did not intend to die intestate as to any portion of his property, real or personal, and this intention must govern, unless there is something in the devise itself which forces us to a different conclusion; for it is a rule long and well settled that a will must be so construed as to avoid a partial intestacy unless the contrary be unavoidable.\u201d Applying this doctrine to the facts of that case, this court held that the residuary clause of that will, which directed the executors to sell all the rest and residue of his estate and pay the proceeds to a certain legatee, included money which had accrued as dividends on bank stocks and was not a subject of sale. In the case of Hofius v. Hofius, 92 Pa. 305, it was said by Mr. Justice Trunkey, delivering the opinion of the court: \u201c The learned judge of the common pleas truly said, \u2018 It should not be and never is presumed that a testator intended to die intestate of any portion of his estate, if a contrary intention can be fairly deduced from the language of his will.\u2019 And he might have added, \u2018 no presumption of an intent to die intestate as to any part of the estate, is to be made when the words of the testator will carry the whole,\u2019 Raudenbach\u2019s Appeal, 6 Nor. 51.\u201d It was held that a residuary clause which directed that the residue of the estate should be put out at interest by the executors with ample security, and the interest thereof should be paid to the widow during her life, and should be equally divided after her death between two of the testator\u2019s children, embraced a tract of forty acres of land which was not otherwise disposed of.\nIn Jacobs\u2019 Estate, 140 Pa. 268, it was held that a residuary clause in the following words, \u201c The remainder and residue of my money I give and bequeath to the hospital of the Protestant Episcopal Church in Philadelphia,\u201d carried certain real estate with it to the residuary legatee, not otherwise disposed of. The decision was put upon the ground that the testatrix did not intend to die intestate, and that she did not intend her heirs to have any part of her estate.\nIn Sweitzer\u2019s Estate, 142 Pa. 541, we held that a bequest in the following words, \u201c The rest, or nine tenths of my available stocks I bequeath to my sister Charlotte during her lifetime, after her death to be divided equally between the children of my brother,\u201d carried with it cash, notes, shares of corporate stocks, United States four per cent bonds and corporate bonds or loans of a navigation company. This result was reached by the application of the same rule we are considering, and the various securities above mentioned, not having been otherwise disposed of, and the testatrix having said, \u201c I believe it my duty to dispose of my whole estate, ... I therefore make this my last will,\u201d etc., we decided that the clause of the will above mentioned should be construed as a residuary clause in favor of the legatee named therein.\nThese illustrations of the rule might be infinitely multiplied, but the foregoing are sufficient, and it is only necessary to examine briefly the language of the will to make the application.\nThe decision of the court below turned chiefly upon the meaning of the word \u201c effects,\u201d in the first clause. The learned judge held that the whole right of the children of Mary Ewing was to take the remainder of the specific chattels which Andrew Reimer did not take. Apart from the consideration that this ruling would produce an unintended intestacy as to the great bulk of the estate of the testator, it is clear from the authorities that the word \u201c effects \u201d has a much larger signification than was accorded to it. Thus in 2 Williams on Executors, p. 1015, it is thus stated: \u201c The word \u2018 goods \u2019 is nomen generalissimum and when construed in the abstract will comprehend all the personal estate of the testator, as stock, bonds, notes, money, plate, furniture, etc. And a bequest of all the testator\u2019s \u2018 chattels \u2019 will have the same effect as a bequest of all his \u2018goods and chattels.\u2019 So the word \u2018effects,\u2019standing alone, will pass the whole of the testator\u2019s residuary estate,\u201d citing a number of cases. Of course this meaning may be restricted by residuary words, but in their absence they have the enlarged significance stated.\nIn Hogan v. Jackson, 1 Cowper, 299, Lord Mansfield said': \u201cI take \u2018effects\u2019 to be synonymous to \u2018worldly substance,\u2019 which means whatever can be turned to value, and therefore that real and personal effects mean all a man\u2019s property.\u201d To this reference may be added Campbell v. Prescott, 15 Ves. Jr. 500a, in which it was held that the word \u201c effects\u201d in a will was equivalent to \u201c property \u201d or \u201c worldly substance.\u201d In our own case of Dowdel v. Hamm, 2 Watts, 61, Rogers, J., said: \u201c The term \u2018 goods and chattels \u2019 includes choses in action as well as those in possession : 12 Co. 1; 1 Atk. 182. The term \u2018 chattels \u2019 is more comprehensive than \u2018 goods,\u2019 and will include animate as well as inanimate property ; and so of the term \u2018 effects ; \u2019 for the term \u2018 goods \u2019 will not embrace fixtures, but the term \u2018 effects \u2019 may. 7 Taunt. 188 ; 4 J. B. Moore, 78 ; 4 B. & A. 206. The term \u2018 effects, both real and personal,\u2019 in a will passes freehold estate, and all chattels real and personal: 2 Chitty\u2019s Black, in the note. Toller, in his Law of Executors, uses the term \u2018 effects \u2019 as including choses in action. . . . And we come to the same result if we adopt the popular signification of the term. It means such funds in the hands of the executor as may be made effective or available for payment of debts or legacies.\u201d\nRecurring to the language of the will in the present case we fail to discover any words restrictive of the general meaning of the word \u201c effects.\u201d The bequest is \u201c The balance of the personal effects to be divided among the children of my sister Mary Ewing.\u201d The court below said that this meant the balance of the specific chattels bequeathed to Andrew Reimer which he did not desire. By what authority is such an inference drawn? The will does not say so. It gives Andrew the right to take all of those specific articles, and, assuming that Andrew would take all that he was entitled to take, which is but ordinary human nature, there would be no balance for Mary\u2019s children to take. If the testator had meant to restrict their right to only that kind of goods, or chattels or effects, he would have so provided that there should be such a balance. But on the contrary he so provides that the children can get none of those effects except what Andrew chooses to give them, and then their title would be not under the will, but under-Andrew. Such a construction leads to the absurd result that the will has no meaning at all in that view, because Andrew could give them a portion of the effects with or without the will.\nBut, independently of this consideration, the plain meaning of the words, just as they stand, does not invite or permit any restricted meaning to the bequest. The first sentence of the first clause simply gives to Andrew certain specific chattels and then stops, thus: \u201cI give and bequeath to my brother, Andrew Reimer, any and all of my household goods, books, clothing, furniture, etc., that he may desire.\u201d This is a simple gift of all the articles mentioned. If Andrew does not desire some of them, those not taken be'come a part of the residuary personal estate of the testator and will pass by any residuary bequest. Then in immediate connection with the first sentence of the clause the testator provides thus: \u201c The balance of the personal effects to be divided among the children of my sister, Mary Ewing.\u201d Whose \u201cpersonal effects?\u201d Obviously the testator\u2019s. What are his personal effects ? Necessarily everything embraced within the description \u201c personal property.\u201d This is the language of all the authorities in all cases where the natural meaning of the word \u201c effects \u201d is not restricted by the context, and here there is no such restriction. \u201c The balance of the personal effects \u201d of the testator means all of his personal effects, except such particular personal effects of a designated class as may have been taken by Andrew under the first sentence of the first clause of the will. To us this meaning seems perfectly simple. It is in entire accord with the authorities, it effectuates the plain intent of the testator, and it prevents him from dying intestate as to a large part of his estate the whole of which he has expressly declared his intention to dispose of. We are clearly of opinion that the second sentence of the first clause of the will is residuary in its character and was intended as such by the testator, and that the fund for distribution should be given to the children of Mary Ewing. There is nothing in the provision for the monument which in the least degree conflicts with this view. Of course it was to be paid for out of any moneys in the hands of the executors.\nThere is not the slightest merit in the third assignment relating to the payment of attorney\u2019s fees for defending the will. It has been decided over and over again that the costs, including counsel fees, for the trial of issues devisavit vel non cannot be charged to the estate unless it is benefited thereby: Koppenhafer v. Isaacs, 7 Watts, 170; Mumper\u2019s Appeal, 3 W. & S. 441; Scott\u2019s Estate, 9 W. & S. 98 ; Yerkes\u2019s Appeal, 99 Pa. 401.\n.But if this were not so we cannot discover that any such question was raised in the court below. The very brief appendix that is published does not show that any such question was raised. The opinion of the court makes no allusion to it, and there is no credit claimed by the accountant for any such payment.\nThe decree of the orphans\u2019 court is reversed at the cost of the appellees, and the record is remitted with instructions to make distribution of the fund in accordance with this opinion."}
