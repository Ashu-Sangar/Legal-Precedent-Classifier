{"id": "3467185", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 22nd day of June, 2006, the Order of the Court of Judicial Discipline is AFFIRMED on the basis of the finding of a violation of Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 18(d)(1) (authorizing suspension, removal from office, or other discipline for, inter alia, \u201cconduct which ... brings the judicial office into disrepute, whether or not the conduct occurred while acting in a judicial capacity or is prohibited by law.\u201d). However, the court\u2019s conclusion that Appellant\u2019s conduct violated Rule 2A of the Rules Governing Standards of Conduct of Magisterial District Judges was improper, because that conduct did not implicate the judicial decision-making process. See In re Cicchetti, 560 Pa. 183, 743 A.2d 431 (2000). Accordingly, that finding, which was not essential to the decision or order below, is disapproved."}
