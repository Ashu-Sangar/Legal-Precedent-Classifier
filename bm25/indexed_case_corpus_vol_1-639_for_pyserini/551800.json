{"id": "551800", "contents": "Mr. Justice Paxson\ndelivered the opinion of the court January 3d, 1887.\nThis rvas a contest between a mechanics\u2019 lien creditor, and the execution creditors of H. S. Hancock. The said Hancock Avas the lessee of certain premises in the city of Pittsburgh. Whilst in the possession of the demised premises, which consisted of a two-story brick building used as a saloon, he made certain alterations and repairs thereto. This lien was filed against all the interest of Hancock, as lessee, for the sum of $1,327.50, being for the balance due the contractor for said repairs. The single question presented by this record is whether said lien for repairs is valid and binding upon the interest of .the lessee. If it is, it must be by virtue of an Act of Assembly giving such lien by its express terms or by necessary implication. We cannot give such liens by judicial construction.\nIt Av-as contended, in the first place, that the lien may be sustained under the Act of April 1st, 1873, P. L., 473, which is as follows: \u201c That all the provisions of the several Acts of\nAssembly, and the suplements thereto, giving a lien to parties doing Avork or furnishing materials for or about the erection or construction of buildings in the county of Allegheny, are hereby extended to leaseholds in said county: \"Provided, that the lien hereby given shall only extend to the interest of the lessee or tenant in such leasehold.\u201d\nIt will be noticed that'this Act extends to leaseholds, the provisions of the several Acts of Assembly giving a lien for work done or materials furnished for or about the \u201cErection and construction of buildings.\u201d It was repeatedly held that under the Act of 1836 a lien would not lie for repairs and alterations, unless as was subsequently held in Dresbach v. Keller, 2 Penn. St. R., 77, and in Armstrong v. Ware, 20 Id., 519, \u201cthe structure of a building is so completely changed that, in common-parlance, it may be properly called a new building, or a re-building.\u201d It was contended however that the Act of 1836 must be so extended as to include repairs and alterations, by reason of the Act of May 1st, 1861, P. L., 550, the important part of which is as follows: \u201c The said Act, entitled \u2018 An Act relating to liens of mechanics and others upon buildings, approved the 16th day of June, 1836, together with the several suplements thereto,\u2019 shall hereafter be taken to apply to debts contracted for work done'or materials furnished for or about the repair, alteration of or addition to any houses or other buildings so that liens may hereafter be had for the payment of all debts contracted for work done or materials furnished for or about the repair, alteration or addition of any house or other building under the aforesaid Act,\u201d etc. This Act originally did not apply to Allegheny county, but was extended to that county by the Act of 16th of February, 1865, P. L., 150, in the following language: \u201c The supplement to the Act of 16th of June, 1836, relating to the liens of mechanics and others upon buildings, approved the 1st day of May, 1861, be, and the same is hereby extended to the county of Allegheny; provided that nothing in the Act shall render property liable for repairs, alterations or additions where the same has been altered by any lessee or tenant without the written consent of the owner or owners, or reputed owner or owners, or his or her authorized agents.\u201d \u00bb\nIt wa.s contended that the Act of 1861 was explanatory of the Act of 1836, and that thereafter the \u201cerection and construction \u201d shall be held to include \u201c alterations or repairs,\u201d and that inasmuch as the Act of 1873 uses the words \u201c erection or construction,\u201d we must assume it was intended to include \u201calterations or repairs.\u201d We are of opinion, however, that the Act of 1861 was amendatory, not explanatory; that it was intended to give a lien where none existed before, that is to say to cases where there was a \u201crepair, alteration or addition to any houses or other buildings.\u201d It did not destroy the distinction between \u201cerection and construction\u201d and \u201calterations or repairs.\u201d This clearly appears from the cases of Rynd v. Bakewell, 87 Penn. St. R., 460, and Wetmore\u2019s Appeal, 91 Id., 276, where it was ruled that a mechanic\u2019s claim for the erection and construction of a building could not be sustained .by proof of repairs.\nWe are of opinion that the Act of 1873, extending the Act of 1836 and its supplements to leaseholds in Allegheny county, applies only to the erection and construction of a building and not to its repair or alteration.\nThe arghmeut that such lien was given by the Act of 1865, extending the Act of 1861 to Allegheny county is not sound. It is true the proviso, of said Act declares, as we have seen, that property shall not be liable for repairs or alterations made by the lessee \u201c without the written consent of the owner or owners, or reputed owner or owners, or his or her authorized agents,\u201d and it was contended that this gave a lien upon the leasehold by necessary implication. We do not so regard it. The object of the proviso was not to give a lien upon the leasehold, but to prevent the estate of the owner being bound unless by his oilier consent in writing.\nIf there is any Act of Assembly which gives a mechanic\u2019s lien upon this leasehold it has not been, pointed out to us.\nThe decree is reversed at the cost of the appellee, and distribution ordered in accordance with this opinion."}
