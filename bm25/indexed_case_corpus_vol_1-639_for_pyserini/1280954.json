{"id": "1280954", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Boic,\nThe question before us is whether or not there was \u00e1 substitution of one insurance policy for another.\nThere was an effort to issue group health and accident insurance to the Pennsylvania Realtors Association, but they were held by the Attorney General not to be professional persons and the policies were therefore issued to them individually.\nPlaintiff\u2019s husband received his policy in 1948 and by successive renewals maintained it until March 31, 1954. This policy contained a thirty-one days\u2019 grace period and required sixty days\u2019 notice to terminate it. There was no provision against suicide. Harty killed himself on April 28, 1954: the question of his mental illness was submitted to the jury at trial, and they found him insane. This is not now in issue.\nThe dispute before us arises out of another policy for which the decedent paid, on April 5, 1954, a larger premium. Plaintiff admitted that a new policy was. issued to her husband, effective April 1, 1954, and it. is agreed that no termination notice was given under the first policy and that the second policy, unlike the. first, had a suicide clause.\nThere is no doubt that the second policy was differ-, ent. Its' issuance was preceded by correspondence. The Company had had unfavorable loss experience under the first policy and issued a letter asking the holders of those policies to complete a form, which was enclosed, and return it if they wished \u201cto malee a change in . . . present coverage.\u201d The deceased did not do this. The Company also sent out a brochure saying that a new application must be completed and returned: he made none. His insurance agency wrote him that unless they heard from him they would assume that he wished \u201cto continue . . . present coverage under the revised form policy . . .\u201d He did nothing but pay the increased premium, which apparently was the result of receiving a bill. There is evidence that he was not informed that the new policy contained a suicide clause.\nThe insured\u2019s beneficiary sued to recover under the first policy and has the jury\u2019s verdict.\nDefendant\u2019s motion for a new trial depends upon the trial judge\u2019s statement in his charge that the policy, prepared by the Company, should be construed strictly against it and in favor of the insured. Defendant argues that since the. dispositive point is whether or not there was a substitution of one policy for another, there was no part of the policy requiring construction, and that the effect of the instruction might be to tilt the jurors\u2019 minds if they were on dead center.\nThe trouble is set at rest by the following part of the charge: \u201cNow that is if you have any question about the terms and phrases of the policy. You may have no question about it; you can say, well it is clear; there is no doubt as to what it means, but if there is a doubt, then you construe the policy as I have charged you.\u201d\nDefendant\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. depends upon the idea of a substitution. This is an affirmative defense: Clingerman v. Everett Cash Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 124 Pa. Superior Ct. 89 (1936); Schock v. Penn Township Mutual Fire Insurance Association, 148 Pa. Superior Ct. 81 (1942). In Moser Manufacturing Co. v. Donegal Insurance Company, 362 Pa. 110 (1949), this Court said: \u201cWhere,.as here, cancellation-is relied upon as an affirmative defense, the burden is, on the defendant to prove an effective cancellation of the policy prior- to the loss.\u201d '\nThe insurer must -show strict compliance with the cancellation provisions: Leban v. Pottstown P. Ry. Co., 279 Pa. 381 (1924). In Pomerantz v. Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 279 Pa. 497 (1924), this Court said: \u201cThe insurer, to be relieved of liability, must literally comply with the requirements of this (cancellation) clause; otherwise the policy will continue aud the com-' pany will be bound for any loss occurring thereunder.\u201d\nThe case of Scheel v. German-American Insurance Co., 228 Pa. 44 (1910) is very much in point. The necessary facts appear in the opinion: \u201cIf the insurance company allege as a defense in an action on its policy that the assured has waived the five days\u2019 notice, or that he-has replaced the policy by another policy and thereby relieved the company from liability, it is incumbent upon the company to aver in its affidavit of defense and prove on the trial, not only that such was- the intention of the assured but that his intention was carried out with his consent and- by his agreement, with the company. In other words, the mere procurement of- another policy on the same property and for the same amount after the notice and within the five-day limit does not disclose an intention on the part of the assured to cancel the earlier policy or to relieve the company from liability thereon; and in order that it may have such effect, the company must aver and prove that the assured consented and agreed to the cancellation and the substitution of the later for the earlier policy, . ... As the defense rests solely-upon the allegation that the policy was cancelled by the substitution of the Hartford company policy for a like sum, the defendant must aver and show, not only that the assured intended to, but did procure from the Hartford Company a policy, substitute it for the defendant\u2019s policy, and consent or agree that the substituted policy should take the place of the defendant\u2019s policy . . .\u201d\nThe Scheel case distinguishes Arnfeld & Son v. Guardian Assurance Co., 172 Pa. 605 (1896), on which appellant relies. The point of distinction is that in the Arnfeld case the substitution of the new policy was by express agreement between all of the parties, whereas in the Scheel case, as in the instant case, the intention of the plaintiff must be proved. The trial judge left the decedent\u2019s intention to the jury, and their verdict supplies the answer. It could not be declared as a matter of law.\nThe same idea refutes defendant\u2019s argument for novation, express or implied, and distinguishes the cases that it cites. One of the four requisites of a novation listed in Kritz v. Axler, 134 Pa. Superior Ct. 120 (1939) is \u201cthe extinguishment of the old contract.\u201d In Taylor v. Stanley Co. of America, 305 Pa. 546 (1932) agreement to substitute a new contract was established by the facts. Cancellation was also by mutual agreement in Miller v. Travelers Insurance Co., 143 Pa. Superior Ct. 270 (1941).\nAppellant may not predicate the decedent\u2019s consent to a substitution upon his payment of the premium alone. Harty\u2019s intention depended upon all of the circumstances: Taylor v. Stanley Co. of America, supra (305 Pa. 546 (1932)). . Aside from the contents of the correspondence and brochure mentioned above, defendant\u2019s agent admitted that Harty was not told about the changes in the new policy that were detrimental to him, although the change was, the witness felt, a small one.\nIt does not lie well in defendant\u2019s mouth to deny that its first policy was in force until May 1st. It sent no sixty-day cancellation. It spoke of \u201cchange in present coverage\u201d. It required an application form, which later apparently it waived. It offered decedent the option to continue his old policy at an increase in premium. And in its brochure, under the title \u201cOutstanding Features\u201d, there appears the statement: \u201cPays in addition to any other insurance.\u201d It is by no means impossible that when he paid the larger premium the decedent thought that he was continuing his policy with the same weekly, hospital, and surgical benefits at an increased premium in accordance with the correspondence. It was peculiarly for the jury to say what was in the gathering dusk of the decedent\u2019s mind.\nDefendant suggests that a grace period does not contemplate free insurance, citing Miller v. Travelers Insurance Co., supra (143 Pa. Superior Ct. 270 (1941)). The cited case involves a very different situation, one of group insurance where the contracting parties were held to be the employer and the insurer and the individual beneficiaries had merely a certificate. The opinion says: \u201cit is not within the power of the beneficiary to keep a group contract of insurance in force or to abrogate it.\u201d Hence the free insurance referred to relates to the period of grace remaining after the employer and insurer had cancelled the prime policy.\nThe instant case has its close counterpart in Ozanich v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 119 Pa. Superior Ct. 52 (1935) where the question was whether or not the decedent was in his employer\u2019s service on the date of his death. He had been laid off in the middle of the month and it was held to be for the jury to say whether the employment continued. The Court, by Judge Keller, said: \u201cThe premium on Ozanich\u2019s insurance was paid for the month of December, 1932. If he died within the grace period of thirty-one days, \u25a0following January 1, 1933, his beneficiary would still be- entitled to be paid.\u201d,\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
