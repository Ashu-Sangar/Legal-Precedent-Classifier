{"id": "1001548", "contents": "Opini\u00f3n'BV\nMr. Justice Brown,\nJoseph Carlisle, at the time' of his death \u2014 September 17, 1898 \u2014 waa the owner of the farm involved in this amicable action of ejectment. The present title to it depends upon the proper Construction of the following clause in his will: \u201cThird. I give and devise to my son Newton Carlisle, the farm he now lives on, for and during his life, to use and occupy as his own, and if he should have children living at his death, then I devise the same to them, but if he should die without issue as' aforesaid, then I devise the same to my said grandson Joseph Edgar Carlisle.\u201d Newton Carlisle, who never had any children, died July 17, 1912, leaving a will, by which he gave his entire estate to his wife, Ella J. Car-lisle, one of the appellees. More than two years before his death he had executed a deed for an undivided third interest in the farm to J. M. Dickson, one of the defendants in this action brought by Joseph Edgar Carlisle, claiming title' as the devisee of his grandfather.\nIn determining whether Joseph Carlisle gave an estate in fe\u00e9-tail to his son Newton, which became a fee-Simple under the Act of 1855, our first inquiry is, What Wgs tie testator\u2019s intention? It could not have been moire clearly expressed that the son\u2019s estate was to be limited to his life, with a devise over to his \u201cchildren living at his death.\u201d If nothing followed these words, it could uot be questioned that the word \u201cchildren\u201d should be given its primary meaning, and that children of the son Newton living at the time of his death would have taken as purchasers by devise directly from their grandfather. But it is contended that, in view of the words immediately following \u2014 \u201cbut if he should die without issue as aforesaid\u201d \u2014 the testator intended to Use the word \u201cchildren\u201d in the sense of issue or heirs of. the body, and that the devise to the son, therefore, became a feersimple under the Act of 1855 and the \u00bfpplication of the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case. This contention was sustained by the court below, the learned president judge who Spoke'for it being of opinion that when the testator used, the word \u201cissue\u201d he intended to define the meaning to be given to the preceding word \u201cchildren.\u201d In this we are unable to concur. On the contrary, we are clear that the testator intended the word \u201cissue\u201d to mean \u201cchildren living\u201d at the time of his son\u2019s death. The words are not \u201cif he should die without issue,\u201d but \u201cif he should die without issue aforesaid.\u201d The \u201cissue aforesaid\u201d are \u201cchildren living\u201d at the time of the son\u2019s death, and the unmistakable intention of the testator in using the words \u201cissue as aforesaid\u201d was to .again refer to those children. No other intention can be imputed to him, and the words \u201cissue as aforesaid\u201d must be construed as meaning the children to whom the testator referred qnd as, therefore, importing a definite failure of issue. \u201cMr. Jarman, in his valuable treatise on wills, after referring to a number of authorities establishing the settled rule of construction to be th\u00e1t the words \u2018in. default of such issue,\u2019 following an express devise to any particular branch of issue, as children, sons or daughters, will be construed to refer to the issue before described, adds: \u2018It is well settled also that words importing a failure of issue (without the word such), following a devise to children in fee-simple or fee-tail-, refer .to the objects of that prior devise and not to issue at large:\u2019 2 Jarman 372.. The cases to which he refers fully support Ms position\u201d: Sharswood, J., in Daley v. Koons, 90 Pa. 246. Among other of our own cases announcing the same rule there may be cited Sheets\u2019 Est., 52 Pa. 257, and Chambers v. Union Trust Company, 235 Pa. 610.\nThe devise of the farm was to the son Newton for life, with remainder to his children, if he should leave any living, not, however, to them by devolution or descent from him, but by devise directly from the testator; and if the son should leave no living children, the devise of the remainder was directly from the testator to his grandson Joseph Edgar. The fee is in him: Kemp v. Reinhard, 228 Pa. 143.\nThe assignments of error are sustained, the judgment is reversed and is here entered for the plaintiff below."}
