{"id": "1206908", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nThe question in numbers 73 and 74 is what testatrix intended by the words \u201csuch child\u201d as used in paragraph (6) of the residuary article of her will. She was survived by two sons, Lloyd GL Reed and Charles M. Reed. She gave the residue in trust to pay, out of income, $8,000 per annum \u201cto my son, Lloyd GL Reed\u201d for life, and, if sufficient, to pay $8,000 per annum \u201cto my son, Charles M. Reed\u201d for life, and to divide the rest of the income, if in excess of $16,000, \u201cbetween my said sons\u201d for life; on the death of Lloyd, to pay his share of the income \u201cto his children\u201d until the youngest reached 21, then to pay that portion of the corpus producing Lloyd\u2019s ineoine \u201cto his said children.\u201d Clauses (5) and (6) then provide:\n\u201c(5) From and after the death of my son, Charles M. Reed, I direct.that the income to which he shall be entitled under this, my will, for and during his natural life, to the extent of Two thousand ($2,000.00) dollars shall .be paid ov\u00e9r by my said trustees equally to my two gr\u00e1ndsons Harrison Reed and Carl M. Reed, [sons of Charles M. Reed] for and during the term of their natural lives, and that all of' said income to which the said Charles M. Reed shall be entitled for and during Ms lifetime, in excess of said two thousand dollars, shall be paid over to my grandson Carl M. Reed, for and during his natural life.\n\u25a0 \u201c(6) And when any such grandchild shall die, then the principal of the fund producing said income to which such deceased grandchild was entitled, when living, shall be paid, assigned and conveyed by my said Trustees to such person or persons as such child by his last will and testament may appoint^ or in the absence of such appointment then to the heir or heirs at law of such child; but in case my said son,\u2019 Charles M. Reed, shall die, leaving no child or grandchild surviving Mm, then and in that case, I direct that the income to which the said Charles M. Reed is entitled during Ms life, shall be paid to my son, Lloyd G. Reed, if he shall survive the said Charles M. Reed, for and during his life, and from and after the death of the said Lloyd G. Reed, the said income shall be paid in equal shares to any child or children which the, said Lloyd G. Reed may leave surviving him in the same manner as . hereinbefore provided and. directed in relation to the share of my estate to which the said Lloyd G. Reed is entitled to, the .income.\u201d .\nIt will be noted that the words \u201csuch child\u201d appear in the fifth line and again in the eighth line of paragraph (6). Appellants contend that by \u201csuch child\u201d testatrix meant her son Charles M. Reed, to whom she had referred by name in paragraph (5) and to whom she also refers several times later in .paragraph (6) as \u201cmy said son,\u201d or as \u201csaid Charles M. Reed.\u201d Appellees contend that she meant one or both of her named grandchildren, sons of Charles M. Reed, a conclusion adopted by the learned court.\nWhen testatrix used the expression \u201csuch child,\u201d whose child did she mean, her own, or Charles M. Reed\u2019s?, It is of course time that .the words \u201cchild\u201d and \u201cgrandchild\u201d have not the same primary meaning and will not be construed as referring: to the same person unless the intention is clear (Horwitz v. Norris, 49 Pa. 213; Harrison\u2019s Estate, 18 Pa. Superior Ct: 588) but these authorities are of no assistance in this case.\nAfter creating the life estates for her sons, Lloyd and Charles, she reached the point, in disposing of her property, where she considered it necessary to provide for her son\u2019s children, and in paragraph (5) she provided for them. He left two children, Harrison and Carl, whom she had described in paragraph (5)', by name, as h\u00e9r two grandsons, and, it may be noted, she made a larger provision for Carl than for Harrison. Having provided that her son\u2019s life estate should be followed by life estates for his children, she next provided what should be done with her property on the death of a grandson. This she did in paragraph (6) which she began without repeating their names and ref\u00e9rred to them by the descriptive term \u201cany such grandchild,\u201d creating, in each, a power to appoint the share of the principal of which he had received the income; instead Of repeating the phrase \u201cany such grandchild\u201d to describe the donee of the power, she shortened it into \u201csuch child\u201d which again is a phrase descriptive of the person to whom she intended to refer. The grandsons mentioned in paragraph (5) were not to receive income until after the death of her son Charles; the power of appointment created in the first part of paragraph (6) could only be executed by \u201cany such grandchild\u201d if the child survived its father, and for that reason, in creating the power, she provided that \u201cin the absence of such appointment,\u201d that is, by any such grandchild, then the property should pass \u201cto the heir or heirs at law of such child,\u201d undoubtedly intending to refer' to either or both grandsons previously named. This interpretation finds further support in the next provision in paragraph (6) which deals with the contingency of the death of \u201cmy said son, Charles M. Reed, . . . leaving no child or grandchild surviving him.\u201d\n\u2022 It is unnecessary to- discuss possible meanings of the word \u201csuch\u201d or to consider the suggestion that it was intended to be synonymous with \u201csaid,\u201d an incorrect use of the word. We have no doubt whatever that it was used in the sense given in the dictionaries as meaning \u201cof that kind; of the like kind . . that is, such child \u2014 a child of the kind immediately referred to\u2014 \u201cany such grandchild,\u201d and that the donee of the power was intended to be one of the grandchildren to whom she had given a life estate. She never referred to her son, Charles M. .Reed, as \u201cchild\u201d or \u201csuch child\u201d or even \u201csuch son\u201d anywhere in the residuary article. When she referred to her own children, Lloyd or Charles, she used expressions such as \u201cmy son, Lloyd G. Reed,\u201d \u201cmy sonocharles M. Reed\u201d; several times she used the expression \u201csaid Charles M. Reed.\u201d To refer \u201csuch child\u201d in paragraph (6) to Charles M. Reed in paragraph (5), as appellants contend, would in effect change the words \u201csuch child\u201d into the words \u201csaid son,\u201d because in paragraph (5) she referred not to both her sons but only to one of them, Charles; such a substitution the court may hot make.\nAt number 94 another question is presented. The testatrix, Harriet W, Reed, died in 1901. .Her son, Charles, died in 1917. Her grandson, Carl, died in 1940, leaving a will executing the power of appointment created in the 6th paragraph of the residuary article. He left a-will in which he created a trust of the residue of his. own property and also of that over which, he had the power, to appoint under his grandmother\u2019s will; \u201cI direct my said trustees to pay, for and during the lifetime of my wife, Lena W. Reed, the income- of said trust estate ... as follows, to wit: Fifty per cent (50%) thereof to my wife, Lena W. Reed; thirty per cent (30%) thereof to my son, Charles M. Reed; and twenty per cent (20%) thereof to my daughter, Virginia Ransom (formerly Virginia Hardwick) ; said payments of income to be made quarterly-annually to each of said beneficiaries. If either my said son or my daughter, dr both, shall pre-decease my wife, then I direct that the share of income which would have been paid to such child if living, shall be paid to my wife for and during the term of her lifetime.\u201d The will contains further provisions to create future interests.\nAfter Carl\u2019s death, the trustees of the estate of Harriet filed their 19th account. On exceptions, Carl\u2019s widow, Lena W. Reed, contended that ker kusband\u2019s will violated the rule against perpetuities and that distribution should now be made to her and his heirs in default of valid appointment. It was argued that one of the remainders is, in any view, void for remoteness, and that other future estates are likewise void unless Lena W. Reed can be considered the life in being. She must be so considered; though not then married to Carl Reed, she was living at the time of the death of the testatrix: see Warren\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 112, 114, 182 A. 396; Minot v. Paine, 230 Mass. 514, 120 N E. 167 (1918). In any event, the vested life estates for Lena W. Reed and h\u00e9r two children are valid; the\u2019trusts are active and must therefore be supported for their benefit. Whether provisions intended to benefit p\u00e1rties at the termination of these life estates are valid or not must be determined at the end of the life estates. There is no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the various trust provisions constituted such an. integrated plan that testator could not have intended some of the provisions to remain if others failed. See McCreary\u2019s Trust Estate, 328 Pa. 513, 196 A. 25; Quigley\u2019s Estate, 329 Pa. 281, 198 A. 85; Wanamaker\u2019s Estate, 335 Pa. 241, 6 A. 2d 852; Uch\u2019s Estate, 338 Pa. 396, 12 A. 2d 905.'\nIn each appeal the decree is affirmed, costs to be paid out of principal.\nThis provision was considered in Reed\u2019s Estate, 236 Pa. 572, 578, 85 A. 15.\nCompare Carroll v. Burns, 108 Pa. 386; Phila. v. River Front R., Co., 133 Pa. 134, 19 A. 356; Brock\u2019s Assigned Estate (No. 8), 312 Pa. 92. 166 A. 785."}
