{"id": "1044104", "contents": "Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court,\nPer Curiam.\n\u2014 There is no clearly-expressed intention in the will of Thomas Mull to bequeath over to certain persons, either by name or description, the principal of the legacy of $3000, in the event of the death of any of his children, in the lifetime of the widow. The only words are, \u201c to be equally divided among all my children or their legal heirs.\u201d If there were anything else in the will to evince the testator\u2019s meaning to be children when he used the words \u201clegal heirs,\u201d we might conclude th\u00e1t they were the legatees of the principal sum. But the form of the bequest to be \u201c equally divided among all my children,\u201d shows an evident intention to put all upon the same platform of ownership, which would carry a vested interest in all. The words following, \u201c or their legal heirs,\u201d evidently were used not to individuate grandchildren, but to supply a legal succession in the event of the death of any \u2018 one, and mean simply legal representatives. The legacies were therefore vested, and passed on the death of any one to his executors or administrators.\nJudgment affirmed."}
