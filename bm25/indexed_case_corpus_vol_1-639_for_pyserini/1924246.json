The petition was prepared by petitioner; counsel has merely furnished a backer and a typist. This is clearly not the \u201crepresentation in the role of an advocate\u201d which we require. Commonwealth v. Stancell, 435 Pa. 301, 256 A. 2d 798 (1969).\nThe record is remanded to the hearing court so that counsel can file a proper petition for allocatur."}
