{"id": "3017186", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 13th day of March 2007, the Commonwealth\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal in the above captioned matter is GRANTED. The Superior Court order is VACATED, and the judgment of sentence is REINSTATED.\nRespondent\u2019s claim that the trial court failed to provide sufficient reasons for the sentence imposed on the record at the time of sentencing, upon which the Superior Court granted relief, is waived as respondent did not adequately preserve it. Counsel for respondent never raised such an objection at the violation of probation proceeding and did not file a post-sentence motion preserving the claim. Therefore, because respondent raised this issue for the first time on appeal to the Superior Court, the issue is waived. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (issues not raised in lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal). Moreover, respondent\u2019s oral outburst at the proceeding cannot be construed as a proper objection by his counsel to the trial court\u2019s alleged failure to state on the record adequate reasons for the sentence imposed, and his ensuing assault on the trial judge and courtroom staff eliminated the court\u2019s opportunity to respond.\nIn addition, the Superior Court erred by sua sponte ordering the removal of the trial judge from respondent\u2019s resentencing. Commonwealth v. Whitmore, 912 A.2d 827, 2006 WL 3847624 (Pa.2006). Given this Court\u2019s reinstatement of the judgment of sentence, however, that additional error is rendered moot."}
