{"id": "1884557", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nAppellant entered into a mining lease with appellee for the period of one year commencing October 11, 1960. The lease contained a provision (a) giving appellant an option for renewal, and (b) giving appellee an option for termination of the lease at the end of the year. Appellant was evicted before the expiration of the year for reasons which on this record appear insufficient. Appellant filed a complaint in equity (1) for the specific performance of the lease for the year in question, and (2) for damages. That year has long since passed, and consequently specific performance could not now be granted. The Court below correctly sustained preliminary objections on the ground that appellant had an adequate remedy at law.\nThe appeal is dismissed, without prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s right to bring an appropriate action at law against the defendants. Each party to pay own costs."}
