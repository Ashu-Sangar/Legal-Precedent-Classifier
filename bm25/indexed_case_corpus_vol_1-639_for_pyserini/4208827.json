{"id": "4208827", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 2nd day of May 2012, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED, the portion of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s Order that reversed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board order is VACATED, and the order of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, which affirmed the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge\u2019s calculation of petitioner\u2019s average weekly wage, is REINSTATED. The WCJ did not err in finding that petitioner did not maintain a continuous employment relationship with Employer, as petitioner did not \u201cretain[ ] significant rights/accoutrements of employment\u201d with Employer. Contrast Reifsnyder v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Dana Corporation), 584 Pa.341, 883 A.2d 537, 547 (2005) (although injured employees were subject to work-related layoffs for business/economic reasons, these claimants \u201cnevertheless maintained continuous employment relationships with Employer[.] ... [I]n those down times where layoffs occurred, [pursuant to their collective bargaining agreement, cjlaimants retained significant rights/accoutrements of employment, such as plant seniority, healthcare and sick leave benefits, and employer contributions to their retirement accounts.\u201d). Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s calculation of petitioner\u2019s average weekly wage under 77 P.S. \u00a7 582(d) was erroneous and the WCJ\u2019s alternate calculation of petitioner\u2019s average weekly wage, which was affirmed by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board, was correct. The WCJ\u2019s alternate calculation is necessary to fairly assess claimant\u2019s earnings, Hannaberry HVAC v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Snyder, Jr.), 575 Pa.66, 834 A.2d 524 (2003), and advances the humanitarian purpose of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, id., and the purpose of Section 582 \u2014 to accurately capture economic reality when calculating claimant\u2019s average weekly wage.
