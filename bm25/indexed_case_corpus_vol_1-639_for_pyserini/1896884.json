{"id": "1896884", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThis case presents the question of whether a fund awarded by an orphans\u2019 court to the Commonwealth as custodian to be held for an Iron Curtain distributee is subject to foreign attachment in the County Court of Philadelphia by persons seeking to recover legal fees for their services as counsel for the distributee.\nDymytry Yaslyk died December 20, 1956, intestate, a resident of Philadelphia County. The Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia found that he was survived by a brother, Ilko, who resides in Russia, and that he had another brother, Michael, whose whereabouts was unknown at the time of the audit.\nAppellees are attorneys-at-law and acted on Ilko\u2019s behalf to secure his share of his brother\u2019s estate. This they did by designation of a New York law firm which, in turn, acted under a power of attorney purportedly executed by Ilko in Russia. The power authorized the New York firm, or its designated counsel, to represent Ilko\u2019s interest in the decedent\u2019s estate for a contingent fee of \u201c25% of the amount actually recovered from the estate.\u201d\nThe orphans\u2019 court awarded the entire distributable estate, without escheat, to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania as custodian. One half of the estate ($9,-985.97) was directed to be held for the benefit of Ilko under the provisions of the Pennsylvania \u201cIron Curtain Act\u201d and the other half was directed to be held for the benefit of Michael under \u00a71314 of The Fiscal Code.\nIn its adjudication, the orphans\u2019 court stated that \u201cthe Auditing Judge does not make any finding concerning the representation of . . . [appellees] for Ilko Yaslyk since it is unnecessary to do so in view of the awards that will be made hereinafter.\u201d No exceptions were filed to that adjudication nor was an appeal taken. However, shortly after the orphans\u2019 court adjudication, appellees instituted an action by foreign attachment against Ilko in the County Court of Philadelphia for their claimed fee of 25% ($2,500) of the award for Ilko\u2019s benefit. The administratrix of the decedent\u2019s estate and the bank where the funds were deposited were named as garnishees.\nThe Commonwealth of Pennsylvania was granted leave to intervene in the attachment proceedings and filed preliminary objections to the complaint. The county court sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the complaint without prejudice. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed that determination and remanded the cause with a procedendo. 204 Pa. Superior Ct. 66, 203 A. 2d 347 (1964). We granted allocatur. 205 Pa. Superior Ct. 1 (1965).\nAfter careful review of the record, analysis of the issues, and consideration of the governing principles, we are persuaded that the decision of the Superior Court must be reversed. In reality, what appellees seek to achieve in the county court proceeding is a determination in that forum which will reduce the full award of Xlko\u2019s beneficial interest to the Commonwealth by $2,500, the amount claimed by appellees. To allow such a procedure would be to permit a final orphans\u2019 court decree, confirming the final account of a fiduciary and awarding distribution of a decedent\u2019s estate, to be attacked and disturbed by a foreign attachment proceeding in a court of limited and non-estate jurisdiction.\nSuch a result not only ignores the conclusiveness of the orphans\u2019 court decree but is prohibited by the exclusive jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court mandated by statute and the limited, non-estate jurisdiction of the county court. The orphans\u2019 courts of the Commonwealth have exclusive jurisdiction of the administration and distribution of decedents\u2019 estates, of the control of estate fiduciaries, and of the settlement of their accounts. Horner v. First Penna. Banking & Trust Co., 412 Pa. 72, 194 A. 2d 335 (1963); Cole v. Wells, 406 Pa. 81, 177 A. 2d 77 (1962); Freihofer Estate, 405 Pa. 165, 174 A. 2d 282 (1961); Trout v. Lukey, 402 Pa. 123, 166 A. 2d 654 (1961). In this area of the law, and under our allocation of court jurisdiction, the county court, as well as the courts of common pleas, equity or other nisi prius courts are entirely without judicial power to act in the administration and distribution of decedents\u2019 estates.\nThe fiduciary of the estate being accountable solely to the orphans\u2019 court in the administration of the estate, and the distribution of estate assets being exclusively within the jurisdiction of the orphans\u2019 court, that tribunal\u2019s final decree awarding the estate balance to the Commonwealth as custodian was a conclusive direction to the fiduciary to comply with the mandated distribution. That adjudication and decree is subject to modification or alteration only by the orphans\u2019 court or an appellate tribunal under appropriate circumstances. Cf. Cole v. Wells, 406 Pa. 81, 177 A. 2d 77 (1962); In re Archdeacon, 134 N.J. Eq. 535, 37 A. 2d 34 (1944).\nThe county court correctly concluded that under the circumstances of this case it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the attachment proceeding. This result is required, not only by the specific jurisdictional provisions of the Orphans\u2019 Court Act but also by procedural and practical necessity for the orderly administration of decedents\u2019 estates. Any other result would have the chaotic effect of subjecting an estate fiduciary to the hazards and uncertainties of competing and conflicting directions by various courts in the administration and distribution of estates.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed and the order of the County Court of Philadelphia dismissing the complaint is affirmed.\nAct of July 28, 1953, P. L. 674, \u00a72, 20 P.S. \u00a71156 (Supp. 1964). The orphans\u2019 court directed that Ilko\u2019s share of the estate was \u201cto be held until such time as Ilko Yaslyk can prove that he will have the use, benefit, control and enjoyment thereof.\u201d\nAct of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343, \u00a71314, 72 P.S. \u00a71314.\nAt the time the writ of foreign attachment was issued, the money had not yet been transferred to the Commonwealth pursuant to the orphans\u2019 court decree.\nWeight, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nAct of August 10, 1951, P. L. 1163, \u00a7301, as amended, 20 P.S. 2080.301.\nAct of July 12, 1913, P. L. 711, \u00a7\u00a79, 10, 11, as amended, 17 AS. \u00a7\u00a7692, 693, 694.\nThe Superior Court, in reversing the county court, assumed that the trial court\u2019s determination was based, at least in part, on that court\u2019s holding that the issue of appellees\u2019 claim for counsel fees was decided in the orphans\u2019 court and was, therefore, res judicata. We do not so read the decision of the county court. The. opinion of that court quoted and relied upon the orphans\u2019 court adjudication which specificaUy stated that no finding was made concerning appellees\u2019 representation. Contrary to the impression of the Superior Court, the county court predicated its decision on the ground that a court of competent and exclusive jurisdiction in decedents\u2019 estates had made an unconditional and final award. The county court held, therefore, that it lacked judicial power \u201cto entertain a suit which would in any way conflict with the ahsolute award by the Orphans\u2019 Court.\u201d\nPa. R.C.P. 1252 provides that a foreign attachment may be issued to attach property not exempt from execution. While Weicht v. Automobile Banking Corp., 354 Pa. 433, 47 A. 2d 705 (1946), and Commonwealth v. Mooney, 172 Pa. Superior Ct. 30, 92 A. 2d 258 (1952), both contain aspects similar to the instant case, neither can be deemed controlling on the point of whether the fund became exempt from execution after the final orphans\u2019 court decree. Our examination of the issues involved persuades us that the fund is exempt from execution. Similarly, we do not interpret the Act of July 27, 1842, P. L. 436, \u00a71, 12 P.S. \u00a72897 as permitting the issuance of a writ of foreign attachment after the final decree of the orphans\u2019 court."}
