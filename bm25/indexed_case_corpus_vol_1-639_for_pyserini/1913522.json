{"id": "1913522", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Musmanno,\nOn August 28, 1964, Mrs. Nora KuminkosM entered tlie business establishment of the defendant Butler Packing Company to purchase a supply of meat. Emerging from the store, she fell on the outside steps leading down to the ground. She brought suit against the defendant, charging negligence in its allowing a dangerous substance to accumulate on the steps, and in not providing a handrail which she might have grasped to save herself from a fall which could be caused by slipping on the mixture of sawdust, wood chips and fine gravel which coated the treads of the descending exit.\nAt the ensuing trial the jury was unable to reach an unanimous verdict and was discharged. The defendant moved for judgment on the whole record under the Act of April 20, 1911, P. L. 70, 12 P.S. \u00a7684. The judge granted the motion. The plaintiff has appealed.\nThe judgment entered by the court below cannot be affirmed under existing law. The Superior Court, following utterances of this Court to the same effect, but not as succinctly phrased, well declared in the case of Johnson v. Dew, 204 Pa. Superior Ct. 526, that: \u201cJudgment can be entered for the defendant on the whole record only if the evidence, viewed in the light most advantageous to the plaintiff, resolving all conflicts therein in his favor, and giving him the benefit of every fact and inference pertaining to the issues involved which may be reasonably deduced therefrom, would not justify a verdict and judgment in his favor.\u201d\nThe record in the case at bar does not justify the conclusion that a verdict for the plaintiff could not be sustained by the evidence. It shows that for a long time prior to the plaintiff\u2019s accident, the defendant was accustomed to sprinkling the floor of its store with sawdust. It was clear also that this sawdust was tracked outside and some of it fell to the outside steps. Unbeknownst to the plaintiff, and without her having any chance to become acquainted with that fact, some wood chips and fine gravel commingled with the sawdust on the steps to form an unfirm surface. In leaving the store, the plaintiff was carrying a large package, this being the meat she had purchased therein, and thus could not minutely perceive the constituency of the substance which passed under each footstep. Under such circumstances, the plaintiff could not, as a matter of law, be charged with contributory negligence in not having seen, even assuming it was ocularly dis:c\u00e9rnible, the mixture of the elements which pomaded the steps.\nThe court below, in entering judgment for the defendant, said that the plaintiff had not met the burden of proof of establishing an unsafe condition. In the case of Katz v. John Wanamaker Phila., Inc., 381 Pa. 477, the trial court directed a verdict for the defendant, asserting that the evidence adduced by the plaintiff was insufficient to establish liability on the part of the defendant. There, as here, the plaintiff had fallen on slippery steps under conditions not dissimilar to the ones at bar. In reversing the lower court, this Court said: \u201cFrom-the testimony of the two women the jury could have found that there was: a considerable quantity of dirt as well as water on the steps, and that the combination of the two could, form a slimy and slippery condition. Plaintiff\u2019s evidence must'be considered in, the light most favorable to her with, the benefit of the inference deducible from; the testimony. So considered, we cannot say that plaintiff failed to make out the existence of an unsafe or dangerous condition.\u201d\nIn the instant case, it would be a most reasonable inference from the evidence that the commingling of sawdust, wood chips and fine gravel, could produce a skidding surface.\nThe plaintiff also charged the defendant with negligence in failing to provide a handrail in a situation where such an item would be required if the defendant was to honor its obligations to exercise reasonable care for the safety of its customers. A possessor of land encumbered by a set of steps which, because of exposure to weather or other foreseeable conditions, may become slippery or otherwise unsafe to pedestrians, has the duty in its exercise of reasonable care, to equip the stairway with a graspable handrail or some other device which may offer refuge in the event the pedestrian loses his footing.\nThe court below also said that the plaintiff had not proved that the defendant knew or should have known of the existence of the unsafe condition. In Katz v. John Wanamaker, 381 Pa. 477, this Court said: \u201cWhat will amount to constructive notice of a defective or dangerous condition existing upon a defendant\u2019s premises, necessarily varies under the circumstances of each case and is not solely determinable by the lapse of time between the origin of the unsafe condition and the accident.\u201d\nThe presence of the sawdust on the steps was not a mere chance occurrence but a continuing condition known to the defendant. Its mixing with other substances to produce a dangerous situation for patrons of the defendant\u2019s establishment was a set of facts from which the jury could conclude constructive notice to the defendant.\nJudgment reversed with a venire facias de novo.\nMr. Justice Eagen, Mr. Justice O\u2019Brien and Mr. .Justice Egberts concur in the result.\nMr. Justice Jones and Mr. Justice Cohen dissent."}
