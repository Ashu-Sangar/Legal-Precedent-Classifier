{"id": "989700", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nWhen this case was here last year, the tenth finding of the court below, \u201cthat\u2018accessions\u2019 had been made to the fund from some source,\u201d etc., was not sustained, because it was \u201cnot a finding of fact from the evidence,\u201d but an unwarranted \u201c inference of the learned judge from Mrs. Eyer\u2019s method of dealing with her securities,\u201d etc.: Beale v. Kline, 183 Pa. 149, 154. The decree was accordingly reversed and the record remitted, with a procedendo, that the accounts might be restated in accordance with the opinion then filed.\nOur examination of the record, as now presented, has satisfied us that the restated accounts substantially conform to the requirements of said opinion. There is nothing in either of the specifications of error that requires special notice. They are all overruled.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellants\u2019 costs."}
