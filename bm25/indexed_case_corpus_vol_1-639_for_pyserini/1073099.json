{"id": "1073099", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn tMs case the court below entered judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense, in an action founded on certain sales memoranda of the same character as that quoted in our opinion in Franklin Sugar Refining Company v. Howell, filed herewith [reported above]. The questions raised and decided there are controlling here also, and hence the same judgment must be entered.\nThe judgment of the court below is reversed and a procedendo is awarded."}
