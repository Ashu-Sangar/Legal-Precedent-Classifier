{"id": "1767228", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nOn July 29, 1977, the Commonwealth commenced this forfeiture proceeding by petition in the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County under \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 29 of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, Act of April 14, 1972, P.L. 233, No. 64, as amended, 35 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 780-128 and 780-129 (the Act). The subject of the proceeding was a 1976 Ford truck van which appellee Guy Walter Wagner had used for the unlawful transportation of marijuana and cocaine. The only defense appellee asserted was that \u00a7\u00a7 28 and 29 \u2014 the forfeiture provisions \u2014 of the Act were \u201cviolative of [his] rights to due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the applicable provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\u201d After holding that the forfeiture provisions of the Act were unconstitutional because they failed to mandate notice or an opportunity to be heard prior to forfeiture, the Court of Common Pleas denied the Commonwealth\u2019s petition. 6 Pa. D.&C.3d 511, aff\u2019d, 8 Pa. D.&C.3d 115 (1978). The Commonwealth has appealed directly to this Court.\nThe Commonwealth asserts that appellee lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of the forfeiture provisions of the Act. Counsel for appellee conceded in the court below \u201cthat [appellee] has been afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard in defense of his vehicle.\u201d 6 Pa. D.&C.3d at 512. Despite this concession and the court\u2019s recognition that \u201cthe respondent\u2019s standing to challenge the constitutionality of the forfeiture statute is not without question since he has not been injured by any alleged deficiency in the wording thereof,\u201d id., the court went on to resolve the constitutional issue before it. We think that appellee\u2019s standing in this case is not merely questionable; it is, rather, wholly lacking. Accordingly, we do not reach the constitutional issue presented.\nOur cases hold that \u201cno one has standing to question the constitutionality of an Act of Assembly unless and until he can show that his constitutional rights have been or will be violated by the Act\u2019s enforcement.\u201d Booz v. Reed, 398 Pa. 172, 175-76, 157 A.2d 170, 172 (1960) (emphasis added). See also Rich Hill Coal Company v. Chesnut, 355 Pa. 13, 47 A.2d 801 (1946); Knowles\u2019 Estate, 295 Pa. 571, 145 A. 797, 63 A.L.R. 1086 (1929).\nIn this case, appellee has suffered no violation of his constitutional right to due process. Even if the forfeiture provisions of the Act were unconstitutional on their face, any violation of appellee\u2019s rights that would have resulted from strict compliance with the Act has been prevented by the actual notice and opportunity for hearing that appellee received. We therefore hold that appellee has no standing to challenge the constitutionality of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act.\nThe order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings.\nROBERTS, J., would vacate the order and remand the case.\n. See Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, as amended, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 722(7).\n. We note, however, that since the date of the lower court\u2019s opinions in this case, the Commonwealth Court has determined that the forfeiture provisions of the Act meet due process requirements.
