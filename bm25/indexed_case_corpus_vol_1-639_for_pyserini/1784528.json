{"id": "1784528", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Chief Justice.\nThe present appeal arises out of appellant\u2019s second trial on charges of murder (two counts), conspiracy, and aggravated assault. Appellant, Mack Truesdale, was charged in connection with a shooting episode which occurred on October 17, 1975, as a result of a dispute over the sale of narcotics. As in the first trial, the jury found appellant guilty of two counts of murder of the first degree, and returned the death penalty on both counts. The jury also found appellant guilty of conspiracy and aggravated assault. Sentences of death were imposed on the verdicts of guilty of murder of the first degree, a sentence of five to ten years\u2019 imprisonment was imposed on the conspiracy verdict and a sentence of eleven and one-half to twenty-three months\u2019 imprisonment was imposed on the verdict of aggravated assault. All sentences were ordered to run consecutively.\nAppellant raises several allegations of trial error in support of his request for a new trial. He first argues that the trial court impermissibly restricted his right of confrontation when the court curtailed his cross-examination of George Jackson, the key Commonwealth witness and the victim of the aggravated assault. He contends that he should have been permitted to pursue questions regarding Jackson\u2019s probationary status at the time of the offense as a means of impeaching Jackson\u2019s credibility. We agree with the trial court\u2019s holding that, assuming the court erred in sustaining the Commonwealth\u2019s objection, the error was harmless. See Commonwealth v. Thornton, 494 Pa. 260, 431 A.2d 248 (1981). The trial court correctly summarized the record when it stated:\n\u201cDefendant was able to fully explore Mr. Jackson\u2019s possible motive in testifying by establishing that Mr. Jackson was never arrested for or charged with the crimes of Possession of Controlled Substances or Possession of a Firearm on the day of the incident or thereafter, despite the fact that the police found drugs in Mr. Jackson\u2019s home, and that Mr. Jackson admitted to those crimes (N.T. 9/24/80, pp. 148-150). In addition, defense counsel fully explored the question of what, if any, protection and money Mr. Jackson received from the District Attorney\u2019s Office for his testimony (N.T. 9/24/80, pp. 229-234). Hence, this Court\u2019s failure to permit defense counsel to explore the issue of Mr. Jackson\u2019s possible bias by means of questioning his probationary status was harmless in light of the other vigorous attacks made on Mr. Jackson\u2019s interests in the case.\u201d\nTrial court opinion at 4.\nAppellant next argues that the trial court erred in permitting witness Jackson and a detective to testify that Jackson had identified a photograph of appellant shown to him by police several hours after the offense. This claim does not present a basis for relief. The testimony made it clear that the photograph was shown to Jackson after Jackson had asked to see a photograph of \u201cLieutenant Mack\u201d and after Jackson had told police at the crime scene that \u201cMack shot me! Mack shot me!\u201d As the trial court concluded, there was no evidence that should have reasonably suggested to the jury that the photograph was obtained as a result of prior criminal activity on the part of appellant. See generally Commonwealth v. Allen, 448 Pa. 177, 181, 292 A.2d 373, 375 (1972) (\u201cthe controlling question is whether or not a juror could reasonably infer from the facts presented that the accused had engaged in prior criminal activity\u201d). The photograph was not admitted into evidence or shown to the jury. Nor was the photograph described or any reference made to the photograph as a \u201cmug shot\u201d or as having been obtained from a police file. See Commonwealth v. Carlos, 462 Pa. 262, 341 A.2d 71 (1975). See also Commonwealth v. Povish, 479 Pa. 179, 188, 387 A.2d 1282, 1287 (1978).\nAppellant\u2019s challenge to the Commonwealth\u2019s introduction into evidence of black and white photographs of the victims and the crime scene must also fail. As a review of the photographs demonstrates that the photographs had probative value and were not inflammatory, the trial court cannot be deemed to have abused its discretion in admitting the challenged photographs, nor can appellant\u2019s counsel be deemed ineffective for having failed to request a cautionary instruction as to the photographs\u2019 evidentiary value. See Commonwealth v. Martinez, 475 Pa. 331, 380 A.2d 747 (1977); Commonwealth v. Petrakovich, 459 Pa. 511, 329 A.2d 844 (1974).\nIn addition to his allegations of trial error, appellant contends, as he did both at the sentencing stage and on post-trial motions, that the 1978 death penalty statute was improperly applied to his retrial, both because the Legislature did not intend the 1978 statute to apply to offenses committed prior to its effective date, and because if there had been no reversible error at appellant\u2019s 1977 trial, the applicable law, Commonwealth v. Moody, supra at note 1 (ruling the Act of 1974 unconstitutional), would have required that a sentence of life imprisonment be imposed on the appeal from his first conviction. Appellant relies upon this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Story, 497 Pa. 273, 440 A.2d 488 (1981), which held that the 1978 death penalty statute could not properly be applied to a defendant\u2019s retrial for an offense which was committed prior to the enactment of the 1978 statute.\nThe Commonwealth acknowledges that appellant\u2019s case is legally indistinguishable from Story but urges that the death sentences be affirmed on the ground that Story was erroneously decided. The Commonwealth\u2019s request that Story be reconsidered must be rejected, for principles of stare decisis and fundamental fairness, which are of paramount importance in the review of death sentences, manifestly require that the same interpretation of the 1978 death penalty statute be applied in our review of appellant\u2019s case as was applied in Story. Accordingly, the sentences of death imposed by the court of common pleas must be vacated and life sentences imposed, to be served consecutively on the two counts of murder of the first degree.\nThe judgments of sentence of death are vacated and consecutive sentences of life imprisonment imposed. The sentences imposed on the verdicts of conspiracy and aggravated assault are affirmed, and are to run consecutive to the two consecutive sentences of life imprisonment.\n. The verdicts entered in appellant\u2019s first trial were set aside on July 5, 1977, by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, sitting en banc upon a finding, on post-trial motions, that \u201cthe Assistant District Attorney\u2019s conduct was improper and prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d\nIn the first trial, which was conducted in January 1977, the death penalty was sought pursuant to the Act of March 26, 1974, P.L. 213. In November of 1977, the Act of 1974 was declared unconstitutional. Commonwealth v. Moody, 476 Pa. 223, 382 A.2d 442 (1977), cert. denied, 438 U.S. 914, 98 S.Ct. 3143, 57 L.Ed.2d 1160 (1978). The death penalty in the second trial, which was conducted in September 1980, was sought pursuant to the Act of September 13, 1978, P.L. 756.\n. Appellant\u2019s appeals from the convictions of conspiracy and aggravated assault were filed in the Superior Court and subsequently certified to this Court for consideration together with appellant\u2019s appeals from the murder convictions.\n. On this appeal appellant is represented by counsel other than trial counsel. Present counsel was appointed to represent appellant at the time of post-trial motions.\n. In a related argument, appellant contends that the trial court erroneously refused to grant a mistrial or sustain his objection when witness Jackson gave an unsolicited statement that \u201cthere were thirteen attempts made on my life while I was in the hospital.\u201d This statement was made on redirect examination following the Commonwealth\u2019s question, \u201cBut did we give you protection so the jury and the court knows?\u201d The area of the Commonwealth\u2019s inquiry was opened by appellant on cross-examination and hence properly within the scope of redirect examination. The witness\u2019s statement, while unresponsive to the question, was the only mention during the trial of any threats on the witness\u2019s life. On this record, the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant appellant his requested relief does not constitute reversible error. See generally Commonwealth v. Stetler, 494 Pa. 551, 431 A.2d 992 (1981) (new trial not required by introduction of evidence that victim had been \u201charassed\u201d by persons unknown).\n. Appellant\u2019s remaining claims of trial error challenge the composition of the jury and the effectiveness of trial counsel\u2019s closing argument. These claims, too, must be rejected as having no merit."}
