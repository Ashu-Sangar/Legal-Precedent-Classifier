{"id": "4281162", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 8th day of November, 2013, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED, LIMITED to the Petitioner\u2019s first issue in part and second issue, paraphrased as follows for clarity:\n1. Whether the Commonwealth Court ignored a statute limiting the reimbursement of attorneys\u2019 fees to the condemnee for fees actually incurred, instead crafting a judicial remedy requiring the condemnor to pay fees not actually incurred by the condemnee?\n2. Whether the Commonwealth Court erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s award of $179,000 of $187,000 requested in attorneys\u2019 fees for preparing a fee petition even though the trial court had disallowed over $500,000 of the $1,100,000 in attorneys\u2019 fees requested in the petition?\nThe Petition for Allowance of Appeal is DENIED in all other respects."}
