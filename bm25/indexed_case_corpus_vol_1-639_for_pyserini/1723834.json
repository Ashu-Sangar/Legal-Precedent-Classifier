{"id": "1723834", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nAppellant raises the following arguments on appeal: (1) the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the jury verdict of murder of the first degree; (2) the indictment was defective and should have been quashed; (3) appellant\u2019s statements to the police should have been suppressed; (4) the photographs of the victim should not have been admitted into evidence; (5) the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury were inadequate; and (6) the verdict form submitted to the jury was prejudicial in that it put undue emphasis on murder of the first degree. Our review of the record satisfies us that these contentions are without merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed."}
