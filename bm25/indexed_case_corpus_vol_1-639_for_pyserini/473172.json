{"id": "473172", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nPlaintiff, Seaboard Container Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation, filed an action in trespass against defendant Edwin L. Bothschild, trading as Bothschild Construction Company, and additional defendant Max Corchin, Inc., appellant, for damages to personal property resulting from a fire allegedly due to appellant\u2019s negligence, and after trial recovered a verdict for |4,559.04. A rule for judgment n. o. v. and a new trial were denied. This appeal followed.\nAppellant was engaged by the defendant as subcontractor to do certain repair, renovation, and reconstruction work on a crane run-way on premises occupied by plaintiff at South 49th St., Philadelphia. The parties to the contract for repairs were the Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities, mortgagee in possession of the aforesaid premises, and Edwin L. Bothschild, trading as Bothschild Construction Company, contractor.\nThe work undertaken by Max Corchin, Inc., as an independent contractor, consisted of \u201creinforcing the steel columns to the building\u201d by the use of \u201cacetylene torches, rivets and riveting gun\u201d. The building, which was a warehouse for wrapping paper, was settling and required bracing \u201cso that it wouldn\u2019t settle any more\u201d. On February 1, 1941, while appellant was engaged in the performance of its sub-contract, a fire occurred caused by a \u201chot rivet\u201d which damaged plaintiff\u2019s wrapping paper stored inside the building.\nAt the trial, plaintiff\u2019s counsel introduced the testimony of appellant\u2019s general erection superintendent, Jack Corchin, and that of the foreman on the job, Foss Mnnksjaard. Plaintiff rested at the close of these witnesses\u2019 testimony, whereupon defense counsel made a motion for a nonsuit \u201con the ground that they haven\u2019t even shown agency, much less negligence.\u201d The trial judge recognizing plaintiff\u2019s failure to establish agency and negligence permitted its counsel to recall the last witness. After re-examination of the witness, defense counsel said \u201cNo questions\u201d. The motion for a non-suit was denied on the following day. Defendant thereupon requested permission to cross-examine plaintiff\u2019s witnesses in order \u201cto strengthen or weaken the testimony\u201d on the ground that after the close of his case plaintiff\u2019s counsel was \u201cpermitted to reopen it again.\u201d This request was denied and the trial proceeded to a verdict.\nThe record discloses that about a week before appellant began its work, Jack Corchin, general erection superintendent, after making a survey of the building, approached Mr. Rosenfeld, treasurer of plaintiff company, and advised him \u201cthat all papers that might burn should be removed, covered or otherwise disposed of so that it wouldn't burn.\u201d Mr. Corchin testified that \u201cHe [Rosenfeld] assured me that the rolls of paper, the way the paper was rolled \u2014 it was heavy wrapping paper and it wouldn\u2019t burn under any conditions. However, near the front door there were some scraps of paper from the rolls . . . He told me that he would take care of all of that and not to worry about any part of that, just to go ahead and do my work.\u201d In view of plaintiff\u2019s failure to remove or protect this paper lying inside the building, Foss Munksjaard, on February 1, 1941, obtained a piece of \u201cgreasy tarpaulin\u201d from an employee in plaintiff\u2019s Maintenance Department and laid it on top of the paper to shield it against \u201chot rivets\u201d. At that time one of Munksjaard\u2019s men \u201cwas cutting rivets off\u201d \u201cwith an acetylene torch\u201d. The rivet got hot and \u201cfell from the column\u201d. According to Munksjaard\u2019s testimony the \u201crivet fell right down on the tarpaulin and the tarpaulin blew up, caught fire, the grease. The first thing we done was, we grabbed the tarpaulin and threw it out on the platform. . . . Me and a couple of other fellows, we grabbed hold of it [the tarpaulin] and carried it out and let it burn. . . . While it was burning we threw it out there and we came back with other water and I grabbed the paper. In ten or fifteen minutes the fire was out, but in the meantime the engines [from the Fire Department] came there and squirted some chemical stuff on the scrap paper.\u201d He added that \u201cThe fire was out when the engine came there . . . but they poured the chemical on anyhow.\u201d\nThe sole issue is as to the right of recovery. It is claimed that plaintiff\u2019s failure to protect its paper against the possibility of becoming ignited after its treasurer received the above-stated warning, amounted to a voluntary assumption of risk and that plaintiff\u2019s Maintenance Department employee\u2019s supplying appellant\u2019s workman with the greasy tarpaulin was evidence of contributory negligence.\nThe trial judge is charged with error: (1) In allowing plaintiff to re-open its ease after it was closed, appellant made a motion for nonsuit, and the court indicated that plaintiff failed to establish a cause of action. (2) In refusing to allow counsel for the Appellant (additional defendant below) to cross-examine the witness recalled by the plaintiff after plaintiff had once closed its case and motion for nonsuit had been made and plaintiff was allowed to reopen its case and then had reclosed its case and a second motion for nonsuit had been made and refused by the Court. (3) In refusing to charge the jury on the law of contributory negligence in Pennsylvania and (4) In charging the jury: \u201cIn such circumstances, (the circumstances of the instant case) the defense of assumption of risk or contributory carelessness would not be available to the defendant.\u201d\nThe matters complained of in defendant\u2019s first and second assignments of error relate to the exercise of the trial judge\u2019s discretion, and that will not be interfered with except for clear abuse of its discretion. 26 R.C.L. 1042, section 48 states: \u201cIt is well settled that a trial court, for the purpose of receiving further evidence, may reopen a case after the parties have rested, though it should never do so except for good reasons and on a proper showing, and this power continues after the case has been given to the jury and before they have delivered their verdict.\u201d\n\u201cIt is common practice for the presiding judge, where counsel for the plaintiff has omitted evidence by accident, inadvertence, or even because of a mistake as to the necessity for offering a particular witness or particular evidence, to allow the case to be reopened and additional evidence introduced in order to prevent a nonsuit\u201d: 26 R.C.L. 1043, section 49. The challenged court\u2019s action was not an abuse of discretion. Nor do we find any abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request to cross-examine plaintiff\u2019s witnesses for impeachment purposes. Defendant\u2019s counsel had ample opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses at the time he said: \u201cNo questions\u201d. We reject the contention of defendant that it should be granted \u201ca second opportunity as the plaintiff had to strengthen or weaken the testimony\u201d.\nThe remaining assignments of error relate to the trial judge\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury with regard to the doctrine of contributory negligence and to his declaring as a matter of law that such defense was unavailable to the defendant. Defendant avers that before it proceeded with its work it \u201cwarned plaintiff to remove inflammable goods and plaintiff said that it would but even if it did not [do so] defendant should not bother about it but go on with its work\u201d. Defendant argues that this act of omission on the part of plaintiff, coupled with the fact that plaintiff\u2019s Maintenance Department employee had supplied defendant with the greasy tarpaulin, justifies the inference of contributory negligence and a voluntary assumption of risk. The court in its opinion said: \u201c. . . its [plaintiff\u2019s] failure to do so [remove the paper] was not, in our judgment, a proximate cause of the fire. That may have made it possible for the paper to be damaged by the fire and the department\u2019s efforts to extinguish it, but it in no sense caused the fire that was started by the subsequent, intervening and negligent use of the tarpaulin by the defendant\u2019s employees. ... It was the use that the foreman made of the tarpaulin after he borrowed it with full knowledge of its dangerous condition that was clearly the proximate cause of the fire . . .\u201d\nWe agree with the conclusions thus expressed.- Of course, if plaintiff could reasonably have foreseen that a hot rivet or other ignitive object was likely to be dropped on the tarpaulin and cause it to burst into flame, the plaintiff would have been under the duty to take adequate means to meet that reasonably foreseeable contingency. The tarpaulin the foreman used-, instead of being an insulation against fire, as the situation required, was in a condition to burst into flame as soon as blazing hot rivets fell upon it. But the ordinary individual whose conduct is being adjudged as to its alleged want of care under certain circumstances is not compelled in order to avoid the imputation of negligence to show that even a specialist in foreseeability could not have foreseen the likelihood of the happening which actually took place. See Andrews v. Smith et ux., 324 Pa. 455, 188 A. 146, where we quoted with approval what Justice Holmes of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts said in Com. v. Pierce, 138 Mass. 165, as follows: \u201c \u2018Knowledge of the dangerous character of a thing is only the equivalent of foresight of the way in which it will act. If the thing is generally supposed to be universally harmless, and only a specialist would foresee that in a given case it would do damage, a person who did not foresee it and who had no warning would not be held liable for the harm. . . \u201d\nIn McClung v. Penna. T. Cab Co., 252 Pa. 478, 97 A. 694, we held that a person injured by the negligence of another is not deprived of all remedies merely because, at the time, he was occupying an unusual position in a conveyance, unless he thereby cooperated in causing his injuries. It is rarely, if ever, that a person can have negligence imputed to him because he did not foresee another\u2019s negligence and take appropriate action in anticipation of it.\nContributory negligence is defined in 45 C.J. 942, section 501, as \u201cconduct for which plaintiff is responsible, amounting to a breach of the duty which the law imposes upon persons to protect themselves from injury, and which, concurring and cooperating with actionable negligence for which defendant is responsible, contributes to the injury complained of as a proximate cause. Contributory negligence is usually the personal default of plaintiff; and it must be either his own or that of someone whose negligence is legally attributed to him.\u201d There was nothing in this case from which any reasonable person could infer plaintiff\u2019s negligence. Plaintiff had the right to assume that defendant by its employees would perform with due care the work contracted for. Plaintiff was not bound to anticipate that defendant would allow hot rivets to fall on the floor without defendant\u2019s providing some means of rendering them harmless. Defendant recognized this obligation when its \u201cforeman in charge of the work\u201d asked \u201csome man\u201d in plaintiff\u2019s maintenance department \u201cfor a tarpaulin to cover the paper\u201d. When the maintenance man gave the tarpaulin to the foreman the latter said, \u201cDon\u2019t you think there is a lot of grease on the tarpaulin?\u201d If the trapaulin, because of its greasy condition was not adapted to the function 'of \u201ccatching\u201d hot rivets as they fell and preventing their igniting paper and other property the defendant\u2019s foreman should not have used it for that purpose. It was the duty of the defendant to provide a competent and careful foreman for the work contracted for. Plaintiff was not bound to anticipate that the defendant would not place such a foreman in charge of the work. We have often stated that one cannot be adjudged negligent for failure to anticipate another\u2019s negligence. In this case it was the court\u2019s duty to hold as a matter of law that plaintiff was not negligent. See McCracken v. Curwensville Boro., 309 Pa. 98, 114, 163 A. 217; Goodstein v. King, 298 Pa. 313,148 A. 300.\nIn performing its work, defendant employed a dangerous instrumentality, to wit, a greasy tarpaulin which a hot rivet would easily ignite, \u201cWhile no absolute standard of duty in dealing with such agencies [i. e., dangerous agencies] can be prescribed, it is safe to say in general terms that every reasonable precaution suggested by experience and the known dangers of the subject ought to be taken.\u201d Koelsch v. The Philadelphia Co., 152 Pa. 355, 362, 25 A. 522. Since the hot rivets produced and let fall by defendant\u2019s employees while at work were a source of danger to plaintiff\u2019s property, defendant was under the duty of utilizing every practicable means to protect plaintiff\u2019s property against damage likely to be caused by them. The use of greasy and therefore inflammable tarpaulin was under the circumstances negligence. The fact that the tarpaulin was procured from an employee of the plaintiff did not constitute contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
