{"id": "896091", "contents": "Per. Curiam,\nThis appeal is from the refusal of the court below to take off the judgment of nonsuit. Our consideration of the evidence, on which the plaintiff relied, has satisfied us that no error was committed in denying his motion. Neither a review of the testimony, nor a discussion of the questions involved would serve any useful purpose. The assignment of error is dismissed and the judgment affirmed."}
