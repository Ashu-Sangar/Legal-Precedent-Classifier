{"id": "1213367", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nBy his will, James Hemphill, deceased, divided his residuary estate into five equal shares, one of which he gave in trust to pay the income to his unmarried son, Horace, for life. In the event Horace married and predeceased his wife it was provided the income from one-third of Horace\u2019s share should be paid to the wife during her lifetime. The income from the other two-thirds and, ultimately, the entire principal was directed to be paid to Horace\u2019s children, him surviving, in equal shares. Testator then provided as follows: \u201cIn ease of the death of my said son, Horace F. Hemphill, unmarried and leaving no lawful issue, then the said one-fifth part or share shall . . . revert to and become part of my general residuary estate, and shall, as such, be divided equally among my other sons and daughters . . .\u201d Horace married and subsequently died, leaving to-survive him his widow, Elizabeth N. Hemphill, but no issue.\nAt the audit of the trustee\u2019s second account, Elizabeth N. Hemphill, acting as administratrix of Horace\u2019s estate, took the position that since he had not died unmarried the gift over to the other sons and daughters could not take effect; that an intestacy resulted as to the principal of Horace\u2019s share; and that the two-thirds thereof released from the payment of income by Horace\u2019s death should be distributed under the intestate laws. The auditing judge rejected this claim on the ground that the phrase \u201cunmarried and leaving no lawful issue\u201d must b\u00e9 read as \u201cunmarried or leaving no lawful issue\u201d to effectuate the plain intention of the testator; this construction was sustained by the court en banc after argument on exceptions filed by appellant; and the present appeal followed.\nAs said in Calder\u2019s Estate, 343 Pa. 30, 34: \u201cIn gathering the meaning of words and phrases and the sense in which they are used, the context and the will as a whole must be taken into account: Smith\u2019s Petition, 291 Pa. 129, 134.\u201d So doing, we conclude, as did the court below, that testator could not have intended the gift over of Horace\u2019s share to take effect only in the event he died unmarried, but as well in the event he died without issue surviving, whether married or not; hence that the substitution of \u201cor\u201d for \u201cand\u201d was proper. \u201cTo effectuate the intention of a testator, the word \u2018and\u2019 may be read \u2018or\u2019. Attention need not be called to the numerous authorities to sustain this. Uncertainty is sometimes the result of the improper use of \u2018or\u2019 for \u2018and\u2019, or vice versa. The general rule in such cases is that the one word will be construed to have been used for the other, where the plain intent of the testator will be defeated without such substitution . .
