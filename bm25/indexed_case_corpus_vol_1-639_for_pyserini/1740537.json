{"id": "1740537", "contents": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nWhen appellant, a Pennsylvania corporation, filed its consolidated Federal corporate income tax return for calendar year 1969, it elected to claim the taxes which it paid to foreign governments as a credit against its Federal tax liability rather than as a deduction from its gross income. Since the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax Act of May 16, 1935, P.L. 208, \u00a7 1 et seq. as amended, 72 P.S. 3420a et seq. (herein referred to as \u201cthe \u2018act\u2019 \u201d) provided that a corporation\u2019s taxable income (for the purposes of calculating state tax liability) consisted of those funds which the Federal government designated as taxable on the corporation\u2019s Federal tax return, appellant, because it did not claim a deduction for foreign taxes on its 1969 Federal return, did not deduct said foreign taxes from its 1969 state return.\nOn December 17, 1970, appellant and the State Auditor General reached a settlement on appellant\u2019s state tax liability for calendar year 1969.\nOn March 10, 1972, the director of the State Bureau of Corporation Taxes issued a document entitled Taxing Memorandum No. 83 which provided that a corporation, when filing its state tax return, could claim foreign taxes as a deduction from its gross income even though said corporation did not deduct the foreign taxes from its Federal return. Accordingly, on May 5, 1972, appellant filed a petition with the State Board of Finance and Revenue requesting a partial refund of the taxes that appellant paid to the Commonwealth for calendar year 1969. Appellant claimed that it was entitled to this refund since, in determining its state tax liability for calendar year 1969, appellant did not deduct foreign taxes from its gross income as it was permitted to do under Taxing Memorandum No. 83.\nThe Board of Finance and Revenue denied appellant\u2019s petition for a partial refund of its 1969 state taxes. Appellant appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Commonwealth Court, which affirmed the Board\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s refund petition. Subsequently, appellant filed this appeal of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision in this Court.\nOn April 2, 1973, the director of the Bureau of Corporation Taxes rescinded Taxing Memorandum No. 83.\nAppellant\u2019s first contention is that since Section 3420c of the Act provided that a corporation was required to pay a state excise tax only \u201cupon each dollar of net income . received by . and accruing to\u201d said corporation, appellant was entitled to deduct the foreign taxes because it never \u201creceived\u201d the taxes which it paid to foreign governments. Appellant\u2019s argument is misplaced since it ignores the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cnet income\u201d; the Act defines \u201cnet income\u201d as the corporation\u2019s \u201ctaxable income . as ascertained by the Federal Government ...\u201d for Federal tax purposes. 72 P.S. \u00a7 3420(b)(2)(c). Thus, in determining whether appellant\u2019s foreign taxes should be considered as part of \u201cnet income\u201d (and hence subject to the state corporate net income tax), our sole inquiry is whether the amount of said foreign taxes was included as \u201ctaxable income\u201d on appellant\u2019s Federal return. By not claiming a Federal tax deduction for the foreign taxes, appellant treated the amount of those taxes as included within the figure which comprised \u201ctaxable income\u201d on its Federal return; accordingly, the amount of foreign taxes paid by the taxpayer must be treated as included within the amount to be shown as \u201cnet income\u201d on appellant\u2019s state tax return.\nAppellant\u2019s second contention is that the Commonwealth\u2019s refusal to partially refund the taxes which appellant paid for calendar year 1969 violated appellant\u2019s rights under the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution and the uniformity clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution. The basis for appellant\u2019s argument is that appellant, by not being permitted to deduct foreign taxes from its state tax return, was taxed at a higher rate than those corporations which were allowed to deduct foreign taxes from their state tax returns.\nIn the past, this Court has held that in matters of taxation, allegations of violations of the equal protection clause and the uniformity clause are analyzed in the same manner. Fisher Controls Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsyl vania, 476 Pa. 119,-, 381 A.2d 1253, 1256 (1977). Further, this Court has held that a state tax is not violative of the uniformity clause if the tax \u201capplies to all corporations with which the Commonwealth has power constitutionally to deal . . Where the (state tax) base is the same and the rate unvarying, there is no lack of uniformity.\u201d Commonwealth v. Warner Brothers Theatres, Inc., 345 Pa. 270, 274, 27 A.2d 62, 64 (1942). In the case at bar, it is obvious that the Act did not violate the uniformity clause because the Act\u2019s tax base, the corporation\u2019s \u201ctaxable income . (as) ascertained by the Federal Government\u201d for Federal tax purposes, applied the \u201csame . . . unvarying\u201d rate to all corporations.\nFurther, the sole reason that appellant paid more taxes than those corporations which were permitted to deduct foreign taxes from their state tax returns was that unlike those other corporations, appellant chose to claim the foreign taxes as a credit against Federal tax liability rather than as Federal tax deduction from its gross income and, thus, appellant was not entitled to deduct the foreign taxes from its gross income on its state return. Appellant\u2019s election of claiming the foreign taxes as a credit rather than as a deduction on its Federal tax return was voluntary.\nAppellant\u2019s third contention is that the equal protection and uniformity clauses were violated by the Commonwealth because appellant, unlike corporations who settled their state tax liabilities while Taxing Memorandum No. 83 was in effect, was not permitted to deduct said foreign taxes from its state return. \u201cA taxpayer complaining that administration of a tax violates its rights to be taxed uniformly with others in its class must demonstrate \u2018deliberate, purposeful discrimination in the application of the tax . before constitutional safeguards are violated. . . . \u2019 (An) appellant has the burden of proof of showing the discriminatory pattern which might entitle him to relief: \u2018the validity of actions of taxing authorities is presumed; when assailed, the burden of proof is upon the complaining party\u2019.\u201d Fisher Controls, supra. (Citations omitted) (Emphasis added).\nIn the case at bar, appellant does not challenge the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the policy enunciated in Taxing Memorandum No. 83 was applied uniformly during the period of time that the Memorandum was in effect. Further, appellant has offered no evidence that the director of the State Bureau of Corporation Taxes acted in bad faith or had any purpose which could be considered fraudulent. Viewed in the worst light, Taxing Memorandum No. 83 was no more than a mistake which was corrected by the director when he rescinded the Memorandum after it was in operation for thirteen months. Clearly, appellant has not met its burden of proving \u201cdeliberate, purposeful discrimination\u201d by the Commonwealth in enforcing the Act.\nAppellant\u2019s fourth contention is similar to its third in that appellant alleges that the Commonwealth violated the equal protection and uniformity clauses since, subsequent to the rescission of Taxing Memorandum No. 83, two major corporations of comparable size to appellant were granted a deduction on their state returns for foreign taxes that were claimed as a credit on their Federal returns. In positing this argument, appellant ignores the fact that the two corporations received their deductions as part of out-of-court settlements reached between the Commonwealth and the corporations. Under Section 3420h of the Act, the Commonwealth had the power to enter such tax settlements with corporations.\nEven if the Commonwealth erred in allowing the two corporations to deduct the foreign taxes, these isolated instances of taxpayers receiving deductions through the mistakes of the Commonwealth\u2019s employees should not serve as a justification for this Court\u2019s extention of relief and further mistake to appellant. The fact remains that \u201cno errors or misinformation of (the Commonwealth\u2019s) officers or agents can estop the government from collecting taxes legally due\u201d. Commonwealth v. Western Maryland Railway, 377 Pa. 312, 321, 105 A.2d 336, 341 (1954). Moreover, appellant failed to meet its burden of proving that the Commonwealth deliberately and purposefully discriminated against appellant.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nROBERTS and NIX, JJ., concurred in the result.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. This was pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 33.\n. Repealed by the Act of March 4, 1971, P.L. 86, No. 2, art. IV, \u00a7 411, 72 P.S. \u00a7 7411.\n. This Court approved this definition of \u201cnet income\u201d in Commonwealth v. Budd Co., 379 Pa. 159, 167, 108 A.2d 563, 566 (1954)."}
