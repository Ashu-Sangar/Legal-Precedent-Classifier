{"id": "1056636", "contents": "The judgment' of the Supreme Court was entered,\nPee Curiam.\n\u2014 The exemption claimed in this case falls-clearly \u2022within that clause of the Act of May 14th 1874, Pamph. L. 158, which exempts from taxation all \u201c associations and institutions of learning, benevolence or charity, with the grounds thereto annexed, and necessary for the occupancy and enjoyment of the same, founded, endorsed and maintained by public or private charity.\u201d This leaves the true question upon that clause of the 9th article of the new constitution, which authorizes the General Assembly to exempt \u201cinstitutions of purely public charity.\u201d On this, the pivot of the case, the opinion of the learned judge of the Common Pleas is so full, clear and accurate, we deem it unnecessary to add anything to what he has said so well.\nOne point, perhaps, we should notice. The word \u201cpurely\u201d must be interpreted so as to confine its qualification of a \u201cpublic charity\u201d to those institutions solely controlled and administered by the state herself, or so as to extend it to private institutions for purposes of purely public charity, and not administered for private gain. We prefer the latter interpretation, as declaring the true meaning of the constitution, and subserving best the public interest. On this point, in its application to the Library Company, the opinion of the learned judge fully sustains the claim of the company to be an institution of this character.\nDecree affirmed, with costs of the appeal, and the record ordered to be remitted for further proceedings."}
