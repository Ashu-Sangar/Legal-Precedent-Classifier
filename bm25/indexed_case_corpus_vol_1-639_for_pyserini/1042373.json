{"id": "1042373", "contents": "Mr. Justice Gordon\ndelivered the opinion of the court,\nThat the decree of the court in Michigan, divorcing Anson H. Platt from his wife, Mary W., was nugatory and void, so far, at least, as it affected the rights of parties in the state of Pennsylvania, is a proposition that is not open to doubt. The cause of divorce did not arise in the state of Michigan, neither did the parties reside therein. Mrs. Platt was not served with process, neither did she appear to answer the libel. Under these circumstances, we cannot recognise this decree of divorce as binding on the appellee: Colvin v. Reed, 5 P. F. Smith 375; Reel v. Elder, 12 Id. 308. The auditor was therefore correct in recognising the right of Mary W. Platt to the share of her husband\u2019s estate accorded to her, as his widow, by our intestate laws. On the authority, however, of Spier\u2019s Appeal, 2 Casey 234, Odiorne\u2019s Appeal, 4 P. F. Smith 178, and Hetrick v. Hetrick, 5 Id. 292, we dissent from the auditor\u2019s award, to her of the $300, under the Act of 1851. At the time of Platt\u2019s death, she was a resident of Michigan; so far as anything appears to the contrary, her separation from her husband was voluntary, nor does it appear, as in Terry\u2019s Case, 5 P. F. Smith 344, that by any method she maintained the family relation as far as was in her power. Such being the case, the $300 must be stricken out of the distribution to her.\nDecree reversed."}
