{"id": "1003451", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nThe question involved is: \u201cWhether under the will of the decedent the principal sum of $2,000 should be paid unto the appellant, Carlotta H. Browne, absolutely, or only the income thereof during her life-time.\u201d\nAlexina B. Eudman died June 17,1910, leaving a will wherein she devised her residuary estate in trust to \u201cdivide and pay over the same subject to my directions as hereinafter mentioned......and to pay unto my several heirs the interest and income, according to their respective shares as follows, viz: To Victoria A. Browne two thousand dollars, the interest or income to be paid to her, during her natural life, and immediately after her decease, the principal sum or income thereof to be paid to my niece Carlotta H. Browne, during her lifetime, in the event of her death to be equally divided between my nieces Emma R. Allmendinger and Bertha R. Browne.\u201d\nThe appellant claims the fund absolutely; but the court below decided that she took only a life-interest, stating, \u201cWe construe this testatrix\u2019s will as giving \u2018principal sum\u2019 of $2,000, after the death of Victoria A. Browne, to Carlotta H. Browne, upon the entry by her of security for the protection of the remainder interests ......, or the \u2018income\u2019 thereof to Carlotta H. Browne, in the event that the fund is paid to a trustee. No other interpretation would give effect to the words \u2018during her life-time,\u2019 and those words qualify the testatrix\u2019s gift to Carlotta H. Browne......The court is bound to give effect to every word without change or rejection, if any effect can be given not inconsistent with the general effect of the whole instrument......It is quite true ......that the phrase, \u2018in the event of her death,\u2019 if it followed an absolute gift in the first instance would be construed to refer to death in the life-time of the testator or prior beneficiary......; but in this case it follows a restricted gift and if interpreted literally does not conflict with the words limiting the estate of Carlotta H. Browne, to a life:estate.\u201d The court accordingly awarded the fund to Carlotta H. Browne \u201cduring her life upon her entering security......to protect the remainder interests\u201d; and further ordered that upon-a failure to enter security, the fund should be held by a trustee under the will of Alexina B. Rudman, in trust, \u201cto pay the net income thereof to Carlotta H. Browne during her life......\u201d\nWe are not convinced of error in the construction placed upon this will by the court below, and we feel that the award is amply vindicated in the above excerpt from the opinion of its learned president judge.\nThe assignments of error are overruled, and the decree is affirmed at the cost of the appellant."}
