The issue, as stated by Petitioner, is:\nDid the courts below err by concluding that a defendant who provides an address and subsequently becomes homeless has no duty to comply with the registration requirements of Megan\u2019s Law, such that evidence consistent with these circumstances would be insufficient to support a verdict of guilty of failure to register?\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter."}
