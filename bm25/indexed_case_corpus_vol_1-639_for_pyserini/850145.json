{"id": "850145", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis action of assumpsit was brought to collect the frontage charges against defendant\u2019s property on Hamilton street, for the construction of a sewer in said street, as set forth in plaintiff\u2019s statement. The only assigned cause of demurrer is: \u201c No personal claim exists for the alleged debt, but the law gives therefor only an action in rem against the land.\u201d The .court below .evidently.-thought, witb the defendant^ that the collection of such municipal claims, by a personal action against the owner of the abutting property, was unauthorized, and judgment for the defendant was accordingly entered. We have not been referred to any act of assembly that authorizes the collection of such claims otherwise than by the familiar proceeding in rem. Neither of the specifications of error is sustained.\nJudgment affirmed."}
