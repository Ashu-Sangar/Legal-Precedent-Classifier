{"id": "4276334", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 30th day of December, 2014, the Court being evenly divided, the Order of the Superior Court is AFFIRMED.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files an opinion in support of affirmance in which Justices BAER and TODD join.\nJustice SAYLOR files an opinion in support of reversal.\nJustice EAKIN files an opinion in support of reversal in which Justice STEVENS joins.\nChief Justice CASTILLE,\nin support of affirmance.\nThis discretionary appeal concerns the proper manner in which cell phone text messages can be authenticated and whether and when such messages are inadmissible hearsay. The trial court admitted the messages as sufficiently authenticated and not hearsay; the Superior Court reversed on both grounds in a unanimous published opinion that ordered a new trial. This Court accepted the Commonwealth\u2019s appeal, but has evenly divided. For the reasons set forth below, we would affirm.\nOn March 14 and 24, 2009, North Middleton Township Police Officer Richard Grove and another officer, acting on suspicion that unlawful controlled substances were present and that drug sales activity was being transacted, conducted \u201ctrash pulls\u201d of discarded garbage at a residence lived in by Amy Koch (appellee), her boyfriend, Dallas Conrad, and her brother, Norman Koch, also known as \u201cMatt.\u201d Appellee\u2019s brother was the original target of the officers\u2019 suspicions after a confidential informant indicated that he was living at the residence and selling cocaine from his car. Based upon evidence recovered from the trash pulls, including plastic \u201cbaggies\u201d containing residue of both cocaine and marijuana, the police obtained a search warrant, which was served and executed at appellee\u2019s residence on March 25, 2009, by Officer Grove and North Middleton Township Police Detective Timothy Lively. During the search, the officers found two baggies, each containing roughly ten grams of marijuana, and $700 cash in the drawer of a dresser in the master bedroom; in a shoebox on top of the same dresser, the officers found a used \u201cbong,\u201d two marijuana pipes, a grinder (commonly used to separate marijuana seeds and stems from the leaves that are smoked), an open package of \u201cPhilly Blunts,\u201d empty baggies of various sizes, and the \u201cend portion of a joint.\u201d Searching the basement of the residence, the officers found a small bag of marijuana inside a freezer and a \u201cbud\u201d of marijuana in a small woven basket.\nDuring the search, the officers also found a used marijuana pipe and an electronic scale covered with marijuana residue on top of the refrigerator in the kitchen. Detective Lively looked for cell phones in the residence because drug dealers and users commonly use cell phones to communicate and arrange transactions. He seized two cell phones, one of which he found on the kitchen table near where appellee was during the search; appellee asked him several times \u201cwhy her cell phone was being taken.\u201d Appellee was arrested, along with Dallas Conrad and Norman Koch.\nAfter obtaining a warrant, Detective Lively searched for drug-related communications and information on appellee\u2019s cell phone. He read text messages stored on the phone, both sent and received, and transcribed the messages that he considered to be indicative of drug sales activity. These included the following outgoing messages, which were sent between March 15 and 21, 2009:\nTo \u201cPam\u201d: \u201cI got a nice gram of that gd Julie to get rid of dude didn\u2019t have enuff cash so I had 2 throw in but I can\u2019t keep it 8og.\u201d\nTo \u201cMatt\u201d: \u201cCan I get that other o from u\u201d\nTo \u201cTiff\u2019: \u201cSorry I didn\u2019t wait I wanted 2 smoke but call me then if u r cuming out.\u201d\nTo \u201cPam\u201d: \u201cNot lookn good on my end can u get a g 4 me\u201d To \u201cPam\u201d: \u201cno go 2 nite he only could split a ball w me but I got a new hook up and its cheap\u201d\nTo \u201cBrian\u201d: \u201cCall me I nd trees\u201d\nTo \u201cPam\u201d: \u201cIf do happen to cum across any 2 nite let me know this is not that gr8\u201d\nDetective Lively subsequently testified at trial that he believed these messages reflected drug sales activity due to references he understood from his training and experience: \u201cJulie\u201d refers to cocaine, an \u201c0\u201d is an ounce of drugs, \u201cG\u201d is a gram of drugs, \u201ctrees\u201d refers to marijuana, and a \u201cball\u201d is about 3.33 grams of cocaine, a common quantity about the size of a pool ball, which is also referred to as an \u201ceight ball.\u201d\nAlong similar lines, Detective Lively transcribed the following incoming messages that were received on appellee\u2019s phone between March 18 and 21, 2009:\nFrom \u201cTam\u201d: \u201cwas wondering if u could hook me up then after work\u201d\nFrom \u201cTam\u201d: \u201ccool I neED a half r u gonna text me then\u201d\nFrom \u201cTam\u201d: \u201ccool when did u want me to come out\u201d\nFrom \u201cPam\u201d: \u201clet me know asap\u201d\nFrom \u201cPam\u201d: [17 minutes later] \u201csweet how much?\u201d\nFrom \u201cPam\u201d: [3 minutes later] \u201cK\u201d\nFrom \u201cPam\u201d: [45 minutes later] \u201cwell?\u201d\nFrom \u201cPam\u201d: [1 minute later] \u201ck\u201d\nFrom \u201cPam\u201d: [33 minutes later] \u201chey u\u201d\nFrom \u201cPam\u201d: [6 minutes later] \u201ccan u part with any?\u201d\nFrom \u201cPam\u201d: [2 minutes later] \u201ctks tree looks good\u201d\nDetective Lively interpreted the messages from \u201cTam\u201d as drug-related, understanding \u201ca half\u2019 to mean some manner in which drugs are measured, such as a half an ounce of marijuana, and the terms \u201chook me up\u201d and \u201ccome out\u201d to be arrangements for a sale. Likewise, Detective Lively concluded that the messages from \u201cPam\u201d reflected a request for a price and, ultimately, a successful deal made for marijuana (\u201ctree\u201d) nearly two hours later the same night.\nIn light of the foregoing, along with the physical evidence recovered from the search, appellee was charged with felony possession with intent to deliver (PWID) marijuana, both as a principal and an accomplice; criminal conspiracy with regard to the PWID charge; and unlawful possession (of marijuana), a misdemeanor. Dallas Conrad\u2019s case was severed from appellee\u2019s prior to trial, and Norman Koch\u2019s case concluded after a preliminary hearing during which he pled guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia, leaving appellee the only defendant to stand trial.\nAt appellee\u2019s jury trial in May 2010, the Commonwealth called Officer Grove, who testified to the physical evidence of drug activity-marijuana, cash, baggies, and scales \u2014 that was found during the search; a forensic chemistry expert who confirmed that the confiscated substances were marijuana; and Detective Lively. When the prosecutor began to question Detective Lively about his interpretation of the text messages on appellee\u2019s cell phone, defense counsel, at sidebar, objected to the messages as hearsay, describing them as \u201cunreliable because the phone was shared between two people\u201d and protesting against the detective \u201cread[ing] a conversation between two people that have not been called as a witness [sic].... He cannot testify to th\u00e9 contents of ... a text message if he wasn\u2019t a party to it.\u201d The prosecutor responded that the messages were not hearsay because their import was only \u201cthat these things were said on this phone ... and that these [statements] would constitute drug receipts, drug statements, and orders.\u201d N.T., Trial, 5/26/10, at 10-75.\nThe court ruled that Detective Lively could testify about his impression of the messages on appellee\u2019s phone to show that, in the prosecutor\u2019s words, \u201c[appellee\u2019s] phone was used in drug transactions, and, therefore, it makes it more probable than not when [appellee] possessed this marijuana that she did so with the intent to deliver as opposed to personal use.\u201d Defense counsel reiterated his objection, arguing that admission of the contents of the messages invited speculation by the jury as to \u201cwho is making those calls,\u201d and was prejudicial to appellee in regards to both the PWID and conspiracy charges. The court overruled appellee\u2019s objection but agreed to provide a cautionary instruction based on the outcome of Detective Lively\u2019s testimony regarding the text messages. Id. at 76-79.\nThereafter, Detective Lively read aloud and discussed the text messages and his understanding that they were related to drug sales activity; the messages were referred to neutrally as appearing on \u201cthis phone\u201d as opposed to \u201cappellee\u2019s phone\u201d or to or from appellee herself. The detective\u2019s substantive testimony during direct examination focused on terms used in the text messages and his opinion of their drug-related meanings, such as \u201cg\u2019s\u201d and \u201co\u2019s\u201d for grams and ounces, \u201cJulie\u201d for cocaine, \u201cball\u201d for an \u201c8-ball\u201d of cocaine. Id. at 80-89.\nDuring cross-examination, appellee elicited the detective\u2019s admission that he had not followed up by attempting to contact the purported recipients and authors of the text messages, whose numbers were in the phone, in order to ascertain whether appellee or someone else was the correspondent. Id. at 105-06. During both direct and cross-examination, Detective Lively testified that although the messages were in a phone that appellee had asserted she owned, he could not determine whether appellee had been the correspondent in the purported drug sales messages. At least one outgoing message, although non-incriminating in its content, suggested that appellee was not the author of certain messages, since appellee was referred to in the third person in an exchange concerning a baked goods fundraiser: \u201cLet me know total, and I\u2019ll give [appellee] money 4 u.\u201d Id. at 82-84, 92,103-06, 128-29. Appellee did not take the stand in her own defense.\nThe jury convicted appellee of felony PWID (as an accomplice) and the misdemeanor possession charge (also as an accomplice), but found her not guilty of the conspiracy charge. Appellee filed a post-verdict motion challenging admission of the content of the text messages as inadmissible hearsay. The motion also reiterated appellee\u2019s objection regarding authorship of the messages, arguing that the messages were \u201cinherently unreliable as there is no competent way for a jury to decide which messages came from which sender \\ie., appellee or Dallas [Conrad]].\u201d Post-Verdict Motion, 6/4/10, at 2. The trial court denied appellee\u2019s post-verdict motion and sentenced her to 23 months of supervised probation. Appellee appealed to the Superior Court and filed a statement pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), again challenging admission at trial of the text messages as unauthenticated and hearsay, and also challenging the sufficiency and weight of the evidence supporting her convictions.\nIn its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) opinion, the trial court noted the dearth of contemporary Pennsylvania case law on the authentication of electronic and wireless communications, but then opined that the Commonwealth had presented sufficient circumstantial evidence to establish the authenticity of the messages, as required by Rule of Evidence 901 (\u201cAuthenticating or Identifying Evidence\u201d). According to the court, the possibility that someone other than appellee was the author of all, some, or any of the outgoing drug-sales-related text messages went to the weight of the evidence. Trial Ct. Op., 11/30/10, at 12-13.\nTurning to appellee\u2019s claim that the text messages were inadmissible hearsay, the trial court stated that the messages were not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but to demonstrate an operative fact of the crime of PWID\u2014 that appellee was sending and receiving communications intended to facilitate drug sales activity. The trial court finally addressed appellee\u2019s sufficiency and weight claims, stating that while the evidence was largely circumstantial, it was sufficient to support appellee\u2019s convictions and that the convictions were not against the weight of the evidence. Id. at 13-17.\nIn her brief to the Superior Court, appellee pursued both her sufficiency claim, arguing that the uncertain authorship of the text messages rendered the evidence insufficient to prove PWID, and her challenge to the admissibility of the text messages. Appellee also claimed that the text messages were improperly admitted because: \u201cAlthough the District Attorney was clear that the text messages were not being offered for the truth of the matter asserted, once admitted into evidence, the jury was then left to guess at which if any text messages were sent and received by [appellee] and then speculate on whether or not [appellee] was involved with delivering narcotics. In addition, certain text messages were clearly evidencing drug transactions; it was not a coincidence that [appellee] was then convicted of [PWID].\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief to Superior Court, at 16-20. In response, the Commonwealth posited, as the trial court had, that questions of authorship of the text messages went to the weight of the evidence. Regarding appellee\u2019s hearsay claim, the Commonwealth hewed to its position that the messages were not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but rather to show appellee\u2019s intentional involvement in selling drugs, not through the messages\u2019 content, but by the fact that she was actively engaged in making arrangements using her cell phone. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief to Superior Court, 5/23/11, at 6-9.\nIn a unanimous published opinion authored by the Honorable Mary Jane Bowes, Commonwealth v. Koch, 39 A.3d 996 (Pa.Super.2011), the Superior Court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The panel agreed with the trial court that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, considered collectively, was sufficient to support the PWID conviction. Nevertheless, the panel agreed with appellee that the text messages should not have been admitted at trial, and the error was not harmless; thus, a new trial was warranted. Id. at 1001-07.\nThe panel believed that the question of what proof is necessary to authenticate a text message raised an issue of first impression in Pennsylvania and began its inquiry by looking to cases involving other forms of electronic communication, such as instant messages, which were at issue in In re F.P., 878 A.2d 91 (Pa.Super.2005). Briefly, in F.P., the Superi- or Court concluded that sufficient evidence existed to authenticate and admit transcripts of instant message exchanges between F.P. and his assault victim. F.P. referred to himself by his first name in the exchanges and did not deny sending them during a school mediation; in addition, details in the transcripts foretold specifics about the dispute and the assault on the victim. Id. at 93-95. Notably, the F.P. panel recognized the difficulty in authenticating electronic communications and the dearth of applicable precedent, but declined to \u201ccreate a whole new body of law just to deal with e-mails or instant messages.\u201d Rather, the court opined: \u201cWe believe that e-mail messages and similar forms of electronic communication can be properly authenticated within the existing framework of Pa.R.E. 901 and Pennsylvania case law.\u201d Id. at 95-96.\nIn this case, the panel recognized that establishing authorship of a text message can be difficult without direct evidence or an admission by a correspondent, but that circumstantial evidence, if sufficient, is also acceptable, as a number of other states have held, including cases the panel cited from North Dakota, Maryland, Illinois, and North Carolina. Although text messages are particular to the cell phone on which they are received or from which they are sent, the panel concluded that this fact alone is not sufficient, since it is simple enough for another person to use one\u2019s phone. And in this case, the Commonwealth\u2019s own witness, Detective Lively, agreed that authorship was unknown. The messages themselves did not contain any \u201ccontextual clues\u201d like those in F.P., and the mere fact that appellee admitted the phone itself was hers did not establish that she had been an active correspondent in these particular drug sales text messages. Thus, the panel concluded that authentication \u2014 the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that these messages were sent by appellee to arrange and plan drug sales \u2014 had not been established. Koch, 39 A.3d at 1003-05.\nThe panel decided that the text messages were also inadmissible as hearsay that was not offered for any reason other than to show the truth of the matter asserted by the Commonwealth as to the content of the messages \u2014 that appellee used her phone to conduct drug sales and therefore possessed marijuana with the intent to deliver it and not merely for personal use. The panel added that the improper admission of the messages was compounded by their being used as the basis for an expert opinion by Detective Lively that appellee was using her cell phone to arrange drug sales via text messaging. And, according to the panel, the messages could not be admitted under any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. The panel again concluded that admission of the unauthenticated hearsay messages was not harmless error: \u201cThe prejudicial effect of the improperly admitted text message evidence was so pervasive in tending to show that [appellee] took an active role in an illicit enterprise that it cannot be deemed harmless. Even with the improperly admitted evidence, the jury only found [appellee] liable as an accomplice.\u201d For this independent reason, the panel held that a new trial was required. Id. at 1005-07.\nThis Court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal, which challenged both of the evidence-related grounds for the Superior Court\u2019s grant of a new trial. Commonwealth v. Koch, 615 Pa. 612, 44 A.3d 1147 (2012).\nThe standard of review governing evidentiary issues is settled. The decision to admit or exclude evidence is committed to the trial court\u2019s sound discretion, and evidentiary rulings will only be reversed upon a showing that a court abused that discretion. A finding of abuse of discretion may not be made \u201cmerely because an appellate court might have reached a different conclusion, but requires a result of manifest unreasonableness, or partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will, or such lack of support so as to be clearly erroneous.\u201d Commonwealth v. Laird, 605 Pa. 137, 988 A.2d 618, 636 (2010) (citation and quotation marks omitted); see also Commonwealth v. Sanchez, 614 Pa. 1, 36 A.3d 24, 48 (2011). Matters within the trial court\u2019s discretion are reviewed on appeal under a deferential standard, and any such rulings or determinations will not be disturbed short of a finding that the trial court \u201ccommitted a clear abuse of discretion or an error of law controlling the outcome of the case.\u201d Commonwealth v. Chambers, 602 Pa. 224, 980 A.2d 35, 50 (2009) (jury instructions); see also Commonwealth v. Karenbauer, 552 Pa. 420, 715 A.2d 1086, 1095 (1998) (scope of cross-examination).\nI. Authentication\nWe address authentication first because, logically, it is the question precedent: if proffered evidence fails an authentication challenge, meaning that its proponent cannot prove that the evidence is what the proponent claims it to be, the evidence cannot be admitted, regardless of its potential relevance, and the hearsay query is not reached.\nThe Commonwealth argues that the Superior Court decision conflicts with Superior Court precedent, specifically the statement in In re F.P., 878 A.2d at 96, that: \u201c[w]e see no justification for constructing unique rules for admissibility of electronic communications such as instant messages; they are to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis as any other document to determine whether or not there has been an adequate foundational showing of their relevance and authenticity.\u201d To the Commonwealth, the panel decision here improperly elevates the standard for authentication of electronic communications, which often can only be established by recourse to circumstantial evidence, to \u201cprima facie plus.\u201d The Commonwealth also believes the panel misread Rule of Evidence 901 and \u201cinfused\u201d authentication with relevancy in a manner likely to have a far-ranging negative impact on prosecution of drug (and other) offenses where electronic communications are at issue. The Commonwealth asserts that while a communication from a physically nebulous source, such as an e-mail address or a phone number, may need additional circumstantial evidence to establish authenticity, this case involves a communication (text message) from an actual physical source (cell phone) that can be physically and directly attributed to the defendant (appellee). According to the Commonwealth, text messages require less support to be authenticated when the phone itself is available and part of the evidence. Here, the Commonwealth argues, there is no dispute that appellee claimed the actual phone was hers during the search, and when the messages were recovered from the phone, there was sufficient evidence of authorship by appellee to prove authentication. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 26-33.\nMoreover, the Commonwealth avers, proof of authorship of the messages here is not required because appellee was charged as both a principal and an accomplice; thus, the Commonwealth asserts, the crucial fact is not that appellee did or did not write, send, and receive the drug sales text messages, but that the actual physical phone she acknowledged to be hers was used in drug transactions. According to the Commonwealth, \u201c[t]he texts were not authenticated as ... authored by [appellee], but rather, as the prosecutor stated at trial: ... to show that [appellee\u2019s] phone was used in drug transactions,\u201d making it more probable than not that appellee was consciously involved in the subject drug sales. Id. at 33-38.\nAppellee disputes the claim that the panel\u2019s decision created an improperly heightened burden of proof. Appellee asserts that, pursuant to Rule 901, all parties must show that proposed evidence can be identified as genuinely what the proponent claims it to be, here, drug sales text messages sent and received by appellee on her personal cell phone. Appellee adds that, the Commonwealth\u2019s case for authentication of the text messages at trial revealed its own weakness when Detective Lively conceded that someone other than appellee likely authored at least some of the text messages. Appellee avers that the Commonwealth was not held to a higher or \u201cprima facie plus\u201d standard, but that it simply could not make a sufficient case to satisfy Rule 901 that appellee herself was the author of the incriminating text messages. Id. at 10-13.\nAppellee further asserts that mere possession of a cell phone does not prove authorship of text messages sent from that phone, and additional evidence to corroborate the identity of the sender, such as the context or content of the messages themselves, if unique to the parties involved, is needed for authentication. Appellee concludes by stating that the drug sales text messages in this case were never authenticated as having been written by her, even though they were \u201cin\u201d her phone, and the Superior Court properly found that their admission against her as proof of intent to deliver was reversible error by the trial court, warranting a new trial. Id. at 13-lb.\nAs both lower courts recognized, communications technology presents arguably novel questions with regard to evidentiary issues like authenticity and hearsay. It appears that there have been no further intermediate court developments in this specific area since the Superior Court\u2019s opinion in this case was published.\nPennsylvania Rule of Evidence 901, adopted as part of the Evidence Code promulgated in 1998, is titled \u201cAuthenticating or Identifying Evidence,\u201d and provides in relevant part:\n(a) In General. To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\n(b) Examples. The following are examples only-not a complete list-of evidence that satisfies the requirement:\n(1) Testimony of a Witness with Knowledge. Testimony that an item is what it is claimed to be.\n* * *\n(4) Distinctive Characteristics and the Like. The appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken together with all the circumstances.\nPa.R.E. 901(a) & (b). Thus, evidence that cannot be authenticated directly pursuant to subsection (1) may be authenticated by other parts of section (b) of the Rule, including circumstantial evidence pursuant to subsection (4). In the context of a communication, subsection (4)\u2019s \u201cdistinctive characteristics\u201d may include information tending to specify an author-sender, reference to or correspondence with relevant events that precede or follow the communication in question, or any other facts or aspects of the communication that signify it to be what its proponent claims. Commonwealth v. Collins, 598 Pa. 397, 957 A.2d 237, 265-66 (2008). Authentication generally entails a relatively low burden of proof; in the words of Rule 901 itself, simply \u201cevidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims.\u201d Pa.R.E. 901(a).\nThis Court has not yet spoken on the manner in which text messages may be authenticated where, as here, there is no first-hand corroborating testimony from either author or recipient. We are mindful, however, that the burden for authentication is low, and we agree with the Justices writing in support of reversal that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Commonwealth met the burden here, albeit we see the question as close, and we view authorship as a potentially relevant part of authentication analysis.\nAs a predicate matter, we also agree with the panel below that modern communications technology can present arguably novel questions with regard to evidentiary issues like authenticity and hearsay. A handful of states\u2019 high courts have spoken on this issue since 2007, when the Supreme Court of Rhode Island decided State v. McLaughlin, 935 A.2d 938 (R.I.2007). In that case, threatening text messages sent by the defendant to his girlfriend were admitted at his probation violation hearing, albeit with the caveat that \u201c[s]trict application of the rules of evidence is not required at a probation violation hearing.\u201d Id. at 942. The messages were authenticated by direct testimony from the recipient herself. Rodriguez v. State, 278 P.3d 845 (Nev.2012), involved incriminating text messages sent from the assault victim\u2019s cell phone, which had been stolen from her during the attack, to her boyfriend, who showed them to police detectives. After considering a number of cases from other states\u2019 courts, including the Superior Court\u2019s opinion in this case, Nevada\u2019s high court concluded:\n[Establishing the identity of the author of a text message through the use of corroborating evidence is critical to satisfying the authentication requirement for admissibility. We thus conclude that, when there has been an objection to admissibility of a text message, the proponent of the evidence must explain the purpose for which the text message is being offered and provide sufficient direct or circumstantial corroborating evidence of authorship in order to authenticate the text message as a condition precedent to its admission.\nId. at 849 (citations & footnote omitted). Other states\u2019 high courts also call for direct or circumstantial \u201ccorroborating evidence of authorship\u201d to authenticate text messages.\nOn the other hand, one state\u2019s highest court has taken a position more aligned with that of the trial court, which is that a text message may be authenticated with only the cell phone number and possession of the phone on which the message appears. See State v. Forde, 233 Ariz. 543, 315 P.3d 1200, 1220 (2014) (because both sender and recipient were registered subscribers of phone numbers and both possessed phones used to send and receive, prosecution met its authentication burden).\nIn this case, the trial court shared Arizona\u2019s simple and permissive approach, while the Superior Court panel below aligned itself with the growing number of jurisdictions that require at least some corroboration of authorship, whether direct or circumstantial. The authentication inquiry will, by necessity, be fact-bound and case-by-case, but, like courts in many other states, we believe that authorship is relevant to authentication, particularly in the context of text messages proffered by the government as proof of guilt in a criminal prosecution. This is not an elevated \u201cprima facie plus\u201d standard or imposition of an additional requirement. Rather, it is a reasonable contemporary means of satisfying the core requirement of Rule 901 when a text message is the evidence the Commonwealth seeks to admit against a defendant; the Commonwealth must still show that the message is what the Commonwealth claims it to be, and authorship can be a valid (and even crucial) aspect of the determination.\nHere, appellee admitted ownership of the cell phone, and other evidence from the Commonwealth showed that the content of the messages indicated drug sales activity. However, whether appellee was the author of the messages was not established by any evidence, either direct or circumstantial. Nevertheless, the burden for authentication is not high, and appellee was charged as both an accomplice and a conspirator in a drug trafficking enterprise. As such, authorship was not as crucial to authentication as it might be under different facts. For these reasons, we are satisfied that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the Commonwealth met its authentication burden as to the text messages.\nII. Hearsay\nIn our view, however, the Commonwealth cannot have it both ways when it comes to appellee\u2019s separate and related challenge that the substance of the text messages was inadmissible hearsay. Of course, the concepts of inadmissible hearsay and non-hearsay, which can be admissible, are well-known evidentiary principles:\nHearsay, which is a statement made by someone other than the declarant while testifying at trial and is offered into evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted, is normally inadmissible at trial.... In the alternative, out-of-court statements may be admissible because they are non-hearsay, in which case they are admissible for some relevant purpose other than to prove the truth of the matter asserted. See Commonwealth v. [Raymond] Johnson, 576 Pa. 23, 838 A.2d 663, 680 (2003) (defendant\u2019s statements threatening witness\u2019s family admissible as verbal acts, a form of non-hearsay, because evidence not offered to establish truth of matter asserted, but rather, to demonstrate fact of attempted .influencing of witness); Commonwealth v. Puksar, 559 Pa. 358, 740 A.2d 219, 225 (1999) (statements by witness who overheard defendant and his brother (the victim) arguing were admissible as non-hearsay because not offered to prove truth of matter asserted, but rather to establish motive for killings).\nCommonwealth v. Ali, 608 Pa. 71, 10 A.3d 282, 315-16 (2010) (quotation marks & some citations omitted). When this type of evidence is in question, the distinction can be subtle between a statement that, if admitted, would serve as affirmative and substantive evidence of the accused\u2019s guilt, and non-hearsay that may be admitted to establish some other aspect of a case, such as motive or a witness\u2019s relevant course of conduct. Commonwealth v. Busanet, 618 Pa. 1, 54 A.3d 35, 68-69 (2012); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 615 Pa. 354, 42 A.3d 1017, 1035 (2012). On appeal, reviewing courts should be wary of proffered bases for admission that may be pretexts for getting fact-bound evidence admitted for a substantive purpose. See Commonwealth v. Moore, 594 Pa. 619, 937 A.2d 1062, 1071-73 (2007) (victim\u2019s statements to father, sister, and friend concerning bullying by defendant were not admissible under state of mind hearsay exception: \u201cCommonwealth\u2019s allusions to the victim\u2019s state of mind in this passage and otherwise are tangential, and it is readily apparent that the state of mind hearsay exception was used as a conduit to support the admission of fact-bound evidence to be used for a substantive purpose.\u201d).\nThe Commonwealth argues here, as it did below, that the message contents were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but as \u201cdrug-related records\u201d of the sort found admissible in Commonwealth v. Glover, 399 Pa.Super. 610, 582 A.2d 1111, 1113 (1990) (book recording dates and sums of money \u201cwas not offered to prove the truth of the sums and dates it contained, only that these types of records were kept and were in the possession of Glover. A written statement is not hearsay if offered to prove that it was made rather than its truth. This book was offered to show that it existed and was found in Glover\u2019s room; as offered, it is not hearsay.\u201d) (citation omitted). The Commonwealth also relies upon Commonwealth v. Murphy, 418 Pa.Super. 140, 613 A.2d 1215, 1225 n. 11 (1992), a case involving charges of, inter alia, murder, criminal conspiracy, and corrupt organizations, which held that the challenged documents \u201cwere not \u2018business records\u2019 in the ordinary sense, offered to establish the actual workings of a business or to prove the truth of the dealings contained in them. Instead, the evidence was offered and received to show that the parties mentioned therein were associated with one another. See Commonwealth v. Glover .... \u201d\nThe Commonwealth also cites federal cases where \u201crecords\u201d allegedly like those represented here in the text messages on appellee\u2019s phone, were found to be admissible non-hearsay because the evidence simply established the accused\u2019s relationship with other individuals in an illegal conspiracy or operation. In the alternative, the Commonwealth argues, the messages here were not hearsay because they were admissible as the statements of co-conspirators or co-participants in a crime, pursuant to Rule of Evidence 803(25)(E). Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 22-26.\nIn response, appellee argues that, \u201cin reality at trial,\u201d the messages here were obviously hearsay proffered (and wrongly admitted) solely for their content and truth. Appellee adds that the impropriety was compounded by the messages\u2019 use as a basis for the testimony by Detective Lively, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert. The purpose of the detective\u2019s testimony was to deconstruct and interpret the slang that was used in the messages \u2014 i.e., their very text \u2014 to explain to the jury what was said out of court in the messages. And, of course, it just so happened that what the detective discerned in the messages was evidence of the very crimes with which appellee was charged. Thus, the detective opined that the text messages evidenced drug sales in a manner that implicated appellee, even though the detective admitted he could not prove she had been a correspondent. Appellee distinguishes Glover because, in that case, the notebook containing dates and sums was described as only possibly (not surely) indicating drug sales activity and was proffered not to prove the truth of its contents, but to show only \u201cthat these types of records were kept and were in [Glover\u2019s] possession.\u201d 582 A.2d at 1113.\nAppellee further argues that the content of the text messages was offered and used by the Commonwealth at her trial purely to impress upon the jury that her possession of marijuana was with the intent to deliver; she asserts that without the \u201ctruth\u201d revealed in the messages, her conviction on the PWID charge, even as an accomplice, would have been unlikely. Appellee avers that the Commonwealth\u2019s expressed reason for seeking to submit the message contents (which clearly imply drug sales) to the jury, \u201cunder the guise\u201d that they were not being admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, was to prove her intent to deliver, and not merely to show the otherwise irrelevant fact that she just happened to own a phone that had messages on it referring to what a police expert thought were drug sales. Appellee\u2019s Brief at 5-9.\nTaking into account the foregoing arguments, we note the following. Lawyers with trial experience know that when a party has classic hearsay evidence that it knows is harmful to the opposing party, but cannot actually identify a theory to overcome exclusion on hearsay grounds, a common fallback position is to declare that the out-of-court statements are not being offered for their truth. Counsel in such circumstances recognize that if they can manage to get the evidence admitted this way, the party\u2019s cause will be advanced, irrespective of reliability or relevancy. But, the required analytical response to this facile fallback position is: if the hearsay is not being offered for its truth, then what exactly is its relevance? And, assuming some such tangential relevance, does the probative value of the evidence outweigh the potential for prejudice? In this case, the inquiry is not difficult because the only relevance of this evidence \u2014 drug sales text messages on appellee\u2019s cell phone \u2014 is precisely for the truth of the matter asserted, and we have little doubt that that is precisely how the lay jury construed it.\nAt trial, after appellee lodged her hearsay objection while Detective Lively was on the stand, the prosecutor responded that he was not- trying to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the messages, but wanted the detective to testify that he understood the messages to be similar to \u201cbuy sheets\u201d recording and arranging drug sales and to show that \u201cthese statements were on the phone that belonged to her and that\u2014 that these other types of statements then would constitute drug receipts, drug statements, and orders.\u201d The prosecutor later added: \u201c[T]he purpose of this evidence is to show that [appellee\u2019s] phone was used in drug transactions, and, therefore, it makes it more probable than not when the Defendant possessed this marijuana that she did so with the intent to deliver as opposed to personal use.\u201d N.T., Trial, 5/26/10, at 73-79 (emphasis supplied).\nThe trial prosecutor\u2019s candor should be determinative here. The prosecutor conceded that he sought to admit the message contents as substantive evidence probative of appellee\u2019s alleged intent to engage in drug sales activity. And that is certainly how the jury would construe the messages. It requires a suspension of disbelief to conclude that the messages had any relevance beyond their substantive and incriminating import, especially because they served as a platform for the crucial expert testimony of Detective Lively. Furthermore, as the panel below recognized, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence of appellee\u2019s intent to deliver, without the truth revealed in the messages (via the expert testimony of the detective), was negligible. Simply put, the messages were out-of-court statements that were relevant, and indeed proffered, for a purpose that depended upon the truth of their contents, as probative of appellee\u2019s alleged intent to deliver. Accordingly, appellee\u2019s hearsay objection had merit and, in light of the paucity of other evidence that she possessed illegal drugs with the intent to deliver, the trial court\u2019s abuse of discretion in admitting the message contents was not harmless error.\nIn closing, we note that all sorts of inadmissible evidence may exist that might be helpful to a party\u2019s cause, and we understand the special incentive for the Commonwealth, in criminal cases, in perfect good faith, to attempt to make use of all the helpful \u201cevidence\u201d it may have. This is so because, unlike the defendant, the Commonwealth generally only gets one opportunity in a case; there is a very limited prospect of appeal. But, courts must remain mindful of those legal precepts that regulate unreliable evidence, in service of higher principles, such as the right to a fair trial.\nWe would affirm.\nJustices BAER and TODD join this opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR,\nin support of reversal.\nI am in alignment with Mr. Justice Eakin\u2019s Opinion in Support of Reversal relative to the authenticity issue, as well as its reasoning that the messages were properly authenticated as being drug-related and sent to and from Appellee\u2019s phone. Accordingly, I too would reverse the Superior Court. However, as to the authorship aspect of authentication, I have reservations with the notion that \u201cany question concerning the actual author or recipient of the text messages bore on the evidentiary weight to be afforded them.\u201d Opinion in Support of Reversal, at 401, 106 A.3d at 721 (Eakin, J., joined by Stevens, J.). In this regard, my view is closer to that expressed in Mr. Chief Justice Castille\u2019s Opinion in Support of Affirmance, namely, that authorship is a relevant consideration in most electronic communication authentication matters. See Opinion in Support of Affirmance, at 387-90, 106 A.3d at 712-13 (Castille, C.J.). As it concerns the present matter, my position in support of reversal is grounded in the Commonwealth\u2019s offer of the messages at trial, which did not rely on who drafted the messages (a fact that the Commonwealth readily conceded it could not demonstrate), but rather as circumstantial evidence of Appellee\u2019s complicity in dealing drugs in the same way that drug records or receipts may be relevant.\nAs it pertains to the hearsay question, I believe the reasoning advanced in Justice Eakin\u2019s Opinion in Support of Reversal is materially incomplete; it concludes, on the basis of one example \u2014 \u201ctree looks good\u201d-that all of the text messages were non-hearsay, since they were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Opinion in Support of Reversal, at 402-03, 106 A.3d at 722 (Ealdn, J.). In my view, this reliance on a single example overlooks the hearsay concerns implicated by other messages and fails to account for one text message that, indeed, was offered to prove its assertion.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s primary argument is that the text messages stored on Appellee\u2019s cell phone were offered into evidence, not for the truth of the matters asserted in them, but rather, solely to show that statements pertaining to illegal drugs were made utilizing Appellee\u2019s cell phone. In terms of the elements of the hearsay rule, the Commonwealth\u2019s position appears to be that the messages should not be regarded as containing any \u201cassertions\u201d at all, but rather, they merely reflect the subject matter of the participants\u2019 conversation (i.e., illegal drugs). Pa.R.E. 801(a) (defining \u201cstatement,\u201d for purposes of the rule against hearsay, in terms of assertive verbal or non-verbal conduct).\nThe rule against hearsay and the expansive scheme of exceptions that has evolved around it have been roundly criticized on various fronts. See, e.g., Irving Younger, ABA Section of Litigation Monograph Series No. 3, An Irreverent Introduction to Hearsay 18-19 (ABA Press 1977) (\u201cI put to you that any rule which begins by telling us that hearsay is not admissible, but which ends with a dozen major exceptions and a list of about a hundred exceptions all told, is not much of a rule.\u201d); id. at 20 (describing the author\u2019s practice of arranging the hearsay exceptions \u201cin ascending order of absurdity\u201d); Edmund M. Morgan & John M. Maguire, Looking Backward and Forward at Evidence, 50 Harv. L.Rev. 909, 921 (1937) (positing that the exceptions to the hearsay rule resemble \u201can old-fashioned crazy quilt made of patches cut from a group of paintings by cubists, futurists and surrealists\u201d). Putting aside controversies about the exceptions, the general hearsay rule itself is problematic on account of the difficulty in distinguishing between speech which is assertive and that which is to be regarded as non-assertive. See 4 Jones on Evidence \u00a7 24.12 n. 40 (7th ed. 2013) (\u201cNo authoritative single definition of the distinction between assertive and nonassertive verbal conduct exists.\u201d (quoting Roger C. Park, \u201cI Didn\u2019t Tell Them About You\u201d: Implied Assertions as Hearsay Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, 74 Minn. L.Rev. 783, 794 (1990))).\nFor example, speech often contains underlying information or assumptions in the nature of implied assertions, and courts and rulemakers in various jurisdictions have taken differing approaches to these. Much of the older common law would seem to hold that implied assertions are hearsay, at least where used to prove the truth of the matter to be taken as impliedly asserted. In this regard, English courts seem to recognize that conversations similar to those presently in issue implicate the rule against hearsay on the basis that they contain implied assertions. Along these lines, in Regina v. Kearley, [1992] 2 A.C. 228 (H.L.) (U.K.), a jurist discussed the implied assertions in one such conversation as follows:\n[The government] frankly concedes that if the inquirer had said in the course of making his request \u201cI would like my usual supply of amphetamine at the price which I paid you last week\u201d or words to that effect, then although the inquirer could have been called to give evidence of the fact that he had in the past purchased from the appellant his requirement of amphetamine and had made his call at the appellant\u2019s house for a further supply on the occasion when he met and spoke to the police, the hearsay rule prevents the prosecution from calling police officers to recount the conversation which I have described. This is for the simple reason that the request made in the form set out above contains an express assertion that the premises at which the request was being made was being used as a source of supply of drugs and the supplier was the appellant.\nIf, contrary to the view which I have expressed above, the simple request or requests for drugs to be supplied by the appellant, as recounted by the police, contains in substance, but only by implication, the same assertion, then I can find neither authority nor principle to suggest that the hearsay rule should not be equally applicable and exclude such evidence. What is sought to be done is to use the oral assertion, even though it may be an implied assertion, as evidence of the proposition asserted. That the proposition is asserted by way of necessary implication rather than expressly cannot, to my mind, make any difference.\nRegina v. Kearley, [1992] 2 A.C. 228 (H.L.) 254-55 (Ackner, J.) (U.K.) (emphasis added), quoted in David E. Seidelson, Implied Assertions and Federal Rule of Evidence 801: A Continuing Quandary for Federal Courts, 16 Miss. C.L.Rev. 33, 50-51 (1995); cf United States v. McGlory, 968 F.2d 309, 332 (3d Cir.1992) (explaining, in the implied assertion context, that the court \u201cdisfavored the admission of statements which are not technically admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, whenever the matter asserted, without regard to its truth value, implies that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged.\u201d).\nIn the United States, however, a strong countercurrent has emerged, as reflected in an advisory committee note to the Federal Rules of Evidence (upon which, notably, the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence were, in large part, modeled). According to the advisory committee,\nThe effect of the definition of \u201cstatement\u201d is to exclude from the operation of the hearsay rule all evidence of conduct, verbal or nonverbal, not intended as an assertion. The key to the definition is that nothing is an assertion unless intended to be one....\n... Similar considerations govern nonassertive verbal conduct and verbal conduct which is assertive but offered as a basis for inferring something other than the matter asserted, also excluded from the definition of hearsay by the language of subdivision (c).\nFed.R. Evid. 801 advisory committee\u2019s note; accord United States v. Boswell, 530 Fed.Appx. 214, 216 (4th Cir.2013) (taking the position that a text message containing a drug solicitation was non-hearsay); United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, 565 F.3d 312, 314-15 (6th Cir.2009) (holding that drug solicitations directed to a defendant\u2019s cell phone, answered by an arresting officer, were not hearsay).\nThe federal advisory committee\u2019s approach to the text of Federal Rule of Evidence 801 has been criticized as \u201clending] itself to a rigid literalism which can produce absurd results,\u201d and as \u201cignoring] how difficult it sometimes is to distinguish verbal conduct that is assertive from that which is nonassertive.\u201d 4 Jones on Evidence \u00a7 24.12; cf Christopher B. Mueller & Laird C. Kirkpatrick, 4 Fed. Evid. \u00a7 8.6 (4th ed.2013) (denoting a constrained approach to defining the boundaries of assertive verbal or non-verbal conduct as \u201calmost certainly wrong\u201d). Nevertheless, Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 801 is patterned after its federal analogue and, although the specific language from the federal advisory committee was not incorporated into the commentary, such comments reflect a categorical and literalistic approach which would appear to exclude implied assertions from the reach of the hearsay rule in a broad range of contexts. See, e.g., Pa.R.E. 801, cmt. (indicating that \u201cquestions, greetings, expressions of gratitude, exclamations, offers, instructions, warnings, etc.\u201d simply are not hearsay, without reference to the fact that such verbalizations may contain strong implied assertions).\nIn the present matter, Justice Eakin\u2019s Opinion in Support of Reversal concludes that the \u201cmessages were offered to demonstrate activity involving the distribution or intent to distribute drugs and the relationship between the parties sending and receiving the messages [and, thus] were not hearsay statements.\u201d Opinion in Support of Reversal, at 403, 106 A.3d at 722 (Eakin, J.) (citations omitted). As it pertains to the relationship aspect, I agree that the message sent from the phone to a number listed as \u201cMatt\u201d (identified as one of Appellee\u2019s alleged co-accomplices) was properly admitted as non-hearsay, since the relationship of the parties is demonstrated by the name of the contact (i.e., \u201cMatt\u201d) and not any assertion in the accompanying drug-related message, \u201ccan I get that other o from u.\u201d R.R. at 226.,\nRelative to the Commonwealth\u2019s proffer of the messages as evincing drug distribution, I would conclude that one message sent from the phone, \u201cI got a nice gram of that gd julie to get rid of dude didn\u2019t have enuff cash so I had to throw in but I cant keep it 8og,\u201d asserts the very matter for which it was offered. Id. The testifying detective explained that \u201cjulie\u201d is a reference to cocaine, and that the sender had used his own money to buy some cocaine, but needed to sell it. See N.T., May 26-27, 2010, at 85. Stated plainly, the assertion of this message is that the sender possesses drugs with the intent to sell them. Thus, the assertion is the same as what the Commonwealth attempted to prove true, namely, possession with the intent to distribute an illegal substance. In my view, this corresponds to the commonly understood definition of hearsay as an \u201cout-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Pa.R.E. 801, cmt.\nOn the whole, it may be worth considering refinements to our evidentiary rules based on accumulating wisdom and reflection. For the present, however, I do not believe the hearsay rule in Pennsylvania operates to preclude the admission into evidence of implied assertions such as those arising from at least the majority of the text messages in issue here. Thus, I am of the view that, although one message was improperly admitted, the other drug-related messages and the other circumstantial evidence of drug distribution obviate the need for a new trial under the harmless error standard. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 576 Pa. 23, 41-42, 838 A.2d 663, 674 (2003) (explaining that an error in admitting hearsay evidence is harmless where such evidence is cumulative of other untainted, substantially similar evidence). Accordingly, I would reverse the Superior Court\u2019s order relative to the hearsay issue.\nJustice EAKIN,\nin support of reversal.\nI agree with the Opinion in Support of Affirmance that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining the Commonwealth met its burden as to the text messages. However, I write separately because I disagree with the view that authorship is a relevant part of authentication analysis. See Opinion in Support of Affirmance, at 387-88, 106 A.3d at 712-13. I also disagree that the text messages were hearsay.\nRegarding authentication, Rule 901 requires only that the proponent of the item establish it is what he claims it is. See Pa.R.E. 901(a). As the Commonwealth established the criminal content of the text messages and the ownership of the cell phone, the threshold requirement for authentication was met, and any question concerning the actual author or recipient of the text messages bore on the evidentiary weight to be afforded to them. See Trial Court Opinion, 11/30/10, at 13 (\u201c[TJhere was sufficient circumstantial evidence to authenticate the cellular phone as belonging to [appellee], and sufficient authenticity of the messages contained therein. The possibility that a person other than [appellee] was the author of the drug-related text messages went ... to the weight of the evidence rather than admissibility of the messages.\u201d). Respectfully, I believe the Opinion in Support of Affirmance mistakenly conflates authentication and authorship; the latter is not a requirement of the former under the Rule or the facts of this case. Authorship may be pertinent to the value of the evidence, but it is not a part of authenticating it.\nI also disagree that modern communications technology can present \u201cnovel questions\u201d with regard to authentication issues and that the authentication inquiry must be fact-bound and case-by-case. See Opinion in Support of Affirmance, at 387-88, 389-90, 106 A.3d at 712-13, 714. There is no reason to analyze these electronic messages differently than a \u201ctraditional\u201d handwritten note; there is no need for a new rule of law for authentication simply because recordation is electronic. Rule 901 rightly requires evidence that an item such as a note, be it electronic or quill on papyrus, is what the proponent of the item says it is. The logic of authentication does not change with the nature of the message or its recording, and the mysteries of ever-changing technology offer no reason to change venerable legal concepts and principles in response.\nApplication of the principles can be adaptable, but the principles are unchanging. We cannot alter our manner of review every time there is new technology \u2014 technology changes every day, but the rules under which we operate, having the firmness of integrity in the first place, cannot ebb and flow with the perpetual creation of new manifestations to which they must be applied. The Rule, and the standards behind it, will accommodate the appropriate consideration of new technology. What must advance is our understanding of it, and we should not essay to reinvent the process because the details are electrons on a screen instead of paper and pencil. The factors that may bear on the evidentiary value of a message may vary with the nature of its recording, but relevance is a very discrete notion from authentication.\nRegarding hearsay, Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 802 provides: \u201cHearsay is not admissible except as provided by these rules, by other rules prescribed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, or by statute.\u201d Pa.R.E. 802. \u201cHearsay\u201d is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Id., 801(c). A \u201cstatement,\u201d as pertinent to this instance, is an oral or written assertion, id., 801(a), and a \u201cdeclarant\u201d is a person who makes a statement, id., 801(b). Thus, any \u201cout[-]of[-]court statement offered not for its truth but to explain the witness\u2019s course of conduct is not hearsay.\u201d Commonwealth v. Rega, 593 Pa. 659, 933 A.2d 997, 1017 (2007) (citing Commonwealth v. Sneed, 514 Pa. 597, 526 A.2d 749, 754 (1987)).\nIn the instant case, the text messages were not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted \u2014 i.e., that the \u201ctree look[ed] good[.]\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 11/30/10, at 9. Rather, the messages were offered to demonstrate activity involving the distribution or intent to distribute drugs and the relationship between the parties sending and receiving the messages. See Commonwealth v. Murphy, 418 Pa.Super. 140, 613 A.2d 1215, 1225 n. 11 (1992) (business papers, receipt books, and other memoranda were not hearsay because they were offered only \u201cto show that the parties mentioned therein were associated with one another\u201d (citation omitted)); Commonwealth v. Glover, 399 Pa.Super. 610, 582 A.2d 1111, 1113 (1990) (book noting dates and sums of money was not hearsay because it was offered \u201conly [to show] that these types of records were kept and were in the possession of [the defendant]\u201d). The trial court properly admitted the text messages because they were not hearsay statements. Accordingly, I would reverse the decision of the Superior Court and reinstate appellee\u2019s judgment of sentence.\nJustice STEVENS joins this opinion.\n. Respectively, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30), 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 306, id. \u00a7 903(a)(1), and 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(16).\n. The Rule states: \"(a) In General. To satisfy the requirement of authenticating or identifying an item of evidence, the proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\u201d Pa.R.E. 901(a).\n. Subsection (b) provides ten ways that evidence can be authenticated and states clearly that these are simply examples, not a complete list.\n. Or, as the case may be, the recipient, although in practice, the question almost invariably concerns authorship.\n. Gulley v.

The testifying detective explained that \"tree\u201d is code for marijuana. See N.T., May 26-27, 2010, at 87.\n. Parenthetically, in its present brief, the Commonwealth advances the theory that, even if the text messages in issue amount to hearsay, they were admissible under various exceptions to the hearsay rule, including those pertaining to admissions and coconspirator\u2019s statements. See Pa.R.E. 803(25). These bases, however, do not appear to have been advanced in the trial and intermediate courts and, in any event, are plainly outside the scope of the issues on which appeal was allowed by this Court. See Commonwealth v. Koch, 615 Pa. 612, 44 A.3d 1147 (2012) (per curiam).\n. Consistent with these criticisms, and in a factual context similar to the present case, one court reasoned as follows:\nThe text messages here purport to be expressions of a desire to engage in a drug transaction. This is a drug case. We therefore disagree with the State that the text messages were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted.\nBlack v. State, 358 S.W.3d 823, 831 (Tex.Ct.App.2012). Some commentators also express the concern that implied assertions arguably impose higher risks of inaccuracy and ambiguity than direct ones. See, e.g., State v. Palmer, 229 Ariz. 64, 270 P.3d 891, 900-01 (Ct.App.2012) (Eckstrom, P.J., dissenting) (collecting articles).\n. While our rules, in this regard, may appear to be vulnerable to the criticism that they are more reflexive than analytical, it should be noted that trial judges are invested with discretion to exclude evidence (including statements containing implied assertions), where the probative value is outweighed by dangers of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading jurors. See Pa.R.E. 403.\n. In any event, the message is phrased as a question, which, as explained by the comments to Rule 801, means that it is not an assertion and, thus, not hearsay. See Pa.R.E. 801, cmt. (\"Communications that are not assertions are not hearsay. These would include questions, greetings, expressions of gratitude, exclamations, offers, instructions, warnings, etc.\").\n. The detective explained that \"o\u201d is a reference to an ounce, a commonly used weight measurement for illicit drugs. See N.T., May 26-27, 2010, at 86.\n. In such an undertaking, however, it would also be worth considering the perspective that implied assertions arising out of performance-based or instrumental verbal conduct (such as drug solicitations) should be treated as non-hearsay, at least where the assertive quality of the speech fairly can be viewed as subordinate to the instrumental aspect. See, e.g., Mueller & Kirkpatrick, 4 Fed. Evid. \u00a7 8:24; accord People v. Morgan, 125 Cal.App.4th 935, 23 Cal.Rptr.3d 224, 229-30 (2005) (treating drug-solicitation text messages as primarily conduct-based as opposed to assertive)."}
