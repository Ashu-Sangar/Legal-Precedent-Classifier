{"id": "12280326", "contents": "OPINION\nJUSTICE TODD.\nIn this appeal by allowance, we consider whether, in order to facilitate the termination of a biological father\u2019s parental rights, a grandfather may adopt his grandchildren with the children\u2019s mother \u2014 his daughter. For the reasons that follow, we find the \u201ccause\u201d exception in Section 2901 of the Adoption Act, 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2901, does not, under such circumstances, excuse a mother from the Act\u2019s requirement that she relinquish her parental rights. Accordingly, as the contemplated adoption cannot proceed, we reverse the order affirming the termination of the father\u2019s parental rights.\nBy way of background, M.D. (\u201cMother\u201d) met M.C. (\u201cFather\u201d) in 2002, when she was teaching in South Dakota, and the two became romantically involved, residing together until Mother returned to Pennsylvania in October 2003. Father briefly moved to Pennsylvania in January 2004 to be with Mother; however, the relationship quickly ended, and he ultimately returned to South Dakota. Shortly thereafter, Mother learned that she was pregnant with twin boys, and she moved in with her parents, who resided in Lycoming County. Although Father was aware that Mother was pregnant with his children, Father and Mother spoke infrequently throughout the pregnancy, and he did not visit.\nIn October 2004, Mother gave birth to M.R.D. and T.M.D. (\u201cChildren\u201d). Father visited for a few days following Children\u2019s birth and returned for visits in December 2004 and January 2006; however, Father did not visit again, and his subsequent efforts at maintaining a relationship with Children were marginal at best. Indeed, in February 2006, when Mother discussed the possibility of traveling with Children to South Dakota to visit with Father and his family, Father refused. Father provided no financial support after his January 2006 visit, and he sent Children no written correspondence after January 2007. Additionally, although Father called Mother in the spring of 2007, he sounded intoxicated, and Mother subsequently changed her telephone number to an unlisted number. Mother had no contact with Father after his last telephone call.\nIn 2009, despite having had no contact with Mother or Children for several years, Father, who is now married and has a family of his own, spoke with an attorney to discuss pursuing custody of Children. Although Father did not initially take any legal action, three years later, he attempted to contact Mother in November 2012 by leaving a voicemail at her place of employment. The voicemail did not mention Children, and Mother did not return the call. Father filed for custody of Children the next month.\nBy stark contrast, Mother\u2019s father, M.D. (\u201cGrandfather\u201d), has been a significant part of Children\u2019s lives since their birth, assuming a father-like role beyond that of a typical grandfather and regularly sharing parental duties with Mother. Indeed, according to the orphans\u2019 court,\nGrandfather has played a regular role in decision making in the boys[\u2019] lives. Grandfather attended school conferences and has dealt with discipline issues as a team with Mother. Grandfather ha[s] traveled to doctor\u2019s appointments] with Mother. Grandfather and Mother have co-parented [Children.] Grandfather vacations with the boys. Grandfather assists in homework. Grandfather has disciplined the boys. Grandfather attends school functions with the boys. Grandfather has taken the boys to his place of employment and regularly along on jobs.... Grandfather has been [Children\u2019s] de facto father since birth.... Grandfather and Mother together have raised the boys. Grandfather\u2019s role in the children\u2019s lives extends far beyond the role of a typical grandparent. Grandfather is clearly one half of the parental unit that has raised the children. Grandfa- . ther\u2019s authority, control and influence over the children is equal to that of Mother.\nOrphans\u2019 Court Opinion, 8/19/13, at 4. Grandfather\u2019s close relationship with Children continued even after Mother moved out of her parents\u2019 home in August 2006, and he has provided significant financial support to Mother, allowing Mother to live free of charge in his other home, also located in Lycoming County.\nIn response to Father\u2019s custody action, Mother and Grandfather filed a Petition for Involuntary Termination of Parental Rights and Adoption on January 29, 2013, and an amended petition on February 28, 2013. Therein, Mother and Grandfather argued that Father\u2019s parental rights over Children should be terminated pursuant to Section 2511 of the Adoption Act because Father had evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing his parental claims over Children and refused to perform parental duties for seven years. With regard to the Act\u2019s requirement that the termination petition be filed in contemplation of an adoption, see 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2512(b), Mother and Grandfather also averred that they anticipated that Grandfather would adopt Children and co-parent with Mother.\nThe orphans\u2019 court conducted a hearing on the petition on August 13, 2013. In support of their petition, Mother and Grandfather testified regarding Grandfather\u2019s extensive involvement with Children and Father\u2019s concomitant lack of involvement in Children\u2019s lives, noting that Children, then almost 10 years old, did not know that Father existed until shortly before the hearing. Additionally, Mother explained that, although she eventually changed her telephone number, Father was aware of her prior address, which remained unchanged from August 2006 to 2010, and Father knew how to contact her parents, but failed to do so. Grandfather, for his part, expressed concern about providing for Children\u2019s education and financial future, stating that his present job as a college instructor would allow Children to attend college free of tuition if he were permitted to adopt them. Grandfather also explained that he had contemplated adopting Children for years, but claimed that he \u201cdidn\u2019t see a need\u201d to proceed with the adoption earlier, as there had been no foreseeable threat that Father would seek custody. N.T., 8/13/13, at 27. In his defense, Father testified that he did not send Children cards or gifts because he was not sure if Mother\u2019s address had changed. Father also explained that he sought custody in order to become more involved in Children\u2019s lives and to form a relationship with them.\nBy way of background, Section 2511(a) of the Adoption Act provides statutory grounds for terminating a parent\u2019s rights to his or her child where any one of the nine enumerated grounds for termination is established by clear and convincing evidence, including, as relevant herein, \u201c[t]he parent by conduct continuing for a period of at least six months immediately preceding the filing of the petition either has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to a child or has refused or failed to perform parental duties.\u201d 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2511(a)(1). If the trial court finds the existence of one of the grounds for termination set forth in Section 2511(a), the court must then consider whether termination would best serve \u201cthe developmental, physical and emotional needs and welfare of the child\u201d under Section 2511(b). Id. \u00a7 2511(b). The trial court may grant a termination petition if it is satisfied that termination of the parent\u2019s rights is consistent with the best interests of the child.\nSection 2512(a) of the Adoption Act sets forth the parties who may file a petition for involuntary termination, including, inter alia, a parent or an agency. Id. \u00a7 2512(a), In contrast to an agency petition, a parent petitioning to terminate the rights of the child\u2019s other parent must file a termination petition containing \u201can averment that the petitioner will assume custody of the child until such time as the child is adopted.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2512(b) (emphasis added). Thus, the petitioning parent must demonstrate that an adoption of the child is anticipated in order for the termination petition to be cognizable. See In re B.E., 474 Pa. 139, 377 A.2d 153, 155 (1977); In re Adoption of L.J.B., 610 Pa. 213, 18 A.3d 1098, 1107 (2011) (plurality). Section 2512(b)\u2019s adoption requirement is consistent with the rationale behind permitting the involuntary termination of a parent\u2019s rights, which we have explained is \u201cto dispense with the need for parental consent to an adoption when, by choice or neglect, a parent has failed to meet the continuing needs of the child,\u201d rather than \u201cto punish an ineffective or negligent parent, or provide a means for changing the surname of the child.\u201d B.E., 377 A.2d at 155; L.J.B., 18 A.3d at 1108 (quoting B.E.).\nBecause a termination petition filed by one parent against the other must occur in the context of an anticipated adoption, and because adoption is a statutory right, we note that the parent seeking termination must strictly comply with all pertinent provisions of the Adoption Act in order for the adoption to be valid. See In re Adoption of R.B.F., 569 Pa. 269, 803 A.2d 1195, 1199 (2002) (\u201cTo effect an adoption, the legisla tive provisions of the Adoption Act must be strictly complied with.\u201d). While the Adoption Act provides that \u201c[a]ny individual may become an adopting parent,\u201d 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2312, relevant to the instant matter, Section 2711 of the Act requires the parent seeking termination to consent to the adoption and to relinquish his or her parental rights. Id. \u00a7 2711(a)(3) (requiring consent to adoption by the parent of an adoptee who is under 18 years of age); \u00a7 2711(d)(1) (setting forth contents of consent, including the statement \u201cI understand that by signing this consent I indicate my intent to permanently give up all rights to this child\u201d). Requiring parental consent to the adoption and the relinquishment of his or her parental rights \u201cpermits the child and the adoptive parent or parents to establish a new parent-child relationship.\u201d B.E., 377 A.2d at 156. Thus, where \u201cno new parent-child relationship is contemplated[,] ... the involuntary termination of ... parental rights ... is not permitted under the Adoption Act.\u201d Id.; L.J.B., 18 A.3d at 1108 (quoting B.E.).\nAn exception to this relinquishment requirement exists, however, in second-parent adoption cases where the adopting party is the spouse of the parent seeking termination \u2014 that is, in the context of a stepparent adoption. Indeed, where the parent consents to an adoption of his child by his or her spouse \u2014 i.e., the stepparent \u2014 -the consenting parent is permitted to retain his or her parental rights. See 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2903. (\u201cWhenever a parent consents to the adoption of his child by his spouse, the parent-child relationship between him and his child shall remain whether or not he is one of the petitioners in the adoption proceeding.\u201d).\nAdditionally, if the parent does not consent to relinquish his or her parental rights, the court nevertheless may enter an adoption decree upon \u201ccause shown.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2901. In R.B.F., wherein parents sought to have their domestic partners adopt their children, but did not wish to relinquish their parental rights, we interpreted Section 2901\u215b \u201ccause shown\u201d language as giving the trial court the discretion to grant an adoption petition in circumstances where, as in that case, the party seeking adoption is unable to meet the statutory requirements for adoption, but has demonstrated cause for his or her noncompliance with those requirements. R.B.F., 803 A.2d at 1201-02.\nTurning back to the instant case, following the termination hearing, the orphans\u2019 court found that Mother and Grandfather demonstrated cause pursuant to Section 2901 as to why the proposed adoption by Grandfather should be allowed to proceed despite the fact that Mother did not relinquish her parental rights, reasoning that Grandfather had already been acting as a parent to Children and that allowing him to adopt Children would \u201cmemorialize that status quo of [their] lives.\u201d Orphans\u2019 Court Opinion, 8/19/13, at 5. Thus, having found that Mother and Grandfather demonstrated that a valid adoption by Grandfather was anticipated, the court then evaluated the termination petition and concluded that Mother and Grandfather proved by clear and convincing evidence that Father failed to perform his parental duties for almost all of the preceding six years of Children\u2019s lives, thereby evidencing a \u201csettled purpose of relinquishing parental claim\u201d to Children warranting termination under Section 2511(a)(1). Finally, finding that no bond existed between Children and Father, the court held that involuntarily terminating Father\u2019s parental rights and permitting the adoption would best serve Children\u2019s developmental, physical, and emotional needs and welfare. Accordingly, the orphans\u2019 court granted the termination petition.\nFather appealed the decision, challenging the termination of his parental rights, as well as the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s conclusion that Mother and Grandfather showed cause under Section 2901 of the Adoption Act to proceed with the anticipated adoption of Children by Grandfather. More specifically, Father alleged that the proposed adoption by Grandfather would not create a new family unit and that it was not in Children\u2019s best interests, claiming that Grandfather petitioned to adopt Children solely to retaliate against Father\u2019s custody action.\nIn its Pa.R.A.P.1925(a) opinion, the orphans\u2019 court reiterated its conclusion that Mother proved by clear and convincing evidence the prerequisites of Section 2511(a)(1), and that termination of Father\u2019s parental rights was in Children\u2019s best interests pursuant to Section 2511(b). The orphans\u2019 court also reasoned that Mother showed cause as to why the proposed adoption by Grandfather should proceed and that the adoption was in Children\u2019s best interests, specifically noting that it credited Grandfather\u2019s testimony that he had contemplated adopting Children for years, but did not see a need to do so until Father sought custody.\nAn en banc Superior Court panel affirmed in a 5 to 3 decision authored by President Judge Gantman. In re Adoption of M.R.D., 128 A.3d 1249 (Pa.Super. filed Dec. 8, 2015) (en banc). In so doing, the majority first recounted the evidence of record \u2014 including, most notably, that Father had not contacted, visited, or supported Children for almost six years \u2014 and opined that the evidence proved that Father demonstrated \u201cboth a settled purpose of relinquishing his parental claim to Children and a failure to perform his parental duties,\u201d thereby establishing grounds for termination under Section 2511(a)(1). Id. at 1264 (emphasis original). The majority also concluded that termination of Father\u2019s parental rights and adoption of Children by Grandfather was in Children\u2019s best interests under Section 2511(b), as competent evidence established that Grandfather\u2019s involvement with Children exceeded the role of a typical grandparent and that Mother filed the termination petition to \u201csafeguard Children\u2019s best interests,\u201d rather than to retaliate against Father\u2019s decision to seek custody. Id. The majority emphasized that the orphans\u2019 court sat as fact-finder during the termination hearing and that its credibility findings in this regard were supported by the record.\nWhile Father asserted that the proposed adoption would not create a new family unit, the majority disagreed. Specifically, the majority observed that the terms \u201cnew family unit\u201d and \u201cnew parent-child relationship\u201d are not used in the Adoption Act or defined in relevant case law, and it stressed that the Superior Court in In re Adoption of J.M., 991 A.2d 321 (Pa.Super.2010), which similarly involved a mother and maternal grandfather who sought to terminate the father\u2019s parental rights to facilitate the adoption of the child by the grandfather, expressly rejected the notion that adoptive parents must cohabitate in order to create a new family unit for purposes of termination of parental rights and adoption. The majority further cautioned against defining a family unit with such a \u201crigid mindset,\u201d particularly in light of evolving societal norms, which the majority noted embrace a variety of familial structures beyond the traditional nuclear family. M.R.D., 128 A.3d at 1265. Thus, rather than focusing solely on cohabitation when determining whether the proposed adoption would create a new family unit in this case, the majority looked to the parental relationship that Grandfather had with Children and determined that adoption would legalize Grandfather\u2019s rights and obligations with respect to Children, thereby \u201cestablishing] the \u2018new\u2019 in the existing de facto parent-child relationship.\u201d Id. at 1266. Accordingly, based on the foregoing, the majority concluded that there was \u201ccause shown\u201d under Section 2901 to permit Grandfather to adopt Children while Mother retained her parental rights.\nJudge Stabile authored a dissenting opinion, joined by Judge Shogan and then-Judge, now-Justice, Donohue, in which he disagreed with the principle that a mother could use her father as an \u201cadoptive resource\u201d in order to involuntarily terminate a father\u2019s parental rights. M.R.D., 128 A.3d at 1266 (Stabile, J., dissenting). Specifically, Judge Stabile explained that, because Mother sought to terminate Father\u2019s parental rights, Section 2512 of the Adoption Act requires the termination petition to identify \u201ca qualified person -willing and able to adopt the Children.\u201d Id. at 1266-67. Judge Stabile further emphasized that Section 2903 permits the petitioning parent to retain his or her parental rights only in situations where a stepparent is the adopting party, and it \u201cdoes not apply to individuals whose relationship with the petitioning parent is not a legally recognized marriage.\u201d Id. at 1267. Thus, given that Grandfather is not Mother\u2019s spouse, Judge Stabile concluded that Grandfather is not a qualified adoptive resource, rendering Mother\u2019s termination petition facially invalid.\nWhile the majority concluded that Mother and Grandfather established cause under Section 2901 to permit the adoption despite the fact that Grandfather is not Mother\u2019s spouse, Judge Stabile noted that the majority based its decision on J.M., which he found to be factually distinguishable and inapplicable to the situation at hand. Judge Stabile observed that, in that case, the Superior Court merely considered the threshold question of whether a petitioning parent was permitted to. show cause to waive the Adoption Act\u2019s relinquishment requirement where the grandfather sought to adopt his grandchild and co-parent with his daughter, but that it did not consider, let alone hold, that the mother had demonstrated cause to proceed with the adoption under the circumstances of that case. Thus, Judge Stabile reasoned that the majority\u2019s reliance on J.M. to support its conclusion that cause existed for Grandfather\u2019s adoption of Children was misplaced. Further, Judge Stabile opined that, to the extent that J.M. could be construed as supporting such a conclusion, the case was wrongly decided, as, in reaching its holding, it relied upon R.B.F., which allowed petitioners to demonstrate cause to permit an adoption by the parent\u2019s same-sex partner while permitting the parent to retain his parental rights \u2014 a different situation than that involved in J.M.\nAdditionally, Judge Stabile disagreed that the proposed adoption would create a new parent-child relationship and a new family unit warranting the termination of Father\u2019s parental rights, as Grandfather remained married to Grandmother, lived in a separate residence with her, did not plan to cohabi-tate with Mother, and, unlike in cases involving stepparent or same-sex partner adoptions, is related to Children and already part of their family. Judge Stabile cautioned that such an arrangement would potentially \u201ccreate unintended and undesirable consequences that do not promote a new family unit,\u201d including legal and social confusion over family members\u2019 new hybrid roles \u2014 i.e., Grandmother becoming a stepparent and Mother becoming a stepsister \u2014 and additional complications if Mother ever sought to marry. Id. at 1271.\nFollowing the Superior Court\u2019s decision, Father filed a petition for allowance of appeal with this Court. We granted allocatur to consider whether Mother established cause under Section 2901 of the Adoption Act to proceed with the proposed adoption by Grandfather. See In re: Adoption of M.R.D. and T.M.D., 635 Pa. 197, 133 A.3d 293 (2016) (order).\nBefore us, Father argues that the lower courts erred in finding that Mother established cause under Section 2901 to proceed with the anticipated adoption of Children by Grandfather despite the fact that Mother did not relinquish her parental rights. Specifically, Father emphasizes that the purpose of permitting the involuntary termination of a parent\u2019s rights in the context of an adoption is to \u201cprotect the integrity and stability of the new family unit,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 10, which he maintains would not be achieved by the proposed adoption in the instant case because Grandfather would not be living with Mother and Children, and, thus, no new parent-child relationship or family unit would be created.\nWhile Father concedes that the Superior Court opined in J.M. that cohabitation is not the sine qua non of a new family unit, he notes, consistent with the dissent below, that the Superior Court in that case held only that mother and grandfather were permitted to show cause under Section 2901, but that it remanded to the orphans\u2019 court to make the ultimate determination as to whether cause was shown. Father suggests that, rather than relying upon J.M., the Superior Court should have instead considered L.J.B. (remanding for hearing regarding stepmother\u2019s intention to adopt where stepmother and the child\u2019s father were separated) and Adoption of J.D.S., 763 A.2d 867 (Pa.Super.2000) (holding that proposed adoption by stepparent who was separated from the child\u2019s mother was not valid, and that, as a result, termination of the father\u2019s parental rights was inappropriate), when interpreting the term \u201cfamily unit,\u201d as, according to Father, both of those cases demonstrate that cohabitation is essential to forming a family unit and, thus, an adoption is not permitted where the parties will not be living together as an intact family. Father claims that it would be absurd to disallow a stepparent who no longer lives with the child\u2019s parent from adopting, as the Superior Court held in J.D.S., but to permit a non-spouse grandparent who has not resided with Children in 10 years to adopt.\nAs further support for his position, Father points to cases involving the standing of a grandparent to file for custody of their grandchildren, noting that, in D.G. v. D.B., 91 A.3d 706 (Pa.Super.2014), the Superior Court held that a grandmother who exercised custody of her grandchild every other weekend and one night per week, but who had not lived with her grandchild in over four years, was not in loco parentis to the child and, thus, lacked standing to seek custody. Compare Argenio v. Fenton, 703 A.2d 1042 (Pa.Super.1997) (holding that a grandmother who frequently babysat her granddaughter was not in loco parentis and, thus, lacked standing to seek custody of her granddaughter); with T.B. v. L.R.M., 567 Pa. 222, 786 A.2d 913 (2001) (holding that domestic partner who assumed a parental status over her partner\u2019s child and performed parental duties with the partner\u2019s permission stood in loco parentis to the child and had standing to seek partial custody and visitation). Relying on those cases, Father asserts that cohabitation is an important factor in obtaining standing in child custody actions, and he suggests that it would be illogical to require cohabitation for a grandparent to obtain in loco parentis standing in a child custody action, but not to require cohabitation in cases where a grandparent seeks to adopt his grandchild while terminating the parental rights of a biological parent.\nFather stresses that, contrary to the majority\u2019s opinion below, his position on requiring parental cohabitation for an adoption does not ignore evolving social norms with respect to the construct of a family unit, particularly considering the fact that he does not argue that a marriage is required for an adoption. However, Father maintains that legal parameters regarding what constitutes an intact family unit are necessary in the context of involuntary terminations and adoptions because, otherwise, Section 2901\u215b cause provision would be rendered meaningless, and the \u201cfloodgates\u201d would open, allowing for \u201cany ready third party\u201d to \u201csimply volunteer to be the new parent\u201d in order to oust the unwanted parent from a child's life. Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 16. Father opines that such a situation is precisely what occurred in the instant case, claiming that Mother\u2019s characterization of Grandfather\u2019s role as \u201cparental\u201d was exaggerated in order to facilitate the termination of Father\u2019s parental rights and that, in reality, Grandfather acted as a \u201ctypical grandparent,\u201d providing extra assistance with Children because caring for twins was more difficult than caring for one child. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 20.\nFather also disagrees with the lower courts\u2019 determination that adoption of Children by Grandfather would be in Children\u2019s best interests. Specifically, Father highlights that Grandfather would not have pursued adoption had it not been for Father\u2019s decision to file for custody of Children, and he argues that permitting the adoption will prevent Children from inheriting from Father or any of his family. Additionally, Father contends that the proposed adoption will create mixed family roles, such as the fact that Children\u2019s legal father would also be their Mother\u2019s father, and will create the appearance of an incestuous relationship between Mother and Grandfather, as the relationship between parents is typically intimate. Father submits that these unique family dynamics could cause stigma and confusion and have long-term adverse impacts on Children. Thus, based on the foregoing, Father asserts that the Superior Court\u2019s decision should be reversed and that the order terminating his parental rights should be vacated.\nIn response, Mother and Grandfather emphasize that Section 2312 of the Adoption Code provides that \u201c[a]ny individual may become an adopting parent,\u201d and that the Adoption Code contains no cohabitation requirement. Appellees\u2019 Brief at 8. Thus, Mother and Grandfather dismiss Father\u2019s argument as merely an attempt to \u201c\u2018engraft\u2019 a cohabitation requirement where none exists.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Brief at 15. Contrary to Father\u2019s position, Mother and Grandfather maintain that they have an existing \u201cintact family unit\u201d with Children regardless of the fact that Grandfather does not reside with Mother and Children, and they argue that terminating Father\u2019s parental rights and permitting Grandfather to adopt Children would promote the stability of their family unit, consistent with the underlying purpose of allowing for the termination of a biological parent\u2019s rights and an adoption. Appellees\u2019 Brief at 18. Mother and Grandfather suggest that it is \u201cfar better\u201d to permit an adoption by a loving family member \u201cthan to permit a stranger from South Dakota, who purposely absented himself from his children\u2019s lives for eight years, to turn this family upside down.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Brief at 20. Moreover, although Father raised concerns that permitting another family member to adopt a child while a biological parent retains her parental rights would allow families to use adoption as a tool to essentially force out the other parent, Mother and Grandfather posit that orphans\u2019 courts are well equipped to assess the unique facts of each case and determine whether a proposed adoption is a sham.\nMother and Grandfather further argue that imposing \u201cparameters\u201d on what constitutes an intact family unit ignores the realities of modern day America, as many Americans today are plagued by financial difficulties and forced to adapt by living with various relatives who are financially positioned to help them. Thus, Mother and Grandfather submit that what constitutes a family unit in today\u2019s times largely depends on the creativity and financial resources of a variety of individuals. Here, consistent with that notion, Mother and Grandfather allege that Father\u2019s inaction forced Grandfather to \u201cstep up to the plate\u201d and perform Father\u2019s parental duties, thus creating a family unit and establishing \u201c[f]ar more than good cause\u201d to permit the adoption under Section 2901. Appellees\u2019 Brief at 20, 23.\nTurning to the issue of whether the proposed adoption by Grandfather is in Children\u2019s best interests, Mother and Grandfather offer that the orphans\u2019 court specifically found that the adoption was legitimate and in Children\u2019s best interests, and that the court\u2019s findings in this regard were supported by competent evidence. Thus, Mother and Grandfather argue that, by likening Grandfather\u2019s relationship with Children to that of a typical grandfather, Father essentially is asking this Court to act as a \u201csuper fact finder\u201d and reevaluate the evidence, contrary to the established standard of review for termination and adoption cases. Appellees\u2019 Brief at 25. In any event, Mother and Grandfather contend that the termination of Father\u2019s parental rights and the proposed adoption by Grandfather is indeed in Children\u2019s best interests, as \u201c[n]o reasonable parent would think that it was in the best interests of their children to permit an individual with nothing in common with her children other than DNA to re-enter their family after having abandoning it for eight years.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Brief at 26. Additionally, to the extent that Father claims that the proposed adoption would cause Children to suffer from stigma and create difficulties for Mother if she decides to marry in the future, Mother and Grandfather dismiss Father\u2019s arguments as mere conjecture.\nLastly, with respect to Father\u2019s comparison of this case to child custody cases involving in loco parentis standing, Mother and Grandfather maintain that Father failed to raise this claim below, rendering it waived. Regardless, Mother and Grandfather posit that the custody statute is distinguishable from the Adoption Code because the custody statute specifically limits the individuals who have standing to pursue a custody action, whereas the Adoption Code expressly permits \u201cany individual\u201d to adopt. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2312.\nWith these arguments in mind, we now focus our analysis on the issues before us. Although this case concerns the involuntary termination of parental rights, our grant of review does not involve an assessment of the sufficiency of the evidence for termination, but, rather, is a pure question of law \u2014 the preliminary question of whether a legal parent may establish cause under Section 2901 to excuse the relinquishment requirement and proceed with a proposed adoption by a grandparent. See In re Adoption of S.E.G., 587 Pa. 568, 901 A.2d 1017, 1018 (2006). Accordingly, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Id. at 1018 n. 1.\nIn this case, there is little question that Mother and Grandfather have established by clear and convincing evidence that Father evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing his parental claim to Children and that he failed to perform his parental duties, as neither party disputes that Father has had no contact with Children in eight years, well beyond the six-month period required under Section 2511(a). However, as we explained, supra, because it is Mother who is seeking to terminate Father\u2019s parental rights, rather than an agency, under existing Pennsylvania law, Mother must demonstrate that an adoption of Children is contemplated in order for the termination petition to be cognizable. See 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2512(b). While Mother attempts to meet this statutory requirement by offering Grandfather as the prospective adoptive father, the Adoption Act, as a general rule, requires that she relinquish her parental rights in order for the prospective adoption by Grandfather to be valid. See id. \u00a7 2711(d)(1).\nIf Mother had desired to relinquish her rights to Children, and assuming arguendo that an adoption by Grandfather and the termination of Father\u2019s parental rights were in Children\u2019s best interests, Grandfather would be permitted to adopt Children, and termination of Father\u2019s parental rights would have been proper, ending our inquiry. However, Mother wishes for Grandfather to adopt Children while she retains her parental rights, a scenario which is contrary to Section 2711(d)(1) and is not otherwise permitted in the Adoption Act. Indeed, while the Adoption Act allows a parent to retain his or her rights in cases where a stepparent petitions to adopt his or her child, id. \u00a7 2903, the Act contains no other provision authorizing a biological parent who consents to an adoption to retain his or her parental rights. Thus, recognizing this impediment to the proposed adoption and, ultimately, to their termination petition, Mother and Grandfather seek to waive the general rule of relinquishment pursuant to Section 2901.\nAs noted above, we held in R.B.F. that, in cases in which a party seeking adoption is unable to meet the statutory requirements under the Adoption Act, Section 2901 allows the party to show \u201ccause\u201d as to why he or she cannot meet those requirements, and, upon such a showing, the trial court has the discretion to waive the requirement and grant the adoption petition. R.B.F., 803 A.2d at 1201-02. In those consolidated cases, same-sex couples sought a second-parent adoption of the legal parent\u2019s child without the legal parent having to relinquish his or her parental rights. Finding that it was, indeed, possible for parties to waive the relinquishment requirement under Section 2901 upon a showing of cause, we remanded to the respective trial courts to determine whether the couples showed cause to waive the requirement under the particular circumstances of their cases. Id. at 1203.\nSimilar to the appellants in R.B.F., Mother and Grandfather also seek to waive the Adoption Act\u2019s relinquishment requirement, albeit under a different factual scenario. Indeed, unlike in R.B.F., which did not involve involuntary termination due to the absence of a second legal parent, there obviously is no intimate relationship between the legal parent (Mother) and the prospective adoptive parent (Grandfather), Rather, Mother and Grandfather, who share a parent-child relationship of their own, seek to waive the relinquishment requirement in order to allow Grandfather to adopt Children and co-parent them with Mother, thereby facilitating the termination of Father\u2019s parental rights. Thus, we consider for the first time whether a parent and a grandparent \u2014 and, more specifically, Mother and Grandfather \u2014 may establish cause under Section 2901 to waive the requirement that the parent relinquish her parental rights when the grandparent seeks to adopt that parent\u2019s children \u2014 his grandchildren.\nWe explained in R.B.F. that a party could show cause by clear and convincing evidence if he or she demonstrated that \u201cthe purpose of Section 2711(d)\u2019s relinquishment of parental rights requirement will be otherwise fulfilled or is unnecessary under the particular circumstances of [his or her] case.\u201d Id. The purpose behind the termination or relinquishment of an existing parent\u2019s rights prior to an adoption is to facilitate a \u201cnew parent-child relationship\u201d between the child and the adoptive parent, B.E., 377 A.2d at 156 (\u201cTermination of parental rights permits the child and the adoptive parent or parents to establish a new parent-child relationship through adoption\u201d), and to protect \u201cthe integrity and stability of the new family unit.\u201d J.D.S., 763 A.2d at 871; L.J.B., 18 A.3d at 1108. Accordingly, Mother and Grandfather may show cause to waive the relinquishment requirement only if they can establish that permitting Grandfather to adopt Children while Mother retains her parental rights will promote a new family unit or that it is otherwise unnecessary to require Mother to relinquish her parental rights under the circumstances of this case.\nHere, Mother and Grandfather claim that the relinquishment requirement should be waived and that Grandfather should be permitted to adopt Children so as to protect their \u201cintact family unit\u201d and provide stability in Children\u2019s lives. Appellees\u2019 Brief at 18. We must disagree.\nIn the standard adoption case, termination and relinquishment of parental rights is necessary so that the child may be adopted by, and form new bonds with, his or her new family, unencumbered by the former legal parents. By contrast, in second-parent adoption cases in which the relinquishment of a parent\u2019s rights is not required \u2014 i.e., stepparent adoptions and adoptions by same-sex couples \u2014 relinquishment of the parent\u2019s rights is unnecessary, and indeed damaging. In such cases, the parent and the prospective adoptive parent are committed partners \u2014 that is, they are involved in a horizontal relationship, are equals as between each other, and are equals with respect to the child. Adoption in such circumstances allows the prospective adoptive parent to create a new parent-child relationship with the legal parent\u2019s child and a family unit together with the co-parent to whom he or she is committed. Thus, because the legal parent and prospective parent in second-parent adoption cases are part of the same family unit, the relinquishment requirement undermines, rather than promotes, family stability.\nThe same cannot be said for the instant case, however, because Mother and Grandfather are not similarly part of an intact family unit. Indeed, rather than being involved in a committed, horizontal relationship such as stepparents or same-sex partners, Mother and Grandfather share a vertical, parent-child relationship. Moreover, in this case, Grandfather will remain married to Grandmother and will continue to live in a separate residence with her after the adoption. Adoption does not foster a family unit under circumstances where, as here, the adopting party is already part of \u2014 and will continue to be part of \u2014 a family unit that is separate from the unit which he seeks to promote and join through adoption.\nAdditionally, relinquishment is necessary in this ease to avoid a host of unique complications. For example, such an arrangement would create confusing hybrid relationships within the family \u2014 Grandfather would be both Children\u2019s father and grandfather, Grandmother would be both a grandmother and a stepmother, and, more confusing still, because of Grandmother\u2019s status as a stepmother, Mother would be both a mother to Children and, technically, their stepsister. Further complicating matters, if Mother ever seeks to marry, the Act does not require Grandfather to terminate his parental rights in favor of Mother\u2019s spouse; thus, he could decide to remain Children\u2019s father and prevent Mother\u2019s spouse from having legal rights over Children. Grandfather has neither considered, nor explained, how his role with Children might change if Mother married. N.T., 8/13/13, at 23-26.\nLastly, although the orphans\u2019 court rejected the possibility in the instant case, permitting Grandfather to adopt and co-parent Children with mother would nevertheless open the door for misuse of adoption proceedings by spiteful parents as a means to involuntarily terminate the rights of unwanted parents, potentially allowing grandparents, cousins, pastors, coaches, and a litany of other individuals who have a close relationship with a child to stand in as prospective adoptive parents so that termination may be achieved. Given that the \u201ccomplete and irrevocable termination of parental rights is one of the most serious and severe steps a court can take,\u201d In re Bowman, 542 Pa. 268, 666 A.2d 274, 280 (1995), we must ensure that we do not open the floodgates to such gamesmanship.\nWe are mindful that, in today\u2019s times, societal norms pertaining to what constitutes a family are constantly evolving. Moreover, we commend Grandfather for stepping up to provide for Children over the past 10 years and for his willingness to do so in the future. Indeed, there are undoubtedly other individuals in similar situations who wish to assist single parents with the difficult task of raising their children. Nevertheless, parties seeking adoption must strictly comply with the existing provisions of the Adoption Act. Here, Mother and Grandfather have not met their burden of showing that the proposed adoption by Grandfather would serve the underlying purposes of relinquishment, or that relinquishment is otherwise unnecessary under the circumstances of this case. See R.B.F. In other words, they have not demonstrated that the proposed co-parenting arrangement would create a new family unit or a new parent-child relationship, particularly, and significantly, given Grandfather\u2019s existing parent-child relationship with Mother, his existing marriage to Grandmother, and his intention to continue living in a separate residence with Grandmother following the adoption. Thus, while Grandfather\u2019s efforts in assisting Mother with Children are certainly laudable, and while Grandfather is in no way precluded from enjoying partial custody of Children, Grandfather\u2019s pre-exist-ing and continuing close relationship with Children does not establish legal cause to excuse the requirement that Mother relinquish her parental rights under Section 2711 prior to the adoption. As such, the adoption proposed herein may not proceed. As the proposed adoption is not otherwise valid, we need not consider whether the adoption would have been in Children\u2019s best interests.\nIn sum, Mother and Grandfather have not demonstrated that, under Pennsylvania law, a valid adoption of Children is anticipated; thus, their termination petition is not cognizable, and so they are precluded from seeking the involuntary termination of Father\u2019s parental rights. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand to the orphans\u2019 court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nJustice DONOHUE did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\nChief Justice SAYLOR and Justices DOUGHERTY and WECHT join the opinion.\nJustice BAER flies a concurring opinion.\nJustice TODD files a special concurring opinion.\nJustice WECHT files a concurring opinion.\n. As noted, this requirement is excused if the petitioner is an agency. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2512(b) (\"If the petitioner is an agency it shall not be required to aver that an adoption is presently contemplated nor that a person with a present intention to adopt exists.\u201d).\n. While Justice Baer contends in his Concurring Opinion that we have placed \"undue emphasis\u201d on R.B.F., we note that both parties to this appeal have specifically agreed that R.B.F. governs this case. Furthermore, although Justice Baer suggests that this Court\u2019s holding in R.B.F. was limited to adoption petitions filed by same-sex partners \"at a time when they could not marry,\u201d Concurring Opinion (Baer, J.) at 533, 145 A.3d at 1131, our decision in that case contains no such limitations. First, that the same-sex partners in that case could not then marry was not relevant to our decision other than in noting that the spousal exception obviously did not apply to them. See R.B.F., 803 A.2d at 1202 (\u201cThere is no language in the Adoption Act precluding two unmarried same-sex partners (or unmarried heterosexual partners) from adopting a child who had no legal parents.\u201d). Moreover, in R.B.F., we stated in broad terms that \u201cthere is no reasonable construction of the Section 2901 'cause shown\u2019 language other than to conclude that it permits a petitioner to demonstrate why, in a particular case, he or she cannot meet the statutory requirements.\u201d Id, at 1201-02. Thus, until the instant case, we have not limited the type of petitioners who may show cause to excuse the relinquishment requirement under Section 2901.\n. Moreover, although there is absolutely no issue of incest in this case, as the New Jersey Superior Court noted under similar circumstances, allowing a grandparent to adopt his or her child\u2019s children and co-parent them with his or her child raises the possible societal perception of an incestuous relationship between the grandparent and his child, a relationship which is both a criminal offense and which carries a social stigma. See In re Adoption of Child by Nathan S., 396 N J.Super. 378, 934 A.2d 64, 68 (Ch. Div. 2006) (warning that \"it might appear that the Court created an incestuous relationship if it allowed a grandparent to co-parent his biological grandchild with his daughter\u201d); see also 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4302 (criminalizing incest); 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1304(e) (prohibiting marriage between relatives, including between a parent and child).\n. We note that our decision does not preclude a grandparent from seeking to adopt a grandchild in cases where the child\u2019s parent relinquishes his or her parental rights."}
