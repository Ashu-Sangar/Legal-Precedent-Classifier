{"id": "922942", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn the case at bar the court below directed the jury to return a verdict for the defendant. The direction was founded upon the conclusion that the alleged negligence of the defendant was not the proximate cause of the injury the plaintiff received. The conclusion was supported by the testimony in the case and necessarily relieved the defendant from any liability arising from the plaintiff\u2019s negligence. We therefore dismiss the specification of error.\nJudgment affirmed."}
