{"id": "500868", "contents": "Mr. Justice Gordon\ndelivered the opinion of the court, November 20th 1882.\nSo far as we can gather from the scanty records before us, the judgment in controversy, the one on which the sheriff\u2019s sale was made, and under which the plaintiffs claim, was entered against \u201c Fr. Zehnter.\u201d It would seem also, that the note on which the judgment was founded was signed \u201cFr. Zehnder.\u201d As there was no material difference in the name as found in the note and judgment, and as it appears on the index, it is clear that the plaintiff was in no default in not seeing that his judgment was properly docketed. The use of the letter \u201ct\u201d for \u201cd\u201d in the surname, was but the substitution of that which would, in English, have the same sound as the German \u201cd,\u201d and this, as Was held in Meyer v. Fegaly, 3 Wr. 429, was not a fatal error. Neither was the omission of the small \u201cr\u201d from \u201cFr.\u201d of any serious moment, since both are contractions for the name \u201cFrederick,\u201d and if such contraction is allowable at all, the one, for the purposes of notice, was just as good as the other. But it has been held that the signing of \u201c A \u201d for the Christian name \u201c Abel,\u201d is good, or if the name used is that by which the debtor is commonly known, it is all that is required by the Act prescribing judgment dockets: Jones\u2019s Est., 3 Ca. 336. It does not follow that a man must adopt the name given to him in his infancy by his parents. He may reject part, or, for that matter, the whole of it, and assume some other. The real question is, by what name is he generally known? In the case in hand, as we have said, the plaintiff was in no default; he could do nothing else than what he did; as the note was signed so it was carried on to the judgment docket, and nothing more than this could be done.\nIn these particulars the circumstances are essentially different from those in the cases of Wood v. Reynolds, 7 W. & S. 406, and Hutchinson\u2019s Ap., 11 Nor. 186. In the first of these an initial letter, in the name of the defendant, by which he was principally distinguished from two other persons of the same name, was omitted in the transcription from the continuance docket to the judgment index, and in the second, in a like transcription, the middle letter of the name was changed from \u201cA\u201d to \u201cG,\u201d thus altogether destroying the defendant\u2019s identity. But if, in the case before us, there was any default at all, it was the default of the defendant in having failed to sign the note with that name by which he was commonly known. Whether this was so or not was a question for the jury. There is testimony showing that he was known among his neighbors by the name of \u201c Fred. Zehnder;\u201d he so states the fact himself, and the further proof is that he frequently signed papers as \u201cFrederick Zehnder.\u201d Under these circumstances the court below ought not to have taken the case from the jury.\nJudgment reversed and a new venire ordered."}
