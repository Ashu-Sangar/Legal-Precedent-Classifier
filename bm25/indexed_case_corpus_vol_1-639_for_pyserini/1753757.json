We granted allocatur.\nThe majority in the Superior Court concluded that the wife-defendant had demonstrated a valid defense to the plaintiff\u2019s claim and had acted with due dispatch in filing the petition to open the judgment, but found that she had not shown sufficient excuse for failing to file a timely answer to the complaint and, hence, the Court of Common Pleas had not been guilty of an abuse of discretion in refusing to open the judgment.\nWe find the reasoning and conclusions expressed by Judge Spaeth persuasive.\nThe orders of the Court of Common Pleas and the Superi- or Court are reversed, and the record is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\nO\u2019BRIEN, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. The loan agreement was allegedly signed by the husband and wife in 1964. The petition to open stated and depositions were filed to establish that the husband and wife had not lived together since 1957, and that the wife\u2019s signature on the loan agreement was a forgery."}
