{"id": "998743", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nThere was no final judgment in either of these cases. The demurrer of each defendant was sustained, but this without more was not a final judgment: Vide cases cited in 6 Ency. PI. & Pr. 353. There is no judgment in favor of the defendant from which the plaintiff has appealed. Until there is a final judgment, the question of his right to amend his statements cannot be considered here. Appeals quashed."}
