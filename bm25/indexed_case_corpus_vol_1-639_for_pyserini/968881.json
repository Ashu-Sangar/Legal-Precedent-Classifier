{"id": "968881", "contents": "Pee Ctieiam:\nThe register of wills refused to admit the will of Margaret Bearmer to probate, and granted letters of administration upon her estate to the appellants. From this decision an appeal was taken to the Orphans\u2019 Court. No issue was asked for at any stage of the proceedings. We have nothing before us but a question of fact upon which the Orphans\u2019 Court has reversed the register, and admitted the will to probate. The court finds that \u201cthe will in question was duly executed, and the witnesses thereto were competent and honest.\u201d We are not prepared to say this finding is not correct.\nDecree affirmed and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants."}
