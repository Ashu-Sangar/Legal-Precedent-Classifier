{"id": "6786905", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nThis appeal by the Commonwealth raises the issue of whether a defendant is statutorily eligible, within the meaning of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9802, to receive a county intermediate punishment sentence when a mandatory minimum sentence applies under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508. We conclude the Superior Court erred in holding such an offender is eligible, and accordingly, reverse.\nAfter state police seized over two and one-half pounds of marijuana from appellee\u2019s residence pursuant to a search warrant, appellee was charged with possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver (PWID) and possession of drug paraphernalia. Appellee entered an open guilty plea to PWID, and the Commonwealth nolle prossed the remaining charge. After entry of the plea, the Commonwealth entered notice of its intent to seek application of the mandatory minimum one-year sentence of incarceration pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508, which provides:\n(a) General rule. \u2014 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this or any other act to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply:\n(1) A person who is convicted of violating section 13(a) (14), (30) or (37) of the act of April 14, 1972 (P.L. 233, No. 64), known as The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act, where the controlled substance is marijuana shall, upon conviction, be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment and a f\u00edne as set forth in this subsection:\n(i) when the amount of marijuana involved is at least two pounds, but less than ten pounds ...; one year in prison and a fine of $5,000 or such larger amount as is sufficient to exhaust the assets utilized in and the proceeds from the illegal activity....\nId., \u00a7 7508(a)(1)(f) (emphasis added).\nFollowing a hearing, the trial court determined the Commonwealth proved by a preponderance of the evidence that appellee possessed over two pounds of marijuana with the intent to distribute it, invoking \u00a7 7508\u2019s mandatory minimum sentencing provisions. However, the trial court instead sentenced appellee to county intermediate punishment, imposing six months of work release from the county jail followed by six months of electronic home monitoring. See Trial Court Order, 10/12/11, at 1.\nFollowing the denial (by operation of law) of its motion to modify sentence, the Commonwealth appealed to the Superior Court. In its Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a) Opinion, the trial court stated that, at the time of sentencing, it believed appellee\u2019s sentence was supported by the sentencing guidelines, and the Commonwealth had not objected. The trial court explained it never realized the sentence was illegal because there was no hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion. The trial court concluded it had erred in imposing the sentence and requested the Superi- or Court vacate the sentence and remand for further proceedings. See Trial Court Opinion, 6/25/12, at 2-3.\nNevertheless, the Superior Court rejected the challenge to the sentence, holding \u201c[u]nder applicable precedent, if a person is statutorily eligible for county intermediate punishment, a county intermediate sentence may be imposed, even when a mandatory minimum sentence is applicable.\u201d Commonwealth v. Stotelmyer, No. 566 MDA 2012, unpublished memorandum at 13 (Pa.Super. filed March 19, 2013). The court began its analysis by noting 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721(a), which governs sentencing in general and provides seven sentencing options, includes county intermediate punishment. Subsection (a.l) of the statute provides subsection (a) does not apply where there is a mandatory minimum sentence, unless specifically authorized under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9763, which relates to sentences of county intermediate punishment. The court concluded that appellee\u2019s sentence was a permissible form of county intermediate punishment under \u00a7 9763, and therefore the exception in subsection (a.l) prescribing the imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence did not apply.\nIn support of its holding, the court relied on Commonwealth v. Williams, 941 A.2d 14 (Pa.Super.2008) (en banc), Commonwealth v. Mazzetti, 615 Pa. 555, 44 A.3d 58 (2012) (per curiam), and Commonwealth v. Hansley, 616 Pa. 367, 47 A.3d 1180 (2012). In Williams, the Superior Court held, notwithstanding the driving under the influence (DUI) statute\u2019s requirement of mandatory terms of imprisonment for DUI recidivists, a defendant convicted of a second DUI offense could be sentenced to county intermediate punishment, so long as the program was qualified and the defendant was a qualified \u201celigible offender\u201d under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9804, the intermediate punishment program statute. Williams, at 26 (citations omitted); see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9804(b)(1)\u00a9 (providing only \u201celigible offenders\u201d shall be sentenced to county intermediate punishment); id., \u00a7 9802 (defining \u201celigible offender\u201d as, inter alia, person convicted of offense who would otherwise be sentenced to county correctional facility).\nIn Mazzetti, this Court held the Commonwealth\u2019s waiver of the school zone mandatory minimum sentence, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(a), at the original sentencing precluded the Commonwealth from seeking its application following revocation of probation. Mazzetti, at 60. The Superior Court cited Mazzetti for the proposition that this Court \u201chas noted that \u00a7 9721(a.1) permits the imposition of intermediate punishment despite the fact that there is a pertinent mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration.\u201d Stotelmyer, at 8 (citing Mazzetti, at 66 (\u201c[S]ection 9721(a.1) acknowledges that 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9763 authorizes the trial court to impose a sentence of county intermediate punishment even if there is an applicable mandatory minimum.\u201d)).\nIn Hansley, this Court held the Recidivism Risk Reduction Incentive (RRRI) Act, 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4501 et seq., applied to a school zone mandatory minimum sentence imposed pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 6317 and 7508 of the Act. Hansley, at 1188. We concluded the Act\u2019s definition of \u201celigible offender\u201d included various eligibility requirements that excluded many crimes, but not drug offenses. Id.\nBased on its interpretation of the above cases, the Superior Court narrowed the inquiry to whether 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9763 authorizes imposition of county intermediate punishment for a defendant who is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508. The court looked to the County Intermediate Punishment Act\u2019s definition of \u201celigible offender\u201d:\nSubject to section 9721(a.l) (relating to sentencing generally), a person convicted of an offense who would otherwise be sentenced to a county correctional facility, who does not demonstrate a present or past pattern of violent behavior and who would otherwise be sentenced to partial confinement pursuant to section 9724 (relating to partial confinement) or total confinement pursuant to section 9725 (relating to total confinement). The term does not include ... an offender with a current conviction or a prior conviction within the past ten years for any of the following offenses:\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502 (relating to murder).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503 (relating to voluntary manslaughter).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702 (relating to aggravated assault).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2703 (relating to assault by prisoner).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2704 (relating to assault by life prisoner).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2901(a) (relating to kidnapping).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3122.1(a)(1) (relating to statutory sexual assault).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3301 (relating to arson and related offenses).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3502 (relating to burglary) when graded as a felony of the first degree.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701 (relating to robbery).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3923 (relating to theft by extortion).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4302(a) (relating to incest).\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5121 (relating to escape).\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9802 (emphasis added).\nNoting a drug offense is not one of the above-enumerated crimes that would exclude appellee from eligibility for county intermediate punishment, the Superior Court reasoned that under the sentencing guideline matrix, appellee would have received a sentence of county imprisonment because her prior record score was zero and her offense gravity score was five. Stotelmyer, at 12. Therefore, the court held appellee \u201c \u201cwould otherwise be sentenced to a county correctional facility,\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 9802. Id., at 11 (citation omitted). Accordingly, the court affirmed the judgment of sentence, concluding the Commonwealth failed to establish \u00a7 9763 did not authorize appellee\u2019s sentence of county intermediate punishment. Id., at 12-13.\nWe granted review to address the following issue:\nDid the Superior Court err in holding that a person is statutorily eligible for a county intermediate punishment sentence when a mandatory minimum sentence applies under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7508?\nCommonwealth v. Stotelmyer, 621 Pa. 190, 76 A.3d 536 (2013) (per curiam).\nThe interplay between the mandatory minimum sentence provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508, the exception regarding sentencing options in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721(a.l), and the definition of \u201celigible offender\u201d in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9802 requires a measure of statutory interpretation, and \u201c[b]ecause statutory interpretation is a question of law, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. In matters of statutory interpretation, the General Assembly\u2019s intent is paramount.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hacker, 609 Pa. 108,15 A.3d 333, 335 (2011) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted) (citing 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1921(a)). Generally, such \u201c\u2018intent is best expressed through the plain language of the statute.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Hart, 611 Pa. 531, 28 A.3d 898, 908 (2011) (citations omitted). Thus, \u201c[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). \u201cEvery statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d Id., \u00a7 1921(a). We presume the legislature did not intend a result that is absurd, impossible, or unreasonable, and that it \u201cintends the entire statute to be effective and certain.\u201d Id., \u00a7 1922(1)-(2). \u201cWhen evaluating the interplay of several statutory provisions, we recognize that statutes that relate to the same class of persons are in pari materia and \u2018should be construed together, if possible, as one statute.\u2019\u201d Hansley, at 1186 (quoting 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1932). If two statutes conflict, they are to be construed so effect may be given to both, if possible; if this is not possible, the special provision prevails over the general one as an exception to it, unless the general one was enacted later and there is manifest legislative intent that it prevail. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1933.\nThe Commonwealth points to 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508(c), which prohibits a sentencing court from deviating from the applicable mandatory minimum sentence and provides the sentencing guidelines shall not supersede \u00a7 7508\u2019s mandatory provisions. See id. The Commonwealth disagrees with the Superior Court\u2019s reasoning that this subsection is superseded because appellee was an \u201celigible offender\u201d under \u00a7 9802; the Commonwealth reasons the maximum sentence for delivery of a Schedule I controlled substance for an offender with an offense gravity score of five and a prior record score of zero is 60 months incarceration, which means appellee could have received a state sentence of total confinement and thus was not \u201ca person convicted of an offense who would otherwise be sentenced to a county correctional facility[.]\u201d Id., \u00a7 9802 (emphasis added). The Commonwealth further contends because it proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the one-year mandatory minimum sentence applied, appellee was not a person who would be otherwise sentenced to a county facility within the meaning of \u00a7 9802. Finally, the Commonwealth contends the cases the Superior Court relied upon are distinguishable.\nAppellee notes under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9802\u2019s plain language, an \u201celigible offender\u201d is a person who: (1) has not been convicted of any of the crimes enumerated in that section, and (2) cannot be subject to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721(a.l). As appellee was not convicted of any of the crimes listed in \u00a7 9802, she contends the ultimate issue is whether \u00a7 9721(a.l) applies to her. Section 9721(a.l) provides the sentencing options (one of which is county intermediate punishment) in subsection (a) do not apply when there is a mandatory minimum sentence \u201c[u]nless specifically authorized under section 9763[,]\u201d id., \u00a7 9721(a.l)(l); appellee argues \u00a7 9763 is not an authorizing statute and makes no provision for the imposition of mandatory sentences. Rather, appellee posits \u00a7 9763 is silent on the issue; therefore, we must ascertain legislative intent through judicial interpretation of \u00a7 9721(a.l). Appellee points to Williams \u2014 relied upon by the Superior Court \u2014 which permitted imposition of intermediate punishment for a DUI offense despite the fact DUI violations have mandatory minimum sentences. Finally, appellee contends a literal reading of \u00a7 9721(a.l) would lead to absurd results: if subsection (a) is inapplicable when there is a mandatory minimum sentence, then none of the sentencing options (e.g., partial/total confinement or a fine) can be imposed as the mandatory sentence, and there would be no punishment at all.\nAs the Superior Court noted, the options available to a sentencing court are enumerated in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9721(a):\n(a) General rule. \u2014 In determining the sentence to be imposed the court shall, except as provided in subsection (a.l), consider and select one or more of the following alternatives, and may impose them consecutively or concurrently:\n(1) An order of probation.\n(2) A determination of guilt without further penalty.\n(3) Partial confinement.\n(4) Total confinement.\n(5) A fine.\n(6) County intermediate punishment.\n(7) State intermediate punishment.\nId. (emphasis added). Subsection (a.l) contains the following exception:\n(1) Unless specifically authorized under section 9763 (relating to a sentence of county intermediate punishment) or 61 Pa.C.S. Ch. 41 (relating to State intermediate punishment), subsection (a) shall not apply where a mandatory minimum sentence is otherwise provided by law.\nId., \u00a7 9721(a.l)(l) (emphasis added). Thus, \u00a7 9721(a)\u2019s seven alternatives are available to a sentencing court unless a mandatory minimum sentence applies; however, even if such sentence applies, the court may still impose county intermediate punishment if it is \u201cspecifically authorized\u201d by \u00a7 9763.\nSection 9763\u2019s general provision requires the sentencing court to specify the length of the term of punishment and sets parameters for such term. See id., \u00a7 9763(a). It then lists permissible conditions the court may attach upon the defendant as it deems necessary, id., \u00a7 9763(b), requires persons being sentenced for certain Vehicle Code violations to undergo a drug and alcohol assessment and participate in treatment in conjunction with their county intermediate punishment, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9763(c), and includes a provision concerning sentencing following violation of the conditions in subsection (b), id., \u00a7 9763(d). Thus, while \u00a7 9763 apparently authorizes county intermediate punishment for offenses under the Vehicle Code even if there is a mandatory minimum sentence, it does not address appellee\u2019s situation: whether the mandatory minimum sentence must be imposed when the sentencing guidelines allow for intermediate punishment for PWID. Accordingly, we decline to find \u00a7 9763 authorizes deviation from \u00a7 7508\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence provision.\nSection 7508, in addition to containing the mandatory minimum sentencing provision at issue here, also provides:\n(c) Mandatory sentencing. \u2014 There shall he no authority in any court to impose on an offender to which this section is applicable a lesser sentence than provided for herein or to place the offender on probation, parole or work release or to suspend sentence. Nothing in this section shall prevent the sentencing court from imposing a sentence greater than provided herein. Sentencing guidelines promulgated by the Pennsylvania Commission on Sentencing shall not supersede the mandatory sentences provided herein. Disposition under section 17 or 18 of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act shall not be available to a defendant to which this section applies.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508(c) (emphasis added). The plain language of this subsection curtails a sentencing court\u2019s option to impose a lesser sentence once the mandatory minimum sentence is found applicable; furthermore, this subsection specifically provides the sentencing guidelines do not supersede a mandatory minimum sentence. Even without such provision, the guidelines (which are just that \u2014 guidelines) could never supersede or override a statute. Allowing the imposition of county intermediate punishment for persons subject to \u00a7 7508 would render subsection (c) of that statute meaningless.\nAdditionally, the Sentencing Code provides a sentencing court may not impose less than the mandatory minimum and states a guideline sentence which is less than the mandatory minimum cannot supersede the mandatory minimum:\n(h) Mandatory sentences. The court has no authority to impose a sentence less than that required by a mandatory minimum provision established in statute. When the guideline range is lower than that required by a mandatory sentencing statute, the mandatory minimum requirement supersedes the sentence recommendation. When the sentence recommendation is higher than that required by a mandatory sentencing statute, the court shall consider the guideline sentence recommendation.\n204 Pa.Code \u00a7 303.9(h) (emphasis added). The Sentencing Code also contains a specific provision titled \u201cMandatory sentences for which county intermediate punishment is authorized.\u201d Id., \u00a7 303.9(i). The only offenses mentioned in this subsection are operating a watercraft under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance, 30 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5502, and various Vehicle Code offenses, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1543(b), 3802, 3808(a)(2). Drug offenses under Title 35 are absent from this list, and the legislature certainly could have included them had it wished to do so.\nThus, the plain language of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508(c), read together with the above Sentencing Code provisions, makes clear the mandatory one-year prison sentence is what it says it is \u2014 mandatory. Accordingly, the Superior Court improperly relied on \u00a7 9802 to hold appellee was eligible for anything else; as the sentence was not \u201cauthorized\u201d by \u00a7 9763, appellee could not be an eligible offender under \u00a7 9802.\nThe eases the Superior Court relied on are distinguishable. Williams involved a DUI recidivist, and there are specific provisions in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9763 and 9804 permitting such offenders to be sentenced to county intermediate punishment after undergoing assessment \u2014 notwithstanding the mandatory sentencing provisions of \u00a7 3804 of the DUI statute \u2014 provided it is their first, second, or third DUI offense. See id., \u00a7\u00a7 9763(c), 9804(b)(4)\u00ae, (5). As previously noted, \u00a7 9763 is silent regarding Drug Act violations, as is \u00a7 9804, and neither section references a drug offender who is subject to a mandatory minimum prison sentence under \u00a7 7508. Had the legislature intended to have included this option, it would have done so, as it did with the DUI statute in Williams. Accordingly, Williams is not controlling in this instance.\nMazzetti, which the Superior Court relied on for the proposition that \u00a7 9721(a.1) permits the imposition of intermediate punishment even when there is a mandatory minimum sentence of incarceration, dealt with the discrete issue of \u201cwhether the Commonwealth\u2019s waiver of application of the school zone mandatory minimum sentence, under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317, at the original sentencing precludes the Commonwealth from subsequently seeking its application following the revocation of probation.\u201d Mazzetti, at 60 (footnote omitted). We held the Commonwealth could not seek the mandatory minimum sentence at resentencing following probation revocation because it waived application of such sentence at initial sentencing; a court, at resentencing, is only vested with the same alternatives it originally possessed. Id., at 65-66. Significantly, we noted \u00a7 6317\u2019s mandatory sentencing provisions divest the sentencing court of the authority to impose a lesser sentence or place the defendant on probation, id., at 65 (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(c)); the only reason the mandatory minimum did not have to be imposed was that the Commonwealth did not follow \u00a7 6317(b)\u2019s notice requirements, id. (citing 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6317(b) (requiring Commonwealth to provide reasonable notice of its intention to proceed under \u00a7 6317 after conviction and before sentencing)). Our comment, relied upon by the Superior Court, that \u201csection 9721(a.l) acknowledges that 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9763 authorizes the trial court to impose a sentence of county intermediate punishment even if there is an applicable mandatory minimum[,]\u201d id., at 66, can only be read as dicta in light of Mazzetti\u2019s specific issue.\nHansley involved the RRRI Act, under which a defendant initially sentenced to a minimum state sentence, if determined by the sentencing court to be eligible, is released on parole before the minimum sentence\u2019s expiration. The issue in Hansley was whether the RRRI Act applies to defendants sentenced to mandatory minimum terms required by the drug trafficking sentencing provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6317 and 7508. Although we held the RRRI Act applies to such defendants, we noted that when the General Assembly drafted the Act, it simultaneously amended certain Sentencing Code provisions, thereby evincing its awareness of the Act\u2019s effect on mandatory minimum sentences and its desire that the Act work in conformity with existing sentencing statutes. See Hansley, at 1190. No such intent is manifest in the Sentencing Code with respect to \u00a7 7508 itself; the only reason \u00a7 7508\u2019s mandatory minimum provision was held not to apply in Hansley was because the defendant received an RRRI Act sentence along with the mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 7508, which is not the case here. An RRRI Act minimum sentence is imposed \u201c \u2018in addition to a minimum sentence,\u2019 not instead of the minimum sentence.\u201d Id., at 1189 (citation omitted); see also 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4505(c)(l)-(2). Thus, an offender still receives a mandatory minimum sentence along with an RRRI Act minimum sentence, unlike the situation in the instant case. Accordingly, Hansley is not directly on point.\nTherefore, we hold the Superior Court erred in concluding \u00a7 9763 authorized imposition of a county intermediate sentence for appellee\u2019s PWID conviction. Section 7508 provides for a mandatory minimum sentence which, absent a specific statutory provision to the contrary, must be imposed. As county intermediate punishment was not authorized here, appellee was not eligible for any sentence other than the mandatory minimum. The order of the Superior Court is thus reversed and the matter remanded for resentencing.\nOrder reversed; case remanded. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nFormer Chief Justice CASTILLE and Former Justice McCAFFERY did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustices BAER and STEVENS join the opinion.\nChief Justice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion in which Justice TODD joins.\n. 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(30).\n. Id., \u00a7 780-113(a)(32).\n. The Commonwealth argued appellee\u2019s sentence was illegal for failing to comply with 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7508\u2019s mandatory minimum sentence. Despite being ordered to answer the motion, appellee never did so, and the matter went unnoticed until more than 120 days.\n. The Act enables an offender meeting certain conditions and requirements to become eligible for early release, but does not obviate the initial imposition of the minimum sentence. See id., \u00a7 4505(c)(1)-(2); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9756(b.1).\n. The sentencing guidelines recommend a standard-range minimum sentence of restorative sanctions to nine months for PWID where the defendant possesses less than ten pounds of marijuana and has an offense gravity score of five and a prior record score of zero. See 204 Pa.Code \u00a7 303.16(a) (Basic Sentencing Matrix).\n. Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance. 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-104(l)(iv).\n. See id., \u00a7 780-113(f)(2) (providing person who violates \u00a7 780-113(a)(30) with respect to Schedule I controlled substance is guilty of felony and upon conviction shall be sentenced to imprisonment not exceeding five years, or a fine not exceeding $15,000, or both).\n. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9762(a)(1) (providing \"[mjaximum terms of five or more years shall be committed to the Department of Corrections for confinement\").\n. Specifically, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1543(b) (relating to driving while operating privilege is suspended or revoked), 3731 (former) (relating to driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance), or 3804 (relating to penalties) for a first, second, or third offense under 75 Pa.C.S. Ch. 38 (relating to driving after imbibing alcohol or utilizing drugs).\n. This was the circumstance in Williams, supra, one of the cases the Superior Court relied on in affirming appellee\u2019s sentence.\n. As discussed in note 6, supra, the recommended standard-range sentence for appellee was restorative sanctions to nine months. See 204 Pa.Code \u00a7 303.16(a) (Basic Sentencing Matrix).\n. Specifically, the legislature added 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9756(b)(2) (permitting modification of minimum sentence) and 9756(b.l) (requiring trial court impose RRRI Act minimum sentence in addition to minimum sentence).\n. In Hansley, we rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that \u00a7\u00a7 6317 and 7508's special provisions controlled the RRRI Act\u2019s more general ones, noting such classification was \"mutable,\u201d as the RRRI Act pertained to a small subset of defendants and thus could also be considered special. Hansley, at 1189-90. We reasoned even if the RRRI Act was deemed the general statute, it was enacted later in time, and the legislature\u2019s intent that it control was manifest in the legislative design. Id., at 1190. Here, such classification is likewise \u201cmutable\u201d \u2014 in Hans-ley, we assumed \u00a7 7508 was the special provision, but it can be viewed as both special (pertaining to drug offenses) and general (prescribing mandatory minimum sentences). Therefore, we decline to use such nomenclature or employ a \"general vs. special\u201d analysis, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1933, when a reading of the statutes in pari materia resolves the issue."}
