It is alleged by the defendants that the court erred in the matters referred to in the specifications, and that the ouster complained of was unauthorized and unwarranted, The specifications do not convince us of error as claimed by the defendants but that the ouster entered by the learned judge of the court below was fully warranted. We therefore dismiss the appeal and affirm the judgment of the court.\nJudgment affirmed."}
