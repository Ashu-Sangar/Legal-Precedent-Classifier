{"id": "1019138", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, January 3d 1870, by\nRead, J. \u2014\nIn this case the auditor appointed by the Orphans\u2019 Court made a very able report, which we have examined with great care and attention. Alfred Campbell, one of the legatees of Rebecca Campbell the decedent, made a voluntary assignment of his legacy to a trustee for the use of his wife, Elvira Campbell. This instrument was dated 24th June 1863, but was not executed until several months afterwards, and was kept at Campbell\u2019s house, and was never in the possession of the trustee. Campbell was indebted upon a note for $4.75, dated December 1st 1862, payable nine months after date, for goods bought at the sale of personal property of decedents. Charles H. Hays had a judgment before Squire Gormly for $9,75, with interest from 18th February 1860, upon which an execution attachment was served on 4th November 1863, on the administrator as garnishee of Alfred Campbell. On the 17th March 1863, Alfred Campbell commenced suit against the administrator to recover an alleged claim coming to him from the estate, which he failed to sustain; and on the 16th March 1865, there was a verdict for defendant, on which judgment was entered on the 25th November 1865. The record costs were $42.06, and the defendant\u2019s bill $239.75, paid out of the estate by the administrator. Upon this judgment, an attachment execution was issued on December 16th 1865, and attached all moneys, &c., in the hands of the administrator, and summoned him as garnishee.\nIt was also in evidence that the constable who served the execution on Hays\u2019 judgment in 1863, could find no property out of which he could make the money, and it was returned \u201cno goods,\u201d and that he had another execution in favor of W. B. McGaffick, during the same year, and that was also returned \u201cno goods.\u201d\nCampbell appears to have been a thriftless man, without property of any kind, except the legacy which he assigned to his wife. This is only a general outline which is filled up by the auditor. He held the assignment void as against these debts, and directed them to be paid, and the balance to be paid to the trustee of the wife. The court below reversed this decision as regards the record, costs and defendant\u2019s bill, and decreed that the same should not be paid out of Alfred Campbell\u2019s legacy, and this is assigned for error.\nIn Coates v. Gerlach, 8 Wright 43, Judge Strong said (p. 46), \u201c upon this branch of the case it is conclusive against the wife, that the deed was for all the husband\u2019s real estate, and indeed for all his property, so far as appears, except some farming stock, subsequently sold by him for $500. A conveyance that denudes a husband of all, or the greater part, of his property, is much more than a reasonable provision for a wife; for in considering what is and what is not a reasonable provision, the circumstances of the husband are to be regarded \u2014 his probable necessities as well as his debts. Equity will not assist a wife to impoverish her husband \u2014 accordingly, it has always been held that a conveyance to a wife of all or the greater part of a husband\u2019s estate, is an unreasonable provision, which, if voluntary, a court of equity will not sustain. See 1 Fonblanque\u2019s Equity, Book 1, Ch. 4, \u00a7 12, note (a), where the author remarks that \u201c if a conveyance be of the whole or the greater part of a grantor\u2019s property, such conveyance or gift would be fraudulent; for no man can voluntarily divest himself of all or the most of what he has without being aware that future creditors will probably suffer by it: 2 Story\u2019s Eq. \u00a7 1374, where the principle is clearly stated, with all the authorities.\u201d\nThe same doctrine is to be found substantially in Larkin v. McMullin, 13 Wright 29, and in Mullen v. Wilson, 8 Id. 413. (See Ware v. Gardner, 38 L. J. N. S. Eq. 348, V. C. James and cases cited; Smith\u2019s Manual of Equity, p. 88, 89.) Peachey, in his, treatise on Marriage Settlements, p. 197, says \u201c It has, however, never been disputed but that a.subsequent creditor would participate in the benefit of a decree instituted by a prior creditor, and would have the same equity for having the property applied.. Again, no distinction has been drawn in such cases between the-different classes of creditors, that is, between those whose debts existed at the time the deed was executed, and those who became creditors subsequently, or that any priority can be given to those who were creditors at the date of the instrument over the subsequent creditors; all would, in fact, participate pro rata.\u201d\nThese authorities support the views taken by the auditor, which reach the real justice of the case, for it would be clearly unjust to suffer him, under cover of his wife, to evade the payment of the costs of an unsuccessful suit against his mother\u2019s estate, and to saddle them on his unoffending brothers and sisters.\nDecree reversed, and the report of the auditor confirmed, the costs to be paid out of the legacy to-Alfred Campbell.\nRecord remitted to Orphans\u2019 Court to carry out this-decree."}
