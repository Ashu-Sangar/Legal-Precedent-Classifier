{"id": "848215", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal by Edward Seifert is from the decree distributing the fund raised by the sale of J. B. Beam and Polly Beam\u2019s real estate on executions of D. J. Smyers and others.\nAn examination of the record with special reference to the assignments of error has failed to satisfy us that either of them should be sustained.\nSo far as the constitutionality of the act of May 18, 1887, is involved, that question has been settled by opinion just filed in Purvis et al. v. Ross, No. 36 of this term. [Reported above, page 20.]\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed, with costs to be paid by the appellant, Edward Seifert."}
