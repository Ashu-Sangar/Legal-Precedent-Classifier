{"id": "1057699", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe testator signed his name at the lower right-hand corner of a piece of paper, immediately under the end of the following sentence: \u201cThis is my Will this third day of December 1914.\u201d To the left of his signature, and on a line with it, he wrote: \u201cI Have a note of C. A. Rouzer for $4000.00,\u201d and immediately below this he inserted, in his own handwriting: \u201cReceipt of $115.00 against Mrs. Rose Bonebreak.\u201d From an inspection of the will, which was submitted to us on this appeal, the correct conclusions of the learned court below were: (1) That the two foregoing expressions formed no part of it, which the act of assembly required to be signed at its end; and (2) That they were not of testamentary character, but simply statements of facts, without' application to the disposition which the testator made of his estate. The decree eliminating them from the will as admitted to probate by the register is affirmed, at the costs of the appellant.\nDecree affirmed."}
