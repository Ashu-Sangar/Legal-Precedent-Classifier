{"id": "1920963", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThis is an appeal from the Order of the Court of Common Pleas sustaining appellee\u2019s preliminary objections to appellant Marianne\u2019s claim for damages for loss of her husband\u2019s consortium.\nMaurice deAngeli filed a complaint in trespass seeking to recover damages for (a) loss of wages and medical bills and (b) pain and suffering and (c) repairs to his car arising out of a collision with appellee\u2019s car. Marianne deAngeli, appellant herein, was named as a party plaintiff in her husband\u2019s trespass action in order that she might recover damages for loss of her husband\u2019s consortium. Marianne\u2019s consortium claim was averred to be for less than $10,000.\nAppellee filed preliminary objections to appellant\u2019s consortium claim, on the ground that such a claim was not recognized by the law. Brown v. Glenside Lumber and Coal Company, 429 Pa. 601, 240 A. 2d 822; Neuberg v. Bobowicz, 401 Pa. 146, 162 A. 2d 662. The lower Court dismissed the claim for consortium and ordered that it be expunged from the complaint.\nIt is clear that the Order of the lower Court which not only sustained appellee\u2019s preliminary objections but dismissed the plaintiff-wife\u2019s consortium claim is a final Order and therefore appealable. Brandywine A. J. School Authority v. VanCor, Inc., 426 Pa. 448, 451, 233 A. 2d 240; see, also, Sullivan v. Philadelphia, 378 Pa. 648, 107 A. 2d 854.\nHowever, the amount of damages claimed by the plaintiff-wife for loss of consortium is less than flO,000 and therefore appellate jurisdiction is in the Superior Court. Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 212, \u00a77(c), as amended, August 14, 1963, P. L. 819, \u00a71, 17 P.S. \u00a7184 (Supp.) 1963. Morris v. Board of Property Assessment, 417 Pa. 192, 209 A. 2d 407.\nCase remitted to the Superior Court, appellant to pay costs."}
