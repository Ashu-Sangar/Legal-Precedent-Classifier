There was evidence tending to prove that fact, and the learned auditing judge undertook to determine what proportion thereof should be charged to the estate; and, having done so, that amount was allowed without prejudice to appellant\u2019s claim against the executors individually for services rendered for their personal benefit. The facts were found by the auditing judge and approved by the court. There has been nothing shown to justify us in reversing, either as to the findings of fact, clearly stated in the opinion of the learned auditing judge, or the conclusions drawn therefrom. On the contrary, for reasons there given at length the decree should be affirmed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of appellant.\nSMYTH AND KER\u2019S APPEAL.\nPer Curiam:\nThis case was argued with No. 174 of the same term, and ( involves substantially the same question.
