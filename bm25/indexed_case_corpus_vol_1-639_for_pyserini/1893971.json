{"id": "1893971", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThe Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review introduced in evidence in the lower Court its record of assessment of appellant\u2019s property, with a breakdown thereof into a valuation of land, and of machinery, and of the building thereon. That Court ruled that the records of the Board made out a prima facie case, and this had not been overcome by the taxpayer\u2019s evidence of the value of the building.\nThe Court further found that the evidence produced by the taxpayer did not show that the assessment exceeded the market value of the property, or of the building, or proved a lack of uniformity. It is obvious that the Court did not believe the taxpayer\u2019s evidence as to the value of the building, and for this reason (among others) we find no abuse of discretion or error of law in the Court\u2019s dismissal of the appeal.\nOrder affirmed."}
