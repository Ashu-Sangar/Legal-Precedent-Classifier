{"id": "1778869", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nOn October 13, 1978 at approximately 12:00 a.m. one Wylie A. Howie was stabbed to death in a Philadelphia bar. Appellant was accused of this crime and was brought to trial before a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On May 24, 1979, he was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. This appeal was taken from that conviction and sentence.\nThe facts of the case are as follows. When police officer Isreal Raynor, in response to a radio call, arrived at Jake\u2019s Lounge, the scene of the crime, at approximately 12:30 a.m., he encountered two young women coming out of the door. The officer asked one of the women, Lisa Heard, what had happened, and she told him that a dark complexioned Negro male, of slender build with a medium bush haircut, approximately eighteen to twenty years of age and wearing a green army jacket had stabbed the victim. She told him that although she did not see the stabbing itself, the victim and the suspect had been standing at the bar together talking, and she saw the suspect folding something that looked like a knife just as the victim backed away from the suspect saying that he had been stabbed. She added that although she did not know the suspect personally, she had been told that his name was Sonny. An unidentified woman who was with Ms. Heard added, \u201cYou know, Black Sonny.\u201d\nOfficer Raynor had been assigned to this particular neighborhood for fourteen years, knew Ms. Heard, the witness, was familiar with this bar, and had known the appellant for five years. He testified during the suppression hearing that Ms. Heard\u2019s physical description of the suspect suggested to him that the appellant was the person she was describing and that her statement of the suspect\u2019s name confirmed his view that appellant was the person described. Further, during the week prior to the stabbing, he had seen the appellant wearing a green army jacket. Approximately one month later, on November 6, 1978, Officer Raynor arrested appellant without a warrant after seeing him on a street corner. After appellant was arrested and transported to the homicide division, appellant was warned of his rights and gave a voluntary inculpatory statement to police which was introduced as evidence at trial. The first issue raised is whether appellant\u2019s statement to police should have been suppressed because his arrest was without probable cause.\nAppellant\u2019s claim is that Officer Raynor would not have been able to connect appellant with the crime in the absence of Ms. Heard\u2019s statement that she had been told that the suspect\u2019s name was \u201cSonny,\u201d and her companion\u2019s comment, \u201cYou know, Black Sonny.\u201d The argument is that the witnesses\u2019 information is hearsay and may not be used to establish probable cause to arrest unless the information meets the two pronged tests of Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964) and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S.Ct. 584, 21 L.Ed.2d 637 (1969) requiring (1) the officer must know some of the underlying circumstances from which the informer concluded that the suspect participated in the crime and (2) the officer must have some reasonable basis for concluding that the informant is credible or his information is reliable.\nApplying the Aguilar-Spinelli criteria to this case, the specific challenges to the arrest are (1) because the officer did not know Ms. Heard\u2019s last name, but knew her only as Lisa, and because the woman who volunteered that appellant\u2019s name was Black Sonny was anonymous, there is insufficient indicia of Aguilar-Spinelli credibility of witnesses and reliability of their information to establish probable cause. (2) Even if Ms. Heard and the second witness had been identified, the information that the suspect\u2019s name was Sonny or Black Sonny fails both of the Aguilar-Spinelli tests in that it was hearsay information coming from an unknown source, and thus was inherently unreliable, and could not be utilized to bolster the general description to establish probable cause.\nThe brief answer to these claims is that the AguilarSpinelli test is not applicable to this case because there was a substantial basis for crediting the information given by the informer. As this Court stated in Commonwealth v. Stokes:\nin order to arrest without a warrant, the officer must have a reasonable belief in the probability of criminal activity by the person to be arrested. However, that belief need not be grounded in the officer\u2019s direct, personal knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances. It may, instead, rest solely on information supplied by another person where there is a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for crediting that information.\n480 Pa. 38, 43-44, 389 A.2d 74, 76 (1978), citing United States v. Harris, 403 U.S. 573, 91 S.Ct. 2075, 29 L.Ed.2d 723 (1971). In the present case the substantial basis was that (1) the information was supplied by an eyewitness; (2) the physical description alone given by this eyewitness, which was detailed and conformed to the description of a person whom the officer knew to live in the area, was adequate to establish probable cause, thus eliminating a need to determine whether the hearsay information (as to the actor\u2019s name) was sufficiently reliable.\nThe significance of the fact that the informant in the present case was a disinterested eyewitness is, as this Court stated in Commonwealth v. Stokes, \u201cwe have tended to credit information supplied by one who has some direct personal knowledge of the crime.\u201d 480 Pa. at 44, 398 A.2d at 77. There is a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for crediting such information. Further, such a position is self-evidently consistent with the first part of the Agailar-Spinelli requirements that the magistrate or officer know the underlying circumstances from which the informer concluded that the suspect participated in the crime. If a person has witnessed a crime, the act of witnessing is the circumstance from which he concludes that the suspect participated in the crime.\nBut even if we were to treat appellant\u2019s claim as requiring a,n Aguilar-Spinelli analysis (because the information contained a hearsay element), it would fail. In addressing the first argument that the witnesses are not credible (because one is anonymous and the arresting officer did not know the last name of the other) and their information is therefore unreliable, it must be observed that Officer Ray-nor knew Ms. Heard prior to the stabbing incident, although he did not know her last name. She was, therefore, an identified eyewitness and was reliable as to what she saw. The fact that an unnamed eyewitness offered additional information as to the suspect\u2019s identity which tended to corroborate Ms. Heard\u2019s physical description does not make Ms. Heard\u2019s physical description unreliable, See Commonwealth v. Sudler, 496 Pa. 295, 436 A.2d 1376 (1981) (probable cause to issue search warrant was present where only one of two informants was named in the affidavit in support of request for a search warrant and there was no reason to believe that the other informant was not credible and reliable); nor, as is discussed below, does it make unreliable the physical description in combination with the name.\nThe second prong of appellant\u2019s attack is that the account of events and the physical description supplied by the named witness is insufficient to establish probable cause and that the remaining information as to the suspect\u2019s name, Sonny or Black Sonny, is hearsay and may not be grafted onto the competent information (eyewitness description of physical characteristics) to bolster it and thereby establish probable cause. Presumably the underlying argument is that the hearsay is or may be inaccurate.\nFirst, this argument fails because the physical description of the suspect was in itself adequate to establish probable cause for arrest. But even where the physical description is inadequate, as we stated last year in the Sudler case:\nIn a case where two independent sources of information were presented which, \u201cstanding alone, arguably [did] not possess a sufficient guarantee of reliability to create the probable cause necessary to issue a search warrant,\u201d this Court held:\n\u201cWhen two independent informants both supply the same information about a particular crime to the police, each source tends inherently to bolster the reliability of the other. Although the information supplied by one questionable source may be insufficient, the probability is extremely small that a second independent source would supply identical information if it were not probably accurate.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Mamon, 449 Pa. 249, 259, 297 A.2d 471, 477 (1972).\n496 Pa. at 305-06, 436 A.2d at 1381. In the present case, the information supplied by the different informants (Ms. Heard, the unknown person who told Ms. Heard suspect\u2019s name, and Ms. Heard\u2019s anonymous companion, who commented that the suspect\u2019s name was Black Sonny) was not \u201cidentical\u201d in that Ms. Heard\u2019s information was a general description of the actor and the challenged information was a name. However, in Mam\u00f3n the information was similarly non-identical: in that case two witnesses said that appellant was seen entering the garage of the murder victim shortly before the murder; and a third witness, who entered the house and was herself the victim of an attempted murder, stated that appellant was her assailant. Thus, the information, while different, was \u201cidentical\u201d in that it pointed to appellant as the murderer. That is also the situation in this case: both the description and the alleged name of the suspect coincide to point to the same person. As we concluded in Mam\u00f3n, \u201cacting together, each [source of information] complements the other sufficiently to produce the reliability necessary to create probable cause.\u201d 449 Pa. at 260, 297 A.2d at 477. It was not error, therefore, to admit the police statement, for there was adequate indicia of accuracy in the witness statements given police to establish probable cause for the arrest.\nIn cases of this type, it is well to remember that our inquiry as to reliability and trustworthiness concerns a kind of common sense approach to probabilities inherent in the situation. As the United States Supreme Court has stated, in dealing with the question of whether police knowledge of a suspect\u2019s reputation for criminal activity could be used to support a determination of probable cause to arrest:\nSuch evidence would rarely be admissible at trial, but the Court [in Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949)] took pains to emphasize the very different functions of criminal trials and preliminary determinations of probable cause. Trials are necessarily surrounded with evidentiary rules \u201cdeveloped to safeguard men from dubious and unjust convictions.\u201d Id. at 174, [69 S.Ct. at 1310], 93 L.Ed. at 1889. But before the trial we deal only with probabilities that \u201care not technical; they are the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.\u201d Brinegar, supra, at 175 [69 S.Ct. at 1310], 93 L.Ed. at 1890.\nUnited States v. Harris, 403 U.S. at 582, 91 S.Ct. at 2081, 29 L.Ed.2d at 733 (1971).\nOn the one hand, we must protect our citizens from groundless police intrusions; on the other, it is destructive of the entire concept of an ordered society to prohibit arrests and searches when police have been given probably reliable information from a probably trustworthy source. If there is a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for the belief that a particular person has committed a crime, see United States v. Harris, supra, as there is when an eyewitness gives a detailed physical description of the actor, there is probable cause for an arrest.\nAffirmed.\nLARSEN, J., concurs in the result.\nAppellant also raises three further claims: (1) the prosecutor made improper remarks during closing argument and a new trial is required; (2) it was error to try appellant before a death qualified jury; (3) the evidence was insufficient to convict of first degree murder. After a careful examination of the record, we conclude that these further assertions of error are also without merit."}
