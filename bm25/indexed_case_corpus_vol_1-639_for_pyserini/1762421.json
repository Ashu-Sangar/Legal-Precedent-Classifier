{"id": "1762421", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nOn July 1, 1977, appellant, Reginald Marks, was convicted of third degree murder in connection with a fatal shooting following an altercation in the parking lot of a bar. Appellant presents three arguments on appeal: (1) that trial counsel was subject to a conflict of interest; (2) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a third degree murder conviction; and (3) that appellant\u2019s sentence reconsideration hearing was inadequate.\nAfter careful review of the briefs and record, we have found these arguments to be without merit.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., concurs in the result."}
