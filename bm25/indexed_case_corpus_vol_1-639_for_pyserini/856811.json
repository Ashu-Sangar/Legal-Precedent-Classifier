{"id": "856811", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis case depends upon the proper construction of the act of June 8, 1891, and is ruled by Commonwealth v. Wilkes-Barre & Scranton Railway Co., Apt., No. 19 of this term [the preceding case.] In that case the judgment of the common pleas has just been affirmed on the opinion of the learned president of that court; and, inasmuch as the questions presented in both cases are substantially the same, the judgment in this case should be affirmed for the reasons given at length in said opinion.\nJudgment affirmed."}
