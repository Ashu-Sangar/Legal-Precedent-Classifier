{"id": "1926131", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Eagen,\nArthur Ovens, a resident of Lackawanna County, died testate on November 21, 1965. His will was probated in the office of the Register of Wills on November 29th and letters testamentary were issued on the same date to his wife as the executrix of his estate.\nAt the time of his death Ovens was the registered owner of a transportation business known as \u201cOvens Motor Freight.\u201d On September 15, 1966, Victor Eberhardt filed a complaint in equity in the Court of Common Pleas claiming that he was a partner in \u201cOvens Motor Freight\u201d and, as the surviving partner, had the exclusive right to wind up the business. After a hearing, the chancellor filed an adjudication finding that Ovens and Eberhardt owned the business under a partnership agreement at the time of Ovens\u2019 death and entered a decree nisi granting relief to Eberhardt consistent with the adjudication. Subsequently, exceptions to the adjudication and decree nisi were dismissed by the court en banc, and the chancellor\u2019s decree was made final. This appeal followed. We will vacate the decree and dismiss the proceedings.\nSection 301 of the Orphans\u2019 Court Act of 1951, P. L. 1163, 20 P.S. \u00a72080.301,' pertinently provides: \u201cThe orphans\u2019 court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of: . . . (13) The adjudication of the title to personal property in the possession of the personal representative, or registered in the name of the decedent or his nominee . . . .\u201d The comment to this section states that the provision is \u201cintended to obviate, whenever possible, a preliminary dispute as to whether the Orphans\u2019 Court has jurisdiction to determine title to the disputed property.\u201d Since the instant case involves the question of whether Eberhardt owns part of what appeared to be the property of the decedent, Ovens, i.e., his business, the foregoing section of the Orphans\u2019 Court Act applies and exclusive jurisdiction to resolve the controversy is in the Orphans\u2019 Court. See Pope v. Dascher, 429 Pa. 576, 240 A. 2d 518 (1968), and Tallarico v. Bellotti, 414 Pa. 535, 200 A. 2d 763 (1964).\nAlthough the case was argued on the merits in this Court and equity\u2019s jurisdiction was not questioned here or below, we conclude that the issue should be raised sua sponte. See and cf. Commonwealth ex rel. Ransom v. Mascheska, 429 Pa. 168, 239 A. 2d 386 (1968), and Balazick v. Dunkard-Bobtown Municipal Authority, 414 Pa. 182, 199 A. 2d 430 (1964).\nDecree vacated and proceedings dismissed. Each party to pay own costs.\nNone of the business records of \u201cOvens Motor Freight\u2019\u2019 or reports to the ICC or PUC disclosed the existence of any such partnership."}
