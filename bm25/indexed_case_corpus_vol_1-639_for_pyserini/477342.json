{"id": "477342", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearns,\nThis is an appeal from a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Lackawanna County sustaining an appeal from a decree of the Register of Wills refusing to probate paper writings purporting to be the will and codicil of the late Judge M. F. Sando who, for many years, was President Judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court of that county.\nDecedent died on September 10, 1945. A week or ten days after the death an envelope was found in decedent\u2019s locked roll top desk in his court chambers, in which was the questioned will and codicil, fastened by permanent metal eyelets with a backer or manuscript cover on which was typed \u201cWill of M. F. Sando, Will and Codicil.\u201d Both papers were signed by decedent and the codicil was witnessed by two individuals who proved their signatures. In the envelope were also found three unsigned memoranda, in decedent\u2019s handwriting, attached to the will and codicil by a moveable paper clip. In the envelope the will of decedent\u2019s widow was also found.\nThe will and codicil had penciled marks of obliterations and cancellations thereon and read as follows:\n\u201cI, M. F. Sando, of the city of Scranton, County of Lackawanna and state of Pennsylvania, being of sound mind, memory and understanding, do make, publish and declare this to be my last will and testament, hereby revoking and making void any and all former wills by me at any time heretofore made.\n\u201cFIRST: I direct that all my just debts and funeral expenses be in the first place fully paid and satisfied.\n\u201cSECOND: As to all-the-restTrosidue and remainder of -my-estato; \u25a0 bo the samo' real-,\u25a0\u25a0 personal- or mixcd-j-or whoresoever-sitaatc or to \u25a0 which I- -may-in-any -wa-y--be entitled at the time of my death-, \u2014 I give, devise and-foe-q-neath-to my-two sons, JoaephBr Sando-mid Francis B. &a-ndo-an4-my--granddftuglitor, Eleanor Sando, to bodi-vided-eq-ually among thorn, share and share- alike; to bo (-heirs,--their hoirs-a-nd-assigna forever:\nwife Mary L. Sando\n\u201cI nominate, constitute and appoint my son, Francis B.- Sando- and M. J. Moffitt to be the executors of this my last will and testament, -and-direct them to convert all-of my real-estate -into-eafili-ae-Boett-aftcr my death as-may be, for the-besfe-priee-obt-a-inablc for the same, and-I-hereby- authorise and empower my said executors to sell, assign-transfer- and-sot ovor-any -and -all -of-m-y roa-i-estflto, and--to make geed-and sufficient deeds for same, as I myself could do-if living.\n\u201cIN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and seal this 19th day of March, 1935.\n\u201cSigned,-sealed; published and declared, by: the. above named testator, as; and for his last W\u00cdU ; and. testament, in the presence of us, who at his request and in - his presence and in the presence of each other have hereunto subscribed opr .names, as witnesses.\n- M. F. Sando (Seal)\nUnder Section 20(a) of the Wills Act of June 7,1917, P. L. 403, 20 PS 271, a will may be revoked by \u201c. . ; cancelling; obliterating, or destroying ... by the testator.\". '. .\u201d Cancellation and revocation of a bequest are effected by lines drawn thereon: Heller Estate, 158 Pa. Superior Ct. 194, 44 A. 2d 528. As the decedent had custody of the will it is presumed the cancellation was the act of decedent: Baptist Church v. Robbarts, 2 Pa. 110; Wood\u2019s Estate, 247 Pa. 377, 93 A. 483; Heller Estate, supra. The undestroyed part of a will, complete in itself, is probatable as the will of the testator: Sheaffer's Estate, 240 Pa. 83, 87 A. 577.\nThe uncancelled portion of the will revokes all other wills, directs payment .of debts and, funeral expenses and appoints executors.- A.Avriting appointing an executor is a Avill though no disposition is made of the estate: Rose v. Quick, 30 Pa. 225; Douglas\u2019s Estate, 303 Pa. 227, 154 A. 376. As, there is'no disposition of the residue an intestacy results, by implication. The omission may not be regarded as accidental. It may .have been the deliberate act of testator. As the late Judge Penrose, of the Philadelphia Orphans\u2019 Court-, said in WundeCs Estate, 13 District Reports 197, 198: \u201cWe have no right to assume that the absence of a residuary clause was an acci-r dent. . . .\u201d See: DeSilver\u2019s Estate, 142 Pa. 74, 21 A. 882; Nebinger\u2019s Estate, 185 Pa. 399, 403, 39 A. 1049; Corr\u2019s Estate, 202 Pa. 391, 51 A. 1032.\nThe codicil reads as follows:\n\u201cIrM-:' Fr-Sando, of thcc4ty--e{--Soi\u2018anton, Oounkf-e# Lackawanna and State-oJv&nkp-being-\u25a0 of soundmin4-f--n^m\u00abry--arn4--aiidor8tanding)''\u20194e-'niakOj publish endkdeel#i^iiin4e4se-\u00abre64ieil4e-4ny^flnkw4ti-BB4r4eet9r\n\u201cSecond -Ewsk: I give, devise and bequeath to St. Patrick\u2019s Orphanage of Scranton, Pennsylvania, the sum of Twenty-five Hundred Dollars, ,($2,500.00).\n\u201cThird-Seesnd-:' I give, devise and bequeath to St. Joseph\u2019s Children\u2019s and Maternity Hospital, commonly known as The' Foundling Home, located in the Borough of Dunmore, County of Lackawanna and State of Pennsylvania, the sum of Twenty-five Hundred Dollars (.$2,-500.00).\n\u201cFourth \u2022Tk-kai-: I give, devise and bequeath to the Little Sisters of .the Poor, commonly known as The Maloney Home, located in Scranton, Pa. the sum of Twenty-five Hundred Dollars ($2,500.00).\n\u201cIn all other respects I ratify and confirm my.said will dated March 19, 1935.\n\u201cIN WITNESS WHEREOF I have hereunto set my hand and seal this _21 day of June, 1944.\n\u201cSigned, sealed, published and declared by the above named testator as and for a codicil to his last will and testament, in the presence of us, who at his request, and in his presence and in the presence of each other, have hereunto subscribed our names as witnesses hereto.\nM.F. Sando' (Seal)\nM. J. Moffitt\nJohn Kozak.\nAs this writing is signed and witnessed by proven signatures it is entitled to be probated as a codicil to the will which it purports to amend.\nThe three unsigned memoranda on separate pieces of paper are not connected in their internal sense and were not even fastened to the will and codicil except by the moveable nonmutilating paper clips. They therefore formed no part of testator\u2019s will: Baker\u2019s Estate, 331 Pa. 33, 200 A. 2d 65; Baldwin Will, 357 Pa. 432, 55 A. 2d 263.\nAppellants, the sons of testator, maintain that the cancellation and obliteration, while partial, nevertheless indicate an intention of decedent to revoke the entire testamentary document and to die intestate. It is argued that testator\u2019s remarriage after the date of the codicil and the physical situation of the papers offered for probate indicate and strengthen such intent. Great reliance is placed upon the decision of this Court in Evans\u2019s Appeal, 58 Pa. 238. It is true that in that case it was held that the destruction by cancellation was complete even though fragments of the will remained, but there was a line drawn through the signature which alone revoked the will. Burtt Will, 353 Pa. 217, 44 A. 2d 670, has no application to the present one. There the question related to the revival of a revoked will. As the writings offered for probate complied with the provisions of section 2 of the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 403, 20 PS 191, such writing may not be revoked by parol. Any oral evidence of testator\u2019s expressed intention was therefore properly excluded.\nDecree affirmed at cost of appellants."}
