{"id": "1751143", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nIn June, 1977, the April 1977 Special Investigating Grand Jury was impaneled in Philadelphia with Judge Edwin S. Maimed as the presiding judge. The charge of the grand jury is to investigate allegations of criminal conduct in connection with charitable fund raising activities in Philadelphia and contains the following descriptions of the types of criminal conduct to be investigated:\n\u201c1. Charitable fund raising on behalf of sham or non-existent charities.\n\u201c2. Charitable fund raising on behalf of legitimate charities where:\n\u201ca. The charities receive no percentage of the proceeds or less than they are entitled to under Solicitation of Charitable Funds Act.\n\u201cb. The charities do not receive a proper accounting of the proceeds.\n\u201cc. The charities receive a flat, fixed sum, less than they are entitled to under the Solicitation of Charitable Funds Act.\n\u201c3. Charitable fund raising purportedly on behalf of legitimate charities where the charities have not authorized or received any proceeds from their fund raising.\n\u201c4. The fraudulent conduct of charitable fund raising purportedly on behalf of legitimate charities.\n\u201c5. Sham charities and fraudulent fund raising.\n\u201c6. Fraudulent solicitation of advertising books, etc., purportedly on behalf of legitimate fraternal orders.\u201d\nThe grand jury conducted an investigation into the operations of B & R Associates, a Pennsylvania corporation, which is engaged in charitable fund raising in Philadelphia.\nOn April 5, 1978, appellant, Alan Massey, an employee of B & R Associates, appeared before the investigating grand jury pursuant to a subpoena. Massey exercised his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to testify before the grand jury.\nBecause of Massey\u2019s refusal to testify, on August 2, 1978, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania filed a petition to grant immunity to Alan Massey. This grant of immunity was sought under the authority of the Act of November 22, 1968, P.L. 1080, No. 333, \u00a7 1, et seq., 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.1-6 (Supp.1978). The petition for immunity contained the following averments:\n\u201c2. For the past several months, the Grand Jury has investigated inter alia the fund-raising activities of B & R Associates. This investigation has revealed evidence of a systematic and organized conspiracy to fraudulently obtain charitable contributions from members of the community.\n\u201c3. On April 5,1978, Alan Massey, an employee of B & R Associates, appeared before the Grand Jury, and refused to answer any questions regarding his employment at B & R Associates on Fifth Amendment grounds.\n\u201c4. It is necessary that the Court grant Alan Massey immunity as provided by the Act of November 22, 1968, P.L. 1080, No. 333, \u00a7 1 et seq.; 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.1 et seq. for the following reasons:\n\u201c(a) Alan Massey is reasonably believed to possess, as a result of his employment as an Office Manager and \u2018Collector\u2019 at B & R Associates, knowledge and evidence of systematic and organized thefts, conspiracy, and other related crimes in connection with fraudulent charitable fund-raising perpetrated by B & R Associates, its President and employees.\n\u201c(b) The Grand Jury has further reliable information that Alan Massey has knowledge of the record-keeping system and the contents of the business records of B & R Associates. It is believed that these records reveal additional evidence of systematic thefts, conspiracy and related crimes. Mr. Massey\u2019s testimony in this regard is especially necessary, since the Custodian of Records of B & R Associates, Barry Arno, refused to comply with the Grand Jury\u2019s subpoena to produce certain of these records and was held in criminal contempt of Court, on May 10, 1978, as a result thereof. Accordingly, the Grand Jury may be precluded from obtaining this essential evidence without Mr. Massey\u2019s testimony.\u201d\nMassey filed a motion with the court below to dismiss the immunity petition. On August 2, 1978, the court held a hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for immunity and appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss.\nOn August 30, 1978, the court below granted Massey \u201cimmunity\u201d pursuant to the Act of November 22, 1968, supra. The court then stayed its order of immunity and certified controlling questions of law, the resolution of which would materially advance the ultimate end of the proceedings. See Judicial Code, \u00a7 7Q2, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 702 (formerly the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31,1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. I, \u00a7 101, et seq., 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.101, et seq.)\nOn September 8, 1978, Massey filed with this Court a petition for permission to appeal from an interlocutory order granting immunity and a petition for review of said order. On September 22, 1978, the Commonwealth filed its answer to these petitions. On October 12, 1978, this Court, in a per curiam order, granted the September 8 petitions of Massey. (Mr. Justice O\u2019Brien and Mr. Justice Roberts noted dissents.) On November 14, 1978, the case was argued before this Court (Mr. Justice Pomeroy did not participate.)\nAppellant first argues that the proceedings before the April, 1977 Special Investigating Grand Jury do not relate to \u201corganized crime\u201d or \u201cracketeering,\u201d as those terms are defined in the Act of November 22, 1968, supra. We do not agree.\nSection 640.6 provides:\n\u201cAs used in this act\u2014\n\u201c \u2018Organized crime\u2019 and \u2018racketeering\u2019 shall include, but not be limited to, conspiracy to commit murder, bribery or extortion, narcotic or dangerous drug violations, prostitution, usury, subornation of perjury and lottery, bookmaking or other forms of organized gambling.\u201d Act of November 22, 1968, P.L. 1080, No. 333, \u00a7 6, 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.6.\nIn Commonwealth v. Brady, 470 Pa. 420, 432-33, 368 A.2d 699 (1977), this Court discussed the above definition:\n. . Rather, we are inclined to believe that it is when such acts are the end product of an \u2018unlawful agreement \u2019 that constitute the evil sought to be eradicated by the legislature. Thus,- on the basis of the obvious legislative intention to reach organized, concerted activity, and the plain meaning of the language of Section 6, it is clear that before the authority to confer immunity arises under the Act, there must be a conspiracy to commit any of the substantive offenses as set forth in Section 6.\n\u201cThe Commonwealth also asserts, however, that the language of Section 6 \u2018shall include, but not be limited to,\u2019 implies that the legislature must have intended to reach the substantive offenses as well, including others not specifically enumerated in the Act. We agree that the legislature may have foreseen that it could not specifically identify all substantive offenses relating to organized crime, and we therefore agree that the legislature did not limit the [Act\u2019s] applicability to conspiracies to commit only the enumerated crimes. However, we also believe that the legislature intended only to provide sufficient latitude to reach conspiracies [emphasis in original] for any such unenumerated offenses relating to organized crime. We therefore cannot accept the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that this language indicates a legislative intention to reach something less than concerted activity.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThe majority of the Court in Brady determined that the terms \u201corganized crime\u201d and \u201cracketeering\u201d related to conspiracies/\u201cconcerted activities\u201d to commit crimes enumerated in \u00a7 640.6 of the act as well as crimes not enumerated in the act. However, the statutory wording of \u00a7 640.6, supra, and the analysis of this Court in Brady do not fully clarify what is meant by \u201corganized crime\u201d and \u201cracketeering\u201d in relation to grants of immunity. We believe an additional clarifying element must be included in discussing whether an Attorney General has access to the immunity statute before an investigating grand jury.\nWe further believe that the factors necessary for the impaneling of an investigating grand jury should be used to delineate the types of conspiracies or concerted activities classified as organized crime for purposes of the Act of November 22, 1968.\nIn the case of In Re: Jan. 1974 Phila. Co. Gr. Jury Inv., 458 Pa. 586, 600, 328 A.2d 485 (1974), this Court listed the following criteria for the impaneling of an investigating grand jury:\n\u201c. . .In McNair\u2019s Petition this Court set forth seven criteria which must be met to justify a grand jury investigation: (1) such an investigation must have a definite purpose to uncover criminal acts which seriously affect or injure the public generally; (2) the investigation may not be aimed at individuals nor at the commission of ordinary crimes, but should be matters of a criminal nature wherein public officers or the interests of the general public are involved; (3) the ordinary processes of the law must be inadequate to cope with or discover such offenses; (4) the acts must be part of a criminal conspiracy, systematic, or of a widespread nature; (5) at least one or more cognate offenses must exist upon which to base the general investigation; (6) the criminal acts being investigated must require immediate attention; and (7) the court must have reasonable cause from direct knowledge or knowledge gained from trustworthy information to believe that an investigation will disclose some criminal conduct which is within the competence of the .grand jury to investigate and within the jurisdiction of the court to punish. 324 Pa. [48] at 61-62, 187 A. [498] at 506. . .\nOur judicial interpretation of the immunity statute would provide that \u201corganized crime\u201d or \u201cracketeering\u201d be defined as conspiracies to commit any of the enumerated crimes in \u00a7 640.6 or conspiracies to commit unenumerated crimes as permitted by Brady, supra, if such conspiracies:\n1. Seriously affect or injure the public generally.\n2. Are matters of a criminal nature wherein public officers or the interests of the general public are involved.\n3. Are so widespread that the ordinary criminal process cannot handle or discover such offenses.\n4. Are systematic and/or widespread.\n5. Require immediate attention or investigation by law enforcement authorities.\nWe believe the above judicial interpretation serves both the public interest in combating widespread \u201corganized crime\u201d and \u201cracketeering\u201d and adequately protects an individual\u2019s rights and society\u2019s interests against possible abuses in grand jury investigations and granting of immunity to witnesses.\nIn the instant case, the Attorney General, in his petition for immunity, and the Philadelphia District Attorney, in his petition to empanel a special investigating grand jury, and the charge of the grand jury itself enumerate sufficient allegations of widespread, systematic groups of conspiracies, whose purpose is to defraud both the public and responsible legitimate charitable endeavors by operating fraudulent charities or fundraising campaigns. The record in this case meets the requirements of \u00a7 640.6 of the Act of November 22,1968 and the relevant criteria adopted from In Re Jan. 1974 Phila. Co. Gr. Jury, supra, concerning the definition of \u201corganized crime\u201d and \u201cracketeering.\u201d\nWe are of the opinion that the petition for immunization for Alan Massey was properly granted. Appellant asks this Court to adopt as a judicial interpretation of \u201corganized crime\u201d and \u201cracketeering\u201d the Pennsylvania Crime Commission\u2019s definition of \u201corganized crime\u201d as set forth in its 1970 . report on organized crime. We do not accept appellant\u2019s request.\nThe report provides in pertinent part:\n\u201cThe President\u2019s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice has described organized crime as\n\u201ca society that seeks to operate outside the control of the American people and their governments. It involves thousands of criminals, working within structures as complex as those of any large corporation, subject to laws more rigidly enforced than those of legitimate governments. Its actions are not impulsive but rather the result of intricate conspiracies, carried on over many years and aimed at gaining control over whole fields of activity in order to amass huge profits.\n\u201cIn 1967 a conference convened at Oyster Bay, New York, with legal, judicial, and academic specialists in attendance, concurred in the following definition:\n\u201cOrganized crime is the product of a self-perpetuating criminal conspiracy to wring exorbitant profits from our society by any means \u2014 fair and foul, legal and illegal .. It survives on fear and corruption. By one or another means, it obtains a high degree of immunity from the law. It is totalitarian in organization. A way of life, it imposes rigid discipline on underlings who do the dirty work while the top men of organized crime are generally insulated from the criminal act and the consequent danger of prosecution.\u201d\nWe are of the opinion that the Crime Commission\u2019s report is of no help in delineating workable guidelines to define organized crime. The report\u2019s definition is descriptive but of no help in understanding the issues before this court.\nMoreover, a majority of this court in Brady, supra, rejected the use of subsequent legislation to define organized crime in \u00a7 640.6, supra. The same rationale would apply to the proffered 1970 Crime Commission\u2019s report, as it postdates the Act of November 22, 1968, supra. See Brady, supra, 470 Pa. at p. 433, 368 A.2d 699.\nAppellant next argues that, even assuming arguendo that the activities in this case could be classified as \u201corganized crime\u201d or \u201cracketeering,\u201d the court below erred because the grant of immunity was not co-extensive with provisions of the Act of November 22, 1968. We do not agree.\nSection 640.3 provides:\n\u201cNo such witness shall be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture nor shall there be any liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against any such witness for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing concerning which he is compelled, after having claimed his privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence, nor shall testimony so compelled be used as evidence in any criminal proceeding against him in any court.\u201d Act of November 22, 1968, P.L. 1080, No. 333, \u00a7 3, 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.3.\nOn August 29, 1978, the court below entered the following order granting immunity to appellant:\n\u201cAND NOW, to wit this_of_ 1978, upon consideration of the within petition and on motion of GERALD GORNISH, Attorney General of Pennsylvania, and EDWARD G. RENDELL, District Attorney of Philadelphia County, ALAN MASSEY is hereby ordered to testify as a witness before the April, 1977 Special Investigating Grand . Jury of the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; and in accordance with the provisions of the Act of November 22, 1968, P.L. 1080, No. 333, \u00a7 1, et seq.; 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.1, et seq., he shall be immune from prosecution for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled to give testimony or produce evidence and further that no testimony so compelled shall be used as evidence against him in any criminal or other proceedings in any court. Said immunity shall not, however, extend to any false or perjurious testimony, in accordance with 19 P.S. \u00a7 640.4.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nAppellant argues that the emphasized portion of the order of August 29, 1978 grants less immunity than authorized by \u00a7 640.4 and, therefore, that the immunity order is a nullity.\nThe above order, while it does not include all of the language of \u00a7 640.4, relies solely on that statute for authority for the grant of immunity.\nThe Commonwealth, in its brief, states that it has no objection to the \u201crewording\u201d of the immunity order to track verbatim \u00a7 640.4.\nWe see no prejudice to appellant. While the August 30, 1978 immunity order does not specifically use all of the language of \u00a7 640.4, the order does rely solely on that section and we are of the opinion that the August 30, 1978 immunity order confers upon Alan Massey full immunity under the Act of November 22, 1968, supra.\nOrder of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, granting immunity to Alan Massey, is affirmed.\nPOMEROY, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nMANDERINO and LARSEN, JJ., dissent.\n. The Special Grand Jury will expire on December 22, 1978."}
