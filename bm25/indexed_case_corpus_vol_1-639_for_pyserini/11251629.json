{"id": "11251629", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThe first three assignments of error do not conform to the Rules of Court. The fourth alleges that the court below erred in not affirming the appellant\u2019s first point, which point was as follows:\n\u201c That a natural-gas company has no right in law to set off against damages for right of way, any benefits, either general or special, which may accrue to the property by reason of the presence of its line. \u201d\nThe natural-gas act of 1885, provides that if the company cannot agree with the owner as to the amount of damages, the viewers shall \u201c assess the damages proper to be paid to the property owner for the easement.\u201d Beyond this, the act fixes no measure of damages. In the case of railroads, and in some other instances where corporations are clothed with the power of eminent domain, the legislature has provided that the damages shall be determined after a fair and just comparison of the advantages and disadvantages to the property taken: See \u00a7 11, act of February 19, 1849, P. L. 84. We have therefore only the constitutional provision, that \u201c just compensation for property taken, injured or destroyed,\u201d shall be made by a corporation which takes private property for public use by virtue of its right of eminent domain. What is \u201c just compensation ?\u201d Is it anything more than the surplus of damage over the special benefits conferred? The legislature has practically said that this fills the constitutional requirement when land is taken by a railroad corporation. And if it does so in that instance, why not in the case where land is taken by a gas company ? The landowner is entitled to no more than \u201c just compensation.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed."}
