{"id": "1126419", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Chief Justice Moschzisker,\nThese two appeals, No. 232, by Addie L. Maris, widow of John M. Maris, the testator, and life tenant of his residuary estate, and No. 233, by the guardian of a minor residuary legatee, will be disposed of together. The second appellant complains because the court below held that a certain provision of the will now before us violated the act against accumulations, and the first, because the accumulations in question were'awarded to the heirs of testator under the intestate laws, instead of to the widow, who was the life beneficiary.\nMaris, after directing payment of debts and devising personal and household effects to his wife, provided as follows: \u201cAll the rest, residue and remainder of my estate......I give......unto......, in trust, to hold and invest......, and after deduction of all proper charges and expenses of the trust, to pay over the net income thereof to [the wife of testator] for and during the term of her natural life.\u201d He then provided for the division of his residuary estate into three equal parts, which, at the death of the life tenant are to be paid over to others, one of the beneficiaries to take absolutely and the remaining two shares to be held in trust for the benefit of those entitled thereto. The residuary clause of the will also provides that \u201call stock dividends consisting of shares of stock of the corporations issuing them shall be considered as principal.\u201d This last provision gave rise to the present case.\nThe executors of decedent filed an account, containing, for distribution, certain stock dividends of the kind above described; in each instance, the dividend was paid out of current earnings, which accrued after the death of John M. Maris, and in no instance did the payment decrease the intact value of the stock involved as it stood at testator\u2019s death. Under Nirdlinger\u2019s Est., 290 Pa. 457, and prior cases there cited, dividends like those here in controversy (that is, stock dividends, paid from earnings accruing subsequent to death of testator, which do not decrease the intact value of the stock as of that time) are generally classed for purposes of distribution as income, and, since the present dividends were before the court for such a purpose, they would unquestionably fall within the decisions just mentioned, were it not for the direction in testator\u2019s will that they should be considered principal; but the court below decided that the testamentary clause in question was, \u201cin effect, a direction to accumulate income contrary to the express provisions of the Act of April 16, 1853, P. L. 503,\u201d and, being such, it was inoperative. That conclusion meets with our approval, for no one can be permitted to set aside the public policy of the State by the simple expedient of designating by another name that which the courts have repeatedly decided to be income.\nIn Harkness\u2019s Est., 283 Pa. 464, 466-7, this court said it was a \u201crule of property,\u201d long established with us, that stock dividends, declared after the death of the testator, above the amount necessary to keep intact the value of the shares as they were at that date, must be distributed as income; and when a rule of property applies to a given state of fact, we have held that it controls, even though a testator, after providing for a condition to which it is applicable, may in effect provide also that the rule in question is not to control. For instance, in Lauer v. Hoffman, 241 Pa. 315, 317, 318, testator placed a provision in his will which required the application of the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case, thus creating a fee; then he added, \u201cbut in no event whatever shall the fee simple to the said real estate vest\u201d in the devisees named by him. This court said that such a provision was \u201cutterly inoperative to prevent the legal consequence\u201d of the words which, under the rule in Shelley\u2019s Case, created the fee, and that this was so no matter how plain the contrary intent might be. In the present case, the testator provided that \u201call stock dividends shall...... be considered as principal.\u201d This provision, so far as the items now in controversy are concerned, runs counter to our established rule of property that such dividends, earned after the death of the testator, which do not decrease the intact value of the stock as of that date, are income, \u2014 a rule that cannot be avoided, as presently attempted, by, under a testamentary direction, treating dividends which would otherwise be considered income as principal, if, as here, the result of that course is to impinge on the act against accumulations. This being the case, despite testator\u2019s direction that all stock dividends shall be considered as principal, those here involved remain income; and, since this income is in effect ordered to be unlawfully accumulated, it becomes presently distributable. The law was correctly so held, under somewhat similar circumstances, in Wentz\u2019s Est., 12 Pa. D. & C. 398, which seems to be the only reported Pennsylvania ruling directly approaching the precise point now before us.\nThe next question is, To whom does this distributable\" income legally belong? The court below decided that, because the direction which gave rise to the unlawful accumulation was contained in the residuary clause of the will, every provision in that part of the testament was affected, and no beneficiary there named could take the accumulated dividends. The fund in question was accordingly awarded to testator\u2019s heirs at law.\nIn making its distribution, the court below relied on the rule in White\u2019s Est., 8 Pa. Dist. R. 33, 35, enunciated as follows: \u201cAccumulation is forbidden by the act no less where it results by indirection than where it is expressly ordered [the italics are ours]; striking down of the illegal accumulation leaves the will as if it had been silent on the subject, and future gifts are not accelerated. If the accumulation relates to a vested interest, taking effect in possession, the released income goes at once to the beneficiary [of that interest; but] if [the accumulation relates] to an interest not vested in possession, the income goes to the residuary legatee or devisee, unless the residuary estate itself is the subject of the provision, in which case the income goes under the intestate laws to the next of kin, or heirs.\u201d The court also cited Edwards\u2019s Est., 190 Pa. 177; Neel\u2019s Est., 252 Pa. 394, and Billings\u2019s Est. (No. 2), 268 Pa. 71, as having influenced its decision.\nThe above quoted rule, though originally announced by the late Judge Penrose of the Philadelphia Orphans\u2019 Court, has been adopted by us in terms (see Weinman\u2019s Est., 223 Pa. 508, 510; Neel\u2019s Est., 252 Pa. 394, 409-10, 412; Thistle\u2019s Est., 263 Pa. 60, 66) ; but the court below did not properly apply it to the facts of the present case.\nOn this appeal, we are dealing solely with accumulated income earned after the death of the testator, and, deleting the provision for unlawful accumulation, his will gives all such income to the widow, during her life. Section 9 of the Act of 1853, P. L. 503, 507, provides that, where a direction for accumulation is contrary to the terms of that statute, \u201csuch direction shall be null and void in so far as it shall exceed the limits of this act and the [income] so directed to be accumulated......shall go to and be received by such person or persons as would have been entitled thereto if such accumulation had not been directed.\u201d Here, on the face of it, the widow is the person thus described; but, as previously stated, the court below thought that, because she derived her interest through the residuary clause, which part of testator\u2019s will also contains the direction for illegal accumulation, our decisions required it to distribute the accumulations now before us to testator\u2019s heirs at law. In reaching its conclusion, however, the court failed to recognize the distinction between this case and the decisions relied on by it, where, for reasons shown by our several opinions, we ruled that legatees named in the residuary clause containing the direction for illegal accumulations could not take the income there involved.\nOn the death of testator, the legal title to all of the assets in his residuary estate vested in the trustee named by him, his widow taking a vested equitable life estate. We have said that, to imply a legal estate from a devise of income, there must, ordinarily, be a gift of the gross income: Schuldt v. Reading Trust Co., 270 Pa. 360, 364; Id., 292 Pa. 327, 331-2. But where, as in the present case, property is placed in trust to pay the expenses of administration out of the income, and the net balance of income is given absolutely to a beneficiary, such beneficiary has a vested equitable interest in the principal which produces the income (Long\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 480, 485); and, under the will now before us, on the death of testator, the widow\u2019s vested interest took effect in immediate possession. Hence, the accumulation with which we have to deal \u201crelates,\u201d in the words of the guiding rule for distribution laid down in White\u2019s Est., supra, to \u201ca vested interest taking effect in possession\u201d; that is, if the present' accumulation had not been directed, the dividends involved would have belonged to the widow, \u2014 still alive and claiming, \u2014 who at the death of her husband immediately became possessed, and went into the enjoyment, of \u201ca vested interest\u201d in that part of his estate which produced the unlawfully accumulated income represented by the dividends here in question.\nOn the other hand, in all of the cases relied on by the court below, the persons laying claim to the unlawful accumulations either lacked a vested interest to which the accumulation related, or their interests had not taken immediate effect in possession, in the sense that the person claiming, or for whom the accumulations were claimed, had the enjoyment of his interest during the course of such accumulations. Thus their cases, unlike the present one, were not within the first part of the governing rule, laid down in White\u2019s Est., supra; they fell within the second part of that rule, which deals with accumulations relating to interests \u201cnot vested in possession,\u201d dictating that such income shall go to subsequent residuary legatees or devisees, unless the residuary estate itself is the subject of the provision which brought about the unlawful accumulation of the income in question and that, when it is, such income shall go to the next of kin under intestate laws.\nThis prohibition against those named in the residuary clause of a will taking released unlawful accumulations of income, and the direction, coupled therewith, that such funds shall go to the heirs at law of testator, have reference only to cases falling within the second part of the rule under consideration, which, as already pointed out, does not include the one now before us. In the present case the provision for the widow of testator is contained in the residuary clause of the will, but it gives her a vested interest to take effect in immediate possession, and the accumulations relate to that interest, therefore the case falls within the first part of the rule which the court below accepted as its guide, not within the second, and tlie accumulations go at once to the widow, who is the beneficiary, just as they would go had the will named her as beneficiary prior to, instead of in, its residuary clause.\nIn Thistle\u2019s Est., 263 Pa. 60, 64, 69, the provision for illegal accumuations was contained in the residuary clause of the will; therein,.the testator provided that, for a given time, fixed sums should be paid to his three daughters, the balance of income to accumulate and, fifteen years after his death, these accumulations to be paid, with principal, to his daughters, or, in case of the death of a daughter before the date of distribution, then to others. We said (page 65) that if the three residuary legatees could \u201cbe held to have taken, at the death of their father, such a vested interest in the corpus of the trust estate from which the income in question [was] derived, as, disregarding the implied direction for accumulation, would entitle them to such income,......then they [would have to] be awarded the whole of the...... fund\u201d; but that, since the daughters (residuary legatees) had no such vested estate in immediate possession, the award of accumulated income must be to testator\u2019s heirs at law. Before making this award, however, speaking (at pages 66-7) in connection with the Act of 1853 and the rule in White\u2019s Est., we said, as to the test of the daughters\u2019 right to the accumulations, \u201cHere, the residuary estate itself is the subject of the provision, so the controlling question......is, do the accumulations in controversy represent income accruing on a vested interest taking effect in possession; [or] in other words, have the daughters [residuary legatees] the present beneficial ownership of the principal from which the income [unlawfully accumulated] was derived?\u201d This, with its context, shows again that, had we found the daughters possessed of such an interest as just described, the award would have been to them, under the first part of the rule in White\u2019s Estate, instead of, as it was, under the second part of that rule, to testator\u2019s heirs at law.\nBefore closing, it may be well briefly to review tbe cases cited by the court below, showing that in none of them did the claimants to the unlawful accumulations meet the above stated test, and that in all of them the claimants came within the second part of the rule in White\u2019s Estate rather than the first. Moreover, in each of these cases and in others where the life tenant was refused an award of the unlawful accumulations, as, for instance, in Weinman\u2019s Est., 223 Pa. 508, the gift to the life tenant (that is, the devise or bequest itself) either directly or impliedly limited the amount of income that beneficiary should take, and thus excluded any addition thereto, \u2014 which is not so in the present case.\nIn Edwards\u2019s Est., 190 Pa. 177, the first of our cases relied on by the court below, testator, a widower, after directing payment of his debts and \u201cother proper charges,\u201d placed the \u201cclear balance\u201d of his estate in trust, to pay a fixed portion of the income therefrom to his only child, a son, for life, and, after the death of the life tenant, to pay to others (not to be ascertained till that time) the accumulations of income over that portion paid to the son during his life. An account hied during the life of the son showed accumulations which, being held unlawful, were properly awarded to the heir of testator under the intestate laws (who happened to be the son). We say \u201cwere properly awarded,\u201d for the will expressly limited the income which the son should receive as life beneficiary and no one was designated therein to take either principal or accumulated income until the time for ultimate distribution arrived. The son took as heir, not as life tenant.\nIn Neel\u2019s Est., 252 Pa. 394, also relied on by the court below, we stated (pages 411-12) that the residuary legatees claiming the fund were \u201cnot entitled to actual possession of any part of [testator\u2019s] estate until after the death of [the life tenant],\u201d and we further said (page 413) that the life tenant (who was dead) was not given an absolute right to the whole income out of which the unlawful accumulations arose. So there, again, the accumulations were properly awarded to the heirs under the intestate law.\nThe next of our cases relied on by the court below is Billings\u2019s Est. (No. 2), 268 Pa. 71, 76, where, once more, certain illegal accumulations were awarded to the heirs at law. In affirming, we particularly noted that the will contained no specific gift of income, and called attention to the fact that, thereunder, the residuary legatees were \u201cnot entitled to possession of the corpus until the expiration of a specified time and [might]......never be entitled to receive [it].\u201d\nIn White\u2019s Est., 8 Pa. Dist. R. 33 (whose leading part in the branch of the law with which we are here dealing has already been explained), the equitable life beneficiary (named prior to the residuary clause of the will) was not given the whole of the net income, but only so much thereof as the executors might deem necessary for his maintenance, the balance to accumulate till the beneficiary in question attained the age of 25 years. On the death of this life tenant, the accumulations were to go to his issue, if he left lawful issue (see White\u2019s Est., 2 Pa. Dist. R. 207, 209). This created an unlawful accumulation of income, which, it was held (page 34), belonged to the \u201cresiduary legatees,\u201d because the life beneficiary was entitled to only so much of income as he had already received and (page 35) \u201cthe contingent character of the gift to [his] issue,\u201d \u2014 \u201csuch issue as he may leave,\u201d \u2014 prevented them from taking the accumulations.\nIt may be seen from this review of the cases relied on by the court below that in none of them did the accumulations in controversy relate, as here, to a vested interest in immediate possession, or enjoyment, of a life beneficiary to whom testator had in terms given the entire net income from his residuary estate, the gift itself containing no express or implied limitation on the right to take such income, or, in other words, of a beneficiary entitled, by the terms of the will (deleting the direction for accumulations), to the whole net income of the trust fund out of which the accumulations arose. Further, it may be seen from our opinion in Thistle\u2019s Est., supra, that, had the facts in any of our prior cases, relied on by the court below, been as just outlined, the unlawful accumulations there disposed of could not have been awarded to either the heirs at law or the ultimate residuary legatees, but the award would have been under the first part of the rule in White\u2019s Estate, to the beneficiary with a vested interest in possession entitled generally to the income, albeit he or she was named in the residuary clause of the will; and that is the award which should have been made in the present case.\nIn Appeal No. 233, the decree is affirmed as far as it finds an illegal accumulation; and in No. 232, the decree is reversed so far as it awards the illegal accumulations to the heirs of testator under the intestate laws; and the accumulations in question are now awarded to testator\u2019s widow, as life beneficiary. Costs to be paid out of the estate."}
