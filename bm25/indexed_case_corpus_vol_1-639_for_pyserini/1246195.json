{"id": "1246195", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Arnold,\nPlaintiffs appeal from a decree in equity denying their prayers for relief.\nOn March 29, 1950, plaintiffs recovered two judgments in trespass actions against Bertha Miller, the first of which was begun on April 7, 1948, and the second some months thereafter.\nOn April 13, 1948, approximately one week after the commencement of one of the trespass actions, the defendant, Miller, conveyed to the defendant, Herwegh, her son, a property the record title to which had been in her since 1942.\nApproximately a month after plaintiffs recovered their judgments they filed a bill in equity alleging that no cash was paid to Bertha Miller by her son for the conveyance, and that it was made to prevent the application of the premises to the payment of her debts. The bill prayed that the deed might be declared fraudulent, and that the premises be reconveyed to her.\nAt the trial plaintiffs\u2019 only testimony was that of the defendants who were called as on cross-examination. They testified that Bertha Miller\u2019s mother died in 1920, leaving a will which provided, inter alia: \u201cI. . . leave to each of my gransons . . . $5000 cash . . . I entrust her, [defendant, Miller] ... to give the $5000 cash to each . . . when they are 21 ... \u2018Not to be put in bank or banks\u2019 \u201d; that she paid the mother of each of two other grandsons when they became 21; that she retained her son\u2019s money although he became 21 in 1939; that in 1940 she invested part of it in a property which she sold a short time later; that the instant premises were purchased at her son\u2019s direction, but that she took title in her name because Herwegh was having marital difficulties; that the cash paid for the property came from the legacy; that Herwegh lived in the premises, repaired them, etc. until he was sent to prison in September, 1943; that the conveyance to Herwegh was made when he thought his wife\u2019s decree in divorce was final; and that the ownership was never intended to be in the defendant, Miller. None of this testimony was denied, contradicted or impeached.\nThe chancellor\u2019s findings of fact were that the cash paid for the premises was part of the son\u2019s legacy; that the conveyance to the son was because he wanted the premises \u201cback in his name\u201d; that there was \u201cno evidence . . . upon which a finding of fraud in said conveyance could be predicated.\u201d The chancellor specifically stated that the findings were \u201cestablished by credible testimony\u201d; and that defendants\u2019 testimony \u201cis believed.\u201d\nAppellants contend that \u201cthe testimony of the Defendants [called as on cross-examination] must be evaluated and sifted and only that part of their testimony found to be creditable remains to become part of the Plaintiffs\u2019 case.\u201d They then point to some alleged contradictory portions of the testimony to support their contention that the defendants should not be believed in toto.\nThe argument of the appellants is one that should be directed only to the chancellor: Fishel v. McDonald, 376 Pa. 281, 101 A. 2d 674. Actually the contention is that this Court should substitute its findings for the findings of the court below, which, of course, cannot be done. The chancellor believed the defendants and found that no fraud had been committed. His findings were supported by the evidence, and, when affirmed by the court en banc, have the effect of a jury\u2019s verdict, binding on us: Fishel v. McDonald, supra.\nPlaintiffs further contend that the conveyance can be sustained only on the theory of a resulting trust, and since it was not made within five years after the trust accrued, the same could not be enforced (Act of 1856, P. L. 532, 12 PS \u00a783). The Act provides: \u201cNo . . . action [shall] be maintained ... to enforce, any implied or resulting trust as to realty, but within five years after such . . . trust accrued . . .\u201d (Italics supplied). There are three answers to this contention: First, as stated in Faunce v. McCorkle, 321 Pa. 116, 119, 183 A. 926: \u201cThe statute protects the holder of the legal title but he may waive its provisions. \u2018The Statute of Frauds does not prevent a trustee from honestly carrying out his parol agreements, it merely avoids the trust at his option\u2019 . . . \u2018Where an oral trust of an interest in land is created inter vivos, the trustee can properly perform the trust if he has not transferred the interest, although he cannot be compelled to do so\u2019: Restatement, section 43, page 134.\u201d The only purpose of the Act is \u201cto protect the holder of the title\u201d and he may waive the benefit of the statute: Williams v. Moodhard, 341 Pa. 273, 280, 19 A. 2d 101. Second, the Act provides only that \u201cno . . . action\u201d may be brought \u201cto enforce\u201d the trust; but no action was brought by Herwegh for such purpose. Third, defendant-son was in possession until the fall of 1943 and the conveyance was made before the passing of five years from that time. This prevented the limitation from running against him and also refutes the charge of laches: Wosches v. Kraning, 353 Pa. 481, 485, 46 A. 2d 220.\nDecree affirmed at the cost of the plaintiffs."}
