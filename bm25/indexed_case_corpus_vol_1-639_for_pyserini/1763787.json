{"id": "1763787", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nAppellant, Clarence Miller, was convicted of murder of the first degree after a jury trial in Allegheny County and sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. This is a direct appeal from the judgment of sentence.\nReading the record in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, it discloses the following:\nThe victim, George Wilhelm, first met Miller in 1974. Miller and two associates, Orlosky and Goldblum, developed an elaborate scheme to defraud Wilhelm under the pretense of acquiring government land for him. In all, Wilhelm was defrauded of over twenty-one thousand dollars ($21,000.00). Wilhelm contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation when he discovered the fraud, but Miller and Goldblum persuaded him to disclaim the complaint. Subsequently, Goldblum decided to set fire to a restaurant he owned in order to collect the insurance money so that he could satisfy a federal income tax debt. He offered Wilhelm three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) to commit the arson. Wilhelm set the fire but never received the full amount promised. Later, Goldblum expressed concern to Miller regarding Wilhelm\u2019s demands for payment and threats to inform law enforcement authorities of the arson.\nMiller and Goldblum met in Pittsburgh on February 8, 1976 and agreed to silence Wilhelm by stabbing him. Miller agreed to lure Wilhelm to the site of the stabbing for a sum of fifty dollars ($50.00). On February 9,1976, the three men met in downtown Pittsburgh. Goldblum told Wilhelm he had his money and requested Wilhelm to drive him and Miller to the roof level of a parking garage or, ostensibly, to Goldblum\u2019s automobile. When Wilhelm stopped his vehicle in the garage, Goldblum hit him over the head with a wrench causing him to slump out of the car. Goldblum began stabbing Wilhelm with a blade of a grass shear. The stabbing continued as Wilhelm, trying to recover, crawled around the floor of the garage. When he managed to pull himself up against the side wall, Goldblum struck him, and Wilhelm fell over the wall to the roof of a walkway to an adjoining building. Miller and Goldblum fled the scene. Wilhelm was discovered lying on the roof crying for help and died shortly thereafter from internal bleeding caused by the multiple stab wounds. Before death, Wilhelm told the police: \u201cClarence Miller did this to me.\u201d\nDuring the police investigation that followed, Miller was taken into custody, and he implicated Goldblum. Thereafter, he cooperated with the police and testified as a Commonwealth witness at Goldblum\u2019s trial. Goldblum was convicted of murder of the first degree.\nPrior to his own trial, Miller filed a motion to dismiss the charges against him. He alleged his cooperation with the police and his testimony at Goldblum\u2019s trial were induced by actions and statements on the part of the police and the district attorney\u2019s office which gave Miller and his trial counsel the impression that the prosecuting authorities had concluded Miller was not criminally responsible for the stabbing of Wilhelm, and this \u201cimpression\u201d caused trial counsel to render less than effective assistance to Miller\u2019s prejudice and, thereby, denied him due process. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss. This ruling is the first assignment of error.\nThe relevant facts follow:\nMiller was taken into police custody on March 10, 1976. On that day, he made two statements to the police. The first was exculpatory, but, in the second, he stated Goldblum stabbed Wilhelm and he helped lure Wilhelm to the site fully aware of Goldblum\u2019s intentions.\nThereafter, Miller was hospitalized and visited by an attorney friend, Vincent C. Murovich, Esquire, who eventually became Miller\u2019s trial counsel. During the hospital visit, Miller told Murovich, Goldblum was guilty of the attack on Wilhelm and he, himself, was innocent of any wrongdoing. He did not tell the attorney that he had made two statements to the police and/or that he had told the police that he had helped lure Wilhelm to the scene of the attack knowing Goldblum planned to stab him. After hearing Miller assert Goldblum was alone involved in the stabbing, Murovich agreed to be Miller\u2019s counsel if Miller took a lie detector test and it established his innocence.\nThe lie detector test was administered, and police officer Amity told Murovich, Miller \u201cflunked it.\u201d Murovich asked another officer, Condemni: \u201cIs he telling the truth? Did this really happen?\u201d Condemni responded: \u201cNo, he passed it, but it was shaky in some areas.\u201d Murovich did not inquire what questions were asked nor did he seek to know what areas were shaky. The police officers did not inform Murovich of Miller\u2019s self-incriminations when he was first arrested nor the specific results of the lie detector test, and Murovich first learned of Miller\u2019s inculpatory statements to the police shortly before or during the Goldblum trial.\nAfter the lie detector test was concluded and upon receiving the word that Miller had passed the test, under the circumstances outlined before, Murovich advised Miller to cooperate fully with the police.\nThereafter, Miller testified as a Commonwealth witness at the coroner\u2019s inquest at which both he and Goldblum were held for court on the murder charge. During his testimony at the inquest at the instance of an assistant district attorney, Miller refrained from giving any testimony concerning the motive for the Wilhelm attack.\nMiller subsequently gave the police a third statement in which he said he helped lure Wilhelm to the garage so Goldblum could \u201cbeat him.\u201d After this statement, Miller was given another lie detector test focusing on his statement as to why Wilhelm was lured to the garage. After this test, Murovich was allegedly led to believe by an officer Freeman that Miller passed the test.\nSpecifically, Freeman told Murovich \u201che was 100 percent sure that [Miller] did not stab Wilhelm.\u201d Murovich was aware of Officer Freeman\u2019s attempts to obtain bail for Miller in order for him to aid in the investigation. Miller gained bail and was again advised by Murovich to cooperate fully with the police.\nFollowing the foregoing events and as the date for Goldblum\u2019s trial approached, Murovich, Miller, and assistant district attorney Dixon met and conferred on Miller\u2019s testimony at the trial. After about 15 minutes of discussion, Murovich prepared to leave saying: \u201cYou two seem to be getting along real well\u201d and inquired: \u201cDo you think you will be needing me?\u201d Dixon replied: \u201cNo, not really, we\u2019ll be able to handle it with no problem.\u201d\nBased on the foregoing, Miller contends he and his trial counsel reasonably believed the police and the district attorney\u2019s office \u201ctook the position that appellant did not have advance knowledge or intention to kill the victim and that he did not aid in the killing of the victim\u201d and, acting on this belief and with the permission of his counsel, \u201che gave the Commonwealth evidence which it later turned against him.\u201d\nThe problem with Miller\u2019s claim is that none of the alleged assurances or representations occurred as part of ongoing plea-bargain negotiations, nor was immunity from prosecution offered. Cf. Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 92 S.Ct. 495, 30 L.Ed.2d 427 (1971) (plea bargain); Cooper v. United States, 594 F.2d 12 (4th Cir. 1979) (plea bargain); Commonwealth v. Zakrzewski, 460 Pa. 528, 333 A.2d 898 (1975) (plea bargain); Commonwealth v. Peters, 473 Pa. 72, 373 A.2d 1055 (1977) (promise of immunity). Assuming arguendo the representations were made as asserted by Miller and his counsel, there was nothing binding about them; rather, they expressed what were essentially the opinions of the speakers that, at most, they believed, at certain points in time, Miller was innocent.* Furthermore, in addition to the absence of any formal immunity offer, none of the representations even indicated Miller would not be prosecuted. Given the absence of representations made in a context of ongoing plea negotiations or a formal immunity offer and given the absence of any representations that Miller would not be prosecuted, counsel\u2019s representation cannot be said to have been rendered ineffective because of the representations here made. As stated, at most, the opinions of the speakers indicated a belief in Miller\u2019s innocence at certain points in time during the investigation, but, whether Miller and counsel misapprehended the Commonwealth\u2019s opinion about Miller\u2019s culpability or whether the Commonwealth changed its opinion of his culpability, those opinions under the circumstances presented could not have reasonably misled counsel into the course of action he took even assuming such might be determined ineffective representation, an issue we do not reach. Accordingly, Miller was not denied due process for the reason advanced.\nIn this connection, Miller further alleges the Commonwealth, having advanced the theory during the Goldblum trial that Goldblum was the sole assailant and Miller was an onlooker, was estopped from prosecuting Miller. The Commonwealth advanced no theory and presented no evidence during the Goldblum trial which would necessarily preclude Miller\u2019s culpability. As noted before, the jury was charged it could find Goldblum guilty of murder of the first degree as a principal or as an accomplice of Miller.\nMiller claims the trial court took insufficient measures to shield the jury from prejudicial publicity and erred in failing to declare a mistrial after the prosecuting attorney violated a court order barring communication with the press. While no court order appears of record, the Commonwealth concedes such an order was entered sometime prior to the Miller trial and further concedes the assistant district attorney did communicate with the press in violation of that order. The controversy revolves around a news article which appeared on the second page of the Pittsburgh Press on the evening of June 1, 1978, some eight days after the trial began. The article contained an account of that day\u2019s trial activities and included information that an inculpatory statement by Miller would not be admitted at trial by agreement of counsel because \u201cit was taken after Miller had taken a lie detector test.\u201d The incriminating contents of the statement were reported, as well as an explanation the statement would be kept out of the trial \u201cto avoid a legal issue.\u201d While the assistant district attorney arguably violated our directive in Commonwealth v. Pierce, 451 Pa. 190, 303 A.2d 209 (1973), regarding release of information to the news media by members of staffs of District Attorneys\u2019 offices, and concededly violated a protective court order, this standing alone does not require the grant of a new trial or other relief. See Commonwealth v. Nahodil, 462 Pa. 301, 341 A.2d 91 (1975). When there is a possibility highly prejudicial materials may reach a jury, the trial court is charged with responsibility to take appropriate protective action to ensure no prejudice will occur. The circumstances of each case determine what precautions are necessary. Commonwealth v. Bruno, 466 Pa. 245, 352 A.2d 40 (1976). In Bruno, in the face of extensive, inflammatory publicity, including information concerning a suppressed confession, the trial court did not specifically instruct the jury to refrain from looking at newspapers or listening to television and radio reports. The jury was warned but one time to report to the court any incident which might affect their judgment, and, despite repeated requests by defense counsel, the court totally refused to voir dire the jurors concerning possible exposure to prejudicial materials.\nInstantly, we are concerned with the impact of one news article published during the course of the trial, not continued and pervasive inflammatory publicity. The article was located on page two of the newspaper where it could not be seen as the result of a casual glance. The article did contain the substance of a damaging admission by Miller which, while it had not been suppressed, had been excluded from the trial by agreement of Miller\u2019s counsel and the district attorney. While exposure of the jury to this material could have prejudiced fair consideration of the evidence before the jury, it is important to note the jury had already been exposed to the admission during the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement. At the time counsel agreed to exclude the statement from the trial, the jury was given a cautionary instruction not to consider the statement. Under these circumstances, we conclude the trial court took sufficient precautions to protect the integrity of the trial.\nOn May 24, 1978, after the jury was selected, but before they were sworn, the court instructed the panel not to read newspaper reports connected with the case, not to listen to television, nor discuss the case with anyone. On May 25, 1978, after the jury was sworn, they were again warned not to discuss the case with anyone, even family members, not to read newspapers or other reports about the case or the defendant, and to avoid radio or television broadcasts which might refer to the case; the court stated: \u201cYour only information about this case should come to you while you are present together, acting as a jury, in the presence of the Court and the attorneys and the defendant.\u201d Again, on May 26, 1978, the Friday before a long weekend, the court directed the jury:\n\u201cMembers of the Jury, we have a long weekend coming up, all of you have a good time, but I want to admonish you again, don\u2019t let anybody talk to you about the case and don\u2019t read anything or listen to anything on television. ...\u201d\nOn June 2, 1978, defense counsel brought to the attention of the court the newspaper article under discussion. After refusing a defense motion for a mistrial, the court conducted individual voir dire of each juror and alternate, with a court reporter present, and asked the following questions:\n\u201cDid you read the article in the Pittsburgh Press last night about this case?\u201d\n\u201cHas anyone talked to you about the article that appeared in the Pittsburgh Press last night?\u201d\nEach juror and alternate responded in the negative to both questions, and the court was satisfied with the jurors\u2019 sincerity. At the end of the day, a Friday, the court refused a defense motion for sequestration of the jury and instead issued an additional caution to the jury:\n\u201cMembers of the Jury, I want to admonish you not to read newspapers or listen to the radio or television or read newspapers [sic] and I would also like to admonish you not to talk to anybody about this case and don\u2019t let anybody talk to you.\nOn the next day of trial, the court refused defense counsel\u2019s motion for a repetition of the previous Friday\u2019s voir dire. In view of the prior exposure of the jury to Miller\u2019s statement, the minimal amount of publicity involved, the issuance of repeated warnings to the jury to avoid media reports about the trial and defendant, the jury\u2019s negative responses to individual voir dire, and the court\u2019s express judgment that the jurors were sincere and honest, we conclude the court satisfactorily shielded the trial from prejudicial publicity.\nMiller asserts the admission into evidence of nine photographs illustrating the victim\u2019s wounds was reversible error. Although a photograph is generally admissible if it meets the criteria of relevancy and competency, we have developed a more demanding standard for photographs of corpses in homicide cases \u201cto protect an accused from a conviction based upon a jury\u2019s emotional reaction, rather than a careful deliberation of the facts of the case.\u201d Commonwealth v. Batty, 482 Pa. 173, 177, 393 A.2d 435, 437 (1978). A two-stepped analysis is required. First, the court must decide whether a photograph is inflammatory in nature. \u201cIf, but only if, the photograph is deemed to be inflammatory, the Court must then apply the balancing test . i. e., is the photograph of \u2018such essential evidentiary value that [its] need clearly outweighs the likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jurors\u2019 \u201d [Citations omitted.] [Emphasis in original.] Batty, supra, 482 Pa. at 177, 393 A.2d at 437. Instantly, the court determined the photographs were relevant and not inflammatory.\nWe have previously stated a photograph of a corpse is not inflammatory per se. Commonwealth v. Petrakovich, 459 Pa. 511, 329 A.2d 844 (1974). Rather, it is generally the manner in which a corpse is displayed which renders a photograph emotionally charged. The challenged photographs are black and white. They show portions of the victim\u2019s body with stab wounds, the majority of which are stitched closed. None shows a full view of the corpse, and only one depicts a small portion of the victim\u2019s face. The body has been cleared of blood and this makes the photographs appear overall quite clinical. Compare Commonwealth v. Rogers, 485 Pa. 132, 401 A.2d 329 (1979) (depiction in close and graphic detail of victim\u2019s distorted face, head wounds and blood, and flesh and brains scattered in snow around head); Commonwealth v. Chacko, 480 Pa. 504, 391 A.2d 999 (1978) (victim\u2019s body clothed in undergarments, body and clothing splattered with blood, and large, gaping wound in neck). Thus, admission of the photographs into evidence was not error.\nMiller claims he is entitled to a new trial because a police officer testifying for the Commonwealth was permitted to give evidence regarding Miller\u2019s exercise of his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent and, thus, raised a prejudicial inference of guilt. See Commonwealth v. Haideman, 449 Pa. 367, 296 A.2d 765 (1972); Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 246 Pa.Super. 132, 369 A.2d 846 (1977). On the day of his arrest, Miller gave two statements to the police. After he finished the second statement, he was asked if he would tape it. Soon thereafter, he fainted. He did make the tape at a later date. It is the mention of his fainting which is now claimed to be prejudicial error. We cannot accept the proposition that fainting is an exercise of the Fifth Amendment right to stand mute in the face of accusation.\nMiller next asserts he was deprived of a fair trial when, on direct examination, a police officer referred to giving Miller a lie detector test. In Commonwealth v. Johnson, 441 Pa. 237, 272 A.2d 467 (1971), this Court held a reference to a lie detector test or its results which raises inferences regarding the guilt or innocence of a defendant is impermissible. Instantly the error allegedly resulted from the following exchange:\n\u201cQ. Mr. Miller was arraigned on February 11, 1976, that would have been a Wednesday. Did you participate in that?\nA. Yes, Sir.\nQ. Now, was there any questioning done in that procedure?\nA. Not really. We were trying to make arrangements with his attorney to take a test.\u201d\nThis testimony did not identify the test, did not indicate whether it was ever arranged, and did not reveal any results. Miller\u2019s claim this testimony raised an impermissible inference of his guilt is without merit.\nMiller asserts the court should not have permitted evidence of the victim\u2019s dying declaration, \u201cClarence, Clarence Miller did this to me,\u201d because the victim\u2019s condition made him unable to distinguish between his observations and surmise. It is true that to be admissible, a dying declaration must be based on observations of the declarant and may not merely be an expression of opinion based on reflection or reasoning. Commonwealth v. Perry, 364 Pa. 537, 73 A.2d 425 (1950). There was nothing in the circumstances of the instant dying declaration to lead to the conclusion it was an expression of opinion after reflection, rather than a first-hand observation. Rather, the victim had just suffered serious wounds inflicted personally by an assailant or assailants. In all other respects, the statement met the requirements for admission of a dying declaration, i. e., at the time of the declaration, the declarant believed he would die, death was imminent, and death actually ensued. See Commonwealth v. Brown, 388 Pa. 613, 131 A.2d 367 (1957). The victim stated twice to police officers he knew he was going to die, and he did die shortly thereafter. Miller further argues the court was bound to instruct the jury to receive the evidence of a dying declaration with great caution. However, once the trial court has decided the declaration is admissible, a general charge to the jury on credibility of witnesses and weight of evidence, as was given in this case, is sufficient. Commonwealth v. Edwards, 431 Pa. 44, 244 A.2d 683 (1978).\nMiller challenges the admission of allegedly inflammatory testimony by the victim\u2019s mother regarding the victim\u2019s physical incapacity following a work-related accident. The testimony was offered in rebuttal after defense testimony attempted to discredit the honesty of the victim by implying his claim of injury was merely a pretense used to receive a financial settlement. The admission or rejection of rebuttal evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge. Commonwealth v. Farrior, 446 Pa. 31, 284 A.2d 684 (1971). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the challenged rebuttal evidence after finding it was not inflammatory.\nMiller finally claims his two February 10, 1976 statements to police should have been suppressed because they were the fruits of an illegal arrest, i. e. a warrantless arrest in his home absent exigent circumstances and thus violative of our decision in Commonwealth v. Williams, 483 Pa. 293, 396 A.2d 1177 (1978). However, Miller\u2019s arrest occurred over two years before our holding in Williams, and we decline to accord the Williams decision retroactive effect.\n\u201c \u2018[T]he Constitution neither prohibits nor requires retrospective effect\u2019 for decisions expounding new constitutional rules affecting criminal trials.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Desist v. United States, 394 U.S. 244, 248-49, 89 S.Ct. 1030, 1033, 22 L.Ed.2d 248 (1969) (plurality opinion). In Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967), a majority of the United States Supreme Court agreed on the factors which should inform a decision regarding retroactivity:\n\u201cThe criteria guiding resolution of the question implicate (a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (c) the effect on the administration of justice.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)\nId., at 297, 87 S.Ct. at 1970. The purpose to be served by the new rule should receive primary consideration. \u201cWhere the major purpose of new constitutional doctrine is to overcome an aspect of the criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth-finding function and so raises serious questions about the accuracy of guilty verdicts in past trials, the new rule has been given complete retroactive effect.\u201d Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 653, 91 S.Ct. 1148, 1152, 28 L.Ed.2d 388 (1971) (plurality opinion). Conversely, the same standard \u201cstrongly supports prospectivity for a decision amplifying the evidentiary exclusionary rule,\u201d Desist, supra 394 U.S. at 249, 89 S.Ct. at 1033, the primary purpose of which is to deter unlawful police conduct.\nThe remaining considerations, reliance of law enforcement authorities and burden on the administration of justice, also militate against retroactive application of our holding in Williams. Undoubtedly, Commonwealth law enforcement authorities justifiably relied upon prior practice which required no warrant to arrest a suspect in his or her home. We may take judicial notice of the adverse impact on the administration of justice in Pennsylvania which would result from requiring exclusion of the fruits of arrests legal at the time they were made. Because our holding in Williams does not implicate the truth-determining process and because the governing criteria all run in favor of prospective application, we hold the Williams rule applies only to arrests made subsequent to the date of the decision, November 18, 1978. See also Commonwealth v. Cain, 471 Pa. 140, 369 A.2d 1234 (1977) (opinion in support of affirmance; Eagen, J.); Commonwealth v. Myles, 471 Pa. 616, 370 A.2d 1193 (1977) (opinion in support of affirmance; Nix, J.).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nLARSEN, J., did not participate in the decision in this case.\n. In addition to Attorney Murovich, Miller was also represented at various stages of these proceedings by another attorney who learned of the two statements, as well as a third mentioned infra, prior to Goldblum\u2019s trial, but apparently failed to convey that information to Attorney Murovich until the Goldblum trial commenced or immediately before it commenced. For the purposes of this appeal, we accept the fact that Attorney Murovich was Miller\u2019s only counsel at trial.\n. A clergyman, Reverend Naumann, whom Freeman contacted to assist Miller in obtaining bail, testified that Freeman told him he believed Miller was innocent. Freeman testified that he represented only that Miller did not stab Wilhelm.\na. It is also urged that the opening statement of the assistant district attorney at the Goldblum trial also led Miller\u2019s counsel to believe the Commonwealth had concluded Miller did not have knowledge of Goldblum\u2019s intention to stab or kill Wilhelm when he joined Goldblum in luring Wilhelm to the garage. However, the record shows that, during the Goldblum trial, the evidence included Miller\u2019s statement to the police admitting he had prior knowledge of Goldblum\u2019s intentions to stab Wilhelm. Additionally, at the Goldblum trial, the jury was instructed it could find Goldblum was an accomplice of Miller in the homicide. Under the circumstances, it is difficult to understand how the Goldblum trial could have given Miller\u2019s counsel assurance that the Commonwealth believed Miller was free of responsibility in the killing.\n. In a related claim, Miller challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his conviction. The alleged inconsistent Commonwealth theories are claimed to preclude a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Since we have found nothing inherently inconsistent in the theories advanced by the Commonwealth, this claim must fail. An independent review of the record reveals sufficient evidence to sustain Miller\u2019s conviction of murder of the first degree.\n. While most of the information in the article could have been collected during the course of the hearing on pre-trial motions, the report of the reason why the statement would not be admitted at trial is attributable to the prosecuting attorney. The statement contained an admission by Miller that he had held the victim during the stabbing.\n. The cautionary instruction was as follows:\n\u201cI want to call something to your attention. [The Assistant District Attorney] in his opening statement, made reference to a statement given by the defendant to Detective Stottlemyer, and because of certain reasons, which you have no concern with, that statement by agreement of counsel will be withdrawn from the case, from your consideration.\u201d\n. Both counsel and the defendant himself agreed to this procedure.\n. The decision whether to sequester a jury in the interests of justice is committed to the discretion of the trial court. Pa.R.Crim.P. 1111(a). See also Pa.R.Crim.P. 326.\n. We note the trial co.urt substantially followed the procedures prescribed in the A.B.A. Standards Relating to the Administration of Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Fair Trial and Free Press, \u00a7 3.6(e)(f) (App. Draft 1978). Our disposition of this issue in no way reflects approval of contact with the press by a member of a District Attorney\u2019s Office under protective court order not to so communicate.\n. The Commonwealth contends this claim is waived for failure of defense counsel to object specifically to the jury instructions before the jury retired to deliberate. However, defense counsel did submit a point for charge to the court which was rejected. See Common wealth v. Young, 474 Pa. 96, 376 A.2d 990 (1977); Commonwealth v. Williams, 463 Pa. 370, 373 n. 1, 344 A.2d 877, 879 n. 1 (1975).\n. Cf. Commonwealth v. Fugmann, 330 Pa. 4, 198 A. 99 (1938) (Before dying of wounds caused by bomb received in the mail, declarant stated, \u201cFugmann done this.\u201d Since declarant had no personal knowledge of who sent the bomb, admission of declaration was error.)\n. The question of retroactivity of Williams requires us to look to federal constitutional standards, as well as evaluating the problem in terms of our supervisory powers, because we based our holding in Williams on the Fourth Amendment.\n. Preservation of judicial integrity is an additional object of the exclusionary rule. Reception into evidence of the fruits of arrests legal at the time they were made does not violate this imperative.\n. If Williams were to apply to arrests made before the date of the decision, we would be faced with the further problem of whether to grant relief to those collaterally attacking their convictions. See Commonwealth v. Heard, 451 Pa. 125, 301 A.2d 870 (1973) (dissenting opinion; Pomeroy, J.).\n. Miller does not assert he was otherwise unlawfully arrested. There was probable cause sufficient to justify his arrest, the fruits of which are admissible against him."}
