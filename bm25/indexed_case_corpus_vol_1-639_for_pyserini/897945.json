{"id": "897945", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nA careful consideration of the testimony in this case has satisfied us that it is insufficient to have justified the submission to a jury of the question of defendant\u2019s liability for the unfortunate accident that resulted in the death of plaintiff\u2019s husband. It therefore follows that there was no error in refusing to take off the judgment of nonsuit ordered by the learned trial judge.\nJudgment affirmed."}
