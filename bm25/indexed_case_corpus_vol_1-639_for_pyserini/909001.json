{"id": "909001", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nThis is another appeal in the matter of the assigned estate of L. H. Taylor & Company, brokers, which was considered in Howard\u2019s Appeal, ante, p. 304. The law was sufficiently discussed in that case.\nAt the time of the assignment Taylor & Company held certain shares of stock which had been bought on appellant\u2019s order, partly paid for by him, but not yet delivered. They were not forthcoming on demand but were credited on his account, and he presented a claim for the balance that appeared to be due him.\n. The auditor found that \u201c as far as Taylor & Company were concerned the transactions were not fictitious, but were actual purchases and sales of stock.\u201d He however found \u201c from the number and character of the transactions, that this claimant merely intended to gamble upon tbe rise and fall of the market.\u201d And on the argument of exceptions, the claimant having testified that he bought the stocks as an investment, the auditor said: \u201c The claimant\u2019s testimony as to what he intended to do, however, is strangely at variance with the admitted facts. From October 17, 1895, to the time of the failure, he bought and sold seven or eight lots of stock. His sales would often follow two or three days after his purchases. I am at liberty, under the decisions, to go beneath the surface and find the real character of the transactions, and it is a stretch of language to say that a man who buys stocks and habitually sells the same a day or so thereafter is purchasing for investment.\u201d He therefore disallowed the claim. These two extracts from his report show that the learned auditor proceeded on the popular and not on the legal view of dealing in stocks, and entirely failed to apply the settled legal distinction between \u201c gambling \u201d and legitimate dealing. A man may speculate by buying and selling upon expectation of the rise or fall of the market and he is not thereby gambling. Whether he dealt for that purpose or for investment, and whether he held his purchases an hour, or a day, or a year, are wholly immaterial except as evidence. The test is whether he bought and sold, and not merely settled on differences with no intention at any time of taking his purchases or delivering his sales. That and that only is gambling. As already said, the auditor found that as to Taylor & Company the transactions were actual purchases and sales. The appellant testified that as to himself they had the same character, and this testimony was corroborated and in no way contradicted except by the auditor\u2019s inference \u201c from the number and character of the transactions.\u201d This conclusion was not warranted by anything in the evidence.\nThe judgment so far as it relates to this appellant\u2019s claim is reversed and the claim directed to be allowed."}
