{"id": "1947054", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Roberts,\nAt 6:00 a.m., on April 15, 1969, Officer Uziel of the Borough of Glassport Police Department, droye up to the Borough Police Station. Appellant, Darrell Dzvonick, immediately came out of the station toward Officer Uziel\u2019s car with a knife held at arm\u2019s length. He lunged at the officer with the knife through the open car window, but did not \u201ccut, stab, or wound\u201d the officer. Appellant was immediately arrested and subsequently charged with both attempt with intent to kill and assault with intent to maim. He pleaded not guilty to both charges and was tried before a jury.\nOn September 29, 1969, the jury returned verdicts of not guilty of attempt with intent to kill and guilty on the second charge of assault with intent to maim. Appellant filed no post-trial motions. However, after a change of counsel, and appeal to the Superior Court, he was permitted to file motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment \u201cnunc pro tunc\u201d. The motion for a new trial was later withdrawn, and the motion in arrest of judgment was denied.\nAppellant appealed the denial of his motion in arrest of judgment to the Superior Court which affirmed by a per curiam order. We granted allocatur.\nAppellant cites three principal errors as the basis for relief on this appeal. He asserts that the verdict of guilty of assault with intent to maim as returned by the jury and recorded by the court is unsupported by the evidence and therefore his motion in arrest of judgment should have been granted. The Commonwealth concedes that the jury\u2019s verdict was not supported by the evidence, but nevertheless claims that the court molded the jury\u2019s verdict to that of guilty of attempted assault with intent to maim. In response appellant asserts that the court did not mold the verdict to guilty of the attempt offense, nor could it have done so after-discharging the jury. Finally appellant contends, arguendo, that even if the verdict was so molded it could not stand because there is no such offense as \u201cattempted assault with intent to maim.\u201d In view of our disposition of the case we need not deal with the last challenge.\nThe Commonwealth claims that after the jury returned a verdict of guilty of assault with intent to maim (the completed offense), the court molded the verdict to guilty of attempted assault with intent to maiin. However, the Commonwealth\u2019s claim of such molding is nowhere supported in the record. The following excerpt from the record establishes that the only \u201cmolding\u201d which occurred was the court\u2019s insertion of the date, which the jury had inadvertently omitted. \u201cMinute Clerk: Who will read the verdict? The Foreman: I will. The jury finds the defendant guilty on the second count. The Court: All right. You find him not guilty on the first count? Is that correct? (Jury indicates affirmative.) The Court: We will record the verdict. Minute Clerk : Members of the jury, Harken to your verdict as the Court hath recorded it between the Commonwealth and the defendant Darrell Dzvonick, wherein the defendant is charged of the first count, attempt with intent to kill, and the second count, assault with intent to maim, you say you find the defendant not guilty of the first count and guilty as to the second count. I might mention to the Court the jury left out the date. The Court: All right. Well, we\u2019ll mold the verdict; but including today\u2019s date, there\u2019s no objection by counsel? Mr. Mansmann : No. The Court: We will make it September 29, 1969. (Jurors Excused)\u201d\nThe record discloses no other molding of the verdict whatsoever by the trial judge, either before or after the jury was excused. Moreover, once the jury has been discharged and has dispersed, the verdict can no longer be molded by the trial judge. Commonwealth v. Martin, 379 Pa. 587, 109 A. 2d 325 (1954); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 359 Pa. 287, 59 A. 2d 128 (1948); cf. Commonwealth v. Corbin, 215 Pa. Superior Ct. 63, 257 A. 2d 356 (1969).\nTlie guilty verdict returned by the jury and recorded by the court was not, and could not in the circumstances be molded. Thus, appellant stands convicted of the completed offense\u2014assault with intent to maim. Since both the Commonwealth and appellant readily concede that the \u201cassault\u201d verdict is not supported by the evidence, it necessarily follows that the verdict may not stand.\nAccordingly, the order of the Superior Court is reversed and the motion in arrest of judgment is granted.\nMr. Justice Eagen concurs in the result.\nAct of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, \u00a7711, 18 P.S. \u00a74711.\nAct of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, \u00a7712, 18 P.S. \u00a74712.\n\u201cWhoever . . . stabs, cuts or wounds any person, with intent to maim, disfigure or disable such person, is guilty of felony. . . .\u201d Act of .Tune 2-1, 1939, P. L. 872, \u00a7712, 18 P.S. \u00a74712. At trial Officer Uziel testified that although he might have been touched with the knife he definitely was not cut, wounded or stabbed in any way. Thus there was no evidence to support the charge of the completed offense.\nThe situations in which molding is permissible are severely circumscribed. They fall into two principal categories\u2014molding prior to recording the verdict and discharge of the jury, and molding after such recording and discharge.\nPrior to recording the verdict there are two accepted methods of verdict molding. See Laub, Pennsylvania Trial Guide, \u00a7244, at 416 (1959). If the jury\u2019s error is defective in form only, as here where the date was omitted, then the judge may correct it in open court with the acquiescence of the jury. Commonvwealth v. Minoff, 363 Pa. 287, 69 A. 2d 145 (1949) ; see also Newsom v. Smyth, 261 E. 2d 452 (4th Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 359 U.S. 969, 79 S. Ct. 883 (1959). However, if the error is substantive, the court must send the jury back with additional instructions for further deliberation. Commonwealth v. Komatowski, 347 Pa. 445, 32 A. 2d 905 (1943), citing Commonwealth v. Huston, 46 Pa. Superior Ct. 172 (1911) ; Commonwealth v. Micuso, 273 Pa. 474, 117 Atl. 211 (1922) ; see also United States v. Henson, 365 F. 2d 282 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 385 U.S. 974, 87 S. Ct. 513 (1966) ; Helms v. United States, 310 F. 2d 236 (5th Cir. 1962) ; cf. Glenn v. United States, 420 P. 2d 1323 (D.C. Cir. 1969).\nAfter the verdict has been recorded and the jury discharged, only in \u201cextremely exceptional cases\u201d may the verdict be molded and even then \u201conly unless to make the corrected verdict conform to the obvious intention of the jury, i.e., to conform to a verdict actually rendered, but informally or improperly stated in writing.\u201d Laub, supra, at 415. After the jury has been discharged the verdict as recorded may not be molded by the trial court. See Commonwealth v. Martin, 379 Pa. 587, 109 A. 2d 325 (1954).\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s theory that the court molded the verdict is an assumption that is directly contradicted by the record. Even had molding occurred it would not have constituted a permissible molding of the jury verdict; it would instead be a substitution of an entirely new verdict never found by the jury for the verdict it did in fact return."}
