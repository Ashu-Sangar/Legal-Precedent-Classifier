{"id": "473127", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis is an action of trespass for damages for personal injuries alleged to have been caused by negligence of defendants. The jury returned a verdict against both defendants for $7,000. We can find no merit in this appeal of the original defendant. The additional defendant did hot appeal. It was necessary to submit the case to the jury. Even defendant\u2019s own testimony suggests his negligence. The judgment is affirmed on the opinion of the learned President Judge of the court below."}
