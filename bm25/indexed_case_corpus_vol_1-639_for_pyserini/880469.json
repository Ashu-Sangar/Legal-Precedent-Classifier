{"id": "880469", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe find nothing in this record to justify a reversal of the judgment. The case appears to have been tried with marked ability and fairness. Plaintiff\u2019s right to recover depended on questions of fact which were clearly for the consideration of the jury; and they were accordingly submitted to them by the learned trial judge with full, clear and- accurate instructions. Beyond that he had no right to go. If he had complied with defendant\u2019s fourth request for instructions, and charged that, \u201c under all the evidence in the case the verdict must be for the defendant,\u201d it would have been manifest error. As we had occasion to say in Railroad v. Werner, 89 Pa. 59 (a case in some of its features not unlike the one under consideration), u When the facts are admitted or so clearly and conclusively proved as to admit of no reasonable doubt, it is the duty of the \u2022court to declare the law applicable to them; but, when material facts are disputed or inferences of fact are to be drawn from the testimony, it is the exclusive province of the jury to determine what they are. The line of demarcation, in that respect, between the duty of the court and that of the jury should be \u25a0carefully guarded. While, on the one hand, the court should never permit the jury to disregard or evade its instructions as to matters of law, it should be equally careful not to invade the province of the jury and take upon itself the determination \u25a0of facts about which there is any dispute.\u201d In this case, the learned trial judge acted strictly within the lines of his duty.\nWe find nothing in either of the specifications of error that requires special notice. Neither of them is sustained.\nJudgment affirmed."}
