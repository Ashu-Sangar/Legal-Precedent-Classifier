{"id": "1938590", "contents": "Opinion by\nJustice Jones,\nAppellant was found guilty by a jury of forcible rape. Following disposition of post-trial motions, he was sentenced to a term of five to fifteen years. That judgment of sentence was unanimously affirmed per curiam by the Superior Court. Com. v. Morris, 217 Pa. Superior Ct. 762, 268 A. 2d 185 (1970). We granted allocatur to consider one narrow issue: whether the trial court erred by not allowing appellant to examine at trial, for purposes of cross-examination, certain verbatim notes relative to the crime made by a State Trooper while in conference with the victim.\nOne day after the commission of the crime, the victim was interviewed by a state trooper. Defense counsel\u2019s request to inspect these notes, made at the beginning of cross-examination of the victim was denied by the trial judge for the reason that there was no \u201cstatement\u2019\u2019, only notes by the trooper. Although the victim neither signed nor read the trooper\u2019s notes, she did testify, \u201c[h]e took down every word I said.\u201d Perhaps due to this ruling, the trooper was not cross-examined about his report.\nIf we conclude that this report constitutes a statement by the victim, Com. v. Kontos, 442 Pa. 343, 276 A. 2d 830 (1971), mandates a reversal. Notwithstanding Pa. R. Crim. P. 310, we unequivocally held in Kontos that relevant,, pre-trial statements of witnesses in the possession of the Commonwealth must be made available to the accused, upon request, during, the trial. The pivotal question, in our view, is whether the verbatim notes made by the trooper should have been made available for defense inspection during the trial. As in Kontos, we have no occasion to consider the related question whether such notes should be discoverable prior to trial since no request was made.\nRelying on our decision in Com. v. Smith, 417 Pa. 321, 208 A. 2d 219 (1965), the Superior Court in Com. v. Kubacki, 208 Pa. Superior Ct. 523, 224 A. 2d 80 (1966), concluded that a transcript of a tape-recorded interview between a witness and police investigators should have been made available for defense inspection. Further, the Superior Court ruled in Com. v. Swierczewski, 215 Pa. Superior Ct. 130, 257 A. 2d 336 (1969), that it was error to deny inspection of a police report prepared in the course of duty by an investigating police officer from statements made by other police officers. See, also, Com. v. Jainlett, 217 Pa. Superior Ct. 406, 407-410, 271 A. 2d 886, 887-88 (1970) (concurring opinion).\nThe Commonwealth cites United States ex rel. Felton v. Rundle, 410 F. 2d 1300 (3d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 993 (1970), in support of its contention that the trial judge did not err in refusing defense counsel\u2019s request. In Felton an investigating officer prepared a report from an interview with a witness which was not signed by that witness. Defense counsel requested permission to inspect that report during cross-examination of that witness. Although the motion was denied, the court carefully instructed counsel that this request could be renewed during cross-examination of the officer. The court also indicated that the witness could be recalled for further cross-examination if necessary. However, counsel did not follow this path and the Third Circuit concluded the court did not err in denying immediate access to the report. In the instant appeal, counsel\u2019s request was flatly denied and unaccompanied by any suggestion that the matter could be reconsidered when the trooper took the stand. For this reason, we deem Felton to be inapposite.\nAlthough we doubted the \u201cdiscoverability\u201d of an assistant district attorney\u2019s memorandum concerning an interview with a witness in Com. v. Collins, 440 Pa. 368, 373, 269 A. 2d 882, 885 (1970), that decision principally turned upon the tardiness of counsel\u2019s request and the scribbled nature of the notes.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court and the judgment of sentence imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County are reversed and a new trial is granted."}
