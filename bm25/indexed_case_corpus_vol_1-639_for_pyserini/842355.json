{"id": "842355", "contents": "Per. Curiam,\nIt is a well understood principle of law that interest does not run upon a contract, unless especially provided for therein, until the time fixed for payment. In other words, interest will not be allowed until the time of payment has arrived, unless especially contracted for.\nThere is nothing in this case to show a contract to pay interest on this claim, and we think the court below was right in entering judgment for the principal without interest.\nJudgment affirmed."}
