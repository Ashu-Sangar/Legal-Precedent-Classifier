{"id": "8731414", "contents": "OPINION\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAt issue on these appeals is whether appellant Edwin Meredith, while on trial before a jury for his alleged criminal involvement in the shooting death of one person and the beating of another, should have been permitted to establish that one of his witnesses, Geraldine Stetler, has been acquitted on charges arising out of the same incident. Unlike the trial court, we are satisfied that appellant validly sought to introduce evidence of his witness\u2019s acquittal for the limited purpose of removing a \u201ccloud\u201d cast over the witness\u2019s testimony by Commonwealth evidence indicating the witness\u2019s involvement in the alleged crimes. Because the court erred in refusing appellant\u2019s valid request for permission to make limited use of evidence of his witness\u2019s acquittal, judgment of sentence must be vacated and appellant must be granted a new trial.\nI\nThe episode giving rise to the present prosecution was the culmination of long-standing animosity between Robert and Nancy Mendel, alleged victims of criminal activity, and their next-door neighbors, James and Geraldine Stetler, as well as James Horner (Geraldine Stetler\u2019s first husband and friend of the Stetlers) and David Horner, his son by Geraldine Stetler. Appellant Meredith is a friend of the Stetlers and Horner.\nBy the Commonwealth\u2019s account of the episode, on the evening of May 7, 1977, James Horner and appellant threatened and assaulted Nancy Mendel in order to provoke her husband, Robert Mendel. Robert Mendel fended off the attack and called the police. That same evening, while standing on a front porch common to both the Mendel and Stetler residences and awaiting the arrival of the police, Robert Mendel allegedly was pulled inside the Stetler home by appellant and James Homer. There, with separate weapons, both James Stetler and David Horner shot Mendel in the back.\nWhen police arrived, appellant as well as James and David Horner and James and Geraldine Stetler were taken to the Police Administration Building. All five were arrested and charged. Geraldine Stetler\u2019s trial was held before appellant\u2019s. She was acquitted.\nAppellant was tried on charges of criminal homicide, including voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, criminal conspiracy, and aggravated and simple assault. In presenting the Commonwealth\u2019s case against appellant to the jury, the prosecutor also brought out evidence of Geraldine Stet-ler\u2019s relationship to the alleged shooting. For example, the prosecutor asked William McBurnie, a neighbor of the Men-dels, if he saw any of the Stetlers or Horners aft\u00e9r the police arrived at the scene. The following colloquy ensued:\n\u201cA. I saw them bringing the people out, out of the Horner [sic] household.\nQ. \"Who was the first person you saw brought out?\nA. Geraldine Stetler.\u201d\nThe prosecutor pursued the inquiry, dwelling upon what happened upon the arrival of police. After ascertaining that a policeman had kicked in the door of the Stetler house, pulled his gun, and gone into the house, the prosecutor and McBurnie had the following exchange:\n\u201cQ. And how long after that did you see Mrs. Stetler?\nA. It was a while. I mean, it wasn\u2019t right away. About 15 minutes maybe.\nQ. And where did she come out of the house?\nA. The front door.\nQ. And where was\u2014\nA. The policeman brought her out and put her in the back seat of a regular police car.\nQ. And where was Robert Mendel at the time?\nA. He was laying on the step.\nQ. And how did she get down from her door to the police car?\nA. Stepped over him.\u201d\nThe prosecutor produced similar evidence regarding Geraldine Stetler on the examination of Ronald Herling, the police officer answering a call informing police of the shooting. After Officer Herling testified that he had observed Geraldine Stetler holding a gun, the following colloquy ensued between the prosecuting attorney and Herling:\n\u201cQ. And what did Mrs. Stetler do with the gun? What did you do in relationship to the gun after you saw her having it in her hand?\nA. I started to approach her and she made the statement: I did it, I shot him.\nQ. What did you do, sir?\nA. At that point I took the rifle off of her and told her she was under arrest.\u201d\nThe prosecuting attorney produced a rifle, which Herling identified as the rifle he had taken from Geraldine Stetler. The prosecuting attorney then had Herling demonstrate to the jury how Geraldine Stetler had been holding the rifle when he first observed it.\nAdditionally, Nancy Mendel, victim of the alleged assault and spouse of the decedent, gave testimony regarding Geraldine Stetler\u2019s involvement. After implicating appellant in both the alleged assault against her and the shooting of her husband, Nancy Mendel stated that she heard Geraldine Stetler say, \u201c \u2018WTien the police get here, tell them I did it.\u2019 \u201d The prosecuting attorney then repeated this testimony referring to Geraldine Stetler\u2019s statement, asking the witness what amount of time elapsed between Geraldine Stetler\u2019s statement and the arrival of police.\nAppellant denied the existence of any agreement either to assault Nancy Mendel or to kill Robert Mendel. According to appellant, the Mendels were the sole aggressors. On appellant\u2019s version, Robert Mendel was shot after he had burst into the Stetler residence, swinging a bat, destroying the Stetlers\u2019 furniture and threatening those inside.\nThe defense called as a witness previously-acquitted Geraldine Stetler. After describing numerous instances in which the victim Robert Mendel had displayed violent tendencies, she confirmed the defense version that, just before the shooting, Robert Mendel had burst into the Stetler residence, swinging an object. She claimed that she had then seen \u201cwhat looked like sparks.\u201d She also testified that, when police arrived, she had said, \u201cI did it,\u201d and that, once in police custody, she had given police a statement. However, she further testified that the statement was untrue insofar as it contained an admission that she had shot Robert Mendel.\nNear the conclusion of Geraldine Stetler\u2019s direct testimony, appellant sought permission to ask the witness \u201cwhether she was charged in this case and whether those charges have been disposed of and how they were disposed of, just so that there would be no cloud over this witness.\u201d The court denied the request, stating, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s relevant.\u201d The defense completed its case and the jury returned verdicts of guilty of murder of the first degree, criminal conspiracy, and simple assault.\nOn written post-verdict motions, appellant lodged objection to the exclusion of the acquittal evidence. The post-verdict court viewed appellant's offer of Geraldine Stetler\u2019s acquittal as similar to cases of this Court where a defendant has been refused permission generally to introduce evidence of a co-defendant\u2019s acquittal as evidence that the defendant is equally innocent. See e. g., Commonwealth v. Amato, 449 Pa. 592, 297 A.2d 462 (1972), and Commonwealth v. Graham, 467 Pa. 417, 358 A.2d 56 (1976) (plurality opinion). The post-verdict court agreed with the trial court that evidence of Geraldine Stetler\u2019s acquittal had \u201cno relevance.\u201d The court then imposed a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder conviction, a concurrent term of five to ten years on the conspiracy conviction, and a term of one to two years on the simple assault conviction, to run concurrent to the life sentence but consecutive to the sentence of five to ten years. These appeals followed.\nII\nIt is certainly true that a person accused of crime may not introduce evidence of the acquittal of another person charged in connection with the same episode to create an impression before the jury that the defendant is equally innocent. As this Court observed in Commonwealth v. Amato, supra, where such a general offer was made and refused, resolution of the issue whether the defendant committed a murder during a felony is \u201cnot . . . aided in the slightest by the admission of evidence of the fact that another jury concluded that another defendant had not committed the robbery-murder.\u201d 449 Pa. at 596-97, 297 A.2d at 465. See also Commonwealth v. Byrd, 490 Pa. 544, 417 A.2d 173 (1980).\nHere, however, the record is clear that, contrary to the views of the trial court, the post-verdict court, and the Commonwealth, appellant did not seek to introduce evidence of Geraldine Stetler\u2019s acquittal generally in the manner proscribed by cases such as Amato. Instead, appellant sought to introduce evidence of Geraldine Stetler\u2019s acquittal for the narrow, limited purpose of clarifying the disposition of the arrest of Geraldine Stetler brought out on earlier presentation of Commonwealth evidence and thus to dispel any unfavorable impression of his witness which jurors might well have formed as a result of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence relating to the charges against her.\nOn this record, appellant\u2019s request to introduce evidence of Geraldine Stetler\u2019s acquittal for the limited purpose of removing the cloud of criminal charges over his witness, created by Commonwealth evidence, was entirely proper. In Commonwealth v. Quaranta, 295 Pa. 264, 145 A. 89 (1928), the defendant and two of his witnesses had been indicted on a charge of homicide. Much as here, the witnesses had been acquitted before the defendant\u2019s trial, but were \u201creferred to by the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses as being in the murder car at the time of the homicide. . . . \u201d 295 Pa. at 268, 145 A. at 91. Although this Court upheld the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s offers of testimony bearing on the witnesses\u2019 acquittal, it did so because, unlike here, counsel for the defendant \u201cdid not state any definite purpose for which the proof was offered.\u201d 295 Pa. at 269, 145 A. at 91. Quaranta, however, observed that, if not explained by evidence of the witness\u2019s acquittal, Commonwealth evidence tending to show the complicity of the accused and his witnesses \u201ccould be kept prominently before the jury throughout the trial, impairing, if not destroying, the value of their testimony.\u201d 295 Pa. at 271, 145 A. at 92.\nThis observation of Quaranta has been followed in Commonwealth v. Dennison, 441 Pa. 334, 272 A.2d 180 (1971). There, this Court affirmed an order of a trial court granting a new trial on the basis that on cross-examination the Commonwealth should have first questioned a defense witness regarding an alleged prior inconsistent statement before using the statement as impeachment evidence. This Court also pointed out that, as here, the court refused to permit the defense to show that a defense witness had been tried and acquitted on the same offense. \u201cWhether or not this evidence is admissible for the limited purpose as bearing on [the witness\u2019s] credibility at trial should be considered in the light of our decision in Commonwealth v. Quaranta ...\u201d 441 Pa. at 339, 272 A.2d at 182.\nUnder Quaranta, and Dennison, appellant should have been permitted to introduce evidence of Geraldine Stetler\u2019s acquittal. Without the opportunity to present such evidence, there indeed remained what appellant has termed a \u201ccloud\u201d over Geraldine Stetler\u2019s testimony. In the words of Quaranta, evidence indicating the witness\u2019s involvement was \u201ckept prominently before the jury throughout the trial, impairing, if not destroying, the value of [the witness\u2019s] testimony.\u201d Principles of fairness embodied in Quaranta, and Dennison, as well as our commitment to the integrity of the fact-finding process, require that an opportunity be given to the accused to remove this \u201ccloud.\u201d\nIll\nAny concern that the limited use appellant properly sought to make of his witness\u2019s acquittal will have the same effect as a general offer is misplaced. As Quaranta makes clear, \u201c[t]he use of the evidence should be carefully limited to this purpose by the trial judge, and its connection with the case explained to the jury.\u201d 295 Pa. at 271, 145 A. at 92. This is precisely what appellant sought by his limited offer.\nEqually misplaced is the Commonwealth\u2019s focus upon the claimed facts that \u201c[t]he prosecutor did not argue that Mrs. Stetler stood to gain by an acquittal in defendant\u2019s case nor did he exploit her status as an accused in any manner.\u201d Letter-brief of Commonwealth at 12. Even assuming that these claimed facts are true (a rather dubious assumption in light of the record revealing the prosecutor\u2019s persistence in presenting the jury with details of Geraldine Stetler\u2019s conduct), it is clear that Quaranta does not, and in fairness cannot, limit its approval of the defense\u2019s circumscribed use of acquittal evidence to cases where the prosecuting attorney somehow emphasizes or exploits evidence of the defense witness\u2019s alleged involvement. Rather, Quaranta examines whether there is Commonwealth evidence which tends to show that a defense witness is an accomplice. If there is such evidence, Quaranta makes clear that the defense may introduce evidence of the witness\u2019s acquittal, for the limited purpose of restoring the value of the defense witness\u2019s testimony.\nBecause appellant\u2019s proper effort to make limited use of his witness\u2019s acquittal was refused, judgment of sentence is vacated and appellant is granted a new trial.\nJudgment of sentence vacated and new trial granted.\nLARSEN, J., concurs in the result.\nNIX and KAUFFMAN, JJ., file dissenting opinions.\n. The court previously sustained the prosecuting attorney\u2019s objection to a question appellant sought to put to Nancy Mendel, which began, \u201cAt the trial of Mrs. Stetler where she was acquitted \u2014 .\u201d In view of our disposition we have no occasion to review this ruling.\n. Quaranta adds that \u201cthe fact of acquittal of a witness, as shown by verdict and judgment, is competent proof to affect the credibility of eyewitnesses who have testified to witness\u2019 presence at the homicide and participation therein.\u201d 295 Pa. at 271, 145 A. at 92. This additional basis for admitting evidence of a witness\u2019s acquitted is not pressed by appellant here. Our cases, however, are clear that this aspect of Quaranta, like the aspect discussed in text, remains valid today. See Commonwealth v. Gray, 441 Pa. 91, 271 A.2d 486 (1970).\n. In view of our disposition, we do not address appellant\u2019s other claims of trial error, including whether the tried court: (1) should have suppressed inculpatory statements; (2) should have permitted appellant to argue that Nancy Mendel changed her testimony; (3) improperly instructed the jury on identification testimony; (4) improperly restricted cross-examination of a prosecution witness; (5) erred in excluding inculpatory statements of David Homer and James Stetler; (6) erred in failing to exclude a police officer\u2019s testimony that appellant reported the shooting; (7) erred in permitting the continued service of a juror who had personal contact with a police witness; and (8) erred in admitting statements and acts of co-conspirators occurring after the conspiracy had allegedly ended.\nWe have, however, considered appellant\u2019s contention that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdicts. Our review of the record, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the verdict-winner, see e. g., Commonwealth v. Kichline, 468 Pa. 265, 361 A.2d 282 (1976), convinces us that the evidence is sufficient."}
