Is the plaintiff in a civil trial entitled to a for cause strike of prospective jurors with close familial, situational or financial relationships with the defendant\u2019s employer, whether direct or indirect, when the claimed negligence of the defendant occurred in the course and scope of the defendant\u2019s employment?\n2. Can a panel of the Superior Court create new law and require counsel in a civil trial to motion the court to allow an additional peremptory challenge each time a for cause challenge of a potential juror is denied and/or object continuously after the initial motion to strike the potential juror for cause is denied in order to preserve the issue for appeal?\n3. May a court in a medical malpractice trial alleging lack of informed consent by the surgeon ignore Pennsylvania common law and the Medical Care Availability and Reduction of Error Act, 40 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1303.101 et seq., and charge the jury that information received from the non-physician \u201cqualified staff\u2019 at the hospital can be considered in deciding whether the surgeon obtained the informed consent of the patient for surgery.\nThe Petition for Allowance of Appeal is DENIED with respect to Petitioner\u2019s fourth stated issue."}
