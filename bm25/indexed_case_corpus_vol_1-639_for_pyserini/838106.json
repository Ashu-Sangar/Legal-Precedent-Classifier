{"id": "838106", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Williams,\nIt is conceded that David Boyle was at the time of his death in 1866 the owner of the land in controversy, and that both parties to this action claimed title under him. The plaintiff seeks to recover, as one of the children and heirs at law, his distributive share in his father\u2019s real estate under the intestate laws. The defendants rely upon the last will and testament of David Boyle, by the terms of which he devised an estate in this land to his wife. If that estate was for life only then the plaintiff would seem to be entitled to a verdict ; but if it was an estate in fee simple then the defendants are her successors in title and the plaintiff cannot recover. This controversy depends therefore on the construction of the will which is in the following form : \u201c As to my worldly goods, after my just debts are paid, I give and bequeath to my loving wife Rhoda all my. property real and personal, for her support during her natural life-time; any remainder at her decease to be disposed of by her, as she may think just and right, among my children.\u201d The real estate consisted of a one half interest in a farm of ninety acres. The personal estate consisted of three cows, some farming tools and his household furniture. The total value of both real and personal estate was probably at the time of testator\u2019s death not far from two thousand dollars. The will was duly probated and the widow took possession under it. \u25a0 She used the property for about two years and died. By her will she divided the real estate between two sons, John C. and Henry. She gave the personal estate in equal parts to Andrew, another son, and to the four daughters. The plaintiff was at this time in California, whither he had gone as early as 1857, and where he had continued to reside. He had been absent for eleven years when his mother made her will, and whether she knew that he was living does' not appear. She did not name him in her will. Mrs. Boyle\u2019s will was duly proved and John C. and Henry went into possession and they and those holding under them have remained in possession from the death of their mother in 1868 down to the bringing of this suit in 1890. When they took possession the land was of little value and the improvements were unimportant. During the twenty-two years that had elapsed when this suit was brought two lines of railroad had been built over this little farm. The region in which it lies had been developed, and the value of the land greatly increased. After this lapse of time and this great change in the value of the property, the plaintiff brings his action on the theory that his father\u2019s will gave to his mother only a life estate with a power of appointment among his children in fee; and as he was not named in her will the execution of the power of appointment was for that reason defective, and no title passed under it. Upon the death of Mrs. Boyle without having made a valid appointment he contends that the real estate' descended to the heirs at law of David Boyle, of whom he is one, and he asks to be allowed to recover one eighth part of the real estate of which his father died seized.\nThe question thus presented is over the estate given by the will of David Boyle to his wife Rhoda. It can admit of no doubt that the primary object of the testator\u2019s solicitude was his wife. Their children had reached maturity and most of them were settled in homes of their own. If his wife survived him she would need the care and support that he could no longer provide in person. He accordingly made his will putting all that he had into her hands, that she might use it \u201c for her support during her natural life.\u201d The words of the will import an absolute gift. \u201c I give and bequeath to my loving wife, Rhoda, all my property real and personal.\u201d The reason he gives for this disposition of his property shows that he intended to invest her with a power of disposal, for he explains that it is \u201c for her support.\u201d A life estate in his undivided one half of ninety acres would have been practically valueless to her in the condition in which the land then was. The words relied upon as conferring a power of appointment show with equal certainty the testator\u2019s purpose to give her a power of sale of the real as well as the personal property. He says, \u201c any remainder at her decease,\u201d thus clearly indicating his idea that, there might be nothing at all left to go to any one ; but if anything should remain of the estate so given to his wife he ex- . presses a wish that it may \u201c be disposed of \u201d not in a manner directed by him, but \u201c by her as she may think just and right among my children.\u201d There is therefore a power of sale to be exercised during her lifetime for her support, and a power to dispose by will of \u201c any remainder \u201d left unsold and unconsumed. In the exercise of this power of disposition she is not bound by any rule of distribution which the testator lays down, but is left to do what, in view of her children\u2019s circumstances and condition, may seem to her mother\u2019s heart right and just when she comes to prepare her will.\nThis view of the will is conclusive of this case. It gives the widow a fee with all its incidents, including the power to sell and the power to devise, accompanied by the expressed.wish of the testator that if anything shall be left unsold it may go to their children. Not necessarily in equal parts, or to all the children, but to so many and in such proportions as she may determine, when the time comes, to be \u201c right and just.\u201d The words referring to \u201c any remainder \u201d do not limit his wife\u2019s estate or the preceding words of gift, but are precatory. They show his wish that if anything remains out of the little he left to his wife it may go to their children, but he submits the whole subject to her sense of right.\nIt is suggested that the words of trust and confidence employed by the testator operate to destroy her estate and turn her into a trustee for all the children, so that she could not change their relative rights or interfere with the trust estate further than to use its income during her natural life. But words of trust and confidence, without more, do not create a trust or turn a devisee into a trustee. The intention of the testator to create a trust must be apparent, apart from the mere existence of words of trust and confidence, or none will be held to exist.\nThe history of the rise, decline and fall, in this state, of the doctrine that words of confidence import a trust, is illustrated in the several cases arising under Pennock\u2019s will. The doctrine was borrowed several centuries ago by the English courts from the Roman law, and was first recognized and applied in this state in Coates\u2019s Appeal, 2 Pa. 129, which arose upon Pennock\u2019s will. A bequest of personal estate was made by the testator to his. wife, absolutely, followed by these words: \u201chaving full confidence that she will leave the surplus to be divided at her decease justly among my children.\u201d Upon these words ifi was held that the widow became a trustee for the children so that she could not use the corpus of the gift to her, but only the income derived therefrom. A few years later the same bequest came under consideration in McKonkey\u2019s Appeal, 18 Pa. 253, and it was then held that the widow was not restricted in the use of the bequest to her by the words of confidence, but only in the disposition of the surplus remaining at her death. The conclusion then reached was that as to such surplus the will of her husband clothed her with a power in the nature of a trust, so that all the children were beneficiaries and entitled to share to some, though not necessarily to the same, extent in the unconsumed surplus of the gift to her. Finally in Pennock\u2019s Appeal, 20 Pa. 268, the same bequest was before this court for the third time and the doctrine of a power in the. nature of a trust, arising from words of confidence, was repudiated. The last vestige of the Roman doctrine on the subject, was discarded, and in a well reasoned opinion it was held that\u2019 the gift to the widow was absolute. The words of confidence were precatory; and both as to the income and the corpus the power of the widow as owner was without limitation.\nOur later cases, with perhaps one or two exceptions, in which the question was obscured by other considerations, have fdlowed Pennock\u2019s Appeal. In Kinter v. Jenks et al., 43 Pa. 445, the testator gave the residue of his estate to his wife for her use and comfort and to be disposed of as she pleased at her death, \u201c when no doubt she will make distribution of the same among our children.\u201d These words were held to give the wife an estate in fee simple. In Becks\u2019 Appeal, 46 Pa. 527, the testator gave, inter alia, an annual sum to be paid to his wife \u201cfor house rent.\u201d The executor claimed the right to withhold this annual sum for such years as the widow paid no house rent. We held the words, \u201c for house rent,\u201d to be explanatory merely; and that it was the duty of the executor to pay the annual sum without inquiring what was done with it. A similar question was raised in Jauretche v. Proctor. The testator gave certain real and personal estate to his wife absolutely, but added \u201c she not to divest herself of what I may leave her until after her death; \u201d and directing that she should divide what then remained \u201c in equal shares among my children.\u201d It was contended that under the terms of this will the widow took a life estate only, but this court held that she took a fee, and sustained her deed made some time before her death. A still stronger case was presented in the Second Reformed Presbyterian Church v. Disbrow, 52 Pa. 219. The testator gave real estate to his wife by his will with words of habendum, \u201c to have and to hold and enjoy during her life time, and dispose of the same as shall seem best unto her.\u201d In the following clause he added: \u201c It is my wish and desire that my wife will leave at her death the property, or any part that may be then remaining in her hands, for the benefit of young men studying for the ministry.\u201d We held that the wife took a fee simple and that the words of confidence, expressive also of his desire, did not limit her estate in any particular. No less in point is Bowlby v. Thunder, 105 Pa. 173. In that case the testator gave his estate to his wife absolutely. Then followed words of trust and confidence that she would divide the estate at her decease among their children and grandchildren. We held these words to be precatory and the estate of the wife a fee. Paisley\u2019s Appeal, 70 Pa. 153, resembled Becks\u2019 Appeal, supra. The testator followed the words of gift employed in his will by words explanatory of his purpose in making the gift. The explanatory words were held to have no effect upon the gift.\nIn Hopkins v. Glunt, 111 Pa. 287, the testator followed the words of gift with words that were strongly precatory and it was contended that they qualified the gift. This contention was not sustained, but the general rule was stated to be \u201c After an unqualified devise by the testator precatory words to his devisee cannot defeatthe estate previously granted.\u201d\nNor will words declaratory of the testator\u2019s opinion or understanding have that effect. Thus in McIntyre v. McIntyre, 123 Pa. 329, testator gave certain real estate to his wife and then added, \u201c She will not have power to sell, but may leave the same to her children.\u201d This court did not adopt the testator\u2019s view of the legal effect of his devise, but held that she had full power to sell. Perhaps the latest ease on this subject is Good v. Fichthorn, decided one year ago and reported\u2018in 144 Pa. 287. The testator in that case as in the case under consideration gave his entire estate to his wife. In case she did not consume the whole estate he made the following direction : \u201c I do hereby enjoin and direct her \u201d to make a will and divide the remainder in a manner which he proceeded to indicate. We held, in an opinion by our Brother Mitchell, which fully sustained the judgment, that words of command addressed by the devisor to the devisee are as ineffectual to reduce a fee to an estate for life, as precatory or explanatory words. This does not disturb the rule that words importing a fee may be limited in their operation and the estate reduced, where, upon the whole will, it is clear that the testator intended only a life estate, as was the case in Uri'ck\u2019s Appeal, 81 Pa. 336; but what we now say is' that mere precatory words, or words of command, or words of explanation, are not enough to establish an intention that is not to be gathered from a consideration of the operative words upon the face of the instrument.\nIn the case before us the intent of the testator appears from the apt words of gift employed, and from the explanatory words in immediate connection. If these words were transferred from the close, to the beginning of the words of gift, the sentence would read thus: \u201c Por the support of my loving wife Rhoda during her natural life I give her all my property real and personal.\u201d Such transposition to aid in reaching a testator\u2019s intention was adopted, and the practice sanctioned, in Merkel\u2019s Appeal, 109 Pa. 235, where the order of the bequests was changed in order to ascertain the testator\u2019s purpose.\nThe appellee places much reliance on Follweiler\u2019s Appeal, 102 Pa. 581, and Cox v. Sims, 125 Pa. 522, but they do not sustain his position. In Follweiler\u2019s Appeal the testator\u2019s gift of his real and personal estate to his wife was made in express terms for life only, and the devise was construed in accordance with the words of the devisor. In Cox v. Sims the testator gave certain real and personal estate to his wife \u201c to have and hold the same for and during the whole period of her natural life,\u201d and then devised the remainder to his children share and share alike. We held the devise over was good as to the real estate and took effect upon the termination, of the wife\u2019s life; but that it was bad as to the personal estate since an absolute gift of personalty for life clothes the donee with all the attributes of ownership. It is therefore apparent that these cases are in entire harmony with Pennock\u2019s Appeal, supra, and the long line of cases in which it has been followed.\nAs the title to David Boyle\u2019s real and personal estate passed to his wife under his will, and to the defendants or those under whom they claim by virtue of her will, the plaintiff has no title whatever, and the consideration of the other questions raised \u25a0becomes unimportant.\nThe judgment is reversed."}
