{"id": "998763", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nIt will serve no good purpose to recite the undisputed facts upon which the court below surcharged the appellant. It is sufficient to say they left him no escape from the decree made. Every opportunity was given him to relieve himself, if he could, from the consequences which have resulted from his unfaithfulness as trustee, but he failed to do so, and the decree must, therefore, be affirmed.\nAppeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
