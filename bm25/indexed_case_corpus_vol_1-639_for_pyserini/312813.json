Accordingly, it is hereby ordered that the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is granted on the Petitioner\u2019s first issue of waiver; that the order of the Superior Court is vacated; and that this case is remanded to the Superior Court for a determination by the court as to whether the Commonwealth waived the application of the law of the case doctrine by having failed to raise and preserve the issue in the trial court. Jurisdiction is relinquished."}
