Appellants appealed to this court. Altemose C. Co. v. B. & C. T. Council of Phila., 449 Pa. 194, 296 A.2d 504 (1972), cert. denied 411 U.S. 932, 93 S.Ct. 1901, 36 L.Ed.2d 392 (1973).\nIn March of 1973, appellants moved to modify or dissolve the preliminary injunction. A hearing was held and on September 11, 1973, the court below entered a decree refusing to modify or dissolve the preliminary injunction. This appeal followed.\nWe are of the opinion that appellants\u2019 attempt to appeal from the denial to dissolve or modify the preliminary injunction must be quashed. In Meng v. Meng, 380 Pa. 110, 110 A.2d 225 (1955), this court stated:\n\u201cThe order of the Court below refusing to dissolve the preliminary injunction and permitting the appellee to file a bond nunc pro tunc, being interlocutory only and therefore not appealable, the appeal is quashed.\u201d At page 111, at page 225 of 110 A.2d.\nMoreover, if appellants attempt to appeal the denial of their request to modify the preliminary injunction was premised on the Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, Article 5, Section 502(c), 17 P.S., Section 211.502(c), which provides :\n\u201cInterlocutory Appeals\u2014\n\u201cA petition for allowance of appeal from an interlocutory order shall be filed within twenty days of its entry,\u201d\nthe appeal was untimely. The Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County entered its order denying appellants\u2019 request for a modification of the preliminary injunction on September 11, 1973, and appellants\u2019 appeal was filed on October 4, 1973, well past the prescribed twenty-day period.\nAppeal quashed.
