{"id": "574824", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nThis appeal is from. the judgment of sentence imposed upon Mack Ceasar Dancer following his conviction by a jury of murder in the second degree. We affirm.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established the following facts:\nAt approximately 12:30 a.m. on the morning of October 23, 1971, Albert Tatum, brandishing a knife, entered the house of Suzv Hayes with the announced purpose of killing Elsie Turner, Mrs. Hayes aunt. Tatum, evidencing some degree of intoxication, searched about briefly for Mrs. Turner and when asked to leave, swung at the Hayes woman with his knife. At this point, Dancer, the appellant, who had been making repairs to a room of the house, armed himself with a knife and intervened, scuffling briefly with the victim. As the door was locked against him, Tatum said, \u201cMack you cut me\u201d and \u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201d\nAbout 2:30 a.m. Tatum\u2019s body was discovered by the Lancaster police on the sidewalk about thirty yards from the Hayes\u2019 house. Medical examination revealed he had been dead from one and a half to two hours, and death was caused by a single puncture wound in the left mid-thoracic region which resulted in massive hemorrhaging.\nDuring the course of the police investigation, a somewhat equivocal statement was obtained from Dancer which was later admitted in evidence at trial. Therein, Dancer admitted the altercation with Tatum, saying that after the latter had thrust his knife at Mrs. Hayes, he [Dancer] \u201cmade a hit at him [Tatum] with my knife. I don\u2019t know if he was hit or not, I did not stab Mm. I made a cutting motion with the knife. It was all over then, he said, \u2018I\u2019ll be back.\u2019 When he walked out the front door he said, \u2018You cut me, I\u2019ll get you.\u2019 \u201d\nAlthough two issues are presented by appellant for determination, only one of them is properly before this Court. In support of his request for a new trial, appellant contends: (1) the lower court committed error in permitting the Commonwealth to impeach its own witness, Mrs. Hayes, by introducing on redirect examination a prior inconsistent statement; and (2) the court compounded this error by presenting the contents of the statement in its charge as substantive evidence.\nWe need not reach the merits of the second contention. A study of the record discloses that no specific exception to the challenged instruction was made of record. More importantly, however, this alleged assignment of error was not raised in the motion for a new trial or at any time in the court below. Under such circumstances, this question may not be raised now. Commonwealth v. Agie, 449 Pa. 187, 296 A. 2d 741 (1972); Commonwealth v. Myers, 439 Pa. 381, 266 A. 2d 756 (1970).\nThe facts relative to the other assignment of error are these:\nMrs. Hayes was called as a Commonwealth witness and recounted the events which culminated in the affray between Dancer and Tatum. She said she saw Dancer make a stroking motion alongside decedent\u2019s left leg but did not notice a knife in Dancer\u2019s hand until after the door was shut against decedent. Asked by the district attorney whether she saw Dancer withdraw a knife from Tatum\u2019s chest, the witness answered, \u201cNo, whatever happened was so fast. No I didn\u2019t. No, I can\u2019t say that I did.\u201d Questioned whether a knife was anywhere near Tatum\u2019s chest, Mrs. Hayes responded, \u201cNot that I saw. Mack was between me and him. I was standing behind Mm and I don\u2019t know what took place when they went together. But I know that I saw the two of them go together.\u201d She further testified that when the combatants drew apart, she thought she saw a spot of blood near the decedent\u2019s stomach and heard Tatum say, \u201cMack you cut me.\u201d The district attorney then asked Mrs. Hayes if her testimony was in any way different from statements made to the police who interviewed her on October 23rd. The witness said she could not remember what she had told the police but said that she didn\u2019t think she had left anything out in her present account. On that note, direct testimony was ended.\nOn redirect, Mrs. Hayes was asked if she had ever given a written statement to the police and she readily admitted doing so. Over defense counsel\u2019s objection, the witness was then directed to read aloud the following portion of this statement: \u201cAt this time, everything happened so fast but I saw Albert and Mack Dancer come together and then I saw Mack pull his knife out of Albert\u2019s chest and I saw blood on the knife.\u201d Afterwards, Mrs. Hayes said: \u201cI don\u2019t remember making that statement.\u201d It is contended permitting this cross-examination and impeachment of Mrs. Hayes was prejudicial error.\nThe fundamental rule is that \u201c[i]t is within the sound discretion of the trial court to decide whether or not counsel may exercise the right of cross-examining his own witnesses and its action will not be reviewed by the appellate courts unless there is an abuse of discretion.\u201d Commonwealth v. Conard, 206 Pa. Superior Ct. 33, 42, 211 A. 2d 14 (1965); cert. denied, 384 U.S. 920 (1966). Instantly, we feel there was an abuse of discretion.\nThe general principles of law pertaining to impeachment of one\u2019s own witnesses were discussed at length in Commonwealth v. Knudsen, 443 Pa. 412, 278 A. 2d 881 (1971). There we said: \u201cThe courts of this Commomvealth. have been liberal in allowing a party to cross-examine his own witness when it is believed that the interest of truth and justice so require. E.g., Commonwealth v. Smith, 424 Pa. 544, 227 A. 2d 653 (1967) ; Commonwealth v. Turza, 340 Pa. 128, 16 A. 2d 401 (1940); Commonwealth v. Lehman, 309 Pa. 486, 164 Atl. 526 (1932); Commonwealth v. Spardute, 278 Pa. 37, 122 Atl. 161 (1923); Commonwealth v. Reeves, 267 Pa. 361, 110 Atl. 158 (1920); Commonwealth v. Delfino, 259 Pa. 272, 102 Atl. 949 (1918); Commonwealth v. Deitrick, 221 Pa. 7, 70 Atl. 275 (1908). In all the cited cases, however, the witness sought to be cross-examined had made statements at trial which were directly contradictory to statements the witness had made earlier, and the in-court testimony, if believed, was such as to aid the opposing party. \u2018On the other hand, our courts have been loath to allow cross-examination for purposes of impeachment by use of prior statements when a witness states that he does not know or that he cannot remember. This is so for the reason that such an in-court declaration does not harm the calling party nor aid the opposing party, [citations omitted] Hence, when a witness claims he does not know or cannot remember, the prior statements should not be introduced because of the danger that the prior statements will be considered as substantive evidence by the jury.\u2019 \u201d 443 Pa. at 414-15. See also Commonwealth v. Stafford, 450 Pa. 252, 299 A. 2d 590 (1973).\nThe sum and substance of Mrs. Hayes\u2019 testimony was that she did not see the stabbing because her line of vision was blocked. While such testimony may have been disappointing, it was certainly not prejudicial or injurious to the Commonwealth\u2019s case. As was the case in Krmdsen, supra, there was no substantive evidence in her trial testimony which could have been neutralized by the use of her pretrial statement.\nWe are convinced, however, that this error was harmless in the face of the overwhelming evidence of guilt.\nThere was ample evidence of an affray between appellant and decedent involving knife play. Mrs. Hayes testified that she thought she saw blood on Tatum\u2019s stomach when the two men drew apart and then noticed that Dancer too had a knife in his hand. There was general agreement that Tatum told Dancer, \u201cYou cut me, I\u2019ll be back,\u201d a res gestae declaration. Tatum\u2019s body was found at about 2:30 a.m. on the sidewalk thirty yards from the spot where the fight took place. The deputy coroner estimated death had occurred one and a half to two hours earlier. Mrs. Hayes placed Tatum\u2019s visit to her house at 12:30 to 12:45 a.m. and judging by the record he ivas there for only a few minutes. The only evidence of trauma to the body was the single puncture wound of the chest caused by a sharp instrument. Detective Benedict of the Lancaster Police Department related finding the victim\u2019s wallet on his person containing identification papers and $71 in cash. He also testified that police found a small pocketknife with an approximately two and one-half inch blade in Tatum\u2019s jacket. The knife was in a closed position.\nThese latter two pieces of evidence seem to exclude any theory that Tatum was killed after he left the Hayes house as a part of a robbery attempt or that he had fallen on his own knife.\nJudgment affirmed.\nThe coroner testified that a ltnife or other sharp instrument had pierced the heart and caused extensive bleeding into the chest cavity.\n\u201cSince the purpose of the cross-examination and impeachment is, then, to induce the jury to disbelieve the testimony of the witness, \u2014there must be something in the witness\u2019 testimony, which, if not disbelieved by the jury will be hurtful or injurious to the party \u00abming him.\u201d Selden v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, 157 Pa. Superior Ct. 500, 508, 43 A. 2d 571 (1945)."}
