{"id": "465145", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Chief Justice.\nAppellants Suburban Manor/Highland Hall Care Center and GolMew Manor Nursing Home (\u201cnursing homes\u201d), appeal from an Order of the Commonwealth Court affirming certain adjustments made by the Department of Public Welfare (\u201cDPW\u201d) to Appellants\u2019 cost reports for the fiscal years ending June 30, 1981, June 30, 1983, and June 30, 1984. Suburban Manor/Highland Hall Care Center v. Department of Public Welfare, 146 Pa.Commw. 129, 604 A.2d 1185 (1992) (hereinafter Suburban). Specifically, Appellants claim-that five adjustments to reimbursements made pursuant to the Pennsylvania Medical Assistance Program (Medicaid) were improper. Three of these adjustments involved depreciation: (1) the allocation of the purchase price of the nursing homes; (2) the disallowance of the vendor\u2019s depreciation based on its gain on sale; and (3) the computation of useful asset lives. The remaining two adjustments involve interest: (1) the disallowance of interest expense as to debt below the depreciation basis; and (2) the disallowance of interest expense as to assets purchased from the prior owner\u2019s operating company. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the Order of the Commonwealth Court.\nIn June of 1981, Around the World of Pennsylvania (\u201cATW\u201d) purchased certain assets of the nursing homes from GolMew Suburban Associates (\u201cGSA\u201d). ATW paid $873,-161.13 for the assets of GolMew Manor and $1,254,892.79 for the assets of Suburban/Highland Hall. In March of 1984, ATW merged with Trade Around the World of Pennsylvania (\u201cTAW\u201d), and DPW, for auditing purposes, treated the merger as retroactive to July 1,1983.\nThe DPW then took the five actions which Appellants challenge in this matter. First, when TAW purchased the assets of the nursing homes, neither it nor the vendor assigned values to the separate assets included in the sale. Instead, TAW sought to use the reports of two independent appraisers to allocate the purchase price among the categories of land, buddings and equipment. The DPW, however, rejected the appraisals, instead determining the values of the three assets categories according to the prior owner\u2019s allocation. This resulted in lesser depreciation allowances for TAW than it would have received had the appraisals been used.\nSecond, in establishing the prior owner\u2019s depreciation, DPW disallowed most of the vendor\u2019s depreciation for its final year of operation because the sale price negotiated with TAW showed that the vendor did not suffer the economic burden of full depreciation for that year. However, when DPW determined TAW\u2019s depreciable basis in the properties, it also disallowed the depreciation allocable to the vendor, including the depreciation disallowed in the vendor\u2019s final year of ownership.\nThird, DPW assigned useful lives to the nursing homes based upon the useful lives assigned by the prior owner. Annual depreciation was then determined by dividing each asset\u2019s new cost basis by its original useful life.\nFourth, DPW determined the percentage of interest disallowance by dividing the prior owner\u2019s depreciation by the purchase price. This percentage corresponds with that portion of the loan which was used to finance the difference between each facility\u2019s purchase price and its new cost basis, and remains constant throughout the payment of the loan.\nFinally, The Department did not consider the assets purchased from Skilled Health Facilities (\u201cSHF\u201d) by TAW in determining the percentage of interest disallowance. Instead, DPW viewed this conveyance as a separate transaction.\nAppellants filed appeals with DPW regarding the above five adjustments, and an administrative hearing on these matters was held on June 23, 1988. After a final order denying the appeals in their entirety was entered on April 27, 1989, Appellants then filed an appeal with the Commonwealth Court, which found all adjustments proper as discussed more fully below. This appeal followed.\nAt the outset, we note that the DPW\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations is entitled to judicial deference unless it is plainly erroneous, inconsistent with regulations, or contrary to the enabling statute. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare v. Forbes Health Sys., 492 Pa. 77, 81, 422 A.2d 480, 482 (1980). Therefore, our scope of review is limited to a determination of whether the adjudication is supported by substantial evidence, is in accordance with the law, or violates any constitutional rights. Grandview Health Homes, Inc. v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t. of Pub. Welfare, 122 Pa.Commw. 356, 359 n. 2, 552 A.2d 720, 722 n. 2 (1988). With this narrow scope of review in mind, we turn to Appellants\u2019 contentions.\nI. Allocation of Purchase Price\nAppellants first contend that the DPW erred in allocating the purchase prices of the nursing homes according to the prior owner\u2019s allocations. Instead, Appellants assert that the DPW should have used the values assigned by the independent appraisers at the approximate time of the sale. Appellants base their argument on the fact that section IV.D.9.f of the Manual, which governs reimbursement of a long term care facility\u2019s depreciation on capital assets,, is silent as to allocation of costs to groups of assets. The section provides:\nThe cost basis for depreciable assets of a facility purchased as an ongoing operation shall be the lesser of the purchase price or the fair market value based on the lessor of at least two bona fide appraisals at the time of the sale and less any straight line depreciation by the prior owner.\nAccording to Appellants, the DPW\u2019s interpretation is illogical because the prudent purchaser who buys assets at less than fair market value ends up having its reimbursement determined by the prior owner\u2019s allocation. This in turn violates federal mandates to assure rates that are reasonable and adequate to meet costs incurred by efficiently and economically run facilities. See 42 U.S.C \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A).\nHowever, as the Commonwealth Court correctly observed, the Manual requires the assignment of a cost basis according to the lesser of the purchase price or the fair market price as appraised. Suburban, 146 Pa.Commw. at 134, 604 A.2d at 1187. Thus, the DPW properly rejected the tendered appraisals because, given that the appraisals were correctly rejected in determining the cost basis, \u201csection IV D(9)(f) does not require that the cost basis for the three asset categories, included in the total assets, be determined based upon these appraisals.\u201d Id.\nSince the transaction documents in connection with the purchases did not allow a literal interpretation of section IV.D.9.f of the Manual, and in the absence of any applicable provision in HIM-15, it was quite reasonable, as the Commonwealth Court noted, to use the prior owner\u2019s listed costs. Clearly, the failure of the transaction documents to make an allocation of the purchase price could not deprive DPW of the benefit of the provisions of section IV.D.9.f of the Manual which specified that the cost basis \u201cshall be the lesser of the purchase price or the fair market value ____\u201d (emphasis added). Where the purchase price (or allocated purchase price) cannot be determined from the transaction documents, the method adopted by the DPW in the instant case is reasonable because of the consistency it affords.\nII. Inclusion of Disallowed Depreciation Expense in Computing Prior Owner\u2019s Depreciation\nAppellants next contend that the DPW improperly considered the amount of depreciation offset by the gain on sale in computing the prior owner\u2019s depreciation. The DPW offset the seller\u2019s allowable depreciation by the amount of gain seller realized from the sale of the facilities, which Appellants concede is proper under Manual section IY.D.9.e, which provides: \u201cGains and losses realized from the disposal of depreciable assets, not to exceed 10% of the total allowable depreciation for the year, are an allowable cost.\u201d However, Appellants challenge the DPW\u2019s determination of their depreciable basis in the properties, which did not give Appellants the benefit of an increased cost basis that would result from the disallowance of the seller\u2019s depreciation in its final year of ownership.\nThe DPW correctly maintains that a buyer\u2019s cost basis under section IV.D.9.f is the purchase price \u201cless any straight line depreciation by the prior owner\u201d without regard to any reduction imposed by DPW under Manual section IV.D.9.e. Such an interpretation of section IV.D.9.f is proper since the section makes no reference to possible adjustment to the straight line depreciation under .the preceding subsection (section IV.D.9.e). Moreover, any other interpretation would result in a windfall increased cost basis (albeit a relatively small one) to the buyer.\nIII. Assignment of Useful Lives\nAppellants\u2019 contention is that, in assigning useful lives to Appellants\u2019 depreciable assets in the nursing homes, the DPW erred in relying on the useful lives assigned by the prior owner. Instead, Appellants claim that the DPW should have used an updated useful life (also known as \u201crelifing\u201d), based upon American Hospital Association (\u201cAHA\u201d) guidelines, less years of use. Appellants claim that since the Manual in effect at the time of the assignment was silent on the calculation method, HIM-15 should control. They also argue that DPW\u2019s methodology contravenes the step-up in basis, required by its own regulations.\nHowever, as the Commonwealth Court correctly observed, the DPW\u2019s regulations do not permit relifing. The court noted that it had previously considered the relifing issue in Grandview Health Homes, Inc. v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 122 Pa.Commw. 356, 552 A.2d 720 (1988), where the facility raised the exact argument Appellants assert here. The court rejected the facility\u2019s position, holding that section IV.D.9.b. of the Manual controlled, \u201cManual section IV.D.9.b clearly requires that the method and procedure used for computing depreciation must be consistent year-to-year. If asset lives were permitted to be changed, the method and procedure of calculating depreciation would not be consistent.\u201d Id. at 368, 552 A.2d at 726.\n. Recognizing that \u201cManual Section TV.D.9.a. conditions depreciation allowance on a requirement that asset lives be in accordance with IRS or AHA guidelines,\u201d id. at 369, 552 A.2d at 726, the Grandview court concluded that a new owner could assign new lives consistent with those guidelines if the prior owner did not do so. However, in applying Grandview to the present matter, the court noted that Appellants did not contend that the prior owner\u2019s lives were inconsistent with the applicable guidelines. As such, the court reasoned that the Grandview exception was inapplicable. Suburban, 146 Pa. Commw. at 139, 604 A.2d at 1190.\nWe agree with the Commonwealth Court that, contrary to Appellants\u2019 position, section IV.D.9.b controls by requiring that \u201c[t]he method and procedure for computing depreciation must be applied from year-to-year on a consistent basis.\u201d The DPW has reasonably interpreted this provision to require that once a useful life has been established by an owner, it cannot be changed by that owner or any subsequent owner. Thus, the Manual is not silent on the DPW\u2019s useful life procedure, as Appellants assert. See Homestead Nursing & Convalescent Home v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 135 Pa. Commw. 47, 51 n. 3, 579 A.2d 440, 444 n. 3 (1990) (premise-that DPW\u2019s procedure does not follow from Manual is erroneous), appeal denied, 530 Pa. 648, 607 A.2d 257 (1992).\nAppellants also claim that the DPW methodology applied here violates its own regulations concerning step-up in basis. See Manual section IV.D.9.f. (allowing increase in an asset\u2019s cost basis when it is sold). However, the DPW\u2019s methodology can result in greater depreciation to the new owner than would have been paid to the prior owner had the facility not been sold. Further, the fact that application of section 9.f can in some instances \u201cresult in the failure to permit total depreciation of the original cost basis of a facility ... is not enough to warrant an invalidation of the rule\u201d by the court. Mountain Rest Nursing Home, Inc. v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 73 Pa.Commw. 42, 48, 457 A.2d 600, 603 (1983).\nAgain, the DPW\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations must be upheld unless clearly erroneous, inconsistent with regulation, or contrary to the underlying statutes. Here, the DPW\u2019s \u2022 interpretation of section 9.a. is a reasonable one, assuring consistency in the method and procedure for computing depreciation between separate ownership periods. Thus, we agree with the Commonwealth Court that the DPW\u2019s computation of useful lives was proper.\nIV. Disallowance of Interest Expense as to Debt Below Depreciation Basis\nAppellants\u2019 fourth contention is that the DPW erred in disallowing compensation for its interest expense regarding interest payable on amounts equal to the prior owner\u2019s depreciation. Appellants claim that there is no regulatory authority for this disallowance, but that the DPW instead based its determination on the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision in Grand Oak Nursing Home, Inc. v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 116 Pa.Commw. 453, 541 A.2d 800 (1986), aff'd per curiam, 518 Pa. 54, 540 A.2d 265 (1988). The DPW, however, claims that it based its calculation on \u00a7 203 of HIM-15, which the Commonwealth Court has previously recognized as proper in both Grand Oak and Grandview.\nThe DPW is correct that Grand Oak did not grant the DPW the authority to make the adjustment at issue here, but instead merely recognized that DPW has this authority based on the Manual and HIM-15. More specifically, Grand Oak determined that since section IV.D.lO.c. of the Manual provides only general interest limitations, the DPW could read section lO.c. in concert with the more specific, restrictive interest limitations in section 203 of HIM-15. Id. at 458-59, 541 A.2d at 802-03; accord Grandview.\nSince depreciation taken by a prior owner is not an allowable capital item for the computation of depreciation by the new purchaser, it follows that section lO.c. and HIM-15 may be read together to exclude interest on such an item from capital indebtedness. Therefore, the DPW\u2019s calculation was clearly reasonable under the pertinent provisions.\nV. Disallowance of Interest Expense as to Assets From Prior Owner\u2019s Operating Company\nFinally, Appellants claim that the DPW erred in disallowing interest expense on the purchase of assets and liabilities acquired through TAW from SHF, the parent company that operated the two homes. More specifically, while DPW allowed Appellants to take depreciation on these assets, it did not consider these assets in determining the percentage of interest disallowance on the facilities\u2019 loan payment. Appellants contend that the cost and prior depreciation of these assets should be included in this computation.\nHowever, as Appellants concede in their brief, this issue is largely a factual one, and we are unable to conclude that the DPW\u2019s disregard of the TAW/SHF assets was based on factual determinations that were clearly erroneous. See Suburban, 146 Pa.Commw. at 140-41, 604 A.2d at 1190-91 (discussing lack of evidence to support Appellants\u2019 position).\nTherefore, for the reasons set forth above, we affirm the Order of the Commonwealth Court.\nPAPADAKOS, J., and MONTEMURO, J., who was sitting by designation, did not participate in the decision of this case.\nZAPPALA, J., concurs in the result.\n. The program under which Appellants sought reimbursement, codified at 62 P.S. \u00a7 443.1, is a joint federal-state program coordinated with, and partially funded by, the federal medical assistance program under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395 et seq. Federal and state manuals provide the regulations which govern the program. The federal regulations are set forth at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 447.250 et seq. and published as federal Manual HIM-15 [HIM-15]. Pennsylvania\u2019s regulations are set forth in the Manual of Allowable Cost Reimbursement for Skilled Nursing and Intermediate Care Facilities 2832-38 (1978), as amended by 10 Pa. Bulletin 3106 (1980)(hereinafter \"the Manual\"). The Manual is the principal authority governing the Pennsylvania Medicaid cost reimbursement program and prevails when its terms differ form those of HIM-15. 10 Pa. Bulletin 3107.\nThe Medicaid program provides for reimbursement of long term care facilities in two major categories: (1) per diem operating costs; and (2) capital costs allocable to services provided to Medicaid patients. All of Appellants\u2019 claims concern reimbursement for capital costs.\n. Before the Commonwealth Court, Appellants also relied upon section 104.14A of HIM-15 to support their position, and they also claimed that the DPW\u2019s methodology violated the Commonwealth Documents Law, 45 P.S. \u00a7 1102-1602. However, the Commonwealth Court rejected these arguments, see Suburban, 146 Pa.Commw. at 135-36, 604 A.2d at 1188, and they were not raised before this Court.\n. Further, even if the Manual were silent on the issue, Appellants do not point to any provision of HIM-15 which furnishes a definition for remaining useful lives. Thus, Appellant's argument that our decision in North-wood Nursing & Convalescent Home, Inc. v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 523 Pa. 483, 567 A.2d 1385 (1989), controls must fail. In Northwood, we determined that if matters are not explicitly covered by the Manual but HIM-15 furnishes detailed regulations concerning those matters, HIM-15 should apply. Id. at 488, 567 A.2d at 1387.\n. The DPW presents this example: Suppose a building was purchased in 1962 for $100,000. A useful life of 40 years was assigned, with depreciation taken at a rate of $2,500 per year. In 1982, the building had a fair market value of- $220,000 and was purchased for $200,000. The cost basis to the new owner was $150,000, obtained by taking the purchase price and subtracting the prior owner's depreciation of $50,-000 ($2,500 per year multiplied by 20 years). Applying the DPW's methodology, the new owner would be allowed to take total depreciation of $75,000, at an annualized rate of $3,750 for 20 years (obtained by dividing the $150,000 cost basis by the useful life of 40). This is 150% of the amount of depreciation the prior owner would have been entitled to had he retained ownership.\n. Section 203 of HIM-15 provides: \"[w]here a loan is obtained to finance the purchase of a facility ... and the purchase price exceeds the ... cost basis, ... interest expense on that portion of the loan used to finance the excess ... is not allowable.\u201d\n. Section IV.D.10 of the Manual merely provides that \u201d[n]ecessaiy and proper interest on both current and capital indebtedness is an allowable cost.\u201d"}
