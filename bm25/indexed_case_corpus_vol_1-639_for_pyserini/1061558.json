{"id": "1061558", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe judgment which the court below opened was entered on a warrant in a lease authorizing the entry of judgment against the lessee for breach of his covenants. The appellant, the lessor, entered the judgment for an alleged breach of a covenant, but the court found as a fact that there had been no breach. This finding has not been assigned as error, and, being therefore conclusive, the appeal must be dismissed.\nAppeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
