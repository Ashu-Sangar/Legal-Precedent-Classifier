{"id": "4203059", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice ORIE MELVIN.\nWe granted review to consider the propriety of the Superior Court\u2019s extension of the Bruton rule to a circumstance involving prosecutor commentary. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the prosecutor\u2019s remark did not negate the redaction and, therefore, did not trigger the Bruton rule. Moreover, any potential for prejudice arising from the prosecutor\u2019s comment was cured by the numerous cautionary instructions to the jury. Accordingly, we reverse the grant of a new trial and reinstate the judgment of sentence.\nOn March 11, 2005, at approximately 8:00 a.m., Philadelphia Police Officer Albert Phipps received a radio call alerting him to an incident in the 2400 block of West Turner Street in the City of Philadelphia. Officer Phipps discovered a black male, later identified as Robert Sample (\u201cthe victim\u201d), lying face down on the sidewalk directly in front of the residence at 2401 West Turner Street. The victim died from multiple gunshot wounds to the head and neck. The Crime Scene Unit collected three fired cartridge cases and a bullet fragment. A trail of the victim\u2019s personal items led from the body to the steps of 2401 West Turner Street. Notes of Testimony (N.T.) Trial, 1/22/07, at 82-84.\nHomicide Detective James Burns canvassed the area for witnesses. At approximately 4:00 a.m., he knocked on the door of 2401 West Turner Street but received no answer. Detective Burns returned with his partner, Detective Harkins, around 7:00 a.m. and once again knocked on the door. The residents of the third-floor apartment, Jamilla and Dominique Everett (collectively \u201cthe Everetts\u201d), opened the door. The detectives informed the Everetts that they were investigating the homicide and asked whether there were any other individuals in the apartment. Dominique replied that her boyfriend, Khalif Alston (\u201cAlston\u201d), was asleep in her bedroom in the rear of the apartment. Jamilla stated that her children and Ernest Cannon (\u201cAppellee\u201d) were asleep in her bedroom. After obtaining permission to enter the apartment, the detectives found Alston and Appellee in the locations identified by the Everetts. The Everetts, Alston, and Appellee denied any knowledge of the homicide but agreed to accompany the detectives to the police station for further questioning. Id. at 267-82.\nJamilla gave an initial statement at 9:30 a.m. on the day of the murder. She told detectives that she heard gunshots and went to investigate. Jamilla stated that she then saw Alston, Appellee, and Dominique smoking marijuana in her room. Jamilla claimed that she did not mention hearing shots because she assumed the noise woke the others. Jamilla told her sister that there was someone lying on the ground outside. Dominique gave two statements to the police on the morning of the murder in which she denied knowledge of the crime. Id. at 366-69, 475-87.\nLater that afternoon, the Everetts consented to a search of their apartment. The police recovered a .40 caliber semiautomatic handgun from inside the toilet tank. The handgun had one live round in the chamber and seven live rounds in the magazine. Following the search, the police transported the Everetts back to the Homicide Unit for further questioning. Id. at 382-84.\nJamilla gave a second statement after the recovery of the handgun. Jamilla indicated that she heard gunshots, after which Alston and Appellee entered the apartment and proceeded into Dominique\u2019s room. She heard one of the men say, \u2018You\u2019re f[---]ing drawn. What the f[---] did you do? We gonna both go to jail.\u201d The other responded that he had no choice because the victim tried to take the gun. Hearing sirens, Jamilla went to the window and saw the victim\u2019s body lying on the ground. Jamilla reviewed, signed, and dated the statement. Id. at 386-87.\nDominique gave the police a third sworn statement at 11:45 p.m. on March 11, 2005. She reported that Alston came into her room while Appellee entered Jamilla\u2019s room shortly after the shots were fired. According to Dominique, Jamilla joined Appellee at the window, saw the body, and began screaming at Appellee, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Appellee and Alston began to argue, and Alston stated, \u201cYou drawn.\u201d Appellee responded, \u201cThat\u2019s my gun. I ain\u2019t getting rid of it.\u201d Id. at 499-500.\nWhen the detectives interviewed Alston, he confessed to his role in the crime. He stated that he went to the Everetts\u2019 apartment around 12:30 a.m. He was gambling downstairs with several other males when Appellee arrived. The two men retreated upstairs to the Everetts\u2019 apartment, where Appellee told Alston that he was broke and ready to \u201cjam\u201d someone. Alston suggested that they go to the store and rob whomever they encountered. While returning from the store, they saw the victim, and Appellee said, \u201cLet\u2019s get him; I\u2019m ready to fade him.\u201d Alston agreed but did not want the victim to see his face. Alston told the detectives that Appellee then confronted the victim with his gun drawn. When the victim grabbed Appellee, he fired one shot. As Alston fled into the house, he heard three more shots and Appellee yelling not to lock the door. Once Appellee entered the apartment, he gave Alston some cash. N.T., 1/25/07, at 482-36.\nOn March 16, 2005, Dominique gave a fourth statement at the District Attorney\u2019s Office. Dominique stated that Alston arrived at her apartment after midnight on the date of the murder. Dominique and Alston smoked marijuana, after which Alston went downstairs to gamble. Dominique fell asleep and awoke to find Alston and Appellee in her room smoking marijuana. When they ran out of drugs, Appellee stated that he had more and asked Alston to walk with him to a store one block away. Ten minutes after Alston and Appellee left, Dominique heard a gunshot. She then heard someone running up the stairs to the apartment, followed by three more gunshots. Dominique stated that she heard Jamilla screaming at Appellee, \u201cWhat the f[---] did you do?\u201d Appellee decided to leave the apartment and picked up a gun that was lying on the kitchen table. Alston told Appellee to hide the gun. Appellee refused and insisted on leaving. After observing police at the scene, Appellee decided to remain overnight. Dominique reviewed, signed, and dated her statement. Id. at 326-29.\nFollowing consolidation of their cases, both men were tried by a jury sitting before the Honorable Sheila Woods-Skipper. In his opening statement, the prosecutor recounted the events on the date of the murder. He described the discovery of the victim\u2019s body, the recovery of the murder weapon, and the detective\u2019s initial encounter with Alston, Appellee, and the Everetts. The prosecutor also related the statements Jamilla gave to the police, implicating Alston and Appellee in the shooting.\nThe prosecutor then described the statement that co-defendant Alston gave to the police on the day of the murder. Since Appellee and Alston were being tried together, the statement had been redacted by substituting the phrase \u201cthe other guy\u201d for any reference to Appellee. As relevant herein, the prosecutor stated:\nDetectives speak to Mr. Alston. They confront him. We got this gun in here. This is what Jamilla said. What does he say? You\u2019re going to hear it. He confesses to his role in the crime. This is a case with a confession. Now, everything I\u2019ve said up to this point about the evidence against Mr. Alston and [Appellee] is admissible against both of them. Think of it this way: It\u2019s like bookends. Everything from one end to the other end comes in in this case. Everything I\u2019ve said to you up until this point is a bookend that is admissible against Mr. Alston all the way down to [Appellee]. It\u2019s admissible against both men. Her Honor is going to explain to you that a statement, a confession by Mr. Alston gives us a slightly different bookend. His statement is admissible only against him. That\u2019s the only basis that you can consider against Mr. Alston.\nWith that in mind, this is what he says. He talks about being downstairs gambling, going upstairs. \u201cWe went upstairs and I tell the other guy, that was drawn, robbing the landlord where my baby lives, the landlord that Mr. Alston was downstairs gambling with. We smoke a little weed and was just talking. The other guy pulled out a couple of bills out of his pocket and was like, damn. I\u2019m f[---]ed up, dog; like he was broke. He was like, I\u2019m ready to jam someone. And I was like, well, let\u2019s go get a Dutch at the store and if we see somebody, we will do it.\n\u201cSo [we] went down to the store on 24th and Oxford and bought two Dutches and headed back to the house. That\u2019s when we seen the boy coming up 24th street. The other guy was like, let\u2019s get him. I was like, that boy is dirty. He ain\u2019t got no money. The other guy was like, I\u2019m ready to fade him. I was like, okay. But he can\u2019t see my face because I got to come back here again. The other guy was going to put him on the ground and I was going to go into his pockets and take whatever he had.\n\u201cNext thing I knew, the other guy was on him. He got in front of him and pulled out his gun and then grabbed the boy trying to pull him in. The boy grabbed a hold of the other guy and then the other guy fired. I heard like four shots total. When the boy grabbed the other guy, the other guy pushed him off and fired the first shot. The boy went right down. I started running and I heard three more shots. While I was running to my baby\u2019s mom\u2019s house, the other guy yelled, don\u2019t lock me out. I ran in my baby\u2019s mom\u2019s house. The other guy came running in right behind me. We went upstairs to the third floor. When the other guy got up there, he was like, boy ain\u2019t got s[---]. I was like, yeah. Whatever. Then he gave me $20, two $5\u2019s and a bunch of $l\u2019s. Then we smoke some more and I went to bed with my girl.\u201d\nThose are his words, Mr. Alston\u2019s. That he agreed to participate in that robbery of a man. That he agreed he was going to go through that man\u2019s pockets when he was put on the ground. That he was going to take his proceeds, take his property for his own. The man who was chosen was [the victim]. And [the victim] died because of the greed of Mr. Alston. The evidence will show through other sources, ladies and gentlemen, the person who was with Mr. Alston, was [Appellee],\nHow do we know? We know from Dominique. Dominique Everett was interviewed. And when she was interviewed that night, she said, \u201cI hear these two men coming running upstairs. I hear them arguing over what has just taken place outside. I hear them complaining about what has just taken place outside. She\u2019s interviewed again a couple days later at the District Attorney\u2019s Office and she says, I see in [Appellee\u2019s] hands a black semiautomatic handgun. I see that gun in his hands as [Appellee] is arguing with [Mr. Alston] over the crime that just took place outside and how they are both [in a] hell [of a] lot of trouble. And I hear how [Appellee] wants to get out of there that night, have a friend call to come pick him up so he can escape. But it doesn\u2019t work because the police get there too quickly and his friend can\u2019t pick him up, so he stays the night.\nThat\u2019s the case. There\u2019s more. You will hear more. But that essentially is the case. Evidence that is overwhelming against each man for their roles in choosing to commit a robbery, in choosing a victim for their robbery, in taking property from their victim and in shooting him multiple times in the head and leaving him there to die....\nN.T., 1/22/07, at 33-38 (emphasis added).\nAt the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s opening, Appellee objected and moved for a mistrial, claiming that the prosecutor \u201cbroke the redaction\u201d by identifying Appellee as \u201cthe other guy\u201d referenced in Alston\u2019s statement. After hearing argument, the trial court denied the motion for a mistrial. At Appellee\u2019s request, the court gave the jury an immediate cautionary instruction. The trial judge reminded the jury, consistent with the initial charge, that opening statements do not constitute evidence. The judge further explained that Alston\u2019s statement could only be considered against him.\nDuring the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecution presented testimony from the Everetts. Both disavowed their earlier statements, claiming that they were made following continued harassment from the police. The Commonwealth also introduced testimony about Alston\u2019s inculpatory statement. Ballistics evidence established that the handgun found in the Everetts\u2019 apartment was the murder weapon.\nThe jury convicted Appellee of first-degree murder, robbery, conspiracy to commit robbery, and carrying a firearm on the public streets of Philadelphia. The trial court sentenced Appellee to life in prison for the murder conviction. The trial court imposed concurrent sentences of ten to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment each for robbery and conspiracy and a concurrent term of three and one-half to seven years\u2019 imprisonment for the firearm offense.\nOn appeal to the Superior Court, Appellee claimed, inter alia, that he was entitled to a new trial because of prosecutorial misconduct committed during the opening statement. Commonwealth v. Cannon, 974 A.2d 1177, unpublished memorandum (Pa.Super.2009). Appellee argued that he suffered irreparable prejudice when the prosecutor identified him as \u201cthe other guy\u201d referenced in Alston\u2019s confession. The Superior Court found merit to Appellee\u2019s claim, relying upon our theoretical expansion of the Bruton rule in Commonwealth v. Brown, 592 Pa. 376, 925 A.2d 147 (2007). In Brown, we stated that the Bruton rule may apply to circumstances where a prosecutor negates the redaction by announcing that \u201cthe other guy\u201d referenced in a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s statement is the defendant. The Superior Court found the instant case distinguishable from the facts of Brown, but analogous to the hypothetical extension of Bruton proposed therein. Cannon, sn/pra at 12. The Superior Court reasoned that the Bruton rule applied because the prosecutor\u2019s comment directly inculpated Appellee beyond the properly introduced evidence. Id.\nThe Superior Court further concluded that the cautionary instruction was insufficient to cure the prejudice caused by the prosecutor\u2019s remark. Id. at 12. The court opined that the prosecutor\u2019s comment, which occurred before the presentation of evidence, made it nearly impossible for the jury to disregard the remark and attribute the incriminating facts of Alston\u2019s statement solely to him. Id. Accordingly, the court vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded for a new trial.\nThe Commonwealth petitioned this Court for allowance of appeal, which we granted limited to the following issue:\nDid the Superior Court override controlling authority establishing that in a joint trial, where the Commonwealth properly redacted a co-defendant\u2019s statement and did not use it to directly establish [Appellee]\u2019s guilt, and where the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding that statement, the narrow exception to the presumption that a jury will follow its instructions established in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 [88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476] (1968), does not apply?\nThe Commonwealth argues that the Superior Court erred in finding that the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement violated Appellee\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause. It claims that the court ignored the presumption that a jury will follow instructions, opting to apply the narrow exception established in Bruton. The Commonwealth contends that the Superior Court erred in its application of the law because the per se Bruton rule is strictly limited to situations where the prosecution uses the un-redacted, facially incriminating statement of a non-testifying co-defendant to establish a defendant\u2019s guilt at a joint trial. The Commonwealth observes that the prejudice Bruton aims to eliminate can be avoided by redacting the non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s statement and providing a limiting instruction. See Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987) (holding that the Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession where the statement is redacted to eliminate any reference to the defendant and is accompanied by a limiting instruction). The Commonwealth contends that the Bruton rule does not encompass statements that are incriminatory by inference or when linked with other evidence introduced at trial. Richardson, 481 U.S. at 208, 107 S.Ct. 1702; Gray v. Maryland, 523 U.S. 185, 118 S.Ct. 1151, 140 L.Ed.2d 294 (1998).\nThe Commonwealth maintains that it properly redacted Alston\u2019s statement, thereby complying with the requirements of Bruton and its progeny. Furthermore, it notes that the trial court immediately gave a cautionary instruction, curing any possible harm caused by the prosecutor\u2019s statement. The Commonwealth avers that this was merely a case of \u201ccontextual implication,\u201d which falls outside the scope of Bruton. See Richardson, supra at 208-09,107 S.Ct. 1702.\nAccording to the Commonwealth, the Superior Court impermissibly extended the scope of Bruton based on a misinterpretation of our pronouncement in Brown. The Commonwealth maintains that the situation envisioned in Brmm, i.e., where a prosecutor negates the redaction, did not occur in the case sub judice. In support of this argument, the Commonwealth contends the prosecutor\u2019s statement properly indicated that evidence from \u201cother sources\u201d would prove that Appellee conspired with Alston. It observes that the \u201cobjectionable statement\u201d was preceded and followed by direct references to the other evidence establishing Appellee\u2019s guilt, namely the Everetts\u2019 statements. Thus, it is the Commonwealth\u2019s position that Alston\u2019s statement was never used against Appellee. The Commonwealth asserts that Appellee\u2019s argument to the contrary is untenable because the prosecutor expressly stated that Alston\u2019s confession could not be considered in assessing Appellee\u2019s guilt. Accordingly, the Commonwealth maintains that there was no Bruton violation, and any possible harm caused by the prosecutor\u2019s remark was cured by the cautionary instruction and general charge to the jury.\nAppellee counters that the prosecutor\u2019s comment implicated Bruton. Relying on the Superior Court\u2019s analysis, Appellee claims that the prosecutor negated the redaction by reading Alston\u2019s inculpatory statement and then unequivocally identifying Appellee as the \u201cthe other guy.\u201d Accordingly, Appellee claims that the instant case presents the type of scenario that we cautioned against in Brown.\nAppellee further contends that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to \u201cother sources\u201d as the basis for identifying Appellee is disingenuous. Appellee maintains that the prosecutor\u2019s remark did not focus on other evidence establishing that he was the gunman. Rather, Appellee argues that the focus was on Alston identifying him as the shooter. In this regard, Appellee observes that aside from Alston\u2019s statement, the evidence against him was purely circumstantial. Thus, he posits that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to \u201cother sources\u201d was a misrepresentation that fails to insulate the instant case from a Bruton violation.\nIn the case sub judice, we must assess the applicability of the Bruton rule to a situation involving prosecutor commentary. Accordingly, we are presented with a question of law for which our scope of review is plenary, and our standard of review is de novo. Brown, supra at 154-55.\nThe Confrontation Clause guarantees a criminal defendant the right to cross-examine witnesses. Richardson, 481 U.S. at 206, 107 S.Ct. 1702. Ordinarily, a witness whose testimony is introduced at a joint trial is not considered a witness \u201cagainst\u201d a defendant if the jury is instructed to consider the testimony only against a co-defendant. Id. This principle is in accord with the well-established presumption that jurors will abide by their instructions. Id.; Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 541 Pa. 108, 661 A.2d 352, 361 (1995). In Bruton, however, the United States Supreme Court recognized that \u201cthere are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.\u201d Bruton, 391 U.S. at 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620. Accordingly, \u201c[t]he Bruton Court held that, if a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession directly and powerfully implicates the defendant in the crime, then an instruction to the jury to consider the evidence only against the co-defendant is insufficient, essentially as a matter of law, to protect the defendant\u2019s confrontation rights.\u201d Brown, 925 A.2d at 157 (citing Bruton, 391 U.S. at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. 1620).\nThe United States Supreme Court examined the per se Bruton rule in Richardson, supra, and emphasized its narrow scope. Therein, the Court held that the \u201cConfrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession with a proper limiting instruction when ... the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant\u2019s name, but any reference to his or her existence.\u201d Richardson, 481 U.S. at 211, 107 S.Ct. 1702. Consistent with the High Court\u2019s pronouncement and our own line of cases, we have held that substituting the neutral phrase \u201cthe guy\u201d or \u201cthe other guy\u201d for the defendant\u2019s name is an appropriate redaction. See Commonwealth v. Travers, 564 Pa. 362, 768 A.2d 845, 851 (2001).\nIn Brown, this Court considered a scenario outside the traditional Bruton paradigm. The objectionable event in Brown was a non-evidentiary comment by counsel. During closing argument, the prosecutor referred to the defendant by his alias while discussing a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s redacted confession. Recognizing that the United States Supreme Court has not extended the reach of Bruton to comments by counsel, this Court observed that there might be an instance where remarks during an opening or closing statement could be so prejudicial that a finding of error would be unavoidable. Brown, 925 A.2d at 159. We explained:\nThere is no point in redacting and sanitizing otherwise inculpatory statements of a non-testifying co-defendant, to facilitate a joint trial, if that protective measure approved by the High Court to comport with the Confrontation Clause could be deliberately and directly undone by lawyer commentary. Consider, for example, if the redacted evidence would be powerfully incriminating if tied to the defendant, and the prosecutor were to say something along the lines of: \u201cYou heard the co-defendant\u2019s confession, which also described the actions of someone he identified only as \u2018the other guy;\u2019 well, I\u2019m here to tell you that \u2018the other guy\u2019 he was speaking of was the defendant and we just changed the wording of the statement.\u201d ... We have no doubt that, in an appropriate case, the High Court would approve application of the per se Bruton rule to an instance where the objection is to argument by counsel concerning Brutonredacted evidence.\nId. at 159-60. While not condoning the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement, we concluded that the circumstances were not so egregious as to implicate Bruton. Finally, we observed that the trial court\u2019s response to the objection, which consisted of a \u201cdirect, unequivocal, and strong\u201d cautionary instruction, was sufficient to cure any prejudice. Brown, 925 A.2d at 161. The Court recognized that the trial court is in the \u201cbest position\u201d to assess whether the misstatement is curable, thereby acknowledging the deference that must be accorded to the trial court\u2019s ruling. Id. at 160-61.\nThus, pursuant to Brown, a Bruton violation may arise when a prosecutor discloses to the jury that the co-defendant\u2019s statement has been redacted and unequivocally identifies the defendant as the individual whose name was removed. Contrary to Appellee\u2019s argument and the Superior Court\u2019s finding, the case sub judice does not implicate the Bruton rule. Simply stated, the facts of the hypothetical Bruton violation posited in Brown are distinguishable from the facts of the instant case. As such, the Superior Court\u2019s extension of the Bruton rule based on Brown was unwarranted.\nInitially, we observe that when making the \u201cobjectionable\u201d comment, the prosecutor did not use the precise language of the redaction. After reading Alston\u2019s redacted confession to the jury, the prosecutor stated, \u201cThe evidence will show through other sources, ladies and gentleman, the person who was with Mr. Alston was [Appellee].\u201d Thus, the prosecutor referenced \u201cthe person who was with\u201d Alston, not \u201cthe other guy.\u201d While a seemingly trivial difference, the lack of symmetry in the language attenuates the link between the comment and the redacted statement. It further distinguishes the instant case from Brown, where our hypothetical had the prosecutor mimicking the exact language of the redaction.\nMoreover, the prosecutor did not directly inculpate Appellee with Alston\u2019s statement. Significantly, the prosecutor stated that evidence from \u201cother sources\u201d would indicate that Appellee was the man who conspired with Alston. The prosecutor unequivocally told the jury that the confession could be used only against Alston, presented the evidence against Alston, and then transitioned to the admissible evidence against Appellee. Thus, the identification of Appellee was inculpatory by reference to evidence other than the redacted confession. Linking Appellee to the crime with other properly admitted evidence is not a violation of the Bruton rule; it is a permissible instance of contextual implication Richardson, supra at 208-09,107 S.Ct. 1702 (recognizing the distinction between co-defendant confessions that expressly incriminate and those that become incriminating when linked with properly introduced evidence). Since the prosecutor did not use Alston\u2019s statement to establish Appellee\u2019s guilt, he did not negate the redaction.\nWe emphasize the significance of the fact that the prosecutor, consistent with his proffer, identified the evidence from \u201cother sources\u201d that established Appellee\u2019s guilt. Immediately after making the comment, the prosecutor queried, \u201cHow do we know? We know from Dominique.\u201d N.T., 1/22/07, at 37. The prosecutor proceeded to explain that Dominique\u2019s statement placed Appellee at the scene and linked him to the gun, which ballistics evidence identified as the murder weapon. Furthermore, Dominique indicated that she overheard Appellee and Alston quarrelling about the shooting, a fact corroborated by Jamilla\u2019s statement. The prosecution presented the aforementioned evidence at trial, ultimately proving that Appellee was the shooter. Notably, the Superior Court recognized this fact, twice acknowledging that the evidence \u2014 absent the redacted confession \u2014 was sufficient to sustain the verdict. Cannon, supra at 3-4,12.\nThe Superior Court failed to appreciate the distinction between the prosecutor\u2019s comments in this case and the hypothetical posed in Brown. In our example in Brown, the prosecutor blatantly disclosed to the jury that the statement had been redacted and that the individual whose name had been removed was the defendant. By contrast, the prosecutor in the instant case referenced the other evidence detailing Appellee\u2019s involvement in the crime. His comment merely introduced the admissible evidence that the prosecution would present during its case-in-chief. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s remark was not the type of direct inculpation that Brown held could constitute a Bruton violation.\nAdditionally, the record reveals that the jury received numerous cautionary and explanatory instructions that were sufficient to cure any prejudice. At Appellee\u2019s request, the trial court issued a cautionary instruction following the prosecutor\u2019s comment. The court stated:\nJurors, just to be clear, I want to make sure you understand that, one, any reference by the Commonwealth to a statement by Mr. Alston, that statement can only be used against Mr. Alston and not anyone else. So that statement can only be used against Mr. Alston. I want to make sure that you are clear on that. And obviously as I indicated in my preliminary instructions to you, the arguments and the opening statements of counsel are not evidence. The evidence will come from the witness stand once the witnesses are placed under oath and that is the evidence that you can consider. This is what the Commonwealth hopes to prove in the course of this trial. But it is not evidence. No evidence has been received in this case.\nN.T., 1/22/07, at 49-50. In its final charge to the jury, the trial court stated:\nA statement made before a trial may be considered as evidence only against a defendant who made the statement ... You must not, however, consider the statement as evidence against anyone else. You may not use the statement in any way against anyone else. So to be clear, if you find that the statement was voluntary, you can only use it as evidence against Mr. Alston and no one else.\nId. at 766. The jury was further cautioned, \u201cThe speeches of counsel are not part of the evidence and you should not consider them as such.\u201d Id. at 768.\nThus, our review of the record indicates that the trial court gave \u201cdirect, unequivocal, and strong\u201d cautionary instructions, repeatedly detailing the proper manner of weighing the evidence. Brown, supra at 161. The trial court, which is in the best position to assess whether any prejudice can be cured, determined that the prosecutor\u2019s comment did not justify a mistrial. Id. In reaching a contrary result, the Superior Court failed to accord proper deference to the trial court, thereby disregarding our pronouncement in Brown.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the redaction combined with the trial court\u2019s accurate and repeated cautionary instructions sufficed to protect Appellee\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights. As such, we find no merit to the allegation that the prosecutor violated Bruton by identifying Appellee as \u201cthe other guy\u201d referenced in Alston\u2019s redacted confession. Stated differently, the prosecutor\u2019s comment did not corrupt or negate the otherwise proper redaction. The Superior Court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary was premised on a misreading of Broum. While we do not disavow our statement in Brown, we recognize that the facts upon which we proposed an expansion of the Bruton rule are distinguishable from the facts of the present case. Thus, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was not so egregious as to trigger the Bruton rule as envisioned in Brown.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed and the judgment of sentence is reinstated.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices EAKIN, TODD and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion in which Justices BAER and TODD join.\n. Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) (holding that where a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession directly and powerfully incriminates the defendant, an instruction to the jury to consider the evidence against only the co-defendant is insufficient to protect the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights).\n. The first and second floors of 2401 West Turner Street were unoccupied.\n. We note that Appellee did not lodge a Bruton-based objection to the adequacy of the redaction.\n. Alston was convicted of second-degree murder, robbery, and conspiracy.\n. \"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to ... be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI.\n. In this vein, the Commonwealth notes that the law does not prohibit a prosecutor from drawing attention to the inference that the jury can permissibly make.\n. In lieu of presenting independent argument and analysis, Appellee excerpted several pages from the Superior Court\u2019s opinion directly into his brief.\n. In reaching this conclusion, we noted that the prosecutor's comment only affected the redaction indirectly and by inference. Brown, 925 A.2d at 160. Additionally, the revelation of the defendant's alias concerned a point in time after the crime and, therefore, did not directly implicate him in the murder beyond the properly introduced evidence. Id.\n. In Brown we stated, \"You heard the co-defendant\u2019s confession, which also described the actions of someone he identified only as 'the other guy, \u2019 well, I'm here to tell you that 'the other guy \u2019 he was speaking of was the defendant and we just changed the wording of the statement.\u201d Id. at 159-60 (Emphasis added).\n. The Superior Court stressed the importance of the timing of the prosecutor\u2019s comment. The Superior Court reasoned that by making the comment before the presentation of evidence, the prosecutor improperly influenced the jury\u2019s ability to evaluate the evidence against Appellee without regard to Alston's statement. Since we find no Bruton violation, we do not address the allegation that the timing of the remark clouded the jury\u2019s ability to properly weigh the evidence."}
