L. 429, 431, as amended by Act of July 11, 1917, P. L. 755. An answer was filed which avers the petitioner \u201cis not legally entitled to his claim......for the reason that he has, for a period of nearly two years prior to the decease of the said Mary Alamenczak......wilfully neglected and refused to provide for her and did wilfully and maliciously desert her.\u201d The claim was allowed, and this appeal followed.\nSection 5 of the Act of June 7, 1917, supra, provides: \u201cNo husband who shall have, for one year or upwards previous to the death of his wife, wilfully neglected or refused to provide for his wife, or shall have for that period or upwards wilfully and maliciously deserted her, shall have the right to claim any title or interest in her real or personal estate after her decease, under the provisions of this act.\u201d\nThe court below concluded correctly that the evidence failed to show either a wilful neglect to provide for the wife or a wilful and malicious desertion of her by the petitioner; hence it did not err in allowing the relief sought: Phillips\u2019 Estate, 271 Pa. 129, 132.\nThe decree is affirmed; costs to be paid out of the estate."}
