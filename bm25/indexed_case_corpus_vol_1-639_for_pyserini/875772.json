{"id": "875772", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIt is unnecessary to cite authorities to show that the only question presented in this case was concluded by the final decree of this court in Clark\u2019s Appeal, 162 Pa. 435. The question of costs, including of course the master\u2019s fee now complained of, was directly involved in that case and must now be regarded as rem adjudicatam.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellants."}
