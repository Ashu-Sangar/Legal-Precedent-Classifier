{"id": "281296", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nWe must determine whether there is substantial evidence to support the termination of the claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The Commonwealth Court held that there is not. We reverse.\nAppellee, Susan Udvari, was employed as a lead flight attendant by Appellant, USAir Inc. On January 15, 1992, Udvari sustained neck and shoulder injuries when an aircraft in which she was working ran into a snow bank while attempting to depart. Pursuant to a notice of compensation payable, Udvari received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. On February 8, 1993, USAir filed a petition for termination, alleging that all disability associated with the work injury had ceased as of February 4, 1993. Udvari returned to work on May 1, 1993.\nFollowing several hearings where both parties presented expert medical testimony, the workers\u2019 compensation judge (WCJ) granted the termination petition. It credited the testimony of USAir\u2019s expert witness, Paul S. Lieber, M.D., who testified that as of February 3, 1993, Udvari had completely recovered from her work injury and no longer required treatment. On appeal, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board affirmed, finding that Dr. Lieber\u2019s testimony constituted substantial evidence to support the termination of benefits.\nThe Commonwealth Court reversed. 667 A.2d 433 (Pa. Cmwlth.1995). It noted that Dr. Lieber \u201cclearly, unequivocally and consistently testified that he diagnosed Udvari with chronic muscular strain and multiple contusions from the work injury, that these were completely resolved as of the time of his examination, that Udvari was completely healed and that there was no reason for \u2018any further medical, chiropractic, physical therapy or diagnostic tests.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 434 (citation omitted). However, the court held that because Dr. Lieber diagnosed Udvari with \u201csymptom magnification syndrome\u201d and testified regarding Udvari\u2019s continuing pain, the termination of benefits was improper. Instead, a suspension of benefits was appropriate because the WCJ credited Dr. Lieber\u2019s testimony that Udvari was able to return to work despite her residual pain and symptom magnification syndrome.\nThe scope of appellate review in a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding is limited to determining whether constitutional rights were violated, whether an error of law was committed, or whether the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. Gumro v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 533 Pa. 461, 626 A.2d 94 (1993). Substantial evidence has been defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d Bethenergy Mines, Inc., v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 531 Pa. 287, 292, 612 A.2d 434, 436 (1992). In order to terminate benefits, the employer must establish that all disability related to a compensable injury has ceased. Pieper v. Ametek-Thermox Instruments Division, 526 Pa. 25, 584 A.2d 301 (1990).\nUSAir contends that substantial evidence exists to grant a termination petition where there is expert medical testimony that the claimant is fully recovered and can return to work without restrictions and there are no objective findings supporting subjective complaints of pain. It argues that this is true even if the medical expert testifying on behalf of the employer acknowledges the claimant\u2019s pain. USAir relies on Shepherd v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 66 Pa. Cmwlth. 101, 443 A.2d 862 (1982) and its progeny.\nIn Shepherd, a hearing was held on the employer\u2019s termination petition wherein conflicting evidence was presented regarding the claimant\u2019s injury. The physician testifying on behalf of the employer stated that he was aware of the claimant\u2019s complaints of pain but that he believed the claimant was fully recovered and could work without restrictions. The referee credited this testimony and granted the termination petition.\nThe Commonwealth Court affirmed the termination of benefits and stated\nNeither Pennwalt, Stokes Division v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 44 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 98, 403 A.2d 186 (1979) nor Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board v. F.W. Woolworth Co., 19 Pa.Commonwealth Ct. 413, 338 A.2d 784 (1975) stand for the proposition advanced- by Shepard that the referee must find in favor of a claimant who complains of continued subjective symptoms even in the absence of medical evidence of an objective basis for his complaints. The question is factual and must rest with the factfinders. The cases cited simply state that the referee may consider in making his findings the claimant\u2019s subjective complaints as well as other medical evidence.\nId. 443 A.2d at 863-64.\nThe Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding in Shepherd has been followed in various termination cases. See Jenkins v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 677 A.2d 1288 (Pa. Cmwlth.1996) (termination proper where referee credited employer\u2019s medical expert who testified that he acknowledged claimant\u2019s complaints of pain but found no objective basis for them); Bloom v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Keystone Pretzel Bakery), 677 A.2d 1314 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996) (when credited medical expert testimony establishes no objective evidence of ongoing disability and claimant was fully recovered, termination proper despite claimant\u2019s contentions of continued pain); Kerns v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Colt Resources, Inc.), 149 Pa.Cmwlth. 268, 613 A.2d 85 (1992) (same); Allen v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (The Leathercraft Company), 150 Pa.Cmwlth. 302, 615 A.2d 927 (1992) (same); Corcoran v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Stuart Painting Company), 144 Pa.Cmwlth. 398, 601 A.2d 887 (1992) (same); Laird v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Michael Curran & Associates,), 137 Pa.Cmwlth. 206, 585 A.2d 602 (1991) (terxnination proper where referee accepted employer\u2019s expert medical testimony that claimant was totally recovered even though he had no reason to question the claimant\u2019s complaints of pain); Williams v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Montgomery Ward), 127 Pa.Cmwlth. 587, 562 A.2d 437 (1989) (mere reluctance by a physician to discount a claimant\u2019s unconfirmed subjective complaints is not tantamount to an implicit admission that claimant is not fully recovered).\nThe proposition relied on by the Commonwealth Court regarding the effect of a medical expert\u2019s acknowledgement of the claimant\u2019s pain seemingly arose in Rogers Motor Lines, Inc., v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Kenneth E. Baker), 144 Pa.Cmwlth. 493, 601 A.2d 934 (1992). In Rogers, the employer filed a termination petition, alleging that the claimant had fully recovered from his work-related disability. The referee found that the employer failed to sustain its burden of proof for a termination of benefits because it did not establish that the claimant\u2019s problems were a result of an injury other than the work-related injury. The Commonwealth Court affirmed, noting that the referee did not find that the claimant\u2019s disability had ceased. It further stated, \u201ceven Employer\u2019s doctor acknowledged that [Claimant] had continuing pain.\u201d Id. at 935.\nAlthough the holding in Rogers was that the employer failed to prove that the injury had ceased, subsequent cases have cited Rogers for the proposition that the \u201cfinding of full recovery would not be supported by substantial evidence if the medical expert testifying for the defendant acknowledged the existence of continued pain suffered by the claimant.\u201d McFaddin v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Monongahela Valley Hospital), 153 Pa.Cmwlth. 252, 620 A.2d 709, 711 (1993).\nIn Moltzen v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Rochester Manor), 166 Pa.Cmwlth. 589, 646 A.2d 748 (1994), the referee terminated the claimant\u2019s benefits on the ground that she was fully recovered. The referee credited the testimony of the employer\u2019s doctor who stated that he believed the claimant had continuing lower back pain, but that this pain was unrelated to her work injury. The Commonwealth Court reversed. Noting that credibility determinations are matters to be decided by the factfinder, the court accepted the referee\u2019s finding that the claimant\u2019s back pain was unrelated to her work iiyury. However, the court found that the employer\u2019s medical expert also testified that the claimant suffered from pain in her knee which was attributable to the physical therapy the claimant was undergoing for the work injury. The court concluded that because the knee pain was a result of the initial work injury, benefits should not have been terminated. The court cited McFaddin for the same proposition stated above regarding the improper termination of benefits when the employer\u2019s physician acknowledges the claimant\u2019s pain.\nIn these cases, the term \u201cacknowledge\u201d was used in the context of the employer\u2019s medical expert accepting the fact that the claimant suffered from pain, yet failing to opine that the pain was unrelated to the work injury. The term was not used to describe the medical expert\u2019s mere recognition that the claimant complained of pain. In each case, the factfinder evaluated the evidence and credited either the claimant\u2019s version of the facts or that of the employer.\nThe determination of whether a claimant\u2019s subjective complaints of pain are accepted is a question of fact for the WCJ. In the absence of objective medical testimony, the WCJ is neither required to accept the claimant\u2019s assertions, nor prohibited from doing so. Testimony by the employer\u2019s medical expert as to the existence of the claimant\u2019s complaints of pain does not require the WCJ to find for the claimant. A contrary conclusion would lead to the absurd result that a claimant could forever preclude the termination of benefits by merely complaining of continuing pain. What is relevant in deciding whether the termination of benefits is warranted is whether the claimant suffers from pain as a result of the work-related injury.\nWe must keep in mind that the employer bears the burden of proof in a termination proceeding to establish that the work injury has ceased. In a case where the claimant complains of continued pain, this burden is met when an employer\u2019s medical expert unequivocally testifies that it is his opinion, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that the claimant is fully recovered, can return to work without restrictions and that there are no objective medical findings which either substantiate the claims of pain or connect them to the work injury. If the WCJ credits this testimony, the termination of benefits is proper.\nContrary to the holding of the Commonwealth Court, we find that USAir met its burden of proof in the instant case. As noted, Dr. Lieber clearly and unequivocally testified that Udvari was completely healed and required no further treatment. The Commonwealth Court found the termination of benefits improper, however, based on the fact that Dr. Lieber diagnosed Udvari with \u201csymptom magnification syndrome\u201d and testified regarding her pain.\nReviewing Dr. Lieber\u2019s testimony in its entirety, it is clear that \u201csymptom magnification syndrome\u201d is not a separately diagnosed illness, but is rather a term used to describe Udvari\u2019s exaggeration of symptoms. Dr. Lieber testified that Udvari responded inconsistently to various physical tests and did not react as would be expected of an individual who suffered from the pain she described. He further testified that Udvari\u2019s behavior during the examination was abnormal. Dr. Lieber stated that Udvari appeared hostile and angry, exhibited rapid pressured speech and sobbed when he lightly palpated her skin.\nWhen asked to explain what he meant by the term \u201csymptom magnification syndrome,\u201d Dr. Lieber stated\nSymptom magnification syndrome can be a diagnosis that can be anything from malingering to psychogenic pain. There\u2019s a large continuum in between where people embellish their symptoms for a myriad of reasons.\nIn this case there were many nonphysiologic findings, which I describe during the course of my examination, which were inconsistent with what would be expected for normal routine examination.\nR. 81a. When asked what he meant by that, he responded\nThat there was no physiologic basis for the patient\u2019s pain and that there was no evidence that the patient was voluntarily or maliciously trying to deceive me or anybody else but was fully invested in these complaints without evidence that they were physiologically present.\nId.\nDr. Lieber later realized that Udvari\u2019s counsel was suggesting that symptom magnification syndrome was a distinct disorder. To clarify the misunderstanding Dr. Lieber stated\nI see what your point is. I think that what we\u2019re getting at is the fact that I thought this woman was a symptom magnifier and her pain complaints were subjectively based.\nI am not trying to describe it as a disease entity unto itself. I\u2019m not calling her\u2014 specifically making a statement that this woman has a chronic pain syndrome that is amenable to any specific treatment.\nThe point was that this person did not have pain for which there was any objective basis on my examination and that I couldn\u2019t find anything wrong with her. And so rather than not provide a diagnosis, I provided some diagnosis there.\nBut the treatment basically is to return to work so that she can get into a more functional existence because there\u2019s nothing that I could find that was physiologically abnormal.\nR. 106a (emphasis added).\nIt is clear from this testimony that symptom magnification syndrome is not a compensable disorder arising from the work-related injury.\nIt is equally clear that Dr. Lieber\u2019s reference to Udvari\u2019s pain does not preclude the termination of benefits. The Commonwealth Court relied upon the underlined portion of the following exchange between Dr. Lieber and Udvari\u2019s counsel.\nA. I think we\u2019ve gotten off track here, and if my making this diagnosis of symptom magnification syndrome has gotten us off track, then I have misrepresented myself in the diagnosis.\nAnd what I am trying to impart is, again, that she embellished her symptoms, for whatever reasons, I don\u2019t know; that I could find nothing wrong with this woman; that I thought she was fully recovered; and that she should return to work.\nQ. And you don\u2019t consider her to be a malingerer?\nA. A malingerer?\nQ. Yes.\nA. I\u2019m reluctant to call her a malingerer because I think that that attaches a certain stigma and that I am not convinced that she was lying to me.\nBasically there are some people who I am convinced are lying to me, but I\u2019m not convinced that she was lying to me. You know, in other words, what I\u2019m trying to say is she might believe that she has this pain. I\u2019m going to give her the benefit of the doubt in that regard.\nR. 107a-108a.\nThis fleeting reference does not establish that Udvari continued to experience pain as a result of the work-related injury. It merely suggests that Dr. Lieber was giving Udvari \u201cthe benefit of the doubt\u201d that she believed that she experienced some sort of pain. Dr. Lieber repeatedly testified that there was no objective basis for her complaints and that he believed the symptoms were exaggerated. Unlike the situation in Rogers, the factfinder here credited Dr. Lieber\u2019s clear and unequivocal testimony that the injury had ceased. This case is also distinguishable from Moltzen as there was no credited testimony establishing that any residual pain was attributable to the initial compensable injury. An appellate court cannot, by implication, decide that an expert\u2019s opinion was contrary to the opinion he directly and clearly stated. Laird v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 137 Pa. Cmwlth. 206, 585 A.2d 602, 604 (1991).\nAccordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is vacated and the order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board is reinstated.\nNEWMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nCAPPY, J., files a concurring opinion in which NIGRO, J., joins.\n. In his concurring opinion, Mr. Justice Cappy suggests that we have created two legal standards: one applicable where an employer's expert \"recognizes\u201d the claimant's complaints of pain and one applicable where an employer\u2019s expert \"attests to\u201d or \"supports\u201d the claimant\u2019s complaints of pain. He emphasizes that when an employer\u2019s medical expert acknowledges, attests to, or supports the existence of a claimant\u2019s ongoing pain, the expert must also opine that the pain is unrelated to the work injury for the employer to be successful in a termination proceeding. While we do not necessarily disagree with this particular proposition as applied in some circumstances, the statement needs clarification.\nThe fact that an employer's medical expert testifies that he believes that the claimant continues to suffer pain from a work injury does not automatically preclude the termination of benefits. Termination is only precluded when this testimony is credited by the WCJ. If the contrary were true, the physician would in effect become the factfinder. Credibility determinations are made solely by the WCJ, who has the authority to accept the testimony of a witness in whole or in part. Hartner v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board, 146 Pa.Cmwlth. 167, 604 A.2d 1204 (1992), alloc. denied, 531 Pa. 662, 613 A.2d 1210 (1992). The WCJ always has the option in any termination case to find that the testimony in support of continuing pain is incredible. If there is substantial evidence to support the WCJ's findings of fact that a particular claimant has fully recovered, can return to work without restrictions, and that there are no objective medical findings which either substantiate the claims of pain or connect them to the work injury, the termination of benefits is proper regardless of any evidence presented to the contrary.\n. It is well-established that a medical expert's failure to find an objective basis for a claimant\u2019s assertion of pain does not, by itself, establish that the claimant has fully recovered and that termination is warranted. JAB Enterprises v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Haehn), 79 Pa.Cmwlth. 638, 470 A.2d 210 (1984).\n. We emphasize that the failure of the employer\u2019s expert to employ these \u201cmagic words\u201d is not fatal to the employer's claim. Instead, the expert testimony must be reviewed in its entirety to determine whether the conclusions reached are sufficient to warrant termination of benefits. See Callahan v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Bethlehem Steel Corp.), 132 Pa.Cmwlth. 47, 571 A.2d 1108 (1990) (physician need not say magic words that claimant was \"fully recovered;\u201d sufficient that physician testified to releasing claimant to work without restrictions because work-related injury was resolved)."}
