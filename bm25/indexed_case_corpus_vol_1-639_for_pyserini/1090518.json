{"id": "1090518", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nPlaintiff, in this action to recover for personal injuries, relies on the Federal Safety Appliance Act of March 2, 1903, 32 Statutes at Large 913; the court below held that the act did not apply, and granted a compulsory nonsuit, which it later refused to take off; hence this appeal.\nDefendant, the Montour Railroad Company, is a Pennsylvania corporation possessing a single track railroad, \u201cfor the direct current of traffic,\u201d with necessary sidings ; its line, located wholly within this State, connects at one point with the Pittsburgh & Lake Erie Railroad, an interstate line. Defendant at times transports interstate goods, hut is engaged in such commerce only in th\u00e9 very limited sense that, occasionally, interstate shipments received from points outside the State of Pennsylvania are carried to places on its line, and such goods are at times received at points on its line for shipment to places outside the State. Defendant\u2019s railroad does not in any sense constitute a highway of interstate commerce, nor is it \u201cconnected with.\u201d (in the phraseology of the Federal Act) snch commerce in a way to make it in effect an interstate line; and plaintiff admits that at the time of the accident neither he nor defendant was actually engaged in (interstate commerce. In, pther words, defendant\u2019s line is not on the avenue of interstate commerce and cannot be accounted a link thereof; there is nothing in the evidence to show that cars belonging to defendant ever had left, or were likely to leave, its line for employment in such commerce; and, as to the train here involved, \u201cEvery car......was......empty...... without any load,\u201d and all had been received in that condition by defendant, at points within the State of Pennsylvania. Finally, during the course of the trial, counsel for plaintiff admitted that, even though some of these empty cars may have come from without the State, they, on the facts at bar, \u201cwould not have been [engaged in] interstate commerce so far as the Montour Railroad is concerned.\u201d In short, plaintiff, through his counsel, stated, \u201cI rely on the Safety Appliance Act,\u201d meaning that he claimed the right to recover on the theory that defendant\u2019s railroad was so \u201cconnected with interstate commerce\u201d as to bring its employees within the statute, whether or not they were actually engaged in such commerce at the time of injury.\nWe agree with the court below that the'facts proved do not bring plaintiff within the act relied on, and it did not err in denying a right to recover in the present action. As said by the court below, \u201cThe State of Pennsylvania has made ample provision for employees, who are injured in the course of their employment, in what is known as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act; to the tribunal .provided in that statute the plaintiff in this case has recourse, and, in our opinion, to it alone.\u201d\nThe order appealed from is affirmed."}
