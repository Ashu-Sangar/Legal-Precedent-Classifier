{"id": "1898546", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nUnder the terms of an inter vivos trust created by his mother on May 31, 1946, Theodore K. Gramm (testator), .was-given a general power of appointment of certain property of-his. mother.\n\u2022 Testator died January 15, '1961, and, by his-will, he exercised this power' of appointment in the following manner: \u201cSixth: All the rest, residue and remainder of my estate,. real, personal and mix.ed, including any estate over which I have power of appointment, having in mind particularly the power of appointment [herein specific'reference is made to the inter vivos.trust created by testator\u2019s-mother],- I give,\u2019devise and bequeath absohctely for life to my wife, Elizabeth M. Gramm, yyith full pouyer of .consumption of the entire principal estate if, in her judgment, her needs require the consumption of the principal.. In this connection I direct that any transfers or sales of securities which might be a part, of my estate, may be made by her as though she were the sole and absolute owner without the interference of or consent of anyone else mentioned in this Will, or without any liability on the part of any -transfer -agent for making such transfer at her sole request. If any principal should .remain at the time of the death of my wife, . . ., then I give, devise and bequeath any remaining principal to my sister, Ida G. Betelle, absolutely. [A gift over followed in the event the sister predeceased the wife and a statement was made of the testator\u2019s \u201cdesire\u201d that the wife create an agency account with a named bank to handle the investments of this portion of the estate]\u201d. (Emphasis supplied).\nAt the time of testator\u2019s death, the appointive property consisted of various securities carried at $34,846.93 by the Provident Tradesmen\u2019s Bank and Trust Co. (Provident), trustee under the inter vivos trust. In December, 1962 \u2014 at which time the securities had a market value of approximately $51,000 \u2014 -Elizabeth Gramm (testator\u2019s widow) requested and Provident turned over to her these securities. The widow then sold the securities and invested the proceeds in shares of Institutional Foundation Fund, a mutual fund.\nOn December 27, 1962, the widow executed a declaration of trust the principal of which trust consisted of the shares of the mutual fund purchased from the proceeds of the sales of the securities received under testator\u2019s will. Under this revocable trust, the widow, as trustee, held the mutual fund shares for the benefit of her two nieces and she was to use the income, in the exercise of her discretion, for the benefit of her two nieces during her life and, upon her death, the principal of the trust was to go to the two nieces.\nOn March 16, 1963, the widow died. After her death, the two nieces \u2014 who were not only the beneficiaries under the trust but also the personal representatives and beneficiaries under their aunt\u2019s will \u2014 distributed to themselves the principal of the trust fund which at the time consisted of 5,381.619 shares of the mutual fund.\nTestator\u2019s sister, Ida Betelle, the remainderman named under the Sixth paragraph of testator\u2019s will, petitioned the Orphans\u2019 Court of Delaware County for a citation upon the two nieces, in their representative capacity, to show cause why they should not file an account on behalf of their deceased aunt in her capacity as trustee under the testator\u2019s will. \u2022 The citation was issued, an answer was filed on behalf of the two nieces and the matter came on for hearing. After hearing, the court entered a decree directing that an account be filed of all assets held by the testator\u2019s widow at the time'-of her death which represented the proceeds of the sale of the assets obtained by her from Provident.\nAn account was filed wherein the nieces purported to account for the disputed assets in the following manner: \u201cTotal unconsumed assets held by [widow] 'as life tenant under the will of [testator] . . . \u20140\u2014\u201d. Testator\u2019s sister filed objections to this account, further hearings were held and the court sustained the objections and again directed the nieces to account for such assets. From that decree this appeal was taken.\nWhile ordinarily a decree directing the filing of an account is interlocutory and not ajjpealable (Eckfeldt's Appeal, 13 Pa. 171; Palethorp\u2019s Appeal, 160 Pa. 316, 317, 28 A. 689; Parmer\u2019s Estate, 237 Pa. 229, 85 A. 148), the instant decree which, in addition-to directing the filing of an account, directs the personal representatives to- charge themselves with certain specific assets is appealable : Williams\u2019 Estate, 338 Pa. 98, 102, 12 A. 2d 103; Crist\u2019s Estate, 106 Pa. Superior Ct. 571, 581, 162 A. 478.\n\" This appeal presents a question which involves a new twist to an oft-litigated problem: where personalty is given absolutely by a husband to his wife for her life together with the full- power of -consumption of the entire principal, if, in her judgment, \u201cher [the wife\u2019s] needs require\u201d it, with a gift over to another person \u201c[i]f any principal should remain at the time of th\u00e9 death of [the] wife\u201d, does the wife, in the exercise of her judgment, have' the right to create a trust, of which the principal is the personalty received from her husband, for the benefit of nieces of the-wife and to the exclusion of the remainderman named in -the will?\nIn this Commonwealth, limitations over after a gift of a life estate in personalty were early recognized, even without the intervention of a trustee, \u201cthough it- was always held that the life tenant was entitled to the possession of the thing so bequeathed, and this right carried with it the power to make his possession- valuable, according to circumstances.\u201d See also: Eichelberger v. Barnetz, 17 S. & R. 293, 294 (1828); Kinnard v. Kinnard, 5 Watts 108, 110 (1836); Holman\u2019s Appeal, 24 Pa. 174, 178, 179 (1854); Bregy, Intestate, Wills and Estates Acts of 1947, p. 5954 et seq.\n'By the enactment of legislation \u2014 Acts of February 24, 1834, P. L. 73, \u00a7\u00a746, 49, April 17, 1869, P. L. 70, May 17,1871, P. L. 269 and June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, \u00a723, 20 P.S. \u00a7635 \u2014 security was required to be given by the life tenant of personalty for the' protection of the remainderman. The case law which developed considered the relationship between the life tenant and the remainderman where personalty was given for limited period and with a gift over, without the intervention of or the creation of a trust, to be that of -debtor and creditor; the life tenant became a debtor to the remainderman in the amount originally received by the life tenant and the remainderman became a creditor of the life tenant or his estate for the value' of the personalty when received. Up until 1931 (Strawbridge\u2019s Estate, 14 Pa. D. & C. 703), the decisions all involved situations where the courts were determining the reiacionship between the life tenant and remainderman where the former' had entered s\u00e9curity or where the entry of security was expressly waived either by the provisions of the will or by agreement of the parties. However, in Strawbridge\u2019s Estate, supra, where the court was confronted with a situation where the life tenant had neither entered nor been excused from entering security, the late Judge Gest ruled that the rights of the life tenant and the remainderman were the same whether security was entered or not. See also.: Gillett\u2019s Estate, 130 Pa. Superior Ct. 309, 318-321.\nFinally, in Powell\u2019s Estate, 340 Pa. 404, 409-412, 17 A. 2d 391, this Court, reaffirming the existence of a debtor-creditor relationship between the life tenant and remainderman of personalty, held (a) the life tenant was responsible only for the value of the estate at the date of distribution and not for any increase of the value of the fund thereafter, (b) even though a life tenant posts no security, the life tenant remains a debtor to and not a. trustee for the remainderman and (c) legislation requiring a life, tenant of personalty to post security did not apply to a life tenant to whom had been given the power of consumption of principal.\nWhen the legislature enacted the Estates Act of 1947 (Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 100, \u00a713, 20 P.S. \u00a7301.13) it provided, inter alia: \u201cA. person having a present interest in personal property, or in the proceeds of the conversion of real estate, which is- not in trust, and which is subject to a future interest, shall be deemed to be a. trustee of such property,. and not. a debtor to the remainderman, with th\u00e9 ordinary' powers and duties of a trustee, except that he shall not be required to change the form of the investment to an investment authorized for Pennsylvania fiduciaries, nor .shall he be entitled to compensation as trustee . . . .\u201d The impact of this statutory provision is that: (1) since January 1, 1948 \u2014 -the effective date of this statute\u2014 legal future estates cannot be created in personalty and- all such estates are now treated as trusts with the life tenant, or another person appointed in his stead by the court, acting in the capacity of trustee; (2) the life tenant is now subjected to all the rights and duties of a trustee, except as provided otherwise by the statute; (3) the life tenant or his estate must account for the value of the estate coming into his possession together with any increase in value during the period of the trust. This statute, with its drastic change in this area of the law, controls the instant proceedings. ' The widow, upon testator\u2019s death, became a trustee of that Avhich she received for the benefit of the remainder-man-sister of the testator.\nAn examination of the testator\u2019s will clearly reveals that testator\u2019s widow was given a life estate with full power of consumption of the entire principal estate and that she was given the authority to consume the principal even to exhaustion.. However, the testator unequivocally placed a restriction and limitation upon the widow\u2019s consumption of the principal when he provided that such consumption should take place only, if the widow, in her judgment, deemed that \u201cher needs\u201d required such consumption, i.e., the consumption of the principal, was to' be measured by the widow\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d. That the testator gave his widow vast powers over' the principal, restricted only by the exercise of such powers for her own \u201cneeds\u201d and in good faith, is clear not only under the language of the will but also under our case law: Dickinson\u2019s Estate, 209 Pa. 59, 58 A. 120; Keown\u2019s Estate, 238 Pa. 343, 86 A. 270; Fassitt v. Seip, 240 Pa. 406, 87 A. 957; Rumsey\u2019s Estate, 287 Pa. 448, 135 A. 119; Seigworth\u2019s Estate, 61 Pa. Superior Ct. 235; Zumbro v. Zumbro, 69 Pa. Superior Ct. 600; Fidelity T. & T. Co. v. Nibozin, 88 Pa. Superior Ct. 113. However, the intent of this testator to place a definite restriction on the consumption of principal is emphasized by the fact that testator contemplated the possibility that the principal might not be exhausted to meet the widow\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d since he provided a gift over \u201c[i]f any principal should remain at the time of the death of the [widow]\u201d.\nTestator\u2019s widow, after testator\u2019s death, went to Provident which held the securities under the inter vivos trust and requested delivery to her of such securities; upon their receipt, she sold them and with the proceeds purchased new securities for the disposition of which she created a trust. Such facts are not controlling; it would be \u201ca novel proposition that a life tenant can make herself owner in fee by asserting she is such\u201d: Rumsey\u2019s Estate, 287 Pa. 448, 453, 135 A. 119.\nWe recognize that, as a general rule, courts will not interfere with the first taker\u2019s control of the personal property unless the remainderman makes out a strong case requiring interference (Richey\u2019s Estate, 251 Pa. 324, 96 A. 748; Mercur's Estate, 151 Pa. 49, 24 A. 1094; Zumbro v. Zumbro, 69 Pa. Superior Ct. 600, 603) and that the amount required by the widow for her \u201cneeds\u201d rests entirely upon the exercise of her own judgment, the exercise of which cannot be limited or controlled by the courts in the absence of fraud or bad faith (Henninger v. Henninger, 202 Pa. 207, 51 A. 749; Tyson\u2019s Estate, 191 Pa. 218, 43 A. 131; Yetzer v. Brisse, 190 Pa. 346, 42 A. 677; Lininger's Appeal, 110 Pa. 398, 1 A. 722.)\n. However, the actions of the life tenant \u2014 widow in the case at bar \u2014 were such as to command judicial interference that the clearly expressed intent of the testator be not completely thwarted. The proceeds of -the gift made under the will were taken by the life tenant \u2014 widow and, literally, given away to her own kindred. The will clearly shows the testamentary design of the testator; the property disposed of in the Sixth paragraph of the will which is-the subject of this litigation was the property- of testator\u2019s mother over which she had given testator the power of disposition; in making such disposition, the primary object of testator\u2019s bounty was his wife and to her he gave this, property in such manner that she was-to have not only the income therefrom but even the principal if she needed it and she was to be the judge as to whether she needed to consume the principal, in whole or in part; however, ij she did not need to consume the principal,, in whole, or in part, he then provided that whatever remained of' the principal when she died should be given to his sister, the only relative having a common blood line with the original owner of this property. Despite this clearly expressed design of the testator, the life tenant-widow sought to change the testamentary plan and, through the medium of a trust, to dispose of the property to her own blood relatives to the exclusion of testator\u2019s blood relative specifically designated by testator as the second taker of the. property. The record portrays ail attempt on the part of the life tenant-, widow to divert this property to a purpose other than that provided by the will, a diversion which cannot be countenanced.\nIn Tyson\u2019s Estate, 191 Pa. 218, 226, 227, 228, 229, 43 A. 131, this Court said: \u201c. . . [testator\u2019s] intention was to give [his wife] so much, and only so much, though possibly amounting to the whole, as should be necessary for her own comfort and enjoyment of life, and the residue, be it much or little, was' to pass-under his will. This disposition of his estate violated no rule of law. . . . But, the purpose being clear and lawful, it is the duty of courts to see that it is carried out and not defeated for mere inconvenience of form. The extent of the widow\u2019s\u2019 consumption of the estate was within her control. Her decision was without appeal, but it must have been honestly reached in accordance with the purpose the testator intended, and not merely color-ably to defeat his will. She had power to carry out his intentions by sale, transfer and consumption of the proceeds in such a way as to leave nothing at her death. But a transfer with intent not to consume for herself,' but to preserve for others after her death, and to change the beneficiaries after her from those chosen by her husband to others of her own selection would be a fraud on the testator and his will. . . . The test in all such cases is the good faith of the action of the beneficiary. If it is an honest exercise of the discretion with which the testator has clothed him his action is conclusive, but he cannot be permitted to make use of the mere form to\u2019 defeat or evade the true intent and pervert the gift to a different purpose.\u201d See also: Johnson Estate, 359 Pa. 645, 650, 59 A. 2d 877.\nBy operation of law, this life tenant-widow occupied the status of a fiduciary with respect to the property bequeathed'; her diversion of such property to a purpose other than that provided by the testator\u2019s will' was a breach of her fiduciary duties, a breach which the courts must not overlook.-:\nThe nieces as the personal representatives of the life tenant-widow\u2019s estate must render an accounting: Such accounting- must \u00e1ccount for the value of the property at the time the securities were delivered to the life- ten-ant-widow together with any income payable to the nieces from the time of such delivery and any accretion in value from the time of the receipt by the life tenant-widow of these securities until the time of her death.\nDecree affirmed. Appellants to pay costs.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents.\nSee: Strawbridge\u2019s Estate, 14 Pa. D. & C. 703, 704, 705 wherein is contained an excellent discussion of the general subject by Judge Gest.\nReiff's Appeal, 124 Pa. 145, 149, 16 A. 636; Letterle\u2019s Estate, 248 Pa. 95, 97, 98, 93 A. 935; Kirkpatrick's Estate, 284 Pa. 583. 586, 587, 131 A. 361.\nIn the case at bar, no security had been posted nor had the posting of such security been waived.\nThe only case, which our research discloses, which takes the position that a bequest for life of personalty with power to consume ' did' not; in all instances, create a debtor and creditor relationship between the life tenant and the remainderman is Lyman Estate, 366 Pa. 164, 76 A. 2d 633. Lyman, however, can be distinguished on the ground that the majority of the court found that the testator had intended that the debtor-creditor relationship should not be applied.\nOf course, any depreciation in the value of the securities would be borne by the remainderman: Lyman Estate, supra."}
