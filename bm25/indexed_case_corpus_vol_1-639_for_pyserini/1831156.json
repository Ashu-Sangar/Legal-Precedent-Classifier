{"id": "1831156", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPAPADAKOS , Justice.\nAppellant was found guilty of murder in the first degree. Following a separate sentencing proceeding pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711, he was sentenced to death. We find no error in the proceeding and affirm the judgment of sentence.\nThe critical facts and procedural history indicate that in September, 1982, three actors, James Lambert, Bruce Reese and Bernard Jackson, agreed to rob Prince\u2019s Lounge in Philadelphia. As later testimony established, Reese and Jackson earlier had combined forces to undertake previous bar robberies, while Lambert was a newcomer on this particular occasion. Reese furnished two handguns to be wielded by himself and Lambert in this robbery. Upon arriving at the scene of the crime, Reese and Appellant Lambert proceeded inside while Jackson waited on the street with the car in preparation for the escape. Reese remained poised by the exit stairs, but Lambert went to the bar where he thrust a bag at a barmaid, Janet Ryan, who dashed into the ladies room. Lambert then ordered a second barmaid, Sarah Clark, to open the cash register and handed her a bag. According to Clark\u2019s testimony, she then heard two gunshots at that moment and saw one patron slump over the killer and fall to the floor. (T.T., April 11, 1984, pp. 92-93.) Two patrons had been shot to death by the Appellant. Both victims were killed by one actor. The evidence is clear that the actor with the bag was the shooter.\nThe three men then sped away in the car driven by Jackson. Jackson was arrested on an unrelated crime two weeks later. At that time, he told the police about the robbery of Prince\u2019s Lounge and identified the perpetrators and stated that Lambert, then known to him as \u201cMonk\u201d or simply \u201cdude,\u201d told him in the getaway car that he (Lambert) had just killed two men inside. Jackson repeated this statement during his testimony at trial. (T.T., April 13, 1984, pp. 116, 119.)\nLambert and Reese also were arrested and charged with murder, robbery, criminal conspiracy, and weapons offenses. At the preliminary hearing, witness Ryan did not appear because she could neither describe the actors nor identify them from photo arrays. There and at the suppression hearing as well, the Commonwealth informed the defense that Jackson alone was the only witness who could identify the two other defendants.\nLambert and Reese were tried together in a jury trial despite the former\u2019s motion for severance. Witness Ryan testified on two separate occasions. In her first appearance, she stated that she was unable to identify the actors. (T.T., April 11,1984, pp. 128-129.) After she stepped down, she approached the prosecutor outside of the courtroom to reveal that, while on the stand, she came to recognize Lambert as the person who had put the gun to her head. (T.T., April 11, 1984, p. 140.) The Commonwealth then sought to recall her over Lambert\u2019s objections that her proferred testimony be subjected first to a suppression hearing. The court refused to allow her to be recalled by the Commonwealth. (T.T., April 11, 1984, p. 148).\nAfter the Commonwealth rested, Reese initiated his defense by seeking to call Janet Ryan as his first witness. Lambert\u2019s counsel again objected on two grounds: first, that Ryan had been unable to make any prior identification of the person who had approached her; and, second, that the prosecution should not be given an opportunity to cross-examine her. The trial court ruled against both objections: \u201cit\u2019s a different situation ... I felt I couldn\u2019t stand in the way of the defendants who has [sic] testimony that was not brought out before. I think there are 2 different situations.\u201d (T.T., April 19,1984, pp. 6, 84.) In his opinion (at p. 11), Judge John A. Geisz reiterated his position that \u201cit is a different situation when the District Attorney is allowed to cross examine any witness called as a defense witness. In this part of the case, the adversary system had switched from a Commonwealth v. Defense into a Reese v. Lambert contest.\u201d\nOn direct examination by Reese\u2019s counsel, Ryan then denied that Reese was the person with the bag but followed with a positive in-court identification of Lambert as the actor who had approached her. On cross-examination by the prosecutor, she identified Lambert further from his facial features. (T.T., April 19, 1984, pp. 46, 71-72.)\nEach co-defendant denied during the trial that he was the shooter. As a result, the trial proceeded with a great deal of fingerpointing and evidence concerning the height, weight, and facial features of the killer. No other witness in the bar, excepting Ryan\u2019s later recollection, and Jackson\u2019s statement, was able to identify the actors.\nThe jury found Lambert guilty of two counts of murder in the first degree, robbery, conspiracy and related offenses on April 25, 1984. The sentencing jury found three aggravating circumstances and one mitigating circumstance. He was sentenced to death for the murders and concurrent jail sentences of five to ten years and ten to twenty years for the other crimes. Reese was found guilty of two counts of felony murder, robbery, and conspiracy and was sentenced to life imprisonment.\nSometime after the trial, Lambert\u2019s attorney interviewed Commonwealth witness and co-conspirator, Bernard Jackson, at his request. Jackson purportedly signed an affidavit which stated that Reese had been the killer and that Janet Ryan was a friend of the Reese family and would never testify adversely against him. In December, 1985, counsel requested an evidentiary hearing on after-discovered evidence. Judge Geisz rejected the motion in February, 1986, it appearing that the motion was not promptly filed and the attached affidavits were not properly executed, all in violation of Pa.R.C.P. 1123(d), Post-Verdict Motions:\n(d) A motion for a new trial on the ground of after-discovered evidence must be filed in writing promptly after such discovery. If an appeal is pending, the court may grant such motion only upon remand of the case.\nI. Severance\nAppellant alleges abuse and resulting prejudice by the trial court in refusing to grant severance. He advances several arguments to substantiate his conclusion that severance was warranted before and during trial. First, he contends in a general fashion that because he faced a death-qualified jury which was conviction-prone in his estimation, the court should have understood that the possible defenses which might be presented by the two defendants would be adversarial and antagonistic. Without fleshing in his argument with concrete evidence of irreconcilable defenses at the preliminary hearing, his request for separate trials was rejected as being unsubstantiated.\nHis second argument is that at trial he was not permitted to cross-examine witness Bernard Jackson for the purpose of eliciting information that Jackson and Reese had committed a series of past robberies together. Such information, he alleges, would have sustained his insistence that he was not the killer in the instant case because neither Jackson nor Reese would have entrusted the important task of carrying a gun to him as a newcomer who had known them for just a few hours before the robbery. The obvious aim of Appellant\u2019s strategy was to point the finger at his co-defendant, while exculpating himself on the grounds that, based on the Jackson-Reese robberies, it was more likely that Reese did the shooting.\nJackson\u2019s admission to the police that he and Reese previously had committed a string of robberies was made on October 22, 1982. At trial, Jackson was permitted to testify to these prior acts, but the court forbade him to make any references to Reese. (T.T., April 12, 1984, pp. 115ff.) The same prohibition applied to Appellant\u2019s cross-examination. In denying an opportunity to implicate Reese in the past robberies before the jury, the court concluded that the aggregate facts of those crimes do not satisfy the standard of \u201csignature crimes\u201d which reveal a unique modus operandi. Without proof of a common scheme, plan, or design, the trial court held that evidence of crimes other than that for which the accused is being tried is inherently prejudicial and inadmissible. Reese was being tried on the present charges; evidence of other crimes would have amounted to proof that he was a \u201cbad man.\u201d\nThird, Appellant forcefully urges us to justify severance based on the fact that Janet Ryan was permitted to be called by the Reese defense to identify him (Lambert) as the person who confronted her in the bar after she had been unable to do so as a Commonwealth witness. The procedure was unfair to him, he alleges, because he was not given an in-camera suppression hearing prior to her taking the stand as Reese\u2019s witness and because he had no warning prior to trial that she could identify him.\nWe conclude that Appellant was not entitled to severance on any of the theories which he advances in this appeal. Separate trials of co-defendants should be granted only where the defenses of each are antagonistic to the point where such individual differences are irreconcilable and a joint trial would result in prejudice. This determination is left to the discretion of the court which balances the inconvenience and expense to the government of separate trials against prejudice to the defendants in a joint trial, and the burden is on the movant to show prejudice. Prejudice, moreover, should be real, not fanciful, and must be considered together with the desirability of joint trials. Mere inconsistency in defenses is insufficient to denote potential prejudice. The evidence, on the contrary, must be of such a nature and quality that while it will be introduced against one defendant, it will not be admissible against others. Where the jury will infer justifiably that the conflict alone demonstrates that both are guilty, separate trials should be provided by the court. Commonwealth v. Jackson, 451 Pa. 462, 303 A.2d 924 (1973); Commonwealth v. Kloiber, 378 Pa. 412, 106 A.2d 820 (1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 875, 75 S.Ct. 112, 99 L.Ed. 688 (1954).\nOur standard on this subject was enunciated in Commonwealth v. Tolassi, 489 Pa. 41, 49, 413 A.2d 1003, 1007 (1980):\nThe decision whether to sever cases against co-defendant is one within the sound discretion of the trial court. Commonwealth v. Kloiber, 378 Pa. 412, 106 A.2d 820 (1954), cert. denied, 348 U.S. 875, 75 S.Ct. 112[, 99 L.Ed. 688] (1954); Pa.R.Crim.P. 219. Such a decision will be reversed only where there has been a manifest abuse of that discretion. Commonwealth v. Lasch, 464 Pa. 573, 347 A.2d 690 (1975) (opinion -in support of affirmance); Commonwealth v. Patrick, 416 Pa. 437, 206 A.2d 295 (1965), appeal after remand 424 Pa. 380, 227 A.2d 849 (1967). And the critical factor in one analysis is the prejudice which inures to the accused as a result of the trial court\u2019s determination. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 453 Pa. 187, 194, 307 A.2d [264], 267 (1973); Commonwealth v. Lasch, supra, 464 Pa. at 584-585[, 347 A.2d 690].\nSee also, Commonwealth v. Chestnut, 511 Pa. 169, 512 A.2d 603 (1986); Commonwealth v. Morales, 508 Pa. 51, 61, 494 A.2d 367, 372 (1985); and Commonwealth v. Iacino, 490 Pa. 119, 415 A.2d 61 (1980). Our most recent reaffirmance of this rule is Commonwealth v. Patterson, 519 Pa. 190, 546 A.2d 596 (1988).\nMere fingerpointing alone \u2014 the effort to exculpate oneself by inculpating another \u2014 is insufficient to warrant a separate trial. This particular rule is bracketed by one of our most ancient decisions, Commonwealth v. Place, 153 Pa. 314, 26 A. 620 (1893) (fingerpointing actually lightens the burden on the prosecution), and our most recent, Patterson, 519 Pa. at 197-198, 546 A.2d at 599-600. In the absence of manifest prejudice where the movant is unable to demonstrate the existence of antagonistic or irreconcilable defenses, therefore, our law does not approve of separate trials. On the contrary, the general policy of the law is to encourage joint trials in order to avoid the expense of duplicating evidence in a separate proceeding. Patterson, 519 Pa. at 198, 546 A.2d at 600.\nInterpreting these rules, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant severance in the case under review here. Appellant\u2019s first contention that he was in a hostile posture ab initio towards Reese is totally unsubstantiated. They were charged with the same crimes and with the same evidence, both of which stemmed from the same criminal transaction.\nHis second assignment of error that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s order prohibiting references to co-defendant Reese in Jackson\u2019s statement to the police on October 22, 1982, is equally faulty as mere fingerpointing. The testimony involving other crimes against Reese would be admissible only where they were of the \u201csame class as the one for which the defendant is being tried ... there must be such a high correlation in the details of the crimes that proof that the defendant committed one makes it very unlikely that anyone else but the defendant committed the others.\u201d Commonwealth v. Morris, 493 Pa. 164, 175, 425 A.2d 715, 720 (1981), relying on Commonwealth v. Fortune, 464 Pa. 367, 373, 346 A.2d 783, 786 (1975).\nThat \u201chigh correlation\u201d is missing here. The string of robberies forming the basis of Jackson\u2019s statement to the police and to the court, in reality is a hodgepodge of conflicting facts. Some were committed by Reese alone; some by Jackson alone; some by Jackson and Reese with third parties; some by Jackson and Reese where the former merely drove the escape vehicle; and some, indeed, by the two same actors. The list cannot be characterized as \u201csignature crimes.\u201d In barring their use against Reese here, the court rightly noted that the evidence would be prohibited as \u201cbad man\u201d accusations even in a separate trial as well.\nJanet Ryan\u2019s in-court identification of Appellant when she appeared as Reese\u2019s defense witness likewise was admissible and did not foist unfairness on Appellant\u2019s case. The complaint by Lambert\u2019s counsel that he was not afforded a pre-trial line-up opportunity with Ryan obviously fails because there were no identification witnesses, excluding Jackson, at that stage of the proceeding. When she was called as a defense witness for Reese, Appellant\u2019s counsel objected (T.T., April 19, 1984, pp. 3-5) but moved for a mistrial only after she identified Lambert from the stand. In-court identification, following a prior inability to target a defendant, is clearly admissible, while the weight of that evidence is to be judged by the jury. Commonwealth v. Silver, 499 Pa. 228, 237, 452 A.2d 1328, 1332 (1982), and cases cited therein. We add the obvious fact that in a separate proceeding against Appellant, Ryan\u2019s testimony would have been admitted in any event. Our rules against duplicative testimony speak effectively to this allegation.\nII. Bernard Jackson\u2019s Statement\nAs noted above, Jackson told police, and so testified at trial, that during the escape in the car, Reese stated to him that Lambert had killed two persons during the crime. Jackson\u2019s statement was: v\nToi and the dude got out of the car. I stayed in the car. About 4 minutes later the dude and Tou came running around the corner and jumped into the car. Touche get into the front with me and the dude got in the back. They told me to drive off. So I pulled off driving south towards Baltimore Avenue____ As we were going the dude in the back said he had shot somebody. He said he shot 2 people. I said, what for? He said one of the men jumped up at him and he shot him and the other guy tried to help, so he said he shot him, too. I drove right back out to Darby, the girl\u2019s house. (T.T., April 13, 1984, p. 116. \u201cDude\u201d refers to Appellant Lambert.)\nAppellant challenges the admissibility of the evidence as being hearsay, as falling outside of the recognized co-conspirator\u2019s exception to the hearsay rule because it was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy, and as a violation of Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968).\nBecause Reese\u2019s statement was part of the conspiracy dealing with flight from the scene, it falls within the exception. We decided in Commonwealth v. Coccioletti, 493 Pa. 103, 111, 425 A.2d 387, 391 (1981): \u201cA well-established exception to the hearsay rule permits the out-of-court declarations of one co-conspirator to be admitted against another co-conspirator provided that the declarations were made during the conspiracy and in furtherance of the common design.\u201d Conspirators are \u201cagents\u201d of the conspiracy.\nFor similar reasons, the Bruton rule does not apply to these facts. Bruton holds that at a joint trial the admission into evidence of a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession which inculpated the other co-defendant being jointly tried with the declarant, violated the other co-defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him, and further that this encroachment on the other co-defendant\u2019s constitutional right could not be cured by the formerly approved practice of having the trial judge instruct the jury to disregard the confession or statement in determining the innocence or guilt of every co-defendant except the confessor himself. Under Coccioletti, of course, inculpatory statements made by co-conspirators in their own presence following a crime have a strong indicia of spontaneity and reliability so as to comport with confrontation requirements. We also emphasize the fact that Appellant\u2019s counsel undertook a thorough cross-examination of Jackson on the witness chair. No violation of the Bruton rule occurred here.\nIII. Death Qualified Jury\nAppellant challenges his conviction on grounds that the trial court allegedly erred in permitting prospective jurors to be \u201cdeath qualified.\u201d During jury selection, the prosecution challenged for cause several prospective jurors who expressed an unalterable opposition to the death penalty. Appellant contends that this practice violates his right to an impartial jury under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Our court repeatedly has struck down this challenge. Commonwealth v. Aulisio, 514 Pa. 84, 522 A.2d 1075 (1987); Commonwealth v. Smith, 511 Pa. 343, 513 A.2d 1371 (1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 951, 107 S.Ct. 1617, 94 L.Ed.2d 801 (1987), construing Lockhart v. McCree, 476 U.S. 162, 106 S.Ct. 1758, 90 L.Ed.2d 137 (1986), which holds that the \u201cdeath qualification\u201d process is consistent with guarantees of a fair trial.\nIV. The Constitutionality of the Death Penalty Statute\nAppellant\u2019s following argument is that the death penalty statute, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711, is unconstitutional because it allegedly imposes no standards by which the jury can weigh aggravating versus mitigating circumstances. In repeated reviews of this subject, we have concluded that the statute passes constitutional muster. Our main concern, of course, is to avoid the risk that the verdict represents the result of arbitrariness by the jury. Commonwealth v. DeHart, 512 Pa. 235, 516 A.2d 656 (1986). Flexibility in this process, nevertheless, does not amount to unbridled discretion, even though a degree of \u201cimperfection\u201d is unavoidable. We held in Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 58, 454 A.2d 937, 959 (1982):\nPreliminarily, we must reiterate that perfection is not required, nor is it possible \u2014 there is no perfect procedure for deciding in which cases governmental authority should be used to impose a sentence of death. Lockett v. Ohio, supra [438 U.S. 586] at 605, 98 S.Ct. [2954] at 2965 [57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) ]. The requirement that the jury must be allowed to consider \u201cwhatever mitigating evidence relevant to his character and evidence the defendant can present,\u201d Commonwealth v. Moody, supra 476 Pa. [223] at 237, 382 A.2d [442] at 449 [1977], mandates that a certain amount of flexibility be built into any capital punishment sentencing structure, and moreover, virtually assures some \u201cimperfection\u201d in sentencing. Yet the requisite degree of flexibility is compatible with the federal and state constitutions if procedures exist which serve to focus the jury\u2019s attention on the particularized nature of the crime and the particularized characteristics of the offender, thus channeling the jury\u2019s discretion in order to ensure that, with the assistance of appellate scrutiny, the death sentence has not been imposed in an arbitrary and capricious manner. Gregg v. Georgia, supra 428 U.S. [153] at 206-07, 96 S.Ct. [2909] at 2940-2941 [49 L.Ed.2d 859 (1976) ] (Stewart, J., Opinion announcing the judgment of the Court); Lockett v. Ohio, supra 438 U.S. at 601, 98 S.Ct. at 2963 (it is not required that all sentencing discretion be eliminated, but only that it be directed and limited so that the death penalty will be imposed in a more consistent and rational manner and so that there will exist a meaningful basis for distinguishing the case in which it is imposed from those in which it is not.)\nAdditionally, we point out that the jury was instructed in the strictest terms to perform the weighing process with all due caution and deliberation.\nV. Definition of the Burden of Proof for Sentencing\nAt the sentencing stage, the court correctly instructed the jury that aggravating circumstances must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, while mitigating circumstances take the standard of preponderance of evidence. In defining preponderance of the evidence, however, the court used the phrase \u201cless of a margin than by reasonable doubt.\u201d (T.T., April 25, 1984, p. 34.) Appellant now seizes upon the use of the word \u201cmargin\u201d to conclude that the jury, therefore, had no standard by which to decide whether to impose the death sentence or life imprisonment. In effect, he insists that the use of the word \u201cmargin\u201d confused the jury and thereby prejudiced him.\nOur cases have held that an appellate evaluation of a jury charge rests on an examination of the entire statement in determining whether it is fair or prejudicial. Commonwealth v. Ohle, 503 Pa. 566, 470 A.2d 61 (1983), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1083, 106 S.Ct. 854, 88 L.Ed.2d 894 (1986); Commonwealth v. Wortham, 471 Pa. 243, 369 A.2d 1287 (1977). We fail to see, and Appellant offers no argument on this point, how the court\u2019s definition could have confused the jury on any common-sense basis. In spite of the Appellant\u2019s express refusal to offer evidence of any mitigating circumstances, in any event, the jury did find that he had no significant history of prior convictions. In light of this fact, it cannot be concluded that the Appellant was prejudiced, and no relief can be obtained here.\nVI. Racial Bias in Jury Selection\nIn this allegation, Appellant complains that the prosecution employed peremptory challenges on a racial basis in order to achieve a jury of eight white persons in violation of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986), which outlaws \u201cpurposeful discrimination\u201d in jury selection. See, also, Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, 521 Pa. 188, 555 A.2d 846 (1989).\nAppellant\u2019s brief, pp. 28-29, is utterly devoid of any specifics whatsoever offered to prove the allegation. Judge Geisz, slip opinion, p. 25, concluded that the \u201cdefense has again failed to specify the exact number of illegal challenges alleged to have been made by the prosecutor, nor has he cited any place in the record in support of such unproven allegations. On the other hand, this trial judge has searched the record and there is nothing on the record to indicate that any juror was of any specific race, the defendant never made any request of the court to record the race or racial appearance of any juror.\u201d We agree that no basis exists for this assignment of error.\nVII. Exclusion of Jurors on Religious Grounds\nThe trial judge posed the following question to each prospective juror: \u201cDo you have any religious or moral beliefs which would prevent you from voting for the death penalty in a proper case.\u201d (Slip opinion, p. 26.) Appellant contends that jurors were excluded because of religious beliefs which would not permit them to find the death penalty in contravention of Article 1, \u00a7 4 of the state constitution, mandating that no person may be disqualified from holding \u201cany office or place of trust\u201d solely \u201con account of his religious sentiments.\u201d Since jury duty constitutes an \u201coffice or place of trust,\u201d refusal to seat a prospective juror who answered the question affirmatively violates our constitution.\nThe argument is without merit and was recently rejected in Commonwealth v. Lewis, 523 Pa. 466, 567 A.2d 1376 (1989). In addition to the fact that the challenge was not raised at the voir dire, jurors were disqualified because of their absolute opposition to the death penalty. The source of that opposition \u2014 religious, moral or otherwise \u2014 is irrelevant to the law.\nVIII. Definition of \u201cKnowingly\u201d in the Statute\nUnder 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(7), the aggravated circumstance is defined as:\nIn the commission of the offense the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim of the offense.\nAppellant asserts that it was error for the court not to define the word \u201cknowingly.\u201d He advances no reason or analysis in support of his claim of error.\nIn Commonwealth v. Smith, 518 Pa. 15, 540 A.2d 246 (1988), we summarized cases involving definitional vagueness challenges to this very section of the statute. Also see, Commonwealth v. Griffin, 511 Pa. 553, 515 A.2d 865 (1986), and Commonwealth v. Stoyko, 504 Pa. 455, 475 A.2d 714 (1984). We determined in those cases that the violent acts themselves enable a jury to find that the actor knowingly created a grave risk of death to others. The jury merely applies the common sense meaning to such terms.\nIX. Prosecutorial Misconduct at the Closing\nAppellant alleges prosecutorial misconduct in dosing remarks to the jury. As best as can be gleaned from Appellant\u2019s brief, pp. 35-37, the statements and analyses forming the basis of the complaint include the following. First, the prosecutor said:\nNow, Mister Cannon [counsel for co-defendant Reese] told you that we just got an easy sell; that is, the police officers and the detectives from homicide and the Commonwealth when we took Jackson ...\nWell, Jackson earned his deal with the Commonwealth the hard way. When you have any crimes, whether it\u2019s economic crime, whether it\u2019s a crime of violence such as this or a simple theft, if somebody cannot identify the witnesses [sic], if we have only one perpetrator that\u2019s caught, yes, we will make an arrangement, a negotiation, a deal with \u2014 to get what we consider are the more serious people.\n* * * * * *\n[W]e have to enter into negotiations, no matter how distasteful it is for us, to arrive at the other perpetrators. Why? Because if it\u2019s within our knowledge, the police, that there were 2 more people on the street, there were 2 more killers on the street that we had to find.\nAnd that\u2019s why the deal was made.\n(T.T., April 23, 1984, pp. 198-200.)\nAppellant insists that it was improper to refer to any accused as a \u201ckiller.\u201d Additionally, he argues that by referring to \u201cwe\u201d as the prosecutor\u2019s office with experience in these matters in contrast to \u201cwhat we consider the more and fair assessment of the evidence. In particular, we have personal interpretations. Lacking any further explanation in this brief, the accusation is conclusory. Appellant appears to be suggesting that somehow such comparisons are morally invidious and lie beyond the pale of acceptable courtroom procedure. Labeling Appellant a \u201ckiller\u201d somehow inferred that he was \u201cmore culpable\u201d than co-defendant Reese.\nSecond, Appellant quotes the prosecutor\u2019s remarks (T.T., April 23, 1984, p. 204):\nHe /referring to Jackson/ didn\u2019t isolate himself from the facts in the case. And in every statement he always says Touche tells him that Lambert\u2019s the shooter.\nAnd in every statement he says that Touche lays it out that Touche went up to the bar to talk to the barmaid and the other person, Lambert, did the shooting.\nAppellant interprets such statements to mean that \u201cJackson says that Reese says that Appellant is the shooter.\u201d (Brief, p. 37.) Under this characterization, Appellant argues that the implication would violate the Bruton rule, since Appellant was not permitted to cross-examine witness Jackson on his relationship with Reese while these closing remarks to the jury allowed the prosecutor to use Jackson\u2019s statement to the police concerning what Reese had told him about Lambert\u2019s role in the crime.\nThird, Appellant complains that the prosecutor totally misstated the testimony of a witness, Richard DeLoach.\nOn numerous occasions we have held that a prosecuting attorney is forbidden to inject into evidence highly prejudicial personal opinions of a defendant\u2019s credibility on the grounds that it encroaches on the jury\u2019s exclusive function of weighing the evidence. The determination of guilt must be compelled intellectually from a disinterested and fair assessment of the evidence. In particular, we have struck hard at prosecutorial labelling of accused as \u201ccold blooded killers.\u201d Commonwealth v. Gilman, 470 Pa. 179, 188-192, 368 A.2d 253, 257-259 (1977) (collecting cases and incorporating both our Code of Professional Responsibility and ABA Standards).\nOn this evidence, nevertheless, we cannot hold that the first statement violated these rules. Explanatory references to plea bargains are commonplace and acceptable. The reference to \u201c2 more killers on the street\u201d was part of the explanation for the need to plea bargain with Jackson and, in any event, lacks the quality of directness towards the Appellant. Such remarks \u201cmust be evaluated in the context in which they occurred,\u201d Commonwealth v. Smith, 490 Pa. 380, 388, 416 A.2d 986, 989 (1980), and must rise to the level of unfairness or undue prejudice. Commonwealth v. Carpenter, 511 Pa. 429, 515 A.2d 531 (1986).\nAppellant\u2019s second argument that the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks violated the Bruton rule is equally devoid of any merit. The interpretation of the meaning of this statement is pure speculation by the Appellant and an invitation to us to read the jury\u2019s collective mind in a factual vacuum. We decline to enter that sophist world.\nFinally, the prosecution did not misstate witness DeLoach\u2019s testimony. The prosecutor\u2019s closing statement regarding this evidence is as follows (at T.T., April 23,1984, p. 211):\nNow, Mister Irwin in his closing told you that Mister DeLoach had testified that the person who got shot was towering over the shooter. Well, I submit to you ladies and gentlemen I don\u2019t recollect that evidence. It\u2019s up to you whether you remember that or not but\u2014\nMR. IRWIN: That\u2019s objected to.\nTHE COURT: Objection noted on the record.\nThe evidence of \u201ctowering over\u201d was part of the effort to establish the height of the true killer by contrasting the heights of Reese and Lambert.\nAppellant\u2019s present allegation is that by denying in front of the jury that witness DeLoach had given such a description, the prosecution engaged in misleading the fact-finder. A review of DeLoach\u2019s testimony, nevertheless, reveals no references to who \u201ctowered over\u201d whom. DeLoach stated simply that he could not identify the shooter who was shorter than he (T.T., April 11, 1984, pp. 167, 171), but the phrase \u201ctowering over him\u201d instead was used solely by defense counsel. (T.T., April 23, 1984, p. 112: \u201cHe was standing straight and the victim fell on top of him and was towering over him.\u201d \u201cHe\u201d referred to the shooter.) We determine that there was no misstatement of the trial testimony by the prosecutor because DeLoach never made such statement in the first instance.\nX. After-Discovered Evidence\nAppellant alleges error in Judge Geisz\u2019s refusal to grant an evidentiary hearing on the purported after-discovered evidence of Jackson\u2019s statement to defense counsel (as stated in counsel\u2019s motion) in which \u201che indicated that he forgot to tell the jury that Bruce Reese told him that he was the one who handed the barmaid, Janet Ryan, the bag and asked her for the money in Prince\u2019s Lounge.\u201d\nAt the outset, we take note of the fact that the statements attributed to Jackson are stated in counsel\u2019s own motion language, not Jackson\u2019s words in his purported affidavit. (Copies of the motion, the unsigned affidavit, and Judge Geisz\u2019s order are attached to Appellant\u2019s brief.) The trial court was correct in rejecting unsworn statements. More to the point, however, is our rule that after-discovered evidence forms the basis of a new trial only if: (1) it could not have been obtained at or prior to the conclusion of the trial through due diligence; (2) it is not merely corroborative or cumulative; (3) it will not be used for the sole purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness; and (4) it will likely result in a different verdict if a new trial were held. Commonwealth v. Colson, 507 Pa. 440, 490 A.2d 811 (1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1140, 106 S.Ct. 2245, 90 L.Ed.2d 692 (1986). Clearly this evidence could have been discovered much earlier with due diligence. Our prior rulings also look with much disfavor on post-verdict testimony of jailed accomplices whose sentences have been imposed by the court. Commonwealth v. Trefetz, 465 Pa. 614, 351 A.2d 265 (1976), cert. denied, 426 U.S. 940, 96 S.Ct. 2658, 49 L.Ed.2d 392 (1976). Lastly, even if the evidence were used, it merely would contradict the testimony of witness, Sarah Clark, that she, not Janet Ryan, was asked for the money. There was no error here.\nFinally, under our statutory duty to review death cases to determine whether the imposed sentence of death is \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases,\u201d according to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711 (h)(3)(iii), we have conducted an evaluation of all convictions of murder of the first degree prosecuted under the Act of September 13,1978, P.L. 756, No. 141, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711. We have reviewed the data and information pertaining to similar cases that have been compiled by the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts (AOPC) pursuant to this Court\u2019s directive as enumerated in Commonwealth v. Frey, 504 Pa. 428, 475 A.2d 700 (1984). We find that the sentence of death is not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 971 l(h)(3)(iii). We also find that the evidence supports the finding of an aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3)(ii), and that the sentences were not the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3)(i).\nFor the foregoing reasons, we uphold the convictions and affirm the sentence of death based on the conviction for murder of the first degree and the sentence of imprisonment for possession of an instrument of crime.\nLARSEN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\nSTOUT, Former J., did not participate in the decision of this matter.\nNIX, C.J., files a dissenting opinion in which ZAPPALA, J., joins.\nReassigned to this writer.\n. Jackson\u2019s testimony was in return for an open guilty plea to murder in the third degree, robbery, and crimes related to his previous admitted robberies.\n. The three aggravating circumstances were: (1) a killing in perpetuation of a felony; (2) in the commission of the offense, the defendant knowingly created a grave risk of death of another person in addition to the victim of the offense; (3) prior conviction for another federal or state offense committed either before or at the time of the offense for which a sentence of life imprisonment or death was imposable. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6), (7), (10). The mitigating circumstance was the absence of significant prior felony convictions. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(1) (relative to this mitigation, it should be noted that the prosecution refused to offer evidence at the penalty stage of a prior conviction for bank robbery. See Section V of this opinion).\n. Accord are United States v. Litman, 547 F.Supp. 645 (W.D.Pa.1982); and United States v. Barber, 442 F.2d 517 (3rd Cir.1971).\n. We hasten to add that the same rules governing severance of defendants where substantive crimes are charged apply with equal vigor to charges of conspiracy. In addition to Patterson, 519 Pa. at 198, 546 A.2d at 600, see Commonwealth v. Jackson, 451 Pa. 462, 303 A.2d 924 (1973) (joint trials for conspiracy are advisable). In accord with our law is United States v. DiPasquale, 561 F.Supp. 1338 (E.D.Pa. 1983), aff\u2019d, 740 F.2d 1282 (3rd Cir.1984).\n. We note, of course, that Appellant did engage in extensive cross-examination of Jackson under the court\u2019s limitation.\n. Appellant\u2019s counsel argued on this point as follows:\nIt\u2019s my position that prior to the preliminary hearing, I was court appointed counsel for James Lambert. I was informed by the prosecution that there were no identification witnesses in this case. Mister Myers can verify that. I specified that \u2014 I specifically asked him then and I was informed of that.\nNow, I had no reason to believe that he intentionally did this but the point is I was precluded from a lineup because I was told that there was no identification in this case other than Bernard Jackson.\n(T.T., April 19, 1984, p. 86.)\n. Appellant also cites this allegation in support of his severance argument.\n. Bruton overruled Delli Paoli v. United States, 352 U.S. 232, 77 S.Ct. 294, 1 L.Ed.2d 278 (1957). Bruton binds federal and state courts as a result of Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965), making the Sixth Amendment applicable to the state. We hold in this case under review that the Bruton rule is in accord with our state constitution, Art. 1, \u00a7 9: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused hath a right ... to meet the witnesses face to face.\u201d\n. In a related, but separately stated allegation, Appellant argues that the prosecution should have explained to the jury that Appellant had no significant history of criminal convictions since the Judge had found this to be a fact. As indicated herein, the jury found this same mitigating circumstance without the instruction.\n. Accord is Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974):\nWhile these general observations in no way justify prosecutorial misconduct, they do suggest that a court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\n94 S.Ct. at 1873.\nWe point out also that this was a pitched trial marked by heat-of-battle incidents and remarks between contending attorneys: \"faggot,\u201d \"baby,\u201d \"Nazi,\" and other epithets. See, for example, T.T., April 13, 1984, pp. 91-97, and April 25, 1984, p. 48.\n. The Prothonotary of the Eastern District is directed to transmit the full and complete record of the trial, sentencing hearing, imposition of sentence, and review by this Court to the Governor. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 971 l(i)."}
