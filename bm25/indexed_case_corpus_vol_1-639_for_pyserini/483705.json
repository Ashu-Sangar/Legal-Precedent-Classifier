{"id": "483705", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM.\nThe appellant stands convicted of murder in the first degree and here argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict. Viewing the evidence, as we must, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, Commonwealth v. Murray, 460 Pa. 605, 334 A.2d 255 (filed March 18, 1975); Commonwealth v. Paquette, 451 Pa. 250, 301 A.2d 837 (1973), we find the evidence sufficient to sustain the verdict of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\nJudgment affirmed."}
