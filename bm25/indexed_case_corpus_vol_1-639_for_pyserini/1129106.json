{"id": "1129106", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nPlaintiff appeals from the order of the court below refusing to take off a nonsuit. Appellant was struck by defendants\u2019 automobile while crossing Lancaster Avenue where it intersects with Fortieth Street and Haverford Avenue, in the City of Philadelphia. The trial judge entered a compulsory nonsuit because plaintiff\u2019s evidence was insufficient to prove negligence on the part of defendants\u2019 agent operating the car, and, after reading and considering the evidence presented in the record, we see no error in that conclusion.\nThe order is affirmed."}
