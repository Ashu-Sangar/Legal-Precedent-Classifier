{"id": "823801", "contents": "Opinion,\nMb. Justice Stebbett :\nIn the court below three exceptions were filed by defendant to the prothonotary\u2019s taxation of Sheriff Burkholder\u2019s costs. Two of these were fully sustained, and the other sustained in part. The costs were re-taxed accordingly, and this appeal was then taken by the sheriff.\nThe first and third exceptions were grounded on defective service of the writs therein mentioned, \u201c improper advertising, and failure to notify defendant or to serve sale bill on him,\u201d in consequence of which omissions of duty the writs were set aside by the court. It was therefore contended that, by reason of his negligence, the sheriff had no right to claim the items of costs specified in either of said exceptions.\nThe court, upon evidence that was quite sufficient, found that the facts as claimed by defendant were true, and rightly sustained both exceptions. In this there was certainly .no error of which appellant has any just reason to complain; and, unless we are prepared to say that neglect of official duty, whereby parties litigant are subjected to vexatious delay and expense, is sufficient ground on which to base a claim for fees, etc., the decree in this case should be affirmed. It requires neither argument nor citation of authority to show that the conclusions reached by the court below are correct. Except as to an overcharge of twenty-five cents for writ, the second exception was rightly dismissed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed, with costs to be paid by appellant."}
