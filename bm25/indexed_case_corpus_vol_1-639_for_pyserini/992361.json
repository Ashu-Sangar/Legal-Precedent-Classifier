{"id": "992361", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe facts are not specifically found, nor has a diligent examination of the.record disclosed them with sufficient certainty to afford any basis for a judgment on the merits. The case must therefore go back for fuller investigation, and in the mean time it is for the interest of all parties that the situation on the ground should remain unchanged. The decree is therefore affirmed pro forma and the case remitted for final hearing."}
