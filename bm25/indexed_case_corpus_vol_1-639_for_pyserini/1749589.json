{"id": "1749589", "contents": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nThis is an appeal from appellant\u2019s conviction of murder of the first degree, and conspiracy which arose from the slaying of Domingo Martinez on November 10, 1973. Appellant raises five issues for review, all of which are without merit.\n1. Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the jury\u2019s verdict.\n2. That the trial court erred in not suppressing appellant\u2019s confession on the grounds that it was a product of an unnecessary delay following arrest.\n3. That appellant\u2019s waiver of his rights and subsequent confession were involuntary.\n4. That the trial court erred by failing to give the proper instruction on aiding and abetting.\n5. That appellant received ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel failed to request a charge on involuntary manslaughter, and because trial counsel failed to preserve for appeal the adequacy of the jury\u2019s charge on conspiracy.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\n. A review of the record, conducted pursuant to the Act of February 15, 1870, P.L. 15, \u00a7 2, 19 P.S. 1187 reveals that there was sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict."}
