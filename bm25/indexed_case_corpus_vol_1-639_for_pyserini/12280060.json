{"id": "12280060", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nThe Commonwealth appeals from the Superior Court\u2019s order finding appellee Raymond Farabaugh is not required to register as a sexual offender. Upon review, we are constrained to reverse.\nIn 2011, appellee pled guilty to indecent assault, graded as a second-degree misdemeanor. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3126(a)(8), (b)(1). On June 28, 2011, the trial court sentenced him to two years probation; at the time of sentencing, the law did not require appellee to register as a sexual offender. Later that year, amendments to Megan\u2019s Law added crimes to the list defined as sexually violent offenses, and established a three-tiered system for classifying such offenses and their corresponding registration periods. See Act of December 20, 2011, P.L. 446, No. 111, \u00a7 12 (effective December 20, 2012) (Megan\u2019s Law IV). The 2011 amendments became effective December 20, 2012; they applied to individuals who, as of that date, were convicted of a sexually violent offense and were incarcerated, on probation or parole, or subject to intermediate punishment. See id. (codified as amended at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.13). Thus, appellee was subject to the reporting and registration requirements, see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.13(2), and, as a Tier-II sexual offender, id., \u00a7 9799.14(c)(1.3), was required to register for 25 years, id., \u00a7 9799.15(a)(2).\nAfter Megan\u2019s Law IV went into effect, appellee filed a \u201cPetition to Enforce Plea Bargain/Habeas Corpus,\u201d arguing that ordering him to comply with the new registration and reporting requirements violated his plea agreement and various state and federal constitutional provisions. The trial court denied the petition, and appellee appealed to the Superior Court.\nOn March 14, 2014, while the appeal was pending in the Superior Court, after the parties had submitted their briefs, the governor signed Act 19 into law, amending the provisions of Megan\u2019s Law again; the Act was effective immediately and made retroactive to December 20, 2012. See Act of March 14, 2014, P.L. 41, No. 19, \u00a7\u00a7 7-8. Relevant to this appeal, Act 19 added the following provision, in pertinent part: \u201cFor purposes of this paragraph, the term \u2018sexually violent offense\u2019 ... shall not include ... [a] conviction under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8126 (relating to indecent assault) where the crime is graded as a misdemeanor of the second degree.\u201d Id., \u00a7 3 (codified at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.13(3.1)(ii)(B)).\nThe Superior Court panel sua sponte addressed Act 19, holding the above language exempted appellee from the requirements of Megan\u2019s Law. The panel interpreted paragraph (3.1) as excluding convictions of indecent assault as a second-degree misdemeanor from every class of registrants in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.13. Thus, the panel reasoned appellee \u201ceffectively never was[] subject to the Megan\u2019s Law registration requirements\u201d because Act 19 was made retroactive to December 20, 2012\u2014the effective date of Megan\u2019s Law IV, which appellee was challenging. Commonwealth v. Farabaugh, No. 1198 WDA 2013, unpublished memorandum at 4, 105 A.3d 36 (Pa.Super. filed June 17, 2014). As a result, the panel determined appellee\u2019s constitutional issues were moot, vacated the trial court\u2019s order, and remanded.\nThe Commonwealth filed a Petition for Allowance of Appeal, and we granted review of the following question:\nWhether the Superior Court erred, while acting sua sponte, when it incorrectly found that new amendments to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.13 excluded the crime of [ijndecent [a]ssault (18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3126(a)(8)) from list [sic] of mandated sex offender registry crimes.\nCommonwealth v. Farabaugh, 629 Pa. 312, 105 A.3d 655 (2014) (per curiam) (alterations in original); see also 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 724. As this issue involves statutory construction, which is a pure question of law, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. Commonwealth v. Stotelmyer, 631 Pa. 213, 110 A.3d 146, 149 (2015) (citation omitted). \u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d Id., \u00a7 1921(b).\nThe General Assembly passed Act 19 in response to this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Neiman, 624 Pa. 53, 84 A.3d 603, 605 (2013), which struck down prior amendments to Megan\u2019s Law because the act in which they were contained violated the single-subject rule, Pa. Const. art. III, \u00a7 3. See generally Act of March 14, 2014, P.L. 41, No. 19, \u00a7 1 (codified at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.11(b)(3)) (\u201cIt is the intention of the General Assembly to address the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Neiman, 624 Pa. 53, 84 A.3d 603 (2013), by amending this subchapter in [Act 19].\u201d). As amended by Act 19, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.13 is composed of 15 paragraphs, two of which are relevant for this appeal\u2014 paragraph (2) and paragraph (3.1), which provide:\nThe following individuals shall register with the Pennsylvania State Police ... and otherwise comply with the provisions of this subchapter:\n(2) An individual who, on or after the effective date of this section, is, as a result of a conviction for a sexually violent offense, an inmate in a State or county correctional institution of this Commonwealth, including a community corrections center or a community contract facility, is being supervised by the Pennsylvania Board of Proba tion and Parole or county probation or parole, is subject to a sentence of intermediate punishment or has supervision transferred pursuant to the Interstate Compact for Adult Supervision in accordance with section 9799.19(g).\n* * *\n(3.1) The following:\n(i) An individual who between January 23, 2005, and December 19, 2012, was:\n(A) convicted of a sexually violent offense;\n(B) released from a period of incarceration resulting from a conviction for a sexually violent offense; or\n(C) under the supervision of the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole or county probation or parole as a result of a conviction for a sexually violent offense.\n(ii) For purposes of this paragraph, the term \u201csexually violent offense \u201d shall have the meaning set forth in section 9799.12 (relating to definitions), except that it shall not include:\n(B) A conviction under 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3126 (relating to indecent assault) where the crime is graded as a misdemeanor of the second degree or where the conviction occurred between January 22, 2006, and January 1, 2007, when the crime is graded as a felony of the third degree.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.13(2), (3.1) (emphasis added).\nThe parties agree that appellee meets the criteria of both paragraph (2) and paragraph (3.1). See Appellee\u2019s Brief, at 11; Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 18-19. The Commonwealth argues the Superior Court panel erred in interpreting paragraph (3.1) as excluding appellee\u2019s conviction from every class of registrants in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.13, including paragraph (2); indecent assault convictions are excluded only from the class of registrants in paragraph (3.1), and because appellee is a paragraph (2) registrant, the panel erred in holding he does not have to comply with Megan\u2019s Law.\nThe exclusion of indecent assault from the term \u201csexually violent offense \u201d applies only \u201c[f]or purposes of this paragraph [.] \u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.13(3.1)(ii) (emphasis added). As the Commonwealth points out, \u201cparagraph\u201d is a technical term that must be analyzed and defined according to its \u201cpeculiar and appropriate meaning or definition.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903. In this regard, the Commonwealth cites 101 Pa.Code \u00a7 23.26, which provides: \u201cWhenever internal divisions are necessary, ... paragraphs [shall be identified] by Arabic numerals ... contained within parentheses[.]\u201d Id. The Commonwealth urges the Court to interpret \u00a7 9799.13 consistently with the manner in which we interpreted \u201cparagraph\u201d in Rump v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 551 Pa. 339, 710 A.2d 1093, 1096-97 (1998).\nAdditionally, the Commonwealth argues the two paragraphs do not conflict. It construes paragraph (3.1) as applying only to \u201coffenders (1) whose convictions occurred during the enumerated Megan\u2019s Law III time period and (2) who are not also still subject to imprisonment or supervision as of December 20, 2012.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 18. \u201cThis interpretation is in accord with the express intent of Act 19,\u201d the Commonwealth contends, \u201cwhich was to respond to the Neiman decision\u2014not to more generally limit [the] retroactive application\u201d of the registration and reporting requirements. Id. (citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.11(b)(3)). But, if we were to determine there is a conflict, the Commonwealth argues the paragraphs are reconcilable. Specifically, while some offenders, like appellee, meet the criteria for paragraph (2) and paragraph (3.1), the Commonwealth asserts \u201cmere overlap between provisions of a statute[,] without more[,] does not mean the paragraphs are irreconcilable.\u201d Id., at 19 (citing Cedarbrook Realty, Inc. v. Nahill, 484 Pa. 441, 399 A.2d 374, 383 (1979) (\u201c[A] showing] that the two statutory schemes are different and may be overlapping ... does not amount to irreconcilability under Pennsylvania law.\u201d)).\nAppellee first argues this Court\u2019s decision in Neiman \u201cwas not the sole purpose of Act 19\u201d because Act 19 made two additional changes to Megan\u2019s Law. Appellee\u2019s Brief, at 7 (\u201c[A] ... loophole was closed ... [and] credit was given to offenders who were required to register prior to [Act 19] for the time periods upon which they had registered before the passage of [Act 19].\u201d (citations omitted)). Appellee posits that because he fits the criteria of paragraph (2) and paragraph (3.1), the provisions are in conflict, and the conflict is irreconcilable. Therefore, appellee argues paragraph (3.1) should be construed as an exception to the general rule in paragraph (2), because paragraph (3.1) is more specific and was enacted after paragraph (2), and nothing suggests the legislature intended for paragraph (2) to control. Id., at 11 (quoting 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1933) (\u201cIf the conflict between [ ] two provisions is irreconcilable, the special provisions shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision, unless the general provision shall be enacted later and it shall be the manifest intention of the General Assembly that such general provisions shall prevail.\u201d).\nAppellee contends the Commonwealth\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 9799.13 would require this Court to read words into the statute. Id., at 12 (\u201cThe key language missing from [paragraph] (3.1) would state that individuals who were subject to imprisonment and supervision and who\u2019s [sic] imprisonment and supervision has ended prior to December 19, 2012[,] would be exempt under [paragraph] (3.1).\u201d). Finally, appellee argues that ruling for the Commonwealth would have two unintended consequences. First, appellee claims it would \u201cput individuals like [a]ppellee in a separate and distinct class from individuals who were convicted of [i]ndecent [a]ssault as [a misdemeanor of the [s]econd [d]egree during the pendency of Megan\u2019s Law III but were not require [sic] to register.\u201d Id., at 18. Second, appellee claims the Commonwealth\u2019s interpretation of paragraph (2) would mandate registration \u201cbut for the continued supervision or imprisonment of the individual[,]\u201d which he asserts would \u201ceradieat[e]\u201d this Court\u2019s holding that Megan\u2019s Law registration and reporting requirements are a collateral, civil consequence of a criminal conviction. Id., at 18-19 (citing Commonwealth v. Leidig, 598 Pa. 211, 956 A.2d 399 (2008)).\nTo understand the meaning of the \u201cfor purposes of this paragraph\u201d language \u201centails an understanding of how the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes are arranged.\u201d Rump, at 1096. Most statutes are \u201csubdivided into subsections, paragraphs, subparagraphs, and other such minor subdivisions as may be required for clarity of expression and uniformity of style.\u201d Id. (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 301(c)). Section 23.26 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes Style Manual, 101 Pa. Code \u00a7\u00a7 21.1 et seq., titled \u201cInternal divisions of sections,\u201d provides:\nWhenever internal divisions are necessary, subsections shall be identified by lower case letters, paragraphs by Arabic numerals, subparagraphs by lower case Roman numerals, clauses by capital letters and subclauses by capital Roman numerals, all contained within parentheses, as follows:\nTerminology Ilhistrative Symbol\nSubsection (a)\nParagraph (1)\nSubparagraph (i)\nClause (A)\nSubelause (I)\nId., \u00a7 23.26 (emphasis added). Moreover, \u201cwe must assume that the General Assembly knew what a paragraph meant in terms of constructing a statutory provision[.]\u201d Rump, at 1097.\nBased on these principles, we hold the Superior Court erred in finding Act 19 excluded appellee from registering as a sexual offender. It is clear that provision (3.1) of \u00a7 9799.13 is \u201ca paragraph since it is illustrated by an Arabic numeral.\u201d Id. If the legislature intended the paragraph (3.1) exception to apply to each class of registrants in \u00a7 9799.13, it would have used the phrase \u201cfor purposes of this section>\u201d but that is not what the statute says, and we may not read words into an unambiguous statutory provision. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). The phrase \u201cfor purposes of this paragraph\u201d demonstrates the exclusion applies only to paragraph (3.1), as the word \u201cparagraph\u201d in this context is a technical term with a specific meaning. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903.\nWe reject appellee\u2019s contention that paragraph (2) and paragraph (3.1) are irreconcilable. Paragraph (2) applies to individuals, like appellee, who were still serving sentences on December 20, 2012, whereas paragraph (3.1) pertains to individuals who were convicted, released from prison, or were on probation or parole between January 23, 2005, and December 19, 2012\u2014the day before the effective date of Megan\u2019s Law IV and Act 19. Accordingly, we hold the second-degree-misdemeanor-indecent-assault exception applies only to paragraph (3.1); thus, the Superior Court erred in concluding appellee did not have to comply with the reporting and registration requirements of Megan\u2019s Law.\nOrder reversed; case remanded to the Superior Court to address the issues appellee preserved for appeal; jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice SAYLOR and Justices BAER, TODD and STEVENS join the opinion.\nChief Justice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion in which Justice TODD joins.\n. The panel noted appellee waived three other issues for failing to raise them in the trial court. Id., at 3-4 & n. 2.\n. Section 9799.13 is not divided into subsections. See 101 Pa.Code \u00a7 23.26 (\u201cInternal divisions of sections,\u201d discussed infra).\n. However, the legislature\u2019s express statement of intent was to the contrary. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.11(b)(3) (\u201cIt is the intention of the General Assembly to address the Pennsylvania Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Neiman, 624 Pa. 53, 84 A.3d 603 (2013), by amending this subchapter in [Act 19].\u201d).\n. Parenthetically, it defies logic that the legislature would exclude all convictions for 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3126(a)(8) from every class of registrants in \u00a7 9799.13, when that crime continues to be listed as a Tier-II sexual offense, see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.14(c)(1.3).\n. Further, paragraph (3.2), which also was added by Act 19, refers to \"paragraph (3.1),\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.13(3.2), thereby buttressing the conclusion that the legislature intended the indecent-assault exclusion to apply only to paragraph (3.1), not the entire section."}
