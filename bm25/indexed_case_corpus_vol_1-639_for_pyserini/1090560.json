{"id": "1090560", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nAndrew A. Kauffman, a soldier of the United States, while at Camp Gordon, wrote a long social letter to his brother, D. Lynn Kauffman, the present appellant, on May 28, 1918, incidentally saying therein: \u201cI am going to take out $10,000 insurance and make it payable to you and you can give some to the rest of them, after E. A. gets half of it and you get % of it, if anything happens to me.\u201d \u201cE. A.\u201d is a daughter of appellant.\nOn June 4,1918, Andrew A. Kauffman applied to the Bureau of War Bisk Insurance for a $10,000 policy, which was issued to him, but no person was named therein as beneficiary.\nKauffman died October 11,1919, with the insurance in force, and, on October 8, 1920, the letter containing the above-quoted paragraph was admitted to probate as his will.\nLouisa Kauffman, mother of decedent, appealed to the orphans\u2019 court, which reversed the decision of the register, and the present appeal ensued.\nThe court below says, in its opinion setting aside the probate: \u201cThe statement I am going to take out $10,000 insurance and make it payable to you,\u201d is only a declaration of what the writer intended to do, but which intention he never carried out......The only part of the declaration which he actually put into effect was the taking out of an insurance policy in the amount mentioned ; he did not make it payable to the appellee. Just why he changed his mind......does not appear; possibly it was because his old mother was still living, or possibly because he had a sister and four brothers living.\u201d The court then correctly states that the writing offered for probate could not have been intended as anything more than a declaration of the manner in which decedent desired his brother to dispose of the fund to be derived from the insurance which the former, at that time, intended giving to the latter, a gift never in fact made, however. In other words, the letter was not in any sense a testamentary writing but only a direction as to the disposition of an intended gift, inter vivos, which decedent never completed. Or, to put the situation more precisely as the court below viewed it: When decedent wrote concerning the prospective insurance, it is apparent he did not refer to, or attempt to dispose of, an asset belonging to his estate, or even of one he then contemplated acquiring, since the policy he mentioned was not to be taken out for the benefit of his estate, but directly for the advantage of others, \u2014 his brother to be named as beneficiary; therefore the letter can have no proper control over the fund here in controversy, and it should not be viewed as a testamentary writing disposing of this insurance, which, differing from the policy mentioned in the letter, was payable to and collected by decedent\u2019s estate.\nThe court below did not err in refusing to sustain the probate.\nThe decree is affirmed at cost of appellant."}
