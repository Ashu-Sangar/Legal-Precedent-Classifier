{"id": "539274", "contents": "The opinion of the court was filed January 26th, 1885.\nPer Curiam.\nWe think the remainder was vested in the heirs. The decree is therefore right on the merits. Inasmuch, however, as the appellant accepted the sum awarded to her she waived her right to appeal: Marten\u2019s Appeal, 13 W. N. C. 289. Rightfully assuming that she was satisfied with the decree, the executors paid over the residue to the persons to whom it was decreed. Therefore, having no right to appeal,\nAppeal quashed."}
