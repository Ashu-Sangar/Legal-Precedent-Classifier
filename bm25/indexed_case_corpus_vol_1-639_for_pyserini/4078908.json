{"id": "4078908", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 12th day of February, 2014, the Court being evenly divided, the Order of the Superior Court is AFFIRMED.\nFormer Justice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nJustice EAKIN files a lead Opinion in Support of Affirmance in which Chief Justice CASTILLE joins.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files an Opinion in Support of Affirmance in which Justice BAER joins.\nJustice TODD files an Opinion in Support of Reversal in which Justices SAYLOR and McCAFFERY join.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMANCE\nJustice EAKIN.\nIn this appeal, we are asked to consider whether a second violation within one year of \u00a7 305(a)(1) of the Pennsylvania Dog Law, 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-305(a)(l), is an absolute liability offense. For the following reasons, we would find it is an absolute liability offense and would affirm the Superior Court.\nThe underlying facts are undisputed. On the evening of July 9, 2009, appellant\u2019s Giant Schnauzer, Muncy, left appellant\u2019s premises, crossed the street, and attacked another dog that was being walked by its owner. Approximately 10 to 15 minutes after the incident, a neighbor observed appellant place an electric fence collar on Muncy\u2019s neck. The local police were called concerning the incident, and issued appellant a citation pursuant to \u00a7 305(a)(1). Following a bench trial, the trial court found appellant guilty of a second violation of \u00a7 305(a)(1) within one year, a misdemeanor of the third degree; he was sentenced to six months of non-reporting probation and ordered to pay a $500 fine. Based on its determination that a second violation of \u00a7 305(a)(1) is an absolute liability offense, the court did not require the Commonwealth to present evidence of appellant\u2019s intent or knowledge regarding Muncy\u2019s non-confinement.\nAppellant appealed, claiming the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 305(a)(1) as an absolute liability offense was erroneous. The Superior Court affirmed, finding scienter was not an element of the offense. Commonwealth v. Raban, 31 A.3d 699, 702 (Pa.Super.2011). Specifically, the court agreed with the rationale of prior decisions interpreting \u00a7 305(a)(1) and its predecessor as an absolute liability offense given the clear legislative intent to further public safety by prohibiting roaming dogs. Id., at 702-03 (quoting Commonwealth v. Glumac, 717 A.2d 572, 574 (Pa.Super.1998)) (\u201c \u2018In enacting [\u00a7 305(a)(1) ], the legislature intended to require dog owners to prevent their dogs from running at large.... The protection of the public\u2019s health and safety are attained when dogs are safely secured or accompanied when not so confined.\u2019 \u201d); accord Baehr v. Commonwealth ex rel. Lower Merlon Township, 51 Pa.Cmwlth. 241, 414 A.2d 415, 417 (1980) (interpreting identical language in \u00a7 305(a)(l)\u2019s predecessor and concluding it \u201cunmistakably speaks in terms of strict liability for its violation, and a moment\u2019s reflection on the purpose of the statute buttresses [this] conclusion\u201d). The court noted:\nThe mandate to confine a dog is ... stated absolutely and not in terms of reasonable care, which standard ... would involve difficulties in ascertaining culpability and thus frustrate the legislative intent behind [\u00a7 ] 305(a)(1). Had the legislature intended [\u00a7 ] 305(a)(1) to condition culpability on the failure to make reasonable efforts at confinement, it could have easily stated so. As written, however, [\u00a7 ] 305(a) unequivocally proscribes the failure to confine one\u2019s dog to one\u2019s premises, period.\nRaban, at 703.\nThis Court granted allocatur to determine whether \u00a7 305(a)(1) is an absolute liability offense. Commonwealth v. Raban, 616 Pa. 590, 52 A.3d 222 (2012) (per curiam). As this issue presents a pure question of law, our standard of review is de novo and scope of review is plenary. Delaware County v. First Union Corporation, 605 Pa. 547, 992 A.2d 112, 118 (2010) (citation omitted). Appellant urges this Court to reverse the Superior Court\u2019s decision, arguing it has the potential to lead to absurd results, improperly elevates prosecution convenience to a primary concern, and ignores the requirement that the legislative intent to impose absolute liability plainly appear. The Commonwealth counters that legislative intent to do away with a mens rea element is evident from the plain statutory language \u201cshall be unlawful\u201d and the omission of any express scienter requirement. To the extent this Court finds \u00a7 305(a)(1) unclear, the Commonwealth asserts the following considerations weigh heavily in favor of finding legislative intent to impose absolute liability: (1) \u201cthe mischief to be remedied is roving dogs which is in the public interest\u201d and (2) \u00a7 305(a)(l)\u2019s predecessor contained identical language and was interpreted as an absolute liability offense. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 14-15 (citation omitted); see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(3), (5) (delineating considerations to be applied in determining legislative intent). In response to appellant\u2019s examples of \u201cabsurd\u201d results stemming from interpreting \u00a7 305(a)(1) as an absolute liability offense, the Commonwealth notes defenses focusing on third-party action are still available for absolute liability offenses and contends appellant\u2019s argument is based on a misapplication of the absurdity doctrine. The Commonwealth contends \u201c[t]he absurdity doctrine allows that a provision may be either disregarded or judicially corrected as an error I if failing to do so would result in a disposition that no reasonable person could approve\u201d and only applies \u201cto correct obviously unintended dispositions[.]\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 17, 19. Section 305(a), the Commonwealth argues, was specifically written as a strict liability offense to \u201cpromote[ ] the public welfare by enforcing compliance through the regulation and confinement of dogs\u201d; therefore, the absurdity doctrine does not apply. Id., at 19 (citations omitted).\nWe begin our analysis keeping in mind that absolute liability criminal offenses are \u201cgenerally disfavored,\u201d and an offense will not be considered to impose absolute liability absent some indication of a legislative directive to dispense -with mens rea. Commonwealth v. Mayfield, 574 Pa. 460, 832 A.2d 418, 426 (2003) (citation omitted). The question of whether a culpability requirement applies to a given offense is a matter of construction to be determined by the language of the statute, in light of its manifest purpose and design. Commonwealth v. Ludwig, 583 Pa. 6, 874 A.2d 623, 630 (2005). Accordingly, we turn to the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1501 et seq., which dictates that our primary goal is to effectuate the intent of the General Assembly. Id., \u00a7 1921(a). The best indication of such intent is the plain language of the statute; if such language is clear and unambiguous, it must be applied. Id., \u00a7 1921(b). However, where the statutory language is not explicit, we may apply several considerations to ascertain the legislative intent, including \u201c[t]he mischief to be remedied[,]\u201d \u201c[t]he former law,\u201d and \u201c[t]he consequences of a particular interpretation.\u201d Id., \u00a7 1921(c)(3), (5)-(6). Moreover, we are to assume the legislature did not intend a result that is unreasonable, absurd, or impossible of execution. Id., \u00a7 1922(1). Lastly, since \u00a7 305(a) is a penal statute, it must be strictly construed. Id., \u00a7 1928(b)(1).\nWith these principles in mind, we turn to the relevant statutory language. Section 305(a)(1) states, in pertinent part: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for the owner or keeper of any dog to fail to keep at all times the dog I confined within the premises of the owner[.]\u201d 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-305(a)(l). While a first violation is a summary offense, a second violation within a year of sentencing for the first violation is a third degree misdemean- or expressly punishable by a fine between $500 and $1,000 and/or up to one year imprisonment. Id., \u00a7 459-903(b)(l)-(2). Importantly for purposes of this appeal, the language proscribing the non-confinement of dogs is identical for first and second offenses.\nSince \u00a7 305(a)(1) does not expressly denote a culpability element, further inquiry is required to discern whether the General Assembly intended it to be an absolute liability offense. Section 302 of the Crimes Code provides default culpability standards to be applied where such is not otherwise prescribed, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(c); however, this default provision is inapplicable to summary offenses and offenses wherein the legislature\u2019s intent to impose absolute liability \u201cplainly appears.\u201d Id., \u00a7 305(a). As noted previously, while a first violation of \u00a7 305(a)(1) is a summary offense, to which the default culpability provision is expressly inapplicable, a second violation is a third degree misdemeanor. Accordingly, we must determine whether it \u201cplainly appears\u201d the legislature intended \u00a7 305(a)(1) to be an absolute liability offense.\nWe find the statute\u2019s language denotes a purpose of imposing absolute liability, a purpose that \u201cplainly appears,\u201d see id., \u00a7 305(a)(2), given the choice of the word \u201cfail,\u201d a word that is unambiguous, and is utilized without mention or consideration of intent or excuse. See 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-305(a). Section 305(a)(1) speaks in clearly obligatory terms \u2014 \u201cIt shall be unlawful for the owner or keeper of any dog to fail to keep at all times\u201d the dog confined. Id., \u00a7 459-305(a)(l) (emphasis added). If one chooses to own or keep a dog, the failure to keep it confined violates the plain and unambiguous language of the statute, regardless of the reason for failure. Like failing to drive within the speed limit, the reasons for failing do not determine whether the driver is in violation. The driver\u2019s explanation may convince an officer not to write the ticket, or may convince a jurist to give the driver a pass, but if one fails to comply, one is in violation of the statute regardless of intent.\nWe find unconvincing the Opinion in Support of Reversal\u2019s conjecture that the word \u201c \u2018fail[s]\u2019 I could suggest an assessment of reasonableness of action taken to confine a dog, implying a culpability component.\u201d OISR, at 478. Respectfully, this is a major stretch. The question here is legislative purpose \u2014 having to use \u201ccould suggest\u201d and \u201cimplying\u201d in the same sentence is not a persuasive endorsement of legislative purpose. There is nothing in the austere words of this statute that \u201ccould suggest\u201d liability requires an assessment of \u201creasonableness of action.\u201d The word \u201cfail\u201d simply does not include a middle ground, nor does it envision explanations \u2014 if one fails, one fails.\nThat there is an excuse does not make the failure nonexistent \u2014 it may mitigate the consequences, but it does not erase the unassailable fact of failure. When a Giant Schnauzer is across the street attacking another dog, the keeper has failed to confine it, plain and simple. Why the keeper failed is not part of the statutory equation, and there is not one word in this law suggesting pre-failure actions are relevant in the least.\nThe classic law school illustration of absolute liability is the keeping of a tiger. If one keeps a pet tiger and it escapes, the keeper is responsible for the consequences of the escape regardless of the precautions taken to prevent the same. The choice to keep the tiger, like the choice to keep the dog, is yours to make, but it comes with absolute responsibility if the animal becomes unconfined, regardless of the reason therefor. If \u00a7 305(a)(1) applied to tigers, no one would have any problem with calling it an absolute liability crime. The clear intent of the legislature is to keep the animals confined or controlled, and a keeper is not excused because they tried really, really hard to confine the dog but failed, a second time.\nContrast, if you will, \u00a7 504-A of the very same dog law. If a dog has been determined by a court to be a \u201cdangerous dog\u201d because of prior attacks, it is a crime for the keeper of the dog \u201cto permit the dog\u201d to be outside the proper enclosure. 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-504-A (emphasis added). There is a significant difference between permitting a dangerous dog to be outside\u2014 clearly involving an intent element \u2014 and failing to confine a dog, bespeaking nothing but absolute liability. Had the legislature wanted to make \u00a7 305(a)(1) a crime of intent, it would have made it illegal to permit any dog to be unconfined. Section 504-A demonstrates the legislature knew how, and chose not, to do so.\n\u201cFails\u201d is a simple and definite word \u2014 absent an adjective suggesting that the reason for failure is relevant, the requirements of the statute are just as simple and definite. The reason for failure is simply not an element the legislature chose to put into the equation, and we should not add our own creative mathematics to it.\nOur conclusion that a second violation of \u00a7 305(a)(1) is an absolute liability offense is further buttressed by the absurd result that would occur if we were to come to the opposite conclusion \u2014 the elements of the offense would differ depending upon whether the defendant was a first or second offender, with the Commonwealth being required to prove mens rea for a second offense but not a first. While the OISR dismisses this as an \u201coddity\u201d mandated by \u00a7 305(a) of the Crimes Code, OISR, at 479 n. 8, our responsibility does not allow us to ignore such an interpretive disconnect. This is the type of unreasonable result we are to assume the legislature did not intend. See 1 Pa.C.S.1922(l) (\u201cIn ascertaining the intention of the General Assembly in the enactment of a statute ... [we are to assume] the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.\u201d). This is not an oddity \u2014 it is the trout in the milk.\nAccordingly, we would hold \u00a7 305(a)(1) is an absolute liability offense and would affirm the Superior Court.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMANCE\nChief Justice CASTILLE.\nI join Mr. Justice Eakin\u2019s Opinion in Support of Affirmance, because the statute at issue unambiguously creates an absolute liability offense. Section 305 of the Dog Law provides, in pertinent part, that it \u201cshall be unlawful for the owner or keeper of any dog to fail to keep at all times the dog in any of the following manners: (1) confined within the premises of the owner; (2) firmly secured by means of a collar and chain - or other device so that it cannot stray beyond the premises on which it is secured; or (3) under the reasonable control of some person, or when engaged in lawful hunting, exhibition, performance events or field training.\u201d 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-305(a). The Opinion in Support of Reversal (\u201cOISR\u201d) argues that this statute includes \u201csomewhat obligatory terms\u201d that do \u201cnot necessarily equate to an intent to impose absolute liability.\u201d OISR at 477-78. But, just like Justice Eakin, I cannot agree that the language of Section 305 provides a mere suggestion. The plain language of the statute is mandatory, and clearly it includes no express scienter requirement. See, e.g., Baehr v. Commonwealth, ex rel. Lower Merion Twp., 51 Pa.Cmwlth. 241, 414 A.2d 415, 417 (1980) (identically-worded predecessor statute \u201cunmistakably speaks in terms of strict liability for its violation, and a moment\u2019s reflection on the purpose of the statute buttresses our conclusion\u201d). See also Commonwealth v. Glumac, 717 A.2d 572 (Pa.Super.1998) (purpose of Section 305 is to prevent dogs from roaming streets and thus to protect public health and safety). Given the obvious public welfare purpose of the statute, I find no ambiguity in its language. And, at the time of the incident involved here, Muncy the dog was not confined within the owner\u2019s premises, was not confined by means of a collar or chain or other device to prevent its straying beyond those premises, and was not under anyone\u2019s reasonable control. Muncy ran freely across the street and attacked another dog. The evidence presented was sufficient to find a violation. The mere fortuity that there were no serious injuries involved here does nothing to diminish the fact that Muncy\u2019s uncontrolled and potentially dangerous behavior clearly demonstrates the reason why such a statute exists, and why its violation should constitute an absolute liability offense. Indeed, requiring scienter effectively neuters the statute; which is ironic since the statute is intended to neuter the carelessness of dog owners such as appellant.\nAccordingly, I would affirm the decision of the Superior Court.\nJustice BAER joins this Opinion in Support of Affirmance.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL\nJustice TODD.\nThe issue in this appeal by allowance is whether a second violation, within one year, of Section 305(a)(1) of the Pennsylvania Dog Law (\u201cDog Law\u201d), which makes it illegal, inter alia, for an owner to fail to confine his or her dog and which is graded a misdemeanor of the third degree, is an absolute liability offense. 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-305(a)(l). For the reasons that follow, we would find that it is not an absolute liability offense, but, rather, that the Commonwealth must establish that the accused acted intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, 18 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 302(c), and so we would reverse the determination of the Superior Court.\nThe underlying facts of this dispute, as found by the trial court, are as follows. On July 7, 2009 at approximately 7:15 p.m., \u201cMuncy,\u201d Appellant Simon Raban\u2019s black giant schnauzer, which was not restrained by a leash or electric fence collar, left Appellant\u2019s premises, crossed Barrington Road in Chester Springs, Pennsylvania, and attacked a Bernese mountain dog named \u201cHubble.\u201d Hubble and his owner, Austin Alvin, were walking on the opposite side of the street in front of Appellant\u2019s residence when Muncy approached and grabbed Hubble by the neck. While Alvin reported that Hubble limped after the incident, the dog did not sustain any long-term injury. Approximately 10 to 15 minutes after the events occurred, a neighbor, George Sawicki, observed Appellant place an electric fence collar on Muncy\u2019s neck.\nThe West Vincent Township Police Department responded to a call concerning the matter, and Appellant was issued a citation pursuant to Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law. Five months earlier, as stipulated to by the parties, Appellant had been convicted of a violation of Section 305(a)(1) for failing to properly confine his dog. Following a bench trial in the instant case, the Court of Common Pleas of Chester County found Appellant guilty of a second violation of Section 305(a)(1), a misdemeanor of the third degree, 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-903(b)(2), and sentenced him to six months of non-reporting probation and a $500 fine. In so doing, the trial judge determined that, because Section 305 imposed absolute liability for a violation of the statute, the Commonwealth was not required to establish evidence of Appellant\u2019s intent or knowledge. Trial Court Opinion, 2/2/2011, at 3, 7. Appellant appealed his conviction.\nIn a unanimous, published opinion, a three judge panel of the Superior Court affirmed Appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence. Commonwealth v. Raban, 31 A.3d 699 (Pa.Super.2011). Before the court, Appellant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court erroneously interpreted Section 305(a)(1) to have no culpability requirement, improperly rendering Appellant absolutely liable for the violation. The Superior Court, after reviewing prior case law from both the Commonwealth Court and the Superior Court, affirmed the trial court\u2019s conclusion that scienter was not an element of the offense.\nSpecifically, the Superior Court reviewed Baehr v. Commonwealth ex rel. Lower Merion Twp., 51 Pa.Cmwlth. 241, 414 A.2d 415 (1980), which interpreted former Section 702 of the Dog Law, the identically-worded predecessor to Section 305(a)(1), and found that the mandatory nature of the offense and the predominating concern for public safety, as well as the difficulty in establishing culpability, led to the conclusion that Section 305 imposed absolute liability. Similarly, the Superior Court also relied upon its own subsequent decision in Commonwealth v. Glumac, 717 A.2d 572 (Pa.Super.1998), wherein the court stressed that the purpose behind Section 305 was to require dog owners to prevent their dogs from roaming the streets, and that the protection of the public\u2019s health and safety is best attained when dogs are secured or accompanied when not confined.\nBased upon Baehr, as well as Glumac, the Superior Court in this matter reasoned that the legislative intent under Section 305 favored the interest in protecting the public from roving dogs. According to the court, the plain language of the statute mandated that it \u201cshall be unlawful\u201d to fail to keep at all times one\u2019s dog within the confines of one\u2019s premises. Therefore, the court opined that the mandate to confine one\u2019s dog was stated absolutely, and not in terms of reasonable care, which, in its view, would complicate the ascertainment of culpability, and frustrate the legislative intent. Thus, the Superior Court affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding that there was no scienter element in Section 305(a)(1).\nThis Court granted allocatur to determine whether Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law is an absolute liability offense. As the issue before us is a pure question of law, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review plenary. Buffalo Twp. v. Jones, 571 Pa. 637, 813 A.2d 659, 664 n. 4 (2002).\nSection 305 of the Dog Law makes it illegal for an owner to, inter alia, fail to confine his or her dog, and provides:\nIt shall be unlawful for the owner or keeper of any dog to fail to keep at all times the dog in any of the following manners:\n(1) confined within the premises of the owner;\n(2) firmly secured by means of a collar and chain or other device so that it cannot stray beyond the premises on which it is secured; or\n(3) under the reasonable control of some person, or when engaged in lawful hunting, exhibition, performance events or field training.\n3 P.S. \u00a7 459-305(a).\nAppellant argues that the Superior Court erroneously concluded that Section 305(a)(1) is an absolute liability offense. According to Appellant, absolute liability crimes are problematic in that they \u201ccan lead to absurd, unreasonable, cruel, unusual, unjust, or bizarre consequences,\u201d Brief of Appellant at 8, offering a hypothetical in which a person could be found in violation of Section 305(a) if a burglar breaks into an individual\u2019s home, and the dog, while chasing the intruder, escapes confinement. Appellant submits that, if the reason as to why a dog was not restrained is irrelevant, it will lead to an absurd result that the General Assembly did not intend. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1922. Appellant also challenges the Superior Court\u2019s proffered reason that it would be difficult to establish culpability in the absence of absolute liability, asserting that, while the mandate to confine a dog is stated in absolute terms, convenience of investigation and prosecution is not the primary inquiry in ascertaining the elements of an offense, citing Commonwealth v. Barone, 276 Pa.Super. 282, 419 A.2d 457 (1980). Appellant adds that absolute liability offenses are disfavored, and, absent a clear indication by the legislature to eliminate a mens rea requirement, should not be so construed. Commonwealth v. Gallagher, 592 Pa. 262, 924 A.2d 636, 638-39 (2007). According to Appellant, the Superior Court turned this presumption on its head, determining that, because the statute is silent, the General Assembly intended that this be an absolute liability crime. Thus, Appellant seeks a new trial.\nThe Commonwealth responds that it is accepted that the legislature may impose absolute liability for \u201cpublic welfare offenses\u201d to enhance the common weal. Brief of Commonwealth at 7. According to the Commonwealth, the imposition of absolute liability is appropriate as the penalties for such regulatory offenses are generally minimal. The Commonwealth argues that the language of the statute is clear and that the legislature intended to \u201cremove evidence of a dog\u2019s history or propensity to attack as criteria under the section, therefore imposing absolute criminal liability for any unprovoked attack.\u201d Brief of Commonwealth at 10. The Commonwealth asserts that the Superior Court properly determined, relying on Glumac and Baehr, that the intent of the General Assembly was to favor the public interest in preventing roving dogs, which supports the conclusion that Section 305(a)(1) imposes strict liability. According to the Commonwealth, the omission of terms such as \u201cknowingly\u201d or \u201cwillfully\u201d is significant and indicates a legislative intent to impose absolute liability.\nEven if it is ambiguous whether there is a culpability requirement in Section 305, the Commonwealth offers that requiring owners to confine their dogs coincides with the General Assembly\u2019s goal of minimizing safety risks to dogs and innocent bystanders. Finally, the Commonwealth refutes Appellant\u2019s assertion that to impose absolute liability would lead to an absurd result, as Appellant\u2019s hypothetical involves the intervention of a third party, which would constitute a defense to the crime, and, here, according to the Commonwealth, the absurdity doctrine is inapplicable because the statute is intended to promote the public welfare by enforcing compliance through the regulation of the confinement of dogs.\nWe begin our analysis by noting that, historically, common law crimes have required that defendant\u2019s actions be accompanied by some type of fault or bad intent. See Wayne R. LaFave, Criminal Law 288 (5th ed. 2010). Wrongful intent is usually an element of a crime, this concept being part of the fundamental concept of mens rea. Commonwealth v. Samuels, 566 Pa. 109, 778 A.2d 638, 642 (2001) (Saylor, J. concurring). Mens rea generally connotes a guilty mind, or a wrongful purpose. Id. By contrast, \u201c[c]riminal liability in the absence of intention, belief, recklessness or negligence is generally termed strict or absolute liability.\u201d Id. (citing 87 J.Crim. L. & Criminology 1075, 1080 (Summer 1997)). Because of the traditional requirement of mens rea, i.e., culpability and condemnation, absolute liability offenses are not favored. Samuels, 778 A.2d at 643; Gallagher, 924 A.2d at 639 (opining that absolute liability crimes are \u201cgenerally disfavored and an offense will not be considered to impose absolute liability absent some indication of a legislative directive to dispense with mens rea.\u201d)) Commonwealth v. Mayfield, 574 Pa. 460, 832 A.2d 418, 426 (2003); Staples v. United States, 511 U.S. 600, 605-06, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994). Indeed, there \u201cis a long-standing tradition ... that criminal liability is not to be imposed absent some level of culpability.\u201d Gallagher, 924 A.2d at 639.\nGenerally, the question of whether there is a culpability requirement for a statutory offense is a matter of construction to be determined by the language of the statute, in light of its manifest purpose and design. Commonwealth v. Ludwig, 583 Pa. 6, 874 A.2d 623, 630 (2005); Commonwealth v. Weiss, 139 Pa. 247, 21 A. 10, 10 (1891). As our analysis involves the interpretation of a statute, we necessarily begin by considering the Statutory Construction Act (\u201cSCA\u201d). 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1501 et seq. The object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a). The best indication of the legislature\u2019s intent is the plain language of the statute. When the words of a statute are clear and unambiguous, we may not go beyond the plain meaning of the language of the statute under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. Id. \u00a7 1921(b). Only when the words of the statute are ambiguous should a reviewing court seek to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly through considerations of the various factors found in Section 1921(c) of the SCA. Id. \u00a7 1921(c); Bayada Nurses, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t. of Labor and Indus., 607 Pa. 527, 8 A.3d 866, 880-81 (2010). Concomitant with these principles, the SCA and our case law provide for other presumptions to be applied when discerning the intent of the General Assembly. Specifically, the legislature does not intend a result that is unreasonable, absurd, or impossible of execution. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1922(1). Moreover, since Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law is a penal statute, it must be strictly construed. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1928(b)(1).\nWith these principles in hand, we first consider the statutory language at issue. As noted above, Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law provides that it \u201cshall be unlawful for the owner or keeper of any dog to fail to keep at all times the dog ... confined within the premises of the owner.\u201d 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-305(a)(1). Importantly for purposes of this appeal, for a first time violation, the defendant shall be deemed to be guilty of a summary offense. 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-903(b)(l). For a second violation which occurs within one year of sentencing for the first violation, the individual shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree. 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-903(b)(2).\nSection 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law does not expressly provide a culpability element, and, therefore, is subject to further inquiry to determine whether the General Assembly intended a violation thereof to be an absolute liability offense. Generally speaking, Section 302 of the Crimes Code provides minimum culpability provisions in order to uphold a conviction for criminal offenses, and, specifically, Section 302(c) provides certain culpability requirements when such culpability is not otherwise prescribed by law. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 302(c). However, for certain offenses, before Section 302 is implicated, another more directly controlling section of the Crimes Code must be considered. Specifically, Section 302 is made inapplicable to certain offenses pursuant to Section 305 of the Crimes Code, which concerns further limitations on the scope of culpability requirements, and, thus, absolute liability. Therefore, we turn to an examination of Section 305 of the Crimes Code.\nSection 305(a) of the Crimes Code provides that the minimum culpability requirements provided in Section 302 of the Crimes Code do not apply to summary offenses and certain offenses defined by other statutes. Specifically, Section 305(a) states:\n(a) When culpability requirements are inapplicable to summary offenses and to offenses defined by other statutes. \u2014 The requirements of culpability prescribed by section 301 of this title (relating to requirement of voluntary act) and section 302 of this title (relating to general requirements of culpability) do not apply to:\n(1) summary offenses, unless the requirement involved is included in the definition of the offense or the court determines that its application is consistent with effective enforcement of the law defining the offense; or\n(2) offenses defined by statutes other than this title, in so far as a legislative purpose to impose absolute liability for such offenses or with respect to any material element thereof plainly appears.\n18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 305(a)(1), (2).\nSubsection (a)(1) is directed to summary offenses. Under that subsection, when a summary offense is silent regarding a culpability requirement, the General Assembly itself has provided that culpability requirements are inapplicable for such offenses (unless defined otherwise or a court determines the application of Section 302 is consistent with effective law enforcement), and, thus, has rendered these offenses to be of absolute liability in nature.\nAppellant, however, was not charged or convicted of a summary offense. Rather, Appellant was charged with a second violation of Section 305 of the Dog Law which is graded as a misdemeanor of the third degree, 3 P.S. 459-903(b)(2), and which carries with it possible imprisonment for up to one year. Thus, Section 305(a)(2) is triggered herein as it concerns non-summary violations defined by statutes other than the Crimes Code, which includes the Dog Law. Under subsection (a)(2), the generally-applied culpability requirements found in Section 302 of the Crimes Code are inapplicable, and, thus, the offenses impose absolute liability, only where the legislature\u2019s intent to impose absolute liability \u201cplainly appears.\u201d\nTherefore, we turn to analyze whether it \u201cplainly appears\u201d that the legislature intended to impose absolute liability for establishing a second violation of Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law, an offense punishable for up to one year imprisonment. Of course, if the culpability requirement, or lack thereof, was explicit, there would be no need to engage in this exercise. By the terms of Section 305(a)(2) of the Crimes Code, in exploring whether the legislature\u2019s intent \u201cplainly appears,\u201d we look to see if the intent is clear and obvious. Thus, governed by the limiting language contained in Section 305(a)(2) \u2014 requiring that the legislative intent \u201cplainly appears\u201d \u2014 our analysis allows us to discern the General Assembly\u2019s intent from something less than an express or explicit statement that the offense imposes absolute liability, but nevertheless requires an expression of legislative intent that is more definite than may be possibly gleaned after a statutory construction analysis employing secondary inferential considerations.\nWhile Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law speaks in somewhat obligatory terms \u2014 \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for the owner or keeper of any dog to fail to keep at all times\u201d the dog, confined, secured, or under reasonable control, 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-305(a) \u2014 this mandate does not necessarily equate to an intent to impose absolute liability. Indeed, the statutory language concerning a violation if an owner \u201cfail[s]\u201d to confine his or her dog on the premises could suggest an assessment of reasonableness of action taken to confine a dog, implying a culpability component. In any event, these competing possibilities indicate that an intent to make the offense one of absolute liability certainly does not, in our view, \u201cplainly appear.\u201d Moreover, as noted above, we are mindful that absolute liability crimes are disfavored, and Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law is a penal statute that must be strictly construed. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1928(b)(1).\nThus, in light of the language of Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law, as well as the context in which we must view that language, we conclude that it does not \u201cplainly appear\u201d that the General Assembly intended for a second violation of Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law to be an absolute liability offense. Simply stated, if the legislature sought to have Section 305(a)(1) \u201cplainly appear\u201d to impose absolute liability, the language it employed in drafting the statute lacks the definiteness to accomplish that goal.\nAs we find it does not \u201cplainly appear\u201d that the legislature intended to render the culpability requirements in 18 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 302(c) inapplicable to a second violation of Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law, we return our focus to Section 302 to consider what culpability requirement is applicable to a second violation of the statute. Pursuant to Section 302(c), when no culpability is prescribed by law, the culpability element is established if the defendant acts \u201cintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly with respect thereto.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 302(c). Thus, to establish a second violation of Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law, a misdemeanor of the third degree, the Commonwealth is required to establish that the owner or keeper acted at least recklessly to sustain a conviction.,\nIn light of the issue on which this Court granted allocatur, we would reverse the determination of the Superior Court and remand to the Superior Court, to remand to the trial court, for further proceedings consistent with our opinion today.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nJustices SAYLOR and McCAFFERY join this Opinion in Support of Reversal.\n. The parties stipulated appellant was convicted within the past year of violating \u00a7 305(a)(1).\n. See id., \u00a7 459-903(b)(2).\n. Appellant posits examples where owners whose dogs are unconfined due to home burglary, assault while walking the dog, and other like circumstances could be found guilty for failure to confine if \u00a7 305(a)(1) were interpreted as an absolute liability offense.\n. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 305(a)(2), discussed infra.\n. The OISR contends this example \"actually sharpens [its] point[,]\u201d and references the law applicable to \"exotic wildlife,\u201d which includes tigers. Id., at 478 n. 7 (citing 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2961, 2963). The OISR highlights, \"while the classic law school illustration may impose absolute liability on the keeper of a tiger, Pennsylvania law ... [requires] the Commonwealth [to] establish that the possessor of a ... tiger[ ] has failed to exercise due care, or was reckless, before imposing criminal liability[.]\u201d Id. This, the OISR asserts, \"supports [its] finding that a violation of [\u00a7 ] 305 regarding a failure to confine a domesticated dog should not be interpreted as an absolute liability offense.\u201d Id. However, the OISR fails to address the obvious distinctions between the dog law at issue and the exotic wildlife statute, which imposes criminal liability for \"[f]ail[ing] to exercise due care in safeguarding the public from attack by exotic wildlife\u201d or \"[r]ecklessly engaging] in conduct which places or may place another person in danger of attack by exotic wildlife.\u201d 34 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2963(c)(3)-(4) (emphasis added). These statutory subsections prescribe a culpability element and, contrary to the OISR\u2019s contention, do not expressly condone the failure to confine, but rather concern whether adequate precautions were taken to prevent attack.\n. Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \"permit\u201d as \"to allow (something) to happen[,] to give permission for (something)L] to allow (someone) to do or have something[, or] to make something possible[.]\u201d Merriam-Webster, www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/permit (last visited December 17, 2013).\n. Webster's Dictionary defines \"fail\u201d as \"to not succeed[,] to end without success!,] ... to not do (something that you should do or are expected to do)[.]\u201d Merriam-Webster, www.merriam-webster.com/ dictionary/fail (last visited December 17, 2013). It does not imply or suggest a \"culpability requirement.\u201d\n. It is worth noting that the elements of \u00a7 305(a)(1) do not change at all for a misdemeanor. The change in grading is in \u00a7 903(b)(l)-(2), and the difference concerns prior offenses, not intent. See 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-903(b)(1) \u2014 (2).\n. Act of December 7, 1982, P.L. 784, No. 225, art. Ill, \u00a7 305, effective January 1, 1983, as amended, 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-305.\n. Section 903(b)(1) provides: \"Unless otherwise provided under this act, a person who violates a provision of Articles II through Article VII or a rule or regulation adopted or order issued under this act commits the following: (1) For the first offense, a summary offense and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced for each offense to pay a fine of not less than $100 nor more than $500 or to imprisonment for not more than 90 days, or both.\"\n. Section 903(b)(2) provides: \"For a subsequent offense that occurs within one year of sentencing, for the prior violation, a misdemeanor of the third degree and shall, upon conviction, be sentenced for each offense to pay a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 plus costs of prosecution or to imprisonment of not more than one year, or both.\u201d\n. Pennsylvania\u2019s limitations on culpability requirements are derived from Section 2.05 of the Model Penal Code. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 305, Official Comment-1972. The Model Penal Code provides that default culpability provisions do not apply to \"violations\u201d \u2014 offenses which are not crimes and which did not result in a sentence of probation or imprisonment. See Model Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 1.04(5), 6.02(4). Significantly, however, the Pennsylvania legislature replaced the concept of \"violations\u201d under the Model Penal Code, with \"summary offenses.\u201d Therefore, while absolute liability remains limited in scope, pursuant to Section 305 of the Crimes Code, such absolute liability offenses may be punishable with imprisonment up to 90 days, as a general rule. See generally, Samuels, 778 A.2d at 646 (Saylor, J. concurring).\n. See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1001 (1981) (defining \"plain\u201d as \"Free from obstructions; open to view; clear\u201d); Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 871 (1980) (defining \"plain\u201d as \"evident to the mind or senses,\u201d \"obvious,\u201d and \u201cclear\u201d).\n. This approach dovetails with the SCA, which requires us to initially discern legislative intent from the language of the statute itself when the language is clear and unambiguous, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(b), but limits consideration of the various factors found in Section 1921(c) of the SCA, to when the words of the statute are ambiguous. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(c).\n. Justice Eakin in his Opinion in Support of Affirmance offers that the term \"fails\u201d renders the statute unambiguous, and that the General Assembly intended to impose absolute criminal liability for a second conviction for failing to keep one\u2019s dog confined. Opinion in Support of Affirmance (Eakin, J.) at 469-70. Justice Eakin contrasts this with Section 504-A of the Dog Law, 3 P.S. \u00a7 459-504-A, regarding dangerous dogs, and its use of the term \"permit,\u201d which in his view \"clearly involv[es] an intent element.\u201d Id. at 471. In our view, Justice Eakin\u2019s distinction between these terms is overstated, as both \"permitting\u201d and \"failing\u201d suggest at least a degree of culpability. Moreover, the term \"fail\u201d is not as categorical in meaning as suggested by Justice Eakin, as other statutes containing such language have not been deemed to be absolute liability crimes. See Commonwealth v. Bready, 220 Pa.Super. 157, 286 A.2d 654, 656-57 (1971) (concluding statute imposing criminal liability on magistrate \"who shall fail to\u201d make monthly reports did not impose strict liability). Also, notably absent from Justice Eakin's analysis is any recognition that our statutory construction be performed through the lens that it \"plainly appear\u201d the legislature intended to impose strict liability on dog owners or that the law disfavors absolute liability crimes.\nFurthermore, Justice Eakin\u2019s analogy to the keeping of a tiger imposing absolute liability actually sharpens our point. Under the Game and Wildlife Code, a tiger is defined as an \"exotic wildlife,\u201d which, in addition to tigers, includes, inter alia, lions, cheetahs, cougars, and bears. 34 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2961. Possession of such exotic wildlife requires a permit. Id. at \u00a7 2963. A possessor of such wildlife may be criminally liable if he or she \u201cfail[s] to exercise due care in safeguarding the public from attack by exotic wildlife\u201d or \"[rjecklessly engage[s] in conduct which places or may place another person in danger of attack by exotic wildlife.\u201d 34 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2963(c)(3), (4). Thus, while the classic law school illustration may impose absolute liability on the keeper of a tiger, Pennsylvania law does not. That the Commonwealth must establish that the possessor of a wild animal, such as a tiger, has failed to exercise due care, or was reckless, before imposing criminal liability, supports our finding that a violation of Section 305 regarding a failure to confine a domesticated dog should not be interpreted as an absolute liability offense. Indeed, it would, in our view, be absurd to impose absolute liability on a pet owner who fails to confine his or her dog, but not upon one who fails to confine his or her lion, tiger, or bear. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1922. Finally, Justice Eakin's analogy to speeding, while having visceral appeal, is similarly problematic, as the Motor Vehicle Code provision involving maximum speed limits mandates that \"no person shall drive a vehicle at a speed in excess of\" a maximum limit, 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3362, arguably a more unqualified command than a failure to confine.\n. We acknowledge the oddity of a first violation of Section 305(a)(1) of the Dog Law being an absolute liability offense, but, despite the same language, a second violation requiring at least a showing of recklessness. Yet, as explained above, Section 305 of the Crimes Code, by its terms, mandates this result. Moreover, in light of the significant prison term for conviction of a second violation, this approach is in keeping with the legislature's mandate to \" 'tone down\u2019 absolute or strict liability in penal law as a whole,\u201d where such application of absolute liability \"cannot be readily defended where the offense carries a possible jail sentence.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 305, official cmt.\n. Contrary to Chief Justice Castille\u2019s concern that our interpretation \"effectively neuters the statute,\u201d Opinion in Support of Affirmance (Castille, J.) at 472, we are confident that the Commonwealth would not be handicapped by the requirement of proving recklessness, and would be able to meet its burden with circumstantial evidence, just as it does in numerous other areas of criminal law, and, indeed, as noted above, is required to do so under the Game and Wildlife Code. See supra note 7."}
