{"id": "1253640", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThe basic controversy is whether or not Richard G. Rogers, son of Sue G. Rogers, the testatrix, received approximately $10,900.00 from his mother, in her lifetime, with directions from her to place it in her safe deposit box to which he had joint access. Apparently this the son failed to do. As executor of his mother\u2019s estate he has not included such sum in his inventory and appraisement. Under the will testatrix\u2019s son, appellant, was devised and bequeathed the entire estate and was named the sole executor. Testatrix\u2019s husband, Dr. Charles A. Rogers, appellee, survived and elected to take against the will. He filed exceptions to the inventory and appraisement upon the ground that the executor should have charged himself with the fund above mentioned. The son filed an answer denying \u201cthat he owes the said estate approximately Eleven thousand ($11,000.00) Dollars\u201d and demanded a jury trial. After a hearing the orphans\u2019 court granted an issue to be tried by a jury. The son has appealed.\nIn the settlement of a decedent\u2019s estate disputed title to property should not be determined upon exceptions to an inventory and appraisement which happens not to include the property claimed on behalf of the estate. The function and object of an inventory and appraisement in a decedent\u2019s estate is to fix presumptively the existence of property in the possession of the fiduciary and the value thereof. This is only prima facie evidence of ownership and value. Such listing does not affect the true Ownership and value: Stewart\u2019s Estate, 137 Pa. 175, 20 A. 554; Moore\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 211 Pa. 338, 60 A. 987; Hermann\u2019s Estate, 226 Pa. 543, 75 A. 731; Fleming\u2019s Estate, 10 Dist. 259 (Penrose, J.). The question of ownership is of interest to creditors, federal and state taxing authorities, and others. Such title, therefore, should not be finally determined' until after an audit, with due statutory notice, and the determination by the orphans\u2019 court whether or not a substantial issue of fact exists. It is true that in Leadenham\u2019s Estate, 289 Pa. 216, 137 A. 247, a citation on the fiduciary to file a supplemental inventory embracing the disputed property was impliedly approved as a procedure for determining the question of title. Nonetheless, the proper procedure is as we have hereinabove indicated and is, therefore, to be followed.\nThe executor, appellant, should be required to file an account. At the audit a claim for surcharge may then be presented against the fiduciary for the amount of money which belonged to decedent at the time of her decease and alleged to be in his possession.\nThere is testimony in this record that the money in question was handed to the son by the decedent, with direction to place it in her safe deposit box, which he did not do. No evidence was presented by the son denying the foregoing testimony, nor was a claim made by him of a gift or other ownership. If at the audit of the account it should appear that the appellant holds this fund merely as custodian for the estate, the court will direct that it be placed in the fiduciary\u2019s account for distribution. Should, however, the son deny ever receiving such money or, having received it, claim that he disbursed it in accordance with testatrix\u2019s direction or should the son claim it as a gift, the court shall proceed to ascertain if a substantial dispute exists. If it does, then the. executor, as an individual, has the undoubted right to demand and secure the award of an issue to' be tried by..a. jury... Even in the absence of demand, where a substantial, dispute .exists, it is' the duty of the court to award .an issue: Cutler\u2019s Estate, 225 Pa. 167, 73 A. 1111; Williams\u2019 Estate, 236 Pa. 259, 84 A. 848; Schroeder Estate, 352 Pa. 170, 42 A. 2d 617; Colison Estate, 356 Pa. 531, 52 A. 2d 184; Perri v. Chiavaroli, 370 Pa. 495, 499, 88 A. 2d 798.\nUnder the Act of August 10, 1951, P. L. 1163, Art. VII, Sec. 745 (b), 20 PS 2080.745 (b), which codified the prior law, it is provided: \u201cWhen a substantial dispute of fact shall arise concerning the decedent\u2019s title to property, real or personal, any party in interest shall be entitled to a trial of this fact by a jury.\u201d (Italics supplied)\nThe order is reversed and the record remanded to the court below to proceed as herein directed. Costs to abide the event."}
