{"id": "12278269", "contents": "OPINION\nJUSTICE DONOHUE\nIn June 2015, Marcel Emanuel Johnson (\u201cJohnson\u201d) was convicted of killing Ebony Talley (\u201cTalley\u201d), her unborn child, and her four-year-old daughter, R.R. He was sentenced to death for R.R.\u2019s murder. In this automatic direct appeal, Johnson raises nine issues for our review. Following our thorough consideration of these issues and for the reasons set forth below, we affirm his convictions and the imposition of the death sentence.\nIn November 2013, Talley was living in Apartment 604 of the Avalon Court Apartments in Bristol Township, Bucks County with R.R, Early in the afternoon of November 25, 2013, Talley\u2019s mother and sisters arrived at Avalon Court to visit. Talley, who was twenty weeks pregnant, and her mother left briefly to obtain a money order for a partial amount of Talley\u2019s rent. Upon their return, Johnson arrived at the apartment. Johnson and Talley were friends and he was well acquainted with her visiting family members. Johnson was storing some of his belongings in the apartment and Talley occasionally allowed him to stay overnight. Johnson socialized with Talley and her family that afternoon. When Talley\u2019s mother and sisters left at approximately 2:30 p.m., Johnson remained.\nShortly thereafter, around 3:00 p.m,, a fire was detected in Talley\u2019s apartment. The fire emitted a thick, black smoke that made it difficult for the responding firefighters to gain entry. Once inside, firefighters discovered Talley\u2019s lifeless body in the bedroom. Talley was lying face-down with numerous stab wounds to her head, neck and body. A plastic bag was also wrapped tightly around her head. Small, empty yellow wax bags stamped in red ink with \u201c# 1 way to go\u201d were found scattered around Talley\u2019s body. More of these distinctive empty wax bags were found in a shoebox in the bedroom. In the living room, the firefighters found an unresponsive R.R. in a pool of blood beneath an overturned couch. R.R. had been stabbed in the chest and bled profusely. She was rushed to the hospital, but pronounced dead soon after her arrival. Minutes before the fire was detected, a resident of Avalon Court observed Talley\u2019s vehicle speed out of the parking lot, hitting another vehicle in its haste. The resident noticed that vehicle was being driven by a black male.\nWhile emergency responders were still at the scene of the fire, Johnson placed a series of calls to Talley\u2019s cousin, Brittany Coles. Ms. Coles, who had been alerted to what was happening at Talley\u2019s apartment and was in a frantic state, told Johnson about the fire. Because she was at work and could not leave, she implored Johnson to return to the apartment complex to obtain more information. Johnson refused, explaining that he wanted to avoid the police because there were outstanding warrants for his arrest. Later that afternoon, Johnson called Talley\u2019s sister, Paulina Burke. Ms. Burke informed Johnson that both Talley and R.R. had died. She asked Johnson to turn Talley\u2019s vehicle over to the police and otherwise aid in the police investigation. Again, Johnson refused, citing the outstanding warrants as the basis for his refusal.\nIn these phone conversations, Johnson indicated that he was calling from a friend\u2019s home in the Levittown Trace Apartment complex. Based on this information, the police proceeded to the Levittown Trace Apartments at approximately 6:00 p.m. and located Talley\u2019s vehicle in the most remote portion of the apartment complex\u2019s parking lot. When the police approached the vehicle, they found it was vacant. They also noticed that the license plate had been changed, but the VIN number, which is visible through the windshield, verified that it was Talley\u2019s vehicle. Shortly after 7:00 p.m., Johnson entered the vehicle and began to leave the parking lot. The police immediately stopped him, utilizing a \u201cfelony stop\u201d procedure. During a felony stop, the police officers remain shielded by their vehicles and, with weapons drawn, they instruct the motorist to exit his car, demonstrate that he does not possess a weapon, and lay on the ground before they approach. The police then transported Johnson to their headquarters for questioning. A subsequent search of Talley\u2019s vehicle revealed, among other items, a bundle of eight empty wax packets stamped in red with \u201c# 1 way to go,\u201d in the ash tray. These packets were identical to the packets found around Talley\u2019s body and in her bedroom.\nAt the police station, Johnson waived his Miranda rights and agreed to speak with investigators. He explained his friendship with Talley and acknowledged that he was at her apartment earlier that day. He stated that he left Talley\u2019s home on foot and met up with a friend named Eric Stahl, who was driving Talley\u2019s vehicle, and that Stahl gave him the keys later that day. After being confronted with evidence that conflicted with this account, Johnson changed his story and admitted both to taking Talley\u2019s car and her Xbox gaming system and hitting another vehicle as he did. When asked why he did not come to the scene of the fire or the police station at Talley\u2019s family\u2019s requests, he reiterated his concern about the arrest warrants. The police arrested Johnson that evening on charges of possession of drug paraphernalia based on items found in his possession when the police stopped him in Talley\u2019s vehicle. That night, while he was in custody, the police obtained and executed a warrant for samples of Johnson\u2019s DNA, fingernail scrapings, hair samples and clothes.\nIn January 2014, Johnson was charged with the murders of Talley, R.R., Talley\u2019s unborn child and related crimes. While detained in the Bucks County Correctional Facility, Johnson admitted to another inmate that he killed Talley and that he killed R.R. because she could identify him as her mother\u2019s killer. Also while incarcerated, Johnson phoned his brother, Marquis Johnson, and told him that he hid \u201cevidence\u201d in a precise location at the Levittown Trace Apartments and asked him to retrieve it, admonishing that the items should never see the light of day. Marquis did as his brother requested and retrieved a blue plastic glove containing 167 packets of heroin, all in wax packets stamped in red with \u201c# 1 way to go,\u201d and a money order for eighty dollars.\nA jury trial commenced in May 2015, at the conclusion of which Johnson was convicted of the first-degree murders of both Talley and R.R., third-degree murder of Talley\u2019s unborn child, arson (endangering people), and possessing instruments of crime. During the penalty phase, the Commonwealth presented evidence of four aggravating factors as to Talley: torture; conviction of another murder at the same time of Talley\u2019s murder; involvement in the sale of narcotics at the time of the murder; and knowledge of Talley\u2019s pregnancy. N.T., 6/8/2015, at 192-95. The Commonwealth pursued three aggravating factors with regard to R.R.: that R.R. was a witness to a murder and was killed to prevent her from testifying; conviction of another murder at the same time as R.R.\u2019s murder; and that R.R. was less than twelve years old. Id. at 197-200.\nJohnson presented evidence in support of four mitigating factors: his lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions; extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the murders; and the fact that he was twenty-one at the time of the murders. Id. at 200. Johnson also presented an assemblage of evidence under the catchall mitigating factor, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8), including evidence that Johnson\u2019s life up until the time of the murders was characterized by chronic and pervasive abuse, neglect and abandonment; that he suffered brain damage and had been diagnosed with various mental illnesses; cycles of placement in and out of treatment programs; and a complete lack of any semblance of stability or permanence. The jury ultimately sentenced Johnson to death for R.R.\u2019s murder and life in prison for Talley\u2019s murder.\nThe trial court denied Johnson\u2019s post-sentence motions, after which Johnson filed this timely appeal. He presents several issues for our review, challenging the denial of his motions to suppress, evidentiary rulings, the sufficiency of the evidence, the trial court\u2019s refusal to allow Johnson to present certain mitigating evidence, the trial court\u2019s jury instruction during the penalty phase, the denial of his motion to preclude the Commonwealth from seeking the death penalty, and the constitutionality of the three statutory aggravating factors presented by the Commonwealth in connection with R.R.\u2019s murder.\nI. Sufficiency of the Evidence\nIn all death penalty cases, this Court reviews the sufficiency of the evidence to ensure that it supports the verdicts of first-degree murder, whether or not the appellant raises the issue. Commonwealth v. May, 584 Pa. 640, 887 A.2d 750, 753 (2005). When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider whether the evidence presented at trial, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, when viewed in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner, support the jury\u2019s verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Patterson, 625 Pa. 104, 91 A.3d 55, 66 (2014). The determination of whether sufficient evidence exists to support the verdict is a question of law; accordingly, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Id.\nTo establish first-degree murder, the Commonwealth must prove that a human being was unlawfully killed, the defendant perpetrated the killing, and the defendant acted with malice and a specific intent to kill. Id. \u201cSpecific intent to kill may be inferred by the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body, and the Commonwealth may prove the specific intent to kill necessary for first-degree murder wholly through circumstantial evidence.\u201d Id.\nThe evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, establishes these elements beyond a reasonable doubt. To begin, Johnson admitted to killing both Talley and R.R., thereby establishing that they were unlawfully killed and that Johnson killed them. In his confession, he stated that Talley \u201cmade [him] kill her[,]\u201d and acknowledged killing R.R. so that she could not identify him as her mother\u2019s killer N.T., 6/1/2015, at 230, 233-35.\nSubstantial evidence also demonstrated that both victims were killed by the use of a deadly weapon on vital parts of the victims\u2019 bodies. Dr. Ian Hood, a forensic pathologist, testified that Talley suffered thirty-five stab wounds to her head, neck, chest and abdomen. N.T., 5/28/2016, at 205. One wound perforated the common carotid artery in her neck and two others entered her chest cavity, causing a collapsed lung and internal bleeding. Id. at 206-08. While Talley was incapacitated from blood loss, a plastic bag was secured over her head, \u201cproviding terminal asphyxia as a final mechanism of death[.]\u201d Id. at 232. R.R. was stabbed in the upper chest, just below her collarbone. Id. at 194-95.\nThere was also circumstantial evidence of Johnson\u2019s guilt. Talley\u2019s mother and sister testified that when they left Talley\u2019s home, Johnson remained in the apartment with Talley and R.R. N.T., 5/28/2015, at 271; N.T., 5/27/2016, at 112. Fires were set on or immediately beside the incapacitated Talley and R.R., N.T., 5/27/2015, at 186-88, and were discovered approximately half an hour after Talley\u2019s mother and sister left, just minutes after Johnson was observed fleeing the scene at a high rate of speed in Talley\u2019s vehicle. N.T., 5/29/2015, at 300. This evidence, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, places Johnson in the apartment at the relevant time. Moreover, Talley\u2019s DNA was found under Johnson\u2019s fingernails, which, according to expert testimony, was not the result of casual contact with Talley. Id. at 186-87. Dr. Hood testified that Talley\u2019s body bore multiple defensive wounds and that the relatively shallow depth of many of the stab wounds was the result of Talley\u2019s struggle against her assailant. N.T., 5/28/2015, at 205, 210. Johnson was observed to have recent lacerations on his hands and fingers just a few hours after the murders, and he had changed his clothes. N.T., 5/29/2015, at 233, 237-38.\nJohnson raises a single challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, claiming that it is insufficient to establish that he was the person who killed Talley and R.R. and set the apartment on fire. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 37. Notably, Johnson does not dispute the evidence detailed above. Instead, he directs our attention to other evidence. For instance, Johnson acknowledges that he fled Talley\u2019s apartment complex in a hurry, but argues that flight alone does not establish guilt. Id. at 38. He suggests that other people involved in the drug trade could have wanted to harm Talley, and presents an alternative scenario in which he arrived at the apartment only to find that it had been set on fire and fled in a panic. Id. at 38-39. He also points to the lack of blood found on his clothes and body, that his blood was not found in Talley\u2019s apartment, and that his DNA was not found on Talley. Id. at 39-40.\nThese alleged deficiencies of physical evidence were, however, offset by other evidence. For example, although Johnson points to the lack of blood on his clothing, there was testimony that Johnson changed his clothes between the time of Talley\u2019s family\u2019s visit and his apprehension by the police a few hours later. N.T., 5/27/2015, at 113; N.T., 5/29/2015, at 41. Likewise, Johnson\u2019s focus on the absence of incriminating blood or DNA at the scene of the crime may be explained by testimony from a Commonwealth witness that the blood and DNA samples recovered from Talley\u2019s apartment proved to be unsuitable for testing. N.T., 5/29/2015, at 122-126.\nMore importantly, Johnson does not genuinely contest that the evidence presented by the Commonwealth, when viewed in the light most favorable to it, was legally sufficient to prove his guilt. Instead, his arguments seek to vitiate the weight of the evidence supporting his convictions and to undermine the credibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. Seen in this light, Johnson\u2019s arguments are addressed to the weight of the evidence supporting his convictions, not the sufficiency of the evidence. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gibbs, 981 A.2d 274, 281-82 (Pa. Super. 2009). Johnson has not raised a weight of the evidence claim in this direct appeal, and as such, it has not been preserved for appellate review. Pa.R.A.P. 302(a); see also Commonwealth v. Freeman, 573 Pa. 532, 827 A.2d 385, 402 (2003).\nII. Suppression Issues\nJohnson raises two issues in connection with the trial court\u2019s denial of his motions to suppress his statement to the police and evidence of him selling drugs with Talley. Our standard of review for such claims provides that we may consider only the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and so much of the defense\u2019s evidence as remains uncontradicted when read in the context of the record as a whole. Commonwealth v. Arter, 637 Pa. 541, 151 A.3d 149, 153 (2016). Where the record supports the suppression court\u2019s factual findings, we are bound by those facts and may reverse only if the legal conclusions drawn therefrom are in error. Id. As an appellate court, however, we are not bound by the suppression court\u2019s conclusions of law. Id.\nJohnson first argues that the trial court should have suppressed his statement to the police because the police did not inform him that they were going to question him about the deaths of Talley and R.R. until after he waived his Miranda rights. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 25. Johnson protests that he had no indication as to the purpose of the interrogation and was under the reasonable (but mistaken) assumption that he was stopped by the police and brought in for questioning because of outstanding arrest warrants issued for summary, non-traffic citations. Id. at 28.\nA waiver of Miranda rights is valid where the suspect is aware of the general nature of the transaction giving rise to the investigation. Commonwealth v. Dixon, 475 Pa. 17, 379 A.2d 553, 556 (1977). \u201c[O]nly when such knowledge is possessed by a suspect ... can [he] be said to understand the consequences of yielding the right to counsel.\u201d Id. This is because \u201c[i]t is a far different thing to forgo a lawyer where a traffic offense is involved than to waive counsel where first degree murder is at stake.\u201d Commonwealth v. Collins, 486 Pa. 114, 259 A.2d 160, 163 (1969). When a defendant challenges the validity of his Miranda waiver on this basis, the Commonwealth must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant was aware of the reason for the interrogation. Dixon, 379 A.2d at 556. The Commonwealth can meet this burden through evidence of the circumstances surrounding the interrogation, such as \u201cthe fact that the interrogation follows hard upon the criminal episode and there is no circumstance lending ambiguity to the direction and purpose of the questioning.\u201dId.\nIn the present case, the trial court found that substantial evidence supported Johnson\u2019s awareness that the police intended to question him about the fire and murders rather than warrants for non-traffic summary offenses. Trial Court Opinion, 3/23/2016, at 16-17. This evidence included: Johnson\u2019s knowledge of the fire and of Talley\u2019s and R.R.\u2019s deaths, his understanding that the police wanted to inspect Talley\u2019s vehicle as part of the investigation, and his possession of that vehicle. In light of these facts and the tight timeline between the murders and the police taking Johnson into custody, it was \u201ccompletely illogical\u201d for Johnson to think that a number of officers would \u201cswoop down on him, [and] tak[e] him into custody in a car that was owned by a homicide victim or potential homicide victim ... for some old summary citations, basically what amounts to a dispute between himself and the local [d]istict [c]ourt.\u201d N.T., 11/26/2014, at 19.\nThe trial court\u2019s factual findings are supported by evidence of record. Talley\u2019s cousin, Brittany Coles, testified that she knew Johnson through Talley. N.T., 11/25/2014, at 27. At about 4:30 p.m. on the day of the murders, Ms. Coles told Johnson that there was a fire in Talley\u2019s apartment and that she could not get in touch with Talley. Id. at 31. Talley\u2019s sister, Paulina Burke, testified that while she was at the hospital on the day of the fire, she received a phone call from Johnson. During this conversation, she told him that Talley and R.R. died. N.T., 9/16/2014, at 6; N.T., 6/30/2014, at 134. Ms. Burke knew that Johnson was driving Talley\u2019s car, and when she asked him to bring it to the police station for their investigation, Johnson refused, citing his outstanding warrants. N.T., 9/16/2014, at 6-7. At approximately 7:30 that evening, only a few hours after being told of the fire and Talley\u2019s and R.R.\u2019s deaths, uniformed police officers stopped Johnson while he was driving Talley\u2019s vehicle, the plates on which had been changed. N.T., 6/30/2014, at 123. When brought to the police station following this felony stop, Johnson was taken to an interview room to be interrogated by Detective Slattery and Detective Fuhrmann. Id. at 100-01. In consideration of these facts, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Johnson was aware that the police intended to question him with regard to what occurred in Apartment 604 of the Avalon Court Apartments.\nJohnson argues that his case is factually indistinguishable from Dixon. We disagree. In Dixon, a local magistrate convicted the defendant of malicious mischief and ordered her to pay restitution at the rate of fifty dollars a month, beginning in March 1973, until the $500 judgment was satisfied. Dixon, 379 A.2d at 555. The magistrate pointedly told the defendant that if she defaulted on her payments, a warrant would be issued for her arrest and police officers would be sent to arrest her. Id. The defendant failed to make even one payment, and as a result, a warrant for her arrest issued. Id.\nThat summer, the body of the defendant\u2019s young son was discovered in a wooded area and a police investigation ensued. Id. at 554. On August 14, 1973, three police officers appeared at the defendant\u2019s home and asked her to go with them to the police barracks. Id. The officers had in their possession the arrest warrant related to defendant\u2019s restitution delinquency, but because the defendant agreed to go with them, they did not show it or mention it to the defendant. Id. at 555. The officers did not tell the defendant why they wanted to speak with her. Id. at 554. At the barracks, the defendant was placed in an interrogation room and asked whether she knew why the officers wanted to speak with her. Id. at 556. The defendant responded affirmatively and executed a Miranda waiver.\nThe police immediately began to question the defendant about her son\u2019s death, to which she quickly confessed. Id. On appeal following her conviction for her son\u2019s murder, the defendant argued that her Miranda waiver was not knowing and voluntary because she believed that the police appeared at her house because of her failure to make restitution payments. Id. This Court agreed, concluding that the circumstances exhibited that a \u201cpalpable ambiguity\u201d existed as to the defendant\u2019s understanding of why she was being questioned. Id. at 557. Because the interrogating police officers took no measures to dispel the ambiguity before obtaining her waiver, the defendant\u2019s waiver could not be deemed to have been knowingly and intelligently made. Id.\nIt is Johnson\u2019s position that, just like the defendant in Dixon, he knew that there were outstanding arrest warrants for him on summary citations. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 28. He also points out that he was apprehended in a vehicle that was not his, thus creating another ambiguity as to the topic of the interrogation. Id. at 29. Johnson\u2019s arguments, however, entirely ignore all of the other above-reviewed information he possessed at the time of his arrest and interrogation. In Dixon, the ambiguity stemmed, in large part, from a magistrate\u2019s explicit warning that the defendant would be arrested if she did not comply with the terms of the restitution order (and her knowledge that she had not made any payments). Dixon, 379 A.2d at 557. Here, in significant contrast, Johnson\u2019s knowledge of relevant events at the time of his arrest and interrogation do not support a finding of any such ambiguity.\nFor his second.suppression issue, Johnson claims that no probable cause existed to support the issuance of a warrant for samples of his DNA. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 31. Generally, to be valid, a search warrant must be issued by a neutral and detached magistrate and supported by probable cause. U.S. Const. amend. IV; Pa. Const. art. 1 \u00a7 8; Commonwealth v. Lyons, 622 Pa. 91, 79 A.3d 1053, 1063-64 (2013). Probable cause exists where the totality of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit provide a fair probability that evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. Lyons, 79 A.3d at 1064. The issuing magistrate must apply this \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test in a practical, common-sense, and not overly-technical, manner. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 615 Pa. 354, 42 A.3d 1017, 1031 (2012). When a trial court reviews an issuing authority\u2019s decision to issue a search warrant, it must affirm unless there was no substantial basis for the issuing authority\u2019s decision. Lyons, 79 A.3d at 1064. In turn, on appeal, this Court will affirm the decision of the trial court unless we conclude that it committed an error of law or made a factual finding without record support. Id.\nHere, the application for a search warrant and accompanying affidavit of probable cause were filed by Detective Fuhrmann at 1:33 a.m. on November 26, 2013, within hours of the end of the interrogation of Johnson. The warrant application sought, inter alia, DNA samples by means of oral swabbing, swabbing of both hands, fingernail scrapings from both hands, and hair samples. Application for Search Warrant, 11/26/2013, at 1. In the affidavit of probable cause, Detective Fuhrmann detailed the fire in Apartment 604 and discovery of the bodies of Talley and R.R.; the determination that Talley had multiple stab wounds, including some that looked to be defensive wounds; and the conclusion that the fire appeared suspicious in nature. Affidavit of Probable Cause, 11/26/2013, at 1-2. He stated that based on his training and experience, he was aware that \u201carson is sometimes used to destroy or conceal evidence of a crime.\u201d Id. at 2. Detective Fuhrmann stated that Nigeria Gary, a resident of the apartment complex, observed Talley\u2019s vehicle speed out of the parking lot approximately ten minutes before the fire was detected. Id. at 3. Detective Fuhrmann also explained that earlier that evening, Paulina Burke informed the police that Johnson was at the Levittown Trace Apartments, and as a result, the police found Johnson there, in possession of Talley\u2019s vehicle, the license plates on which had been changed. Id. at 2. Detective Fuhrmann further explained that in his interview with Johnson earlier that evening, Johnson admitted to being with Talley and R.R. just prior to their deaths and to taking the Cadillac from Avalon Court, and that he \u201cgave conflicting accounts as to his possible involvement.\u201d Id. The detective also indicated that Johnson had a cut that appeared recent on the outside edge of one of his fingers. Id.\nThe magistrate issued the search warrant based on these sworn allegations. The trial court found the warrant sufficiently supported by probable cause, reasoning as follows:\nThe probable cause affidavit ... set forth the facts regarding the time and place of the fire, the death of [Talley] and R.R. and the stab wounds observed on the bodies. The affidavit also set forth facts regarding [Johnson\u2019s] connection with those events. [Johnson] admitted that he was in the apartment with the victims [on] the day of the fire. Within minutes of the fire being detected, [Johnson] fled the scene in a Cadillac at a high rate of speed, striking a parked car in the process. Within four hours of the fire, [Johnson] was stopped driving the Cadillac. At that time, the Cadillac displayed a license plate that did not belong to the vehicle. Just hours after the murders, police observed a cut on [Johnson\u2019s] hand. When he was questioned by the police as to his whereabouts at the time of the murders, [Johnson] gave conflicting accounts. [Johnson\u2019s] presence at the scene both before and after the fire started, his hasty flight from the scene in the apartment owner\u2019s car, his inconsistent statements to police and the injury to his hand provided sufficient circumstances, when viewed in a practical, common sense and realistic fashion, for the issuing authority to conclude that there was a fair probability that evidence of a crime would be found on [Johnson\u2019s] person. The motion to suppress ... for failure to set forth probable cause was, therefore, properly denied.\nTrial Court Opinion, 3/23/2016, at 20-21.\nBased upon our standard of review, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling. The trial court\u2019s findings are grounded in the affidavit\u2019s allegations and the trial court applied the proper legal standard, as it considered whether the allegations established a fair probability that evidence that could tie Johnson to these crimes could be found through his DNA.\nJohnson complains that while the allegations might establish that he was present at Talley\u2019s apartment and then fled, neither of these facts by themselves establishes probable cause for a warrant related to his involvement in the murders. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 34-35. To begin, Johnson\u2019s argument ignores many of the other substantive allegations set forth in the affidavit of probable cause, such as that he was found in possession of Talley\u2019s vehicle; the change of license plates; the cut on his hand and Talley\u2019s defensive wounds; and the inconsistent nature of his answers to police questions. Moreover, allegations amounting to probable cause need not be considered in isolation; rather, a probable cause determination is based on the totality of the circumstances. Lyons, 79 A.3d at 1064. Consideration of these facts, in addition to Johnson\u2019s admitted presence in Talley\u2019s home immediately before the fire was detected (and his frenzied flight from the apartment), all coalesce to establish a sufficient basis for the issuance of the search warrant.\nJohnson further claims that there was no basis for the issuance of a nighttime warrant. In addition to probable cause, an application for a warrant for a nighttime search must also show \u201csome reason why the search cannot wait until morning.\u201d Commonwealth v. Bowmaster, 101 A.3d 789, 794 (Pa. Super. 2014); see also Pa.R.Crim.P. 203(E) (\u201cNo search warrant shall authorize a nighttime search unless the affidavits show reasonable cause for such nighttime search.\u201d). This additional requirement is in recognition of the long-established doctrine that a nighttime intrusion imposes a greater burden on a person\u2019s privacy interests. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 203(E), Cmt. This enhanced burden on an individual\u2019s privacy, however, is not implicated when the subject is in police custody. See Commonwealth v. Cross, 508 Pa. 322, 496 A.2d 1144, 1149 (1985) (finding a challenge to issuance of nighttime warrant failed because appellant was in custody); Commonwealth v. Berkheimer, 57 A.3d 171, 179 n.10 (Pa. Super. 2012) (same). Furthermore, with regard to a nighttime warrant for the collection of biological evidence, this Court has held that where a defendant has been lawfully arrested and is in police custody, the seizure of hair samples and fingernail scrapings is \u201cso minor an imposition as to constitute only the slightest intrusion, if indeed such constituted an intrusion,\u201d especially in light of the fact that \u201cthe hair and fingernails could easily have been washed and brushed clean of any traces of relevant evidence.\u201d Cross, 496 A.2d at 1150.\nWe face a similar scenario here. In addition to Johnson being in police custody, the transient nature of the evidence sought to be collected supports the trial court\u2019s determination. The trial court fairly concluded that the requisite reasonable cause for a nighttime warrant existed because \u201c[ijnvestigators were searching for trace evidence on [Johnson\u2019s] person, evidence that is easily lost by the simple act of washing or the mere passage of time.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 3/23/2016, at 21. For these reasons, we find no trial court error on this issue.\nIII. Prior Bad Acts\nJohnson challenges the trial court\u2019s decision to introduce evidence relating to his drug dealing partnership trade with Talley pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence. This evidence included the empty, clear Ziploc baggies found on his person at the time of his arrest as well as the bags of heroin retrieved by Johnson\u2019s brother, Marquis, at Johnson\u2019s request from the Levittown Trace Apartments laundry room. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 44, 46. The bags retrieved from Levittown Trace Apartments were stamped \u201c# 1 way to go\u201d and were identical to bags found in Talley\u2019s car (used by Johnson when hastily leaving Talley\u2019s apartment), and scattered around Talley\u2019s head at the murder scene. Id. at 46. The trial court also permitted the introduction of statements made by Johnson to Marquis in which he admitted to selling drugs with Talley. Id. Finally, the trial court allowed the introduction of various electronic evidence of Johnson\u2019s drug sales conducted with Talley, including text messages between them and a videotaped drug buy executed by a confidential informant in Talley\u2019s apartment. Id. at 44, 46.\nThe trial court rejected Johnson\u2019s contention that this evidence of prior drug dealing activities was inadmissible under Rule 404(b)(1) of the Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence, which prohibits the use of evidence of \u201ca crime, wrong, or other act ... to prove a person\u2019s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.\u201d Pa.R.E. 404(b)(1). The trial court ruled that the evidence was admissible under one or more of the exceptions to Rule 404(b)(1) in order to prove \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge and identity.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 3/23/2015, at 25 (citing Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2)). On appeal, Johnson argues that no exceptions in Rule 404(b)(2) apply in these circumstances because there was no logical connection between the admitted evidence and the murders. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 52. Johnson argues that there was no actual proof as to when the heroin bags were hidden in the laundry room or that they were stolen from Talley\u2019s apartment. Id.\nIn its written opinion, the trial court presents a general statement of the decisional law relating to Rule 404(b), including citation to appellate decisions applying various of the Rule 404(b)(2) exceptions in specific factual scenarios. Trial Court Opinion, 3/23/2015, at 24-26. In ruling that the disputed evidence was admissible under one or more of these exceptions, however, the trial court did not conduct a principled analysis of any of the Rule 404(b)(2) exceptions. For example, while the trial court ruled that the evidence was admissible to prove \u201cidentity,\u201d it failed to acknowledge that the \u201cidentity\u201d exception under Rule 404(b)(2) requires proof that the bad acts and the crime on trial share \u201can almost uncanny similarity in all the details,\u201d Commonwealth v. Wable, 382 Pa. 80, 114 A.2d 334, 337 (1955), and be \u201cso nearly identical in method as to earmark them as the handiwork of the accused ... like a signature.\u201d Commonwealth v. Rush, 538 Pa. 104, 646 A.2d 557, 560-61 (1994) (quoting McCormick, Evidence, \u00a7 190 (1972 2d ed.); Commonwealth v. Bryant, 515 Pa. 473, 530 A.2d 83, 86 (1987). Of course, Johnson\u2019s prior drug selling activities with Talley were plainly not \u201csignature crimes\u201d at all vis-a-vis his alleged crimes on November 25, 2013 (e.g., arson and murder). These were not \u201csignature crimes.\u201d\nInstead of attempting to analyze whether the contested evidence fit into one of the Rule 404(b)(2) exceptions, the trial court, focused on whether it was admissible circumstantial evidence that Johnson committed the crimes with which he was charged. In connection with its \u201cidentity\u201d analysis, the trial court determined that \u201cheroin was inextricably intertwined with the murders of [Talley] and her children and the fires that were set inside their apartment.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 3/23/2015, at 25. Reviewing the challenged evidence, the trial court then concluded that it demonstrated that Johnson \u201cwas the individual who took the heroin, killed the victims and then lit two fires, making the death of the victims and the destruction of the evidence certain.\u201d Id. at 25-26. On appeal, the Commonwealth likewise insists that the evidence in question was admissible, but not because it was propensity evidence allowable under a Rule 404(b)(2) exception. Instead, the Commonwealth argues that the evidence was circumstantial proof that Johnson committed the crimes with which he was charged, as it was \u201cinextricably linked with the murder of Ms. Talley and the fire set inside her apartment.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 45.\nDespite the lack of a cogent argument to support the trial court\u2019s decision to permit the introduction of the evidence, we nonetheless conclude that there was no error in admitting the evidence pursuant to Rule 404(b), although we do so for reasons other than those relied upon by the trial court. To begin, Rule 404(b)(2) sets forth nine exceptions to Rule 404(b)(l)\u2019s prohibition against the use of propensity evidence. The official Comment to Rule 404 explains that this list of exceptions is non-exhaustive. Pa.R.E. 404, Comment. As such, courts are not restricted to the nine exceptions expressly listed in Rule 404(b)(2) when exercising their discretion to permit the admission of evidence of prior crimes, wrongs and acts, so long as the evidence is used for purposes other than to prove character or a propensity to act in accordance with traits of character.\nAlthough not specifically referencing Rule 404(b), this Court identified one such additional exception in our decision in Commonwealth v. Stanley, 498 Pa. 326, 446 A.2d 683 (1982). In Stanley, the appellant objected to the introduction of evidence to prove his prior first-degree murder conviction while on trial for a violation of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6106, which prohibits an individual convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d from possessing firearms. Id. at 588. The appellant argued that introduction of this evidence was prejudicial, particularly in light of his willingness to stipulate to the conviction. Id. The Commonwealth disagreed, arguing that section 6105 required proof of the commission of a separate prior crime, and that as a result it was entitled to introduce evidence of the separate prior crime in order to prove the crime presently at issue. Id. This Court agreed with the Commonwealth, ruling that \u201cappellant\u2019s murder conviction was undisputedly material and relevant to proving that he committed a \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d Id. As a result, it was \u201cproper\u201d evidence that the Commonwealth was entitled to use to prove its case. Id.\nAccordingly, our decision in Stanley confirms that where proof of an offense with which a defendant is charged requires proof of another crime or wrong, evidence of the other crime or wrong is necessarily admissible. In the present case, the Commonwealth charged Johnson with, inter alia, two counts of second-degree murder, alleging that the murders of Talley and R.R. were committed in the course of a robbery of Talley\u2019s heroin. See N.T., 6/2/2015, at 165-66. As a result, the Commonwealth was entitled to introduce evidence that was relevant to, and probative of, Johnson\u2019s alleged robbery of Talley\u2019s heroin\u2014even if the introduction of that evidence disclosed Johnson\u2019s prior bad acts to the jury.\nThe evidence challenged by Johnson was in fact all directly relevant and admissible to prove that Johnson stole heroin from Talley during the course of events leading to her murder and that of her daughter. Evidence of Johnson\u2019s collaborative drug selling activities with Talley (including his statements, the electronic evidence and the videotape) were all relevant and admissible to prove his knowledge of her heroin supply, including the quantities she possessed and where they were located in her apartment. The bags of heroin that Marquis recovered from Levittown Trace Apartments at Johnson\u2019s direction, in packaging identical to those found in Talley\u2019s apartment, were relevant and admissible to prove that Johnson had stolen these drugs from Talley,\nAccordingly, although we do so for reasons other than those relied upon by the trial court, we conclude that there was no error in connection with the admission of this evidence. The evidence was relevant and admissible to prove that Johnson committed a robbery in connection with the murders of Talley and R.R., and was therefore admissible to prove the second-degree murder charges.\nIV. Statement to Marquis\nJohnson next challenges the admission of certain testimony by his brother Marquis. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 55. Marquis testified that during a conversation with Johnson \u201cno more than five days\u201d before the murders, Johnson told him, \u201cI\u2019m willing to do anything to make a come up.\u201d N.T., 6/1/2015, at 63-64. Marquis further stated that his brother said that \u201canything\u201d included his willingness to \u201cshoot someone ... or be involved with anything[.]\u201d Id. at 64. Marquis indicated that he understood \u201cmake a come up,\u201d to refer to \u201ccoming up with income.\u201d Id. Over objections by Johnson that this testimony was not relevant and constituted impermissible \u201cprior bad acts\u201d evidence that did not fit within any of the exceptions provided in Rule 404(b)(2), the trial court disagreed, ruling that this testimony was admissible to \u201cestablish motive, identity, intent and premeditation.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 3/23/2016, at 27. Johnson raises the same objections here.\nRule 404(b) has no applicability in this context. On prior occasions, this Court has ruled that extrajudicial statements relating to a specific \u201ccrime, wrong or act\u201d may be admissible so long as they do not constitute impermissible hearsay. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. May, 584 Pa. 640, 887 A.2d 750, 762 (2005); Commonwealth. v. Simmons, 541 Pa. 211, 662 A.2d 621, 635 (1995). Here, however, Marquis\u2019 testimony regarding Johnson\u2019s alleged statements were not evidence of any particular \u201ccrime, wrong or act\u201d by Johnson. Rather, they constituted mere statements of his desire to make money (or, more generally, to attain success) and his willingness to do anything (even to kill) to accomplish this end.\nAs a result, Marquis\u2019 testimony was not inadmissible under Rule 404(b), as this rule was not implicated. Moreover, the trial court did not err in denying Johnson\u2019s relevance objection, as the testimony was clearly relevant evidence. Rule 401 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Evidence provides a broad definition of relevant evidence, as evidence is relevant if it \u201clogically tends to establish a material fact in the case, tends to make a fact at issue more or less probable, or supports a reasonable inference or presumption regarding the existence of a material fact.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hawk, 551 Pa. 71, 709 A.2d 373, 376 (1998) (quoting Commonwealth v. Spiewak, 533 Pa. 1, 617 A.2d 696, 699 (1992)). Even evidence that merely advances an inference of a material fact may be admissible. Id. Marquis\u2019 testimony describing Johnson\u2019s alleged statements is an example of such an inference, as one of the Commonwealth\u2019s theories at trial was that Johnson\u2019s expression of his intention to \u201cmake a come up\u201d provided him with a motive to kill Talley and steal her heroin supply. See N.T., 9/16/2014, at 91-92; N.T., 6/2/2015, at 108-09.\nImportantly, Johnson did not assert at trial or present here on appeal, any hearsay objections to Marquis\u2019 testimony about his (Johnson\u2019s) extrajudicial statements. Accordingly, whether this testimony constituted inadmissible hearsay or, conversely, satisfied one or more exceptions to the hearsay rule, is not before this Court.\nV. Unconstitutional Limitation of Mitigating Evidence\nSection 9711(e) enumerates eight mitigating circumstances for which a defendant may present evidence during the penalty phase of a capital prosecution. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e). Section 9711(e)(8), sometimes referred to as the \u201ccatchall\u201d mitigator, permits a capital defendant to present evidence \u201cconcerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8). Under section 9711(e)(8), Johnson sought to have his mitigation expert, Carol Krych, testify to \u201ca multi-genera-tional history of ... continuous abusive, neglectful behavior,\u201d as well as chronic poverty, drug abuse and mental illness suffered by Johnson\u2019s grandparents, parents, and aunts and uncles. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 62. Johnson sought to introduce such evidence in support of his \u201cconcept\u201d that due to the pervasiveness of abuse in his extended family\u2019s history, abusive and criminal behavior had become normalized and \u201che ... never had a chance to get out of this environment.]\u201d N.T., 6/6/2016, at 19.\nThe trial court limited the admission of this evidence. Drawing a boundary, the trial court reasoned that testimony regarding \u201cany event in a relative\u2019s life that was somehow made part of the family structure or that was made known to [Johnson], and therefore could be said to have had an impact upon him, would be relevant and admissible[,]\u201d but that \u201c[e]vidence from generations past regarding events at which [Johnson] was not present or of which he had never been made aware is not relevant or material to the personal history or character of [Johnson]\u201d and were therefore inadmissible. Trial Court Opinion, 3/23/2016, at 36-38. Heralding that the Eighth Amendment requires a jury to \u201cconsider and give full mitigating effect to any relevant mitigating evidence^]\u201d Johnson argues that the trial court\u2019s ruling was an unconstitutional infringement on his right to present mitigating evidence. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 63.\nIt is unconstitutional for a court to bar the presentation of relevant mitigation evidence during the penalty phase of a capital trial. Commonwealth v. King, 554 Pa. 331, 721 A.2d 763, 776 (1998) (discussing Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S, 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978)); Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 490, 110 S.Ct. 1257, 108 L.Ed.2d 415 (1990); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982)). This pronouncement only applies to mitigation evidence that is relevant. Commonwealth v. Hairston, 624 Pa. 143, 84 A.3d 657, 674 (2014) (providing that evidence of mitigating circumstances must satisfy the threshold requirements of being both relevant and admissible). As a general matter, evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence and the fact is of consequence in determining the action. Pa.R.E. 401.\nJohnson attempts to establish the relevance of the excluded evidence based upon a comment to the American Bar Association Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases 10.7 (\u201cGuideline 10.7\u201d). Johnson\u2019s Brief at 63-64. Guideline 10.7 provides that when developing mitigation evidence, defense counsel should seek records and information \u201cconcerning not only the client, but also his parents, grandparents, siblings, cousins and children\u201d because \u201c[a] multi-generational investigation extending as far as possible vertically and horizontally frequently discloses significant patterns of family dysfunction and may help establish or strengthen a diagnosis or underscore the hereditary nature of a particular impairment.\u201d Id. at 64 (quoting Guideline 10.7, Cmt.). Based on this comment, Johnson declares that his evidence of three generations\u2019 worth of \u201ctrauma inducing bio-psycho-social risk factors\u201d and agency intervention in the family should have been deemed relevant and admissible. Id. at 65.\nJohnson argues that this Court has recognized this concept in two prior cases, Commonwealth v. Spotz, 587 Pa. 1, 896 A.2d 1191 (2006), and Commonwealth v. Williams, 581 Pa. 57, 863 A.2d 505 (2004). Johnson\u2019s Brief at 65. A review of these cases, however, indicates that this Court has never endorsed Guideline 10.7 as a basis for the admission of evidence in death penalty eases. In Spots, we acknowledged only that Guideline 10.7 recognizes that defense counsel\u2019s duty to pursue mitigation evidence extends to investigating prior convictions that could be used as aggravating circumstances. Spotz, 896 A.2d at 1226. In Williams, Chief Justice Saylor cited to Guideline 10.7 (among other guidelines) for the same proposition in a dissent. Williams, 863 A.2d at 528 (Saylor, J., dissenting). Notably, Chief Justice Saylor acknowledged that this Court \u201chas not endorsed or adopted [the ABA Guidelines] on a wholesale basis.\u201d Id. at 527 n.6.\nBeyond drawing our attention to Spotz and Williams, Johnson does not articulate a principled argument for the adoption of the comment to Guideline 10.7 as a reason for the admission of evidence. On its face, the comment is merely a prescriptive for capital defense counsel\u2019s obligation to thoroughly investigate mitigation evidence. It is, for lack of a better term, advice to defense counsel recommending potentially fertile sources of mitigation evidence. It does not, as Johnson now contends, provide any substantive basis to establish a per se rule requiring the admissibility of every type of evidence referenced in the comment. The comment does not address the issue Johnson raises here, specifically whether all evidence of a family history of abusive and neglectful behavior, poverty, drug abuse and mental illness\u2014suffered by Johnson\u2019s grandparents, parents, and aunts and uncles, and of which Johnson had no knowledge or familiarity\u2014is admissible even if he cannot establish that it had any material effect on his character, his record, or the circumstances of his offense. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8).\nWe cannot say that, in a future case, we might well find that the type of \u201cfamily history\u201d evidence that Johnson sought to offer into evidence is admissible. Here, however, we hold that Johnson has failed to provide any persuasive argument or advocacy for this Court to adopt his position.\nVI. Penalty Phase Jury Instruction and Verdict Slip\nJohnson asked the trial court to address each discrete mitigating circumstance that he offered under section (e)(8) separately when instructing the jury and to list them separately on the verdict slip. The trial court denied this request, but provided the following charge to the jury:\nThe defense has alleged and presented evidence to support various mitigating circumstances. They are also defined by statute, and I will go through those now. First, that the defendant has no significant history of prior criminal convictions. Second, that the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the killing. Third, the age of the defendant at the time of the crime. Specifically, the defense has offered by way of mitigating that the defendant was [twenty-one] years old at the time the crimes were committed.\nAnd fourth, this has been referred to as the catch-all, but it is actually more specific than that. The fourth area of mitigation circumstances ... alleged by the defense is any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.\nNow, under that mitigating eireumstance[,] the defense has made a number of arguments regarding the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of the offense. They have argued that he has impaired neurological functioning. They have argued lack of stability. They have argued maternal neglect or general neglect. They have argued maternal rejection. They have argued physical abuse. They have argued that the defendant lost his father. They have argued that his family was involved in the criminal justice system in [sic] various criminal conduct. They have argued institutional failure. They have argued the effect of multiple adverse childhood experiences on the defendant. They have argued that he suffers from mental illness and was not medicated at the time of the crime. They have argued that the defendant desires to do well in his life and that there are other circumstances you may consider.\nAll of those arguments, all of those arguments relate to the mitigating circumstance number four. That is one mitigating circumstance. But you may consider all of those facts in support of that mitigating circumstance.\nI want to be clear. One, what I have just listed for you is not an exhaustive list of what the defendant argued under that mitigating circumstance. It will be for you to recall everything that Mr. Fioravanti has presented and argued to you that would support that mitigating circumstance. I also want to be very clear that neither I nor Mr. Fioravanti\u2014my instructions or Mr. Fioravanti\u2019s arguments should limit you in terms of what you can find as a mitigating circumstance or mitigating evidence under that catch-all mitigating circumstance. Any other mitigating factor relating to the character and record of the defendant and circumstances of his offense may be\u2014should be considered by you. There is no limit to the mitigation that you may find under this factor so long as it arises from the evidence,\nN.T., 6/8/2015, at 201-04.\nJohnson argues that the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions requires a jury to consider all mitigating factors, and that grouping all non-statutorily defined mitigating evidence under one category creates the risk that the jury will not give the evidence of each non-statutory mitigating factor separate and equal consideration. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 58-60. Johnson contends that the failure to address each factor individually in the jury instruction and to include each mitigating circumstance separately on the verdict slip could have led the jury to \u201cdiscount\u201d their importance during deliberations. Id. at 58-61.\nThis Court recently rejected the argument that Johnson now advances. The defendant in Commonwealth v. Mattison, 623 Pa. 174, 82 A.3d 386 (2013), asked the trial court to charge the jury separately on each of the seven claims of mitigating evidence that he presented under section 9711(e)(8) and for the verdict slip to reflect them separately. The trial court declined to do so, instead instructing the jury that it could find as a mitigating factor \u201cany evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the [defendant and the circumstances of [defendant\u2019s offense.\u201d Id. at 398. On appeal, the defendant argued that the trial court\u2019s refusal to give his requested instruction caused the jury to give less consideration to the evidence he presented of non-statutory mitigation factors. Id. at 399. Rejecting the argument, this Court explained that there is no authority or sound legal basis for requiring a trial court to enumerate, either in jury instructions or on verdict slips, every discrete category of catch all mitigation evidence presented. Id. at 400.\nThe defendant in Mattison candidly admitted that no Pennsylvania statute or case law supported his argument, and he instead directed us to federal cases prohibiting state courts from restricting a capital defendant\u2019s presentation of relevant mitigating evidence. Id. at 399 (citing Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U.S. 393, 107 S.Ct. 1821, 95 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987); Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 1669, 90 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986); Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 102 S.Ct. 869, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982); Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978)). This Court reasoned, however, that the defendant\u2019s claim confused the distinction between allowing a jury to consider mitigating evidence and guiding its consideration of the mitigating evidence. Id. at 400. The federal cases at issue involved instances in which the trial court either restricted the type of mitigation evidence presented or advised the jury to ignore non-statutory mitigation evidence. Id. at 399-400. We concluded that where a trial court allows the contested, non-statutory mitigation evidence to go to the jury and guides its consideration by instructing the jury in conformance with the language of section 9711(e)(8), there is no error in the trial court\u2019s instruction. Id. at 400 (discussing Commonwealth v. King, 554 Pa. 331, 721 A.2d 763, 777 (1998)).\nOur decision in Mattison disposes of Johnson\u2019s claim. When a defendant presents mitigation evidence under section 9711(e)(8), the trial court must instruct the jurors only-in conformance with the language of section 9711(e)(8). A trial court is not required to instruct the jury as to each theory of mitigation raised under the broad banner of section 9711(e)(8), and the verdict slip is not required to reflect each such theory separately.\nVII. Denial of Motion to Bar Death Penalty Due to Nature of Crimes\nJohnson argues that the Commonwealth should not have been permitted to pursue the death penalty because the \u201cnature and brutality\u201d of the crimes would overwhelm the jury and negate its ability to impartially consider the mitigation evidence he put forth, thereby violating his constitutional right to have the jury \u201cconsider and give effect to all mitigating evidence.\u201d Johnson\u2019s Brief at 72-73. Johnson asserts that the death penalty is intended for only the worst offenders and the very worst crimes, and argues that the jury here was predisposed to place him in that unenviable category because of the nature of the crimes. Id. at 69-73.\nThe trial court found this argument meritless, reasoning that \u201cthe ultimate question with regard to this claim is whether the jurors would be able to put aside any bias, sympathy, prejudice or emotion\u201d and decide the case based upon the evidence and the jury instructions. Concluding that voir dire revealed that a \u201cfair and impartial\u201d jury was seated, that it repeatedly instructed the jury \u201cto make a dispassionate evaluation of the evidence!!,]\u201d and that the jury found that mitigating factors outweighed aggravating factors with regard to Talley\u2019s murder (but not R.R.\u2019s murder), the trial court determined that the jury properly considered the mitigating evidence. Trial Court Opinion, 3/23/2016, at 35-36.\nWe agree that there is no merit to this claim. Johnson\u2019s argument is that the Commonwealth should not have been permitted to pursue the death penalty because the particularly brutal nature of his crimes would blind the jury to its duty to consider and weigh mitigation evidence. Taken to its logical conclusion, Johnson\u2019s position would result in the anomalous situation in which the more heinous the crime, the less likely that its perpetrator would be eligible for the death penalty because of the overmastering influence the circumstances could have on the jury\u2019s impartiality. Criminals who commit the most egregious crimes would be effectively exempt from the death penalty, when the death penalty has been reserved for precisely such crimes. See Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407, 420, 128 S.Ct. 2641, 171 L.Ed.2d 525 (2008) (\u201c[Capital punishment must be limited to those offenders who commit a narrow category of the most serious crimes and whose extreme culpability makes them the most deserving of execution.\u201d). This would be a bizarre and irrational outcome, and we do not endorse it.\nVIII. Constitutionality of Aggravating Factors\nIn his final argument, Johnson alleges that three statutory aggravating factors the jury found in relation to the murder of R.R., sections 9711(d)(6), (11), and (16), are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 78. To survive such a challenge, an aggravating circumstance must be found to \u201cgenuinely narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to others found guilty of murder.\u201d Commonwealth v. Baumhammers, 625 Pa. 354, 92 A.3d 708, 738 (2014). Johnson does not explain how the provisions he has challenged fail to meet this standard. Instead, without discussing the three factors individually, he offers a blanket statement that these aggravating circumstances fail to adequately define what constitutes a circumstance that would fall under each of them, and therefore \u201cfail to provide any meaningful basis for distinguishing those few cases in which the death penalty is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.\u201d Johnson\u2019s Brief at 80. We disagree.\nSection 9711(d)(16) establishes as an aggravating factor the fact that the victim was a child under twelve years of age. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(16). This Court rejected a vagueness challenge to section 9711(16) in Commonwealth v. Bardo, 551 Pa. 140, 709 A.2d 871 (1998), concluding that the provision \u201cis abundantly clear and merely reflects the legislative judgment that killing a person under the age of twelve is a particularly heinous crime\u201d and that \u201c[i]f anything,\u201d it is a \u201cmodel of clarity.\u201d Id. at 878-79. Johnson offers no persuasive basis on which to depart from our prior decision in Bardo,\nWe have similarly rejected two prior vagueness challenges to section 9711(d)(ll), which provides as an aggravating factor the fact that where \u201c[t]he defendant has been convicted of another murder committed in any jurisdiction and committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(11). In Commonwealth v. Fletcher, 580 Pa. 403, 861 A.2d 898 (2004), we concluded that\nthis aggravating circumstance clearly narrows the class of persons eligible for the death penalty by excluding those individuals who have not been convicted of another murder. Moreover, the \u201cmultiple murder\u201d aggravator reasonably justifies the imposition of a more severe sentence because, based upon their risk of danger to general society, those individuals convicted of multiple murders warrant a harsher punishment. As such, the \u201cmultiple murder\u201d aggravator comports with the necessary requirements of the Eighth Amendment and the Due Process Clause.\nCommonwealth v. Fletcher, 580 Pa. 403, 861 A.2d 898, 913 (2004). Relying on Fletcher, we reached the same result in Baumhammers. Baumhammers, 92 A.3d at 737-38. As with section 9711(d)(16), Johnson has failed to provide any principled reason for this Court to deviate from its prior decisions in Fletcher and Baumhammers.\nSection 9711(d)(5) provides an aggravating circumstance where \u201c[t]he victim was a prosecution witness to a murder or other felony committed by the defendant and was killed for the purpose of preventing his testimony against the defendant in any grand jury or criminal proceeding involving such offenses.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(5). As with sections 9711(d)(11) and 9711(d)(16), this provision includes a precisely tailored description of the criteria that must be met for the invocation of this aggravator. Moreover, the legislative intent for including this aggravator should be clear, namely that committing a subsequent crime (a murder) to avoid punishment for a prior crime merits a harsher sentence. Johnson provides no refutation to these conclusions, and we will not construct an argument on his behalf. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 604 Pa. 176, 985 A.2d 915, 924 (2009) (\u201cIt is not the obligation of this Court, even in a capital case, to formulate [the] [a]ppellant\u2019s arguments for him.\u201d).\nIX. Review of the Death Sentence Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)\nThis Court is required to review every death sentence to ensure that it was not imposed as a result of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor and that there is evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstances. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(1), (3); Commonwealth v. Harris, 572 Pa. 489, 817 A.2d 1033, 1058 (2002). The death penalty was imposed for the murder of R.R. The jury found as aggravating circumstances the fact that she was under the age of twelve, that she was a witness to her mother\u2019s murder and was killed to prevent her from identifying Johnson as her mother\u2019s killer, and that Johnson was convicted of committing another murder. Murder of the First Degree of [R.R.] Sentencing Verdict Slip, 8/16/2015, at 3. There is ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding of these aggravating factors, much of which has been detailed hereinabove.\nThe sound factual predicate for the aggravating factors bolsters a conclusion that the sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor. Indeed, the jury also found three mitigating circumstances, but in its ultimate calculus decided that they were outweighed by the aggravating factors. The record reveals nothing but a measured and sober deliberation. Accordingly, we must affirm the sentence of death. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3).\nConclusion\nHaving found no reversible error, we affirm Johnson\u2019s convictions and judgment of sentence. The Prothonotary is hereby directed to transmit to the Governor the complete records of the trial, sentencing hearing, imposition of sentence and review by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(i).\nChief Justice Saylor and Justices Baer, Todd, Dougherty and Wecht join the opinion, and Justice Mundy joins the majority except for Part III where she concurs in the result.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(1).\n. The apartment belonged to a woman named Gisele Ucci. At the time of these events, Ms. Ucci was temporarily residing in Argentina. She allowed Talley to stay in her apartment and use her vehicle, a maroon Cadillac, while she was away. For ease of reference, we refer to the apartment as Talley\u2019s residence and the maroon Cadillac as Talley's vehicle.\n, Talley was also found to have been hit in the face with such force that one of her front teeth was knocked out.\n. Both Ms. Coles and Ms. Burke testified that they knew Johnson's phone number but on the day in question, he called from a phone number that they did not recognize.\n. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\n. Specifically, the police found in his pocket a bundle of small, clear, plastic Ziploc baggies commonly used to package controlled substances, N.T., 6/1/2015, at 87.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2502(a),(c), 2603(a), 3301, 907.\n. 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(8), (11), (13), (17).\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(5), (11), (16).\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(1), (2), (4).\n. Johnson also received consecutive sentences of twenty to forty years of imprisonment for third-degree murder and ten to twenty years of imprisonment for arson, and a concurrent sentence of two and a half to five years for the possessing instruments of crime conviction.\n. The record developed at trial established that the officers performed a felony stop when taking Johnson into custody, N.T., 6/1/2015, at 25, and that the felony stop procedure is more confrontational than a traffic stop. Id. No such evidence was presented during the suppression phase of these proceedings, and so we may not consider it in our review of this suppression issue. See, e.g., In re L.J., 622 Pa. 126, 79 A.3d 1073, 1085 (2013) (holding that this Court\u2019s scope of review for suppression rulings is limited to the record developed at the suppression hearing).\n. Beyond this biological evidence, the warrant also sought to collect Johnson\u2019s clothing and to photograph his body. Application for Search Warrant, 11/26/2013, at 1. Johnson does not challenge the seizure of his clothes or photographs of his body.\n. We review these claims mindful that the admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court, and we will not disturb its rulings absent an abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Weiss, 565 Pa. 504, 776 A.2d 958, 967 (2001).\n. \u2018\u2018We may affirm a trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling if we deem it to have been correct on grounds other than those specified by the court itself, particularly where the additional reason is apparent from the record.\u201d Commonwealth v. Edwards, 588 Pa. 151, 903 A.2d 1139, 1157 n.19 (2006).\n. \"Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admitted for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2).\n. See also 1 Imwinkelried, Uncharged Misconduct Evidence \u00a7 2:11 (2005) (explaining that evidence of an uncharged act is admissible where \"the proponent can characterize the act as part of a discrete event chargedf;]\u201d for instance, where \"[t]he charge is robbery, but the predicate proving the force is the rape. ... the prosecutor is entitled to prove the rape as an essential part of the charged event.\u201d).\n. The jury acquitted Johnson of these charges.\n. Ms. Krych described herself as \"a capital mediation specialist, as well as a licensed alcohol and drug counselor\u201d and \"also a private investigator.\u201d N.T., 6/5/2015, at 5.\n. Johnson identifies the following areas of Ms. Krych\u2019s testimony as wrongfully excluded: allegations of abuse; neglect or drug abuse spanning three generations of Johnson\u2019s family (as substantiated by court or agency records); the lack of \"consistent supportive resources\u201d throughout the large family due to \u201cpoverty, extreme dysfunction and arrests;\u201d multi-generational reports of mental health issues, sibling and parental animosity, corporal punishment; and involvement with the criminal justice system, Johnson's Brief at 66.\n. The admission of mitigation evidence is within the discretion of the trial court. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hairston, 624 Pa. 143, 84 A.3d 657, 674 (2014).\n. It is noteworthy that the trial court permitted testimony regarding Johnson\u2019s mother's turbulent life not only prior to his birth, but also prior to her relationship with Johnson\u2019s father, as well as substantial testimony regarding the violent, dysfunctional and deeply unstable relationship that existed between Johnson's parents before he was born. See N.T., 6/5/2015, at 27-45.\n. Johnson identifies the following discrete mitigating circumstances: his history of mental illness for which he was not medicated at the time of the crimes; the physical/psychological trauma he has endured since childhood; impaired neurological functioning; lifelong neglect, verbal and physical abuse (including torture); the death of his father, the only person to whom Johnson felt attached, at age seven; his immediately family's severe dysfunction, including extensive involvement with the criminal justice system; institutional failure; the effect of chronic stress and multiple adverse childhood experiences, which created a high risk of developing maladaptive behaviors; and evidence that he \"wanted to do well.\u201d Johnson's Brief at 56-57.\n. Johnson acknowledges Mattison but does not discuss it except to concede that this Court rejected the argument he presently advances therein. Johnson's Brief at 56 n.6.\n. The trial court's instruction as reproduced above did identify many of the specific claims of mitigation that Johnson raised under section 9711(e)(8). This jury instruction therefore went well beyond the instruction the trial court was required to give, and was far more detailed than the instruction in Mattison.\n. In his discussion of this issue, Johnson also argues for a \"categorical ban\u201d on the death penalty based upon various United States Supreme Court decisions that hold certain categories of offenders may not be subjected to the death penalty. Johnson\u2019s Brief at 72-73, 78 (discussing Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407, 128 S.Ct. 2641, 171 L.Ed.2d 525 (2008); Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002)). Johnson did not raise this issue before the trial court or in his statement of matters complained of on appeal; as such, it is waived. Hairston, 84 A.3d at 672 (finding issue waived in capital case where defendant failed to include it in his statement of matters complained of on appeal); Freeman, 827 A.2d at 402.\n. The jury did find multiple mitigating factors as to both murders. See Talley Sentencing Verdict Slip, 6/18/2015, at 3-4; R.R. Sentencing Verdict Slip, 6/18/2015, at 3. This is strong evidence that the jury was, in fact, able to consider and weigh the mitigating evidence.\n. We note that Chief Justice Saylor, in a dissenting posture, has expressed his \"continuing reservations\" with this Court's interpretation of section 9711(d)(5) as applying to potential prosecution witnesses, indicating that, based on his reading of the provision, \u201ca relevant prosecution [must] have preceded the killing.\u201d Commonwealth v. Daniels, 628 Pa. 193, 104 A.3d 267, 321 & 322 n.3 (2014) (Saylor, J. dissenting). Johnson has not raised that issue in this appeal. Notably, moreover, for purposes of our statutory review, the jury found other aggravating circumstances; as such, consideration of this particular question is presently unnecessary. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3)(ii) (\u201cThe Supreme Court shall affirm the sentence of death unless it determines that ... the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d).\u201d).\n. These were Johnson's age, his lack of prior convictions, and \u201ccatch all [sic] [ ] mitigation concerning [his] character.
