{"id": "481064", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nThe only issue in this appeal is whether the appellant, Girard Rubber Corporation, a foreign corporation, is \u201cdoing business\u201d in Pennsylvania and is therefore subject to service of process under Section 1011 of the Business Corporation Law, Act of May 5, 1988, P.L. 864, art. X, \u00a7 1011, as amended, 15 P.S. \u00a7 2011. (Repealed and replaced by Act of November 15, 1972, P.L. 1063, No. 271, \u00a7 5, 42 Pa. S. \u00a7 8309.) Appellant is the defendant in an assumpsit action brought by the appellee, McCrory Corporation. Appellee seeks indemnification from the appellant and alleges that the appellant negligently manufactured a rubber suction cup tip placed on a toy arrow which injured a minor plaintiff who recovered a judgment against the appellee which had sold the arrow.\nService on the appellant, a New York Corporation, was made through the Secretary of the Commonwealth pursuant to Section 1011(B) of the Business Corporation Law, Act of May 5, 1933, P.L. 364, art. X, \u00a7 1011(B), as amended, 15 P.S. \u00a7 2011(B). Appellant filed preliminary objections challenging the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction over the New York Corporation. The trial court dismissed the preliminary objections and the Superior Court unanimously affirmed that decision on appeal. McCrory Corp. v. Girard Rubber Corp., 225 Pa.Super. 45, 307 A.2d 435 (1973). We then granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nAppellant concedes that five percent of its gross sales, approximately $41,000 per year, are transacted with Pennsylvania customers, and that these orders are shipped into Pennsylvania by truck. The appellant, however, argues that it is not \u201cdoing business\u201d in Pennsylvania because it maintains no office or place of business in Pennsylvania, nor does it have any employees or representatives located in this state. The appellant also argues that the present assumpsit action arises out of a series of transactions, all of which took place outside of Pennsylvania and which were in no way connected with Pennsylvania. The appellant\u2019s arguments must be rejected since the appellant concedes that it ships merchandise directly into Pennsylvania.\nThe shipping of merchandise into Pennsylvania by the appellant is an act which constitutes \u201cdoing business\u201d in Pennsylvania, under section 1011(C), of the Business Corporation Law. That section provides:\n\u201cFor the purposes of determining jurisdictions of courts within this Commonwealth, the doing by any corporation in this Commonwealth of a series of similar acts for the purpose of thereby realizing pecuniary benefit or otherwise accomplishing an object, or doing a single act in this Commonwealth for such purpose, with the intention of thereby initiating a series of such acts, shall constitute \u2018doing business.\u2019 For the purposes of this subsection the shipping of merchandise directly or indirectly into or through this Commonwealth shall be considered the doing of such an act in this Commonwealth.\u201d\nAct of May 5, 1933, P.L. 364, art. X, \u00a7 1011(C), as amended, 15 P.S. \u00a7 2011(C). (Emphasis added.)\nIn Image Ten, Inc. v. The Walter Reade Organization, Inc., 456 Pa. 485, 322 A.2d 109 (1974), we held that a foreign corporation which shipped motion picture film into Pennsylvania was \u201cdoing business\u201d even though it had no offices, agents, or employees physically present in this state. We stated that under section 1011 (C):\n\u201cA nonregistered foreign corporation may now be subject to suit in Pennsylvania whether or not its agents or employees were ever physically present in this State and regardless of the contractual relationship between the foreign company and its Pennsylvania representative. Under the last sentence of amended section 1011(C), \u2018the shipping of merchandise directly or indirectly into or through this Commonwealth\u2019 is sufficient conduct to establish that a foreign corporation is \u2018doing business\u2019 in Pennsylvania, and that conduct would therefore subject the foreign corporation to Pennsylvania\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d\nId. at, 322 A.2d at 114.\nSince it is undisputed that the appellant ships merchandise into Pennsylvania the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d necessary to meet the requirements of due process are present. Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 253, 2 L.Ed. 2d 1283, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 1240, 1298, (1968); McGee v. Life Insurance Co., 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957), International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945), Image Ten v. The Walter Reade Organization, Inc., 456 Pa., 485 322 A.2d 109 (1974).\nWe note that in 1972, when section 1011(C) was reenacted in substantially the identical language which was in effect when this action was filed, the legislature added the following provision of the law:\n\u201c[T]he jurisdiction and venue of courts of the Commonwealth shall extend to all foreign corporations and the powers exercised by them to the fullest extent allowed under the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\nAct of November 15, 1972, P.L. 1063, No. 271, \u00a7 8309, 42 Pa. S. 8309(b).\nSince the appellant was \u201cdoing business\u201d in Pennsylvania, the trial court properly dismissed the preliminary objections.\nOrder affirmed.\nEAGEN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case."}
