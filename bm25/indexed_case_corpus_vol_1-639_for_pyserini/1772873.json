{"id": "1772873", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellee, attorney Richard D. Ballou, is a private practitioner who has among his clients four second class townships, a borough, a county coroner and an industrial development authority. On April 29, 1980, appellee filed a petition in the Commonwealth Court for declaratory and injunctive relief from the application of the financial disclosure requirements of the Ethics Act, 65 P.S. \u00a7 401 et seq. (Supp. 1981-82), which appellant, the State Ethics Commission, had by regulation declared to apply to borough and township solicitors. Appellant, in turn, filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. The Commonwealth Court overruled appellant\u2019s preliminary objections and, by order of February 4, 1981, granted relief to appellee. The court reasoned that, as a \u201cmunicipal solicitor,\u201d appellee is a \u201cpublic employee\u201d subject to the financial disclosure requirements of the Ethics Act, but that the financial disclosure provisions of the act as applied are \u201cunconstitutional as an infringement on the Supreme Court\u2019s exclusive power to govern the conduct of persons privileged to practice law in Pennsylvania.\u201d Ballou v. State Ethics Comm\u2019n, 56 Pa.Cmwlth. 240, 245, 424 A.2d 983, 986 (1981).\nIt is well settled that when a case raises both constitutional and non-constitutional issues, a court should not reach the constitutional issue if the case can properly be decided on non-constitutional grounds. We conclude that, in his capacity as solicitor, appellee is neither a \u201cpublic employee\u201d nor a \u201cpublic official\u201d within the scope of the Ethics Act and, hence, is not statutorily compelled to comply with the act\u2019s financial disclosure requirements. Unlike the Commonwealth Court, we base our determination upon statutory, not constitutional, grounds. Accordingly, we affirm only that portion of the order of the Commonwealth Court which declares that the Ethics Act does not apply to appellee.\nI\nThe Ethics Act requires the filing of a statement of financial interests for the preceding calendar year by public employees, public officials and candidates for public office. 65 P.S. \u00a7 404. The information to be disclosed in the statement is set forth in 65 P.S. \u00a7 405. Since appellee is not a candidate for public office, the financial disclosure requirements of the Ethics Act apply to him only if, in his capacity as solicitor, he is either a \u201cpublic employee\u201d or a \u201cpublic official\u201d within the scope of the act.\nThe Ethics Act defines \u201cpublic employee\u201d as:\n\u201c \u2018Public employee.\u2019 Any individual employed by the Commonwealth or a political subdivision who is responsible for taking or recommending official action of a non-ministerial nature with regard to:\n(1) contracting or procurement;\n(2) administering or monitoring grants or subsidies;\n(3) planning or zoning;\n(4) inspecting, licensing, regulating or auditing any person;\nor\n(5) any other activity where the official action has an economic impact of greater than a de minimus [sic] nature on the interests of any person.\n65 P.S. \u00a7 402. \u201cPublic official\u201d is defined as:\n\u201c \u2018Public official.\u2019 Any elected or appointed official in the Executive, Legislative or Judicial Branch of the State or any political subdivision thereof, provided that it shall not include members of advisory boards that have no authority to expend public funds other than reimbursement for personal expense, or to otherwise exercise the power of the State or any political subdivision thereof. \u2018Public official\u2019 shall not include any appointed official who receives no compensation other than reimbursement for actual expenses.\u201d\nId. Additionally, the Ethics Act provides a separate definition for \u201cState consultant\u201d:\n\u201c \u2018State consultant.\u2019 A person who, as an independent contractor, performs professional, scientific, technical or advisory service for a State agency, and who receives a fee, honorarium or similar compensation for such services . . . . \u201d\nId. However, no reference to \u201cState consultant\u201d is contained in those provisions of the act relating to financial disclosure.\nThe duties of appellee as township solicitor are set forth in the Second Class Township Code:\n\u201cDuties of solicitor\nThe township solicitor, when directed or requested so to do, shall prepare or approve such bonds, obligations, contracts, leases, conveyances, ordinances and assurances to which the township may be a party; he shall commence and prosecute all actions brought by the township for or on account of any of the estates, rights, trusts, privileges, claims, or demands, as well as defend all actions or suits against the township, or any officer thereof, wherein or whereby any of the estates, rights, privileges, trusts, ordinances, or accounts, of the township, may be brought in question before any court in the Commonwealth, and shall do every professional act incident to the office which he may be authorized or required to do by the board of supervisors or by any resolution. He shall, whenever required, furnish the board of supervisors, or any of them, with his opinion in writing upon any question of law which may be submitted by any of them in their official capacities.\u201d\nAct of May 1, 1933, P.L. 103, \u00a7 582, as amended, 53 P.S. \u00a7 65582 (1957). The Borough Code sets forth similar duties of a borough solicitor:\n\u201cDuties of solicitor\nThe borough solicitor, when directed or requested so to do by council or the mayor, shall prepare or approve such bonds, obligations, contracts, leases, conveyances, ordinances and assurances to which the borough or any department thereof may be a party; he shall commence and prosecute all actions brought by the borough for or on account of any of the estates, rights, trusts, privileges, claims, or demands, as well as defend all actions or suits against the borough, or any officer thereof, wherein or whereby any of the estates, rights, privileges, trusts, ordinances, or accounts, of the borough, or any department thereof, may be brought in question before any court in the Commonwealth; and shall do every professional act incident to the office which he may be authorized or required to do by the council or the mayor. He shall, whenever required, furnish the council, or committees . thereof, the mayor, or the head of department, with his opinion in writing upon any question of law which may be submitted by any of them in their official capacities.\u201d\nAct of February 1, 1966, P.L. (1965), 1656, \u00a7 1117, 53 P.S. \u00a7 46117 (1966). The County Code provides a brief description of the duties of a coroner\u2019s solicitor:\n\u201cSolicitor to coroner\n[The coroner\u2019s ] solicitor shall advise the coroner upon all legal matters that may be submitted to him and shall conduct any litigation in connection with the coroner\u2019s office when requested so to do by the coroner.\u201d\nAct of August 9, 1955, P.L. 323, \u00a7 1252, added by Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1421, \u00a7 1, 16 P.S. \u00a7 1252 (Supp. 1981 \u2014 82). Although appellee\u2019s duties as solicitor to an industrial development authority are not specifically prescribed by statute, the record does not reveal that these duties vary in any significant respect from the legal advisory duties that appellee performs as township, borough, and coroner\u2019s solicitor. The Commonwealth Court treated all these positions similarly, referring to appellee as a \u201cmunicipal solicitor.\u201d\nII\nThe Commonwealth Court concluded that, as a municipal solicitor, appellee is a \u201cpublic employee\u201d because he is employed by the Commonwealth and has important duties to perform, including the recommendation of \u201cofficial action of a non-ministerial nature,\u201d such as whether \u201cto accept or reject a proposal for settling a lawsuit.\u201d 56 Pa.Cmwlth. at 244-45,424 A.2d at 985-86. The Commonwealth Court did not reach the issue whether appellee is a \u201cpublic official.\u201d\nCase law and the statutory language governing the duties of township and borough solicitors make clear that a solicitor functions as a legal advisor to the appointing body. The Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion that, as solicitor, appellee is a \u201cpublic employee\u201d within the meaning of the Ethics Act, is premised on the erroneous theory that compensation from public funds is synonymous with employment by the Commonwealth. Contrary to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s supposition, it is commonplace for a person to perform services and to be compensated for those services, and yet not be \u201cemployed,\u201d as that term is commonly understood. The Ethics Act recognizes this distinction by providing for a classification of \u201cstate consultant\u201d separate and apart from the categories of \u201cpublic employee\u201d and \u201cpublic official.\u201d Indeed, a municipal solicitor, functioning as a legal advisor to the appointing body, closely resembles a consultant who, as defined in the Ethics Act, \u201cperforms professional, scientific, technical or advisory services .. . [and] receives a fee, honorarium or similar compensation for such services.\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 402.\nUnlike a public employee, a solicitor has no enforceable right to continue in his position for the tenure of his appointment. Our cases have held that, as a consequence of the solicitor\u2019s confidential relationship with the appointing body which he serves, the solicitor is removable at the will of the appointing power. Even if appointed for a fixed term and salary, the solicitor has no contractual right to recover any resulting loss in compensation. See Snyderwine v. Craley, 434 Pa. 349, 254 A.2d 16 (1969); Naef v. Allentown, 424 Pa. 597, 227 A.2d 888 (1967).\nFurther, unlike a public official, the solicitor is responsible only to the appointing body, and may act only pursuant to that body\u2019s authorization. He owes no independent duties to the public, and exercises none of the powers of sovereignty. In speaking of a county solicitor, this Court has stated:\n\u201cNo functions of government are delegated to him. Nor can he lawfully exercise any powers of sovereignty. He serves as counsel to the commissioners in the discharge of their public duty just as any privately employed attorney serves his clients. His duties are to advise the commissioners and to represent the county in litigation authorized by them or instituted against the county.\n* * * * sfc *\n\u2018His duties are important in the sense that the advice and actions of an attorney always entail grave responsibility; but they are performed for the board. He has no direct connection with, or responsibility to, the public; he is entirely subordinate to the board; they may follow his advice or disregard it; he cannot control their actions; he cannot perform their duties; his appointment is for no definite term, and he can be recalled at any time; he has no grave and important duties involving a function of government in their performance\nCommonwealth ex rel. Foreman v. Hampson, 393 Pa. 467, 473 & 474-75, 143 A.2d 369, 372 & 372-73 (1958), quoting Alworth v. County of Lackawanna, 85 Pa.Super. 349, 352 (1925). See also Wiest v. Northumberland County, 115 Pa.Super. 577, 176 A. 74 (1935).\nIII.\nWhere, as here, an attorney is retained as legal advis- or to a municipal client which is itself directly accountable to the public and must authorize his actions, the exclusion of the attorney from the scope of the Ethics Act is compatible with the act\u2019s purpose. That purpose, as expressed by the Legislature, is to assure \u201cpublic confidence in government\u201d by preventing either actual or apparent realization of \u201cpersonal financial gain through public office.\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 401. Municipal solicitors are situated similarly to \u201cmembers of advisory boards,\u201d who are excluded from the reach of the act when the advisory board has \u201cno authority to expend public funds other than reimbursement for personal expense, or to otherwise exercise the power of the State or political subdivision thereof.\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 402.\nAbsent a clear expression of legislative intent to treat municipal solicitors differently from others who serve government in an advisory capacity with neither powers of sovereignty nor attributes of a public employee, we conclude that the financial disclosure provisions of the Ethics Act do not apply to appellee, who serves his municipal clients \u201cjust as any privately employed attorney serves his clients.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Foreman v. Hampson, supra. Accordingly, we affirm, on statutory grounds, that portion of the order of the Commonwealth Court which directs judgment in favor of appellee.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed insofar as it directs judgment in favor of appellee.\nO\u2019BRIEN, C. J., and WILKINSON, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nKAUFFMAN, J., files a dissenting opinion in which NIX, J., joins.\n. Act of October 4, 1978, P.L. 883, \u00a7 1 et seq.\n. As we have previously stated, \u201c[tjhis Court has consistently held that we should not decide a constitutional question unless absolutely required to do so.\u201d Mt. Lebanon v. County Board of Elections, 470 Pa. 317, 322, 368 A.2d 648, 650 (1977). Accord, e.g., Lattanzio v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 461 Pa. 392, 336 A.2d 595 (1975).\n. Our decision is limited to the application of the Ethics Act to attorneys serving in appellee\u2019s capacities. Not presented on this record is the application of the act to any others serving in the public sector as attorneys. See, e. g., Knup v. City of Philadelphia, 386 Pa. 350, 353, 126 A.2d 399, 400 (1956) (\u201ca court . . . does not undertake to decide academically the unconstitutionality or other alleged invalidity of legislation until it is brought into operation so as to impinge upon the rights of some person or persons\u201d).\n. The dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Kauffman takes the inconsistent and unsupportable position that a municipal solicitor is subject to the provisions of the Ethics Act but that \u201can outside attorney or law firm specially retained for the tried of particular litigation\u201d by a municipality is exempt. Manifestly, it is peculiar to conclude, as does the dissent, that the act applies to one group of lawyers performing legal services for a municipality, and yet does not apply to another performing similar legal services. Surely, the issue of the act\u2019s coverage should be consistently resolved.\nContrary to the assertion of the dissenting opinion, the method of compensation has no bearing on the applicability of the Ethics Act. Indeed, a retainer for \u201can outside attorney or law firm\u201d may often result in greater compensation than a salary for a municipal solicitor. In any event, the Ethics Act applies both to compensated and uncompensated public officials, thereby demonstrating that the method of compensation is irrelevant."}
