{"id": "907007", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe are all of opinion that the sixth section of the Act of May 16,1891, P. L. 75, was correctly construed by the learned judge of the court below, and hence there was no error in striking off the appeal because it was not taken and filed within the time prescribed by said act. To have held otherwise would have been an attempted judicial amendment of the act in question.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
