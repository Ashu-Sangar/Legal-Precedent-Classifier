{"id": "1763781", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nSection 5501(1) of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code defines an \u201cincompetent\u201d as\n\u201ca person who, because of infirmities of old age, mental illness, mental deficiency or retardation, drug addiction or inebriety:\n(1) is unable to manage his property, or is liable to dissipate it or become the victim of designing persons\n20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5501(1). The sole question presented on this appeal is whether the evidence supports a decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, adjudging appellant Lillian Caine presently \u201cincompetent\u201d within the meaning of section 5501(1). In our view, the evidence does support the decree. Hence we affirm.\nAppellant was born in May of 1909. In 1966 she became a resident of Wernersville State Hospital, a Commonwealth facility for the mentally disabled. No guardian was appointed at that time. Accordingly, pursuant to statute, the facility\u2019s Department of Revenue agent took custody of appellant\u2019s property. See Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966, Act of October 20,1966, P.L. 96, \u00a7 424, 50 P.S. \u00a7 4424 (1969).\nIn June of 1978, the Commonwealth petitioned the orphans\u2019 court for a decree adjudging appellant presently incompetent and appointing a guardian. See 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5511. The petition contains an affidavit and competency report of Otto Ramik, M. D., a psychiatric physician employed at Wernersville. The affidavit and competency report state that, based on his personal examination of appellant, Dr. Ramik was of the opinion that appellant is \u201cdisinterested, . . . isolates [herjself, lacks insight and judgment.\u201d Dr. Ramik\u2019s reports also expressed the view that appellant is a \u201cdependent individual that requires assistance and supervision,\u201d and is schizophrenic. Dr. Ramik\u2019s reports thus concluded appellant \u201cis incompetent to manage her own affairs.\u201d Proper notice was given and the court issued a rule on appellant to show cause why she should not be adjudged incompetent and a guardian should not be appointed. The court fixed a return date of July 10, 1978.\nCounsel entered an appearance for appellant. On July 10, the court held a hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s petition. Dr. Ramik testified, both on direct and on cross-examination, as to his opinion contained in the Commonwealth\u2019s petition. Despite Dr. Ramik\u2019s sworn statement that because of appellant\u2019s condition her welfare would not be promoted by her presence in court and her presence might endanger others in the courtroom, appellant appeared and also testified.\nThe orphans\u2019 court agreed with Dr. Ramik\u2019s assessment, concluding that appellant \u201cis so mentally infirmed that she is likely to dissipate or lose her estate and become the victim of designing persons. . . . \u201d Accordingly, by its decree the court appointed as guardian George Geist, \u201cGuardian Officer\u201d of Wernersville. This appeal followed.\nAt the outset the Commonwealth presents a procedural contention which purportedly requires an affirmance of the orphans\u2019 court decree without a consideration of the merits. According to the Commonwealth, appellant has improperly failed to file exceptions to the court\u2019s decree and thus no issues are preserved for appellate review. See Volkhardt Estate, 484 Pa. 52, 398 A.2d 656 (1979); Stanley Estate, 470 Pa. 483, 368 A.2d 1259 (1976). The present record, however, does not sustain the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that appellant has failed to file exceptions. Included in the record is a copy of a signed order of the orphans\u2019 court, certified by the clerk of the orphans\u2019 court to be true and correct, which provides:\n\u201cAND NOW, TO WIT, this 26th day of March, 1980, for the reasons set forth in our most recent opinion, respondent\u2019s exceptions filed nunc pro tunc are hereby denied.\u201d\nFrom this it is clear that \u201cexceptions nunc pro tunc\u201d were filed. So, too, it is clear that the orphans\u2019 court chose to consider the exceptions. See Sup.Ct.O.C. Rule 2.1. Thus we reject the Commonwealth\u2019s procedural contention and turn to the merits.\n\u201c[A] man may do what he pleases with his personal estate during his life. He may beggar himself and his family if he chooses to commit such an act of folly.\u201d Bryden Estate, 211 Pa. 633, 636, 61 A. 250, 251 (1905). Accordingly, before a guardianship can be imposed it must be established not only that a person is, under 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5501, \u201cunable to manage his property, or is liable to dissipate it or become the victim of designing persons.\u201d It must also be established that this \u201cinability to manage one\u2019s property results from \u2018infirmities of old age, mental illness, mental deficiency or retardation, drug addiction or inebriety.\u2019 \u201d Porter Estate, 463 Pa. 411, 415, 345 A.2d 171, 173 (1975). Moreover, for the Commonwealth to prevail on its present petition, it must establish appellant\u2019s incompetency by more than a mere preponderance of the evidence. Rather, it is agreed that the Commonwealth\u2019s proof must be clear and convincing.\nWhat is in dispute here is whether the Commonwealth has met this standard. According to appellant, the Commonwealth has failed clearly and convincingly to prove either that appellant suffers from \u201cthe infirmities of old age, mental illness, mental deficiency or retardation, drug addiction or inebriety\u201d or that any of these disabilities causes appellant to be \u201cunable to manage [her] property, or liable to dissipate it or become the victim of designing persons.\u201d 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5501(1). In appellant\u2019s view, her own testimony, and not the testimony of Dr. Ramik, is the \u201cbest evidence\u201d of her abilities and establishes her competency.\nAppellant\u2019s contention, based on her own assessment of testimony and not that of the orphans\u2019 court, must be rejected. Here, as in Myers Estate, 395 Pa. 459, 150 A.2d 525 (1959),\n\u201cthe court below had the benefit of not only hearing and observing all witnesses but, most important, had the opportunity to hear and observe the alleged incompetent. We do not substitute our judgment for that of the court below; even though we, had we been sitting in judgment below, might have reached a contrary result . . . .\u201d\n395 Pa. at 462, 150 A.2d at 526. Based on its opportunity both to hear and to observe Dr. Ramik and appellant, the court chose to give credence to Dr. Ramik\u2019s evaluation of appellant\u2019s present condition. That evaluation, setting forth his first-hand knowledge of appellant\u2019s condition and her inability to manage her own affairs, amply permitted the factfinder to conclude that appellant presently is incompetent. \u201cConflicting evidence was presented but the resolution of these conflicts was for the trier of fact. Kay v. Kay, 460 Pa. 680, 334 A.2d 585 (1975).\u201d Garges Estate, 474 Pa. 237, 243, 378 A.2d 307, 310 (1977). As Reed v. Universal C.I.T. Credit Corp., 434 Pa. 212, 217, 253 A.2d 101, 104 (1969) stated, \u201c[t]his Court does not sit as a trier of issues of fact, expecting to be persuaded that one or the other side is more credible. That is a task for a trial court and we would never invade that area of the judicial process.\u201d\nThe record is clear that here, as in Colt\u2019s Case, 215 Pa. 333, 64 A. 597 (1906), \u201c[this] proceeding was instituted by disinterested parties manifestly from proper motive and solely to preserve the appellant\u2019s estate for [her] own good.\u201d 215 Pa. at 335, 64 A. at 598. Our review satisfies us that the orphans\u2019 court committed neither error of law nor an abuse of discretion. The orphans\u2019 court\u2019s decree therefore cannot be disturbed.\nDecree affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nLARSEN, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which KAUFFMAN, J., joins.\n. See The Administrative Code, Act of June 7, 1923, P.L. 498, \u00a7 202, as amended, 71 P.S. \u00a7 12 (1962); The Administrative Code of 1929, Act of April 9, 1929, P.L. 177, \u00a7\u00a7 202 & 401, as amended, 71 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 62 & 111 (Supp.1979); Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act of 1966, Act of October 20, 1966, P.L. 96, \u00a7\u00a7 201 & 202, 50 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 4201 & 4202 (1969).\n. The Commonwealth\u2019s petition was filed pursuant to the settlement of the Vecchione v. Wohlgemuth case. See Vecchione v. Wohlgemuth, 377 F.Supp. 1361 (E.D.Pa.1974); id., 426 F.Supp. 1297 (E.D. Pa.), aff'd, 558 F.2d 150 (3d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. Beal v. Vecchione, 434 U.S. 943, 98 S.Ct. 439, 54 L.Ed.2d 304 (1977); Vecchione v. Wohlgemuth, 80 F.R.D. 32 (E.D.Pa.1978).\n. Rule 2.1 provides:\n\u201cThe rules adopted by the Supreme Court regulating the practice and procedure of the Orphans\u2019 Courts of this Commonwealth, and the rules adopted by such courts, shall be liberally construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action or proceeding to which they are applicable. The court at every stage of any action or proceeding may disregard any error or defect of procedure which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties in interest.\u201d\n. The parties\u2019 agreement on the applicable standard of proof in applications for an adjudication of incompetency is well-founded. As long ago as Bryden Estate, supra, this Court, in adopting the opinion of the orphans\u2019 court in that case, stated that \u201c[ajpplications of this nature are not to be encouraged, and should not be granted except in a clear case.\u201d Accord, Colt's Case, 215 Pa. 333, 64 A. 597 (1906). As recently as Porter Estate, 463 Pa. 411, 345 A.2d 171 (1975), this Court noted that the \u201cfair preponderance\u201d standard applicable where a person seeks an adjudication of competency is \u201ca much lighter burden than that upon those who seek to obtain an initial adjudication of incompetency.\u201d 463 Pa. at 416 n.6, 345 A.2d at 174 n.6. See Myers Estate, 395 Pa. 459, 462 & 463, 150 A.2d 525, 526 & 527 (1959) (\u201cbefore any person shall be deprived of the right to handle his or her own property and manage his or her own affairs there must be clear and convincing proof of mental incompetency and such proof must be preponderating\u201cfinding of mental incompetency is not to be sustained if there is any evidence of such incompetency but only where the evidence is preponderating and points unerringly to mental incompetency\u201d). Cf. Elliott v. Clawson, 416 Pa. 34, 35, 204 A.2d 272, 273 (1964) (\u201c[i]t has long been the law of Pennsylvania that the evidence required to set aside a transaction on the basis of mental incompetency must be \u2018clear, precise and convincing\u2019. . . [citing Myers]\").\n. It must be emphasized that neither our holding nor the holding of the orphans\u2019 court in any respect permanently forecloses appellant from personally managing her own property. Appellant is free to seek a subsequent adjudication of competency, 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5517, which is to be granted if she establishes her competency by a \u201cfair preponderance\u201d of the evidence.
