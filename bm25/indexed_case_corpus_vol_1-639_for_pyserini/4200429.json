{"id": "4200429", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 4th day of March, 2011, the \u201cPetition to Stay Proceedings During Appellant\u2019s Incompetency and Request to File Amended 1925(b) Statement\u201d is DENIED. Both the Petition and the Commonwealth\u2019s Response assume that some level of competency in the appellant is required before a direct capital appeal may proceed; the parties then dispute whether appellant\u2019s proffer establishes incompetency. Upon consideration of the parties\u2019 pleadings and the submission of the trial judge, suggesting a remand, we hereby REMAND this matter to the trial court for a hearing and determination, as expeditiously as possible, on appellant\u2019s claim that he is incompetent to proceed with this direct appeal.\nIn addition to determining competency, we direct the parties to address, and the trial court to determine in the first instance, the following predicate and related questions which are necessary to a proper decision here:\n(1) What is the appropriate standard for assessing the competency of a capital defendant to proceed with a direct appeal?\n(2) Must a capital defendant be deemed competent under that standard before the direct appeal may proceed to decision, or may the appeal proceed upon the issues of record identified and briefed by counsel, and this Court\u2019s statutory review? In this consideration, the parties and the trial court are directed to address (a) the availability and relevance of the appointment of a next friend or guardian for purposes of prosecuting the appeal, see Commonwealth v. Haag, 570 Pa. 289, 809 A.2d 271 (Pa.2002); and (b) the efficacy, propriety and relevance of administering medication to appellant, in order to determine appellant\u2019s interest in pursuing his appeal, and to facilitate his participation. See Commonwealth v. Watson, 597 Pa. 483, 952 A.2d 541 (Pa.2008); Commonwealth v. Sam, 597 Pa. 523, 952 A.2d 565 (Pa.2008).\nThe trial court is further directed to issue an opinion which addresses the above questions, as well as the questions set forth in appellant\u2019s Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) statement. The parties will then follow the briefing schedule duly established by this Court\u2019s Prothonotary and will fully brief all relevant merits issues, as well as issues respecting the competency determination, if any. The appeal will not be bifurcated for a separate and preliminary consideration of the competency issue, including the effect of any finding of incompetency upon the power of this Court to proceed with a merits disposition, prior to briefing on the merits. The record is to be made complete, and the briefing is to be made complete, prior to argument and submission of the case for decision before this Court.\nMatter remanded with directives; jurisdiction is relinquished.\nJustice TODD files a Dissenting Statement joined by Justice BAER."}
