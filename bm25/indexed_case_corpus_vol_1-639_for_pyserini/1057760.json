{"id": "1057760", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe appellee is the assignee of a lease containing a warrant for the confession of judgment against the lessee for breach of its covenants. The assignment of it was accepted by the appellee \u201caccording to its full tenor and effect.\u201d In view of these words appellants claim the right to enter judgment against the appellee; but this overlooks the fact that it signed no warrant for the confession of judgment. The warrant to confess judgment given by the original lessee is not the warrant of the appellee, his successor, and the judgment entered against it was properly stricken off as not being self-sustaining: Stewart v. Jackson et al., 181 Pa. 549.\nAppeal dismissed at the costs of the appellants."}
