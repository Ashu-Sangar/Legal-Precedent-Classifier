But the services were rendered to the executor after the death of the testator. The fees due the plaintiff were then part of the expenses of administration of the estate in the orphans\u2019 court, and that court has exclusive jurisdiction. The executor who resigned might just as well bring suit against this one for his commissions.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant."}
