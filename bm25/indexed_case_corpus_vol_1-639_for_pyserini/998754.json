{"id": "998754", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWhile the contract of January 30, 1911, is joint in form, it is, as the court below correctly held, several in effect, supporting the action brought by W. A. James, the appellee. With appellants\u2019 first assignment of error out of the way, it remains only to say that, in the court\u2019s submission of the case to the jury, no error is discoverable, and the judgment is, therefore, affirmed."}
