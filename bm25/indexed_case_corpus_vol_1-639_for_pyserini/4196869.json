{"id": "4196869", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice GREENSPAN.\nAppellant Percy Thompson challenges the Superior Court\u2019s order affirming his judgment of sentence for possession of a controlled substance. We affirm.\nOn January 21, 2005, in the evening, Philadelphia Police Officer Orlando Ortiz was on duty in the 2400 block of Leithgow Street. Officer Ortiz knew the neighborhood as a high crime area in which narcotics, and specifically heroin, regularly were sold. The area was designated by the Philadelphia Police Department as an \u201cOperation Safe Streets\u201d neighborhood. Officer Ortiz, a nine-year veteran of the police force, and his partner, Officer Correa, were in plainclothes and driving an unmarked vehicle. Officer Ortiz saw a car parked by the sidewalk and observed Appellant standing in the street by the driver\u2019s side door. Officer Ortiz watched Appellant hand the male driver some money and saw the driver give Appellant a small object in return. Based on what he saw on the street and what he knew, including the fact that he had made several hundred narcotics arrests of this very type, Officer Ortiz believed the men were engaged in a drug transaction. Officer Ortiz stopped Appellant and recovered from his pocket a packet of heroin. Officer Correa approached the driver and ultimately recovered two packets of heroin from his hand and an additional 14 packets from his person.\nAppellant was charged with possession of a controlled substance. He filed a pre-trial motion to suppress the heroin, claiming that police lacked the probable cause necessary to support the search and seizure. Philadelphia Municipal Court Judge James M. DeLeon denied the motion, found Appellant guilty after a stipulated trial, and imposed a 12-month probationary sentence. Appellant filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. Judge Susan I. Schulman denied the writ. Appellant filed an appeal with the Superior Court raising the same single claim regarding probable cause. The Superior Court panel affirmed based on its then-recent opinion in Commonwealth v. Dunlap, 846 A.2d 674 (Pa.Super.2004) (en banc).\nThis Court granted Appellant\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal on the following issues:\n1. Whether the initial seizure and immediately ensuing search lacked probable cause and whether the lower courts applied erroneous standards to judge the constitutionality of police conduct.\n2. Whether per curiam decisions of this Court specifically citing Commonwealth v. Banks, [540 Pa. 453] 658 A.2d 752 (Pa.1995), are precedential and controlling authority.\nWith respect to the first issue, we are reviewing the trial court\u2019s ruling denying Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. \u201cOur standard of review in addressing a challenge to a trial court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion is whether the factual findings are supported by the record and whether the legal conclusions drawn from those facts are correct.... [W]e must consider only the evidence of the prosecution and so much of the evidence of the defense as remains uncontradicted when read in the context of the record as a whole.\u201d Commonwealth v. Eichinger, 591 Pa. 1, 915 A.2d 1122, 1134 (2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 894, 128 S.Ct. 211, 169 L.Ed.2d 158 (2007). Those properly supported facts are binding upon us and we \u201cmay reverse only if the legal conclusions drawn therefrom are in error.\u201d Id.\nThe parties agree that police were required to have probable cause in order to stop, seize, and search Appellant in the manner they did. Thus, we apply the well-established legal standard that governs this matter. Probable cause is made out when \u201cthe facts and circumstances which are within the knowledge of the officer at the time of the arrest, and of which he has reasonably trustworthy information, are sufficient to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the suspect has committed or is committing a crime.\u201d Commonwealth v. Rodriguez, 526 Pa. 268, 585 A.2d 988, 990 (1991). The question we ask is not whether the officer\u2019s belief was \u201ccorrect or more likely true than false.\u201d Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 742, 103 S.Ct. 1535, 75 L.Ed.2d 502 (1983). Rather, we require only a \u201cprobability, and not a prima facie showing, of criminal activity.\u201d Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 235, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983) (citation omitted) (emphasis supplied). In determining whether probable cause exists, we apply a totality of the circumstances test. Commonwealth v. Clark, 558 Pa. 157, 735 A.2d 1248, 1252 (1999) (relying on Gates, supra).\nThis Court frequently has addressed the particular issues related to law enforcement\u2019s observations of drug trafficking on the street. Appellant insists that the long-standing \u201cobserved transaction\u201d jurisprudence in this Commonwealth mandates reversal here. Among other cases, Appellant relies specifically on this Court\u2019s holdings in Commonwealth v. Dunlap, 596 Pa. 147, 941 A.2d 671 (2007), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 448, 172 L.Ed.2d 321 (2008), Banks, supra, and Commonwealth v. Lawson, 454 Pa. 23, 309 A.2d 391 (1973). According to Appellant, the Superior Court\u2019s ruling in this case \u201cdefies that long line of controlling precedent\u201d which holds that \u201ca single commercial transaction on a public street, without more, does not give rise to probable cause.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 7.\nThe Commonwealth, on the other hand, asserts that this Court\u2019s jurisprudence supports the Superior Court\u2019s decision here. According to the Commonwealth, the facts present more than the mere observation of a simple commercial transaction. Further, argues the Commonwealth, this case presents \u201can opportunity to clarify that when an officer who is familiar with drug sales sees what he recognizes as a drug sale, at a specific drug-selling location, he has probable cause to arrest the parties to the transaction.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 5.\nWe consider, in their order of decision, the cases on which Appellant relies. In Lawson, police observed the appellant as he stood on the street and received currency from individuals to whom he handed small objects that he retrieved from his wife. After observing three such transactions, police arrested the couple, who ultimately faced conspiracy and narcotics sales charges. In response to a claim that police lacked probable cause to arrest, the Lawson Court noted that \u201call of the detailed facts and circumstances must be considered.\u201d The Lawson Court concluded that those circumstances amply supported probable cause. 309 A.2d at 394.\nThe time is important; the street location is important; the use of a street for commercial transactions is important; the number of such transactions is important; the place where the small items were kept by one of the sellers is important;\nthe movements and manners of the parties are important. Considering the facts and circumstances in their totality, we conclude that the officers acted as prudent men in believing that some type of contraband was being sold.\nId.\nIn Banks, decided over twenty years after Laiuson, this Court considered whether a police officer\u2019s \u201cchanced\u201d observation of a \u201csingle, isolated exchange of some currency for some unidentified item or items, taking place on a public street at midday,\u201d was sufficient to establish probable cause where the suspect also fled from police. 658 A.2d at 753. The Banks Court held that such circumstances fell \u201cnarrowly short\u201d of probable cause. Id. While the Banks opinion gave few details on the specific circumstances of that case, the majority noted that \u201cwell recognized additional factors giving rise to probable cause were not present.\u201d Id. These included \u201ca case where a trained narcotics officer observed either drugs or containers commonly known to hold drugs ... a case where the police observed multiple, complex, suspicious transactions ... [or] a case in which the police officer was responding to a citizen\u2019s complaint or to an informant\u2019s tip.\u201d Id.\nDunlap is this Court\u2019s most recent case on the issue of on-the-street drug trade. In Dunlap, Philadelphia Police Officer Devlin, a five-year veteran of the police force and a nine-month member of the drug strike force, observed the suspect on a Philadelphia street. Officer Devlin, who had previously conducted about fifteen to twenty narcotics arrests in the area, testified that the neighborhood suffered from \u201ca high rate of nefarious activity, including drug crimes.\u201d Id. at 675. As Officer Devlin watched, the suspect engaged in a brief conversation with another man to whom he handed money and from whom he received small objects in return. Based on his experience and beliefs, Officer Devlin concluded that he had witnessed a drug transaction and so he arrested the suspect. Cocaine in the suspect\u2019s possession led to drug charges and, ultimately, a pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence based on lack of probable cause.\nThe trial court in Dunlap held that the evidence was sufficient to establish probable cause and the Superior Court agreed. The en banc panel relied on the fact that Officer Devlin was an experienced narcotics officer, as well as the fact that the neighborhood had a reputation as a high drug-crime area. Id. at 674 (citation omitted). This Court granted an appeal in order to determine whether the decision comported with Banks.\nThe majority opinion in Dunlap focused its analysis on the controlling nature of Banks and the \u201crelevance of police training and experience to the probable cause determination.\u201d 941 A.2d at 674. The Dunlap majority held that \u201cpolice training, without more, is not a fact to be added to the quantum of evidence to determine if probable cause exists, but rather a \u2018lens\u2019 through which courts view the quantum of evidence observed at the scene.\u201d Id. at 675. The Dunlap majority characterized as erroneous the Superior Court\u2019s use of training and experience as a \u201cstand-alone factor\u201d and stated: \u201c[t]o be clear, we hold that ... a police officer\u2019s training and experience is not a probable cause factor as in the Lawson sense.\u201d Id. at 676-77. Applying its holding, the Dunlap majority concluded that probable cause was lacking. Id. at 679.\nAt first glance, these statements of the Dunlap majority appear to exclude completely police training and experience as factors relevant to the probable cause calculation. But the Dunlap majority went on to explain its holding in a manner that arguably contradicted these statements, or at the very least obscured the standard the majority sought to establish.\nWe do not seek to minimize the experience gained through years serving on the police force. Quite to the contrary, we recognize that many officers, particularly those with specialized training, are able to recognize trends and methods in the commission of various crimes. For instance, an officer who has specialized in drug crimes may be more suspicious that a package contains illegal narcotics because of the form of packaging used to conceal those drugs. He or she may recognize criminal activity where a non-police citizen may not. However, a court cannot simply conclude that probable cause existed based upon nothing more than the number of years an officer has spent on the force. Rather, the officer must demonstrate a nexus between his experience and the search, arrest, or seizure of evidence. By doing so, a court aware of, informed by, and viewing the evidence as the officer in question, aided in assessing his observations by his experience, may properly conclude that probable cause existed. This is true even where the court may have been unable to perceive the existence of probable cause had the court viewed the same evidence through the eyes of a reasonable citizen untrained in law enforcement.\nId. at 675-76 (citation omitted) (emphasis supplied). Thus, in explaining its holding, the Dunlap majority rejected blind reliance on a certain number of years on the police force as a probable cause factor, but nonetheless confirmed that police experience and training is relevant when the testifying officer is able to demonstrate a nexus between his or her experience and the conduct observed.\nIn a thoughtful concurring opinion, Justice Saylor joined the Dunlap majority with respect to its holding that Banks must be upheld. Id. at 680 (Saylor, J., concurring). But Justice Saylor\u2019s very first statement on the issue was that he believed a police officer\u2019s experience \u201cmay be fairly regarded as a relevant factor in determining probable cause.\u201d Id. at 679 (Saylor, J. concurring). Despite this clear departure from the majority\u2019s purported holding, Justice Saylor characterized the majority opinion as a \u201clegitimate and reasoned effort\u2019.\u2019 to resolve the competing issues of individual privacy interests and law enforcement/community protection. Id. at 680 (Saylor, J., concurring). Significantly, two of the four justices who constituted the Dunlap majority also joined Justice Saylor\u2019s expression, including his explicit statement that police experience constituted a relevant factor.\nRegarding the issue of probable cause factors, Justice Saylor warned that an officer\u2019s \u201ccursory assertion\u201d of training and experience would be insufficient to trigger consideration because the goal at the suppression hearing was to \u201cexplain and justify the arrest ... [which is] not accomplished by a general claim of expertise.\u201d Id. (citing Wayne R. LaFave, 2 Search and Seizure \u00a7 3.2(c) at 44-45 (4th ed.2004)). Noting that the arresting officer in Dunlap did little more than recite his experience, Justice Saylor concluded that the testimony failed to establish how that experience informed the officer\u2019s view of the exchange he observed. Id. at 681.\nAppellant\u2019s interpretation of Dunlap is that the majority opinion makes clear the \u201climited function of police experience\u201d in the probable cause calculation. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 11. Further, Appellant argues, Dunlap precludes the suppression court from accepting as a \u201cstand alone factor\u201d a police officer\u2019s \u201chunch\u201d that a suspect is engaged in illegal conduct. Id. at 12. Appellant argues that under the Dunlap majority\u2019s holding, reversal is mandatory because the trial court relied on Officer\u2019s Ortiz\u2019s training to find probable cause.\nThe Commonwealth counters that the trial court\u2019s decision in this case does not offend Dunlap because the officer\u2019s training was not the only basis upon which probable cause was found and because the officer established a nexus between his experience and his observation.\nIn attempting to discern the precise holding and proper significance of the Dunlap majority opinion, we observe that the expression purports to hold that police experience is not a factor relevant to probable cause, while at the same time directs that police experience is relevant to the probable cause inquiry. The Dunlap majority rejected the notion that police experience is worthy of the label \u201cfactor,\u201d but it conceded that such experience informs the court\u2019s decision so much that it enables the court to find probable cause where it otherwise would be unable to do so. It is difficult to reconcile Dunlap\u2019s professed holding with its own explanation and rationale. Further, and perhaps more importantly, two of the justices in the Dunlap majority (as well as the three other justices who wrote their own expressions) were of the opinion that police experience and training indeed are proper factors to consider in determining probable cause.\nIn light of the Dunlap majority\u2019s equivocal explanation of its holding, and given the manner in which the votes were cast in that case, it is not surprising that both parties claim Dunlap supports their positions on appeal. Our careful consideration of this issue, as well as the uncertainty of our jurisprudence in this area of the law, leads us to conclude that a clarification is warranted.\nUpon review of the various Dunlap expressions, we recognize the logic and soundness of Justice Saylor\u2019s concurring opinion and so hold that \u201ca police officer\u2019s experience may fairly be regarded as a relevant factor in determining probable cause.\u201d 941 A.2d at 679 (Saylor, J., concurring). We caution, however, that an officer\u2019s testimony in this regard shall not simply reference \u201ctraining and experience abstract from an explanation of their specific application to the circumstances at hand.\u201d Id. at 681 (Saylor, J., concurring). As the Dunlap majority itself observed, \u201ca court cannot simply conclude that probable cause existed based upon nothing more than the number of years an officer has spent on the force. Rather, the officer must demonstrate a nexus between his experience and the search, arrest, or seizure of evidence.\u201d Dunlap, 941 A.2d at 676. Indeed, a factor becomes relevant only because it has some connection to the issue at hand. The very foundation of the Gates totality test is the recognition that all relevant factors go into the probable cause mix.\nApplying this standard to the matter sub judice and in light of the certified record on appeal, we observe the following. The evidence at the suppression hearing established that Officer Ortiz was a nine-year veteran of the police force who was on undercover patrol in a high crime area that had been designated by the Philadelphia Police Department as an Operation Safe Streets neighborhood. In addition to this designation by the department, Officer Ortiz was personally familiar with heroin sales activity in the neighborhood, heroin packaging, and hand-to-hand drug exchanges on the street. In drawing a nexus between his experience and the observation he made, Officer Ortiz testified that he had seen this type of \u201cexchange done several hundred times\u201d on the street and had made several hundred narcotics arrests of this very type.\nBecause we have determined that a police officer\u2019s experience may be fairly regarded as a relevant factor in determining probable cause, and due to the presence of additional factors in support of Officer Ortiz\u2019s conclusion that he was witnessing a drug transaction, we find no error in the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that probable cause was present in this case. We do not base our decision solely on Officer Ortiz\u2019s experience and the connection he articulated between that experience and what he observed. We also rely on the fact that the transaction at issue occurred in the nighttime hours, on the street, in a neighborhood that the police department selected for the \u201cOperation Safe Streets\u201d program. We conclude that the Superior Court properly upheld the denial of suppression in this case and properly affirmed the judgment of sentence.\nThe second issue certified for our review concerns the treatment to be accorded this Court\u2019s per curiam decisions citing to Banks. Appellant asserts that these decisions are precedential and controlling authority. Appellant makes this argument based on what he characterizes as this Court\u2019s \u201cimplicit\u201d direction. The Commonwealth responds by relying on this Court\u2019s prior holdings that per curiam decisions do not constitute controlling authority.\nAppellant draws our attention to Commonwealth v. Fowler, 550 Pa. 152, 703 A.2d 1027 (1997) (plurality), wherein the lead opinion referred to a per curiam decision as one carrying \u201cthe weight of binding precedent.\u201d Id. at 1031. Appellant also refers to the concurring opinion in Nominating Petition of Benninghoff, 578 Pa. 402, 852 A.2d 1182 (2004), which noted that an unexplained per cunam decision unaccompanied by any citation to authority has no precedential value. Id. at 1191 (Castille, J., concurring).\nNone of the cases upon which Appellant relies can support his argument. Fowler, as a plurality decision, is not binding authority. Appellant\u2019s citation to Benninghoff not only references a non-binding concurring opinion, but attempts to expand significantly the observation in that expression to convert into binding precedent all per curiam decisions that include a citation to authority. This would fly in the face of this Court\u2019s frequent, clear, and unequivocal statements that the legal significance of per curiam decisions is limited to setting out the law of the case. This Court has made it clear that per curiam orders have no stare decisis effect. Commonwealth v. Dickson, 591 Pa. 364, 918 A.2d 95, 108 n. 14 (2007). See also Commonwealth v. Smith, 575 Pa. 203, 836 A.2d 5, 17 (2003) (concluding with certainty that a per curiam order that includes a citation to binding authority is not itself controlling and \u201cestablishes no precedent beyond the authority cited in the order\u201d); Commonwealth v. Tilghman, 543 Pa. 578, 673 A.2d 898, 904 (1996) (holding that only if a per curiam order expressly affirms on the basis of the lower court opinion does the order have precedential force).\nThe rationale for declining to deem per cunam decisions precedential is both simple and compelling. Such orders do not set out the facts and procedure of the case nor do they afford the bench and bar the benefit of the Court\u2019s rationale. These inadequacies are manifest in the arguments Appellant makes in his brief to this Court. In attempting to support his position on the probable cause issue discussed above, Appellant repeatedly relies on several of this Court\u2019s per curiam decisions, all of which cite Banks. But in order to draw analogies between those per curiam decisions and his own circumstances, Appellant relies on the facts recited by the Superior Court or by the author of a dissenting statement to an order granting allowance of appeal. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 16-18. Of course, such facts have not been adopted or even mentioned by this Court in its per curiam dispositions and Appellant has no way of knowing whether or to what extent any member of this Court relied on such facts to resolve the case in the manner it did. See Smith, 836 A.2d at 17 (\u201c[T]here is no reason to conclude that the Justices who agreed on [the per curiam ] mandate accepted the dissenters\u2019 view of the facts, the procedural posture of the case, [or] the issue presented.\u201d).\nAppellant\u2019s final argument on this issue is that \u201cthere is something inappropriate about a lower court disregarding entirely decisions of the highest court in the Commonwealth.\u201d We strongly disagree with this characterization. In Smith, Tilghman, and a host of other cases, this Court has explicitly directed the lower courts to regard per curiam decisions as non-precedential for the reasons articulated above. The lower courts\u2019 compliance with such direction is wholly appropriate.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices EAKIN and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a concurring opinion in which Justices EAKIN and McCAFFERY join.\nJustice BAER files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\nJustice TODD files a dissenting opinion.\n. Appellant states that while police may have had reasonable suspicion that some criminal activity may have been afoot, thus \u201cwarranting either further observations or possibly a Teny stop,\u201d there was not sufficient probable cause to warrant the \"full-blown seizure and search\" that occurred in this case. Appellant's Brief at 19.\n. As we observe infra, at notes 6 and 9, Appellant's reliance on Lawson as mandating reversal is misplaced.\n. At the time the trial and intermediate appellate courts confronted the issue in the instant case, this Court had not yet published its opinion in Dunlap. Thus, the Superior Court's opinion in Dunlap, which held that police experience was a factor relevant to probable cause, guided both lower courts.\n. This position comported, in part, with that of the dissenting justices, who would have found the probable cause standard satisfied and affirmed the judgment of sentence. Dunlap, 941 A.2d at 682-84 (Castille, J., dissenting) and at 685 (Eakin, J., dissenting).\n. The officer in Dunlap testified to his numbers of years on the police force (almost five), his time on the narcotics strike force (about nine months), and the number of narcotics arrests he had made (about fifteen or twenty). 941 A.2d at 680-81 (Saylor, J., concurring).\n. Appellant also argues that reversal is warranted because the Lawson factors were not met. Appellant's argument in this regard relies solely on the fact that Officer Ortiz did not observe multiple transactions in this case. But Lawson did not require observation of multiple transactions for probable cause. Rather, it noted that observation of multiple transactions was one of six factors present in that case and, further, that all relevant factors are included in the probable cause inquiry'. Lawson, 309 A.2d at 394.\n. The Commonwealth asserts that the \"disagreement [among the justices] in Dunlap concerned whether the police officer, at the suppression hearing, must establish a 'nexus\u2019 between his experience and the observed transaction.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Brief at 14 n. 7.\n. Insofar as the Dunlap majority holds otherwise, it is expressly disapproved. The dissent suggests that we are \"discarding\u201d the precedent articulated in Dunlap, despite the fact that the Dunlap majority \u201ccommanded the complete agreement of four justices\u201d and so \"remains the clear and controlling statement of the law\u201d with respect to whether a police officer's experience may be regarded a relevant factor in the probable cause inquiry. Dissenting Opinion at 235, 985 A.2d at 951-52. Respectfully, we cannot agree that the Dunlap decision is so clear-cut. While three justices of this Court indeed joined the majority expression in Dunlap, two of those justices also joined the concurring expression, which itself explicitly adopted the dissenting view on this precise issue. See Dunlap, 941 A.2d at 679 (Saylor, J., concurring) (\"Like [dissenting justice] Mr. Justice Eakin, I believe that a police officer's experience may fairly be regarded as a relevant factor in determining probable cause\u201d). In light of Dunlap's various expressions and votes thereon, and considering the majority\u2019s uncertain rationale described above, we conclude that the Dunlap majority is decidedly not a clear and controlling statement of the law.\n. The dissent relies heavily on this Court\u2019s Lawson decision in support of its claim that an officer's experience is not a factor affecting probable cause. See Dissenting Opinion at 227, 985 A.2d at 946 (\"conspicuously absent from [Lawson\u2019s] list of ... circumstances is the subjective opinion of the police officer, standing alone ... based solely upon his or her general police training, or past observations of other transactions.\u201d). First, we do not hold that probable cause may be based on a police officer's subjective opinion standing alone. Rather, we conclude that a police officer\u2019s experience is a relevant factor in the probable cause inquiry as long as it has specific application to the circumstances at hand. Moreover, the dissent\u2019s reliance on Lawson in this context is flawed. Lawson does not set out an exhaustive list of all possible factors affecting probable cause; it sets out a list of the factors present in that case. That Lawson, decided over 35 years ago, did not discuss the arresting officer's experience in drug trafficking does not mean that this Court deemed such experience irrelevant. Lawson sets a fundamental standard that makes this fact clear. \"All of the detailed facts and circumstances must be considered ... Considering the facts and circumstances in their totality, we conclude that the officers acted as prudent men in believing that some type of contraband was being sold---- [T]he total facts and circumstances in this case furnished a reasonable basis for the arrest.\u201d 309 A.2d at 394.\n. The dissent repeatedly characterizes Officer Ortiz's experience regarding the neighborhood as subjective, thereby minimizing it. Dissenting Opinion at 230; 238; and 241, 985 A.2d at 948; 952; and 955 (noting the officer\u2019s \"opinion of the nature of the neighborhood,\u201d \u201chis perspective regarding the nature of the neighborhood as a 'high crime drug location,\u2019 \" and his \"subjective belief ... [based on] past individual experiences\u201d) (emphasis supplied). This personally held view, the dissent reasons, combined with the officer's prior observations of drug transactions just like this one, were \"rooted in past unrelated events, and do not, in and of themselves, establish a fair probability that this particular transaction was criminal in nature, absent other surrounding indicia of criminality.\u201d Dissenting Opinion at 238, 985 A.2d at 952. We note our disagreement with the dissent\u2019s reasoning on two distinct grounds. To begin, it was not only Officer Ortiz\u2019s personal experience that the neighborhood he was patrolling was one that involved frequent drug trafficking, although the officer, in light of his experience in this area, clearly held such an opinion. Instead, the area had been designated as an Operation Safe Streets neighborhood. Thus, the Philadelphia Police Department had reached the conclusion, independent of any one officer\u2019s personal \u201copinion\" or \"perspective,\u201d that the neighborhood was a dangerous one. Secondly, we respectfully disagree that a neighborhood\u2019s designation as dangerous and an officer\u2019s prior observations of drug transactions there are somehow irrelevant as \"rooted in past unrelated events.\u201d Police officers patrolling our streets and endeavoring to keep our citizens safe are wise to pay close attention to every detail of their surroundings. It is simply illogical to ignore those details, or to conclude that an officer\u2019s experience regarding them is not a \"relevant factor\u201d informing the probable cause inquiry.\n. We are aware that Justice Saylor\u2019s concurring opinion in Dunlap addresses the weight to be attributed to testimony about high-crime neighborhoods in cases such as these. On this issue, Justice Saylor suggests that \u2019\u2019in the absence of some particular circumstance that does not substantially overlap with legitimate behavior ... the high-drug-activity location factor should [not] be given the sort of weight which would tip the totality scales in favor of finding probable cause....\u201d 941 A.2d at 681 (Saylor, J., concurring). Justice Saylor\u2019s position on this issue has not been adopted by this Court. Moreover, this issue has not been briefed by the parties and is not the subject of this appeal. Nonetheless, we note that the circumstances surrounding the transaction here \u2014 a small packet exchanged for money from a pedestrian to a driver at night on a street corner in a manner consistent with hundreds of prior drug transactions \u2014 do not constitute a substantial overlap with legitimate behavior. We conclude that the additional fact that the neighborhood in question had been specially designated by the police department is a relevant factor. Moreover, contrary to Justice Baer\u2019s Concurring and Dissenting Opinion in this case, our conclusion does not elevate this factor above any other relevant factor. Instead, in keeping with the totality standard in Gates, we conclude that all of the circumstances surrounding the transaction at issue combined to establish probable cause.\n. Indeed, the Benninghoff concurrence upon which Appellant relies explicitly notes that in rendering a per curiam affirmance, this Court does \u201cnot affirm the opinion below or the rationale it expressed.\u201d 852 A.2d at 1190 (Castille, J., concurring)."}
