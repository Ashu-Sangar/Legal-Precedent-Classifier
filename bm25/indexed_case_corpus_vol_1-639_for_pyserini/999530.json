{"id": "999530", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe limit of the defendant\u2019s liability under the terms of the insurance policy was the actual cash, value of the building insured, not in any event to exceed \u201c What it would cost the insured to repair or replace the same with materials of like kind and quality.\u201d It is urged that the use of the word \u201c restore \u201d instead of the word \u201c repair \u201d in the charge may have niisled the jury as to the measure of damages. If counsel thought the use of the word was objectionable, they should have called the attention of the court to it at the time. At most it was an inadvertent error which would have been corrected. \u201c A party may not sit silent and take his chances of a verdict, and then if it is adverse complain of'a matter which if an error would have been immediately rectified and made harmless: \u201d Commonwealth v. Razmus, 210 Pa. 609. The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment - is affirmed.'"}
