{"id": "1896834", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nPetitioner challenges his 1960 conviction in reliance on the decision in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S. Ct. 1758 (1964), and Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 77 S. Ct. 1356 (1957). He further alleges a pretrial deprivation of the right to counsel on the basis of the decision in White v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 59, 83 S. Ct. 1050 (1963).\nWe find no merit in petitioner\u2019s contentions. Having concluded in Commonwealth v. Negri, 419 Pa. 117, 213 A. 2d 670 (1965), that the mandate of Escobedo is not to be given retrospective application, Negri is here controlling. Petitioner\u2019s contention in reliance on Mallory is foreclosed by our decision in Commonwealth ex rel. Sleighter v. Banmiller, 392 Pa. 133, 139 A. 2d 918 (1958).\nFinally, the record fails to disclose any prejudice arising from petitioner\u2019s lack of counsel at the preliminary hearing and, therefore, no violation of his constitutional rights resulted. See Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, 416 Pa. 321, 206 A. 2d 283 (1965).\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Cohen dissents.\nCf. Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 81 S. Ct. 1860 (1961); Gallegos v. Nebraska, 342 U.S. 55, 72 S. Ct. 141 (1951)."}
