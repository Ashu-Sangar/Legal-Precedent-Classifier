L. 345, which appellant urges are mandatory on the court to issue the writ, \u201c if such petition presents the substance of a case for mandamus.\u201d\nThe petition, however, did not present a case for mandamus, inasmuch as it sets forth the right claimed as based exclusively on petitioner\u2019s compliance with the terms of the Act of April 3, 1872, P. L. 843. The court was entitled to take judicial notice that the granting of licenses is now regulated by the Act of May 13, 1887, P. L. 108, compliance with the requirements of which was not alleged.\nAppeal dismissed with costs."}
