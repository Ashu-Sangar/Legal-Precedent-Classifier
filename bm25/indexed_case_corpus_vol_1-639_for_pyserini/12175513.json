The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n(1) Does the Superior Court\u2019s decision, which refused to compel arbitration of the arbitrable survival claim, violate the Federal Arbitration Act requirement that arbitration agreements \u201cshall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable save upon grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract?\u201d\n(2) Does the Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 213(e), require the consolidation of the otherwise arbitrable survival action with the non-arbitrable wrongful death action on grounds of efficiency violate the Federal Arbitration Act as it has been interpreted by the United States Supreme Court which has consistently ruled that arbitration is required when there is an agreement to arbitrate even when compelling arbitration results in duplication and piecemeal litigation?"}
