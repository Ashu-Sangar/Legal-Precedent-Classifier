{"id": "687727", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice CASTILLE.\nThis is a direct appeal from the sentence of death imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. Appellant\u2019s convictions in the instant case stem from his rampage on March 1, 2000, which began with the arson of his apartment building; resulted in the killing of three people and the maiming of two others; and culminated in a standoff with police at a medical care facility.\nAppellant was arrested and charged in connection with his crimes, and he was initially adjudicated incompetent to stand trial by order of the Honorable Jeffrey A. Manning, Jr., dated April 25, 2000. The order directed that appellant be committed to Mayview State Hospital for treatment and evaluation and that he be appropriately medicated until becoming competent.\nOn June 28, 2000, the Commonwealth petitioned the court to permit its psychiatric expert, Dr. Michael Weiner, to have access to appellant\u2019s Mayview medical records and also to have access and opportunity to interview appellant and any Mayview professional or para-professional staff. The trial court granted that motion on June 30, 2000, and in the following days, Dr. Weiner interviewed a variety of medical personnel from both Mayview Hospital and St. Francis Hospital, where appellant had received medical treatment from 1990 to 1999. In addition, Dr. Weiner reviewed appellant\u2019s medical records from Mayview Hospital and interviewed appellant on July 4, 2000. In a letter to the trial court dated July 6, 2000, Dr. Weiner informed the court, in detail, that in his opinion appellant was competent to stand to trial. On July 28, 2000, the trial court issued an order directing the Department of Corrections and Mayview Hospital to produce appellant for trial.\nThe matter was transferred to the Honorable Lawrence J. O\u2019Toole, and present counsel, John Elash, Esq., was appointed in November of 2000 to represent appellant at trial. Public Defender Lisa Middleman, Esq., assisted in appellant\u2019s representation. On April 19, 2001, counsel filed a Notice of Intent to Pursue an Insanity Defense. On May 7, 2001, the trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition to allow Dr. Weiner access to appellant in order to conduct a psychiatric evaluation regarding appellant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the crime.\nDr. Weiner attempted to interview appellant on May 19 and 20, 2001, but appellant refused to cooperate. Consequently, on May 21, 2001, the Commonwealth filed a motion with the trial court ordering appellant to cooperate with the interviewing process, in which the Commonwealth requested that the court \u201cconduct a colloquy with [appellant] to advise him to cooperate and participate in the interviewing process in a meaningful manner,\u201d and that the court \u201cadvise [appellant] that his failure to cooperate in a meaningful manner will result in excluding evidence of any mental infirmity defense or mitigation at any stage of these proceedings.\u201d Commonwealth Motion, 5/21/01, at \u00b6\u00b6 6-7. The trial court held a hearing on that same date, at which the court heard testimony from Dr. Weiner, who stated that although appellant\u2019s medical history records were available for review, it was necessary for him to interview appellant in order to form an opinion on his mental status at the time of the crime. Following the testimony, the court issued an order directing that appellant cooperate with the interview process.\nOn the morning of May 22, 2001, Dr. Weiner interviewed appellant for several hours, but appellant refused to continue the interview session in the afternoon. At a hearing held that afternoon, Dr. Weiner testified that he needed approximately 15 hours of total interview time and still needed a \u201cconsiderable amount of time\u201d with appellant. N.T., 5/22/01, at 5, 8. The court directed the interview process to continue that evening and the next day if necessary.\nDuring the afternoon of the next day, May 23, the court held yet another hearing, at which the Commonwealth complained that appellant had refused to cooperate on the evening prior and had been only \u201csuperficially cooperative\u201d that morning, providing answers such as \u201c[n]o comment,\u201d and \u201c[t]hat\u2019s a stupid question.\u201d N.T., 5/23/01, at 20. Defense counsel countered that appellant, in fact, had been complying with the court\u2019s order. After hearing testimony from Dr. Weiner in support of the Commonwealth\u2019s position, the court conducted a record colloquy of appellant to ensure that he understood his duty to comply in order to be able to pursue an insanity defense. Appellant evidenced his understanding, and the court thereafter permitted Dr. Weiner to continue the interview process.\nOn May 24, 2001, the court held another hearing, making record note of the fact that Dr. Weiner had ceased the interview process at around 5 p.m. on May 23, and that the Commonwealth sought additional interview time for May 25. The court again agreed to oversee the interview process, but defense counsel informed the court that he would instruct appellant not to answer any further questions. At a hearing on the following morning, May 25, 2001, defense counsel reiterated his position that appellant had been cooperative up to that point and that he would instruct appellant not to answer any further questions. Later that same day, the court issued an order, in which it noted that it had compelled appellant to participate in a psychiatric examination; that Dr. Weiner had, in fact, examined appellant for a total of six to eight hours; and that appellant had substantially complied with the examination process. Thus, the order denied the Commonwealth\u2019s request to bar appellant from raising the defense of insanity.\nOn May 31, 2001, the court issued an order directing that all proceedings in the matter be stayed pending disposition of the Commonwealth\u2019s request for permission to appeal the trial court\u2019s order. Thereafter, the Superior Court denied the Commonwealth\u2019s Petition for Permission to Appeal on August 8, 2001, and this Court denied a Petition for Permission to Appeal on October 4, 2001.\nAppellant\u2019s trial commenced on November 1, 2001 and the jury convicted appellant of, inter alia, three counts of first-degree murder, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a). On November 11, 2001, after a penalty phase hearing at which appellant continued to be represented by Attorneys Elash and Middleman, the jury found one aggravating circumstance as to each murder, and one or more jurors found the existence of one mitigating circumstance as to each murder. The jury unanimously concluded that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors, and accordingly, returned three sentences of death. On January 11, 2002, the trial court formally imposed the sentences of death and also imposed an aggregate, consecutive sentence of 115 to 230 years of imprisonment on the remaining convictions. Notice of automatic appeal was filed on February 8, 2002.\nPursuant to the trial court\u2019s order, appellant filed a Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal. On January 23, 2003, the trial court filed an opinion addressing the claims raised by appellant on appeal.\nI. Sufficiency of the Evidence\nWe turn first, as we do in all capital direct appeals, to our review of the evidence to ensure that it is sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions for first-degree murder. Commonwealth v. Zettlemoyer, 500 Pa. 16, 454 A.2d 937, 942 n. 3 (1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 970, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327 (1983). We do so notwithstanding that appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence. Commonwealth v. Freeman, 573 Pa. 532, 827 A.2d 385 (2003). When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, this Court must determine whether the evidence at trial, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, are sufficient to establish each element of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Bridges, 563 Pa. 1, 757 A.2d 859, 864 (2000). A person is guilty of first-degree murder where the Commonwealth proves that (1) a human being was unlawfully killed; (2) the person accused is responsible for the killing; and (3) the accused acted with specific intent to kill. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(d); Commonwealth v. Spotz, 563 Pa. 269, 759 A.2d 1280, 1283 (2000). An intentional killing is a \u201c [killing by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(d). Specific intent to kill can be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the victim\u2019s body. Commonwealth v. Fletcher, 561 Pa. 266, 750 A.2d 261, 267 (2000).\nThe evidence adduced at trial established the following. On March 1, 2000, two white maintenance workers, John Kroll and John DeWitt, were replacing the door to appellant\u2019s apartment in a building located at 1208 Wood Street, Wilkins-burg, which is in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Appellant, who is black, grew angry because he thought that Kroll and DeWitt were taking too long. Appellant called DeWitt a \u201cracist white pig\u201d and \u201cdirty white trash,\u201d and DeWitt replied by stating that people like appellant are the cause of racial tension. N.T., 11/1/01, at 88. As DeWitt kneeled, picking up his tools from the floor in the hallway outside appellant\u2019s apartment, appellant stood directly over him. Because appellant looked angry, DeWitt rose to his feet with a hammer held at his side. Appellant asked: \u201cYou think you\u2019re pretty tough?\u201d Appellant walked away but then returned and stated to DeWitt, \u201cYou\u2019re a dead man ... You have to come back to this building ... You\u2019re a dead man.\u201d N.T., 11/1/01, at 91-92. DeWitt and Kroll then went to the apartment building\u2019s basement, at which point DeWitt left Kroll to attend to another resident\u2019s maintenance request. Kroll remained in the basement with another maintenance worker, Andrew Williams, who is black.\nFollowing the confrontation with DeWitt, appellant returned to his apartment, where he retrieved a .22 caliber revolver and placed it in a small pouch along with numerous loose rounds of ammunition. Appellant then set his couch on fire with lighter fluid and exited the apartment, leaving the door open. The fire spread to the ceiling and into the hallway, but firefighters were able to subdue the blaze. No one was injured as a result.\nImmediately after setting his couch on fire, appellant began to search the apartment building for DeWitt. When appellant came upon Kroll and Williams in the basement, appellant shouted, \u201cWhere are you, mother fucker, I\u2019m going to get you. I got something for you.\u201d N.T., 11/1/01, at 112. Williams noticed the brown pouch in appellant\u2019s hand, and both Williams and Kroll pleaded with appellant not to do anything rash. Appellant then pulled the pistol from his pouch, repeating the threat, \u201cI got something for you,\u201d and began looking in the boiler room, where he apparently expected to find DeWitt. N.T., 11/1/01, at 114. Unsuccessful in locating DeWitt, appellant exited the building, with Kroll and Williams following and pleading with appellant not to do anything rash. Appellant stopped, turned, and fired one shot into Kroll\u2019s chest, killing him and leaving Williams unharmed.\nAppellant then walked to a nearby Burger King restaurant. He entered the restaurant, walked past the counter, turned, and walked over to where Joseph Healy, a 71-year-old white male, was sitting in a booth. Without a word, appellant shot Healy at point-blank range in the back of the head, killing him.\nAppellant then left the Burger King, and began walking a short distance toward the entrance to a nearby McDonald\u2019s restaurant. Richard Clinger, a white male, was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of his van, which was parked in the McDonald\u2019s lot. Appellant approached the van, pointed his gun through the partially opened driver side window, and shot Clinger in the head. Appellant then entered the McDonald\u2019s and walked behind the counter into the food preparation area. There he found the store manager, Stephen Bostard, another white male. Appellant placed his revolver to Bostard\u2019s temple and shot him next to his right ear. Both Clinger and Bostard survived but were severely injured as a result of their wounds.\nNext, appellant exited the McDonald\u2019s and walked along the line of cars that sat idling in the drive-thru line, peering into some of the cars. Appellant peered into Emil Sanielevici\u2019s car through the passenger side window and then began to walk away. Sanieleviei lowered the window and inquired what appellant wanted. Appellant responded: \u201cWhat do I want? What do I want?\u201d and then walked to the driver\u2019s side of Sanielevici\u2019s car. N.T., 11/2/01, at 249. From less than two feet away, appellant shot Sanieleviei in his forehead, killing him.\nThereafter, appellant walked to a nearby apartment building located at 416 Ross Street, and began walking up the entrance stairs. While on the stairs, appellant encountered a tenant of the building, Ronald Washington, who is black. Appellant instructed Washington to \u201ccome here,\u201d but Washington refused when he noticed the gun in appellant\u2019s hand. Appellant assured him that, \u201cthis isn\u2019t for you ... it was for these crackers.\u201d N.T., 11/5/01, at 379-80. After reloading his gun on the stairs, appellant made his way into the apartment of Christine McCrae, a black woman, who lived on the ground floor and had left her back door open. Appellant instructed McCrae to be quiet and assured her that he would only remain for a few minutes while he collected himself. McCrae later testified that appellant \u201cjust said he was just out to get white people.\u201d N.T., 11/2/01, at 287. Appellant asked McCrae if she had any guns or a car, and she replied that she did not. Appellant then asked McCrae if any white people lived in the building, to which McCrae replied that she did not know. Appellant kissed McCrae on the forehead and left the apartment.\nIn response to a police radio call, Wilkinsburg Police Officers Daniel Ciuffe and Michael Mincin were driving in a marked police cruiser through Wilkinsburg in search of the shooting suspect, when they saw appellant crossing the street. Not yet realizing that appellant was their suspect, the officers stopped the car to let him pass, at which point he turned and fired three shots in the direction of their patrol car. Appellant then fled into the nearby Penn West Building, where he walked into the offices of the Metro Family medical practice.\nAppellant encountered Patricia Papenmeir, a white female receptionist, whom he instructed to \u201cshh.\u201d N.T., 11/5/01, at 405. He inquired whether anyone else was in the office, and Papenmeir informed him that another woman was in the file room. Appellant grabbed Papenmeir and led her to the file room, where they found Debbie Nicomede, another white female employee. At some point, Joyce Ambrose, a white nurse at Metro Family, came upon the three and asked if appellant needed help. Looking at Bill Simmington, a black male employee who was nearby, appellant stated, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t know what time it is.\u201d N.T., 11/2/01, at 306. Appellant then led Papenmeir, Nicomede, and Ambrose down the hall at gunpoint, leaving behind Simmington and another black employee. Somewhere down the hallway, appellant announced to the three women: \u201cYou don\u2019t know how many people I\u2019ve killed. I just killed five people. I have one bullet left and I\u2019m going to use it on one of you. I just don\u2019t know which one it will be.\u201d N.T., 11/2/01, at 308. Appellant then waved the gun from one woman to the next, pointing it at their faces and foreheads. When Barbara Pippins, a black female employee of Metro family, inadvertently walked into the hallway where appellant and the three women stood, appellant told Pippins, \u201cYou\u2019re okay sister. Get out of here.\u201d N.T., 11/5/01, at 414. Then, seemingly having decided to shoot Ms. Nicomede, appellant pointed the gun at her head and said, \u201cYou look like a smart white bitch.\u201d However, he then lowered the gun, grabbed Nicomede by the arm and said, \u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll terrorize you for a while. Come on.\u201d N.T., 11/2/01, at 311. Nicomede pleaded with appellant, who then dropped her arm and walked into an examination room, where appellant aimed his gun at Dr. David Freeman, who retreated to another room. While appellant was looking for Dr. Freeman, everyone in the hallway was able to escape.\nPolice Officer Paul Tomko, who had responded to the scene from a nearby township, confronted appellant inside the Penn West Building while the officer was attempting to evacuate the building\u2019s occupants. A stand-off ensued, in which appellant pointed his gun at the police and at himself intermittently. Appellant repeatedly inquired how many people had died that day and talked about racism and God. During the following hours, Police Sergeant John Fisher, a negotiations specialist, talked with appellant. When asked about what happened that day, appellant, apparently referring to Mr. DeWitt, responded: \u201c[T]hat God-damned J.D.....He pushed me too far today. He went ... overboard. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore ... that white mother fucker.\u201d Appellant later admitted to setting his apartment on fire and told Sergeant Fisher: \u201cYou tell J.D. that he\u2019s lucky that I didn\u2019t get him today. He\u2019s lucky he got away.\u201d N.T., 11/5/01, at 435, 444.\nAppellant eventually surrendered and was immediately transported to the police station, where a large media presence had gathered. Before walking past the media, one officer asked appellant whether he wanted anything to cover his face, to which appellant responded: \u201cI\u2019m proud of what I did. I don\u2019t need anything to cover my face.\u201d N.T., 11/5/01, at 527-28. Appellant also commented that he should have killed himself because he did not want to spend the rest of his life in jail.\nThe foregoing evidence was amply sufficient to permit the jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that appellant intentionally, deliberately, and with premeditation killed Mr. Kroll, Mr. Healy, and Mr. Sanielevici. Each of these victims was unlawfully killed; appellant committed the killings; and the mere fact that appellant shot Kroll in the chest and Healy and Sanielevici in the head was sufficient to permit the jury to find a specific intent to kill. Additional evidence of appellant\u2019s specific intent to kill included the statements he made, indicating, among other things, his dislike for white people, during the course of his rampage.\nWe now turn to the claims raised by appellant, one of which arises from the guilt phase of the trial and the remaining three of which arise from the penalty phase. We will discuss the claims in order.\nII. Guilt Phase\nAppellant\u2019s sole guilt-phase claim is that the trial court erred by denying his request to charge the jury on diminished capacity and third-degree murder when, in appellant\u2019s view, the evidence adduced at trial \u201cclearly challenged [appellant\u2019s] capacity to possess the requisite mens rea for first-degree murder.\u201d Appellant urges that although he knew the difference between right and wrong and was competent to stand trial, he had a diminished capacity \u201cto understand and process information, to communicate, to abstract from mistakes, to learn from experience, to engage in logical reasoning, to control impulses, and to understand others\u2019 reaction[s].\u201d In support of this argument, appellant cites to his psychiatric expert\u2019s \u201cvoluminous psychiatric testimony explaining appellant\u2019s psychoses and mental diseases.\u201d Appellant posits that, had the jury been instructed as to diminished capacity, they would have considered that appellant was \u201ca psychotic man who manifested his paranoid schizophrenia through a lifetime of bizarre rituals and practices that culminated on March 1, 2000.\u201d Appellant concludes that his psychiatric evidence \u201cwould have served to negate the element of specific intent and ... resulted in a verdict of Third-Degree Murder.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 12-13.\nThe Commonwealth counters that neither instruction was required and that the defense of diminished capacity was unavailable to appellant in light of the evidence, presented by the Commonwealth and confirmed by appellant\u2019s own psychiatric expert, that appellant was capable of forming the specific intent to kill. The trial court, in its Pa.R.A.P.1925(a) opinion, concluded that \u201cSufficient evidence was not presented at trial that would have provided a rational basis for the Court to instruct the jury on either third-degree murder or diminished capacity.\u201d\nIt is settled that \u201ca trial court should not instruct the jury on legal principles which have no application to the facts presented at trial.\u201d Commonwealth v. White, 490 Pa. 179, 415 A.2d 399, 400 (1980). Rather, there \u201cmust be some relationship between the evidence presented and the law upon which an instruction is requested.\u201d Commonwealth v. Crews, 536 Pa. 508, 640 A.2d 395, 407 (1994). The reason for this rule is that, \u201cinstructing the jury on legal principles that cannot rationally be applied to the facts presented at trial may confuse them and place obstacles in the path of a just verdict.\u201d White, 415 A.2d at 400. Accordingly, a criminal defendant must establish that the trial evidence would \u201creasonably support\u201d a verdict based on the desired charge and may not claim entitlement to an instruction that has no basis in the evidence presented during trial. Commonwealth v. Carter, 502 Pa. 433, 466 A.2d 1328, 1332-33 (1983).\nFurthermore, specific intent to kill is what distinguishes first-degree murder from other lesser types of murder. See Commonwealth v. Fletcher, 861 A.2d 898, 907 (Pa. 2004). A non-felony murder committed with malice, but without specific intent, constitutes a third-degree murder. See Commonwealth v. Meadows, 567 Pa. 344, 787 A.2d 312, 317 (2001).\nThis Court first recognized the viability of diminished capacity as a defense to first-degree murder in Commonwealth v. Walzack, 468 Pa. 210, 360 A.2d 914 (1976). There, the defense conceded that the defendant had committed the killing but attempted to offer into evidence testimony from both the defendant and a psychiatric expert that would tend to show that, due to a previous brain surgery, a frontal lobotomy, the defendant did not possess the mental capacity to form the specific intent to kill at the time of the crime. The trial court refused to permit such testimony, and the defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, this Court concluded that the defense of diminished capacity is cognizable in Pennsylvania and reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude the proffered psychiatric evidence. Noting that the Commonwealth must prove each element of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt, including specific intent to kill in the case of first-degree murder, the Court reasoned that expert testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s mental capacity to form specific intent \u201cobviously would have \u2018significantly advanced the inquiry\u2019 as to the presence or absence of an essential element of the crime.\u201d Id. at 918 (quoting Commonwealth v. Hickman, 453 Pa. 427, 309 A.2d 564, 567 (1973)). Moreover, the Court rejected the argument that policy reasons should bar the use of the defense and held accordingly that the psychiatric evidence in question was relevant as it bore upon an element of the offense charged and should have been admitted. Walzack, 360 A.2d at 921.\nWhile the diminished capacity doctrine has not changed significantly since Walzack and is now well-recognized as a permissible defense to first-degree murder in an appropriate case, this Court has admonished that the defense is an extremely limited one. See Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 541 Pa. 108, 661 A.2d 352, 359 n. 10 (1995). Diminished capacity is directed exclusively at the negation of specific intent, and therefore, to be admissible, evidence of the defense must necessarily put into question the criminal defendant\u2019s very ability to form the intent to kill. See Walzack, 360 A.2d at 916 n. 6 (\u201cthe thrust of the doctrine relates to the accused\u2019s ability to perform a specified cognitive process.\u201d). Accordingly, we have repeatedly rejected the contention that evidence of a defendant\u2019s supposed inability to control his actions\u2014by virtue of an \u201cirresistible impulse,\u201d a \u201ccompulsion,\u201d or otherwise-is relevant to negate specific intent, and we have consistently held that such evidence may not be admitted in support of a diminished capacity defense. See Travaglia, 661 A.2d at 360 (diminished capacity defense could not be supported by argument that defendant could not control his actions); Zettlemoyer, 454 A.2d at 949 (where entire defense was \u201cinfested\u201d with language of \u201cirresistible impulse,\u201d trial court was correct to inform jury that such language did not bear upon diminished capacity defense; and commenting in dicta that trial court would not have been in error to deny charge on diminished capacity altogether); Commonwealth v. Weinstein, 499 Pa. 106, 451 A.2d 1344, 1350 (1982) (psychiatric testimony indicating that defendant had compulsion or irresistible impulse to kill is irrelevant to question of specific intent to kill and, therefore, inadmissible).\nIn the instant case, appellant called Dr. Horacio Fabrega to testify in support of his insanity defense. Dr. Fabrega did not specifically testily to appellants alleged diminished capacity, much less did he offer an opinion that appellant lacked the capacity to form the specific intent to kill. However, certain portions of Dr. Fabrega\u2019s testimony are enlightening as to diminished capacity, albeit not in a way that supports appellants argument. For instance, when asked by trial counsel if he had an opinion as to whether appellant was insane at the time of the shootings, Dr. Fabrega launched into an extensive narrative, during which he commented, inter alia, that, \u201cessentially [appellant] was, from my formulation, thrown into a psychotic storm of discontrol where he was intending to\u2014 where he intended to shoot Mr. DeWitt.\u201d When asked later to explain legal insanity, Dr. Fabrega stated, inter alia, that, \u201c[o]bviously [appellant] knew what he was doing. [H]e took a loaded gun. He aimed it. He had conversations with people. Later he selectively shot white people and not black people. So there was a deliberateness about that.\u201d N.T., 11/6/01, at 607, 609. Still later, Dr. Fabrega noted that, \u201csome of [appellants] behavior was deliberate. [I]t was deliberate in the sense that he didn\u2019t shoot women, it was deliberate in the sense that he didn\u2019t shoot black people. So he was obviously aware of what was happening.\u201d N.T., 6/11/01, at 614.\nFollowing the close of evidence, and prior to the trial courts charging of the jury, defense counsel requested that the court instruct the jury on diminished capacity and third-degree murder. The trial prosecutor responded that there was no evidence to support such jury charges, and that, to the contrary, the testimony from appellants own expert confirmed that appellant had the capacity to form a specific intent to kill. The trial court agreed and did not charge the jury on diminished capacity or third degree murder.\nOn appeal, appellant simply recites the two charges that he alleges should have been read to the jury but offers little persuasive legal analysis to explain why the evidence that was actually introduced warranted the requested instructions. The fact that appellants defense expert testified that appellant was psychotic and suffered from varying degrees of mental illness does not ineluctably suggest that he lacked the capacity to form a specific intent to kill. This Courts independent review reveals that all of the evidence admitted at trial\u2014 including evidence proffered by the defense\u2014demonstrated that appellant possessed the capacity to form a specific intent to kill. Moreover, it is worth noting that Dr. Fabrega\u2019s opinion that appellant entered into a \u201cpsychotic storm of discontrol\u201d harkens back to irresistible impulse, not diminished capacity; this Court has held that such evidence is irrelevant and inadmissible to prove diminished capacity. See Travaglia, 661 A.2d at 360. Accordingly, as the evidence did not warrant jury charges for third-degree murder and diminished capacity, the trial court did not err in denying trial counsels request for such charges.\nIII. Penalty Phase\nTurning to the penalty phase, appellant first claims that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting the Commonwealth\u2019s psychiatric expert, Dr. Michael Weiner, to testify in rebuttal. Appellant offers two distinct arguments in support of this claim: (1) that Dr. Weiner\u2019s examination of appellant in May of 2001 provided an insufficient and inadequate basis to support his expert testimony; and (2) that Dr. Weiner\u2019s testimony violated appellant\u2019s right to be free from self-incrimination and his right to counsel under both the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions.\nThe background for these arguments is as follows. As noted above, after appellant filed his notice of insanity defense, the Commonwealth was granted leave for Dr. Weiner to interview appellant for the purpose of forming an opinion as to appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the crime. Ultimately, the trial court rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s request that Dr. Weiner be afforded additional visits with appellant before finalizing his opinion, or in the alternative, that appellant should be barred from raising the defense of insanity. Instead, the trial court agreed with the defense that appellant had substantially complied with the court\u2019s previous order to cooperate with the interview process and that he would not be barred from raising an insanity defense. The Commonwealth\u2019s attempt to secure appellate review of that decision was denied.\nAccordingly, during the penalty hearing appellant presented evidence in support of the following two mitigating circumstances which he ultimately argued to the jury: (1) that he was under extreme mental or emotional disturbance, 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(2); and (2) that his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially impaired, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(3). Following the close of appellant\u2019s case, the Commonwealth called Dr. Weiner in rebuttal to challenge the existence of these mitigators. Appellant objected. Before ruling on the objections, the trial court permitted the prosecutor and defense counsel to examine Dr. Weiner outside the presence of the jury in order to ascertain, primarily, whether there was merit to appellant\u2019s constitutional claims.\nDefense counsel questioned Dr. Weiner regarding both his July 2000 competency examination and the sufficiency of his interview time with appellant in May 2001. As to the latter issue, the following exchange took place:\n[Defense counsel]: When you testified from that very chair that you could not give an opinion as to the mental state of [appellant] without additional time specifically with [appellant], was that not true?\nDr. Weiner: I\u2019d like to see a copy of my testimony so that I could\u2014\n[Defense counsel]: Sure.\nDr. Weiner: Thank you.\nThe Court: Wouldn\u2019t that part of his testimony go to its weight in front of the jury? I thought the concern was that there was a possibility that your client\u2019s Sixth Amendments [sic] rights had been violated.\n[Defense counsel]: That\u2019s true.\nThe Court: The doctor is not\u2014\n[Defense counsel]: I\u2019ll withdraw that. The court is absolutely correct.\nN.T., 11/10/01, at 1082.\nFollowing Dr. Weiner\u2019s testimony, the trial court overruled defense counsel\u2019s remaining constitutional objection and permitted the rebuttal testimony in the presence of the jury. Dr. Weiner then testified that, in his expert opinion, appellant was not under extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the crime and that appellant\u2019s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law was not substantially impaired.\nPresently, appellant reverses his earlier position, arguing that, because of the Commonwealth\u2019s repeated assertions to the trial court that the amount of time Dr. Weiner spent interviewing appellant during the period from May 19 to May 24, 2001 was insufficient to equip the doctor with the information necessary to opine on appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the crime, his testimony should have been excluded. The Commonwealth counters that appellant should not be granted relief upon a claim that he created by his own recalcitrance\u2014 i.e., his refusal to cooperate\u2014and that, in any event, the fact that Dr. Weiner did not secure as much cooperation from appellant as he would have liked did not preclude him from forming and rendering an opinion, the weight of which was for the jury. The Commonwealth submits that Dr. Weiner was able to form a professional diagnosis based upon the amount of time that he actually spent with appellant and the information that was available to him.\nWe note that, by withdrawing his line of cross-examination\u2014and implicitly, his objection\u2014concerning the amount of time that Dr. Weiner spent with appellant, counsel arguably failed to preserve his present argument. Freeman, 573 Pa. 532, 827 A.2d 385. However, the trial court twice stated that the objection was addressed to the weight of the evidence, rather than its admissibility, and it is at least arguable that those comments constituted an overruling of the objection and/or argument. See N.T., 11/10/01, at 1082, 1090. Moreover, the trial court later stated that counsel\u2019s \u201cobjection as to Doctor Weiner\u2019s testifying here as memorialized in [trial counsel\u2019s] written and/or oral comments is clearly protected on the record.\u201d N.T., 11/10/01, at 1092. Accordingly, we deem the argument to be preserved.\nThe admissibility of evidence, including rebuttal evidence, is a matter primarily falling within the discretionary powers of the trial court. Commonwealth v. Reid, 571 Pa. 1, 811 A.2d 530 (2002); Commonwealth v. Jones, 546 Pa. 161, 683 A.2d 1181 (1996). Contrary to appellant\u2019s insistence, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in deeming Dr. Weiner\u2019s testimony to be relevant and admissible rebuttal testimony. Whatever deficiency inhered in the substance of that testimony by virtue of appellant\u2019s non-cooperation, as the trial court aptly noted, was a matter for the jury to consider in weighing the value of the testimony, but it did not affect its admissibility. See N.T., 11/10/01, at 1090; see also Commonwealth v. McCrae, 574 Pa. 594, 832 A.2d 1026, 1035 (2003) (witness\u2019s testimonial inconsistencies created question of weight to be afforded testimony rather than admissibility); Commonwealth v. Fletcher, 561 Pa. 266, 750 A.2d 261, 277 (2000) (fact that eyewitness was smoking crack when she observed crime created question of weight rather than admissibility). Moreover, appellant cannot profit by his recalcitrance. After his refusal to cooperate further with Dr. Weiner, appellant argued that Dr. Weiner had sufficient access to appellant such as to render an expert opinion. Although the Commonwealth disputed the point, and unsuccessfully sought interlocutory review, the fact of the matter is that the controlling legal finding by the trial court in the case was that the expert received sufficient access to form an expert opinion. That finding binds appellant now no less than it bound the Commonwealth when it was rendered. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s challenge to the admissibility of Dr. Weiner\u2019s testimony based upon the alleged insufficiency of his examination must fail.\nIn the alternative, appellant argues that the doctor\u2019s testimony was inadmissible because it was based, at least in part, upon information gleaned from appellant during the doctor\u2019s competency evaluation in July of 2000, an evaluation which was not preceded by Miranda warnings and was conducted without affording appellant the benefit of counsel. Relying on Estelle v. Smith, 451 U.S. 454, 101 S.Ct. 1866, 68 L.Ed.2d 359 (1981), appellant reasons that the doctor\u2019s testimony violated the Fifth and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The Commonwealth responds that appellant waived his right to be free from self-incrimination because he raised a mental infirmity defense at trial. Moreover, the Commonwealth argues that the record shows that the entirety of Dr. Weiner\u2019s penalty phase rebuttal testimony was based upon information and sources independent of his competency examination of appellant. The trial court agreed with the Commonwealth that, \u201c[wjhere a defendant has raised a mental-status defense, that defendant does not have a right to raise a Fifth Amendment challenge to an examination by a Commonwealth psychiatrist.\u201d Slip op. at 6 (quoting Commonwealth v. Motley, 681 A.2d 1254, 1256 (1996)).\nIn Smith, the defendant was indicted for capital murder in Texas for his participation in an armed robbery of a grocery store during which the store clerk was fatally shot by the defendant\u2019s accomplice. Prior to trial, a court-appointed psychiatrist met with the defendant and concluded that he was competent to stand trial, reporting his findings to the court. Thereafter, the defendant was tried and convicted of murder. The case then proceeded to the penalty phase, during which the state called the court-appointed psychiatrist to testify regarding the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness which, at the time, was one of three factors required to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt to permit a sentence of death under the Texas death penalty statute. The expert, whose testimony was based entirely upon his pre-trial competency examination, testified that the defendant was a remorseless sociopath who would only get worse and could not be cured or effectively medicated. Following the hearing, the jury found all necessary factors beyond a reasonable doubt and sentenced the defendant to death. On direct appeal, the Texas courts affirmed and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari.\nThe defendant thereafter filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the federal district court, alleging that introduction of the state\u2019s psychiatric testimony violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights. The district court agreed and vacated the death sentence. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. On appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the challenged testimony violated the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and affirmed, holding that:\nA criminal defendant, who neither initiates a psychiatric evaluation nor attempts to introduce any psychiatric evidence, may not be compelled to respond to a psychiatrist if his statements can be used against him at a capital sentencing proceeding. Because [the defendant] did not voluntarily consent to the pretrial psychiatric examination after being informed of his right to remain silent and the possible use of his statements, the State could not rely on what he said to [the psychiatric expert] to establish his future dangerousness.\n451 U.S. at 468, 101 S.Ct. at 1876. The Court continued, hypothesizing that:\nIf, upon being adequately warned, [the defendant] had indicated that he would not answer [the expert\u2019s] questions, the validly ordered competency examination nevertheless could have proceeded upon the condition that the results would be applied solely for that purpose. In such circumstances, the proper conduct and use of competency and sanity examinations are not frustrated, but the State must make its case on future dangerousness in some other way.\nId. at 468-69, 101 S.Ct. at 1876. The Court emphasized that the Fifth Amendment requires the state to prove its case with evidence other than the results of a court-ordered competency examination where, prior to the examination, the defendant is either uninformed of his Fifth Amendment rights or where he is informed and does not waive them. Id. The Court further held that the challenged testimony violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel, reasoning that the defendant\u2019s choice of whether or not to comply with the competency examination was one that he should not have been forced to make without the \u201cguiding hand of counsel.\u201d Id. at 471, 101 S.Ct. at 1877 (citation omitted).\nLater, in Buchanan v. Kentucky, 483 U.S. 402, 107 S.Ct. 2906, 97 L.Ed.2d 336 (1987), the Supreme Court qualified its holding in Smith. In Buchanan, the prosecution, over the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment objection, was permitted to introduce evidence from a pre-trial psychiatric report as it pertained to the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the crime. Unlike defense counsel in Smith, however, Buchanan\u2019s attorney had joined in the prosecutor\u2019s pretrial request for the evaluation and also had raised a mental infirmity defense\u2014 extreme emotional disturbance\u2014at trial. Following the defendant\u2019s conviction, the Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed, and on further review, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed as well, rejecting the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim. The Court noted that where \u201ca defendant requests [a psychiatric] evaluation or presents psychiatric evidence ... at the very least, the prosecution may rebut this presentation with evidence from reports of the examination that the defendant requested.\u201d Buchanan, 483 U.S. at 422-23, 107 S.Ct. at 2917-18. The Court explained the distinction between the circumstances in Buchanan and those in Smith:\nThis case presents one of the situations that we distinguished from the facts in Smith. Here [the defendant\u2019s] counsel joined in a motion for [the competency psychiatrist\u2019s] examination pursuant to the Kentucky procedure for involuntary hospitalization. Moreover, [the defendant\u2019s] entire defense strategy was to establish the \u201cmental status\u201d defense of extreme emotional disturbance. Indeed, the sole \u25a0witness for [the defendant] was [the defendant\u2019s mental health expert], who was asked by defense counsel to do little more than read to the jury the psychological reports and letter in the custody of Kentucky\u2019s Department of Human Services. In such circumstances, with [the defendant] not taking the stand, the Commonwealth could not respond to this defense unless it presented other psychological evidence. Accordingly, the Commonwealth asked [the defense expert] to read excerpts of [the competency psychiatrist\u2019s] report, in which the psychiatrist had set forth his general observations about the mental state of [the defendant] but had not described any statements by [the defendant] dealing with the crimes for which he was charged. The introduction of such a report for this limited purpose does not constitute a Fifth Amendment violation.\nId. at 423-24, 107 S.Ct. at 2918 (emphases in original). The Court further concluded that the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not been violated, noting that the Sixth Amendment affords criminal defendants the opportunity to consult with counsel, which the defendant undoubtedly had. Recognizing that the effectiveness of such consultation requires that counsel be \u201cinformed about the scope and nature of the proceeding,\u201d the Court noted that the defendant\u2019s counsel unquestionably had such information, especially in light of Smith, which put counsel \u201con notice that if ... he intended to put on a \u2018mental status\u2019 defense for [the defendant], he would have to anticipate the use of psychological evidence by the prosecution in rebuttal.\u201d Id. at 425, 107 S.Ct. at 2919.\nThis Court followed Buchanan in Morley, 545 Pa. 420, 681 A.2d 1254, which is the cornerstone of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument in the instant case. In Morley, the defendant pleaded guilty to a general charge of criminal homicide and asserted a diminished capacity defense at the degree of guilt hearing. At the close of the defendant\u2019s case, defense counsel joined a motion by the prosecutor to permit the Commonwealth\u2019s psychiatric expert to examine the defendant prior to the expert\u2019s testifying as to the issue of specific intent. The trial court appointed the Commonwealth\u2019s expert to conduct the examination and, following the examination, the expert testified that the defendant was capable of forming the specific intent to kill. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, the defendant challenged the expert testimony as having violated her right against self-incrimination. The Superior Court affirmed, and on further appeal to this Court, we affirmed as well. Consistently with Buchanan, we held that \u201cwhere a defendant ... raises a mental-status defense, ... that defendant does not have a right to raise a Fifth Amendment challenge.\u201d Morley, 681 A.2d at 1257.\nHere, appellant\u2019s constitutional objections fail for several reasons. First and foremost, appellant\u2019s insistence that Dr. Weiner\u2019s penalty phase testimony violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights because of what occurred during the competency examination wholly ignores the fact that the record shows that the challenged testimony was not based upon the doctor\u2019s competency examination. Dr. Weiner testified, outside the presence of the jury prior to penalty phase testimony, that all opinions that he would offer would not draw upon any information gleaned in the course of his competency examination. N.T., 11/10/01, at 1074-75. Indeed, when the trial court inquired as to whether Dr. Weiner \u201cwould be able to address the two issues without discussing anything\u201d ascertained from the competency hearing, Dr. Weiner responded: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Id. at 1091. There was no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s crediting this assurance. Accordingly, the factual predicate for appellant\u2019s constitutional claims does not exist.\nFurthermore, even accepting appellant\u2019s contention that, contrary to the doctor\u2019s assurance, the testimony could have been based partially upon the competency evaluation, appellant\u2019s constitutional claims would nonetheless fail in light of Buchanan and Morley. As those cases make clear, appellant waived any Fifth Amendment objection to the introduction of the challenged testimony by virtue of his pursuit of both a mental-status defense at trial-ie., insanity\u2014and mental\u2014status mitigators during the penalty phase\u2014i.e., extreme mental or emotional disturbance and the inability to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform it to the law.\nSimilarly, appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim fails because appellant was represented by counsel at the time of Dr. Weiner\u2019s competency examination, and thus he was afforded the opportunity to consult with counsel prior to that examination and had an opportunity to raise any pertinent objection. Indeed, it was defense counsel who initiated the inquiry into competency when he requested a psychological evaluation in March of 2000. See Motion for Psychological Evaluation, 3/7/2000. The Commonwealth\u2019s subsequent motion to permit Dr. Weiner to examine appellant and to evaluate his competency, which was granted on June 30, 2000, was served on his then\u2014counsel. See Certif\u00edcate of Service, 6/28/00. Accordingly, notwithstanding appellant\u2019s present insistence to the contrary, counsel was on notice of the examination prior to its occurrence. Thus, similar to the scenario in Buchanan, appellant\u2019s competency stage counsel knew of the scope and nature of the challenged examination and its potential consequences\u2014i.e., that it might yield incriminating evidence which potentially would be admissible against appellant should he raise a mental infirmity defense at trial\u2014yet raised no objection. Thus, the Sixth Amendment claim fails.\nAppellant\u2019s second penalty phase claim is that the trial court abused its discretion by permitting excessive and cumulative victim impact evidence, thereby resulting in an unlawful sentence of death based upon passion, emotion, and prejudice, in violation of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3). Citing to a dissenting viewpoint in this Court\u2019s jurisprudence, appellant alleges generally that victim impact testimony amounts to \u201can impermissible \u2018arbitrary tiebreaker\u2019 and \u2018super aggravating factor,\u2019 ensuring that the jury would find in favor of death.\u201d Brief at 30 (quoting Commonwealth v. Means, 565 Pa. 309, 773 A.2d 143, 161 (2001) (Zappala, J., dissenting)). More specifically, appellant contends that the Commonwealth\u2019s introduction of the testimony of ten witnesses\u2014five concerning one victim; three concerning another; and two concerning the third\u2014was extensive and repetitive and prevented the jury from conducting a rational penalty phase inquiry.\nThe Commonwealth counters by noting that the Sentencing Code expressly permits the admission of victim impact testimony and that this Court has held that the admission of such testimony does not violate either the Pennsylvania or the United States Constitution. Furthermore, the Commonwealth notes the inevitability that \u201c[t]he more victims there are the more victim impact testimony there will be,\u201d and submits that there is no rule against the introduction of more than one impact witness per murder victim. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 42. Additionally,: the Commonwealth counters appellant\u2019s challenge to the extensiveness of its victim impact testimony by noting that appellant introduced the testimony of six witnesses during his penalty phase case-in-chief. Finally, the Commonwealth notes that the trial judge read the model instruction, proposed by this Court in Means, which advised the jury of how properly to consider victim impact testimony when considering aggravating and mitigating evidence.\nIn its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the trial court reasoned that \u201cthe number of victims in this case necessitated the large number of witnesses\u201d and that, because it read the Means instruction verbatim, there is no merit to appellant\u2019s challenge to the victim impact testimony. We see no error in the court\u2019s ruling.\nThe Pennsylvania Sentencing Code expressly sets forth that, during the penalty phase of a capital trial, \u201cevidence concerning the victim and the impact that the death of the victim has had on the family of the victim is admissible.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(a)(2). The Code further states, in relevant part, that:\nThe court shall instruct the jury that if it finds at least one aggravating circumstance and at least one mitigating circumstance, it shall consider, in weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, any evidence presented about the victim and about the impact of the murder on the victim\u2019s family.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(2).\nIn Means, the trial court found that Sections 9711(a)(2) and (c)(2) violated the defendant\u2019s rights under both the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. The Commonwealth appealed to this Court, and we reversed in an Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court (\u201cOAJC\u201d) authored by Mr. Justice (now Mr. Chief Justice) Cappy. The OAJC began by analyzing the precise nature of the rights involved, noting that although \u201c[t]he basic question concerns the Eighth Amendment and Article 1, Section 13 [of the Pennsylvania Constitution], ... the discrete inquiry at bar infuses elements of due process and equal protection into that broader question.\u201d Means, 773 A.2d at 149. Ultimately, the OAJC found that the statute permitting victim impact testimony did not violate the federal constitution, relying on Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 827, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 2609, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991) (\u201c[I]f the State chooses to permit the admission of victim impact evidence and prosecutorial argument on that subject, the Eighth Amendment erects no per se bar. A State may legitimately conclude that evidence about the victim and about the impact of the murder on the victim\u2019s family is relevant to the jury\u2019s decision as to whether or not the death penalty should be imposed.\u201d); and similarly, that it did not violate the Pennsylvania Constitution. Means, 773 A.2d at 157. Mr. Justice Saylor concurred in the result reached by the OAJC that the Sentencing Code provision permitting victim impact testimony is constitutional, thereby providing the fourth vote upholding the statute, but disagreed with the OAJC\u2019s constitutional analysis. See Means, 773 A.2d at 160. Moreover, in consideration of the concern raised by the trial court regarding the appropriate manner in which to charge a jury on such evidence, the OAJC articulated a suggested \u201cprototype jury instruction\u201d for victim impact testimony. Id. at 158-59.\nAlthough Means did not achieve a majority consensus as to why Section 9711(c)(2) is constitutional, a majority of this Court has since consistently rejected challenges, similar to the general claim raised herein, that the statute is unconstitutional. See Commonwealth v. Williams, 578 Pa. 504, 854 A.2d 440, 446 (2004); Commonwealth v. Harris, 572 Pa. 489, 817 A.2d 1033, 1052 (2002); Commonwealth v. Rice, 568 Pa. 182, 795 A.2d 340, 352 (2002). Indeed, in Williams, this Court rejected the argument, which is implicit in appellant\u2019s present position, that this Court should abandon Means and adopt a rule disallowing victim impact testimony on the strength of the dissenting opinion in Mea,ns and the concurring and dissenting opinion in Rice, where Justice Zappala employed the same analysis. Williams, 854 A.2d at 446. Similarly, in Hams we reaffirmed that the statute is constitutional, rejecting due process, equal protection, and cruel and unusual punishment challenges. Harris, 817 A.2d at 1053. Moreover, a majority of the Court made clear in Means that trial courts have substantial control over the manner in which victim impact testimony is presented to the jury. See Means, 773 A.2d at 158; id. at 160 (Saylor, J., concurring).\nHere, appellant\u2019s general allegation attacking victim impact testimony as a \u201csuper aggravator\u201d recites an argument that this Court has repeatedly rejected. Thus, his general attack on Section 9711(a)(2) must fail. As to appellant\u2019s more specific argument that the evidence in this case was so extensive and repetitive as to call the penalty verdicts into question, we note first that the text of Section 9711(a)(2) does not purport to set limits on the amount of allowable victim impact testimony. Furthermore, our decisional law has not purported to fashion a bright-line rule limiting the quantity of victim impact testimony or the number of victim impact witnesses who may testify at a capital sentencing hearing. On the contrary, it is within the sound discretion of the trial court to ascertain the appropriate nature and extent of victim impact evidence which ultimately is placed before a jury. See Williams, 854 A.2d at 447. As the Commonwealth aptly notes, where there are multiple victims in a given case, the amount of available and relevant victim impact testimony will likely be commensurately more extensive. Here, appellant does not argue with any specificity why it was that the sheer number of witnesses called, or the nature of their testimony, or the facts of this case prove an abuse of discretion. Instead, he relies primarily on the sheer number of witnesses and the dissent\u2019s general concerns in Means. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting the Commonwealth to introduce the challenged testimony, the nature of which was allowed by Section 9711(a)(2) and the extent of which was logically permitted by the circumstances of appellant\u2019s multiple crimes.\nAppellant\u2019s final contention is that the trial court\u2019s imposition of the death sentences in this case is in direct contravention of the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002), that the Eighth Amendment does not permit execution of the mentally retarded. Appellant did not anticipate the Atkins decision, and thus he did not raise or preserve an Atkins claim below. Appellant nevertheless argues that he adequately demonstrated his mental deficiencies throughout the course of the trial, based upon his showing that he satisfied certain criteria which are mentioned in the Atkins opinion as being generally indicative of mental retardation. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 32-33. The Commonwealth counters that, based upon the same criteria listed by appellant, the record shows that appellant is not mentally retarded, and that the holding in Atkins therefore does not apply to him.\nIn Atkins, the Supreme Court expressly overruled its prior holding in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989) (Eighth Amendment does not categorically prohibit execution of mentally retarded), and held as follows:\nOur independent evaluation of the issue reveals no reason to disagree with the judgment of \u201cthe legislatures that have recently addressed the matter\u201d and concluded that death is not a suitable punishment for a mentally retarded criminal. We are not persuaded that the execution of mentally retarded criminals will measurably advance the deterrent or the retributive purpose of the death penalty. Construing and applying the Eighth Amendment in the light of our \u201cevolving standards of decency,\u201d we therefore conclude that such punishment is excessive and that the Constitution \u201cplaces a\nas \"confusing and inadequate.\u201d The trial court dismissed that argument, noting that it had read verbatim the charge suggested by this Court in Means. Appellant does not pursue this argument on appeal, and therefore, we do not address it further. substantive restriction on the State\u2019s power to take the life\u201d of a mentally retarded offender.\n536 U.S. at 321, 122 S.Ct. at 2252 (citation omitted). The Court did not, however, explicitly adopt a standard national definition for mental retardation, leaving that point to be decided by the individual states.\nRecently, in Commonwealth v. Mitchell, 576 Pa. 258, 839 A.2d 202, 210 (2003), this Court reviewed an Atkins claim raised under circumstances where, as here, the defendant was tried and convicted prior to the Atkins decision, raised no Aifcms-type claim below, then filed his direct appellate brief with this Court after the Atkins decision and sought its immediate benefit. In Mitchell, we noted that both the defendant and the Commonwealth attempted to \u201cmuster persuasive arguments by taking [mental health expert] testimony out of the context in which it was presented and rereading it with the hindsight benefit of the holding of Atkins.\u201d Mitchell, 839 A.2d at 210. Ultimately, this Court decided not to review the Atkins claim and not to remand it for a direct appeal evidentiary hearing, explaining as follows:\nThe issue of mental retardation was touched upon in passing, but it was not the focal point of the testimony of the [mental health expert], nor was it the central focus of either direct or cross-examination. It would be injudicious to reach a legal conclusion on the question of mental retardation based on the current record. To prejudge the merits of [the defendant\u2019s] Atkins claim based on the limited evidence currently available may create future problems for [the defendant] in raising this issue in the correct forum, as he may then be faced with a determination that the issue was previously litigated.\nNor do we believe that a remand for an evidentiary hearing at this juncture[ ] is the best possible solution for exploring this claim. The claim [the defendant] cannot be executed because after the sentence of death was imposed a constructional ban on the execution of mentally retarded capital defendants was formulated is a claim challenging the authority of the state to carry out the sentence. Direct review from the judgment of a sentence of death is normally directed at the validity of the legal decisions supporting the conviction or the propriety of the process through with the sentence was achieved. Moreover, this claim will not be lost if review is postponed. If [the defendant] is mentally retarded the judgment of sentence cannot be carried out. Thus, considering the current state of the record and the importance of the claim itself, we find that this claim is best suited to full review in the collateral stage.\nMitchell, 839 A.2d at 210-11 (citation omitted).\nMitchell is controlling here. As in Mitchell, appellant\u2019s counsel has diligently attempted to fashion a persuasive Atkins argument by taking mental health testimony out of the non-Atkins context in which it was presented. But the record was not developed in such a way as to make out an Atkins claim. Moreover, the parties\u2019 arguments are similarly deficient, as both are focused solely on the issue of whether appellant satisfied the \u201cdefinition\u201d of mental retardation, apparently proceeding upon the assumption that the criterion plucked from the definitions cited in the Atkins opinion are controlling as to that question. That presumption is erroneous, as the Atkins Court did not purport to adopt any standard, but rather, as we noted in Mitchell, left to the states the task of implementing the restriction banning the execution of the mentally retarded. See Mitchell, 839 A.2d at 209.\nAs was the case in Mitchell, it would be injudicious at this juncture for this Court to pass upon the claim, and the more appropriate avenue for review of the claim is upon collateral attack if appellant so desires. Accordingly, this claim is dismissed without prejudice to appellant\u2019s right to raise and pursue it upon collateral review under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9541, et seq. See Mitchell, 839 A.2d at 211.\nIV. Statutory Review\nFinally, pursuant to our Sentencing Code, this Court is required to conduct a statutory review of the death sentences and must affirm those sentence unless we determine that:\n(i) the sentence of death was the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor; or (ii) the evidence fails to support the findings of at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d).\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3). The jury unanimously found one statutory aggravating circumstance as to each murder conviction\u2014ie., that appellant was convicted of another murder committed before or at the time of the murder at issue, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(ll). See Jury Verdict Slip. The evidence amply demonstrated that appellant committed three murders, and he was convicted for each; thus, the evidence clearly was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of that aggravator as to each murder. Furthermore, our independent review of the record demonstrates that the jury\u2019s sentence of death, which followed upon a consideration of appellant\u2019s multiple proffered mitigating circumstances, and then a weighing of the aggravators and mitigators actually found, was not the product of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, but rather, resulted from the proper discharge of its sentencing function.\nAccordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions and sentences of death and dismiss appellant\u2019s claim of death penalty ineligibility based upon mental retardation without prejudice to appellant\u2019s right to raise that claim on collateral review under the PCRA.\nChief Justice CAPPY files a concurring opinion in which Messrs. Justice NIGRO and SAYLOR join.\n. The order also directed that Mayview Hospital submit to the court, every 30 days, a written report \"outlining [appellant\u2019s] treatment and evaluating his competency to understand and participate in the legal proceedings.\u201d Order of Court, 4/25/00.\n. Although the Commonwealth asserts that appellant was adjudicated competent to stand trial on July 28, 2000, the trial court\u2019s order did not include any competency finding. In any event, there is no dispute as to appellant\u2019s ultimate competence to stand trial. See N.T., 5/21/01, at 11.\n. Appellant was also convicted of the following crimes: eight counts of aggravated assault, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702; one count of arson, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3301(a)(1); one count each of causing a catastrophe and risking a catastrophe, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3302(a) and (b); one count of ethnic intimidation, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2710; one count of violating the Uniform Firearms Act, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6106; four counts of terroristic threats, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2706; three counts of unlawful restraint, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2902; four counts of simple assault, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2701; and sixteen counts of recklessly endangering another person, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2705.\n. The aggravating circumstance found by the jury was that appellant was convicted of another murder that was committed before or at the time of the murder in question. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711 (d)(ll). The mitigating circumstance found by the jury was the \"catchall\u201d mitigator. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8) (\"Any other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.\u201d).\n. The bullet passed through Kroll\u2019s right lung and lodged in his back. The wound bled profusely, causing blood to collect in Kroll's pleural cavity and sending him into a state of shock, which resulted in his death.\n. The gunshot wound that killed Healy revealed that the tip of appellant's gun was either in contact or nearly in contact with the right side of Healy's head, behind his right ear. The bullet went into Healy\u2019s brain and transected his brain stem, resulting in his death.\n. Mr. Clinger is now paralyzed on the right side of his body. Mr. Bostard suffered a shattered jaw, a severed vocal cord, and a permanent loss of hearing; and the bullet that struck him remains lodged in the back of his neck.\n. The bullet passed through Sanielevici\u2019s right cerebral hemisphere and lodged in the back of his head.\n. Furthermore, the Walzack Court expressly noted at the outset that its holding was not to be read as \"inferentially accepting the irresistible impulse test which [the Court had] previously rejected.\u201d Walzack, 360 A.2d at 916 (citing Commonwealth v. Myers, 444 Pa. 465, 282 A.2d 347, 350 (1971)).\n. No member of the jury found the existence of either of these mental-status mitigators. See Jury Verdict Slip.\n. Our decision in Freeman announced the abrogation of this Court\u2019s direct capital appeal \"relaxed waiver\" doctrine, holding that \"as a general rule on capital direct appeals, claims that were not properly raised and preserved in the trial court are waived and unreviewable.\u201d Id. at 402. We further held that the new rule would be applied \"prospectively, beginning with those capital direct appeals in which the appellant\u2019s brief has not yet been filed in this Court, and is not due for thirty days or more after today\u2019s decision.\u201d Id. at 403. Because Freeman was filed on May 30, 2003, and appellants brief in the instant case was not filed until August 14, 2003, appellant is not entitled to application of the former relaxed waiver rule.\n. See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\n. Notably, although appellant alleges the violation of his Pennsylvania constitutional rights in his question presented on appeal, he forwards no argument detailing the nature of his state rights, how they were violated, or whether he believes that they differ from his federal constitutional rights. Accordingly, we will deem the rights involved to be coterminous.\n. This Court also rejected Morley's argument that Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution afforded her a broader right against self-incrimination than the Fifth Amendment. Morley, 681 A.2d at 1258.\n. We are aware that the Buchanan Court highlighted that the evidence at issue there did not contain any incriminating statements made by the defendant, but solely reflected the competency psychiatrist\u2019s opinion. Buchanan, 483 U.S. at 423-24, 107 S.Ct. at 2918. Notably, this Court\u2019s later holding in Morley does not cite that factor as essential to the inquiry of whether testimony gleaned from a pre-trial competency examination is constitutionally permissible. See Morley, 681 A.2d at 1257. In any event, there is no claim here that Dr. Weiner divulged incriminating statements made by appellant.\n. Appellant asserts that \"no one bothered to tell [appellant] or his attorneys about the competency examination at all,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 22, but points to no evidence supporting that bald allegation, an allegation which is contradicted by the record.\n. Justice Zappala dissented, joined by Chief Justice Flaherty, and Justice Nigro dissented as well. Means, 773 A.2d at 160, 162.\n. In his Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal, appellant also challenged the trial court's jury instruction on victim impact testimony\n. Appellant categorizes his alleged cognitive and functional limitations according to those criteria listed in the definitions espoused by both the American Association of Mental Retardation (AAMR) and the American Psychiatric Association (APA). See Atkins, 536 U.S. at 309 n. 3, 122 S.Ct at 2245 n. 3.\n. The Prothonotary of this Court is directed to transmit a complete record of this case to the Governor of Pennsylvania, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(i)."}
