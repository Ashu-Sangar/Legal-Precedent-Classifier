{"id": "896102", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn the court below this case was heard on the demurrer to appellant\u2019s petition for a bill of review of the accounts specified therein. The demurrer was sustained and the petition dismissed at the petitioner\u2019s costs, and hence this appeal.\nA careful consideration of the record has satisfied us that no other decree should have been made, and that neither of the questions involved requires further discussion.\nFor reasons given in the opinion of the learned judge of the orphans\u2019 court, the decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
