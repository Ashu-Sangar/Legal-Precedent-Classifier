{"id": "4194522", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nA Department of Public Welfare (DPW) field representative visited St. Elizabeth\u2019s Child Care Center, a nonprofit child daycare center affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church. The field representative did not observe any health or safety hazards at the center; however, she determined it did not have a certificate of compliance. DPW regulations require all child day care centers providing care for seven or more children, like St. Elizabeth\u2019s, to obtain a certificate of compliance before commencing operations. 55 Pa.Code \u00a7 3270.3(c); id., \u00a7 3270.11(a). Because St. Elizabeth\u2019s did not have a certificate, DPW ordered it to cease and desist operating the day care center. St. Elizabeth\u2019s appealed to DPW\u2019s Bureau of Hearings and Appeals, arguing DPW lacked statutory authority to promulgate regulations requiring certification of nonprofit child day care centers. St. Elizabeth\u2019s also raised constitutional concerns regarding the regulations\u2019 impact on religious liberty.\nAn administrative law judge (ALJ) explained Article IX of the Public Welfare Code, 62 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 901-922, grants DPW supervision over \u201call children\u2019s institutions within this Commonwealth,\u201d including nonprofit child day care centers like St. Elizabeth\u2019s. Id., \u00a7 902(3). This supervisory power has been construed broadly. See Hospital Association of Pennsylvania v. MacLeod, 487 Pa. 516, 410 A.2d 731, 734-35 (1980) (holding \u00a7 902 authorized Department of Health to regulate hospitals\u2019 managerial practices). Further, the ALJ determined \u00a7 911\u2019s primary purpose was to approve operations. ALJ Opinion, 7/25/05, at 15 (noting \u00a7 911(a)(1) authorizes inspection before operations commence). Therefore, the ALJ held DPW may require nonprofit child day care centers to obtain a certificate of compliance. Id., at 18. Because of statutory constraints, the ALJ could not rule on the regulations\u2019 constitutionality. See 1 Pa.Code \u00a7 35.187 (enumerating ALJ\u2019s authority). The ALJ recommended St. Elizabeth\u2019s appeal be denied, and the Bureau of Hearings and Appeals adopted this recommendation.\nThe Commonwealth Court reversed, distinguishing Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, concluding it did not address any regulation under Article IX. St. Elizabeth\u2019s Child Care Ctr. v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 895 A.2d 1280, 1282-83 (Pa.Cmwlth.2006) (citing Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, at 735 n. 11). Moreover, the court noted Article X authorizes DPW to promulgate regulations regarding licensing of for-profit child day care centers, see 62 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1002, 1021, whereas Article IX is silent on the issue of certification, see 62 P.S. \u00a7 911. St. Elizabeth\u2019s Child Care Ctr., at 1282. Applying the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, the court concluded DPW did not have authority under Article IX to require St. Elizabeth\u2019s be certified before operating its day care center. Id. The court did not discuss St. Elizabeth\u2019s religious liberty argument. Id., at 1283 n. 8.\nJudge Pellegrini concurred with the majority\u2019s analysis of Article IX, but would have reversed on different grounds, namely, that DPW did not have jurisdiction to enforce the cease and desist order. Id., at 1283 (Pellegrini, J., concurring). He cited \u00a7 911, noting DPW is limited to visiting and inspecting nonprofit centers, inquiring into matters related to their operations, and directing institutions to correct any objectionable conditions. Id., at 1283-84. He further argued \u00a7 911 does not give authority to issue cease and desist orders, but only permits DPW to request the Department of Justice institute legal proceedings. Id., at 1284 (citing 62 P.S. \u00a7 911(c)).\nJudge Cohn Jubelirer joined Judge Pellegrini\u2019s concurrence, and dissented without opinion. Judge Smith-Ribner dissented without opinion.\nWe granted allowance of appeal on the following issues: Whether [the] Commonwealth Court erred when it invalidated a [DPW] regulation requiring nonprofit day care facilities, in order to lawfully operate, to hold a certificate of compliance from DPW verifying compliance with health and safety regulations?\nWhether [the] Commonwealth Court, in so invalidating the DPW regulation, erred in applying the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius to the absolute exclusion of other canons of statutory construction that are more relevant here?\nPetition for Allowance of Appeal, at 3.\nAs this case concerns Article IX\u2019s meaning, it is a case of statutory interpretation and is a pure question of law. See Commonwealth v. Bortz, 589 Pa. 431, 909 A.2d 1221, 1223 (2006). Questions of law are subject to a de novo standard of review, and the scope of review is plenary. Craley v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, 586 Pa. 484, 895 A.2d 530, 539 n. 14 (2006).\nDPW argues Article IX confers broad regulatory power on DPW, providing it with supervisory authority over \u201call children\u2019s institutions within this Commonwealth.\u201d 62 P.S. \u00a7 902(3). DPW contends the language authorizing the supervision of child day care facilities is more explicit than the language Hospital Association of Pennsylvania relied on to uphold extensive regulations under Article IX. See Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, at 734-35 (holding Article IX gives Department of Health power to establish rules and regulations although Article IX lacks express grant of authority). Finally, DPW questions the Commonwealth Court\u2019s exclusive reliance on the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius, maintaining the court should have considered competing canons of statutory construction. DPW\u2019s Brief, at 14.\nSt. Elizabeth\u2019s argues Article IX only permits DPW supervision of nonprofit, religious child care providers and does not authorize licensing. St. Elizabeth\u2019s Brief, at 16. Because administrative agencies may only exercise regulatory authority conferred on them expressly or by implication, St. Elizabeth\u2019s contends DPW lacks authority to require it have a certificate of compliance. See Commonwealth v. Butler County Mushroom Farm, 499 Pa. 509, 454 A.2d 1, 4 (1982). St. Elizabeth\u2019s notes DPW regulations relating to the social development of children may conflict with Catholic teaching. See, e.g., 55 Pa.Code \u00a7 3270.1. Therefore, St. Elizabeth\u2019s maintains DPW\u2019s regulatory scheme violates the federal Constitution\u2019s First Amendment and Article I, \u00a7 3 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n\u201cThe purpose of the interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d Chanceford Aviation Properties, LLP v. Chanceford Twp. Bd. of Supervisors, 592 Pa. 100, 923 A.2d 1099, 1104 (2007) (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a)). \u201cWords and phrases [of a statute] shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.... \u201d 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1903(a). \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, they are presumed to be the best indication of legislative intent.\u201d Hannaberry HVAC v. WCAB (Snyder, Jr.), 575 Pa. 66, 834 A.2d 524, 531 (2003) (citation omitted). \u201cIt is only when the statute\u2019s words are not explicit that the legislature\u2019s intent may be ascertained by considering the factors provided in 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c).\u201d Chanceford, at 1104.\nArticle IX provides DPW \u201cshall have supervision over ... all children\u2019s institutions within this Commonwealth.\u201d 62 P.S. \u00a7 902(3). A children\u2019s institution is defined as \u201cany incorporated or unincorporated organization, society, corporation or agency, public or private, which may receive or care for children....\u201d Id., \u00a7 901. St. Elizabeth\u2019s, as a private child day care provider, qualifies as a children\u2019s institution subject to DPW\u2019s supervisory power. Article IX further states:\n(a) The department shall have the power, and its duty shall be:\n(1) To make and enforce rules and regulations for a visitation, examination and inspection of all supervised institutions and said visitation, examination or inspection may occur both before and after the beginning of operation of the supervised facility.\n(2) To visit and inspect, at least once in each year, all state and supervised institutions; to inquire and examine into their methods of instruction, discipline, detention, care or treatment, ... the official conduct of their inspectors, trustees, managers, directors or other officer or officers!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 the buildings, grounds, premises, and equipment!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 and all and every matter and thing relating to their usefulness, administration, and management, and to the welfare of the inmates thereof....\n(c) Whenever upon the visitation, examination, and inspection of any State or supervised institution, any condition is found to exist therein which, in the opinion of the department, is unlawful, unhygienic, or detrimental to the proper maintenance and discipline of such State or supervised institution ...[,] [the department has power] to direct the officer or officers ... to correct the said objectionable condition in the manner and within the time specified by the department....\nId., \u00a7 911.\nArticle IX neither explicitly forbids nor requires DPW to issue regulations mandating that supervised institutions have a certificate of compliance. However, \u201c[o]ur review of the code must recognize that \u2018[substantive rule-making is a widely used administrative practice, and its use should be upheld whenever the statutory delegation can reasonably be construed to authorize it.\u2019 \u201d Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, at 733 (quoting Bernard Schwartz, Administrative Law \u00a7 56 at 151 (1976)). \u201cThe interpretation of a statute by those charged with its execution is entitled to great deference, and will not be overturned unless such construction is clearly erroneous.\u201d Caso v. Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeal Bd., 576 Pa. 287, 839 A.2d 219, 221 (2003); see also 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(8).\nDPW\u2019s interpretation of its enabling statute is not clearly erroneous. Section 911 expressly requires DPW inquire into and examine supervised institutions\u2019 \u201cmethods of instruction, discipline, ... care or treatment, ... the official conduct of their ... managers, directors or other ... officers!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 the buildings, grounds ... and equipment!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 and all ... matter ... relating to their ... administration, and management, and to the welfare of the inmates thereof.\u201d 62 P.S. \u00a7 911(a)(2). It is reasonable to infer Article IX permits DPW to certify supervised institutions have passed the inspection process DPW is required to perform.\nMoreover, Article IX has been interpreted as granting broad supervisory powers to DPW. Although \u00a7 911 only specifically authorizes regulations related to visitation, examination, and inspection, Hospital Association of Pennsylvania relied on \u00a7 911 to uphold over 500 regulations of private hospitals on issues including patient dealings with administrators, orientation programs, inventory, and the taking and filing of minutes at meetings. See Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, at 734; 738-40. The regulations were so pervasive as to lead one Justice to declare them \u201ca manifesto for ... a socialization of private hospitals!\u201d Id., at 737 (Flaherty, J., dissenting). In spite of his warning, this Court found Article IX\u2019s grant of supervisory power includes the power to make substantive rules regulating supervised institutions beyond mere procedure. Id., at 734-35.\nWe further note DPW regulations requiring nonprofit and for-profit child care centers receive a certificate of compliance have been in effect in some form since 1978. See, e.g., 55 Pa.Code \u00a7 20.4 (effective 1985); \u201cCommonwealth of Pennsylvania Social Services Manual,\u201d Chapter 2, \u00a7 8A(59), at Original Record, Ex. A-16, at 9 (effective 1978). The legislature has not disturbed the regulations at issue here. This lack of activity over a 30-year period suggests DPW\u2019s regulations are not inconsistent with the legislature\u2019s intent. See Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, at 734 n. 10 (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(8) (considering legislative and administrative interpretations of statute)).\nIn striking down the certificate of compliance requirement, the Commonwealth Court relied on the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius. St. Elizabeth\u2019s Child Care Ctr., at 1282. However, when interpreting a statute, courts are required to follow the Rules of Statutory Construction. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1901 et seq. By relying exclusively on expressio unius, the Commonwealth Court failed to consider the weight accorded to administrative interpretation of the statute, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(8), the consequences of a particular interpretation, id., \u00a7 1921(c)(6), or that the legislature had not disturbed the administrative interpretation of the statute. Hospital Association of Pennsylvania, at 734 n. 10 (citing \u00a7 1921(c)(8)).\nThis failure to consider other means of construction is problematic in light of this Court\u2019s treatment of expressio unius. See Consumers Education and Protective Association v. Nolan, 470 Pa. 372, 368 A.2d 675, 684 (1977) (warning automatic application of maxim may thwart legislative intent). Other courts and commentators have also recognized limits on the maxim. See, e.g., Mourning v. Family Publications Service, Inc., 411 U.S. 356, 372, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973) (not reasonable to interpret acts delegating agency powers as including specific consideration of every evil to be corrected); Texas Rural Legal Aid v. Legal Services Corporation, 940 F.2d 685, 694 (D.C.Cir.1991) (\u201cthis canon [expressio unius] has little force in the administrative setting\u201d); Cass Sunstein, Interpreting Statutes in the Regulatory State, 103 Harv. L.Rev. 405, 455-56 (1989) (warning against mechanical application of expressio unius).\nAccordingly, we hold the Commonwealth Court erred when it invalidated DPW\u2019s regulations requiring St. Elizabeth\u2019s hold a certificate of compliance from DPW verifying its compliance with health and safety regulations. Further, we conclude the Commonwealth Court erred in applying expressio unius est exclusio alterius to invalidate the DPW regulations, while not referring to other canons of statutory construction. We reverse the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order and remand to the Commonwealth Court for consideration of St. Elizabeth\u2019s religious liberty claim.\nOrder reversed; case remanded.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices TODD and GREENSPAN join the opinion.\nJustice BAER files a concurring opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion in which Justice McCAFFERY joins.\n. The express mention of one thing excludes all others.\n. The Commonwealth Court did not specify in its conclusion which DPW regulations it was invalidating. See St. Elizabeth\u2019s Child Care Ctr., at 1283. As indicated above, DPW regulations require all child day care centers providing care for seven or more children, like St. Elizabeth\u2019s, obtain a certificate of compliance before commencing operations. 55 Pa.Code \u00a7 3270.3(c); id., \u00a7 3270.11(a)."}
