{"id": "1732179", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM:\nThe petition for allocatur is granted, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed, and the award of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board reinstated.\nOn March 5, 1974 petitioner James C. Dunmyre filed a petition to modify his workmen\u2019s compensation award from 50% disability to total permanent disability. The workmen\u2019s compensation referee granted the requested award and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board affirmed. The Commonwealth Court reversed, holding that there was insufficient evidence of increased disability to support the modification.\nThe evidence of Dunmyre\u2019s increased disability included Dunmyre\u2019s own testimony that he suffered from increased pain and loss of mobility. His doctor testified that Dunmyre\u2019s current physical condition was related to the accident for which he was claiming compensation, and that Dunmyre may have developed pseudoarthrosis since the time of the last award. On cross-examination by respondents\u2019 attorney, the doctor testified that Dunmyre\u2019s condition was not the same as previously.\nWe must take as true this evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom. E. g., Sierzega v. U. S. Steel Corp., 204 Pa.Super. 531, 205 A.2d 696 (1964). We therefore conclude that there was substantial evidence in the record to support this award.\nThe Commonwealth Court erred in concluding that Dunmyre had not made out a case of increased disability because his doctor testified that he believed Dunmyre had been completely disabled at the time of the previous award. See Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board v. Gimbel Bros., 19 Pa.Cmwlth. 176, 338 A.2d 755 (1975); Redwood Enterprises v. Darabant, 7 Pa.Cmwlth. 421, 298 A.2d 675 (1973). To require the workmen\u2019s compensation referee to accept this part of the doctor\u2019s testimony would undermine the referee\u2019s power as factfinder to determine credibility and to accept or reject any portion of the testimony of any witness. See, e. g., Moore v. McArthur Pile Corp., 193 Pa.Super. 512, 165 A.2d 275 (1960).\nOrder of Commonwealth Court reversed and the award of Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board reinstated.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204 (Supp. 1977).\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, \u00a7 413, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7 772 (1952 & Supp. 1977)."}
