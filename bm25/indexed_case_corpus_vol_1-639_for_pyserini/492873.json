{"id": "492873", "contents": "The judgment of the Supreme Court'was entered\nPer Curiam.\nWe consider this case as authoritatively ruled by the judgment of this court in Black v. Tricker, 9 P. F. Smith 13. It was held in that case that under the Act of May 5th 1855, it is not necessary that there should be a decree that a wife is to be regarded as a feme sole trader to enable her to hold property under the circumstances mentioned in the act. The decree was provided for in order that creditors, purchasers and others may, with certainty and safety, transact business with a married woman. There was ample evidence-of desertion by the husband to justify the submission of the case to the jury.\nJudgment affirmed."}
