{"id": "1165862", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nOn June 4, 1934, plaintiff entered against defendant, judgment in the sum of $1,387,807.30 on a bond secured by mortgage. At the sheriff\u2019s sale, which followed in due course on July 2, 1934, of the real estate subject to the judgment, the property was sold to plaintiff for the sum of $75. On December 31, 1934, plaintiff filed a petition to fix the fair value of the property in accordance with the Act of J anuary 17,1934, P. L. 243, and on that same date presented said petition to the court. The court fixed the time of hearing as J anuary 28, 1935. A copy of the petition was served upon defendant the day it was presented to the court, namely, December 31, 1934. Defendant filed a petition to strike off plaintiff\u2019s petition, on the ground that plaintiff had not given to defendant \u201cat least ten days\u2019 notice of the presentation of such petition,\u201d in accordance with section 1 of the Act of 1934. After the case reached the court below on that petition, the learned judge said: \u201cThe question arises what is meant by the provision of the act that \u2018at least ten days\u2019 notice, of the presentation of such petition shall be given to the defendant\u2019? It is theoretically possible to ascribe to it one of three meanings, namely, that it was meant to require that ten days\u2019 notice be given to the defendant before plaintiff presents the petition to the court for the fixing of a hearing, or that at least ten days\u2019 notice should be given to the defendant after the petition has been thus presented (the notice being of the fact of such presentation), or that at least ten days\u2019 notice should be given to the defendant prior to the hearing on the petition. It is not necessary to discuss the second of these suggested possibilities, because it is hardly reasonable to suppose that the phrase at least ten days\u2019 notice could apply to notice given after presentation of petition. The phrase \u2018at least\u2019 must refer to a notice of a future event and not to a past happening; what would it mean to say that \u2018at least ten days\u2019 notice\u2019 must be given of a past event. At any rate, if notice of the presentation had to be given at any time after such presentation, such notice was given to the defendant in the present case.\u201d The judge then aptly said: \u201cThe real question seems to be whether the ten days\u2019 notice is to be in advance of the presentation of the petition or of the hearing thereon. While it might seem more reasonable to suppose that the legislature intended the notice to be given of the hearing, nevertheless the fact cannot be disregarded that the word actually used is \u2018presentation.\u2019 \u201d The court then concluded that the provision under interpretation meant that \u201cwhen a party files a petition to determine the fair value he must give ten days\u2019 notice to the other party that the petition will be presented to the court for the purpose of having the time of a hearing thereon fixed.\u201d The court said that \u201cthe purpose of such notice is revealed in the last paragraph of section 1, which is to the effect that \u2018any party may, during the period of notice required by this act, demand a jury trial.\u2019 . . . When the petition is filed and at least ten days\u2019 notice is given to the other side that it will be presented to the court for the fixing of a hearing, the other party may, during that minimum ten days\u2019 period, demand a jury trial, in which case the court loses the power to proceed to a hearing on the petition.\u201d The court decided that plaintiff did not give to defendant the notice required by the act, but said further that \u201cthe only object of requiring the ten days\u2019 notice is to enable the other party to demand a jury trial. By the failure of the plaintiff in the present case to give such notice the defendant was not in any way harmed, unless it be that it intended to ask for a jury trial prior to the time for fixing a hearing. ... A fair and equitable construetion of the act would seem to be that if the required ten days\u2019 notice be not given prior to the presentation of the petition, the other party should not thereby be deprived of his right to demand a jury trial, but should continue \u2022to have that right for a period of ten days after notice is actually given to him of the fact that the petition was presented.\u201d The court\u2019s decision was that while plaintiff did not give the notice required under the terms of the act, nevertheless plaintiff should not be penalized for such failure by having its petition to fix the fair value stricken from the record. Defendant\u2019s petition to strike off plaintiff\u2019s petition was dismissed, without prejudice to defendant\u2019s right to demand a jury trial.\nWhile we affirm the judgment of the court below, we do not adopt the rationale of its opinion.. We hold that the notice given by plaintiff to defendant was a compliance with the terms of the act. When the governor approved the act now under review, he characterized it as a bill containing \u201ca few hastily and poorly constructed paragraphs.\u201d An examination of this act fully justifies the chief executive\u2019s characterization of it. There is no doubt that the troublesome sentence in section 1 is ambiguous. Recourse must therefore be had to established principles of interpretation.\nThe principle is well recognized in interpreting statutes that \u201cit often happens that the true intention of the law-making body, though obvious, is not expressed by the language employed in a statute when that language is given its literal meaning. In such cases, the carrying out of the legislative intention, which, as we have seen, is the prime and sole object of all rules of construction, can be accomplished only by departure from the literal interpretation of the language employed. Hence, the courts are not always confined to the literal meaning of a statute: the real purpose and intent of the legislature will prevail over the literal import of the words\u201d: 25 R. C. L., page 967, section 222. Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes, page 35, section 27, says: \u201cThe literal construction then, has in general, hut a prima facie preference. To arrive at the real meaning, it is always necessary to take a broad general view of the act, so as to get an exact conception of its aim, scope and object. . . . The true meaning is to be found, not merely from the words of the act, but from the cause and necessity of its being made, from a comparison of its several parts and from extraneous circumstances; or by an examination of, and comparison of the doubtful words with, the context of the law, considering its reason and spirit, and the inducing cause of its enactment.\u201d (Italics supplied.)\nThe true meaning of the sentence in section 1 that \u201cat least ten days\u2019 notice of the presentation of such petition shall be given to the defendant or defendants and to all parties whose interest appears on the record,\u201d becomes obvious when we read the last sentence of the section, as follows: \u201cIn either case, whether the petition is presented by the plaintiff or use-plaintiff, or by the defendant or other party in interest, any party may, during the period of notice required by this act, demand a jury trial, whereupon the fair value of the property shall be determined and fixed by a jury trial as in other cases.\u201d This sentence makes it clear that the \u201cten days\u2019 notice\u201d provided for earlier in the section must be a specific notice of the fact that a petition has been presented and this notice starts the running of a ten-day period during which the party notified must demand a jury trial if he wants it. In the administration of justice, notices of acts done are never mere empty gestures or meaningless recitals of past events. Such notices always serve the purpose of giving adverse parties an opportunity to take such action as they deem appropriate to the protection of their interests. It would be unreasonable to interpret this section as meaning that a plaintiff who intends to present a petition must give ten days notice of that intention before carrying it out. No purpose would be served by such notice, and notices without legal purpose are never required. For example, under the Practice Act any person can file a plaintiff\u2019s statement without giving-notice of his intention to do so, but when he does file it, he must, in order to require the defendant either to answer it or suffer judgment to be taken against him, give him fifteen days\u2019 notice of the fact that the statement has been filed, the purpose being, of course, to afford the opposing party ample time to take protective action. Likewise, in divorce cases, the libellant presents his petition or libel and secures a subpoena which directs the 'party complained against to appear. There is no provision for a notice of the fact that the libel is to be filed.\nIn the instant case, the phrase, \u201cat least ten days\u2019 notice of the presentation of such petition,\u201d does not mean that ten days\u2019 notice must be given of a future presentation of a petition; it obviously means ten days\u2019 notice of a past presentation to the court out of which the writ issued, of a petition to fix, after a hearing, the fair value of the property sold, the ten days being merely the measure of the period during which the party notified must exercise his right to demand a jury trial or suffer the value of the property to be fixed by a judge, sitting without a jury, or, by a judge after a master has preliminarily determined it upon due hearing before him.\nAn interpretation that a defendant and all other parties in interest are, under the statute, entitled to ten days\u2019 notice before a petition is presented to fix the fair value of the property, is so completely out of harmony with the tenor and purport of the act as to be rejected by reason. The clearly expressed purpose to be served by the notice makes clear what is obscure in its statutory description.\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed."}
