{"id": "4195690", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nOn January 26, 2001, appellant and Curtis Haith fought\u2014 appellant sustained a black eye and split lip. Appellant solicited Joseph Stenger and two other unidentified men to retaliate. The four made a stop to retrieve weapons (a baseball bat and a crow bar), then drove to Haith\u2019s home. While the two unidentified men hid near the door, appellant lured Haith outside; the two men beat him with the weapons, while appellant repeatedly kicked him and bit his right hand. Stenger got out of the vehicle and shot Haith in the face; the bullet entered his left cheek, exited near his mouth, and produced only superficial wounds. Haith died the following day from the head trauma sustained during the attack.\nPolice interviewed appellant later that day, at which time she handed over the mud and blood-splattered clothing she was wearing during the attack. Appellant was not arrested until 2004, after she confessed to her ex-boyfriend that she participated in the attack on Haith. Forensic evidence indicated the mud on appellant\u2019s clothing was consistent with soil samples from the crime scene, and her dental molds matched the bite mark on Haith\u2019s hand.\nAppellant was charged with criminal homicide and conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, plus assault charges. A jury found appellant guilty of third degree murder and conspiracy to commit criminal homicide. Notably, the criminal homicide verdict slip provided the option of finding appellant guilty of first degree murder, third degree murder, voluntary manslaughter, or not guilty; the jury indicated third degree murder. The conspiracy verdict slip read \u201cCriminal Conspiracy-Criminal Homicide,\u201d and the jury wrote the word \u201cGuilty\u201d below the charge, which provided no gradation options.\nAt sentencing, the trial court improperly referred to appellant\u2019s conspiracy conviction as \u201ccriminal conspiracy to commit murder in the third degree.\u201d N.T. Sentencing Hearing, 4/19/06, at 4. The original sentencing orders perpetuated the error; listed at improper docket numbers, these orders identified the convictions as \u201cCriminal Homicide Murder 3rd Degree (F-l),\u201d and \u201cCriminal Conspiracy Murder 3rd Degree (F-l).\u201d Sentencing Orders at No. 1496 of 2004, 4/18/06, & No. 1496-1/4 of 2004, 4/19/06. The sentencing orders were amended to reflect the correct docket numbers, but both amended orders still identified the charge as \u201cCriminal Conspiracy Murder 3rd Degree (F-l).\u201d Amended Sentencing Orders at Nos. 498 & 498-1/4 of 2004, 4/19/06. Both the original and amended orders set forth the same sentence: 12 and one-half to 25 years imprisonment for the murder conviction, and a consecutive two and one-half to five years imprisonment for the conspiracy conviction.\nThe trial court denied appellant\u2019s timely motion to modify sentence, in which she argued her third degree murder and conspiracy to commit criminal homicide charges merged for sentencing purposes. Appellant filed a direct appeal, raising several claims, including whether the conspiracy count was based on insufficient evidence. The trial court held the evidence was sufficient to support the conspiracy verdict; thus, it deemed meritless her argument regarding the validity of the criminal conspiracy to commit homicide verdict. The Superior Court affirmed.\nThis Court granted allowance of appeal, limited to the issue of \u201c[w]hether it is possible, as a matter of law, to be convicted of conspiracy to commit murder in the third degree?\u201d Commonwealth v. Weimer, 594 Pa. 32, 934 A.2d 1148 (2007) (Table). \u201cAs this is a purely legal question, our standard of review is de novo,\u201d and our scope of review is plenary. In re Milton Hershey School, 590 Pa. 35, 911 A.2d 1258, 1261 (2006) (citation omitted). Appellant argues:\nIt is not possible under the law to commit the crime of conspiracy to commit murder in the third degree. The essence of third degree murder is a homicide that occurs as the unintended consequence of a malicious act. It is impossible for one to intend to commit an unintentional act.\nAppellant\u2019s Brief, at 10 (citation omitted). Appellant\u2019s claim is rooted in sufficiency. \u201cSpecifically, [appellant] argues that the Commonwealth failed to present sufficient evidence ... to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that she was guilty of the crimes charged.... \u201d Id., at 12.\nOur Superior Court has dealt with various cases involving conspiracy and third degree murder. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 719 A.2d 778, 785-86 (Pa.Super.1998) (en banc) (defendant can be charged with conspiracy to commit third degree murder because death was natural and probable consequence of such attack, even if defendant did not personally participate in killing); Commonwealth v. La, 433 Pa.Super. 432, 640 A.2d 1336, 1345 (1994) (if killing is natural and probable consequence of co-conspirator\u2019s conduct, murder is not beyond scope of conspiracy); Commonwealth v. Bigelow, 416 Pa.Super. 449, 611 A.2d 301, 304 (1992) (defendant\u2019s participation in conspiracy supported third degree murder conviction as victim\u2019s death was natural and probable consequence of co-conspirator\u2019s conduct); see also Commonwealth v. Wanamaker, 298 Pa.Super. 283, 444 A.2d 1176, 1178 (1982) (defendant\u2019s conduct revealed conscious disregard of great risk of inflicting death or serious bodily harm upon victim\u2014 manifested malice constituted criminal conspiracy to commit third degree murder); but see Commonwealth v. Clinger, 833 A.2d 792, 795-96 (Pa.Super.2003) (because it is impossible for one to intend to commit an unintentional act, it is impossible to commit crime of conspiracy to commit third degree murder).\nThe flaw in appellant\u2019s argument is factual \u2014 the jury found appellant guilty of conspiracy to commit criminal homicide, not conspiracy to commit third degree murder. See Criminal Conspiracy \u2014 Criminal Homicide Verdict Slip, 4/7/06. Appellant was neither charged with nor convicted of conspiracy to commit any specific degree of murder, much less third degree murder \u2014 as such, the issue for which we granted allowance of appeal can only be addressed by putting the proverbial rabbit in the hat, for it is not made out by these facts. Whatever intellectual appeal the syllogism of the appellant\u2019s argument may have, it begs the question. One may certainly be convicted of conspiracy to commit homicide, and the jury\u2019s decision to convict of murder in the third degree does not render the preexisting conspiracy a nonentity.\nPut another way, the ultimate gradation of the crime accomplished does not in and of itself delimit the degree of crime originally planned \u2014 the crime ultimately accomplished does not retroactively limit the scope of the original conspiracy. A jury\u2019s determination of the degree of homicide accomplished does not limit the conspiracy\u2019s scope. If appellant conspired to intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently cause the death of Haith, she may be found guilty regardless of which of those adverbs are found or not found by the jury.\nTo sustain a criminal conspiracy conviction, the Commonwealth must establish a defendant entered into an agreement to commit or aid in an unlawful act with another person or persons, with a shared criminal intent, and an overt act was done in the conspiracy\u2019s furtherance. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903; Commonwealth v. Rios, 546 Pa. 271, 684 A.2d 1025, 1030 (1996) (citations omitted). The overt act need not accomplish the crime \u2014 it need only be in furtherance thereof. In fact, no crime at all need be accomplished for the conspiracy to be committed.\nThe evidence showed appellant solicited Stenger and two other men to drive to Haith\u2019s home; after appellant lured him outside, the two men clubbed Haith while appellant kicked him repeatedly, and Stenger shot Haith in the face at close range. Clearly, this evidence supported the jury\u2019s finding appellant conspired to cause Haith\u2019s death. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2501(a). The evidence clearly supported the jury\u2019s finding appellant entered in an agreement to commit or aid in the unlawful act alleged with Stenger and two others, and an overt act was done in the conspiracy\u2019s furtherance. See id., \u00a7 903. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s conspiracy to commit criminal homicide conviction was proper, and we affirm the Superior Court\u2019s order.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justice BAER and McCAFFERY and Justice GREENSPAN join the opinion.\nJustice GREENSPAN files a concurring opinion in which Chief Justice CASTILLE joins.\nJustice TODD files a dissenting opinion in which Justice SAYLOR joins.\n. The Commonwealth, to its discredit, declined to file a brief in the present matter.\n. Section 903 provides, in relevant part:\n(a) Definition of conspiracy. \u2014 A person is guilty of conspiracy with another person or persons to commit a crime if with the intent of promoting or facilitating its commission he:\n(1) agrees with such other person or persons that they or one or more of them will engage in conduct which constitutes such crime or an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime; or\n(2) agrees to aid such other person or persons in the planning or commission of such crime or of an attempt or solicitation to commit such crime.\n(b) Scope of conspiratorial relationship. \u2014 If a person guilty of conspiracy, as defined by subsection (a) of this section, knows that a person with whom he conspires to commit a crime has conspired with another person or persons to commit the same crime, he is guilty of conspiring with such other person or persons, to commit such crime whether or not he knows their identity.\n(e) Overt act. \u2014 No person may be convicted of conspiracy to commit a crime unless an overt act in pursuant of such conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by him or by a person with whom he conspired.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903(a)-(b),(e)."}
