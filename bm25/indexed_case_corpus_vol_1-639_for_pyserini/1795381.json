{"id": "1795381", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nThe sole issue in this appeal is whether appellant, the State Board of Examiners of Public Accountants, is barred by the equitable doctrine of estoppel by laches from instituting disciplinary proceedings against appellee Harold Weinberg for professional misconduct occurring in 1974. We hold that, under the circumstances of this case, laches does not operate to bar such disciplinary proceedings.\nAppellee is a public accountant certified by the State Board of Examiners of Public Accountants (the Board) pursuant to the C.P.A. Law, Act of May 26, 1947, P.L. 318, \u00a7\u00a7 1-16.2, as amended, 63 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9.1-9.16(b) (Purdon\u2019s 1968). In 1974, appellee handled the account of Southside AMC-Jeep, Inc. (Southside) as a partner in the accounting firm of Winderman, Stein and Weinberg.\nIn the spring of 1974, appellee met with an agent of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to discuss an audit of South-side\u2019s 1973 corporate income tax return which appellee had prepared. The agent indicated that Southside owed additional tax liability for 1973 but made an offer to accept a bribe of $1,500 in return for a. \u201cno-change\u201d audit. In July, 1974, appellee related this offer to the owners of Southside and advised them that, in his opinion, it would be cheaper to pay the bribe than to risk the additional tax liability. Appellee did not conduct an independent review of the 1973 tax return or of the IRS audit to determine the exact amount of any additional tax liability.\nThe owners of Southside gave appellee an envelope containing $1,500. Appellee removed $500 from the envelope and appropriated this money for his personal use. On August 22, 1974, appellee delivered the remaining $1,000 to the IRS agent who then recommended a no-change audit as promised.\nIn early 1975, appellee, through an attorney, voluntarily contacted the IRS and confessed his misdeeds of the previous year. At the request of the IRS, he agreed to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution of the errant IRS agent and others. His cooperation included wearing a \u201cbody wire\u201d to tape record several conversations. As a result of appellee\u2019s cooperation, two IRS agents pleaded guilty to criminal charges in federal district court. Appellee also testified in federal court in 1976, under a grant of immunity, against his former business partner, Stanley Stein, who was convicted of federal charges. For obvious reasons, the partnership had dissolved and appellee began a sole proprietorship in 1975.\nIn 1980, the Board brought formal disciplinary action against Stanley Stein based upon his 1976 federal conviction. In prosecuting this disciplinary action, the Board reviewed appellee\u2019s testimony from the 1976 federal jury trial and learned, for the first time, of appellee\u2019s participation in the 1974 bribery involving Southside. On September 16, 1981, the Board issued a citation and notice of hearing to appellee, charging him with violations of section 9.9a of the C.P.A. Law and of the Board\u2019s regulations. Appellee\u2019s answer essentially admitted the factual allegations of the citation and admitted his participation in the 1974 bribery of the IRS agent. Appellee\u2019s answer additionally asserted the affirmative defense of laches, stating that he \u201cwill be severely prejudiced in his defense and in raising vital mitigating circumstances, because of the passage of over seven (7) years since the occurrence of the events set forth in the citation.\u201d Appellee also requested the Board to consider the \u201cvital mitigating factors\u201d in determining the \u201cultimate discipline to be imposed,\u201d including that \u201chis prior single incident of professional misconduct does not adversely reflect on his current fitness to practice ... accounting\u201d and his \u201cstaunch cooperation with the prosecuting authorities ____\u201d\nAt the hearing held on December 8, 1981, appellee\u2019s testimony at the 1976 Stein trial constituted the Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief. Appellee testified at this hearing and admitted that he had delivered the bribe money to the IRS agent on behalf of Southside and had kept $500 of the money for himself. He also acknowledged that his testimony in the 1976 trial was truthful and accurate. In his defense, however, appellee testified as to his voluntary cooperation in the IRS investigation. He was not able to recall all of the details of that cooperation, nor were the IRS agents involved in the investigation able to recall details of appellee\u2019s participation or locate the IRS files involved.\nOn March 22, 1982, the Board adjudicated appellee guilty of violating the C.P.A. Law and the rules of professional conduct promulgated by the Board, and ordered that appellee\u2019s certificate and permit to practice accounting be suspended for one year. The Board rejected appellee\u2019s defense of laches, holding that there was not undue delay in initiating the disciplinary proceeding and that appellee was not prejudiced in his defense by the delay because, despite the lack of complete recall on the part of appellee and the IRS agents, the Board fully accepted appellee's assertions as to his voluntary cooperation in the IRS investigation. The Board took into account the lapse of time since appellee\u2019s criminal conduct, his subsequent clear record, and his voluntary cooperation in the IRS investigation in arriving at its \u201crather lenient sanction\u201d of a one year suspension.\nAppellee appealed the Board\u2019s adjudication to the Commonwealth Court and petitioned for a stay, which was granted. A Commonwealth Court panel reversed the Board. 76 Pa.Cmwlth. 216, 463 A.2d 1210 (1983) (per Doyle, J., joined by Rogers, J.; Blatt, J. dissenting). The Commonwealth Court held that laches barred the Board from instituting disciplinary proceedings because it had not acted with due diligence and because appellee had been prejudiced by the delay. This Court granted the Board\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal on March 28, 1984 and we now reverse.\nThe parameters of the equitable doctrine of laches are well defined. As a unanimous Court recently reiterated in Class of Two Hundred Administrative Faculty Members v. Scanlon, 502 Pa. 275, 279, 466 A.2d 103 (1983):\n\u201cThe application of the equitable doctrine of laches does not depend upon the fact that a definite time has elapsed since the cause of action accrued, but whether, under the circumstances of the particular case, the complaining party is guilty of want of due diligence in failing to institute his action to another\u2019s prejudice.\u201d Wilson v. King of Prussia Ent., Inc., 422 Pa. 128, 133, 221 A.2d 123, 126 (1966); accord, In Re Estate of Marushak, 488 Pa. 607, 413 A.2d 649 (1980); Leedom v. Thomas, 473 Pa. 193, 373 A.2d 1329 (1977); Holiday Lounge, Inc. v. Shaler Ent., Inc., 441 Pa. 201, 272 A.2d 175 (1971); Siegel v. Engstrom, 427 Pa. 381, 235 A.2d 365 (1967); Truver v. Kennedy, 425 Pa. 294, 229 A.2d 468 (1967). The prejudice required is established where, for example, witnesses die or become unavailable, records are lost or destroyed, and changes in position occur due to the anticipation that a party will not pursue a particular claim. Kay v. Kay, 460 Pa. 680, 685, 334 A.2d 585, 587 (1975); see also Alker v. Philadelphia National Bank, 372 Pa. 327, 93 A.2d 699 (1953).\nThus, it is clear that the application of the defense of laches requires not only an unjustified delay, but also that the opposing party\u2019s position or rights be prejudiced as a result of that delay. Leedom v. Thomas, supra. See also 2 J. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence \u00a7 419d, at 177 (5th ed. 1941). Moreover, \u201c[t]he question of laches is factual and is determined by examining the circumstances of each case.\u201d Leedom v. Thomas, supra, 473 Pa. at 200-201, 373 A.2d at 1332, and cases cited therein.\nFurthermore, the defense of laches is an affirmative defense and the burden of proving laches is, therefore, on the defendant/respondent. See, e.g., Jackson v. State Real Estate Commission, 72 Pa.Cmwlth. 539, 456 A.2d 1169 (1983); Harrington v. Commonwealth Department of State, 58 Pa.Cmwlth. 137, 427 A.2d 719 (1981); Ullo v. State Board of Nurse Examiners, 41 Pa.Cmwlth. 204, 398 A.2d 764 (1979).\nIn applying these principles to the circumstances of this case, it is clear that the Commonwealth Court committed an error of law in holding that appellee has met his burden of proving laches.\nInitially, we reject the Board\u2019s argument that estoppel by laches should not be applied to bar the Commonwealth from initiating disciplinary proceedings by a licensing board. The Board argues that:\nThis Court has never considered whether laches applies to governmental actions taken by state licensing boards. In other contexts, this Court has held the doctrine of estoppel by laches may not be used against the Commonwealth in actions involving performance of a governmental function. For example, where the Commonwealth is exercising its taxing or police power, laches is not a bar to the Commonwealth\u2019s action except in extraordinary circumstances. Since the statutory authority to revoke or suspend a license to practice a profession is the exercise of the government\u2019s police power, the statutory purpose and scheme of state licensing laws does not support the expansion of the doctrine of laches to disciplinary proceedings.\nBrief for Appellant at 8.\nIn Pennsylvania State Board of Medical Education & Licensure v. Shireson, 360 Pa. 129, 61 A.2d 343 (1948), this Court at least implicitly held that the equitable defense of laches can be asserted against the Commonwealth in a disciplinary action by a licensing board. We have also recognized the availability of the defense against the Commonwealth and other governmental units in numerous cases and in a variety of situations, although the courts will be generally reluctant to apply the doctrine against the government and will require a stronger showing by a defendant who attempts to apply the doctrine against the Commonwealth than by one who would apply it against an individual. See e.g., Commonwealth Department of Public Welfare v. UEC, Inc., 483 Pa. 503, 397 A.2d 779 (1979) (Commonwealth estopped from asserting statute of limitations as defense in assumpsit action); Commonwealth ex rel. Margiotti v. Union Traction Co. of Philadelphia, 327 Pa. 497, 194 A. 661 (1937) (Commonwealth estopped by laches from forfeiting the franchise charters of corporations); Heidorn\u2019s Appeal, 412 Pa. 570, 195 A.2d 349 (1963) (municipality estopped by laches from enforcing zoning restriction); Class of Two Hundred Administrative Faculty Members v. Scanlon, supra (Commonwealth estopped by laches from implementing classification system); Stahl v. First Pennsylvania Banking and Trust Co., 411 Pa. 121, 191 A.2d 386 (1963) (Commonwealth estopped by laches from acquiring certain monies held by bank in escheat proceedings); Commonwealth ex rel. Storb v. Schroll, 398 Pa. 354, 157 A.2d 179 (1960) (defense of estoppel by laches may be asserted against Commonwealth in quo warranto proceeding to remove school director from office). While the Board is correct that in some instances, particularly where the taxing power of the state is involved, this Court has held that the defense of laches cannot be asserted against the Commonwealth, these cases merely illustrate the principle that the application of laches involves a factual determination and an ad hoc balancing of conflicting interests in each case. See Commonwealth Department of Public Welfare v. UEC., Inc., supra 483 Pa. at 516, n. 6, 397 A.2d 779; see also Clearview Land Development Co., Inc. v. Commonwealth, 15 Pa.Cmwlth. 303, 327 A.2d 202 (1974). From the foregoing, it is clear that the equitable defense of estoppel by laches is available against the Commonwealth in an administrative disciplinary proceeding by a licensing board, and we expressly approve the consistent body of case law in the Commonwealth Court which so holds.\nHaving decided that the defense of laches is available to appellee in the instant case, we now hold that he has failed to sustain his burden of proving this affirmative defense. Appellee has not demonstrated a lack of due diligence on the part of the Board in initiating this disciplinary action. Appellee concedes that the Board did not actually learn of his misconduct until 1980 during the disciplinary proceeding against his former partner and that the Board acted promptly thereafter. However, the Commonwealth Court accepted appellee\u2019s argument that the Board should be charged with knowledge of his participation in the 1974 bribery misconduct because of the public nature of his testimony in the 1976 federal prosecution of his former partner.\nThe Commonwealth Court held that \u201cwhere, as here, the evidence of wrongdoing becomes a matter of public knowledge, the Board must be diligent to keep abreast of such matters and act promptly____ We find no excuse for the Board\u2019s delay until mid-1980 to discover that C.P.A. Stein had been prosecuted in 1976, and that Weinberg had testified at Stein\u2019s public trial.\u201d 76 Pa.Cmwlth. 216, 463 A.2d at 1212. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the 1976 federal trial was so notorious or the publicity (if any) so pervasive that the Board should have been aware of the trial and of appellee\u2019s testimony given during that trial. There are scores of trial courts in this Commonwealth including all of the courts of common pleas and the federal district courts. To charge the Commonwealth as a matter of law with knowledge of every criminal proceeding in every court, as the Commonwealth Court has done, is unwarranted. Due diligence is a factual determination to be decided under the circumstances of the case, and appellee has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the Board did not act with due diligence. Cf. Heidorn\u2019s Appeal, supra (knowledge of open and conspicuous zoning ordinance violation would be imputed to municipality for purposes of determining whether municipality acted with due diligence in attempting to enforce ordinance) and Commonwealth ex rel. Margiotti v. Union Traction Co. of Philadelphia, supra. (\u201cAfter the validity, or apparent validity, of corporate transactions so conducted in public view has gone unchallenged and has not only been recognized but participated in over the specified period by the General Assembly, by the courts of the Commonwealth and by the Public Service Commission, since its creation, in dealing with these transactions____\u201d, knowledge of transactions imputed to Commonwealth for purposes of determining whether Commonwealth acted with due diligence in attempting to invalidate transactions).\nNeither has appellee met his burden of demonstrating that he has been prejudiced by the delay in this case. Appellee asserts that he has been prejudiced in three ways: (1) that his recollection and that of the IRS agents with whom he cooperated have diminished with time regarding his cooperation and participation in the investigation; (2) that the IRS files concerning the investigation (and his cooperation) cannot now be located; and (3) that he has gone to great expense and inconvenience in establishing his present sole accounting proprietorship and that the delay in instituting disciplinary proceedings have hurt his chances of pursuing alternative business or career opportunities.\nAs to his first two assertions, appellee has not been prejudiced. The Board fully accepted appellee\u2019s testimony regarding his cooperation in the IRS investigation and considered it a mitigating factor, as is reflected in the rather lenient one year suspension imposed for appellee\u2019s admitted serious misconduct. The faded recollections and unavailable IRS files are inconsequential since the Board completely credited appellee\u2019s testimony in this regard. As to appellee\u2019s third assertion, there is also no prejudice demonstrated. Appellee states that the \u201clengthy inaction of the Board induced his detrimental reliance\u201d in establishing a sole proprietorship. Brief for Appellee at 22. The short answer to appellee\u2019s assertion is that the Board\u2019s delay could not so have \u201cinduced his detrimental reliance\u201d since he established his sole proprietorship in 1975 before he had even testified against his business partner in federal court. As we stated in Leedom v. Thomas, 473 Pa. 193, 201, 373 A.2d 1329, 1333 (1977): \u201cLaches is founded on some change in the condition or relations of the parties which occurs during the period the complainant unreasonably failed to act. (citations omitted) It cannot be based on a change of position taking place before the complainant could have and reasonably should have brought suit.\u201d Appellee\u2019s establishment of his sole proprietorship in 1975 was not induced by the Board\u2019s \u201cinaction\u201d, nor did appellee rely on the Board\u2019s \u201cinaction\u201d to his detriment. The Commonwealth Court erred, therefore, in holding that appellee had been prejudiced by the Board\u2019s delay in instituting disciplinary proceedings.\nWe certainly do not condone these delays between judicial findings or admissions of wrongdoing and the initiation of administrative disciplinary proceedings. We note our concern that this problem seems to be arising with increasing frequency. See, e.g., the Commonwealth Court cases cited in text, supra at 151, n. 6; see also Fumo v. State Real Estate Commission, 85 Pa.Cmwlth. 387, 481 A.2d 1257 (1984), petition for allowance of appeal granted July 10, 1985 (more than three year delay between criminal conviction and initiation of disciplinary proceedings based upon the conviction; however, defense of laches held to have been waived) and State Board of Nurse Examiners v. Kindle, 86 Pa.Cmwlth. 468, 485 A.2d 534 (1984), petition for allowance of appeal granted July 10, 1985 (The Commonwealth Court stated: \u201cWe hold that a four year delay [between criminal conviction and initiation of disciplinary proceedings] is excessive and prejudicial per se----\u201d). As the Commonwealth Court in the instant case has pointed out, the Insurance Department has promulgated regulations requiring agents and brokers who have been convicted of, or have plead guilty or nolo contendere to charges of \u201cthe type of criminal conduct which reflects on the honesty and integrity of the agent or broker\u201d, to report such fact to the Department within ten days. 31 Pa.Code \u00a7 33.19(b). Such reporting requirement should eliminate the problem with delay in instituting Insurance Department disciplinary proceedings. While we cannot order other Commonwealth agencies and boards to promulgate similar regulations (for to do so would be legislating), we strongly urge the adoption of similar reporting requirements to alleviate the problem we address today.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we dissolve the stay, reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the order of the State Board of Examiners of Public Accountants suspending appellee\u2019s certificate and permit to practice for one year.\nJUDGMENT\nON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, it is now hereby ordered and adjudged by this Court that the stay is dissolved, the Order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the Order of the State Board of Examiners of Public Accountants suspending appellee\u2019s certificate and permit to practice for one year is reinstated.\nNIX C.J., concurs in the result.\nFLAHERTY, J., did not participate in the consideration and decision of this case.\nPAPADAKOS, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. This section provides, in relevant portion:\n[T]he board ... may revoke or suspend any certificate of certified public accountant ... or may revoke or suspend or refuse to renew any license issued under this act ... for any one of the following causes:\n(2) Dishonesty, fraud or gross negligence in the practice of public accounting.\n(4) Violation of a rule of professional conduct promulgated by the board under the authority granted by this act.\n(10) Conduct discreditable to the public accounting profession.\n63 P.S. \u00a7 9.9a(2), (4) and (10).\n. These regulations, set forth at 49 Pa.Code Chapter 11 provide:\n\u00a7 11.22. Integrity and objectivity.\nA licensee shall not in the performance of professional services knowingly misrepresent facts nor subordinate his judgment to others; in tax practice, however, a licensee may resolve doubt in favor of his client as long as there is reasonable support for his position.\n******\n\u00a7 11.27. Auditing standards and other technical standards.\n******\n(b) Other technical standards. A licensee shall comply with other technical standards promulgated by bodies of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants or other recognized authorities designated to establish such standards, and departures therefrom shall be justified by the licensee who does not follow them.\n. Where the time delay is grossly unreasonable, the defendant\u2019s burden of proof may be proportionately eased and the \"necessity for specifics regarding prejudice or injury becomes less crucial.\u201d Gabster v. Mesaros, 422 Pa. 116, 220 A.2d 639, 641 (1966) (delay of thirty years in instituting action grossly unreasonable so as to lessen defendant\u2019s burden of proving prejudice); Pennsylvania State Board of Medical Education & Licensure v. Shireson, 360 Pa. 129, 61 A.2d 343 (1948) (delay of thirty-four years in instituting decertification proceedings against licensed medical practitioner raised presumption of practitioner\u2019s innocence of charges). In the instant case, however, the time delay between appellee\u2019s misconduct and the Board\u2019s initiation of disciplinary proceedings is not grossly unreasonable under the circumstances so as to alter appellee\u2019s burden of proof.\n. The procedure followed in the suspension or revocation of certificates, registrations or licenses under the C.P.A. Law is that prescribed by the Administrative Agency Law. 63 P.S. \u00a7 9.9. The Administrative Agency Law sets forth our standard of review as follows:\nDisposition of appeal\nThe court shall hear the appeal without a jury on the record certified by the Commonwealth agency. After hearing, the court shall affirm the adjudication unless it shall find that the adjudication is in violation of the constitutional rights of the appellant, or is not in accordance with law, or that the provisions of Subchapter A of Chapter 5 (relating to practice and procedure of Commonwealth agencies) have been violated in the proceedings before the agency, or that any finding of fact made by the agency and necessary to support its adjudication is not supported by substantial evidence. If the adjudication is not affirmed, the court may enter any order authorized by 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 706 (relating to disposition of appeals).\nSee also Norfolk & Western Railway Co. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, 489 Pa. 109, 413 A.2d 1037 (1980).\n. There we stated:\nOur holding today does not affect the validity of Commonwealth v. Western Maryland R.R. Co., 377 Pa. 312, 105 A.2d 336 (1954) and cases of similar ilk wherein a party seeks to apply the doctrine of estoppel by laches against the governmental unit to prevent it from exercising some governmental function. For example, in the Western Maryland case, the railroad company sought to prevent the Commonwealth from collecting a particular tax on the grounds that, since the Commonwealth failed to collect such a tax for the twenty years prior, they should be estopped from collecting it then. We held that failure to collect the tax in the past is no bar to present collection. Mistaken indulgence by, or errors of, the Commonwealth in the past do not insulate the taxpayer from tax liability for subsequent years. Our decision today does not alter that result.\n. See e.g., Harrington v. State Real Estate Commission, supra; Ullo v. State Board of Nurse Examiners, supra; Fumo v. Commonwealth Insurance Department, 58 Pa.Cmwlth. 392, 427 A.2d 1259 (1981); Jackson v. State Real Estate Commission, 72 Pa.Cmwlth. 539, 456 A.2d 1169 (1983)."}
