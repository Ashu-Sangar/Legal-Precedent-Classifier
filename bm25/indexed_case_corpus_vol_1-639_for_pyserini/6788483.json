{"id": "6788483", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice TODD.\nThis is a capital appeal from the order of the Court of Common Pleas of York County denying Appellant Noel Matos Montalvo\u2019s petition for relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. For the reasons that follow, we are constrained to vacate the order and remand this matter to the PCRA court for further proceedings, as discussed below.\nI. Factual and procedural background\nAppellant is the brother of Milton Montalvo (\u201cMilton\u201d). In 1995, Milton and his common law wife, Miriam Ascencio (\u201cMiriam\u201d), moved from Puerto Rico to York County, Pennsylvania. The couple frequently fought, and, around March 1998, Milton moved out of the couple\u2019s apartment. On the evening of April 18,1998, Miriam was seen at a local bar with a friend, Nelson Lugo a/k/a Manuel Santana (\u201cNelson\u201d). At some point during the evening, Miriam and Nelson left the bar and walked to Miriam\u2019s apartment. Later that evening, Vincent Rice, Miriam\u2019s next-door neighbor, was awakened sometime after 11:30 p.m. by the sound of breaking glass on the common porch he shared with Miriam. Rice reported hearing Milton shout \u201copen the door,\u201d after which he heard additional noises coming from the apartment. The following day, April 19, 1998, Rice looked through the window of Miriam\u2019s apartment and observed a man lying on the floor; at this point, he summoned the police.\nWhen the police arrived at the scene, they observed that one pane of a four-pane window in the door to Miriam\u2019s apartment was broken; the broken pane was the closest to the door lock. Upon entering the apartment, the officers discovered Nelson\u2019s body in the kitchen and Miriam\u2019s body in the bedroom. Nelson had defensive wounds on his hands, his fingers were nearly severed, and he had a lipstick inserted in his mouth. Nelson\u2019s autopsy revealed that he died from a stab wound to the chest. Miriam had a broken nose, stab wounds to her eyes, and her head was nearly severed from her body. She was naked from the waist down, and her underwear was around her face. She was lying with her head on a pillow, and a high-heeled shoe was found under her buttocks. Miriam\u2019s autopsy revealed that she died from sharp force and blunt force injuries to her head and neck.\nAccording to the trial testimony of Chris Ann Arrotti, a chemist employed with the Pennsylvania State Police, forensic testing was conducted on more than 70 items collected from the crime scene; approximately 17 of those items contained traces of human blood. Of the items that contained traces of human blood, two of the items contained traces of blood which did not belong to either victim: a white cloth bag found on a sofa bed near Miriam\u2019s body, and a kitchen window blind. The blood on both of those items was determined to belong to Milton Montalvo. Milton Montalvo\u2019s blood also was found on glass that remained in the broken window pane, and a hair collected from Nelson\u2019s hand was determined to belong to Milton Montalvo. There was no blood, hair, or fiber evidence that linked Appellant to the scene of the murders.\nAn arrest warrant was issued for Milton, and, in 1999, he was captured in Florida, and extradited to York County to stand trial for the murders of Miriam and Nelson. Ultimately, he was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of burglary, and, on February 14, 2000, he was sentenced to death. Approximately two months before Milton was arrested, Detective Roland Comacho, purportedly based on a statement given to him by Esther Soto, sought and obtained an arrest warrant for Appellant, charging him as a possible accomplice or participant in the murders. Appellant remained a fugitive until 2002, at which time he was discovered living under an assumed name, with an altered appearance, in Hudson County, New Jersey. Appellant was extradited to York County to stand trial, at which he was represented pro hac vice by Francis Cutruzzula, Esquire. Frank Arcuri, Esquire served as local counsel.\nIn his opening statement at Appellant\u2019s trial, the prosecutor suggested that Appellant wanted to kill Miriam because he \u201cwas angry with Miriam because the ties with Milton had broken down,\u201d and because Miriam knew that Appellant \u201cwas living in this country under an alias having escaped from parole for automobile theft in Puerto Rico.\u201d N.T. Trial, 3/13/03, at 421. The Commonwealth further posited that the victims\u2019 different injuries demonstrated that two different weapons were used \u2014 a knife and some other blunt object \u2014 and, therefore, that there must have been two assailants.\nIn addition to the above-described testimony of Vincent Rice, Miriam\u2019s next-door neighbor, the Commonwealth presented at trial the testimony of Miriam\u2019s downstairs neighbor, Fedelio Morrell. Morrell testified that, on the night of the murders, sometime between 2:00 and 2:30 a.m., he saw Milton at Miriam\u2019s door, and heard him tell her to open the door. Morrell also heard Milton shout that he had seen someone go into Miriam\u2019s apartment. Morrell recounted that, approximately 20 minutes later, he heard a woman\u2019s voice say \u201ccall the police, call the police,\u201d id. at 603, and then he fell asleep. Morrell testified that, 20 minutes after he fell asleep, he heard \u201cnoise on the floor and on the walls and something being dragged.\u201d Id.\nThe Commonwealth also presented Nici Negron, who operated a towing business, as a witness. Negron testified that Milton called him at around midnight on April 18, 1998, and when he arrived approximately one-half hour later at the location Milton specified, he observed Milton, \u201ca pregnant [woman], and Milton\u2019s brother\u201d inside or nearby Milton\u2019s Dodge van. Id. at 505-06.\nPatricia Ascensio, Miriam\u2019s niece, was also called as a witness by the Commonwealth. Patricia testified that she and her boyfriend, Angel Santos (\u201cAngel\u201d), went to Appellant\u2019s apartment at approximately 9:00 p.m. on the evening of the murders so that Appellant\u2019s wife, who was known as \u201cKetty\u201d or \u201cKathy,\u201d could do Patricia\u2019s hair. Patricia stated that she saw Milton at the apartment at approximately 9:30 p.m., but that Milton left at around 10:00 p.m. N.T. Trial, 3/13/03, at 483. Patricia testified that she and Angel left the apartment at approximately 11:00 p.m., and the only individuals present when they left were Appellant, Ketty, and Appellant\u2019s son. Id.\nAs the Commonwealth was unable to locate Angel Santos at the time of trial, the parties agreed to allow Angel\u2019s statements to Detective Lisa Daniels to be introduced through Detective Daniels\u2019 testimony. According to the police report prepared by Detective Daniels, Angel reported that he and Patricia were at Appellant\u2019s apartment with Appellant and Appellant\u2019s wife at approximately 12:30 a.m. on the morning of April 19, 1998; that Milton arrived sometime later and appeared \u201cupset,\u201d \u201cagitated,\u201d \u201chyped,\u201d and \u201csweating profusely\u201d; that Milton asked Appellant, and then Angel, for $20; that Milton left the apartment between approximately 1:15 and 1:30 a.m. on the morning of April 19; and that he and Patricia left the apartment at approximately 2:00 a.m. that same morning. City of York Police Dep\u2019t Supplement to Complaint Report, 4/19/98; N.T. Trial, 3/13/03, at 580-81.\nThe only evidence presented by the Commonwealth to connect Appellant to the murders was the testimony of Esther Soto (\u201cEsther\u201d). Esther testified that, on the afternoon of April 18, 1998, Milton visited the grocery store she operated with her husband at the time, Miguel Soto (\u201cMiguel\u201d). Esther testified that Milton used the store\u2019s telephone to call Miriam about unemployment checks she had received in the mail, that an argument ensued, and that she heard Milton shouting at Miriam over the telephone. As Milton was shouting at Miriam, Appellant entered the store and approached Milton. According to Esther, after Milton ended his telephone call, she heard him tell Appellant that he wanted to kill Miriam. Appellant told Milton to \u201cleave it to him,\u201d and stated that he would kill Miriam himself. N.T. Trial, 3/14/03, at 619.\nEsther recounted that, later that evening, after she and Miguel were asleep, Milton and Appellant arrived at their house. Esther stated that she remained in bed while Miguel opened the door, and then she overheard Milton and Appellant describe to Miguel how they murdered Miriam and Nelson. Esther also testified that she recalled hearing Appellant tell her husband that he killed Miriam by cutting her throat, stabbing her in the eyes, and kicking her as she lay on the floor. According to Esther, Milton and Appellant wanted to stay at her house, but she and Miguel told them they could not stay; Miguel then gave them some money, and Milton and Appellant stated they were going to Florida. Id. at 623.\nEsther claimed that, a day or so after the murders, she saw in the newspaper a telephone number for individuals who had information regarding the murders, and that, approximately two weeks after the murders, she called the police. Thereafter, Esther gave a recorded statement to Detective Comacho, telling him that she had overheard Milton tell Miguel that he killed Nelson, and that she overheard Appellant tell Miguel that he killed Miriam. Id. at 626-28.\nOn cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Esther regarding her testimony that she called the police two weeks after the murders, when, in fact, she did not give a statement to Detective Comacho until December 12, 1998, nearly eight months later. Although Esther initially indicated that she did not remember, id. at 660, she then admitted that she only contacted police at that time because she was \u201ctrying to get [her] van back\u201d after it was taken into custody by Detective Comacho. Id. at 661.\nAdditionally, after Esther admitted on direct examination that, when testifying at Milton\u2019s trial, she repeatedly stated that she did not remember any statements made by Appellant, defense counsel asked Esther whether, in light of her changed testimony at Appellant\u2019s trial, she was admitting to lying during her testimony at Milton\u2019s trial. Id. at 638. Esther repeatedly stated that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t lie,\u201d and she maintained that she did not believe that claiming she didn\u2019t remember something was the same as lying. Id. at 638-39. Defense counsel also confronted Esther with, inter alia, the fact that, at Milton\u2019s preliminary hearing on May 20, 1999, Esther testified that Milton, not Appellant, told her and her husband on the morning of April 19, 1998 that Milton killed Miriam. Id. at 647. Esther responded: \u201cI get nervous that day. I was so nervous all the time I\u2019m nervous. I\u2019m not the same person, okay.\u201d Id. at 649.\nWhen asked by defense counsel if she lied when she testified at Milton\u2019s trial that Detective Comacho had \u201cforced\u201d her to change her testimony at Appellant\u2019s trial; that Detective Comacho \u201cforced her to give the statement\u201d that she gave; that the detective told her that if she didn\u2019t \u201csay what he said[,] my business would be closed and I would go to jail and I won\u2019t see my kids,\u201d id. at 639^40, Esther responded, \u201c[f]or me that is not lying.\u201d Id. at 640. When asked if she saw Detective Comacho in the courtroom at Appellant\u2019s trial, Esther identified him, and when asked \u201cis that the detective that forced you to give this statement back in December of 1998?,\u201d she replied: \u201c[y]es.\u201d Id. at 666.\nEsther\u2019s testimony also conflicted with the testimony given by her husband Miguel Soto, a defense witness. Miguel testified that, in the early morning hours of April 19, 1998, his wife woke him up because someone was knocking at the door. N.T. Trial, 3/18/03, at 245. Miguel answered the door to Milton and Appellant. Id. When asked what, if anything, Milton said to him when he opened the door, Miguel replied, \u201cMilton told me \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say this \u2014 that he had killed his wife.\u201d Id. Miguel testified that Milton did not explain how he killed his wife, but simply stated that \u201che had problems with the police because he had killed his wife,\u201d and that \u201che had to leave and he wanted to know if he could leave his brother \u2014 and that\u2019s when I found out [Appellant] was his brother \u2014 could stay at my house.\u201d Id. Miguel testified that Esther was upstairs when Milton made this statement. Id. at 246. After approximately 25 minutes, Miguel told them he did not want any problems and that Esther did not want them staying in the house, so they left. Id. at 247. When asked on cross-examination why he did not go to the police, Miguel explained that he intended to go to the police, but Esther convinced him not to do so because it would cause problems. Id. at 248-49. Miguel testified that he told Detective Coma-cho that Milton admitted to killing his wife when Miguel was interviewed by the detective nine months later, in November 1998, when he had problems obtaining the registration for his vehicle. Id. at 263.\nIn March 2003, more than three years after Milton was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of Miriam and Nelson, a jury convicted Appellant of first-degree murder for the death of Miriam, second-degree murder for the death of Nelson, conspiracy to commit murder, and burglary. At the penalty phase of trial, the jury found two aggravating circumstances \u2014 that Appellant killed Miriam during the perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(6), and Appellant had been convicted of another murder committed either before, or at the time of, the offenses at issue, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(d)(ll). The jury also found two mitigating factors \u2014 that Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(e)(1), and Appellant was a good worker, attended church, and was a good son to his mother, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(e)(8) (the \u201ccatch-all\u201d miti-gator). Ultimately, the jury determined the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances, and recommended a sentence of death.\nOn April 14, 2003, the trial court imposed a sentence of death in connection with Miriam\u2019s murder, a sentence of life imprisonment for Nelson\u2019s murder, and concurrent terms of 10 to 20 years incarceration each for burglary and conspiracy to commit murder. Appellant filed a direct appeal to this Court, during which he was represented by Gerald Anthony Lord, Esquire. On appeal, Appellant raised a variety of claims, including claims alleging ineffectiveness of trial counsel. On September 24, 2008, this Court affirmed Appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence, holding, inter alia, that Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claims must be deferred to post-conviction proceedings pursuant to Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726 (2002). Commonwealth v. (Noel) Montalvo, 598 Pa. 263, 956 A.2d 926 (2008).\nOn July 27, 2009, Appellant filed a timely pro se PCRA petition. On November 5, 2009, Attorney Lord was granted leave to withdraw and Jeffrey Marshall, Esquire, was appointed to represent Appellant. Attorney Marshall filed an amended PCRA petition on Appellant\u2019s behalf on February 1, 2010. Then, on April 29, 2011, Attorney Marshall filed a supplement to the amended PCRA petition. Between March and September 2011, the PCRA court, by Judge Sheryl Ann Dorney, conducted four days of hearings, and, on January 29, 2013, by opinion and order, Judge Dorney dismissed Appellant\u2019s amended PCRA petition. On February 27, 2013, Appellant filed a notice of appeal to this Court, and subsequently filed a statement of matters complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). On May 16, 2013, Judge Dorney issued an opinion disposing of Appellant\u2019s 15-plus claims raised on appeal, in many instances simply referring to her January 29, 2013 opinion and order.\nOn August 23, 2013, Appellant filed a motion to amend and supplement his Rule 1925(b) statement. As Judge Dorney had retired effective August 1, 2013, the matter was assigned to Judge Michael E. Bortner, who, on November 27, 2013, granted Appellant\u2019s motion to amend his 1925(b) statement. On December 2, 2013, Appellant filed an \u201cAmended and Supplemental Statement of Matters Complained of Under [Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) ]\u201d. On December 3, 2013, Judge Bortner filed a single-page order denying Appellant PCRA relief, and stating, \u201c[t]his Court defers to the reasoning and decision entered by the Honorable Judge Dorney of the York County Court of Common Pleas on January 29, 2013.\u201d Order, 12/3/13. The matter is now before this Court, wherein Appellant raises the following claims:\n1. The court\u2019s failure to provide Petitioner with the resources necessary to develop and present evidence supporting his claims involving the denial of his constitutional rights violated Petitioner\u2019s Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and his rights under Article I, Sections 1, 6, 9, 13,14, 25, and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n2. The Court erred in denying relief where counsel\u2019s abject failure to investigate or prepare in any manner for Petitioner\u2019s penalty hearing violated Petitioner\u2019s Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and his rights under Article I, Sections 1, 9, 13 and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n3. The court erred in denying relief where, as a result of court error, prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel, the sentencing jury was misinformed that its sentencing verdict would be a recommendation but that ultimate responsibility for Petitioner\u2019s death sentence rested elsewhere, in violation of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711; Article I, Sections 9 and 13; and the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise these claims.\n4. The court erred in denying relief where, as a result of prosecutorial misconduct, ineffective assistance of counsel, and court error, irrelevant non-statutory aggravation was presented and considered by the jury in reaching its sentencing determination in violation of Petitioner\u2019s Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and his rights under Article I, Sections 1, 6, 9 13, 14, 25 and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n5. The court erred in denying relief where the penalty phase jury instructions violated the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and Article I, Sections 1, 6, 9,13,14, 25 and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n6. The court erred in denying relief where the jury was not instructed, in violation of the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments that, under Pennsylvania Law, a sentence of life imprisonment means life without possibility of parole.\n7. The court erred in denying relief where, as a result of ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct and court error, the jury did not hear evidence of Petitioner\u2019s innocence and Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death despite his innocence in violation of Petitioner\u2019s Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and his rights under Article I, Sections 1, 6, 9, 13, 14, 25 and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n8. The court erred in denying relief where the prosecution\u2019s election to pursue inconsistent theories of prosecution by first claiming that Petitioner\u2019s co-defendant was the actual murderer during the co-defendant\u2019s trial and then arguing that Petitioner was the murderer in Petitioner\u2019s subsequent trial violated Petitioners Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and his rights under Article I, Sections 1, 6, 9, 14, 25, 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n9. The court erred in denying relief where the selection of a death qualified jury where Petitioner is innocent of death and Milton Montalvo\u2019s jury verdict precluded the Commonwealth from seeking death, violated Petitioner\u2019s Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and his rights under Article I, Sections 1, 9, 13, 14, 25 and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n10. The court erred in denying relief where, as a result of court error and ineffective assistance of counsel, Petitioner was denied a fair and impartial jury in violation of his rights under the Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments and his rights under Article I, Sections 1, 6, 9 and 13 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n11. The court erred in denying relief where Petitioner was denied a fair and impartial jury in violation of his Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights and his rights under Article I, Sections 1, 9, 26 and 28 of the Pennsylvania Constitution because the York County jury selection procedure systematically excluded minorities.\n12. The court erred in denying relief where numerous instances of prosecutorial misconduct, individually and collectively, deprived petitioner of his Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights and his rights under Article I, Sections 1, 6, 9, 13, 14, 25 and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n13. The court erred in denying relief where the guilty phase instructions violated Petitioner\u2019s Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Trial and appellate counsels\u2019 failures to litigate these errors constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.\n14. The court erred in denying relief where, as a result of court error, prosecutorial misconduct and ineffective assistance of counsel, the jury was exposed to constitutionally prohibitive identification testimony in violation of Petitioner\u2019s Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and Article I, Sections 1, 6, 9, 13,14, 25 and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n15. The court erred in denying relief where the admission of detective Comacho\u2019s summary of Petitioner\u2019s purported statement to the police after his illegal arrest violated Petitioner\u2019s Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights and his rights under Article I, Sections 1, 9, 13, 14, 25, and 26 of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\n16. The Court erred in denying relief because the cumulative effect of the errors require grant of relief.\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 4-6.\nII. Analysis\nIn reviewing the denial of PCRA relief, we examine whether the PCRA court\u2019s determination is \u201csupported by the record and free of legal error.\u201d Commonwealth v. Rainey, 593 Pa. 67, 928 A.2d 215, 223 (2007). To be entitled to PCRA relief, an appellant must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the enumerated errors in 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9543(a)(2); his claims have not been previously litigated or waived, id. \u00a7 9543(a)(3); and the failure to litigate the issue prior to or during trial or on direct appeal could not have been the result of any rational, strategic, or tactical decision by counsel. Id. \u00a7 9543(a)(4). An issue is previously litigated if \u201cthe highest appellate court in which [the appellant] could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9544(a)(2). An issue is waived if appellant \u201ccould have raised it but failed to do so before trial, at trial, ... on appeal or in a prior state postconviction proceeding.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9544(b).\nIn order to obtain relief on a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel, a PCRA petitioner must satisfy the performance and prejudice test set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). In Pennsylvania, we have applied the Strickland test by requiring that a petitioner establish that (1) the underlying claim has arguable merit; (2) no reasonable basis existed for counsel\u2019s action or failure to act; and (3) the petitioner suffered prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s error, with prejudice measured by whether there is a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding would have been different. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 567 Pa. 186, 786 A.2d 203, 213 (2001). In other words, prejudice is assessed in terms of whether the petitioner has shown that the demonstrated ineffectiveness sufficiently undermines confidence in the verdict. Commonwealth v. Fletcher, 586 Pa. 527, 896 A.2d 508, 516 n. 10 (2006). Counsel is presumed to have rendered effective assistance, and, if a claim fails under any required element of the Strickland test, the court may dismiss the claim on that basis. Commonwealth v. Ali, 608 Pa. 71, 10 A.3d 282, 291 (2010).\nOf critical relevance to the present appeal, this Court repeatedly has explained that, in order to enable appellate review, PCRA courts are required to provide a \u201clegally robust discussion, complete with clear findings of fact where required.\u201d Commonwealth v. Dennis, 597 Pa. 159, 950 A.2d 945, 957 (2008) (\u201cA generic statement that the record proves [PCRA] claims collectively non-meritorious tells us too little to support review.\u201d); see also Commonwealth v. Weiss, 604 Pa. 573, 986 A.2d 808, 816 n. 4 (2009) (\u201ca fact-finding court should support its determinations with sufficient explanations of the facts and law, including specific citations to the record for all evidence on which it relies, and to the legal authority on which it relies, to facilitate appellate review\u201d); Commonwealth v. Daniels, 600 Pa. 1, 963 A.2d 409, 435 (2009) (holding that, where PCRA court failed to explain the basis for its conclusion that claims were meritless, we could not conduct meaningful appellate review).\nWhere a PCRA court fails to support its holding with sufficient explanations of the facts and law, or fails to provide an adequate opinion addressing all of the claims raised in a PCRA petition, including factual and credibility disputes, a remand is appropriate. See Weiss, 986 A.2d at 816 (remanding the matter to the PCRA court to address the \u201csalient inquiry\u201d of whether appellant received a fair trial, which will \u201cnecessarily entail a review of all the evidence presented at trial\u201d); Daniels, supra (remanding matter to PCRA court for opinion addressing all of PCRA petitioner\u2019s claims); Commonwealth v. Peoples, 599 Pa. 254, 961 A.2d 109, 110 (2008) (per curiam) (remanding to the PCRA court with directions \u201cto resolve areas of material factual controversy and credibility disputes via numbered factual findings and to provide properly framed legal conclusions grounded in the criteria governing claims of deficient attorney stewardship\u201d). In addition, such a remand may necessitate further proceedings below. See e.g. Peoples, supra; Commonwealth v. Beasley, 600 Pa. 458, 967 A.2d 376, 391 (2009) (upon remand to allow the PCRA court to address issues relating to the appellant\u2019s claims of ineffectiveness, PCRA court may \u201ctake all action necessary to conform the record to the [layering requirements of Commonwealth v. McGill, 574 Pa. 574, 832 A.2d 1014 (2003)], including the admission of supplemental evidence.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Roy Williams, 557 Pa. 207, 732 A.2d 1167, 1181 (1999) (because PCRA court failed to make an independent credibility determination regarding proposed testimony, and because the PCRA court as factfinder is in a superior position to make such determinations, PCRA court was directed, on remand, to conduct a hearing, and render its own, independent findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding the credibility of the proposed testimony, as well as its impact on the truth-determining process).\nUnfortunately, the PCRA court\u2019s opinion in the instant case is deficient. In its January 29, 2013 Opinion and Order, issued after four days of hearings on Appellant\u2019s PCRA petition, the PCRA court inexplicably quoted nearly verbatim, and sequentially addressed, the issues set forth in Appellant\u2019s Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statements filed on direct appeal. See Statement of Issues Pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b), 12/18/03; Amended Concise Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal, 8/12/05. This discussion comprised the first 54 pages of the PCRA court\u2019s 55-page opinion.\nMoreover, the PCRA court did not discuss Appellant\u2019s PCRA petition, or the appropriate standard for relief, until the last two pages of its opinion. The PCRA court\u2019s discussion in that regard reads, in its entirety:\nIn the Motion before the Court, the Defendant primarily alleges ineffective assistance of all attorneys who represented him prior to his current counsel. In addition, the Defendant alleges prosecutorial misconduct, court error, illegal arrest and various constitutional violations as a result thereof, and multiple constitutional violations.\nIn order to receive relief under the Post-Conviction Collateral Relief Act, a Defendant must prove 1) that he has been convicted of a crime, 2) that he is currently serving a sentence, awaiting execution of a death sentence, or is serving a sentence that must expire before he may begin serving the sentence in question, 3) the conviction resulted from an enumerated constitutional or statutory violation, 4) the allegation(s) has/have not been previously litigated or waived, and 5) the failure to litigate the issue(s) previously was not the result of a rational, strategic or tactical decision by counsel.\nWhen alleging ineffective assistance of counsel, a Defendant bears the burden of proof. Counsel is presumed to be effective and the burden is on the Defendant to prove otherwise. He must demonstrate that 1) the underlying substantive claim(s) has/have arguable merit, 2) that there was no reasonable basis for counsel\u2019s action or failure to act, and 3) the Defendant suffered prejudice because of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\nAfter considering the testimony from trial, the testimony and exhibits from the hearings on the Defendant\u2019s present petition(s), arguments and briefs of counsel, we find that the Defendant has failed to prove that he is entitled to relief under the Post Conviction Collateral Relief Act.\nPCRA Court Opinion, 1/29/13, at 54-55.\nFurthermore, in response to Appellant\u2019s initial Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement, Judge Dorney issued a 7-page opinion which largely referred back to her January 19, 2013 opinion. Further complicating matters, following Judge Dorney\u2019s retirement and the filing of Appellant\u2019s amended supplemental Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b) statement, Judge Bortner addressed the supplemental issues in a single-page order in which he merely deferred to the prior opinions of Judge Dorney, which, as observed above, were insufficient.\nAs a result of the PCRA court\u2019s failures, this Court has no findings of fact, no determinations of credibility, and no legal conclusions regarding Appellant\u2019s PCRA claims; in short, we have no basis upon which to conduct meaningful appellate review. In that there were more than 10 expert, lay, and other witnesses who testified at the PCRA hearings, including those noted above, see supra note 7, the lack of any credibility determinations by the PCRA court is particularly problematic in the instant case. Thus, we are constrained to remand this matter to the PCRA court. We recognize that, as Judge Dorney is no longer on the bench, the matter must be assigned to another judge. Further, we acknowledge that the judge to whom the matter is assigned will not have the benefit of having presided over Appellant\u2019s PCRA hearings. Thus, for those claims the assigned judge is unable to resolve on the existing record, the judge is authorized to conduct additional hearings, and admit evidence, as necessary. Peoples, supra; Beasley, supra; Williams, supra.\nThe order of the PCRA court is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice SAYLOR, Justices EAKIN, BAER and STEVENS join the opinion.\n. The various witnesses at Appellant\u2019s trial provided different, and often inconsistent, estimations of the hour at which these events occurred.\n. Attorney Cutruzzula testified at Appellant's PCRA hearing that he met Appellant in the \"bull pen\u201d of the Hudson County Court House, following Appellant\u2019s arrest. When there was no public defender available to handle Appellant\u2019s extradition matter, the presiding criminal judge asked Attorney Cutruzzula to \"stand in\u201d and Attorney Cutruz-zula met with Appellant in the jury room to discuss his extradition rights. Appellant agreed to waive extradition, and Attorney Cutruzzula ultimately was retained to represent Appellant in his homicide trial in Pennsylvania. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 7/11/11, at 5-6.\n. Appellant claims that Angel confirmed the truth of the statements he made to police during his April 19, 1998 interview, but, contrary to representations contained in a police report prepared by Detective Comacho on February 1, 1999 in which Detective Comacho described an interview with Angel and Patricia on that date, denied ever speaking with police'about the murders after his initial April 19, 1998 interview. In support of this claim, Appellant submitted an affidavit from Alejandro Villasenor, a paralegal with the Federal Public Defender which represented Appellant during his federal habeas corpus proceedings, describing conversations he had with Angel.\n. Specifically, at Appellant\u2019s trial, Detective Comacho testified that police had entered information regarding Milton Montalvo\u2019s Dodge van into the National Crime Index Computer (\"NCIC\u201d) system, but erroneously entered the license plate of Miguel Soto\u2019s van, a Ford Aerostar. N.T. Trial, 3/18/04, at 199. As a result, when Miguel attempted to obtain the required registration for his van, there was a \"pop up NCIC hit\u201d for the homicide involving Milton. Id. at 199. Miguel was instructed by PennDot personnel to go to the Lancaster City Police Department, where he was met by Detective Comacho and another officer. Detective Comacho interviewed Miguel, and, upon \"figuring out that he had some sort of connection to Milton,\u201d asked Miguel \"what information ... he had about the homicide.\u201d Id. at 200. According to Detective Comacho, Miguel stated that his wife, Esther, \"also had information around,\u201d and the detective told Miguel he needed to speak with Esther. Id. At that point, Detective Comacho drove to Miguel's store, where he took possession of Miguel\u2019s van and placed it in the city garage. Detective Comacho reiterated to Miguel at that time that he \"needed to talk to Esther.\u201d Id. at 201. Several days later, Esther went in for an interview with Detective Comacho.\n. In this regard, Appellant\u2019s conviction for the murder of Nelson was used as an aggravating factor for sentencing in Appellant\u2019s conviction for the murder of Miriam.\n. On March 22, 2004, prior to sentencing, Mary R. Ennis, Esquire, entered her appearance as counsel for Appellant, and Attorney Ennis filed an Amended Concise Statement of Matters Complained of on Appeal on Appellant\u2019s behalf. Thereafter, Attorney Ennis was granted leave to withdraw as counsel, and, on May 17, 2007, Attorney Lord was appointed to represent Appellant.\n. Witnesses who testified at the PCRA hearings included, inter alia, Attorney Cutruzzula; Angel Santos; R. Robert Tressel, a crime-scene forensic expert; Detective Comacho; Detective Dennis Williams, who conducted several witness interviews; Detective Daniels, Attorney En-nis; Allen Fuentes, an interpreter who assisted with Detective Williams\u2019 interview of Negron; and Attorney Lord.\n. Although Appellant identifies nineteen issues in his Statement of Questions, he indicates that three of those issues were abandoned or duplicative of other claims. Thus, we have not listed those issues herein, and only the remaining sixteen issues are set forth."}
