{"id": "1221658", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThe plaintiff sued in trespass to recover damages from the defendant for the latter\u2019s alleged criminal conversation with the plaintiff\u2019s wife. The defendant filed preliminary objections which questioned the court\u2019s jurisdiction on the grounds that the cause of action, as pleaded by the plaintiff, was for alienation of affections and that the Act of June 22, 1935, P. L. 450, Sec. 1, as amended by the Act of June 25,1937, P. L. 2317, Sec. 1, 48 PS \u00a7 170, abolished such actions save in certain instances not presently material. The learned court below held that the gravaman of the complaint was criminal conversation and that a right of action therefor was not abolished by the Act of 1935, cit. supra. An order dismissing the defendant\u2019s preliminary objections was accordingly entered from which the defendant appeals.\nThe common law has long furnished an aggrieved husband with a right of action against his wife\u2019s adulterer for criminal conversation. Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries (Lewis\u2019 Ed.), Book 3, pp. *139, lists \u201cadultery, or criminal conversation\u201d as one of the three principal \u201cInjuries that may be offered to a person, considered as a husband, . . .\u201d and goes on to state that \u201cAdultery, or criminal conversation with a man\u2019s wife, though it is, as a public crime, left by our laws to the coercion of the spiritual courts; yet, considered as a civil injury (and surely there can be no greater,) the law gives a satisfaction to the husband for it by action of trespass vi et armis against the adulterer. ...\u201d In Tinker v. Colwell, 193 U. S. 473, 481-485, Mr. Justice Peckham, speaking for the Supreme Court of the United States on a question as to whether a judgment for criminal conversation is released by the defendant\u2019s discharge in bankruptcy, considered at length the nature of the tort, reviewed cases from England and from various States of the Union and confirmed that, at common law, a husband has a separate right of action for criminal conversation.\nSection 685 of the Restatement, Torts, specifically affirms the existence of a cause of action for criminal conversation as distinguished from an action for alienation of affections, which is treated with in \u00a7 683. The fact that both of such causes may be joined in one suit is merely a matter of procedural permission: Restatement, Torts, \u00a7 683, Comment c. And, while the liability in the tivo actions is, in general, the same, viz., \u201cfor the harm thereby caused to any of [the husband\u2019s] legally protected marital interests\u201d (compare \u00a7 683 and \u00a7 685 of the Restatement, Torts), the causes represent nonetheless two distinct torts, \u2014 \u201cone may exist without the other.\u201d See Corpus Juris Secundum, Yol. 42, p. 320, \u00a7 668, where it is also pointed out that \u201cThe lack of necessity for a physical debauchment distinguishes alienation of affections from criminal conArersation.\u201d And, a single act of adultery is sufficient to entitle the husband of the woman to damages in an action against the adulterer for criminal conversation even though the husband sustains no further loss: see \u00a7 683, Comment c. and \u00a7 685, Comment b. of the Restatement, Torts. On the other hand, sexual intercourse between the Avife and an alienator of her affections is not a requisite to an action for damages for the husband\u2019s consequent loss: Restatement, Torts, \u00a7 683, Comment c. Knowledge or belief that a woman is married is essential to liability for alienation of her affections while such knowledge is not necessary to liability for criminal conversation Avith her. A man who has sexual relations Avith a woman, not his wife, assumes the risk that she is married. Even her misrepresentation that she is single affords the offender no defense to liability for criminal conversation: Restatement, Torts, \u00a7685, Comment d. We think there can be no doubt that alienation of affections and criminal conversation are two separate and distinct torts and that, for each, the common law affords a right of action unless, of course, the same has been statutorily abolished.\nThe Act of 1935, supra, did not abolish rights of action for criminal conversation. Nowhere therein is that cause mentioned or referred to. Nor may it be read into the statute by implication. The Act being in diminution of the jurisdiction of the courts of Common Pleas of the Commonwealth, it is not to be presumed that the legislature intended thereby to abolish a right of action not expressly brought within the statute\u2019s purview. Sec. 58 (7) of the Statutory Construction Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, 46 PS \u00a7 558, requires that all provisions of a law decreasing the jurisdiction of a court of record be strictly construed. Indeed, Ave do not understand the defendant to contend that the Act of 1935, as amended, abolishes a right of action for criminal conversation if that subject-matter be, as Ave herein hold it to be, a cause of action separate and distinct from alienation of affections.\nThe appellant\u2019s further contention is that the cause pleaded by the plaintiff is for alienation of affections and not criminal conversation. With that, we do not agree. It is evident from the complaint that the gist of the alleged Avrong is that the defendant \u201c. . . on November 29th, 1948, at the City of McKeesport, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and on divers other days and times prior thereto, wrongfully, wickedly, and unjustly debauched and carnally knew the said Mary Antonelli, then and there, and still being the wife of the said plaintiff.\u201d And, while it is true, as we have hereinbefore noted, that the elements of damage for which recovery can be had are, broadly speaking, the same for both alienation of affections and criminal conversation, the injuries averred in the instant complaint are such as are peculiarly associated with an action for criminal conversation, e. g., injury to the husband\u2019s social position, irreparable disgrace in the community where he lived and was engaged in business and dishonor to himself and his family.\nOrder affirmed.\nFor a more recent lower court case holding to same effect see Grove v. Widney (C. P., Franklin Co.), 68 D. & C. Rpts. 541."}
