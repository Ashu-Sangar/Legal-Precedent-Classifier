{"id": "12279952", "contents": "OPINION\nJUSTICE BAER\nIn this discretionary appeal, we are asked to determine the narrow issue of whether Law Enforcement Health Benefits, Inc. (\u201cLEHB\u201d), a nonprofit corporation that administers health and welfare benefits to Philadelphia police officers as part of the union\u2019s collective bargaining agreement, is authorized under the Pennsylvania Nonprofit Corporation Law (\u201cNCL\u201d), 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5101-6162, as well as its Articles of Incorporation, to expend its corporate funds to pay for a postcard sent to its members endorsing a candidate in a union election. For the reasons that follow, we find that nothing in the NCL nor the corporation\u2019s Articles prohibited the action at issue and that LEHB\u2019s action was sufficiently related to its corporate purpose to be permissible. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order dismissing the declaratory judgment action against LEHB.\nThe facts of this case are not in dispute. The Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge No. 5 (\u201cFOP\u201d) is a union which represents the interests of Philadelphia police officers in negotiating the terms and conditions of the officers\u2019 employment with the City of Philadelphia (\u201cCity\u201d). Relevant to the instant matter, the FOP secured a collective bargaining agreement with the City, which provides health and welfare benefits to active and retired FOP members and their families. The agreement, inter alia, created a Joint Trust and established a Joint Trust Board, which is comprised of five individuals\u2014four appointed by the FOP president and one appointed by the City\u2014who supervise and manage the delivery of the FOP\u2019s benefits. As a result of the negotiations between the FOP and the City, the City is required to pay a specified amount per police officer per year to the Joint Trust for benefits, and the Joint Trust Board selects the entity to administer such benefits. At all relevant times, the Joint Trust Board selected LEHB to administer the benefits. LEHB is a nonprofit corporation specifically incorporated for the purpose of administering the benefits for the City\u2019s police officers and is controlled by a Board of Directors (\u201cthe Board\u201d).\nAs LEHB is a nonprofit corporation, it is governed by the NCL. The NCL requires nonprofit corporations to be incorporated for a purpose, specified in its articles, \u201cincluding, but not limited to, any one or more of the following or similar purposes\u201d listed in Section 5301(a).15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5301(a); see also id. \u00a7 5306(a)(3) (providing that a nonprofit corporation\u2019s articles of incorporation must contain \u201c[a] brief statement of the purpose or purposes for which the corporation is incorporated\u201d). Consistent with that mandate, LEHB\u2019s Articles of Incorporation provide, in pertinent part, as follows:\n4. The purpose of the Corporation is:\n(a) to receive, hold, invest, administer, and distribute funds to provide health and welfare benefits for, and on behalf of, the Corporation\u2019s members (and such members\u2019 eligible spouses and dependents), who are the members of the Fraternal Order of Police, Lodge No. 5 (a Pennsylvania nonprofit corporation) who are eligible to participate in the Blue Cross/Blue Shield health insurance plan (or such other health insurance plan) that is to be maintained by the Corporation for the benefit of such members;\n(b) to engage in such other proper purposes incidental to the foregoing;\n(c) to engage in all other proper operations for which corporations may be formed and operated under the Pennsylvania Not-for-Profit Code.\nAddendum to Articles of Incorporation at 1 (Reproduced Record \u201cR.R.\u201d at 282a) (\u201cArticles\u201d).\nIn 2010, Appellee Frank Zampogna, a Philadelphia police officer, campaigned for FOP President, running against the incumbent FOP President, John McNesby. Leading up to the election, McNesby informed LEHB that Zampogna had been making pronouncements to FOP members regarding their medical benefits and the City\u2019s monthly contributions. These pronouncements were viewed by LEHB as misrepresentations designed to gain political advantage in the FOP election. Given this concern, a few weeks before the election, the Board unanimously voted to \u201crespond appropriately\u201d if \u201cany candidate misstates, misrepresents, or publishes misleading or false information regarding LEHB or demeans its officers.\u201d Active Directors Meeting Minutes, 9/7/2010, at 1 (R.R. at 227a).\nFollowing the Board meeting, and in response to Zampog-na\u2019s allegedly false statements, LEHB mailed postcards to FOP members which, inter alia, endorsed McNesby in the election, accused \u201c[o]ne of the FOP Presidential candidates\u201d of making \u201cgrossly misleading and deceptive statements\u201d regarding LEHB, and opined that that candidate \u201cis not competent enough and too inexperienced to lead the FOP and its 14,000 members.\u201d Postcard (R.R. at 222a). The cost to mail and print the postcards totaled $8,840 and was paid out of LEHB\u2019s general funds. LEHB\u2019s administrator, Thomas Lamb, stated that McNesby was not involved in the decision to mail the postcard, and Zampogna did not present any evidence to the contrary. See N. T., 1/10/2012, at 57.\nSix days before the election, in response to the mailing, Zampogna filed an action seeking declaratory relief barring LEHB from further expending its funds to endorse a candidate in an FOP election. In support of his position, Zampogna argued that LEHB\u2019s expenditure was in \u201cdirect violation\u201d of LEHB\u2019s Bylaws, Articles, and the NCL. Zampogna\u2019s Amended Complaint at 7-8 (R.R. at 214-15a). Additionally, Zampog-na claimed that LEHB\u2019s actions were \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201can unlawful expenditure of public funds given solely for medical benefit purposes.\u201d Id. at 5, 8 (R.R. at 212a, 215a).\nWhile the case was pending, Zampogna lost the election. The case subsequently proceeded to a nonjury trial, and, ultimately, the trial court denied Zampogna\u2019s request for declaratory relief. The trial court began its review with LEHB\u2019s Bylaws, which provided the Board with the power to take any action so long as it was not inconsistent with the Bylaws, the Articles, or the law. The trial court concluded that neither LEHB\u2019s Bylaws, nor its Articles, prohibited LEHB from making endorsements in FOP elections. Moreover, the trial court examined Section 5502 of the NCL, which enumerates the general powers of nonprofit corporations, and determined that \u201c[njowhere in [the] statute does it state that corporations are prohibited from engaging in political activity.\u201d Tr. Ct. Op., 5/22/2012, at 2 (citing 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5502). Zampogna filed post-trial motions, which the court denied, and he appealed, asserting, inter alia, that the trial court erred in finding that LEHB\u2019s actions in endorsing a candidate in the FOP election did not violate LEHB\u2019s Articles, Bylaws, or the NCL.\nOn appeal, a split en banc panel of the Commonwealth Court reversed. Zampogna v. Law Enforcement Health Benefits, Inc., 81 A.3d 1043 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2013). The majority acknowledged that the NCL grants a nonprofit corporation the power to take several actions, including making \u201ccontributions and donations,\u201d albeit \u201csubject to the limitations and restrictions contained in its articles.\u201d Zampogna, 81 A.3d at 1047 (quoting 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5502(a)). However, the majority disagreed with the trial court that the action at issue was not restricted by LEHB\u2019s Articles. Instead, the majority viewed LEHB\u2019s purpose statement as a restriction on its powers, reasoning that any action taken by the corporation must be sufficiently related to its purpose \u201cto receive, hold, invest, administer, and distribute funds to provide health and welfare benefits for, and on behalf of, the corporation\u2019s members (and such members\u2019 eligible spouses and dependents).\u201d Id. at 1048 (quoting Articles at 4(a)). In the majority\u2019s view, endorsing McNesby was not a direct administration of benefits. To the contrary, the majority concluded, McNesby was \u201can individual unrelated to [LEHB\u2019s] purpose,\u201d and, therefore, mailing the postcard \u201cf[ell] outside of both the Law, and [LEHB\u2019s] Articles of Incorporation.\u201d Id. at 1049.\nThe majority went on to address LEHB\u2019s argument that the endorsement, while not a direct administration of benefits, was nonetheless authorized pursuant to the company\u2019s incidental power. See Articles at 4(b) (providing LEHB with the power \u201cto engage in such other proper purposes incidental to the [administration of benefits].\u201d). In rejecting this argument, the majority relied on a case from 1916 which stated that a corporation\u2019s incidental power must be \u201cdirectly and immediately appropriate to the execution of the specific power granted, ... not one that has merely some slight or remote relation to it.\u201d Id. (quoting Citizens\u2019 Elec. Illuminating Co. v. Lackawanna & W.V.R. Co., 255 Pa. 176, 99 A. 465, 467 (1916)). Here, the majority reasoned, \u201ccampaigning for a union presidential candidate is not directly and immediately appropriate to providing healthcare benefits to the corporation\u2019s Members,\u201d and, thus, it concluded that such activity cannot fall within the scope of LEHB\u2019s incidental power. Id. at 1049-50.\nSeemingly in contradiction to its finding that McNesby\u2019s election had nothing to do with LEHB\u2019s corporate functions, the majority noted its belief that the action here was \u201csuspect\u201d and \u201cegregious\u201d because of the relationship between the FOP president and LEHB, as the president appoints the members of the Joint Trust Board, which ultimately selects the company to administer benefits. Id. at 1050. The majority viewed this construct as creating a conflict of interest for the Board and opined that approving the endorsement constituted self-dealing, despite the fact that Zampogna\u2019s complaint and brief to the Commonwealth Court made no allegation of any conflict of interest.\nFinally, the majority summarily concluded that LEHB \u201cwould be irreparably harmed if the Board\u2019s approval of expenditures of public money for partisan activity was allowed to continue unabated.\u201d Id. at 1051-52. However, the majority did not cite any authority to support its proposition that LEHB\u2019s funds were public nor did it explain how the public character of the funds factored into the court\u2019s analysis. Moreover, the majority did not develop how an action taken in the context of a private, union election constituted prohibited \u201cpartisan activity.\u201d Nonetheless, the majority held that the trial court erred in finding the endorsement was within the scope of the Board\u2019s authority. The Commonwealth Court thus vacated the trial court\u2019s order and remanded for entry of an order \u201cdeclaring that the Board\u2019s expenditure of public funds on partisan activity violates the [NCL], and [LEHB\u2019s] Articles of Incorporation.\u201d Id at 1052.\nJudge Leavitt filed a dissent, joined by Judge Simpson, contending that the action taken fell within the broad powers granted to LEHB by the NCL and its Articles. Zampogna, 81 A.3d at 1052 (Leavitt, J., dissenting). The dissent opined that, contrary to the majority\u2019s position, \u201cit is a restriction that must be stated in the corporation\u2019s charter, not the authorization to conduct a specific activity,\u201d and observed that, here, LEHB\u2019s Articles do not limit LEHB\u2019s ability to endorse candidates in a union election. Id. at 1055. Rather, the dissent concluded that, because the management of the FOP and the outcome of the election would directly impact LEHB, endorsing a candidate whom it determined would best manage the FOP was a permissible use of its incidental power under its Articles.\nAdditionally, the dissent differed with both the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Board engaged in self-dealing, and its characterization of the funds spent by LEHB as public funds. With respect to the former, the dissent emphasized that \u201cany act as the board of directors ... shall be presumed to be in the best interests of the corporation,\u201d id. at 1059 (quoting 15 Pa.C,S. \u00a7 5715(d)), and noted that Zampogna failed to provide clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption. The dissent also opined that a board\u2019s action which it deems \u201c-will serve the continued existence of the corporation\u201d does not create a conflict of interest, and that the NCL specifically provides that a director\u2019s action to retain his position does not constitute self-dealing. Id, at 1060-61 (citing 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5715(e)(2)(iv)). As to the funds paid by LEHB, the dissent suggested the funds were corporate funds rather than public funds because they had been paid to LEHB for services rendered, became part of LEHB\u2019s corporate account, and, thus, had lost their public character.\nFollowing the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision, LEHB filed a petition for allowance of appeal with this Court, which we granted to review whether the Commonwealth Court erred in determining that LEHB\u2019s action of endorsing McNesby was not authorized.\nLEHB begins by contending that the Commonwealth Court invalidated a corporate action simply because the court disagreed with the action. In LEHB\u2019s view, the NCL grants nonprofit corporations broad powers, including: 1) the ability to make donations and contributions; 2) \u201c[t]o have and exercise all of the powers and means appropriate to effect the purpose or purposes for which the corporation is incorporated;\u201d and 3) to exercise all other powers vested in the corporation by law. 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5502(a)(9), (18), (19). Notwithstanding these provisions, LEHB acknowledges that a nonprofit corporation\u2019s powers are subject to any limitation or restriction imposed by statute or the corporation\u2019s articles. 15 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 5502(a). Accordingly, LEHB argues that a nonprofit corporation\u2019s action is authorized unless it is prohibited or restricted.\nHowever, LEHB\u2019s argument does not end with searching for an explicit statement within the corporation\u2019s Articles or the law prohibiting the action at issue, which was the view taken by the trial court here. Instead, like the Commonwealth Court majority, LEHB views its corporate purpose as a restriction contained within its Articles that limits its powers, conceding that any action it takes must be related to providing benefits for its members. Notwithstanding its agreement on the relevance of its corporate purpose, LEHB parts from the Commonwealth Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion, contending that the court failed to consider the entire context of LEHB\u2019s action when it determined the conduct was not related to LEHB\u2019s corporate purpose.\nTo that end, LEHB argues that endorsing McNesby was related to enhancing benefits for its members in two ways. First, LEHB asserts, the FOP President appoints four of the five members of the Joint Trust Board, which has the capability of removing LEHB as the selected vendor to administer benefits. Thus, when Zampogna made what were perceived to be \u201cintentional, material misrepresentations to members\u201d concerning LEHB\u2019s administration of their benefits, LEHB directors became concerned that Zampogna would negatively impact the organization if he were elected. LEHB\u2019s Brief at 19. Second, and more importantly, LEHB directors believed that McNesby would be more efficient than Zampogna in negotiating with the City, which in turn could improve LEHB\u2019s revenue stream and its ability to provide inexpensive benefits. For these reasons, LEHB believes the FOP President is \u201ca matter of direct concern\u201d to LEHB and concludes that its action in endorsing McNesby was \u201cat the very least, incidental to the function of [LEHB],\u201d if not directly related. Id. at 20-22. Accordingly, LEHB asserts its action was sufficiently related to its corporate purpose so as to satisfy the limitation contained within its Articles.\nTurning to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s discussion regarding the alleged conflict of interest, LEHB asserts the Commonwealth Court majority erred because it \u201csimply averr[ed] a conflict of interest\u201d existed \u201cabsent any evidence whatsoever\u201d to support such an averment. Id. at 26. LEHB contends that, pursuant to the NCL, the acts of a director are \u201cpresumed to be in the best interests of the corporation,\u201d and a challenge to such requires clear and convincing evidence to rebut the presumption. Id. at 27 (quoting 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5715(d)). LEHB contends that Zampogna \u201cpresented no evidence ..., let alone clear and convincing evidence\u201d that a conflict of interest existed. Id. at 27 (quoting Zampogna, 81 A.3d at 1059 (Leavitt, J., dissenting)). Indeed, as noted previously, Zampogna did not assert a conflict of interest in his pleadings.\nLastly, LEHB argues the Commonwealth Court majority erred by labeling the assets used to print and mail the postcards at issue as \u201cpublic funds.\u201d While LEHB acknowledges that the funds paid by the City to LEHB originally were public in nature, it suggests that the funds lost their public character once the City transferred them to the Joint Trust pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement. Specifically, LEHB opines that, once the funds leave the City\u2019s possession, the City has met its contractual obligation of contributing a specified amount of money per FOP member. LEHB notes that, thereafter, the funds are either received by the Joint Trust, which forwards the money to LEHB to administer benefits, or the City may pay LEHB directly to reimburse it for expenses which have already been incurred on behalf of an eligible member. LEHB emphasizes that, once the funds are placed in the Joint Trust or forwarded directly to LEHB, they become the private assets of the corporation and, thus, cease to retain their public character.\nBy contrast, Zampogna contends LEHB was not authorized to endorse a candidate in the FOP election. Zampogna argues LEHB\u2019s Articles do not authorize it to endorse a candidate as they make clear that LEHB\u2019s sole purpose is to administer benefits for FOP members and their families. While the Articles also give LEHB incidental power, Zampogna maintains that endorsing a candidate in the FOP presidential election is not incidental to effectuating the payment of benefits.\nFor the first time before this Court, Zampogna claims that LEHB\u2019s action was a conflict of interest because the candidate it endorsed was the then-current FOP president, who appointed four members of the Joint Trust Board, and, thus, in his view, the individual in control of the monies going to LEHB which ultimately funded the mailing endorsing him. Notably, Zampogna does not cite to any evidence of record to support the assertion that LEHB\u2019s board acted under a conflict of interest, such as testimony suggesting that McNesby requested LEHB to endorse him. Instead, taking his lead from the Commonwealth Court\u2019s majority opinion, Zampogna infers a conflict of interest based on the FOP President\u2019s ability to appoint members of the Joint Trust Board. To Zampogna, the conflict of interest \u201cis obvious,\u201d and thus he dispenses with the need to support it. Id at 36.\nLastly, Zampogna repeatedly notes his belief that LEHB\u2019s action was a misuse of public funds. In this vein, Zampogna argues LEHB\u2019s funds have a \u201cpublicly designated purpose\u201d\u2014 namely, the payment of benefits for FOP members and their families. Id. at 40. Consistent with his argument that LEHB\u2019s actions here did not relate to its corporate purpose, Zampogna also contends that LEHB improperly used public funds for a non-public purpose. Again, however, Zampogna cites to no relevant corporate law to support his position that the use of originally \u201cpublic\u201d funds somehow alters or heightens our review of whether a nonprofit corporation\u2019s action is authorized.\nIn this case, we are asked to determine whether a nonprofit corporation\u2019s action was permitted under the NCL, which is a question of law, for which our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. A.S. v. I.S., 130 A.3d 763, 768 (Pa. 2015). Before analyzing the specific action in question, it is worth reviewing a brief history of Pennsylvania corporate law. In the early years of our Commonwealth, corporations were required to be incorporated for a specific purpose and were limited to take only those actions that furthered the corporation\u2019s purpose. Malone v. Lancaster Gas Light & Fuel Co., 182 Pa. 309, 37 A. 932, 933 (1897). Because of this narrow limitation on early corporations\u2019 powers, if a corporation\u2019s action was not \u201cfairly considered incidental or auxiliary to\u201d its corporate purpose, a court could deem the action unauthorized as beyond the scope of the corporation\u2019s authority (ie., ultra vires). Id.\nMalone involved the Lancaster Gas Company, chartered for the specific purpose of \u201cmanufacturing and supplying illuminating and heating gas.\u201d Id. When the company sought to sell gas-consuming appliances, one of the company\u2019s stockholders challenged the action as outside the company\u2019s authority. This Court determined that the action was authorized, holding that a corporation may take any action that is not within the literal terms of the corporate grant so long as it is \u201cat least very convenient\u201d to the corporation\u2019s purpose. Id. at 933. Because selling gas-consuming appliances would increase the demand for Lancaster\u2019s gas supply, this Court concluded that the action was sufficiently related to the corporation\u2019s chartered purpose of selling gas. Compare with Citizens\u2019 Electric Illuminating Co. v. Lackawanna & W.V.R. Co., 255 Pa. 176, 99 A. 465, 467 (1916) (holding that a railroad company was unauthorized to sell excess electricity the company generated because such action was not \u201cdirectly and immediately appropriate\u201d to functioning as a railroad).\nHowever, around the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, states began to \u201creplace the restrictive set-pattern acts of the 1880s with the liberal and flexible \u2018enabling\u2019 corporation statutes that characterized the twentieth century.\u201d Harwell Wells, The Modernization of Corporation Law, 1920-1940, 11 U. Pa. J. Bus. L. 573, 585 (2009). As part of this movement, Pennsylvania enacted its more liberal Business Corporation Law in 1983. See Act of May 5, 1938 (P.L. 364, No. 106) (known as the Business Corporation Law of 1933). The current language of the BCL, as amended in 1988, provides that a \u201cbusiness corporation shall have the legal capacity of natural persons to act,\u201d 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1501, and sets forth a broad, non-exhaustive list of permissible corporate powers. 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1502(a) (granting a business corporation broad corporate powers \u201c[s]ubject to the limitations and restrictions imposed by statute or contained in its articles\u201d); 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1502 Committee Comment\u20141988 (\u201cThe provisions of subsection (a) are intended to be broad enabling provisions.\u201d).\nOne of the effects of Pennsylvania\u2019s modernized corporate statute is to remove the requirement that for-profit corporations be incorporated for a specific, limited purpose; in fact, a business corporation today need not include any purpose statement in its articles of incorporation. 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1301, Committee Comment\u20141988 (\u201cUnder this section if the articles of a business corporation contain no purpose clause, the corporation has in effect an all-purpose charter\u201d). Instead, corporations are permitted to be incorporated for \u201cany lawful purpose,\u201d id. and, accordingly, can take any type of corporate action, regardless of its relationship to a corporation\u2019s purpose. 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1502, Committee Comment\u20141988 (\u201cIt is intended ... that the corporate purposes of the [for-profit] corporation shall be irrelevant.\u201d).\nBecause for-profit corporations are no longer limited to taking actions related to their corporate purposes, the ultra vires doctrine is, in effect, no longer viable to challenge a for-profit corporate action. See Kent Greenfield, Ultra Vires Lives! A Stakeholder Analysis of Corporate Illegality (with Notes on How Corporate Law Could Reinforce International Law Norms), 87 Va. L. Rev. 1279,1280 (2001) (explaining that, today, \u201cthe doctrine of \u2018ultra vires,\u2019 which limited corporations to certain purposes and powers, is dead or at least deathly ill\u201d). Rather, a challenge to a corporate action proceeds in modern jurisprudence under what is known as the business judgment rule, which embodies the \u201cpolicy of judicial noninterference with business decisions of corporate managers,\u201d and insulates corporate directors from \u201csecond-guessing or liability for their business decisions in the absence of fraud or self-dealing or other misconduct or malfeasance.\u201d Cuker v. Mikalauskas, 547 Pa. 600, 692 A.2d 1042, 1046 (1997); see also 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1502 Committee Comment\u20141988 (\u201cRegulation of the exercise of the powers granted is accordingly intended to come through application of the business judgment rule under 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1721 rather than through the doctrine of ultra vires. Cf 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1503.\u201d)\nWith these principles of corporate law in mind, we turn to the NCL, as LEHB is a nonprofit corporation. Just as the BCL grants to for-profit corporations, the NCL provides nonprofit corporations with \u201cthe legal capacity of natural persons to act.\u201d 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5501. Similarly, the NCL gives nonprofit corporations the same general powers as the BCL gives for-profit corporations, using nearly identical language. See 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5502, Source Note\u20141990 (\u201cPatterned after 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1502,\u201d which grants statutory powers to for-profit corporations). For example, nonprofit corporations have the authority to \u201cexercise all of the powers and means appropriate to effect the purpose or purposes for which the corporation is incorporated.\u201d 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5502(a)(18). This language is expansive, not restrictive. Additionally, the NCL gives a nonprofit corporation broad powers, such as the powers \u201c[t]o conduct its business, carry on its operations,\u201d and \u201c[t]o have and exercise all other powers\u201d otherwise vested in the corporation by law, \u201c[sjubject to the limitations and restrictions imposed by statute ... [or] contained in its articles.\u201d 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5502(a)(15), (19). Accordingly, the NCL authorizes all nonprofit corporate actions that are not prohibited by the NCL or the corporation\u2019s articles.\nAlthough the NCL is similar to the BCL in many ways, notably, nonprofit corporations are required by the NCL and its regulations to be incorporated for a specified purpose, as opposed to for-profit corporations, which may be incorporated for \u201cany lawful purpose.\u201d Compare 19 Pa. Code \u00a7 41.4(b) (providing that \u201c[t]he stated purposes of a nonprofit corporation may not consist of solely a statement to the effect that its corporate purpose is to engage in all lawful business\u201d), with 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1502, Committee Comment\u20141988 (\u201cIt is intended further that the corporate purposes of the [for-profit] corporation shall be irrelevant.\u201d). Accordingly, we find that a nonprofit corporation\u2019s actions must be related to its corporate purpose. To hold otherwise would render the requirement that a nonprofit corporation state a corporate purpose other than \u201cany lawful purpose\u201d meaningless.\nHowever, the fact that nonprofit corporations have an additional requirement compared to for-profit corporations does not necessarily mean that we must construe this requirement narrowly. In other words, we do not view this requirement as relegating nonprofit corporations back to the early twentieth century, when every corporation was limited to taking actions which were directly in furtherance of its corporate purpose, which, as set forth above, is a limitation that has since been abandoned. Wells, supra at 585. Instead, we find that this limitation should be broadly interpreted considering the legal principles expounded above. Additionally, the NOL itself indicates that this purpose requirement is not meant to be overly restrictive, as it requires nonprofit corporations to include only a \u201cbrief\u2019 statement of purpose in their articles of incorporation. 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5306(a)(3). The applicable statutory and regulatory provisions contain a non-exhaustive list of broad permissible purposes such as \u201cathletic,\u201d \u201ccharitable,\u201d and \u201ceducational.\u201d See 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5301(a); 19 Pa. Code \u00a7 41.4(a). Moreover, we are guided by the fact that the NCL is patterned after the BCL, and nothing in the NCL or its regulations place an emphasis on the corporate purpose distinction between nonprofit and for-profit corporations. Accordingly, we determine that the purpose statement requirement was not intended to create a marked difference in how nonprofit corporations are to be governed, as opposed to for-profit corporations.\nFor these reasons, we hold that the interplay between a nonprofit corporation\u2019s corporate purpose and that corporation\u2019s authority to take corporate action must be construed in the least restrictive way possible, limiting the amount of court interference and second-guessing, which is reflective of both modern for-profit and not-for-profit corporations, and the modern corporate business laws that govern them. Thus, we find that a nonprofit corporation\u2019s action is authorized when: 1) the action is not prohibited by the NCL or the corporation\u2019s articles; and 2) the action is not clearly unrelated to the corporation\u2019s stated purpose. See 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5502(a)(18) (providing that a nonprofit corporation may \u201cexercise all of the powers and means appropriate to effect the purpose or purposes for which the corporation is incorporated\u201d unless restricted by statute or its articles); 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5306(a)(3) (requiring a nonprofit corporation to list a brief purpose statement in its articles).\nTurning to the facts of the instant case, Zampogna has not pointed us to any language in the NCL or LEHB\u2019s Articles that prohibited LEHB\u2019s action here. As such, LEHB\u2019s action is authorized so long as it is not clearly unrelated to its corporate purpose of administering benefits to its members as set forth in its Articles. Ultimately, we agree -with LEHB that its action was sufficiently related to administering benefits to its members and, therefore, it was authorized.\nThe facts of the instant case exemplify why courts should not act as super-boards second guessing decisions of corporate directors, as courts are \u201cill-equipped\u201d to become \u201cenmeshed in complex corporate decision-making.\u201d Cuker, 692 A.2d at 1046. At first blush, endorsing a candidate in a union election seems unrelated to the administration of medical benefits. However, such a simplistic view of the action at issue here ignores the structure of the CBA between the City and the union and the effect the union president has over LEHB\u2019s revenue source and its very existence. Because the union president has a direct impact on LEHB\u2019s ability to function effectively, endorsing a candidate the corporation believes will better serve its members is not unrelated to its corporate purpose of administering benefits for its members. Accordingly, we conclude that LEHB\u2019s action was sufficiently related to the corporate purpose as set forth in its Articles, rendering the action authorized.\nAs we find that LEHB\u2019s action here was authorized, we need not address the Commonwealth Court\u2019s discussion of LEHB\u2019s alleged conflict of interest, which the court advanced to justify further its decision to reject the LEHB Board\u2019s action. Moreover, we recognize that Zampogna did not present any evidence of a conflict of interest nor did he argue one existed before the trial court or the Commonwealth Court. We agree with LEHB that by failing to introduce any evidence of a conflict of interest, Zampogna failed to meet his burden. Accordingly, the record does not support the Commonwealth Court majority\u2019s determination that the Board\u2019s action here constituted an improper conflict of interest or self-dealing, and we decline to discuss this issue any further.\nTurning to the \u201cpublic funds\u201d issue, we note that Zampogna cites to no authority to support the proposition that the funds at issue here were indeed public funds. To the contrary, we conclude that the originally public funds lost their public character once the City paid them to LEHB in fulfillment of its contractual obligation. Specifically, the City agreed to pay a specific amount of money per police officer to the Joint Trust, not only to pay for the ultimate healthcare benefit that each police officer receives, but also to pay for the administration of those benefits. Once the City paid the specified amount to the Joint Trust pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, it had fulfilled its healthcare benefit obligation, rendering the funds no longer within the City\u2019s control. At that point, the funds were converted from public funds to private moneys in the sole control of LEHB. As such, there was no legal impediment to LEHB\u2019s use of its own private moneys under these circumstances.\nWe note that Zampogna\u2019s challenge to LEHB\u2019s endorsement focused on the mere fact of endorsement, as he did not present any evidence to suggest that the cost of the endorsement was excessive or resulted in any diminution in benefits to LEHB\u2019s members. In other words, Zampogna\u2019s complaint is not one asserting corporate waste. Instead, Zampogna simply argued that the endorsement was unauthorized. Accordingly, our inquiry is limited to whether the endorsement itself was authorized and does not take into consideration the cost of such. Thus, we caution that this decision does not stand for the proposition that LEHB could spend on endorsements unabated, as that issue is not before us.\nFor the reasons set forth above, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed, and the matter is remanded for reinstatement of the trial court\u2019s order dismissing Zampogna\u2019s complaint.\nChief Justice Saylor and Justices Donohue, Dougherty and Mundy join the opinion.\nJustices Todd and Wecht file concurring opinions.\n. Specifically, Section 5301(a) provides:\nExcept as provided in subsection (b) [pertaining to insurance], corporations may be incorporated under this article for any lawful puipose or purposes, including, but not limited to, any one or more of the following or similar purposes: athletic; any lawful business purpose to be conducted on a not-for-profit basis; beneficial; benevolent; cemetery; charitable; civic; control of fire; cultural; educational; encouragement of agriculture or horticulture; fraternal; health; literary; missionary; musical; mutual improvement; patriotic; political; prevention of cruelty to persons or animals; professional, commercial, industrial, trade, service or business associations; promotion of the arts; protection of natural resources; religious; research; scientific and social.\n15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5301(a).\n. The record does not establish the specific content of these statements.\n. The truthfulness and accuracy of the statements are beyond the scope of this Opinion.\n. LEHB also included the same message in its newsletter, at no additional cost.\n. Zampogna also sought injunctive relief. However, the election occurred while the case was pending, rendering such relief moot.\n. Initially, Zampogna appealed to the Superior Court. However, as LEHB is a nonprofit corporation subject to the NCL, the Superior Court transferred this matter to the Commonwealth Court because the case fell within that court\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 762(a)(5) (granting the Commonwealth Court exclusive jurisdiction over appeals involving a nonprofit corporation subject to the NCL).\n. Notably, Section 5502(a) speaks only in terms of limitations and/or restrictions contained in the law or a corporation's articles. See 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5502(a) (providing that a nonprofit corporation has broad powers \"[sjubject to the limitations and restrictions imposed by statute ... [or] contained in its articles\u201d). However, 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5503, the section immediately following Section 5502, refers to a \"limitation upon the business, purposes or powers of a nonprofit corporation, expressed or implied in its articles or bylaws or implied by law,\u201d indicating that a restriction on the corporation could be contained in either the articles or the bylaws. Because there is no purported restriction in LEHB\u2019s Bylaws on the action taken here, and as our analysis revolves around Section 5502 and not Section 5503, we will not discuss LEHB\u2019s Bylaws any further.\n. Specifically, we granted to review the following issues:\n(a) Whether Courts may disregard the vital function of corporate self-governance by second-guessing the decisions of corporate directors and failing to provide the required deference to their decision simply because the court may not agree with the decision?\n(b) Whether a court may simply usurp the role of corporate directors by negating the presumption of good-faith to the decisions of directors required by law by simply asserting, without requiring any proof thereof, a conflict of interest by the directors?\n(c) Whether funds, whose original source was a public entity, retain their public character once the public entity distributes those funds to a private corporation in satisfaction of an obligation, and after the private corporation had retained those funds as corporate assets, and after that corporation utilized the corporate assets for a corporate purpose?\nZampogna v. Law Enforcement Health Benefits, Inc., 627 Pa. 252, 99 A.3d 531 (2014) (order).\n. The Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission filed an amicus curiae brief in this matter, without indicating support for either party. Therein, it described that it is involved in monitoring ratepayer funds which it deems to be \"public funds\u201d and which have been deposited into four sustainable energy funds in order to ensure that such funds are being used to promote: \"(1) the development and use of renewable energy and clean energy technologies; (2) energy conservation and efficiency; and (3) renewable business initiatives and projects that improve the environment in the companies\u2019 electric service territories.\u201d Amicus brief at 5-6. Amicus urges this Court not to issue a decision which would adversely affect its continued audit authority over the funds and its ability to compel compliance with the foregoing public purposes.\n. Our overview begins with the BCL, which in its current form governs only for-profit corporations. However, at the time of its original enactment in 1933, there was no separate statute governing nonprofit corporations. It was not until 1972 that Pennsylvania enacted the NCL, which provides specific provisions for nonprofit corporations. Accordingly, we find the history underlying the BCL is relevant to framing our discussion of the NCL. More importantly, the section of the NCL governing nonprofit corporate powers indicates it was patterned after the BCL, as discussed in more detail infra. See 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5502, Source Note\u20141990 (\"Patterned after 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1502,\u201d which grants statutory powers to for-profit corporations).\n. Whether the business judgment rule would apply in this case is irrelevant to our holding, as we ultimately conclude that the action here was sufficiently related without giving deference to the Board's decision, Thus, we discuss this rule merely to establish generally the level of appropriate court involvement in corporate decisions, which informs our view of how the NCL should be interpreted.\n. The only difference is that for-profit corporations have an additional power relating to acquisitions and take-overs, which are not relevant to nonprofits,\n. Because we conclude that the funds at issue were private, we do not speak to whether public funds may be used to endorse candidates in a private, union election."}
