{"id": "488654", "contents": "The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered,\nPer Curiam.\nIt has been uniformly held by this court that a mechanic\u2019s lien to bind the estate of a married woman must show on its face every requisite to make it a valid claim against her. In Kuhns and Wife v. Turney, 6 Norris 497, our brother Gordon, after an exhaustive review of the cases, says, in the opinion of the court delivered by him : \u201c It follows that if a mechanic or material-man would successfully charge the estate of a feme covert for work and labor done, or materials furnished, he must not only prove on the trial, but also set forth in his claim filed, .that such work or material was necessary for the improvement or repair, as the ca\u00a7e may be, of her separate estate.\u201d In this respect the lien filed in this case was defective, and the court below therefore were right in striking it from the record.\nJudgment affirmed."}
