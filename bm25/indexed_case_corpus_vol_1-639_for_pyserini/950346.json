{"id": "950346", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nThe second and third assignments of error are to the court\u2019s sustaining the commonwealth\u2019s challenges for cause to jurors who had conscientious scruples against capital punishment. It has long been settled that such scruples are a good cause for challenge: Com. v. Lesher, 17 S. & B. 155; and it is equally well settled that the test of such scruples as a disqualification is the juror\u2019s own testimony as to his ability to throw aside their influence and render a verdict according to the evidence alone: Com. v. Valsalka, 181 Pa. 17 (34).\nThe same test is applicable to the disqualification by a preconceived opinion of the juror as to the guilt or innocence of the prisoner, which is the ground of the fourth assignment: Com. v. Taylor, 129 Pa. 534, and cases there cited.\nBut this test, while in the nature of things the only one available, is not to be applied solely on the juror\u2019s own conclusion. He may honestly think he can disregard his scruples or his opinion, and may honestly try to do so; but his ability as well as his willingness must be shown to the satisfaction of the judge, and the latter must be allowed a large measure of discretion. \u201cWe cannot bring before us the tones, the manner and apparent spirit and character of this juror, and for that reason we cannot review the influence such considerations exercised upon the mind of the learned judge : \u201d Com. v. Roddy, 184 Pa. 274. \u201c The established test is ^whether or not the juror can throw aside his impression or opinion and render an impartial verdict on the evidence alone. That question the juror alone can answer, and the weight of his answer is not to be determined exclusively by his words as they appear in print in the record, but by his words, manner and bearing, as to which a fair measure of discretion must be allowed to the court below which had the juror before it: \u201d Com. v. Eagan, 190 Pa. 10.\nIn the present case the two jurors who had conscientious scruples against capital punishment each testified that he would bring in a verdict according to the evidence, but it \u201c would worry his conscience \u201d or \u201c would do violence to his conscience.\u201d The judge might very fairly doubt if the jurors had the ability to be entirely impartial though they might honestly make the effort. But even if he had no such doubt he was right in holding that the law did not compel him to subject a juror to such a strain on his conscience. It was a proper exercise of his discretion.\nBut even if the discretion had been improvidently exercised the prisoner would not have been injured, for he had no right to the service of any particular juror on his panel, and if he had a legal and impartial jury this was all he was entitled to : Com. v. Mosier, 185 Pa. 221, and cases collected in Thompson and Merriam on Juries, secs. 159, 251 and 271.\nOn the point made in the fourth assignment that the juror testified that he had a \u201c fixed opinion,\u201d the case of Curley v. Com., 84 Pa. 151, is express authority that notwithstanding the juror\u2019s use of the term \u201c fixed opinion \u201d he was not disqualified if he still declared he could disregard it and be governed by the evidence alone.\nThe other assignments do not require any detailed discussion.\nThe amendment of the record of the first trial was justified by the minute book and merely conformed the record to the verdict as it was actually rendered.\nWe have constantly to remind counsel that where the judge in his charge reviewing the evidence omits or insufficiently refers to portions that counsel think material, it is their duty to call the judge\u2019s attention to them before the case goes to the jury, so that the error, if there is one, may be corrected before it has done any harm.\nThe judgment is affirmed and the record is remitted to the court that execution may be had according to law."}
