{"id": "1742187", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant Robert Adams was indicted under the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 3921 (\u201cTheft by unlawful taking or disposition\u201d) and 3925 (\u201cReceiving stolen property\u201d) for theft of an automobile. A court sitting without jury convicted appellant of violating section 3921. Upon appellant\u2019s request for a disposition under section 3925, the court acquitted him thereunder solely because it believed appellant could not be convicted under both sections. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to three years probation. The Superior Court affirmed without opinion (Hoffman, J., joined by Spaeth, J., concurring). We granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nAppellant contends that the evidence\u2019is insufficient to sustain his conviction because there is no evidence that he stole the automobile. We agree with the trial court that one who exercises unlawful control over moveable property of another may be convicted of theft under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3921, even without evidence that he originally misappropriated the property. We therefore affirm.\nAround June 19, 1974, an automobile valued at $3500 was stolen from the complainant. Two days later, he and a friend saw appellant standing next to the stolen car. The friend approached appellant, who, after starting the engine, offered to sell the car for $100. The police were called and arrested appellant.\nThe issue appellant raises is one of the first impression in this jurisdiction. Section 3921(a) provides that\n\u201cA person is guilty of theft if he unlawfully takes, or exercises unlawful control over, moveable property of another with intent to deprive him thereof.\u201d\nWe believe that appellant \u201cexercise[d] unlawful control over\u201d the automobile of complainant when he got in the car, started the engine, and offered to sell the car to complainant\u2019s friend. This conclusion accords the language of the statute its ordinary meaning. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1903 (plain meaning rule); accord, Commonwealth v. Harmon, 469 Pa. 490, 366 A.2d 895 (1976).\nOther states with current statutory provisions resembling Pennsylvania\u2019s have rejected appellant\u2019s argument. Illinois, like Pennsylvania, based its new theft statutes upon the. Model Penal Code, Tentative Draft No. 2, art. 206 and the Official Draft, art. 223. Under a provision forbidding \u201c[o]btain[ing] or exertpng] unauthorized control over the property [of another],\u201d Illinois allows conviction even when there is no proof that a defendant originally misappropriated the property. E. g., People v. Dziak, 30 Ill.App.3d 859, 333 N.E.2d 582 (1975) (mem.); People v. Helm, 10 Ill.App.3d 643, 295 N.E.2d 78 (1973); People v. Nunn, 63 Ill.App.2d 465, 212 N.E.2d 342 (1965). Accord, State v. Huot, 170 Conn. 463, 464, 365 A.2d 1144, 1146 (1976) (statute more explicit than Pennsylvania\u2019s). Citing a Virginia decision, the West Virginia court early stated the rule that\n\u201cif [one] is indicted for a simple larceny and upon the trial it appears that he did not actually steal the property but did receive it with knowledge of the theft, he is nevertheless guilty of the larceny and amenable to the same penalties. Price v. Com., 21 Grat. [62 Va.] 846; State v. Halida, 28 W.Va. 499.\u201d\nState v. Goldstrohm, 84 W.Va. 129, 131, 99 S.E. 248 (1919).\nAppellant presents two reasons why we should require evidence of taking under section 3921. We find neither persuasive. First, he notes that the comments to the Model Penal Code analogue to section 3921 state that \u201c \u2018exercise\u2019 of unauthorized control is the requirement in the typical embezzlement situation where the actor already has lawful control\u201d of property. Model Penal Code, Tent. Draft No. 2, \u00a7 206.1, comment 3. He concludes that we should require some evidence showing the accused misappropriated the automobile before the accused may be convicted under section 3921. However, the comment also states that the description \u201cTaking or Exercise of Unlawful Control . replaces . . . \u2018caption\u2019 and \u2018asportation\u2019 as well as a great variety of current legislative terms such as steal, take, remove, carry away, receive, secrete, conceal, withhold, retain, fail or refuse to pay, appropriate, convert, embezzle, misapply, sell, convey, transfer, dispose, pledge, use.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). Thus, the drafters of the Model Penal Code intended that the Code\u2019s analogue to section 3921 prohibit at least such acts of unlawful control over property as receipt, use and sale, as well as its original misappropriation. We thus find nothing in the comments to persuade us that the Legislature did not intend section 3921 to proscribe appellant\u2019s conduct.\nAppellant also argues that to hold him liable under section 3921 would make a nullity of section 3925, prohibiting receiving, retaining, or disposing stolen goods, because section 3925 would prohibit every act covered by section 3921. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a) (\u201cEvery statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions\u201d). To the contrary, our construction of section 3921 accords independent scope to section 3925. Section 3903(a) imposes an enhanced penalty for conviction of theft by receiving stolen property (section 3925) in certain cases where the receiver is in the business of buying or selling stolen property.\nFor these reasons, we believe that the court of common pleas properly interpreted 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3921. Under this construction there was sufficient evidence to convict appellant.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nMANDER.INO, J., concurs in the result.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which POMEROY, J., joined.\n. Appellant was also indicted under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3928 (\u201cUnauthorized use of [a motor vehicle]\u201d), but the court sustained a demurrer to this charge.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 32, 1970, P.L. 673, \u00a7 204, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.204 (Supp. 1977).\n. The Model Penal Code uses \u201cunauthorized\u201d where the Pennsylvania statute has \u201cunlawful.\u201d\n. To the extent that conduct formerly proscribed by receiving stolen goods statutes are now proscribed by section 3921 as well, the comments to the Model Penal Code notes that such assimilation is proper: \u201cAnalytically, the receiver does precisely what is forbidden by [the MPC analogue of section 3921], namely, he exercises unauthorized control over property of another with the purpose of applying or disposing of it permanently for the benefit of himself or another not entitled.\u201d Model Penal Code, Tent. Draft No. 2, \u00a7 206.8, comment 1.\n. Appellant presents two other issues. He asserts that the trial court could not render inconsistent verdicts by convicting him of theft of an automobile while sustaining a demurrer to a charge of unauthorized use of the same vehicle. Appellant did not raise this issue in post-verdict motions, and it therefore has not been preserved for appellate review. Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975). He also contends that his jury waiver colloquy was defective. This contention is without merit."}
