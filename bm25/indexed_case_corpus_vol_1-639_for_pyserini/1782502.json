{"id": "1782502", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM.\nThis is a direct appeal from Pike County Common Pleas\u2019 judgments of sentence of life imprisonment for second degree murder, 10 to 20 years for robbery to be served consecutively to the life sentence, and 2% to 5. years for unlawfully carrying a firearm to be served consecutively to the murder and robbery sentences. Four issues are raised: (1) the illegality of appellant\u2019s arrest and the failure to suppress the fruits of that arrest; (2) failure to suppress appellant\u2019s inculpatory statements as involuntary; (3) failure to comply with the six-hour rule for arraignment after arrest enunciated in Commonwealth v. Davenport, 471 Pa. 278, 370 A.2d 301 (1977) and the failure to suppress those statements taken after arrest; and (4) failure of the sentencing court to comply with the sentencing code. We have reviewed the record in this case and find appellant\u2019s contentions to be without merit.\nJudgments of sentence affirmed."}
