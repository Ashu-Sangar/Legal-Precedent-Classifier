The writ awarded by the court below will, therefore, be vacated and set aside and the proceeding dismissed for want of jurisdiction of the subject matter (see Hopkins v. Great Western Fuse Company, 343 Pa. 438, 440, 22 A. 2d 717; also Business Corporation Law of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, Section 1001, 15 P. S. \u00a72852-1001) at the plaintiffs\u2019 costs.\nSo ordered."}
