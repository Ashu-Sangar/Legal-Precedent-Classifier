The weather was sleeting; there was no evidence of inadequate lighting, defect ip the box, or that it stood on ground that was not level. A brakeman stood on one side of the box and a chauffeur, who had come to receive plaintiff, stood on the other, the chauffeur helping her down by having, as she testified, \u201chis hand on my elbow\u201d; she thought the box \u201ctipped\u201d or \u201cslipped bach on the sleet\u201d. The learned court below concluded there was no. evidence of negligence on the part of defendant; nothing to show that the box was misplaced or was defective, or that the injury resulted from an appliance of transportation. We agree with that conclusion. Compare Dixon v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 98 Pa. Superior Ct. 557.\nJudgment affirmed."}
