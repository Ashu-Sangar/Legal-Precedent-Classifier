{"id": "1249605", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Chidsey,\nThis action of trespass was instituted by Carl Van Bur\u00e9n, the father of the minor plaintiff, in his own right and as guardian for the minor, Bruce VanBuren, his four year old son, for injuries to the child, who was struck by an automobile operated by one of the defendants. The motor vehicle was owned by Lewis Eberhard, one of the defendants, but was not being driven by him. Since no agency relationship was established between Eberhard and the other defendants, a directed verdict was returned in his favor, which is not questioned by the plaintiffs. The liability of the other defendants, George Cole, William Grubbs and Albert Volker, who were partners trading as Manheim Body Repair, was submitted to the jury and they returned a verdict in favor of the minor plaintiff for $12,500 and for the father in the sum of $7,500. The defendants moved for judgment non obstante veredicto and for a new trial, both of which motions were denied. From the judgments entered on the verdicts, following the dismissal of the motions the present appeal is taken.\nThe sole question posed by the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment n.o.v. is whether there was sufficient evidence of defendants\u2019 negligence to submit to the jury. Since the minor plaintiff was only four years of age, he could not be charged with contributory negligence.\nWe necessarily turn, therefore, to the facts, mindful of the requirement that we must read the testimony and all inferences reasonably deducible therefrom in a light most advantageous to the plaintiffs and resolve all conflicts in their favor. So viewed, the following facts appear: George Cole, one of the defendants, was driving a 1949 Hudson sedan which his partners had just repaired. The car was to be delivered to the Roxy Motors Company, located in the German-town section of Philadelphia, for additional repairs, sometime around noon. The accident occurred at 4:45 P.M. Defendant Cole admitted that somehow he had become lost and in tbe process of finding Ms way, turned off the main streets and found himself on Newhall Lane, an improved street which does not exist on the city plan, but which, nevertheless, is open to public use. Newhall Lane is 18 feet wide and has no sidewalks. It runs north and south through a low-cost public housing project from Price Street on the south to Rittenhouse Street on the north, a distance described in the record as about three-quarters of a block.\nThe weather was clear and the road surface was dry. Defendant Cole testified that except for an automobile parked on the east side as he first entered Newhall Lane, there was nothing to obstruct his view as he proceeded northwardly in the center of the street. He admitted seeing two signs on the east side of the street which read \u201cCaution \u2014 Children at Play\u201d and \u201cSpeed Limit 15 Miles\u201d respectively.\nOne of the plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses, Sybil Huffman, testified that on the day of the accident she was returning from shopping to her apartment in the housing project. She stated that before entering her apartment she observed a group of 10 or 12 children playing in the street and on the curb near the third tree south of Rittenhouse Street (which is approximately in the middle of the block on the east side). She said that she entered her apartment, and, after opening her window to deposit some trash on a ledge, she saw a body (later identified to be the minor plaintiff) flying through the air for a distance of approximately 30 feet; that immediately behind the body, traveling-in the same direction, she saw the automobile operated by defendant Cole. The body was thrown in a northwardly direction and after it landed, rolled about 6 feet toward the east curb. When the automobile stopped, the back portion thereof was at a point 42 feet beyond the point where the body came to rest. Mrs. Buffman estimated that about one minute elapsed between the time she saw the children playing and the time she saw the body propelled through the air.\nMrs. Kelbaugh, another witness for the plaintiff, testified that immediately after the accident there were children playing in the vicinity of the third tree south of Rittenhouse Street, and, further, at the time the automobile came to a stop she could hear children playing in that general direction.\nThe defendants, relying on the case of Foley, Executrix v. The Pittsburgh-Des Moines Company et al., 363 Pa. 1, 24, 25, 68 A. 2d 517, contend that since the circumstances surrounding the accident did not eliminate a cause resulting in non-liability and fairly suggested by the evidence, namely, that the boy darted into the road without affording the driver a chance to sea and avoid him, the jury was therefore allowed to speculate about the cause. In the Foley case we held \u201c. . . that where an injury may be the result of one of several causes for only one of which defendant is liable, the burden is on the plaintiff to individuate that one as the proximate cause of his injury and to exclude other causes fairly suggested by the evidence to which it would be equally reasonable to attribute the injury: . . .\u201d, citing Lott v. Peoples Natural Gas Co., 324 Pa. 517, 188 A. 582. Even considering this language divorced from its surrounding context, we fail to see where any evidence adduced by the defendants would sufficiently suggest that the accident was caused by the child\u2019s suddenly running into the side of the car. At most an issue of fact was raised for the jury\u2019s consideration. The fact that parts of the child\u2019s skin and hair were found about three feet from the east side of the roadway does not establish that he was bumped by the right side of the car. The same result could have followed a front end collision.\nAgainst the defendant Cole\u2019s testimony that the boy must have run into the side of the automobile since he heard a bump on the side of the car, we have one of plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses testifying that she saw him hurled 30 feet forward of the car. When the Foley case is read in its entirety it becomes even more apparent that the question of defendants\u2019 negligence was for the jury. Immediately after the extracted quotation we said, \u201c. . . But on the other hand, where the evidence points to a certain cause which would make the defendant liable the plaintiff will not be denied redress merely because there may be some other possible cause for the accident; in such a case the question is for the jury: . . .\u201d.\nThis Court has consistently held that where there is reason to apprehend that children might run into a place of danger there is a duty imposed on an operator of an automobile to have his car under such control that it can be stopped on the shortest possible notice of danger: Buchanan et al. v. Belusko et al., 361 Pa. 465, 467, 65 A. 2d 386; Chapple et al. v. Sellers, 365 Pa. 503, 506, 76 A. 2d 172; Wilson v. Butler Motor Transit Company, 368 Pa. 479, 481, 84 A. 2d 207. When we consider that there was affirmative testimony that children were playing in the vicinity of the \u201cthird tree\u201d immediately prior and subsequent to the accident, that defendant had knowledge of the posted warning signs, and that he admittedly had an unobstructed view, we believe there was sufficient testimony to justify the jury in concluding that defendant was inattentive and failed to observe what was before his eyes until it was too late to avoid the accident.\nIn support of their contention that they are entitled to a new trial, appellants claim that the trial judge erred (1) in permitting the recall of plaintiffs\u2019 principal witness after the close of plaintiffs\u2019 case and (2) in his interrogation of the jurors with respect to the items included in their award of damages after they rendered a verdict improper in form.\n(1) After the plaintiffs had closed their case and a motion for compulsory nonsuit had been argued by defendants\u2019 counsel, plaintiffs were permitted over defendants\u2019 objection to recall their principal witness, Mrs. Buff man, to amplify her testimony by stating in what direction the minor\u2019s body had been propelled when she saw it \u201cflying through the air\u201d, the point where she first observed it in flight and the point where it landed. Her testimony in chief lacked clarity, was somewhat confusing in this regard and she at no time testified as to the direction of the body in flight.\nThe witness\u2019 testimony on recall was not contradictory of her previous testimony. Some repetition which occurred was practically unavoidable but it was minimal and largely produced by defendants\u2019 cross-examination.\nAllowing a party to recall a witness to introduce further testimony is within the sound discretion of the court and we will reverse only for a clear abuse of discretion: D. L. Stern, Trustee v. William Stanton, Ellen I. Stanton and Joseph Weber, 184 Pa. 468, 478, 39 A. 404. In Wiser v. Parkway Baking Co., 289 Pa. 565, 568, 137 A. 797, this Court said: \u201c. . . Courts are and in general should be liberal in permitting the recall of witnesses to correct mistakes or oversights in the testimony. . . .\u201d.\nIt is true that in the present case the witness was permitted to testify after plaintiffs had closed their case and defendants had argued in support of a non-suit, but the general rule that the matter is one for the court\u2019s discretion, is not limited in its application to any particular .stage of the trial. Of. course, the presentation of evidence after argument affords opportunIty for the coloring or manufacture of testimony to supply deficiencies revealed by opposing counsel\u2019s argument, and its introduction must be most carefully and cautiously considered by the court. If, however, an honest purpose will be justly served, without unfair disadvantage, it is within the court\u2019s discretion to admit the evidence. See Vol. VI, Wigmore on Evidence, (Third Edition), \u00a7\u00a71876-1878. We can not say that the trial judge in the present case was guilty of a palpable abuse of discretion in permitting the introduction of Mrs. Buffman\u2019s testimony on recall.\n(2) After the trial judge had correctly and adequately instructed the jury on the law and the damages to which the plaintiffs were entitled in the event the issue of liability was resolved in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, the record disclosed the following rendition of verdicts: \u201cForeman: Verdict for Defendant Eberhard. Verdict for the plaintiff Carl VanBuren and award him $1,000 to cover all medical expenses to date; and also $300 per year until Bruce is 21 years of age, to be placed in trust for future medieal expenses; an additional $2,500 to be used at the discretion of Carl VanBuren to meet future contingencies until Bruce attains the age of 21. We find in favor of the plaintiff Bruce Van Bur\u00e9n and award him the sum of $5,000 to be placed in trust until he attains the age of 21, to supplement future loss of earnings.\u201d. The trial judge, realizing that the verdict was defective on several grounds, refused to have it recorded and thereupon questioned the jury about the items they had included in the verdict. This provoked a lengthy colloquy participated in by the judge, counsel and individual jurors which covers 8 pages of the printed record. During its course the judge initially asked the jury whether they had taken into account at all the item of pain and suffering, to which one juror replied, \u201cWe discussed it.\u201d. The judge then said,' \u201cThat is already included? Very well.\u201d. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel thereupon stated to the court that he did not believe pain and suffering was included. The judge responded, \u201c1 do not know; I asked that question.\u201d. Further comment on this element of damages at that point would seem to have been uncalled for but the judge repeated his instructions to the jury covering this phase of the law as to the damages recoverable, and the jury again retired.\nUpon exception by defendants\u2019 counsel to this additional charge, the judge, in order to clarify the matter and remove all doubt, recalled the jury and asked them if pain and suffering had been included in their award, and this time the jury answered in the negative. They retired for the third time and then rendered a verdict in favor of the minor plaintiff for $12,500 and for the father in the amount of $7,500.\nThe action of a trial judge in the correction of verdicts should be taken with great caution and with avoidance of any influence upon the deliberations of the jury as to matters exclusively within their province. We think the learned and experienced judge in the present case conscientiously endeavored to conform with this rule but, in our opinion, the course and extent of the colloquy with respect to the award of damages inevitably had a prejudicial effect upon the defendants. Pain and suffering as an item of damage which was referred to by the court seven times during the prolonged discussion, became unduly emphasized. We are not satisfied that either of the verdicts finally rendered was properly arrived at, and we are therefore constrained to direct a new trial.\nThe judgments in favor of the appellees are reversed and a new trial granted.\nReporter\u2019s Note: Amended by order of April 5, 1954, reported, infra, p. 34."}
