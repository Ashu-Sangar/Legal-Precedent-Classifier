{"id": "1775303", "contents": "OPINION\nMcDERMOTT, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from the order of the Commonwealth Court denying appellant\u2019s petition to open a default judgment entered against him by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (\u201cPennDOT\u201d). The sole issue presented is whether appellant established in the Commonwealth Court a sufficient basis to require the opening of the default judgment. We conclude that such a basis was established and, accordingly, reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.\nAppellant Robert Nemeth, owner of a commercial janitorial service company in Luzerne County, placed a bid with PennDOT in late 1977 to perform janitorial and maintenance work at two highway rest areas. Appellant was the low bidder on this project, and on January 15,1978 appellant and PennDOT entered into a written contract in which appellant agreed to maintain the rest areas for a one year period in exchange for a lump sum payment from PennDOT not to exceed $73,000.00. The contract included the following provision:\n13. LIABILITY\n* * * * * *\nE. Surety Bonds. The successful bidder will be required upon award of contract, to furnish PennDOT with an appropriate specific project or blanket Performance Bond and Payment Bond, with surety satisfactory to the Commonwealth. . . . Within ten days from the bid opening, the successful bidder is required to submit a letter of guarantee that he will be bonded for the total amount.\nAppellant provided PennDOT with a letter dated December 13, 1977, from Hazelton Insurance Center, Inc. (\u201cHazel-ton\u201d), notifying PennDOT that the required bond had been authorized and was being prepared. After PennDOT and appellant had concluded their maintenance agreement, Hazelton informed appellant that no bond would be issued. PennDOT then cancelled its contract with appellant, awarded a contract to the next lowest bidder, and on October 10, 1978, brought an action against appellant for the difference between appellant\u2019s bid and the next lowest bid.\nUpon receiving PennDOT\u2019s complaint, appellant sought the legal counsel of Thomas J. Sharkey, Esquire. Mr. Sharkey notified PennDOT that he was representing appellant and requested an extension of the time within which he could file an answer on appellant\u2019s behalf. On October 31, 1978 PennDOT agreed to grant a twenty-day extension of the time for filing an answer.\nNothing further occurred in this case until June 26, 1979 when PennDOT obtained a default judgment against appellant. On July 6, 1979 appellant filed a petition to open the judgment, alleging that: (1) appellant had failed to file an answer to the complaint because of confusion surrounding the dissolution of Mr. Sharkey\u2019s law firm; and (2) appellant had a meritorious defense to the judgment because the required bond had been promised by Hazelton.\nFollowing argument and some testimony concerning the petition in Commonwealth Court, on August 10, 1979 the Honorable John A. MacPhail entered an order denying the petition. In a subsequent memorandum opinion Judge MacPhail held that appellant\u2019s explanation for the default was insufficient and that no meritorious defense had been established.\nIt is well-settled in this Commonwealth that, in order to open a default judgment, the moving party must show that (1) the petition to open was filed promptly, (2) the failure to act on the original complaint can be reasonably explained, and (3) a meritorious defense to the underlying claim exists. Kennedy v. Frank F. Black, Jr. Inc., 492 Pa. 397, 424 A.2d 1250 (1981); Ruczynski v. Jesray Construction Corp., 457 Pa. 510, 326 A.2d 326 (1974). We conclude that appellant has satisfied each of these criteria.\nThere can be no doubt that appellant\u2019s petition to open was promptly filed after entry of the judgment by default. The judgment was entered against appellant on June 26, 1979; he filed a petition to open on July 6, 1979.\nLess easily resolved is the issue of whether appellant\u2019s seven month delay in acting on the original complaint can be reasonably excused. The record indicates that appellant turned the case over to his attorney, Mr. Sharkey, immediately after receiving the complaint. Mr. Sharkey then obtained an extension of time for filing an answer. At the hearing held on the petition to open, Mr. Sharkey stated that when the complaint was filed, the eight-attorney firm of which he was a member was in the process of splitting into several smaller firms and that rigorous negotiations on the parent firm\u2019s dissolution were continuing. Mr. Sharkey said that he transferred the case to a member of his present firm and was subsequently unaware that no answer had been filed. He apparently made no effort to follow the progress of the case after assigning it to the second attorney.\nBy the stipulation of facts submitted to the trial court and by his statements at the hearing, Mr. Sharkey admitted a less than careful and prudent concern for his client\u2019s affairs. Any person entrusting a matter to an attorney in this Commonwealth should be able to believe that the matter will be competently and diligently handled. As we stated when faced with a similar situation in Stephens v. Bartholomew, 422 Pa. 311, 312-313, 220 A.2d 617, 618 (1966), however, it would be \u201ca shame to impose a large liability upon [appellant] because of the inexcusable neglect of his attorney, especially when [appellee] will not be prejudiced if he has a meritorious claim.\u201d\n\u201cErrors of counsel.. ., which indicate an oversight rather than a deliberate decision not to defend, have been held to constitute sufficient legal justification to open a default judgment.\u201d Johnson v. Yellow Cab Co., 226 Pa.Super. 270, 272, 307 A.2d 423, 424 (1973) (new counsel incorrectly assumed that responsive pleading had been filed); Stephens v. Bartholomew, 422 Pa. 311, 220 A.2d 617 (counsel failed to read complaint in time to file answer due to other business commitments); Balk v. Ford Motor Co., 446 Pa. 137, 285 A.2d 128 (1971) (insurance carrier lost moving party\u2019s court papers); Fox v. Mellon, 438 Pa. 364, 264 A.2d 623 (1970) (insurance claims manager erroneously assumed that there was time remaining in which to respond to complaint).\nWe conclude that appellant\u2019s attorney\u2019s neglect of his client\u2019s affairs provides sufficient justification for appellant\u2019s failure to respond to the original complaint. Our conclusion is bolstered in the instant case by the fact the record reveals no negotiations nor any attempt by PennDOT to draw the attention of appellant\u2019s counsel to the case or to warn of a possible default judgment. Moreover, there is no evidence whatsoever of any deliberate dilatory tactics on the part of appellant or his counsel. See Balk v. Ford Motor Co., 446 Pa. at 141, 285 A.2d at 131 (1971).\nAs his defense, appellant asserts that, if PennDOT has a valid claim, Hazelton Insurance Center is liable. Appellant reasons that, because bonding was a condition precedent to the contract, no contract would have been made between PennDOT and appellant if Hazelton had not promised to furnish the bond. Both parties relied on Hazelton\u2019s promise that the bond was forthcoming. We hold that appellant has made out a defense on the merits sufficient to require that the default judgment be opened.\nAccordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nHUTCHINSON, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, as amended, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 723.\n. The record discloses no contact whatsoever between the opposing parties following the letter granting a 20-day extension until the default judgment was entered.\n. The parties stipulated to the foregoing facts as if \u201cthey had been proven at hearing\u201d in this matter.\n. See also, Toplovich v. Spitman, 239 Pa.Super. 327, 330, 361 A.2d 425, 426 (1976) (\u201cAppellant\u2019s position should not be prejudiced by attorney carelessness to observe professional standards.\u201d); Campbell v. Heilman Homes, Inc., 233 Pa.Super. 366, 335 A.2d 371 (1975) (defending party\u2019s employee failed to forward complaint to main office); Samuel Jacobs Distributors, Inc. v. Conditioned Air, Inc., 223 Pa.Super. 466, 301 A.2d 907 (1973) (attorney mistakenly concluded that client had not been properly served).\n. The default judgment in this case was entered before the effective date of Pa.R.C.P. 237.1, which requires notice to the defendant and his counsel before entry of a default judgment. This new rule should obviate many of the current problems in this Commonwealth concerning default judgments. If Rule 237.1 had been in effect prior to taking of the instant default judgment, this matter very probably would not be before us.\n. The record does not clarify the circumstances of PennDOT\u2019s cancellation of the contract, e.g., whether appellant was permitted an opportunity to obtain the required bonds from a surety other than Hazelton.\n. Appellant apparently complied with the requirement of paragraph 13 of the contract that he supply a letter guaranteeing that he would be bonded for the total amount."}
