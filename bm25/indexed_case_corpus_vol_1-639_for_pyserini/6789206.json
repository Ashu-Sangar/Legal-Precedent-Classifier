{"id": "6789206", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice STEVENS.\nIn response to the pressing time demands of this primary election appeal, we entered a per curiam order on an expedited basis vacating the order of the Commonwealth Court and directing that Appellee Michael W. Beyer\u2019s name be stricken from the primary ballot for the Democratic Party nomination for the Office of Representative in the General Assembly for the 131st Legislative District. See In re Nomination Petition of Beyer, 625 Pa. 341, 91 A.3d 1231 (2014). In the per curiam order, we stated that an opinion would follow, and we now augment the brief explanation appearing in our original mandate.\nThe Election Code, 25 P.S. \u00a7 2600 et seq., vests discretion in courts to amend a material defect apparent on the face of nomination petitions unless the defect manifests the candidate\u2019s intent to mislead electors. See In re Nomination Petitions of McIntyre, 778 A.2d 746, 751 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001) aff'd sub nom. In re McIntyre, 564 Pa. 670, 770 A.2d 326 (2001) (holding wrongful intent precludes amendment). Here, Mr. Beyer circulated nomination petitions listing his present occupation as \u201clawyer\u201d when he was a law school graduate neither authorized to practice law in any jurisdiction nor working with the law in any capacity. Deeming his description of occupation both materially defective and issued with the knowledge it could mislead electors as to his credentials for the office of lawmaker, we held the defect ineligible for amendment and precluded Mr. Beyer\u2019s access to the ballot.\nThe record reveals that Michael W. Beyer timely filed nomination petitions with the Department of State seeking placement of his name on the ballot for Democratic Nomination for the Office of Representative in the General Assembly for the 131st Legislative District. Appellant Objectors, qualified electors residing in the 131st Legislative District, filed in the Commonwealth Court a petition to set aside the nomination petition on grounds that Mr. Beyer intentionally misrepresented his occupation as \u201clawyer\u201d on both his Statement of Financial Interests (SOFI) and nomination petitions.\nJudge Ren\u00e9e Cohn Jubelirer presided over the matter and conducted a hearing on April 11, 2014. At the hearing, Mr. Beyer confirmed he had graduated law school in May of 2013 but had yet to pass or even take any state\u2019s bar examination. Consequently, he was not licensed to practice law at the time he circulated his nomination petitions. He listed his occupation as \u201clawyer,\u201d he said, because he understood the definition of \u201clawyer\u201d as found in the Oxford English Dictionary to include someone who studied the law. In addition, Mr. Beyer believed \u201coccupation\u201d meant \u201cprofession,\u201d and because he understood \u201clawyer\u2019 to mean someone who studies the law, he considers his profession to be that of a lawyer.\u201d In re Nomination of Beyer, (Pa.Cmwlth., 150 M.D.2014, filed April 17, 2014) at 3. He therefore thought it fair comment to describe his profession or occupation as \u201clawyer\u201d on his nomination petition.\nMr. Beyer testified that he never meant to imply he was a licensed, practicing lawyer, and he thus denied possessing the intent to deceive the electorate with his statement of occupation. In support of this testimony, Mr. Beyer alluded to a newspaper article that reported he was a law school graduate without suggesting he was licensed or practicing. In no personal dealing did he claim licensure or any other eligibility to practice law or represent clients in Pennsylvania, Mr. Beyer further testified. When electors asked him about his listed occupation, Mr. Beyer elaborated appropriately, he contended.\nDrawing extensively from the rationale employed in a single-judge Commonwealth Court decision in In re Nomination Petition of Guzzardi (Pa.Cmwlth., No. 158 M.D.2014, filed April 15, 2014), a decision we subsequently reversed on unrelated grounds, see infra, the Honorable Ren\u00e9e Cohn Jubelirer determined that Mr. Beyer\u2019s statement of occupation did not amount to a defect on the face of the petition. The term \u201clawyer,\u201d she held, fairly includes those learned in the law though not licensed to practice the law, and the term \u201coccupation\u201d includes \u201cone\u2019s profession, particularly one that requires extensive training, regardless of whether one is actually active in that profession.\u201d Beyer, 150 M.D.2014 at 3 (quoting Guzzardi, supra at 22).\nJudge Cohn Jubelirer further opined that even if the statement of occupation were a misrepresentation, the resultant defect was not material to the nomination process because \u201c[c]andidate credibly testified that he had no intention to deceive the electorate.\u201d Id. at 12. Though she found that he likely used the title of \u201clawyer\u201d to \u201cenhance his stature with the electorate,\u201d she accepted his explanation that he believed his having studied law and graduated law school in the past, alone, entitled him to claim the occupation. Id. Further probative of intent, the opinion continued, was that Mr. Beyer \u201cexplained [his use of the title \u2018lawyer\u2019] to an elector when the opportunity arose,\u201d and the newspaper article identifying him as a law school graduate without implying he was licensed to practice law. Id. at 12-13. Accordingly, Judge Cohn Jubelirer concluded that the evidence would have dispelled concerns of wrongful intent so as to permit amendment under sections 976 and 977 (described more fully, infra) of the Election Code had the court found a defect in the first place. This timely appeal to our direct appellate jurisdiction followed.\nAppellant Objectors contend the Commonwealth Court erred in failing to find that Mr. Beyer\u2019s self-designation as a lawyer-by-occupation represented a material defect borne of the intent to mislead the electorate. In reviewing an order adjudicating challenges to a nomination petition, our standard of review permits reversal only where the findings of fact are unsupported by substantial evidence, where there was an abuse of discretion, or where an error of law was committed. In re Nomination Petition of Flaherty, 564 Pa. 671, 770 A.2d 327, 331 (2001). Moreover, in reviewing election issues, we must consider the longstanding and overriding policy in our Commonwealth to protect the elective franchise. In re Nomination Petition of Driscoll, 577 Pa. 501, 847 A.2d 44 (2004). In promoting that policy, this Court has made clear that the Election Code must \u201cbe liberally construed to protect a candidate\u2019s right to run for office and the voters\u2019 right to elect the candidate of their choice.\u201d Id. at 49. Nevertheless, the policy of liberally reading the Code cannot be distorted to emasculate the requirements necessary to assure legitimate nomination papers. In re Farnese, 609 Pa. 573, 17 A.3d 375 (2011); McIntyre, 778 A.2d at 751.\nProvisions of the Election Code relating to the form of nominating petitions and the accompanying affidavits are not mere technicalities, but are necessary measures to prevent fraud and to preserve the integrity of the election process. Famese, supra. A party alleging defects in a nominating petition has the burden of proving such defects, as nomination petitions are presumed to be valid. In re Nomination Petition of Gales, 618 Pa. 93, 54 A.3d 855 (2012).\nWe address first whether Mr. Beyer\u2019s statement of occupation/profession represented a defect apparent on the face of his petition. As the General Assembly did not define either \u201coccupation\u201d or \u201cprofession\u201d as those terms appear in the Election Code, we set out to construe them \u201caccording to the rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage[.]\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a).\nOne way to ascertain the plain meaning and ordinary usage of terms is by reference to a dictionary definition. Commonwealth v. Hart, 611 Pa. 531, 28 A.3d 898, 909 (2011). As noted by the court below, the Oxford English Dictionary defines a \u201clawyer\u201d as \u201c[a] person who practices or studies law; an attorney or a counselor.\u201d The same dictionary, however, defines a \u201cprofession\u201d as \u201c[a] paid occupation, especially one that involves prolonged training and a formal qualification,\u201d and assigns a principal definition to \u201coccupation\u201d as \u201c[a] job or a profession.\u201d A \u201cjob,\u201d in turn is defined as \u201c[a] paid position of regular employment.\u201d In accordance with these definitions, the \u201coccupation or profession of lawyer\u201d for purposes of a nomination petition would comprise not only completion of prolonged training in law school but also acquisition of a formal qualification to practice law, which, in this Commonwealth, entails receiving a license to practice.\nFormal reference sources discussing the scope of the occupation or profession of lawyer are scarce, but a survey of Pennsylvania\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct shows they presuppose a \u201clawyer,\u201d as that term is used therein, to be one licensed to practice law. This point is perhaps best exemplified in Rule 5.3, \u201cResponsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistance,\u201d which addresses the responsibilities assumed by lawyers who employ or retain \u201cnonlawyer assistance\u201d in their practices. Insightful for our purposes is that Rule 5.3 designates law students as \u201cnonlawyers,\u201d regardless of their learned status and years of intense legal training. Indeed, no rule of professional conduct promulgated by this Court prescribing the conduct, duties, or responsibilities of \u201clawyers\u201d includes a provision devoted to law school students or graduates who have yet to receive their formal license to practice.\nDuring the hearing below, evidence of informal attitudes or common understandings was likewise scarce, but Mr. Beyer\u2019s own testimony describing his interactions with electors lent insight into what he believed electors would expect of one claiming the occupation of lawyer. Specifically, his testimony revealed how electors\u2019 mere observation of his stated occupation prompted him in all candor to offer a virtual retreat from the statement.\nQ: You said people asked you \u2014 some of the people when you were getting signatures asked you about what you listed, lawyer, correct?\nA: So, people would say \u2014 you know, they would look at the petition, and they would say, \u201cHey I see you\u2019re a lawyer,\u201d and I would say, \u201cOh, you know, I haven\u2019t passed the bar yet, but I plan on taking it sometime in the next year.\u201d\nN.T. 4/11/14 at 56. This response indicates Mr. Beyer, himself, readily differentiated a lawyer from a law school graduate yet to take the bar, and suggests he believed electors would likely hold the perception that being engaged in the present \u201coccupation or profession of lawyer\u201d means actually working, or at least being eligible to work, as a lawyer in the ordinary course of one\u2019s professional life.\nIn this respect, former Chief Justice Castille\u2019s concurring opinion in In Re: Nomination Petition of Guzzardi, 627 Pa. 1, 99 A.3d 381 (2014) is most salutary in delineating the difference between a lawyer and a prospective lawyer in the context of stating one\u2019s present occupation on a nomination petition. In Guzzardi, a gubernatorial candidate described his occupation as a \u201csemi-retired businessman and lawyer\u201d on his nomination petition and SOFI. In fact, though Mr. Guzzardi had practiced law for approximately forty years, he had assumed an inactive status for some period prior to and including the time he completed his petition. Of the five justices voting to strike Mr. Guzzardi\u2019s petition as fatally defective under the Public Official and Employee Ethics Act because it was untimely filed, two amplified that they would have also deemed it disqualifying for a candidate on inactive status with the Pennsylvania Bar to describe himself as a \u201csemi-retired lawyer,\u201d a title that would lead the electorate to believe falsely that he still practiced law part-time.\nIn authoring his concurring statement, then-Chief Justice Castille incorporated his prior dissent in In re Rankin, 583 Pa. 38, 874 A.2d 1145, 1145-48 (2005), a case involving an inactive status candidate who listed her current occupation as \u201cattorney/publisher\u201d:\nWords are a lawyer\u2019s standard in trade, and lawyers should be held to their meaning. A former occupation is not a current occupation. A conditional or equivocal status is not an unequivocal one .... What respondent viewed as an \u201cexplanation\u201d of her conduct at the hearing below, properly understood, was a confession.\nRankin, Id. at 1148 (Castille, J., dissenting) (citations omitted, emphasis added).\nApplying this rationale to the \u201cslightly different\u201d facts of Guzzardi, the concurrence stated that \u201c[a]s all Pennsylvania lawyers know, there is no \u2018semi-retired lawyer\u2019 status for members of the Pennsylvania Bar; attorneys are either active or inactive.\u201d Guzzardi, supra at 389 (Castille, J., concurring). There was no reason to expect, the concurrence concluded, that electors who signed Guzzardi\u2019s petition would have understood the meaning of the ambiguous term \u201csemi-retired\u201d as it related to one\u2019s status with the Pennsylvania Bar. Id.\nThis rationale speaks to the statutory purpose behind the requirement that a candidate supply for the benefit of electors his present occupation or profession, and it dovetails with our reasons cited above for declaring the petitions defective in the case sub judice. Mr. Beyer described himself on the nominating petition as engaged in the present occupation of lawyer when his actual status was that of law school graduate not yet eligible to practice law. While the Oxford Dictionary may include within its definition of \u201clawyer\u201d one who studies the law, a lawyer\u2019s professional or occupational role in society transcends his prior studies in law school. The term \u201clawyer\u201d as used to describe one\u2019s occupation or profession for purposes of the Election Code is not an abstraction, and its scope should not expand so far as to include those who may wish to practice professionally in society but are not yet authorized to do so under our laws; a prospective occupation is not a current occupation. Accordingly, we deemed Mr. Beyer\u2019s statement of occupation appearing on his nomination petitions defective.\nThe defect, moreover, manifested both a material and knowing misrepresentation so as to preclude the possibility of amendment and require that the petitions be set aside. In so deciding, we reversed the order of the Commonwealth Court.\nAccording to section 977 of the Election Code, where a court finds that a nomination petition is defective pursuant to the provisions of section 976, the petition shall be set aside. See id. \u00a7 2937. Meanwhile, section 976 of the Election Code provides that \u201c[n]o nomination petition, nomination paper or nomination certificate shall be permitted to be filed if ... it contains material errors or defects apparent on the face thereof, or on the face of the appended or accompanying affidavits.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2936. Notably, section 977 also provides, however, that where \u201cobjections relate to material errors or defects apparent on the face of the nomination petition or paper, the court, after hearing, may, in its discretion, permit amendments within such time and upon such terms ... as the court may specify.\u201d Id. \u00a7 2937.\nDriscoll, supra at 49. Under its own jurisprudence, the Commonwealth Court has deemed defects \u201cmaterial\u201d when they have the potential to mislead an elector. See In re Ford, 994 A.2d 9 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010); In re Nomination Petition of Delle Donne, 779 A.2d 1 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001), aff'd 565 Pa. 561, 777 A.2d 412 (2001). Only where a candidate intended to mislead the electorate, however, is such a material misrepresentation grounds to preclude amendment of the nomination petition. See Driscoll, supra at 50-51 (citing State Ethics Comm\u2019n v. Baldwin, 498 Pa. 255, 445 A.2d 1208 (1982)).\nDuring the hearing below, Mr. Beyer asserted he did not intend to deceive the electorate about his occupation, and the Commonwealth Court credited that testimony. Our restrictive standard of review as cited above permits us to revisit this aspect of the court\u2019s decision if, inter alia, it is unsupported by substantial evidence. The court predicated its inference of the candidate\u2019s intent on two findings of fact: first, that Mr. Beyer sincerely believed he could properly call himself a lawyer, and, second, that he clarified any potentially misleading aspect to his petition when the opportunities to do so arose. We discern the first predicate regarding the candidate\u2019s beliefs to be beside the essential point of whether he knew his petition as worded would likely mislead electors, and we discredit the second as belied by the substantial evidence of record.\nEven accepting as the Commonwealth Court did that Mr. Beyer sincerely believed there was a place for \u201cone who studies the law\u201d within the definition of a \u201clawyer,\u201d his own testimony revealed that he nevertheless knew his written statement of occupation held the potential to mislead electors. This is the critical point, as it was in this manner that his conduct met the scienter requirements for petition invalidation as expressed in Baldwin and its progeny. Specifically, responding to electors who observed \u201c[s]o, you\u2019re a lawyer?\u201d with \u201c[o]h, you know, I haven\u2019t passed the bar yet but I plan on taking it next year\u201d reflected an understanding that his usage of the term did not fit within society\u2019s general idea of what a lawyer is. Indeed, his prepared response was the functional equivalent of an admission that he was not yet a lawyer as most electors would understand the term, and would not become one until such time that he passed the bar examination. Apparent in his own testimony, therefore, was his appreciation that electors would likely expect more of a \u201clawyer by occupation or profession\u201d than having simply graduated law school. The Commonwealth Court seems to have identified this concern when it found the Candidate used the term \u201clawyer\u201d to \u201cenhance his stature\u201d among electors. In re Beyer, supra at 12. To the extent the candidate knowingly used the term to suggest a professional status he had yet to attain, we agree. Mr. Beyer, through his statement of occupation, implied credentials material to the office of legislator that he simply did not yet possess. Yet, he persisted in circulating a nomination petition that he knew could mislead in this respect.\nFrom the same testimony, however, the Commonwealth Court inferred the absence of wrongful intent because it showed, in the court\u2019s opinion, that Mr. Beyer \u201cexplained [his use of the title \u2018lawyer\u2019] to an elector when the opportunity arose[.]\u201d Id. at 12. Neither relevant authority nor the evidence of record supports the above premise that an opportunity to provide clear information about a candidate arises only when an elector broaches the topic. The court\u2019s position on this point contradicts our jurisprudence recognizing the important role that accurate nomination petitions play in achieving the Election Code\u2019s goal of an informed electorate freely supporting a candidate of their choice. See Driscoll, supra at 50. Every presentment of a petition for signature, therefore, represented an opportunity for Mr. Beyer to identify clearly his occupation, and the candidate knew his petition would likely promote misinformation on that very point. Yet, he implemented an \u201cexplain only if asked\u201d approach. By neglecting this critical aspect of the record, the Commonwealth Court erroneously overlooked the many electors deprived of the benefit of Mr. Beyer\u2019s sporadic and strictly reactive clarifications.\nEvidence that a newspaper article identified him correctly as a recent law school graduate was likewise of dubious probity to the issue of intent, moreover, where the record indicates the report failed to address the topic of his occupation any further. That the candidate did not overtly claim or suggest he was a practicing lawyer in the article did not clarify for electors that he was, in fact, ineligible to practice. Consequently, the article left open to readers\u2019 speculation the matter of whether the candidate was eligible to practice law, and as such had little if any bearing on the misleading nature of the petitions.\nThe court\u2019s inference of the candidate\u2019s intent, therefore, finds support in neither the evidentiary record nor relevant authority. The substantial evidence adduced at the hearing established that Mr. Beyer knew his statement of occupation held the potential to mislead electors about his credentials for the office of lawmaker. While he mitigated that potential in several isolated instances, the necessary implication of the evidence is that many electors remained uninformed by any clarification.\nBased on the foregoing, we concluded that Mr. Beyer\u2019s nomination petitions bore a facial defect, as he was not yet qualified to claim the present occupational or professional status of \u201clawyer.\u201d The defect was both material to an elector\u2019s decision to nominate a legislator and incurable by amendment because the candidate knew his representation had the potential to mislead signers about his credentials for the legislative office he sought. Having demonstrated as much, Objectors met their burden of disproving the presumptive validity of the contested nomination petition. Striking Mr. Beyer\u2019s petition under such circumstances to avoid misleading the electorate was consistent with the Election Code\u2019s purpose of protecting, and not defeating, a citizen\u2019s vote. See Dayhoff v. Weaver, 808 A.2d 1002, 1006 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002). Accordingly, we issued our above-referenced per curiam order vacating the order entered in the Commonwealth Court and setting aside Mr. Beyer\u2019s nomination petitions.\nFormer Chief Justice CASTILLE and former Justice McCAFFERY did not participate in the consideration or rendering of this opinion.\nChief Justice SAYLOR, Justices EAKIN and TODD join the opinion.\nJustice BAER files a dissenting opinion.\n. Section 2912(b) of the Election Code provides, in pertinent part, that a candidate is required to specify his or her \"profession, business, or occupation\u201d on all nomination papers. 25 P.S. \u00a7 2912(b).\n. Notable about candidate\u2019s activities at the time his petitions circulated is that he had not been engaged in the study of law since his graduation. There was no testimony that he was actively preparing for the bar examination, for he had not yet scheduled himself to take the bar, nor did he claim to be working with the law for a lawyer or a judge as a ''nonlawyer assistant.\u201d See Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 5.3, infra. Instead, his only testimony relating to present occupation was that of a real estate consultant to his family, and even that claim was devoid of any indication that Mr. Beyer relied on or applied his legal training to impart legal advice in such endeavor.\n. Our courts have recognized that a candidate's intent to deceive electors by means of an otherwise immaterial defect on the face of the petition is in and of itself sufficient to set aside the petition under section 976 of the Election Code, 25 P.S. \u00a7 2936. See McIntyre, 778 A.2d at 751. This is so because the wrongful intent to deceive the electorate is always material to the election process and should result in forfeit of one\u2019s access to amendment. But, strictly speaking, the \"materiality\u201d of a defect for purposes of sections 976 and 977 (25 P.S. \u00a7 2937) extends beyond intentional acts to include any defect that may affect an elector's nomination decision, i.e., have the propensity to mislead an elector to nominate the candidate. We have recognized that section 977 permits a court, in its discretion, to amend material defects made without the intention to mislead. The Commonwealth Court below, therefore, erroneously limited the scope of \"materiality\u201d when it reasoned that the defect in question was not material to the nomination process in the absence of the candidate's intent to deceive.\n. Implicit in longstanding jurisprudence pertaining to the statutory requisite of facially apparent errors or defects is an expansive interpretation comprising misrepresentations both evident on the face of the petition and ascertainable only through evidence presented at a Section 977 hearing. Though an erroneous listing of the candidate\u2019s primary residence, for example, was not apparent from simply reading the nomination petition, we nevertheless deemed it a defect eligible for amendment under the Section 976 and 977 scheme. See, e.g., Driscoll, 847 A.2d at 51-54 (Pa.2004). See also In re Nomination Petition of Hacker, 728 A.2d 1033, 1035 (Pa.Cmwlth.1999) for similar treatment in the Commonwealth Court. It is by this convention that we assessed whether Mr. Beyer's listed occupation \u2014 the accuracy of which was likewise not plain on the face of the petition itself \u2014 represented a defect to be either set aside or amended.\n. These definitions are quite similar to those the court below referenced:\nThe [Commonwealth Court in Guzzardi ] observed that the definition of \"occupation\u201d includes one\u2019s profession or vocation (citing Webster\u2019s Third International Dictionary 1560 (2002)).[It] further observed that \"profession\u201d is defined as \" '[a] vocation requiring advanced education and training; esp., one of the three traditional learned professions \u2014 law, medicine and the ministry.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1329 (9th ed.2009)).\nIn re Beyer, supra at 11.\n. 204 Pa.Code \u00a7 81.4et.seg.\n. The unpublished opinion below cites the proposition expressed in the single-judge, Commonwealth Court decision in Guzzardi, supra, that, in delineating the difference between an \"attorney\u201d and a \"lawyer,\u201d \"the law student fresh from his school may well be termed a lawyer, but not an attorney.\u201d This quote was taken from a 1909 South Dakota decision. While reasonable minds may, over one century later, still grapple with distinctions between these two designations, there is apparent to this Court no modern tendency among either licensed attorneys or lay persons to accord law school students the \"occupational\u201d or \"professional\u201d status of lawyer unless and until such time as an appropriate sanctioning institution deems them eligible to practice. As for the 1999 federal district court decision from California cited below for the proposition that a lawyer is one who is \"learned in the law\u201d though not necessarily licensed to practice, see Freedom Trust v. Chubb, 38 F.Supp.2d 1170, 1171 n. 1 (C.D.Cal. 1999), that position was expressed briefly in dicta questioning the use of the term \"lawyer\u201d rather than \"attorney\u201d in the California Evidence Code\u2019s reference to the \"lawyer-client privilege.\u201d Notably, the federal judge\u2019s commentary is thus at odds with a code enacted by a duly elected legislature, the California Business and Professional Code, defining a \"lawyer\u201d as a member of the state bar or admitted and eligible to practice in the highest court in any state, and the state court-promulgated California Rules of Professional Conduct 1-100(B)(3) in which the terms \"attorney\u201d and \u201clawyer\" are synonymous with respect to requiring membership in the state bar.\n. Act of October 15, 1998, P.L. 729, No. 93 (as amended 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101-1113).\n. In Rankin, this Court entered a one-sentence per curiam order declining to review the Petition for Allowance of Appeal raising an emergency election issue.\n. A candidate\u2019s experience working with the law relates materially to his or her qualifications for a seat in the General Assembly, and it is reasonable to view an unlicensed and unemployed law school graduate\u2019s occupational profile in these respects as subordinate to and quite different from that of a lawyer. It was in this way that Mr. Beyer enhanced his stature with the nominating public through his false occupational listing.\n. The candidate's inability to deliver his clarification to all electors is critical, as it left many to rely exclusively on a materially defective petition. As observed by then Justice Castille in a similar occurrence in Rankin, supra:\nDuring the hearing, respondent testified as follows!:] \"I tell everybody that I practiced law until four years ago, and then I began publishing the newspaper.\u201d But, that is not what her nominating petitions demonstrate. Respondent did not have personal contact with every elector who signed her petitions to inform them, contrary to what the petition said, that she was actually a \"formerly admitted attorney.\u201d Instead, she created a false impression that respondent was a practicing attorney. How was the electorate to know that respondent was not admitted to practice in Pennsylvania?\nId. at 1148 (Castille, J., dissenting).\n. Nor does the record specify when the respective news reports were published, creating the additional question of whether they were even available to electors prior to the filing deadline. Assuming they were published prior to the acquisition of signatures does not, in any event, affect our assessment that they lacked probity as to the issue before us."}
