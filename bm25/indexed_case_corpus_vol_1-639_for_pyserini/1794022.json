{"id": "1794022", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPAPADAKOS, Justice.\nThis is the appeal of Michael J. Aiello and Kathy Ann Aiello, Appellants, from that portion of the Opinion and Order of the Superior Court which vacated a judgment entered against Ed Saxe Real Estate, Inc. (Saxe), Appellee, and entered judgment N.O.V. in favor of Saxe, in Appellants\u2019 trespass action against Saxe and Sidney F. Jones, Jr. (Jones) for fraudulent misrepresentation.\nAppellants, a young married couple, were interested in purchasing real estate on which they intended to build their home and to subdivide the remainder of the land. After talking with Michael Aiello\u2019s brother, Appellants decided they would contact Ed Saxe Real Estate, Inc., a local real estate agency, owned by Ed Saxe. Jim Aiello had purchased property through Saxe which he subdivided and sold off successfully and Jim convinced Appellants that Saxe would be helpful in locating land which they could subdivide.\nAs sole owner of Ed Saxe Real Estate, Inc., Ed Saxe was the licensed broker pursuant to the \u201cReal Estate Licensing and Registration Act,\u201d Act of February 19, 1980, P.L. 15, No. 9, \u00a7 101, et seq., 63 P.S. \u00a7 455.101, et seq., and, as such, was responsible for all sales and purchases of real estate negotiated by him or through his salespersons. Jones, a licensed salesperson, was employed by Saxe (63 P.S. \u00a7 455.603), displayed his salesperson license in Saxe\u2019s office (63 P.S. \u00a7 455.601), and was actively supervised and trained by Ed Saxe (63 P.S. \u00a7 455.522) pursuant to the requirements imposed upon Ed Saxe by the terms of the Act. When Appellants contacted Saxe, Jones was assigned by Saxe to help them.\nAppellants explained to Jones their interest in acquiring acreage and he began showing them several tracts, including an 87-acre parcel owned by a Mr. Lystad, not a party to this case. This particular tract was the subject of a brokerage agreement between Lystad and Saxe which authorized Saxe to find a buyer for the land.\nWhile viewing this tract, Appellants inquired of Jones whether the property was suitable for a sewage disposal system. Jones assured them that he was familiar with soil types and disposal requirements, that he had reviewed a survey of soils in Huntingdon Township, Adams County (the location of the property), that the soils were good, and that of five percolation tests performed on the subject property, three showed the soil to be suitable for conventional sewage systems and two for sand mounds. Further, Jones stated that had the percolation tests been performed in dry weather, all five would have indicated that the land was suitable for a conventional sewage system.\nBased on these representations, Appellants entered into an agreement for the purchase of the 87-acre tract for $80,000.00. A closing was held in due course and Lystad executed and delivered his deed for the property to Appellants. Subsequently, Appellants conducted their own percolation tests and discovered that the soil was unsuitable for any type of sewage system or sand mound. Upon further investigation, they discovered that a prior sales agreement for the same property negotiated by Saxe had fallen through owing to the failure of the land to pass the five percolation tests. Of a series of twenty-one soil probes, twenty had shown that the soil was unsuited for a sewage system and one probe had indicated that the soil was marginally suitable for a sand mound system, but not a conventional system.\nAppellants, thereupon, filed a trespass action against their agent, Ed Saxe Real Estate, Inc., a broker, and its salesperson, Sidney F. Jones, Jr., for the fraudulent misrepresentations which induced them to purchase the property. The cause proceeded to trial before a jury presided over by the Honorable Oscar F. Spicer, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Adams County and the jury awarded Appellants a verdict for $13,400.00 against Jones and $12,000.00 against Saxe. Appellees\u2019 post-trial motions for Judgment N.O.Y. were denied and the verdict was reduced to judgment. Appellees appealed to the Superior Court arguing various trial court errors, but, in particular, complaining that the trial court erred in charging the jury that it could find liability against Saxe even if it had no prior knowledge of misrepresentations Jones may have made to Appellants.\nSuperior Court agreed, ruling that, in Pennsylvania, proof of scienter on the part of the principal at the time of an agent\u2019s misrepresentations is required to hold a principal liable in damages. Citing its own line of cases, Littler v. Dunbar, 166 Pa.Superior Ct. 271, 70 A.2d 365 (1950), reversed on other grounds, 365 Pa. 277, 74 A.2d 650 (1950); Shane v. Hoffmann, 227 Pa.Superior Ct. 176, 324 A.2d 532 (1974); Eckrich v. DiNardo, 283 Pa.Superior Ct. 84, 423 A.2d 727 (1980), Superior Court concluded that while the general rule is to the contrary, its cases require that where a broker, as principal, is sued for the fraudulent misrepresentation of its salesperson/agent, scienter of the broker must be established in order for recovery to lie against him. Aiello v. Ed Saxe Real Estate, Inc., 327 Pa.Superior Ct. 429, 476 A.2d 27 (1984).\nWe granted allocatur in order to review Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that our law requires that a principal know of the fraudulent misrepresentations of his agent in order to hold the principal liable. Because we find that Saxe\u2019s scienter of his agent\u2019s misrepresentation is not necessary in order to hold Saxe liable to Appellants, we reverse Superior Court\u2019s Order and Opinion and reinstate the judgment entered against Ed Saxe Real Estate, Inc.\nNew legal propositions have been more thoroughly discussed by our Court than those concerning principals and their agents. Out of that considerable body of case law emerges a well-defined rule concerning the vicarious liability of a principal for the misrepresentations of his agent, and the public policy underlying it.\nThese cases instruct us that a principal is liable to third parties for the frauds, deceits, concealments, misrepresentations, torts, negligences and other malfeasances and misfeasances of his agent committed within the scope of his employment even though the principal did not authorize, justify, participate in or know of such conduct or even if he forbade the acts or disapproved of them, as long as they occurred within the agent\u2019s scope of employment. Bachman v. Monte, 326 Pa. 289, 192 A. 485 (1937); Freedman v. Providence Washington Ins. Co., 182 Pa. 64, 37 A. 909 (1897); DeTurck v. Matz, 180 Pa. 347, 36 A. 861 (1897); McNeile v. Cridland, 168 Pa. 16, 31 A. 939 (1895); Independent Bldg. & Loan Assn. v. Real Estate Title Ins. & Trust Co., 156 Pa. 181, 27 A. 62 (1893); Griswold v. Gebbie, 126 Pa. 353, 17 A. 673 (1889); Brooke v. New York, L.E. & W.R.R., 108 Pa. 529, 1 A. 206 (1885); Erie City Iron Works v. Barber and Co., 106 Pa. 125 (1884); Custar v. Titusville Gas & Water Co., 63 Pa. 381 (1869); Shelhamer v. Thomas, 7 Serg. & R 106 (1821); Phoenix Insurance Co. v. Pratt, 2 Binn. 308 (1810); see also, Restatement of Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 257, 258.\nThis rule of liability is not based upon any presumed authority in the agent to do the acts, but on the ground of public policy, that it is more reasonable that when one of two innocent persons must suffer from the wrongful act of a third person, that the principal who has placed the agent in the position of trust and confidence should suffer, rather than an innocent stranger. Erie City; Brooke; Griswold; Cairns v. Pepper, 133 Pa. 114, 19 A. 336 (1890); Hayworth v. Truby, 138 Pa. 222, 20 A. 942 (1890); Independent B & L Association; McNeile; DeTurck; Brooke; Bachman.\nThis result can be reached similarly on the familiar ground that when an agent exceeds his authority, his principal cannot benefit of his act and at the same time repudiate his authority. He must take the benefit to be derived from the transaction subject to his agent\u2019s fraud. Erie; Griswold; Freedman; McNeile; Williams v. Kerr, 152 Pa. 560, 25 A. 618 (1893); Wheeler v. Wilson Mfg. Co. v. Aughey, 144 Pa. 398, 22 A. 667 (1891); Penn Natural Gas Co. v. Cook, 123 Pa. 170, 16 A. 762 (1889). Hughes v. First National Bank, 110 Pa. 428, 1 A. 417 (1885); Jones v. National Bldg. Assn., 94 Pa. 215 (1880); Mundorff v. Wickersham, 63 Pa. 87 (1869); Musser v. Hyde, 2 Watts & S, 314 (1841).\nSuperior Court\u2019s reliance on its line of cases (Shane v. Hoffmann, 227 Pa.Superior Ct. 176, 324 A.2d 532 (1974); Littler v. Dunbar, 166 Pa.Superior Ct. 271, 70 A.2d 365, reversed on other grounds, 365 Pa. 277, 74 A.2d 650 (1950)), which were cited as authority for the proposition that scienter is required on the part of the principal at the time the agent makes the misrepresentation were wrongly decided and are based on misreadings of our earlier cases. In Littler, a case involving an action in fraud and deceit brought by purchasers of real estate against the real estate and his broker, it is true that we approved Superior Court\u2019s conclusion that proof of scienter on the part of the principal was essential to finding liability against the principal, but that conclusion was based on a misreading of our earlier cases, Keefe v. Sholl, 181 Pa. 90, 37 A. 116 (1897) and Freyer v. McCord, 165 Pa. 539, 30 A. 1024 (1895). Both those cases in turn refer back to Griswold v. Gebbie, 126 Pa. 353, 17 A. 73 (1889), as authority for the proposition that scienter of the misrepresentation is required and here lies the source of the problem.\nGriswold involved a suit brought by purchasers of real estate (Mr. and Mrs. Gebbie) against the grantor (Mrs. Griswold) for the fraudulent misrepresentations of her brother-in-law, Mr. John Griswold, her agent. These statements induced the Gebbies to purchase Mrs. Griswold\u2019s property. At Mr. Griswold\u2019s direction, the property was advertised by circular as consisting of nearly seven acres and when the Gebbies viewed the property, Mr. Griswold verified to them that the property consisted of seven acres. Based on his representations, the Gebbies purchased the property for $23,000.00.\nNearly five years after the Gebbies purchased the property, a survey of the land became necessary and the true acreage was determined to be 4.2 acres. The Gebbies brought suit against Mrs. Griswold, for her brother-in-law\u2019s misrepresentation and were successful, receiving a verdict in their favor for $3,640.00.\nMrs. Griswold appealed to this Court arguing that there was no evidence showing that Mr. Griswold\u2019s statements were made within the scope of his authority, as her agent, or that his statements were sufficient to show that Mr. Griswold knew the statements to be false or deceitful. In rejecting her claims, the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Mitchell, made clear that scienter must not only be alleged, but proved. But we there were referring to the requirement that the agent\u2019s knowledge that his statements were false or recklessly asserted in ignorance of fact had to be established. It was scienter of the agent and not the principal that was crucial. Accordingly, it was stated that \u201cscienter must not only be alleged, but proved, and the jury must be satisfied that the defendant (agent) made a statement knowing it to be false, or with such conscious ignorance of its truth, as to be equivalent to a falsehood.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Griswold, 126 Pa. at 363, 17 A. 73.\nWe specifically found untenable Mrs. Griswold\u2019s argument that she could not be liable for the statements of her agent:\nWhere, as here, the misstatement is made by advertisement, and by descriptive circular, is repeated at least twice orally in response to the direct question of the intended purchaser, and is altogether unexplained by the person making it, though his principal and those connected with him in the transaction are shown to have been absolutely ignorant on the subject, we cannot say that there was not a prima facie case to go to the jury. Griswold, 126 Pa. at 365, 17 A. 73. (Emphasis added).\nIn so ruling, the court was only reaffirming the general rule that a principal is responsible for the misrepresentations of his agent made within his authority. In Freyer and Keefe, however, Griswold was misapplied and recovery against the principals was denied because proof of their knowledge of their agent misrepresentations was lacking. As can be seen, Griswold did not require scienter on the part of the principal and it follows then that Freyer, Keefe, and those cases citing Freyer and Keefe, were wrongly decided and are now expressly disapproved.\nToday we reaffirm the longstanding and widely held rule of law that a principal is liable to innocent third parties for the frauds, deceits, concealments, misrepresentations, torts, negligences and other malfeasances or misfeasances of his agent committed in the course of his employment, although the principal did not authorize, justify or participate in, or indeed know of, such misconduct, or even if he forbade the acts or disapproved of them.\nTo hold otherwise is to violate public policy and permit the person who held out his agent as worthy of trust and confidence, to escape liability for his agent\u2019s deceits and frauds, while at the same time reaping the fruits of his agent\u2019s fraud, all at the expense of an innocent third party. Such a holding would be contrary to natural justice and common honesty.\nAccordingly, we perceive no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling that Saxe could be held liable for Jones\u2019s misrepresentation, even if Saxe had no knowledge of Jones\u2019s misrepresentations, and reverse Superior Court\u2019s contrary conclusion.\nIt was undisputed at trial that Jones was hired as a salesman for Saxe; that he had his license displayed in its office; that Saxe was the responsible broker for this transaction; that the commission earned from the sale of the subject property ($5,600.00) was paid over to Saxe, and that from this commission, Saxe paid Jones his fee of $1,400.00 for negotiating the sale of the subject property.\nMoreover, under the Real Estate Licensing Act, 63 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 455.522, 455.604(16), Ed Saxe was bound to train and supervise the conduct of Jones; to receive commissions generated by Jones\u2019s sale; and to pay him his fee for negotiating the sale (63 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 455.604(6), (12)). Taking all these facts together, they were sufficient for the trial court to conclude that Saxe exercised sufficient control over Jones to make him, as a matter of law, its agent. As such, Jones\u2019s misrepresentations concerning the soil suitability of the subject property made while he was trying to persuade Appellants to purchase this property, were representations made in the scope of his apparent authority and bound his principal, regardless of whether Saxe knew of the statements. It is clear that Saxe cannot retain the commission earned by the sale and at the same time repudiate Jones\u2019s agency or the statements made by him by means of which it obtained that commission. Saxe accepted the commission subject to Jones\u2019s fraudulent statement and the maxim qui sentit commodum sentir\u00e9 debet et onus (he who receives the advantage ought also to suffer the burden) applies.\nThe Opinion and Order of Superior Court entering judgment N.O.V. in favor of Saxe is reversed and the judgment entered against Ed Saxe Real Estate, Inc., by the trial court is reinstated.\nFLAHERTY, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nZAPPALA, J., concurred in the result.\n. A \"broker\" is defined at 63 P.S. \u00a7 455.201, in pertinent part, as: Any person who, for another and for a fee, commission or other valuable consideration:\n(1) negotiates with or aids any person in locating or obtaining for purchase, lease or acquisition of interest in any real estate;\n(2) negotiates the listing, sale, purchase, exchange, lease, time share and similarly designed interests, financing or option for any real estate;\n(5) undertakes to promote the sale, exchange, purchase or rental of real estate...\nA \u201csalesperson\u201d is defined as:\nAny person employed by a licensed real estate broker to list for sale, sell or offer for sale, to buy or offer to buy or to negotiate the purchase or sale or exchange of real estate or to negotiate the purchase or sale or exchange of real estate or to negotiate a loan on real estate or to lease or rent or offer to lease, rent or place for rent, any real estate or collect or offer or attempt to collect rent for the use of real estate for or in behalf of such real estate broker. No person employed by a broker to perform duties other than those activities as defined herein under \u201cbroker\u201d shall be required to be licensed as a salesperson.\n. 63 P.S. \u00a7 455.603 provides:\nNo associate broker or salesperson ... shall be employed by any other broker than is designated upon the current license issued to said associate broker or said salesperson.\n. 63 P.S. \u00a7 455.601 provides in pertinent part:\n(a) Each resident licensed broker ... shall maintain a fixed office within this Commonwealth. The current license of a broker and of each licensee employed by such broker shall be prominently displayed in an office of the broker ...\n. That section requires that when a salesperson license application is made, that:\nThe applicant shall submit a sworn statement by the broker with whom he desires to be affiliated certifying that the broker will actively supervise and train the applicant.\n.
