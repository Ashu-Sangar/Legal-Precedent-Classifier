{"id": "1839735", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Chief Justice.\nIn this case, we must determine whether the Millcreek Township Board of Supervisors acted properly when it rejected a challenge to its zoning ordinance for allegedly excluding mobile homes in violation of our Constitution. Our decision will turn on whether the record contains sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that the ordinance is constitutionally valid. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Board acted properly.\nThis case arose out of the following set of facts. Appellant BAC, Inc., (BAC) owns a parcel of real estate in Millcreek Township (Township). BAC desires to use the land as a mobile home park. However, the property is located in two zoning districts that do not permit mobile homes. Mobile home parks are only permitted in areas zoned \u201cC\u201d Residence Districts.\nOn December 8, 1987, BAC filed with the Millcreek Township Board of Supervisors (Board) a challenge to the validity of the zoning ordinance. The validity challenge incorporated four proposed curative amendments to permit the construction of a mobile home park on BAC\u2019s land. The Board conducted three days of hearings and on January 23, 1989, rejected BAC\u2019s challenge and its curative amendments. Specifically, the Board concluded that the zoning ordinance is \u201cnot exclusionary\u201d and that it \u201cmakes adequate and reasonable provision for a \u2018fair share\u2019 of mobilehomes and mobilehome parks.\u201d In the Matter of the Challenge of BAC, Inc., slip op. at 22-23 (Board of Supervisors, Millcreek Township, Jan. 23, 1989).\nOn appeal, the Court of Common Pleas rejected the Board\u2019s conclusion and reversed its adjudication as an abuse of discretion and an error of law. The court took this action after performing the analysis we articulated in Surrick v. Zoning Hearing Bd. of Upper Providence Township, 476 Pa. 182, 382 A.2d 105 (1977), to assess whether a zoning ordinance is unconstitutionally exclusionary.\nThe Board appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which also applied the Surrick analysis. The Commonwealth Court reversed the Order of the Court of Common Pleas because the Board\u2019s conclusion that the Township makes provision for a \u201cfair share\u201d of mobile homes was \u201csupported by the evidence.\u201d Bd. of Supervisors of Millcreek Township v. BAC, Inc., 137 Pa.Commw. 494, 505, 586 A.2d 1011, 1017 (1991). BAC subsequently sought allowance of appeal. We granted allocatur in order to determine if the Board\u2019s adjudication could be sustained in light of our discussion in Surrick. 528 Pa. 618, 596 A.2d 801 (1991). We hold that the .Board acted properly in rejecting BAC\u2019s challenge to the validity of the Township\u2019s zoning ordinance.\nWe begin by reviewing our decision in Surrick. In that case, we formulated an analytical method for assessing whether a zoning ordinance is unconstitutionally exclusionary. The procedure we devised grew out of a series of decisions relating back to two constitutional principles. The first is that individuals have the right to enjoy private property. Pa. Const, art. I, \u00a7 1. The second is that any governmental exercise of police power to interfere with this right must be reasonable to comply with federal due process requirements. U.S. Const. amends. V and XIV; Girsh Appeal, 437 Pa. 237, 241 n. 3, 263 A.2d 395, 397 n. 3 (1970). The latter principle demands that a zoning ordinance be substantially related to the protection of the public welfare. National Land and Investment Co. v. Easttown Township Bd. of Adjustment, 419 Pa. 504, 522, 215 A.2d 597, 607 (1965).\nThese core principles inspired our decisions in a line of cases collectively embracing the following view: Where a municipal subdivision is a logical place for development to occur, it must assume its rightful part of the burdens associated with development, neither isolating itself nor ignoring the housing needs of the larger region. See Township of Willistown v. Chesterdale Farms, Inc., 462 Pa. 445, 341 A.2d 466 (1975); Concord Township Appeal, 439 Pa. 466, 268 A.2d 765 (1970); Girsh Appeal, 437 Pa. 237, 263 A.2d 395 (1970); National Land, 419 Pa. 504, 215 A.2d 597 (1965). This philosophy finds concrete expression in the \u201cfair share\u201d principle, which this Court has adopted. It requires local political units to \u201cplan for and provide land use regulations which meet the legitimate needs of all categories of people who may desire to live within its boundaries.\u201d Surrick, 476 Pa. at 189, 382 A.2d at 108.\nA municipality violates this principle if it practices exclusionary zoning, which could exist in one of two forms. A particular use could be totally excluded. Such was the case in Girsh Appeal, where the ordinance made no provision for multiunit apartment buildings. Alternatively, a zoning ordinance could partially exclude a use to such an extent that it engages in \u201ctokenism\u201d or \u201cselective admission.\u201d That was the objection we had in Willistown, where 80 of the township\u2019s 11,589 acres were set aside for apartments.\nIn order to facilitate the review of ordinances alleged to be exclusionary, Surrick synthesized a three-part analysis which grew out of the approach taken in earlier cases. The first two parts raise threshold inquiries focusing on a municipality\u2019s propensity for population growth and its capacity to accommodate additional development. Surrick, 476 Pa. at 192, 382 A.2d at 110. If a community is a logical area for development and its present level of development does not preclude further development, then it is necessary to conduct the third inquiry, which focuses on determining the exclusionary impact of the zoning ordinance. Id. at 194, 382 A.2d at 111.\nWe begin our analysis of the case at bar by noting that the zoning ordinance is presumed to be valid; therefore, BAC assumes the burden to prove its invalidity. National Land, 419 Pa. at 522, 215 A.2d at 607. By concluding that the zoning ordinance does not unconstitutionally exclude mobile homes, the Board implied that BAC failed to carry its burden. No additional evidence was presented subsequent to the Board\u2019s adjudication. Because of this, we are limited to determining whether the Board committed a manifest abuse of discretion or an error of law. Id. at 523, 215 A.2d at 607. Operating within this scope of review, we find that the Board acted properly in rejecting BAC\u2019s challenge to the constitutional validity of the Township\u2019s zoning ordinance.\nIn Surrick, we indicated that the critical inquiry into the exclusionary impact of a zoning ordinance must be conducted if it has been determined that the municipality is a logical place for growth and is not already highly developed. The Board did not make a finding with respect to these two threshold inquiries. However, we conclude that even if Mill-creek satisfies these two threshold conditions, the record does not contain sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption that the zoning ordinance is valid.\nAlthough BAC claims that the zoning ordinance is unconstitutionally excluding mobile homes, it cites no evidence in support thereof. Instead, it points to evidence purporting to establish that the Township has not made adequate allowances for housing for low to moderate income families. The Court of Common Pleas relied on this same evidence as the basis for its decision to reverse the Board\u2019s adjudication. However, this evidence has no value because it addresses whether Millcreek is impermissibly excluding certain classes or groups of people. That question is entirely different from the one BAC raised in its validity challenge.\nIn Surrick, we recognized a clear distinction between restrictions on uses of property and exclusions of classes of people. We stressed that only the former is the proper subject of the analysis we synthesized. This is because it flows from the constitutionally protected right to own and enjoy property. Thus, it grew out of a line of cases striking down zoning schemes for restricting or excluding certain uses of property, not classes of people. Surrick, 476 Pa. at 193 n. 10, 382 A.2d at 110-11 n. 10. Since the focus of BAC\u2019s challenge is that the zoning ordinance does not make reasonable provision for mobile home uses, its reliance on evidence relating to the Township\u2019s alleged failure to accommodate a certain class of people is misplaced. Furthermore, because BAC refers to no additional evidence in support of its claim, we are constrained to hold that it failed to carry its burden to rebut the presumption that the zoning ordinance is valid.\nThe Board said that it rejected BAC\u2019s challenge because it found that the zoning ordinance is not exclusionary. The Commonwealth Court gave the same reason for its decision to reverse the Court of Common Pleas. It was unnecessary for this finding to be made because BAC did not rebut the presumption of validity. Furthermore, we make no judgment with respect to the Board\u2019s finding. Our only conclusion is that, because BAC failed to carry its burden, the Board acted properly in rejecting the challenge to the constitutionality of its zoning ordinance.\nAccordingly, we affirm the Order of the Commonwealth Court.\nPAPADAKOS, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n.
