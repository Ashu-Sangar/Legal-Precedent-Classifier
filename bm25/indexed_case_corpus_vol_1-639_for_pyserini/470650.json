{"id": "470650", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThis is an appeal from the discharge of a rule to permit the filing of an election contest nunc, pro tunc.\nKelly and Beattie were rival candidates for the office of tax collector of Horsham Township, Montgomery County, at an election held November 6, 1945. Returns by the township district election board to the county board of elections certified that Beattie had received 321 votes and Kelly 304 votes. The county board issued a certificate of election to Beattie. On December 12, 1945, 36 days after the election, a petition was filed in the court below for a recount, which was granted. On a recount each candidate was found to have received 308 votes. There were 9 military votes, not counted by the recount board, but which originally had been found by the county board to be divided as follows: 3 votes for Beattie and 6 votes for Kelly. It was then apparent that Kelly had received 314 and Beattie 311 legal votes. On December 22, 1945,\u2014 46 days after the election and 26 days after the statutory period for filing an election appeal had expired \u2014 a petition was presented for a rule to show cause why an appeal should not be permitted to be filed nunc pro tuno. Upon answer filed the rule was discharged in an opinion by Judge Corson. This appeal followed.\nWe are in complete accord with the opinion and order of the court below. Elections and their regulations are exclusively for the legislature: Thompson v. Morrison, 352 Pa. 616, 44 A. 2d 55. The Act of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, 25 PS 2601, is the \u201cPennsylvania Election Code.\u201d Article XVII, section 1756, 25 PS 3456, prescribes that election contests must be commenced \u201cwithin twenty days after the day of .. . election.\u201d Under Article XVII, section 1701 (f), 25 PS 3261 (f), it is provided that ballot boxes may be opened \u201cat any time within four months after the date of the . . . election\u201d. While at first these provisions may appear inconsistent, they are in fact not in conflict. The appeal must be taken within the 20 days as fixed by the statute. The petition to open ballot boxes, permitted to be filed within four months, may result in the production of evidence which may, or may not, cause the appeal to be sustained. In the present case, one day after the election, Miss Kelly heard rumors that the count was irregular. She could have promptly proceeded, within 20 days from the election, to take an appeal. The proceeding for the opening of the ballot boxes could have followed in due course. Instead of doing this, Miss Kelly awaited the ascertainment of the results of the ballot box opening, and then sought to file her appeal nunc pro tunc. Such relief the court is unable to render. She is required to follow the statutory procedure. In Greenwood Township Election Case, 344 Pa. 350, 25 A. 2d 330, Mr. Justice Patterson said, p. 356: \u201cAppellant had twenty days after the election within which to institute contest proceedings, but failed to do so, and if he has lost an opportunity to contest the election, by lapse of the statutory period prior to completion of the recount proceedings, the court is without power to aid him: Armstrong\u2019s Appeal, 293 Pa. 1, 6. . . .\u201d\nAppellant refers to Koch Election Contest Case, 351 Pa. 544, 41 A. 2d 657, in which the posted return showed that Koch was elected. The hoard thereafter erroneously certified the election of Koch\u2019s opponent who was defeated. The Board failed to comply with the Code as to notice hy posting. Koch, who in fact was elected, and the public, were thereby deceived. Koch moved promptly to correct the fraud or mistake in the board\u2019s return.\nAppellant failed to comply with the provisions of the election code, and thereby lost her opportunity to contest the election.\nThe order of the court below is affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost."}
