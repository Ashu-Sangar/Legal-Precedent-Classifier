{"id": "1813543", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from the order of Superior Court, affirming appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse following a jury trial. The issue is whether the trial court properly permitted expert testimony regarding the victim\u2019s afflication with \u201crape trauma syndrome\u201d (RTS). We hold that such testimony is inadmissible, and therefore vacate the judgment of sentence and remand for a new trial.\nUncontroverted evidence establishes that on November 26, 1977, an intruder gained entry to the home of the victim by posing as a police officer, then raped her and forced her to submit to other sexual outrages. The victim described the assailant to the police and reported that he identified himself as Gallagher. Two weeks later, on December 10, 1977, the victim examined a photographic display containing the appellant\u2019s picture and also faced him in a voluntary one-on-one confrontation; in neither instance did she identify him.\nMore than four years later, however, the victim identified the appellant from a photographic display. The appellant was then arrested on February 19, 1982, and charged with rape and numerous related offenses. Prior to his arrest, however, the statute of limitations had expired on all the offenses except involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Accordingly, he was tried only for the latter offense.\nAt his jury trial, the appellant contested his identification as the rapist. In order to downplay the victim\u2019s repeated failures to identify appellant within weeks of the crimes and bolster her identification after four years, the Commonwealth presented Ann Burgess as an expert witness with respect to RTS. Burgess holds a master\u2019s degree in psychiatric nursing and a doctorate in nursing science. Together with a colleague, Professor Lynda Holmstrom of Boston College, Burgess co-authored an article in the American Journal of Psychiatry which is credited with being the first study of victims of sexual attack to use the term \u201crape trauma syndrome.\u201d Burgess\u2019s qualifications included extensive teaching, research, writing, and forensic experience with the psychological effects found in rape victims. She described the symptomology of the syndrome, now accepted as a standard post-traumatic stress response disorder by the American Psychiatric Association. She then summarized her examination of the victim, stated her diagnosis that the victim suffered from RTS, and related her opinion of how the phenomena of RTS bore upon the identification process.\nThe appellant was convicted by jury, his post-verdict motions were denied, and he was sentenced to serve ten to twenty years imprisonment. On appeal, a divided panel of the Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. The primary issue is whether Burgess\u2019s testimony regarding RTS was admissible. We hold that the testimony was an impermissible encroachment on the jury\u2019s function of determining credibility, and reverse the judgment of sentence.\nAt the appellant\u2019s trial, there was no question that the victim had been sexually assaulted; the principal question for the jury was the identity of the attacker. The victim\u2019s positive, indeed animated, identification of the appellant at trial was seriously undermined by the fact that she had been unable to identify him two weeks after the crime. The testimony of Burgess regarding RTS was introduced for the sole purpose of shoring up the credibility of the victim on the crucial issue of identification.\nDeterminations of credibility, however, are exclusively the province of the jury. Commonwealth v. Seese, 512 Pa. 439, 443, 517 A.2d 920, 922 (1986). We have consistently rejected expert testimony which encroaches on this vital jury question. Kozak v. Struth, 515 Pa. 554, 531 A.2d 420 (1987) (prohibiting expert testimony on causation and due care because issues of ultimate fact, especially those of credibility, are for jury, not expert); Commonwealth v. Seese, supra (prohibiting expert medical testimony regarding the veracity of children who claim to be objects of sexual abuse); Commonwealth v. O\u2019Searo, 466 Pa. 224, 352 A.2d 30 (1976) (prohibiting expert testimony of clinical psychologist to substantiate and corroborate the defendant\u2019s version of the critical events). We must examine the testimony of Burgess in light of this standard.\nBurgess first described RTS as occurring in two phases. The first is the acute phase, lasting days or weeks, during which the victim is emotionally overwhelmed and has difficulty performing ordinary functions; this is followed by a long term reorganization phase, lasting months or years, during which the victim deals with symptoms specific to the rape which must be integrated into the victim\u2019s psychological experience to enable her to function at a precrisis level. Burgess then elaborated on how these symptoms could affect the victim\u2019s ability to identify the rapist:\nQ And, what about the phobia about repetition of seeing the face? Could you describe that and explain that to us? A The \u2014 right. She had an opportunity to see the assailant\u2019s face, and, so, that imprinted, if you will, in her mind, and that is a flashback. That keeps coming back.\nIn fact, right after the assault, she described how this would happen, where suddenly thinking she saw someone, again a common reaction that she also had, feeling that he is everywhere, because the assault was still so new, still so fresh.\nQ How is that integrated, that phobia?\nA ....\nIt\u2019s a gradual process.\nQ Is a five-year time period a telling time period for this gradual integration process?\nA Our study of our victims showed four to six years later we had still twenty-five percent that were still very symptomatic. We had others, of course, who had recovered, but five years you still have a very \u2014 in certain areas you can have specific symptoms in the phobic area, because that\u2019s more or less the definition of a phobia. It wards off into a particular area of symptoms.\nQ And, would that account for her flood of emotions still to this day about the material?\nA Yes. What seems to happen in the research we have been looking at is traumatic events are what is called actively stored in the mind, and when a certain, if you will, button is pressed: i.e., seeing someone, or whatever, all of that emotion and everything can just come flooding back, and that\u2019s the phenomenon of a flashback out of the past.\nAn event comes back, because there has been some triggering in the environment that the person is in, and it just kind of brings it all back.\nQ By bringing it all back, does it also bring the phase back of the original assailant? Is that the kind of thing that would flash right back before your eyes?\nA Oh, yes.\nMR. STANSHINE [Defense counsel]: Objection.\nTHE COURT: Overruled.\nBY MS. FLEISHMAN [Prosecutor]:\nQ And, could you describe in terms of a heart attack, so that we can understand what that flashback might feel like, could you draw an analogy to a heart attack?\nA Yes. We are doing a study now of men who have had heart attacks, and a heart attack is another confrontation with death, and many men feel they are going to die when they have a heart attack.\nHe had had symptoms not only of pain, but of nausea, so you have two linking, if you will, phenomena that in his mind \u2014 if you want to think of the mind like a computer button \u2014 was pressed, and the image came back.\nQ Did you find that symptom to be true of that flood or flashback symptom in [the victim]?\nA Yes, I did.\nThe crux of the testimony appears to be that the victim\u2019s failure to identify the appellant two weeks after the rape is unremarkable, as she was in the acute phase of RTS in which a victim has difficulty performing even normal functions, and the in-court identification five years later is particularly credible, as it results from a flashback, with the mind operating like a computer. It is clear that the only purpose of the expert testimony was to enhance the credibility of the victim.\nWe stated in Seese, supra:\nThe question of whether a particular witness is testifying in a truthful manner is one that must be answered in reliance upon inferences drawn from the ordinary experiences of life and common knowledge as to the natural tendencies of human nature, as well as upon observations of the demeanor and character of the witness____ [T]he question of a witness\u2019 credibility has routinely been reserved exclusively for the jury.\n512 Pa. at 443, 517 A.2d at 922 (citations omitted; emphasis added). Such testimony would invest the opinions of experts with an unwarranted appearance of authority on the subject of credibility, which is within the facility of the ordinary juror to assess.\nWe therefore hold that expert testimony on rape trauma syndrome should not have been admitted in the trial of this case. Accordingly, we reverse the order of Superior Court and remand for a new trial.\nOrder reversed and case remanded.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nPAPADAKOS, J., files a dissenting opinion which is joined by NIX, C.J.\n. Burgess and Holmstrom, Rape Trauma Syndrome, 131 AMJ. PSYCHIATRY 981 (1974).\n. The victim\u2019s testimony was punctuated by repeated outbursts such as the following:\nThere he is, he\u2019s the one. He wanted to be caught. He knew he was getting caught. He wanted to get caught. And there he is, caught, Tony Gallagher.\nAnd he got away that day. And I knew it was him. And that\u2019s why I have chased him, Tony Gallagher, for five years because I knew that he pulled that off on the cops. I knew the cops didn't know him. I knew him.\nHe was too sneaky, too devious. The cops weren\u2019t on to him. I knew him, they didn\u2019t know him\u2014\n[I]t just sets me crazy to see him walking, to know that he did this to me, that he got away with it, because he is devious, sneaky and lying, and I am not lying.\nHe is the one. He knows he is the one. And I know he\u2019s the one. But the cops didn\u2019t know it because they don\u2019t know him the way I know him.\nQ Now are you positive that the man you have identified today in this courtroom is the man that sexually assaulted you November 26, 1977?\nA I am very positive.\nHe knows it, I know it.\nBefore this is over, every one of you will know it, every one of you will know it the way I know it.\n. We need not reach the appellant\u2019s argument that RTS is not sufficiently reliable to be admissible as it has not been widely enough accepted by the scientific community, nor the additional argument that RTS has developed as a therapeutic tool for the treatment of stress-related symptoms, not as a forensic tool to ascertain facts which might be useful to a jury."}
