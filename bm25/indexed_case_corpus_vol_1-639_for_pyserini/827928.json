Griffith and William H. Griffith. He sues on their contract, and must take it in all its parts.\u201d This is the key to the whole case. The plaintiff\u2019s rights do not go beyond the assignment to him from the Griffiths, nor can they rise higher than theirs. If we concede that the company was defectively organized, neither the Griffiths, nor any one claiming under or through them, could take advantage of such defect, for the reason that the Griffiths were members of said company, and contracted inter sese in their articles of association, that the liability of their company should be limited to the stock subscribed.\nJ udgment affirmed."}
