{"id": "989706", "contents": "Pee Cueiam,\nThe first fifteen specifications of error are to the action of the court below \u201cin not sustaining\u201d the therein recited exceptions taken by the defendant to the report of the learned referee.\nOur consideration of the report, in connection with the evidence, has not convinced us that said exceptions were well taken, and hence they were rightly overruled. There appears to be nothing in any of them that requires discussion. We find no substantial error in either of the referee\u2019s findings of fact or conclusions of law.\nThe only remaining specification, \u201c in directing judgment to be entered on the report in accordance with its findings,\u201d cannot of course, be sustained. The entry of judgment was the logical sequence of the findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nJudgment affirmed."}
