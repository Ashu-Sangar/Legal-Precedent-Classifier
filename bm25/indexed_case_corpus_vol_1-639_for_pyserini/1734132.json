{"id": "1734132", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nOn July 1, 1970, appellee, Edward Harry Bole, was a passenger in an automobile owned and operated by George Kocsis. Appellee was seriously injured when the Kocsis auto struck two parked cars. Another passenger was killed in the accident.\nAt the time of the accident, Kocsis carried a $25,000 single limit liability policy with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company. By way of settlement, appellee recovered $11,876 from Kocsis\u2019 liability carrier. Appellee then submitted a claim to his insurance company, appellant, Nationwide Insurance Company, pursuant to a $10,000 uninsured motorist provision contained in the policy.\nNationwide refused payment. In June of 1972, appellee requested that the claim be submitted to arbitration. The insurance policy provided for common law arbitration, with each party choosing a \u201ccompetent and disinterested arbitrator.\u201d These two arbitrators would then select a third arbitrator.\nBoth Nationwide and Bole selected an arbitrator. Bole objected to Nationwide\u2019s choice, Karl Brueck, Jr., Esquire, because Mr. Brueck had provided legal representation for Nationwide in the past. Mr. Brueck, however, refused to disqualify himself. The third arbitrator was agreed upon. At the hearing, Bole again objected to Mr. Brueck, who again refused to disqualify himself. Following the hearing, an award was given against Bole in favor of Nationwide. The arbitrator chosen by Bole dissented from the award.\nAppellee filed a petition and rule to vacate the award of arbitrators in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, again claiming, inter alia, that Mr. Brueck should have disqualified himself. The court, however, denied appellee\u2019s petition and confirmed the arbitrators\u2019 award.\nAn appeal was taken to the Superior Court, which decided the case in December of 1975. Bole v. Nationwide Insurance, 238 Pa.Super. 138, 352 A.2d 472 (1975). A majority of that court ordered a remand, but the court was divided on the scope of the remand. Judge Spaeth, in an opinion joined by Judges Hoffman and Cercone, expressed a belief that the matter should be remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine if Mr. Brueck\u2019s past representation of Nationwide evidenced an actual bias. Judge Van der Voort, in an opinion joined by President Judge Watkins, indicated the award should be vacated and the case remanded for appointment of new arbitrators, because they felt prior representation of a party by an arbitrator should require disqualification of that arbitrator upon objection by the opposing party, with no showing of actual bias required. Judge Price filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Judge Jacobs, in which he expressed the view that partisan appointments were permissible and that the award should be confirmed. In March of 1976, we granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nWe must first determine what effect prior representation by an arbitrator under this contract of insurance has on the capacity of that arbitrator to serve.\nWe are of the opinion that the per se rule espoused by Judge Van der Voort in his opinion is correct. We thus vacate the award of the arbitrators and remand the case for the selection and appointment of a new panel of arbitrators.\nThe instant dispute involves common law arbitration with its limited scope of judicial review. As we stated in Allstate Ins. Co. v. Fioravanti, 451 Pa. 108, 114, 299 A.2d 585, 588 (1978),\n\u201c. . . [Ajppellant, to succeed, must show by clear, precise and indubitable evidence that he was denied a hearing, or that there was fraud, misconduct, corruption or some other irregularity of this nature on the part of the arbitrator which caused him to render an unjust, inequitable, or unconscionable award, the arbitrator being the final judge of both law and fact, his award not being subject to disturbance for a mistake of either.\u201d\nAs a common law arbitration award cannot be reversed for either a mistake of law or fact, we believe it best to avoid even a hint of impropriety when a contract calls for a \u201cdisinterested\u201d arbitrator.\nAs Judge Van der Voort stated in his opinion:\n\u201cBecause they are the final decisionmakers on the law and facts of the case, whose decision is final absent fraud or misconduct, arbitrators under common law stand as judges. Their function is judicial, and their conduct must be robed in judicial impartiality. . . . \u201d\nIn Kolb\u2019s Case, 4 Watts 154 (1835), we held that a judge should disqualify himself when he has served as counsel for one of the parties, and we believe that principle is equally applicable today.\nWhile not controlling in the instant case, \u00a7 18 of the Rules of the American Arbitration Association is helpful. It states:\n\u201cDisclosure by Arbitrator of Disqualification \u2014 At the time of receiving his notice of appointment, the prospective arbitrator is requested to disclose any circumstances likely to create a presumption of bias or which he believes might disqualify him as an impartial arbitrator. Upon receipt of such information, the Tribunal Clerk shall immediately disclose it to the parties, who if willing to proceed under the circumstances disclosed, shall in writing, so advise the Tribunal. If either party declines to waive the presumptive disqualification, the vacancy thus created shall be filled in accordance with applicable provisions of this Rule.\u201d\nSee also Commonwealth Corp. v. Casualty Co., 393 U.S. 145, 89 S.Ct. 337, 21 L.Ed.2d 301 (1968).\nFor the reasons stated, we hold that when a contract calls for \u201cdisinterested\u201d arbitrators, prior representation of one of the parties by a designated arbitrator will disqualify that arbitrator upon objection of the opposing party.\nNationwide claims that the award of the arbitrators should be confirmed because the limited scope of review requires such a result. We do not agree. As previously mentioned, a common law arbitration award can be vacated if a party is denied a hearing. See Fioravanti, supra. In Smaligo v. Fireman\u2019s F. Ins. Co., 432 Pa. 133, 247 A.2d 577 (1968), we held that a party is entitled to a \u201cfull and fair\u201d hearing. Appellee\u2019s position is that arbitrator Brueck\u2019s refusal to disqualify himself because of past representation of Nationwide amounted to denial of a fair hearing. As we believe Mr. Brueck should have disqualified himself in light of the contract calling for disinterested arbitrators, failure to do so under these circumstances is a denial of a fair hearing.\nNationwide next argues that Bole, by proceeding with the hearing, has waived any argument concerning Mr. Brueck\u2019s past representation. We do not agree. Appellant, in effect, argues that appellee should have attempted to enjoin the arbitration. In Lincoln Sys. of Ed. v. Lincoln Ass\u2019n of Univ. Profs., 467 Pa. 112, 119, 354 A.2d 576, 580 (1976), we stated:\n\u201cWhenever one party to an agreement seeks to enjoin the other from proceeding to arbitration, judicial inquiry is limited to two questions: (1) was an agreement to arbitrate entered into; and (2) does the dispute involved fall within the arbitration clause. . . . \u201d\nIn the instant case, appellee would not have been able to enjoin the proceedings as an agreement to arbitrate was clearly entered into and the instant dispute was within the arbitration clause.\nOrder of the Superior Court is vacated and case remanded to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nROBERTS, J., files a Dissenting Opinion in which NIX, J., joins.\n. Appellee\u2019s hospital bill alone was approximately $15,000. Because of brain damage and the loss of an eye, appellee has been unable to return to work.\n. In light of the contract provision calling for disinterested arbitrators, we agree with Judge Van der Voort\u2019s statement. If a contract calling for commonlaw arbitration allowed the selection of partisan arbitrators, the above-quoted statement would not then be applicable.\n. This opinion in no way is meant to attack the personal or professional integrity of Mr. Brueck, a past president of the Allegheny County Bar Association."}
