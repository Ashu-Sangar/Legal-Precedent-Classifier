{"id": "981763", "contents": "Pee Ctjbiam,\nWe think the court below was right in entering judgment for the defendant upon the facts as set forth in the case stated. We do not think the act of June 8,1881, in regard to the practitioners in the practice of medicine and surgery, repeals the 4th section of the act of March 24,1877. The latter is not inconsistent with the act of 1881, which is but supplementary to the act of 1877, and it is therefore not repealed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
