Chapman Township, 559 Pa. 630, 741 A.2d 1272 (1999) (holding that there is no statutory right to jury trial under Pennsylvania Human Relations Act where statutory language speaks in terms of what \u201cthe court finds\u201d and remedial action \u201cthe court\u201d may take, where nothing in the legislative history indicated an intent to provide the right to a jury trial). If the Superior Court finds that the statute does not create a right to a jury trial in light of Wertz, it shall address respondents\u2019 alternative state constitutional argument. See Wertz, supra, at 1277-79 (setting forth constitutional analysis)."}
