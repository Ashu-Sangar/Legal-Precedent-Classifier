{"id": "1759146", "contents": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM:\nThe Court of Common Pleas of Carbon County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, after an evidentiary hearing, concluded that V.A.C.S., natural mother of D.G.C., had continuously failed to perform her parental duties in respect to her son for a period in excess of six months, and entered a decree involuntarily terminating the parental rights of V.A.C.S. in D.G.C. and awarding custody to the child\u2019s father. See Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, art. III, \u00a7 311, 1 P.S. \u00a7 311 (Supp.1978). V.A.C.S. filed this appeal.\nAppellant contends that, during the many months she was admittedly away from her son, she made \u201csuitable arrangements\u201d for his temporary care by leaving him in the custody of the natural father. See In re Lutheran Children and Family Service of Eastern Pennsylvania, 456 Pa. 429, 321 A.2d 618 (1974). The trial court rejected this version and stated that \u201cat no time,\u201d during the relevant period, did Y.A.C.S. \u201cperform a single parental duty . . . or in any fashion indicate by any act on her part a desire or intent to do so.\u201d\nThe testimony is sufficient to support the court\u2019s findings and conclusions.\nDecree affirmed. Each side to pay own costs.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case."}
