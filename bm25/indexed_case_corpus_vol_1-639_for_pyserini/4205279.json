{"id": "4205279", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nShawn Walker appeals from the order dismissing his claim for guilt phase relief in the form of a new trial, pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. We affirm.\nOn April 23,1991, appellant forcibly entered the home of his former girlfriend, Lisa Johnson, shot and killed a man sleeping on the couch, and shot and permanently disabled Ms. Johnson. The man sleeping on the couch was Ricardo Thomas, a friend of Ms. Johnson\u2019s, who offered to spend the night at her home; Ms. Johnson was fearful because appellant had struck her in the face earlier that day when she refused to have sex with him, and then he harassed her by phone all evening, demanding to speak with her new boyfriend, Tracy \u201cDenzell\u201d Brown. When Mr. Brown left Ms. Johnson\u2019s home in the middle of the night, he noticed a car parked around the block, later identified as appellant\u2019s car. After waiting in his car for about an hour, appellant broke into Ms. Johnson\u2019s home and shot her and Mr. Thomas.\nAppellant then took numerous pills and admitted himself to the hospital for stomach pain. After appellant was treated and about to be discharged, police spoke with him, told him they wanted to question him regarding the shooting, and asked him if he would come to headquarters, emphasizing that he was not required to come with them. Appellant agreed to go with the officers, and was transported to the station without handcuffs. At the station, after waiving his rights, appellant confessed he had broken in and shot the victims, neither of whom were armed; however, at trial, he claimed self-defense, testifying that when he entered Ms. Johnson\u2019s home, \u201cher and some guy was on the couch, they was hugged up.\u201d N.T. Trial, 3/2/92, at 29. Appellant claimed that as he turned to leave, the man got up, punched him, and reached for a gun in his waistband, so appellant reached for his own gun and shot him in self-defense. According to appellant, the police fabricated the portions of his statement that were contradicted by his trial testimony. Id., at 41-44.\nThe jury convicted appellant of first degree murder. At the penalty phase, the jury found two aggravating factors: in the commission of the offense appellant knowingly created a grave risk of death to another person in addition to the victim, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(7); and appellant committed the killing while perpetrating the felony of criminal trespass, id., \u00a7 9711(d)(6). The sole mitigating circumstance the jury found was that appellant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance, id., \u00a7 9711(e)(2). Finding the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstance, the jury sentenced appellant to death.\nAppellant received new counsel and filed a direct appeal, claiming, inter alia, the killing constituted, at most, voluntary manslaughter because he killed the victim in the heat of passion; the verdict was against the weight of the evidence because the Commonwealth failed to prove appellant possessed malice or specific intent to kill because the killing resulted from his mistaken belief he was defending himself; and trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to evidence of appellant\u2019s prior bad acts. This Court affirmed, finding appellant\u2019s claims meritless, Commonwealth v. Walker, 540 Pa. 80, 656 A.2d 90 (1995), and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. Walker v. Pennsylvania, 516 U.S. 854, 116 S.Ct. 156, 133 L.Ed.2d 100 (1995).\nAppellant filed a timely pro se PCRA petition and received new counsel, who filed an amended petition, raising numerous claims of trial court error and trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. The PCRA court granted a hearing on the sole issue of whether trial counsel was ineffective at the penalty phase for failing to adequately investigate and present specific mitigation evidence. Before the hearings were concluded, however, the presiding judge died, and the petition was reassigned to another judge. After several appointments of new counsel due to appellant\u2019s repeated expression of dissatisfaction with each attorney, additional hearings were held. The PCRA court concluded appellant\u2019s penalty phase ineffectiveness claim entitled him to relief, and ordered a new penalty phase; the court denied all other relief. Appellant appealed from the denial of his guilt phase claims.\nWe summarize appellant\u2019s issues as follows: (1) whether the Commonwealth violated due process by failing to disclose the victim\u2019s criminal record to the defense; (2) whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence which would have supported appellant\u2019s account of the incident and countered the Commonwealth\u2019s claims; (3) whether the PCRA court should have granted a hearing on appellant\u2019s guilt phase claims; and (4) whether the cumulative effect of these errors entitles appellant to a new trial or an evidentiary hearing.\nIn reviewing the denial of PCRA relief, we examine whether the PCRA court\u2019s determination is supported by the evidence and is free of legal error. Commonwealth v. Williams, 557 Pa. 207, 732 A.2d 1167, 1176 (1999). To be entitled to PCRA relief, appellant must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, his conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the enumerated errors in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2), his claims have not been previously litigated or waived, id., \u00a7 9543(a)(3), and \u201cthe failure to litigate the issue prior to or during trial, during unitary review or on direct appeal could not have been the result of any rational, strategic or tactical decision by counsel.\u201d Id, \u00a7 9543(a)(4). An issue is previously litigated if \u201cthe highest appellate court in which the petitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue____\u201d Id, \u00a7 9544(a)(2).\nFour issues underlying appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claims were raised on direct appeal \u2014 specifically, whether appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the killing reduced the crime to voluntary manslaughter, whether appellant had the requisite malice for first degree murder when he mistakenly believed he was defending himself, whether appellant\u2019s confession should have been suppressed, and whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to evidence of appellant\u2019s prior bad acts. See Walker, at 94-100. However, appellant now alleges trial and appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in connection with investigation of additional facts surrounding these issues; therefore, his issues are distinct from those raised on direct appeal and have not been previously litigated. See Commonwealth v. Collins, 585 Pa. 45, 888 A.2d 564, 569-70, 573 (2005) (term \u201cissue\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 9543(a)(3) and 9544(a)(2) \u201crefers to the discrete legal ground that was forwarded on direct appeal and would have entitled the defendant to relief\u2019; ineffectiveness claims are distinct from claims raised on direct appeal, and must be treated as wholly independent of underlying claim of error).\nRegarding waiver, at the time of appellant\u2019s trial, direct appeal, and PCRA proceedings, he was required to raise claims based on trial counsel\u2019s performance at the first opportunity after he had new counsel. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b); Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687, 695 n. 6 (1977). Having failed to do this on direct appeal, when he was represented by new counsel, appellant\u2019s claims are waived. However, he may still obtain relief if he can show appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. See Commonwealth v. Rush, 576 Pa. 3, 838 A.2d 651, 656 (2003) (citing Commonwealth v. McGill, 574 Pa. 574, 832 A.2d 1014, 1022 (2003) (when court is faced with \u201clayered\u201d ineffectiveness claim, only viable ineffectiveness claim is that related to most recent counsel, appellate counsel)).\nTo preserve a \u201clayered\u201d ineffectiveness claim,\na petitioner must \u201cplead, in his PCRA petition,\u201d that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise all prior counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Additionally, a petitioner must \u201cpresent argument on, i.e. develop each prong of the [Commonwealth v.] Pierce [, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987) ] test\u201d as to appellate counsel\u2019s deficient representation. \u201cThen, and only then, has the petitioner preserved a layered claim of ineffectiveness for the court to review; then, and only then, can the court proceed to determine whether the petitioner has proved his layered claim.\u201d\nId., at 656 (citations and footnote omitted) (emphasis in original); see also McGill, at 1021-23.\nThe \u201cPierce test\u201d requires appellant to prove, with respect to appellate counsel\u2019s performance, that: (1) the underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness has arguable merit; (2) appellate counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to pursue the claim; and (3) appellant was prejudiced by appellate counsel\u2019s deficient performance. See McGill, at 1022-23. Prejudice in the context of ineffective assistance of counsel means there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s error, the outcome of the proceeding would have been different. Commonwealth v. Kimball, 555 Pa. 299, 724 A.2d 326, 332 (1999). This \u201cperformance and prejudice\u201d test was first enunciated in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and was recognized in Pierce as the proper test under the Pennsylvania Constitution. Failure to establish any prong of the test will defeat an ineffectiveness claim. Commonwealth v. Basemore, 560 Pa. 258, 744 A.2d 717, 738 n. 23 (2000) (citing Commonwealth v. Rollins, 558 Pa. 532, 738 A.2d 435, 441 (1999) (ineffectiveness claim may be denied by showing petitioner\u2019s evidence fails to meet any one of test\u2019s three prongs)).\nIn his PCRA petition, appellant pled trial and appellate counsels\u2019 ineffectiveness for failing to investigate and present factual evidence supporting his account of the incident and countering the Commonwealth\u2019s claims. In his appellate brief, he discusses trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness and includes a section alleging appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, citing appellate counsel\u2019s mistaken belief that, at that time, factual or extra-record arguments were to be litigated in PCRA proceedings. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 35-40. Although appellant presents argument on the first two prongs of his claims of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, he fails to specify how the result of his direct appeal would have differed had counsel investigated and presented the extra-record facts appellant now cites.\nAppellant\u2019s brief was filed four years after McGill. In Commonwealth v. Dennis, 597 Pa. 159, 950 A.2d 945 (2008), where the appellant filed his PCRA petition pre-McGill and his appellate brief post-McGill, we stated:\nMcGill ... does not save Appellant from the obligation properly to layer his claims before this Court, or from a failure to plead and prove the ineffectiveness of trial counsel sufficiently under Pierce to satisfy the arguable merit prong for an ineffectiveness claim against appellate counsel, any of which will be fatal to his claims----\nId., at 956. However, we note the continuing difficulties in the transitional period following McGill, as the measures outlined there take hold, slowly and erratically, in the lower courts. Indeed, we are still seeing cases, such as the instant one, where the PCRA filings predated McGill, but the appellate brief was filed post-McGill. We are also seeing post-McGill cases where PCRA courts have failed to allow for amendment, an important safeguard contemplated in the Rules of Criminal Procedure and emphasized in McGill. Given the complexities posed by these layered ineffectiveness claims, we now conclude the better practice is not to reject claims of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness on the grounds of inadequate development in the appellate brief if the deficiencies in the brief mirror those in the PCRA pleadings, unless the PCRA court invoked these deficiencies as the basis for its decision and afforded an opportunity to amend. Accordingly, McGill\u2019s remand procedure will remain an option in cases such as this one, and we will review the underlying claim concerning trial counsel\u2019s stewardship to determine whether remand for further development of the claim pertaining to appellate counsel is required. As held in McGill and Rush, remand is unnecessary where the appellant has not met his burden of proving the underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\nAs discussed below, appellant has not demonstrated his entitlement to relief on any of these underlying claims. Since all of appellant\u2019s underlying claims of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness fail, his claims of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness are necessarily defeated as well, McGill, at 1023, and we need not remand for him to develop the prejudice claim with respect to appellate counsel. See Rush, at 657-58; McGill, at 1026. We now turn to address appellant\u2019s claims.\nDue Process/Brady\nAppellant first claims the Commonwealth violated his due process rights and Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), by withholding the victim\u2019s criminal history from the defense, then making false, misleading statements to the jury regarding the victim\u2019s good character. Appellant argues such evidence would have been helpful to his defense, as it supported his claim that the victim was the aggressor. He contends trial counsel asked the Commonwealth to disclose the victim\u2019s criminal history and was told there was none; however, appellant now contends the victim had an extensive criminal history, citing aggravated assault, simple assault, recklessly endangering another person, and terroristic threats charges, as well as outstanding arrest warrants on those charges. In the alternative, appellant contends counsel was ineffective for relying on the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion there was no record and thus failing to discover these charges. The PCRA court held this issue was meritless, as the victim\u2019s arrest record would have been inadmissible at trial.\nUnder Brady, \u201ca prosecutor has an obligation to disclose all exculpatory information material to the guilt or punishment of an accused, including evidence of an impeachment nature.\u201d Commonwealth v. Spotz, 18 A.3d 244, 275-76 (Pa.2011) (citation omitted). To establish a Brady violation, appellant must demonstrate: the evidence at issue was favorable to him, because it was either exculpatory or could have been used for impeachment; the prosecution either willfully or inadvertently suppressed the evidence; and prejudice ensued. Id., at 276 (citation omitted). \u201cThe evidence at issue must have been \u2018material evidence that deprived the defendant of a fair trial\u2019 ... \u2018Favorable evidence is material ... if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d Id. (citations omitted).\nThe PCRA court based its holding on the fact the victim\u2019s arrest record would have been inadmissible at trial. This Court is currently reviewing the issue of whether Brady\u2019s materiality requirement is satisfied where the undisclosed evidence would not have been admissible at trial. See Commonwealth v. Willis, 600 Pa. 499, 968 A.2d 224, 225 (2009) (per curiam order). However, we need not address the interplay between admissibility and materiality here, or the propriety of the PCRA court\u2019s ruling in this regard, because we conclude appellant has failed to demonstrate the requisite prejudice under Brady.\nViewing all of the evidence presented at trial, we cannot conclude, even if appellant had the purported \u201cbenefit\u201d of the victim\u2019s arrest record to support his self-defense claim and rebut the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged portrayal of the victim as a law-abiding citizen, the outcome of the trial would have differed. There was no question regarding the killer\u2019s identity, as appellant confessed to the crimes. There was evidence the front door\u2019s lock was broken, and that the victim was asleep at the time of the killing. No gun was found on or around the victim, and there was no evidence of a struggle. There was evidence appellant was lying in wait outside the home before he broke in, and he engaged in a pattern of harassment and threats against the victim. Thus, there was overwhelming evidence that the murder was deliberate and premeditated. Appellant fails to show that, had the victim\u2019s arrest record been disclosed to him and admitted at trial, it would have cast enough doubt on the Commonwealth\u2019s case to have resulted in a difference outcome in the guilt phase. As appellant has failed to carry his burden of demonstrating he was prejudiced by the Commonwealth\u2019s actions, this claim fails, and remand for further development of it is unnecessary.\nIneffectiveness of Counsel\nAppellant next raises five ineffectiveness claims, all relating to trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate and present facts which would have supported appellant\u2019s version of the incident, as well as trial counsel\u2019s failure to request a jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter. Appellant argues since he admitted to the crime when he was arrested and at trial, the only issue for the jury was whether the shooting was self-defense, voluntary manslaughter, or murder. He claims trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence in support of his claims that he acted in the heat of passion and in self-defense; he further claims appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise these issues on direct appeal.\nAppellant first asserts trial counsel was ineffective for failing to develop and present evidence to rebut the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that the victim was shot while sleeping, which undermined appellant\u2019s claims of voluntary manslaughter and self-defense. Appellant points to statements given by Commonwealth witnesses to police, wherein the witnesses noted they found the victim sitting up or kneeling on the couch, and indicated the victim threatened appellant shortly before the shooting; he claims trial counsel should have impeached these witnesses at trial with their prior inconsistent statements to police. Appellant further claims trial counsel should have presented expert testimony that the victim\u2019s toxicology report showed he ingested cocaine just prior to his death, demonstrating appellant\u2019s description of the victim\u2019s threatening behavior was consistent with aggressive behavior caused by cocaine use. Appellant also contends trial counsel made statements during closing which conceded the crime was murder because the victim was shot in his sleep.\nViewed in context, the witnesses\u2019 statements in the police reports concerning the position of the victim when he was found would have been of little help to appellant\u2019s defense. Numerous other witnesses, including Ms. Johnson, three police officers, and a crime scene unit employee, testified the victim was lying on the couch; one officer noted he was in a \u201csemi-fetal position.\u201d See N.T. Trial, 2/26/92, at 52; N.T. Trial, 2/27/92, at 117, 136, 148; N.T. Trial, 2/28/92, at 50-52. The medical examiner, who was shown photographs of the victim\u2019s body lying on the couch, testified that based on the trajectory and entrance wounds, the victim was in the position depicted in the photograph when he was shot. See id., at 84-85. Thus, one witness\u2019s statement that the victim was \u201ckneeling\u201d actually corroborated the officer\u2019s testimony; two other witnesses\u2019 statements that the victim was \u201csitting\u201d were insignificant in light of the other overwhelming testimony to the contrary.\nAppellant\u2019s claim concerning the toxicology report showing cocaine metabolites in the victim\u2019s blood is similarly unavailing. At trial, the medical examiner estimated the cocaine in the victim\u2019s blood was ingested approximately a day and a half before his death, see N.T. Trial, 2/28/92, at 87; therefore, introducing expert testimony concerning the toxicology report, which neither stated with certainty the time the victim ingested the cocaine nor verified that he experienced its effects, would not have aided appellant\u2019s defense.\nWith respect to appellant\u2019s claim trial counsel\u2019s summation confirmed the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence that the victim was shot in his sleep, we note appellant focuses on certain phrases in isolation, interpreting them out of context. Trial counsel\u2019s remarks, read as a whole, were a reasonable attempt to discredit the testimony of the only eyewitness and survivor of the shooting, Ms. Johnson, who would have garnered significant sympathy from the jury, given the fact she was in a wheelchair. Counsel attempted to highlight Ms. Johnson\u2019s difficulty in remembering specific details of the crime, pointing out her testimony that the victim was shot in his sleep was suspect because the noise appellant generated by breaking in would have awakened him. See N.T. Trial, 8/3/92, at 23-25. Counsel vigorously singled out the portion of Ms. Johnson\u2019s testimony that did not square with appellant\u2019s account of the events \u2014 that she and the victim slept soundly while appellant broke into the house, shooting them \u2014 and offered the jury a reason to reject the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. The fact this tactic was ultimately unsuccessful does not render trial counsel ineffective; therefore, remand is unnecessary for further development of this claim as it pertains to appellate counsel. See Rush, at 657-58; McGill, at 1026.\nAppellant next claims trial counsel was ineffective for failing to develop and present evidence that would have undermined the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion appellant was lying in wait before the shooting. Tracy Brown testified he left Ms. Johnson\u2019s home around 2:00 a.m. the morning of the murder, and when he circled the block, he saw appellant\u2019s car parked nearby. See N.T. Trial, 2/27/92, at 82-85. However, in his statement to police, Mr. Brown had not mentioned circling the block, and stated Harry Smith accompanied him when he left Ms. Johnson\u2019s home. Appellant argues trial counsel should have impeached Mr. Brown with his police statement, as well as interviewed Mr. Smith to see if his version of events matched Mr. Brown\u2019s. Mr. Smith\u2019s PCRA hearing testimony refuted Mr. Brown\u2019s version of events; Mr. Smith stated they left Ms. Johnson\u2019s home at approximately 10:00 p.m. and did not drive around the block. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 7/24/02, at 11. Appellant further contends trial counsel should have interviewed Ms. Johnson\u2019s next-door neighbor, Vivian Butler, and had her testify; Ms. Butler\u2019s police statement indicated she heard appellant\u2019s car go by Ms. Johnson\u2019s house, not stopping, about 15 minutes before she heard the shots. See Police Interview of Vivian Butler, 4/23/91, at 3-4 (stating she recognized sound of appellant\u2019s car because it \u201cis loud and he keeps the radio up\u201d).\nAppellant fails to demonstrate trial counsel\u2019s actions were unreasonable or that he was prejudiced by not having Mr. Smith and Ms. Butler testify. During Mr. Brown\u2019s cross-examination, trial counsel focused on the fact he did not identify appellant\u2019s car until one week before trial, and emphasized Mr. Brown did not see anyone in the car, nor did he see appellant on the evening in question. See N.T. Trial, 2/27/92, at 86-88. Since Mr. Brown did not realize the significance of the car until one week prior to trial, the fact he neglected to mention it to the police is inconsequential. Likewise, the testimony of a neighbor who was inside her home the entire time in question and simply heard a car go by would have been of dubious value. Mr. Smith\u2019s version of the events on the night of the shooting was inconsistent with appellant\u2019s self-defense claim. Appellant testified he went to Ms. Johnson\u2019s home around 11:30 p.m., after three men (one of whom was Mr. Smith) telephoned him from the home, see N.T. Trial, 3/2/92, at 27; Mr. Smith\u2019s purported testimony was that he and Mr. Brown left the house at 10 p.m., and the victim had not yet arrived. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 7/24/02, at 11. Thus, Mr. Smith\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with appellant\u2019s version of events. Furthermore, although Mr. Smith testified at the PCRA hearing, appellant did not question trial counsel regarding why he did not pursue this purported witness. Accordingly, appellant has failed to demonstrate he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to rebut the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion he was lying in wait, and there is no need to remand for development of this claim concerning appellate counsel. See Rush, at 657-58; McGill, at 1026.\nAppellant next claims trial counsel was ineffective in connection with certain evidence of prior bad acts. He first faults trial counsel for failing to investigate the veracity of the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that appellant tried to steal the minister\u2019s car at Ms. Johnson\u2019s grandmother\u2019s funeral. See N.T. Trial, 2/27/92, at 109-10; N.T. Trial, 3/3/92, at 41. The Commonwealth introduced this evidence to show appellant\u2019s pattern of behavior with Ms. Johnson and her family, as part of the events leading up to the murder. See Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2); Commonwealth v. Lark, 518 Pa. 290, 543 A.2d 491, 497 (1988) (evidence of prior bad act admissible where act was part of sequence of events forming history of case and part of its natural development). Appellant contends the minister dispelled this allegation in an interview with PCRA counsel, and had trial counsel conducted a reasonable investigation, he could have presented this \u201chelpful evidence\u201d to the jury. Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 49.\nAppellant fails to demonstrate that, even if trial counsel should be held accountable for failing to present evidence rebutting the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion concerning the attempted theft of the minister\u2019s car, the lack of this evidence prejudiced him. On direct appeal, we addressed appellant\u2019s related claim that trial counsel should have requested a mistrial when the attempted theft was mentioned; we noted trial counsel objected to this evidence, and when the objection was overruled, requested a cautionary instruction. See Walker, at 99. The trial court instructed the jury the only purpose of the testimony about the car incident was to show a pattern of activity by appellant relating to Ms. Johnson and her family; the court told the jury not to conclude appellant was a bad person or committed any other crimes. Id. We concluded the instruction adequately reflected the law, and the jury was presumed to have followed the court\u2019s instruction. Id. (citing Commonwealth v. Tilley, 528 Pa. 125, 595 A.2d 575, 583 (1991)). Thus, we cannot now conclude appellant suffered prejudice as a result of the admission of this evidence.\nAppellant further faults trial counsel for not objecting to testimony by Ms. Johnson\u2019s sister that he \u201cwent to jail\u201d from November, 1990 to February, 1991, see N.T. Trial, 2/27/92, at 6-7, and for compounding this error by eliciting testimony from a police officer that he seized a \u201c[pjarole [department paper\u201d with appellant\u2019s name on it from appellant\u2019s car. See N.T. Trial, 3/2/92, at 12.\nAs the PCRA court noted, the reference to appellant\u2019s previous incarceration was passing in nature, inadvertently related to establishing a time-line of his romantic involvement with Ms. Johnson; thus, it was not elicited to illustrate bad character, and the prosecutor did not attempt to exploit this comment. See PCRA Court Opinion, 6/29/06, at 14. Likewise, the reference to the parole paper in appellant\u2019s car was brief and harmless, introduced to show his connection with the car parked on Ms. Johnson\u2019s street the night of the murder. Thus, appellant fails to show these comments prejudiced him. As these claims regarding trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness fail, remand for further development of them with respect to appellate counsel is unnecessary. See Rush, at 657-58; McGill, at 1026.\nAppellant next argues trial counsel\u2019s lack of preparation for the penalty phase in failing to investigate mental health evidence also affected the guilt phase; had counsel conducted a reasonable investigation, he could have presented viable defenses regarding appellant\u2019s mental state at the time of the crime, which would have reduced the degree of homicide to voluntary manslaughter. Appellant further claims counsel should have requested jury instructions on \u201cheat of passion\u201d voluntary manslaughter, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503(a), and \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d voluntary manslaughter, id., \u00a7 2503(b).\nSpecifically, appellant argues counsel knew or should have known that at the time of the incident, appellant believed the victim was going to harm him, appellant was upset over Ms. Johnson being with another man, and appellant tried to kill himself afterwards; given this information, appellant claims, counsel should have pursued a mental health evaluation. Appellant further argues counsel should have realized evidence of his mental state would help explain the discrepancies between his police statement and his trial testimony. Although counsel told the jury the only real question was whether the crime was first degree murder or a lesser degree of homicide, appellant argues counsel should have requested the appropriate instructions which would have enabled the jury to return a verdict of third degree murder or voluntary manslaughter.\nWith respect to trial counsel\u2019s failure to request jury instructions on \u201cheat of passion\u201d and \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d voluntary manslaughter, we ruled on direct appeal that the evidence presented at trial demonstrated appellant possessed specific intent to kill; he was not acting under sudden, intense passion. Walker, at 96. Alternatively, we held even if he was acting under heat of passion when he harassed Ms. Johnson by phone on the evening of the murder, there was sufficient time for cooling off when appellant waited in his car for an extended period of time before the killing. Id. We also concluded there was no evidence supporting appellant\u2019s claim of self-defense; therefore, we rejected his claim that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence because the killing implicated imperfect self-defense voluntary manslaughter. Id., at 97. In light of these prior holdings, appellant cannot succeed on his claim that trial counsel should have requested a jury charge on heat of passion and imperfect self-defense voluntary manslaughter; the evidence presented did not warrant such instructions. See Commonwealth v. Washington, 547 Pa. 563, 692 A.2d 1024, 1028-29 (1997) (jury instructions regarding particular defense not warranted where evidence does not support such instruction).\nThus, appellant\u2019s argument evolves into an attack on trial counsel\u2019s stewardship for not presenting evidence that would have supported a finding of heat of passion or imperfect self-defense voluntary manslaughter. Appellant claims counsel should have investigated and presented additional evidence of appellant\u2019s state of mind on the night of the killing. Although trial counsel testified at the PCRA hearing that he should have obtained a mental health evaluation of appellant prior to the guilt phase, he also admitted appellant \u201cseemed disinclined\u201d to do so, so he dropped the issue; counsel\u2019s impression was \u201cthat if I did ask an expert to see him that he would not cooperate.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 12/4/03, at 60-61. Counsel conceded that, in his experience as a criminal defense attorney, he did not see a defense of diminished capacity such as would necessitate expert testimony; the defense was that appellant was acting out of a jealous rage at the time of the crime \u2014 a defense laypeople could appreciate without the aid of an expert. See id., at 65.\nIn light of our prior holding on direct appeal that there was enough cooling off time to negate any finding that appellant acted in the heat of passion, we cannot conclude that the result at trial would have been different had counsel presented evidence concerning appellant\u2019s state of mind. Furthermore, regarding imperfect self-defense, it is extremely improbable that expert opinion testimony would have made this claim any more plausible, given the facts surrounding the killing. Appellant\u2019s conduct and supporting testimony did not support either defense; therefore, although trial counsel admittedly could have conducted more investigation in preparing appellant\u2019s defense at the guilt phase, appellant has failed to show the outcome of the trial would have differed had counsel done so. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness fails, and remand for further development of this claim concerning appellate counsel is unnecessary. See Rush, at 657-58; McGill, at 1026.\nAppellant next claims trial counsel was ineffective for failing to argue alternative grounds for suppressing appellant\u2019s statement to police, and after suppression was denied, failing to investigate and present evidence undermining the Commonwealth\u2019s use of the statement at trial. At the suppression hearing, the prosecutor argued appellant voluntarily accompanied police to the station, where he gave his statement; therefore, he was not arrested or in custody when he made the statement. At trial, the prosecutor \u2019 impeached appellant\u2019s testimony with the statement, showing inconsistencies between appellant\u2019s version of the incident in the statement and at trial. Appellant claims counsel should have pursued the issue of whether he was in custody; he argues had counsel investigated the records from the hospital where he was treated for his suicide attempt immediately following the shooting, counsel would have discovered he was actually in custody.\nAppellant\u2019s attempt to revisit the issue of whether his confession should have been suppressed is \u201ca futile exercise in pedantry.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 6/29/06, at 27. The few notations in the hospital report which refer to appellant being in \u201ccustody\u201d are not determinative of the custody issue; the real question is whether appellant was free to leave, and the record reflects he was, and he knew of this fact. See Walker, at 97 (\u201cAfter being informed by the police that he was not required to accompany the officers, appellant freely agreed to do so. Appellant was then taken, without handcuffs, to the homicide unit____\u201d). Appellant, who \u201cnever showed any signs of being under any sort of mind altering substance during his interview[,]\u201d id., at 98, was given Miranda warnings and waived his rights before offering his confession. The finding that appellant was properly advised of his rights and voluntarily waived them precludes appellant\u2019s claim that counsel should have pursued the alternate issue of custody.\nAppellant further argues counsel should have had him undergo a mental health evaluation; this, he claims, would have demonstrated his mental deficits likely caused the inconsistencies between his prior statement and his trial testimony. Appellant relies on the affidavits of two physicians, who opined his psychological and cognitive difficulties adversely affected his information processing ability, memory, self-expression, and reasoning, and that these impairments were intensified under stress, thus explaining why his police statement did not align with his trial testimony. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 17-18 (quoting Affidavit of Dr. Robert Fox, 9/24/96, at 6, \u00b6 16; Affidavit of Dr. Patricia Fleming, 8/17/96, at 6 \u00b6 14).\nAppellant fails to demonstrate that, had trial counsel used this evidence to explain the inconsistencies between his confession and his trial testimony, the result at trial would have differed. Even if trial counsel had produced an expert to persuade the jury that appellant\u2019s mental deficits caused the discrepancies between his prior police statement and his trial testimony, there was overwhelming evidence the killing occurred in a premeditated, deliberate manner. Thus, offering an expert opinion to attempt to diminish the impact of appellant\u2019s inconsistent statement would have had limited value. As appellant has failed to demonstrate he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s actions, remand for development of this claim concerning appellate counsel is unnecessary. See Rush, at 657-58; McGill, at 1026.\nDenial of Guilt Phase Claims Without Evidentiary Hearing\nAppellant next claims the PCRA court erred in denying relief on his guilt phase claims without a hearing; he specifically challenges certain portions of the PCRA court\u2019s reasoning in disposing of these claims. A PCRA petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing as a matter of right, but only where the petition presents genuine issues of material fact. Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(B)(2); Commonwealth v. Harris, 578 Pa. 377, 852 A.2d 1168, 1180 (2004). A PCRA court\u2019s decision denying a claim without a hearing may only be reversed upon a finding of an abuse of discretion. Id.\nAppellant devotes most of his argument to reiterating his challenges to the PCRA court\u2019s rulings on his guilt phase ineffectiveness claims. As determined above, a review of the evidence of record reveals none of these claims entitle him to relief; no further purpose would have been served by a hearing. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(B)(2). Appellant also argues the PCRA judge, who was assigned the case after the initially assigned judge died, erroneously deferred to the first judge\u2019s ruling that a hearing was only appropriate on one of appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claims \u2014 the issue of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to present mental health mitigating evidence at the penalty phase. Appellant suggests the first judge\u2019s ruling, which granted a hearing on one ineffectiveness claim, did not specifically deny a hearing on the other issues; therefore, he asserts, the issue of whether a hearing was required on his remaining claims was still pending before the second PCRA judge. Appellant\u2019s argument is specious; in granting a hearing on one claim, the first judge obviously considered whether a hearing was appropriate on all claims; finding only one claim where there were issues of material fact, he granted a hearing on that claim alone. The judge\u2019s failure to specify a hearing was denied on appellant\u2019s remaining claims, coupled with the judge\u2019s death before the proceedings were concluded, does not give appellant a second bite at the apple; the second judge appropriately resumed the hearings on the penalty phase claim, then issued the final order granting a new penalty phase and denying relief without a hearing on appellant\u2019s other claims. As we perceive no abuse of the PCRA court\u2019s discretion, this claim affords appellant no relief.\nCumulative Effect of Alleged Errors\nFinally, appellant contends the cumulative prejudicial effect of the above alleged errors entitles him to relief. However, we conclude that, even cumulating the claims which we have rejected on grounds of insufficient proof of prejudice, appellant is not entitled to relief. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 600 Pa. 329, 966 A.2d 523, 532 (2009). Accordingly, this claim fails.\nAs appellant has failed to establish that any of his claims entitle him to a new guilt phase, we affirm the PCRA court\u2019s order.\nOrder affirmed; jurisdiction relinquished.\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices BAER, TODD, and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a concurring opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\n. Appellant\u2019s pre-trial motion to suppress this statement on grounds that he lacked capacity to waive his rights was denied. See N.T. Suppression Hearing, 2/24/92, at 26.\n. Trial counsel presented evidence in support of the following additional mitigating circumstances: appellant's age (20 years old) at the time of the offense, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(4); and appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions, id., \u00a7 9711(e)(1). The jury did not find these were established by a preponderance of the evidence. See id., \u00a7 9711 (c)( 1 )(iii).\n. The Commonwealth cross-appealed from the grant of penalty phase relief; however, it filed a praecipe to discontinue its appeal, which was granted May 15, 2007.\n. Specifically, appellant cites evidence that: the victim had a criminal history, contrary to the Commonwealth's portrayal of him as a decent, law-abiding citizen; the victim was not sleeping when he was shop-appellant was not \"lying in wait\u201d prior to the shooting; appellant did not actually attempt to steal Ms. Johnson\u2019s pastor's car, as the Commonwealth's evidence suggested; appellant lacked the requisite mental state for first degree murder; and appellant's mental state at the time of his confession provided an alternate basis for suppressing it, and the confession was the fruit of an unlawful arrest.\n. Appellant\u2019s claim regarding prior bad acts on direct appeal was that trial counsel should have requested a mistrial when these acts were mentioned; his current claim is that counsel should have presented evidence rebutting the testimony concerning one of these acts. Therefore, it is not previously litigated.\n. Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726 (2002), abrogated Hubbard's rule that ineffectiveness claims based on trial counsel\u2019s performance must be raised at the first opportunity where a defendant has new counsel, and instead held a defendant \"should wait to raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel until collateral review.\u201d Grant, at 738. Appellant\u2019s PCRA proceedings, however, predated Grant, and Hubbard still applied.\n. This prong requires appellant to establish each Pierce prong with respect to trial counsel\u2019s performance, which must be addressed in order to determine whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. See Rush, at 656.\n. Appellate counsel testified that because Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 554 Pa. 31, 720 A.2d 693, 700 (1998) (eliminating relaxed waiver in post-conviction context), was not decided until after appellant's direct appeal, he believed, under the doctrine of \"relaxed waiver,\u201d these issues would not be waived and could be reviewed when appellant filed a PCRA petition. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 7/24/02, at 19-20, 39, 41-42, 48.\nThus, appellant argues appellate counsel\u2019s failure to investigate or research appellant\u2019s mental health history, life history, guilt phase defenses, criminal history of the victim, or the related ineffectiveness of trial counsel was the result of his reliance on relaxed waiver. Appellant contends either counsel\u2019s reliance on relaxed waiver was unreasonable, or this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Ford, 570 Pa. 378, 809 A.2d 325 (2002), which determined Albrecht applied retroactively, renders counsel\u2019s inaction unreasonable by operation of law.\nThis Court did not apply relaxed waiver to capital PCRA appeals until Commonwealth v. DeHart, 539 Pa. 5, 650 A.2d 38, 48 (1994), which was decided November 22, 1994. Appellate counsel\u2019s brief in the present matter was filed March 14, 1994, and the case was argued October 18, 1994, prior to the decision in DeHart. Therefore, counsel cannot reasonably have relied on the established discretionaiy availability of PCRA relaxed waiver review when he declined to pursue extra-record claims in appellant\u2019s direct appeal.\nHowever, prior to DeHart, this Court reviewed waived claims in first PCRA petitions if the petitioner could demonstrate \u201cextraordinary circumstances.\u201d This exception was derived from the language of the Post Conviction Hearing Act (PCHA), the PCRA\u2019s predecessor, which provided an ineffectiveness claim could be raised where the petitioner was \u201cable to prove the existence of other 'extraordinary circumstances\u2019 justifying his failure to raise the issue.\u201d 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180 \u2014 4(b)(2) (repealed). Under that provision, this Court concluded \u201c[t]he allegation that all counsel below and on prior appeals or P.C.H.A. petitions were ineffective constitutes \u2018extraordinary circumstances.' \" Commonwealth v. McNeal, 493 Pa. 395, 426 A.2d 606, 608 n. 2 (1981). See also Commonwealth v. Nole, 506 Pa. 432, 485 A.2d 766, 768 (1984) (under Commonwealth v. Watlington, 491 Pa. 241, 420 A.2d 431 (1980), to obtain review of any allegation of trial or pre-trial error, PCHA petitioner need only allege all preceding counsel were ineffective in failing to effectively preserve issue for appellate review; such allegation constitutes \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d under PCHA); Commonwealth v. Sullivan, 472 Pa. 129, 371 A.2d 468, 495 n. 15 (1977).\nThus, appellate counsel in the present case could have believed any extra-record claims he did not raise on direct appeal would be available as PCRA claims of prior counsels\u2019 ineffectiveness (including his own), which amounted to \"extraordinary circumstances\u201d justifying their review. However, we cannot definitively conclude, based on the record below, that counsel\u2019s decision to. forego raising extra-record claims was based on this line of cases and thus was reasonable. Regardless of the reasonableness of appellate counsel\u2019s decision, we conclude he was not ineffective for failing to raise baseless claims pertaining to trial counsel's stewardship, as discussed infra.\n. At the time of the shooting, the victim had not been convicted of any of these charges.\n. The PCRA court also noted the victim\u2019s criminal history was a matter of public record and thus available to the defense. See PCRA Court Opinion, 6/29/06, at 23-24 n. 6; see also Spotz, at 276 (\"There is no Brady violation when the appellant knew or, with reasonable diligence, could have uncovered the evidence in question....\u201d); Collins, at 578 (no due process violation where parties had equal access to information or if defendant could have uncovered such information with reasonable diligence). However, appellant contends he relied on the Commonwealth's assertions, in response to his specific request for the victim's criminal record, that the victim had no record; he contends counsel is entitled to rely upon affirmative representations by the Commonwealth that are made in response to specific defense requests. See Banks v. Dretke, 540 U.S. 668, 693-96, 124 S.Ct. 1256, 157 L.Ed.2d 1166 (2004) (when defense requests information and prosecution does not provide it, defense cannot be faulted for relying on prosecution and assuming no such evidence exists).\nThe Commonwealth counters that, after the PCRA hearing, it found a discovery letter to trial counsel, dated January 6, 1992, indicating it in fact provided the victim\u2019s criminal history to the defense. The Commonwealth has moved to submit the letter to this Court to correct the record pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1926. It also asserts it would not oppose a limited remand to permit the PCRA court to consider the letter, which casts doubt on the accuracy of trial counsel's recollection that it was his impression the prosecutor told him the victim had no record.\nHowever, even if appellant\u2019s assertion concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s representation is true, he is not entitled to relief because he has failed to show the requisite prejudice under Brady. Accordingly, while we do not condone such practices by the Commonwealth, we need not supplement the record with the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered letter nor remand to address this factual dispute. Furthermore, regarding appellant's claim that trial counsel was ineffective for relying on the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged assertion and thus failing to discover the victim\u2019s record, we again note appellant\u2019s failure to demonstrate the requisite prejudice under Brady precludes relief on his ineffectiveness claim; appellant cannot demonstrate that but for counsel\u2019s inaction, the result at trial would have differed. See Kimball, at 332.\n. See Police Interview of Leon McKnight, 4/23/91, at 5.\n. See Police Interview of Gladys McKnight, 4/23/91, at 3; Police Interview of Sharon Butler, 4/24/91, at 2. Although Gladys McKnight used the term \"sitting\u201d in her description, she clarified the victim's body was actually in more of a fetal position. See Police Interview of Gladys McRnight, 4/23/91, at 3.\n. Likewise, the police statement by Tracy Brown, Ms. Johnson\u2019s boyfriend, that Ms. Johnson told him appellant and the victim \"had threatened to kill each other,\u201d Police Interview of Tracy Brown, 4/23/91, at 5, and Ms. Johnson\u2019s father\u2019s police statement that the victim \u201duse[d] to tell [appellant] if he wanted to fight [he] would meet [him,]\u201d Police Interview of Leon McKnight, 4/23/91, at 8, were contrary to appellant\u2019s contention that he and the victim had never met or only knew each other peripherally through others; thus, such statements would not have been helpful to the defense.\n. Appellant cites the following remarks: \"[Ms. Johnson] says she woke up to [appellant] shooting [the victim], that [the victim] didn\u2019t move but was shot down as he slept and in that testimony is the essence of murder....\u201d N.T. Trial, 3/3/92, at 24 (emphasis added); \"The question arises as to why the door being kicked open didn't wake [the victim], as to whether or not they had consumed alcohol or drugs and therefore were stuporous [,]\u201d id. (emphasis added); and counsel\u2019s asking the jury to consider appellant\u2019s actions \u201cafter the murder____\u201d Id., at 27-28.\n. Also unsuccessful was counsel\u2019s attempt to highlight appellant\u2019s remorse and concern by mentioning his suicide attempt \"after the murder.\u201d N.T. Trial, 3/3/92, at 27-28. This inadvertent reference to the shooting as \"murder\u201d was just that \u2014 inadvertent\u2014and appellant's contention it constituted concession to the crime is specious.\n. Mr. Brown explained he did not recognize the car at the time he saw it, but when he was shown a photograph of it one week before trial, in preparation for his testimony, he recalled seeing it on the night of the murder. See N.T. Trial, 2/27/92, at 83-84.\n. To the extent appellant's claim concerning the minister\u2019s denial of the incident falls under the appellation of after-discovered evidence or failure to call a witness, it likewise fails. See Commonwealth v. Randolph, 582 Pa. 576, 873 A.2d 1277, 1283 (2005) (criteria for relief on after-discovered evidence claim); Commonwealth v. Bomar, 573 Pa. 426, 826 A.2d 831, 856 (2003) (criteria for relief on claim of ineffectiveness for failure to call witness). Appellant offers nothing other than his bald assertion that the minister would have testified on his behalf at trial, and as discussed supra, fails to demonstrate the absence of such testimony prejudiced his case.\n. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 54 (quoting Commonwealth\u2019s Exhibit 2, Medical College of Pennsylvania Records Psychiatric Emergency Service Data Summary Sheet, 4/23/91, at 3) (\"[Patient] was ... released into custody of Detective Sergeant Descher....\u201d); id.., at 6 (\"Released into custody of homicide detective ... \u201d); id., at 9 (\"Discharged to police custody ...\u201d). The hospital records also state, however, that \"[Patient] went with police voluntarily, [according] to them.\u201d Id., at 6.\n. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966)."}
