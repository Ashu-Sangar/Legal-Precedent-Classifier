{"id": "1275657", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Arnold,\nIn this action of assumpsit (sounding in tort) the jury returned a verdict for defendant and the court entered judgment thereon after refusal of plaintiff\u2019s motion for new trial. One of court en banc having died before the opinion was rendered, the judgment was set aside and a reargument had. New trial was then awarded, and defendant now appeals. The award of new trial was on the ground that \u201cthe ends of justice require that this case be tried a second time\u201d; although the court observed in its opinion that \u201cWe also believe, which we agree is nothing but dictum, that the verdict of the jury was capricious.\u201d\nThe only evidence was that of plaintiff; but the verdict was for the defendant. From an examination of the record, we conclude that the action of the court below in awarding a new trial must be held to be an abuse of its discretion.\n\u201cWhere the reason assigned for the grant, of a new trial involves the exercise of discretion, ordinarily the order of the trial court will not be interfered with, in the absence of palpable abuse of power: Class & Nacliod Brewing Co. v. Giacobello, 277 Pa. 530, 121 A. 333, cited with approval in Belletiere v. Philadelphia, supra. But as stated by Chief Justice Maxey in Jones v. Williams et ah, 358 Pa. 559, 58 A. 2d 57, p. 564: While this Court usually supports the action of the trial court in granting or refusing a new trial we do not entirely abdicate our reviewing functions in such cases. This Court, too, has the duty to determine from the record whether or not the jury\u2019s verdict was so contrary to the evidence as to shock one\u2019s sense of justice and to make the award of a new trial imperative so that right may be given another opportunity to prevail.\u2019 This quotation was repeated with approval in Decker v. Kulesza, 369 Pa. 259, 263, 85 A. 2d 413____\n\u201cIt is only where such discretion has been exercised capriciously, arbitrarily, improvidently or has been palpably abused that we will reverse. A trial court, however, must give reasons for its action, otherwise an appellate court would be unable to review such action. Mere conclusions such as \u2018interests of justice\u2019 are insufficient. All judicial process necessarily is in the interest of justice. Such conclusion, in the absence of amplification, could well, serve as a cloak or shield for abused judicial discretion.\n\u201cSince the learned court below in the present case failed to give its reasons for granting defendant\u2019s motion for new trial, stating only its conclusion that \u2018the interests of justice require a retrial\u2019, we are obliged to examine the entire record to determine whether any valid reason exists for disturbing the jury\u2019s verdict: Belletiere v. Philadelphia, 367 Pa. 638, 81 A. 2d 857; Carroll v. Pittsburgh, 368 Pa. 436, 84 A. 2d 505; Decker v. Kulesza, 369 Pa. 259, 85 A. 2d 413.\u201d Beal v. Reading Company, 370 Pa. 45, 48, 49, 87 A. 2d 214.\nThe issue was purely one of fact, and was for the jury alone to determine. We cannot say that its finding was capricious; but that it was supportable by the evidence, and should be upheld. Merely because this Court, or the court below, might have found differently is not sufficient for disregarding the jury\u2019s action. The case, as will be shown, was fairly tried, and the jury properly left to its own conclusion.\nUnder written contract therefor, defendant was engaged in removing cork-covered steel tanks from plaintiff\u2019s building. To do so it was necessary to cut the tanks through the use of acetylene torches. The work was begun in February, 1952, and continued until a fire destroyed the building on April 4, 1952. All evidence as to cause of the fire was oral, and circumstantial, but plaintiff contended and sought to prove that it resulted from defendant\u2019s negligence. Although the fire started in the room where defendant had been working, the last time that that work was done in the area of origin of the fire was two days before the fire occurred. Plaintiff offered proof that cork was of such composition that, ignited, it would smolder for long periods before bursting into flame. The testimony also brought out the fact, that contained in the same room was other equipment of plaintiff, in use and supervised by plaintiff. There was no proof of improper use of the acetylene torches, but plaintiff sought to establish that defendant did not use proper precautions to avoid fire.\nIn support of its motion for new trial, plaintiff contended that the court erred in its charge on circumstantial evidence and in rejecting proof of similar occurrences in defendant\u2019s past work, as well as a proposal which preceded execution of the contract. It further contended that exclusive control was in defendant, which did not meet the burden of exculpating itself from fault.\nWe declared in Connor v. Hawk, 387 Pa. 480, 482, 483, 128 A. 2d 566: \u201cTo establish negligence by circumstantial evidence, the circumstances must be \u2018 \u201c so strong as to preclude the possibility of injury in any other way and provide as the only reasonable inference the conclusion\u201d that the [accident] was caused by the negligence of defendant in the manner alleged\u2019 \u201d. . . . This was modified by the declaration that \u201cit is sufficient if the evidence satisfies reasonable and well balanced minds that defendant\u2019s negligence was the cause.\u201d In its charge in this respect, the court below was definitely not in error. To the contrary, its charge was almost verbatim as stated in Connor v. Hawk, supra. The evidence here was definitely not sufficient to preclude that the fire resulted from a cause other than defendant\u2019s acts; nor does the evidence satisfy a reasonable mind that defendant caused it.\nPlaintiff\u2019s next complaint was that the trial judge improperly excluded proof that fires had occurred on other, unconnected, jobs of defendant. But, there was no testimony of similarity nor of causation. The fires could have been created by causes wholly foreign to the one plaintiff sought to establish, and would have presented to the jury \u201ca multitude of collateral inquiries, calculated to confuse and embarrass them\u201d: See Fer reira v. Wilson Borough, 344 Pa. 567, 26 A. 2d 342. We conclude, upon review of the testimony in this case, that the court was well within its right in excluding the testimony as to other occurrences disassociated from the instant inquiry.\nA proposal made prior to execution of the contract provided that \u201cextreme care and caution to be exercised at all times by each employee and constant supervision by competent person or persons of Bennett Bros. Inc. [would be supplied].\u201d The court below correctly excluded it, as well as proof that defendant had provided a night watchman in the early stages of the work. Not only was all testimony in respect to the work and its supervision admitted, but the proposal must be taken to have been superseded by the contract: Buffington v. Buffington, 378 Pa. 149, 106 A. 2d 229. There was no testimony to establish improper supervision, nor that a night watchman was necessary or was required by the contract governing the parties. Further, the jury was warranted in finding that the premises were not under the exclusive control of defendant, and that the fire did not start as a result of any action of defendant. The cause, under all the circumstances of this case, could have been from a number of factors other than defendant\u2019s acts \u2014 at least, the issue' was for determination by the jury alone, and its verdict should not be disturbed.\nWe must conclude that the action of the court below was a palpable abuse of its discretion, the finding of the jury as to cause not having been against the weight of the evidence but supported by it; and \u201cthe ends of justice [do not] require that this case be tried a second time.\u201d\nOrder granting new trial reversed; and judgment entered for defendant.\nThe charge, inter alia, was: \u201cCircumstantial evidence, to warrant a verdict, must be so strong as to preclude tlxe possibility of injury in any other way, and provide as the only reasonable inference the conclusion for which the contention is made . . . Since proof to a degree of absolute certainty is rarely obtainable in any alleged factual controversy, the law requires only that the evidence as to the operative cause of the accident be enough to satisfy reasonable and well balanced minds that it is the one on which the plaintiff relies ... It is not the rule that circumstantial evidence to establish negligence need exclude everything that the ingenuity of counsel may suggest as having possibly caused or contributed to. the injuries or death.\u201d"}
