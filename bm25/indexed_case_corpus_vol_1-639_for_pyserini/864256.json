{"id": "864256", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe have considered the testimony, of which the compulsory nonsuit in this case is predicated, and are satisfied that the learned trial judge rightly held it was insufficient to justify submission of the case to the jury. There is no such evidence of fraud as would warrant any trial court in sustaining a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs. That, being so, there was no error in entering the judgment of nonsuit, and afterwards refusing to take it off.\nJudgment affirmed."}
