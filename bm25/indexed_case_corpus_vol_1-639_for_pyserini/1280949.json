{"id": "1280949", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nVasil Pavlinko died February 8, 1957; his wife, Hellen, died October 15, 1951. A testamentary writing dated March 9, 1949, which purported to be the will of Hellen Pavlinko, was signed by Vasil Pavlinko, her husband. The residuary legatee named therein, a brother of Hellen, offered the writing for probate as the will of Vasil Pavlinko, but probate was refused. The orphans\u2019 court, after hearing and argument, affirmed the decision of the register of wills.\nThe facts are unusual and the result very unfortunate. Vasil Pavlinko and Hellen, his wife, retained a lawyer to draw their wills and wished to leave their property to each other. By mistake Hellen signed the will which was prepared for her husband, and. Vasil signed the will which was prepared for his wife, ehch instrument being signed at the end thereof. The lawyer who drew the will and his secretary, Dorothy Zinkham, both signed as witnesses. Miss Zinkham admitted that she was unable to speak the language of Vasil and Hellen, and that no conversation took place between them. The wills were kept by Vasil and Hellen. For some undisclosed reason, Hellen\u2019s will was never offered for probate at her death] in this case it was offered merely as an exhibit.\nThe instrument which was offered for probate was short. It stated:\n\u201cI, Hellen Pavlinko, of . . ., do hereby make, publish and . declare this to .be my Last Will and Testament, . . .\u201d\nIn the first paragraph she directed her executor to pay her debts and funeral expenses. In the second paragraph she gave her entire residuary estate to \u201cmy husband, Vasil Pavlinko . . . absolutely\u201d.\nShe then provided: \u201cThird: If my aforesaid husband, Vasil Pavlinko, should predecease me, then and in that event, I give and bequeath: (a) To my brother-in-law, Mike Pavlinko, of McKees Bocks, Pennsylvania, the sum of Two hundred ($200.00) Dollars, (b) To my sister-in-law, Maria Gerber, (nee Pavlinko), of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the sum of Two hundred ($200.00) Dollars, (c) The rest, residue and remainder of my estate, of whatsoever kind and nature and wheresoever situate, I give, devise and bequeath, absolutely, to my brother, Elias Martin, now residing at 520 Aidyl Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n\u201cI do hereby nominate, constitute and appoint my husband, Vasil Pavlinko, as Executor of this my Last Will and Testament.\u201d It was then mistakenly signed: \u201cVasil Pavlinko [Seal]\u201d.\nWhile no attempt was made to probate, as Vasil\u2019s will, the writing which purported to be his will but was signed by Hellen, it could not have been probated as Vasil\u2019s will, because it was not signed by him at the end thereof.\nThe Wills Act of 1947 provides in clear, plain and unmistakable language in \u00a72: \u201cEvery will shall be in writing and shall be signed by the testator at the end thereof\u201d with certain exceptions not here relevant. The court below correctly held that the paper which recited that it was the will of Hellen Pavlinko and intended and purported to give Hellen\u2019s estate to her husband, could not be probated as the will of Vasil and was a nullity.\nIn order to decide in favor of the residuary legatee, almost the entire will would have to be rewritten. The court would have to substitute the words \u201cVasil Pavlinko\u201d for \u201cHellen Pavlinko\u201d and the words \u201cmy wife\u201d wherever the words \u201cmy husband\u201d appear in the will, and the relationship of the contingent residuary legatees would likewise have to be changed. To consider this paper \u2014 as written \u2014 as Vasil\u2019s will, it would give his entire residuary estate to \u201cmy husband, Vasil Pavlinko, absolutely\u201d and \u201cThird: If my husband, Vasil Pavlinko, should predecease me, then ... I give and bequeath my residuary estate to my brother, Elias Martin.\u201d The language of this writing, which is signed at the end thereof by Vasil Pavlinko, is unambiguous, clear and unmistakable, and it is obvious that it is a meaningless nullity.\nWhile no authority is needed to demonstrate what is so obvious, there is a case which is directly in point and holds that such a writing cannot be probated as the will of Vasil Pavlinko. This exact situation arose in Alter's Appeal, 67 Pa. 341. The facts are recited in the unanimous opinion of the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Agnew (page 344) : \u201cThis is a hard case, but it seems to be without a remedy. An aged couple, husband and wife, having no lineal descendants, and each owning property, determined to make their wills in favor of each other, so that the survivor should have all they possessed. Their wills were drawn precisely alike, mutatis mutandis, and laid down on a table for execution. Each signed a paper, which was duly witnessed by three subscribing witnesses, and the papers were enclosed in separate envelopes, endorsed and sealed up. After the death of George A. Alter, the envelopes were opened and it was found that each had by mistake signed the will of the other. To remedy this error the legislature, by an Act approved the 23rd day of February 1870, conferred authority upon the Register\u2019s Court of this county to take proof of the mistake, and proceed as a court of chancery, to reform the will of George A. Alter and decree accordingly. . . . Was the paper signed by George A. Alter his will? Was it capable of being reformed by the Register\u2019s Court? The paper drawn up for his will was not a will in law, for it was not \u2018signed by him at the end thereof,\u2019 as the Wills Act requires. The paper he signed was not his will, for it was drawn tip for the will of his wife and gave the property to himself. It was insensible and absurd. It is clear, therefore, that he had executed no will, and there was nothing to be reformed. There was a mistake, it is true, but that mistake was the same as if he had signed a blank sheet of paper. He had written his name, but not to his will. He had never signed his will, and the signature where it was, was the same as if he had not written it at all. He therefore died intestate, and his property descended as at law.\u201d The Court further decided that the Legislative Act was void because it had no power to divest estates which were already vested at law on the death of George A. Alter without a will.\nHow firmly and without exception the courts have \u2022 carried out the provisions of the Wills Act, when the language thereof is clear and unmistakable, is further evident from the following authorities: Bryen\u2019s Estate, 328 Pa. 122, 195 A. 17; Churchill\u2019s Estate, 260 Pa. 94, 103 A. 533; Gray Will, 365 Pa. 411, 76 A. 2d 169.\nIn Bryen\u2019s Estate, 328 Pa., supra, a testator received from his lawyer a three page will. He wished to add an additional clause providing for a grandchild. The lawyer thereupon rewrote the last page \u201cbacked and bound together with brass eyelets the first, second and new third page, unnumbered, and inserted the original: third page loosely between the last of the fastened pages and the backer.\u201d Bryen executed the loose sheet at the end thereof in the presence of two subscribing witnesses. He then placed the enclosure in his safe deposit box where it was found after his death. The Court held that the instrument could not be probated as Bryen\u2019s last will because it was not signed at the end thereof in conformity with the statute, nor could any part or pages thereof be probated as his last will. This Court, speaking through Mr. Justice, later Chief Justice, Steen, said (page 128) : \u201cThe obvious truth of the matter is that the loose sheet was signed by mistake, .... While decedent\u2019s mistake is regrettable, it cannot be judicially corrected; the situation thus created must be accepted as it exists: Alter\u2019s Appeal, 67 Pa. 341. The question is not what a testator mistakenly thinks he is doing, but what he actually does: Churchill\u2019s Estate, 260 Pa. 94, 100; Dietterich\u2019s Estate, 127 Pa. Superior Ct. 315, 322, 323. It is of paramount importance to uphold the legal requirements as to the execution of wills, so that the possibility of fraud may be reduced to a minimum.\u201d\nIn Churchill\u2019s Estate, 260 Pa. 94, 103 A. 533, the Court refused to probate Churchill\u2019s will, which was written by him. He failed to sign his name \u201cat what was so clearly the end of the paper as a will. What he did do was to write his name in three blank spaces in the paper \u2014 first at the top and then in the testimonium and attestation clauses. ... he said to one of the two attesting witnesses, \u201cIhis is my will, I have signed it,\u2019 and to the other, \u2018I wish you to witness my name to a paper,\u2019 and subsequently handed it to a physician, saying, \u201cThis is my will, and I want you to keep it for me,\u2019 . . .\n\u201cThe decedent may have thought he had made a will, but the statute says he had not. The question is not one of his intention, but of what he actually did, or rather what he failed to do. He failed to sign the paper at the end thereof, and this essential requirement of the statute is not met by the insertion of his name in his own handwriting in three blank spaces in the printed form of the paper which he may have intended to use in executing his will. 'It may happen, even frequently, that genuine wills, namely, wills truly expressing the intentions of the testators, are made without observations of the required forms; and whenever that happens, the genuine intention is frustrated by the act of the legislature, of which the gen\u00e9ral object is to give effect to the intention. The courts must consider that the legislature, having regard to all probable circumstances, has thought it best, and has therefore determined, to run the risk of frustrating the intention sometimes, in preference to the risk of giving effect to or facilitating the formation of spurious wills, by the absence of forms. . . . \u2018Our Act of 1833 as well as the statute of Viet, are in part borrowed from the British statute of frauds, two sections of which have been so evaded by judicial construction as to be practically repealed. We do not propose that the Act of 1833 shall meet with the same fate. The legislature have laid down a rule so plain that it cannot be evaded without a clear violation of its terms. No room is left for judicial construction or interpretation. It says a will must be signed at the end thereof, and that\u2019s the end of it. We are of opinion that this paper was not a will within the meaning of the Act of 1833, and that it was error to admit it to probate.\u2019 \u201d\nIn Gray Will, 365 Pa. 411, 76 A. 2d 169, testatrix signed her will \u201cMrs. Ella X (her mark) Gray. Witness: Fannie Graff.\u201d Mrs. Anderson was also present and saw Mrs. Gray make her mark, but did not sign her name on the paper as a subscribing witness. The Court said (pages 414-415) : \u201cThe first question that arises is, was this writing of January 22, 1946, a will and if so, was it probatable as such? The learned trial judge found and we agree that this writing was testamentary in character: Davis\u2019s Estate, 275 Pa. 126, 118 A. 645; Kimmel\u2019s Estate, 276 Pa. 435, 123 A. 405; Wenz\u2019s Estate, 345 Pa. 393, 29 A. 2d 13. It is however equally clear that even if it be a will, it is not a valid or probatable will. Section 2, sub-section 2 of the Wills Act of April 24,1947, P. L. 89 provides: \u2018If the testator is unable to sign his name for any reason, a will to which he makes his mark and to which. his name is subscribed in his presence before or after he makes his mark, shall be as valid as though he had signed his name thereto: Provided, He makes his mark in the presence of two witnesses who sign their names to the will in his presence\u2019.\u201d\nThis Court held that the instrument did not comply with \u00a72 of the Wills Act of 1947 and could not be probated as Mrs. Gray\u2019s will.\nOnce a court starts to ignore or alter or rewrite or make exceptions to clear, plain and unmistakable provisions of the Wills Act in order to accomplish equity and justice in that particular case, the Wills Act will become a meaningless, although well intentioned, scrap of paper, and the door will be opened wide to countless fraudulent claims which the Act successfully bars.\nDecree affirmed. Each party shall pay their respective costs.\nItalics throughout, ours."}
