{"id": "1834424", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s Order affirming a Bradford County Common Pleas Court\u2019s Order entered March 6,1990, revoking appellant\u2019s parole and ordering him to complete the term of imprisonment imposed on April 3, 1989. On April 3, 1989, appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of forty-five days to twenty-three months and twenty-nine days for pleading guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol. On May 26, 1989, appellant was granted parole and was released from custody on May 30, 1989. One of the conditions of appellant\u2019s parole was that he \u201cabstain absolutely from the use of alcohol....\u201d Parole Order, May 26, 1989.\nOn December 5, 1989, in an unrelated incident, appellant was involved in an altercation which resulted in appellant being shot in the leg by his brother. Appellant was subpoenaed to testify at his brother\u2019s preliminary hearing. When called to testify, appellant initially invoked his right against self-incrimination under the Fifth Amendment. The district attorney offered appellant use immunity in exchange for his testimony. In reliance upon the district attorney\u2019s statements, appellant testified. During the course of his testimony appellant admitted that he had consumed alcohol on the day of the shooting. On December 29, 1989, the Bradford County Probation Office filed a Petition for Reconsideration of Parole, alleging that appellant had been \u201cobserved\u201d consuming alcohol in violation of his parole. On March 6, 1990, a Gagnon II hearing was held. Based upon evidence obtained independently of appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony, appellant\u2019s parole was revoked and he was remanded to the Bradford County Correctional Facility on the original sentence. It is from the Superior Court\u2019s order affirming the Bradford County Common Pleas Court\u2019s order revoking appellant\u2019s parole that appellant now appeals.\nAppellant contends that the trial court erred in revoking his May 26, 1989 parole. Specifically, he claims that the court erred in rejecting his affirmative defense of \u201cestoppel of prosecution.\u201d See, Commonwealth v. Kaye, 232 Pa.Super. 506, 335 A.2d 426 (1975). (Superior Court indicated estoppel of prosecution defense may be recognized in certain situations). Appellant contends that the immunity promised him, albeit defective, should estop the Commonwealth from prosecuting his parole violation. However, we need not decide whether a defective grant of immunity would estop the Commonwealth from prosecuting a parole violation because, in this case, even a perfect grant of immunity would not preclude the Commonwealth from prosecuting appellant with evidence wholly independent of his compelled testimony.\nIt is generally recognized that there are two types of immunity, transactional and use immunity. Transactional immunity precludes prosecution for any transaction concerning which testimony was compelled, regardless of its source. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 507 Pa. 27, 30 n. 3, 487 A.2d 1320, 1321 n. 3 (1985); Riccobene Appeal, 439 Pa. 404, 411-412, 268 A.2d 104, 109 (1970). Use immunity, which is not as broad as transactional immunity, prohibits the use or derivative use of any compelled testimony. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 507 Pa. at 30, 487 A.2d at 1321; Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 92 S.Ct. 1653, 32 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). Use immunity, however, does not prohibit prosecution for all crimes arising out of the transaction testified to, if the evidence is obtained independently of the compelled testimony. Riccobene Appeal, 439 Pa. at 412, 268 A.2d at 109.\nIn Pennsylvania the witness immunity statute provides for only use immunity. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5947. All that the district attorney offered appellant in this case was use immunity. Since use immunity permits prosecution for the same transaction if the evidence is obtained wholly independently of the compelled testimony, the Commonwealth is not barred from prosecuting appellant for his parole violation, because the evidence the Commonwealth presented at appellant\u2019s Gag-non II hearing was not derived directly or indirectly from the immunized testimony or its fruits. In fact, there was no mention of appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony at the Gagnon II hearing. At the Gagnon II hearing, Pennsylvania State Trooper Anthony Morelli testified that while investigating the shooting incident, he observed petitioner consuming alcohol on three occasions on December 5, 1989. (N.T. 3/6/90, p. 4-6). This knowledge of appellant\u2019s parole violation was obtained, not only independently of appellant\u2019s testimony at his brother\u2019s preliminary hearing, but was also obtained prior to the testimony. Appellant cannot now complain that the Commonwealth is estopped, on due process grounds, from prosecuting him with independent evidence, regardless of the fact that he relied upon the district attorney\u2019s promise of immunity, since his purported immunized testimony was not used against him. Appellant is in no worse position now than if he had never testified.\nAccordingly, we find that the appellant\u2019s parole was properly revoked, and affirm the order of the Superior Court.\nNIX, C.J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. The district attorney had no authority to grant appellant immunity. Pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5947, the district attorney must request from the court an order granting immunity. The statute provides in relevant part:\n[A] district attorney may request an immunity order from any judge of a designated court, and that judge shall issue such an order, when in the judgment of the ... district attorney:\n(1) the testimony or other information from a witness may be necessary to the public interest; and\n(2) a witness has refused or is likely to refuse to testify or provide other information on the basis of his privilege against self-incrimination.\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5947(b) (emphasis added).\nIn this case, a request was never made and an order was never issued. Therefore, it was under a defective grant of immunity that appellant testified. See, Commonwealth v. Johnson, 507 Pa. 27, 487 A.2d 1320 (1985).\n. Appellant previously waived a Gagnon I hearing. Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973). In Gagnon, the United States Supreme Court held that due process requires that a probationer, like a parolee, be given a preliminary (Gagnon I) and a final (Gagnon II) hearing prior to revoking probation. See Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972) (regarding parole revocations).\n. Subsequently, appellant petitioned the Common Pleas Court and was again granted parol on May 30, 1990; he was released from custody on June 16, 1990.\n. A tape of the preliminary hearing played at appellant\u2019s Gagnon II hearing, and made a part of the record, demonstrates that the district attorney offered appellant only use immunity. (N.T. 3/6/90, p. 27-28)."}
