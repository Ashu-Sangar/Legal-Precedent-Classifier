{"id": "1176726", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThe appellant, Joe Senauskas, was indicted for the murder of Metro Seminuk. Seminuk and his wife Mary lived in Warren County, Pa. He operated a filling station called the \u201cAir Port Inn\u201d on United States Highway Route No. 6, between Youngsville and Pittsfield and he also conducted there a small grocery store, and sold tobacco and beverages and maintained a room for dancing. About 12:15 a. m. on March 27, 1936, Seminuk, while standing on the driveway beside his gasoline pump, was shot through the heart, dying almost instantly. He was shot four times. On March 31, 1936, Senauskas was arrested by the State Police. At the barracks he admitted complicity in the shooting and showed the officers where the revolver was hidden. On April 5, 1936, he made a complete confession in writing. His fingerprints were found on glasses and beer bottles used by him shortly before the shooting at the Air Port Inn. At the time of the homicide his age was 18 years, four months and six days.\nIn his confession he stated that late in the evening of December 31, 1935, he met at a dance in Corry a man named John Polens who asked him if he knew any \u201cracket people,\u201d and specifically, \u201cany killers\u201d in Cleveland. A little later Polens told him whom he wanted killed and why. Polens said he wanted the man killed because he, Polens, had lost possession of a farm through this man, and also because he had \u201cdefamed him and put the needles to him,\u201d as a result of which Polens, so he claimed, was unable to get a job. A few days later Polens came to see appellant and the latter told him that he had already gotten in touch with the men in Cleveland and that \u201cthey would come and do it\u201d but that they wanted part payment first. Polens then gave appellant $50, but, before doing so, he took him to the Air Port Inn and pointed out Seminuk. On March 26, 1936, Polens drove the defendant to Corry to take an automobile operator\u2019s test for a license. Polens then suggested to Senauskas that they get a car for the latter \u201cto do the job.\u201d They went to Buffalo and rented an automobile. On their return they stopped near Youngsville and Po-lens produced a revolver and they each \u201cshot into the woods just to see how the gun worked.\u201d They then went to Youngsville where Polens bought a half pint of whiskey and gave it to Senauskas. He also gave appellant seventeen dollars \u201cto take the car back with and pay for the use of the car\u201d after the designated victim at the Air Port Inn had been killed. Senauskas said that Po-lens told him \u201cto give him about an hour\u2019s time\u201d to get far enough away so that he could have an alibi. Senauskas states that he finished his half pint of whiskey and then went to the Air Port Inn and asked for \u201cJohn\u201d which was the name by which Polens had designated Seminuk. He was told that \u201cJohn\u201d was not there. He then left and went to Corry Avhere he drank whiskey and beer. Defendant later went to the Garland Inn and reported to Polens that he had been to the Air Port Inn and that the fellOAV was not there. Polens told him to \u201chang around\u201d as the man would be there. He said he drove past the Air Port Inn and then turned around. He stated that the next thing he remembered was when he awoke about 9 a. m., on March 27, 1936. He got into the automobile and went to Garland and made inquiries at Garland as to where Polens lived. The man to whom he made inquiries asked if he, the defendant, was from Warren, remarking that he thought perhaps he had come down to tell Polens \u201cabout the shooting they had at the Air Port Inn.\u201d This man said that someone had shot a man by the name of Metro. Then defendant stated in his confession: \u201cI got scared and figured I shot the wrong man as the man I was to shoot I knew him as John.\u201d He later met Polens, who gave him $30, and assured him that \u201cMetro and John were the same.\u201d Po-lens later handed Senauskas $120 and told him to leave this part of the country.\nSenauskas was called for trial on June 2, 1936. He entered a plea of \u201cnot guilty.\u201d He was represented by Attorney Earle V. MacDonald, now deceased, who had been appointed counsel by the court. On June 2 five jurors had been selected and on the following morning the defendant in open court asked leave to withdraw his plea of \u201cnot guilty\u201d and enter a plea of \u201cguilty.\u201d This was granted and tlie plea entered. The case was continued until June 10,1936, for the purpose of taking testimony to determine the degree and the sentence.\nA hearing was held on June 10th. Defendant\u2019s confession and other evidence were received. The presence of Senauskas at the place of the homicide on March 26, 1936, was established by a witness who had talked with him at that place and had left at about 12 o\u2019clock p. m. When the witness reached a point about 150 feet from the Inn, he saw the deceased and Senauskas come out of the door and walk around back of the car. He said the defendant got into the car and that he heard the deceased say, \u201cShe is full now,\u201d and then he saw him take the gasoline hose, walk behind the car, and hang it up on the pump. The deceased then walked to the left-hand side of the car, and immediately the witness heard \u201cthree or four shots in rapid succession and a scream at the same time.\u201d Immediately \u201cthe car started out very fast, traveling west without any lights.\u201d The witness ran back to the Inn and saw Seminuk lying alongside the driveway. He said: \u201cHe looked as though he was dead.\u201d Another witness also saw the defendant at the Air Port Inn.\nThe evidence conclusively proved the guilt of Senauskas of murder in the first degree, and on June 23, 1936, in the presence of defendant and his counsel, the court so fixed the degree of murder and imposed the death penalty.\nOn June 27, 1936, Attorney MacDonald presented to the court a paper entitled, \u201cMotion for New Trial and Arrest of Judgment.\u201d Permission was asked to withdraw the plea of guilty. No reason of any kind was assigned to support this request. On June 26, 1936, the day before this motion was presented to Judge Arird, Attorney MacDonald presented a petition in the Supreme Court asking leave to withdraw the plea of guilty and for the appointment of another judge to hear the motion for a \u201cnew trial.\u201d This petition was supported by affidavits to the effect that the guilty plea had been \u201ccoerced\u201d in that it was made in response to a promise by Judge Arird that the death penalty would not be imposed. The filing of this petition and the allegations it contained were not made known to Judge Arird, but he learned of it later from the public press.\nOn September 28, 1936, this Court directed Jambs I. Brownson, President Judge of the 27th Judicial District, to proceed to Warren County and dispose of the motion filed in the lower court for a new trial, arrest of judgment and permission to withdraw the plea of guilty, and a little later Judge Brownson was directed to report to this Court with respect to the allegations in the petition filed here to the effect that the defendant had changed his plea to guilty upon assurances from Judge Arird that the death penalty would not be imposed. On August 28, 1936, Attorney MacDonald died, and, on October 6 next, Judge Brownson appointed Attorney Harold S. Hampson counsel for Senauskas.\nOn October 27, 1936, Judge Brownson began a hearing which lasted five days. He then reported to the Supreme Court that the allegations in the petition had not been established and that, on the contrary, the evidence clearly \u201cnegatived the allegations\u201d of any promises made. The Supreme Court on April 12,1937, dismissed the petition. On May 7, 1937, an appeal to this court was taken.\nThere are nine assignments of error. The first assignment is based upon the court\u2019s refusal of defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. This assignment is overruled.\nThe second assignment is as follows: \u201cThe court below erred in talking privately with the State Troopers, Deputy Sheriff, Sheriff, and Warden, and in using the information so obtained in determining the degree of guilt of the accused, without affording the accused the right to meet these parties and to be present when they talked concerning him and to cross-examine them regarding their statements.\u201d This assignment is based on the following excerpt from the opinion of the court finding the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree: \u201cNow I have talked with the State Troopers, and also the Deputy Sheriff, the ones that arrested Senauskas, and there was no question in their minds but that Senauskas was acting perfectly natural. I have also talked with the Sheriff and the Warden. Nothing wrong with Senauskas except he was a little nervous.\u201d It is important to note that the conversations the judge had with these men related to the mental condition of Senauskas, a matter not then nor theretofore raised by appellant or his counsel. The judge\u2019s talk with these officers was on a fact not in issue. Therefore, the judgment of guilty of murder in the first degree could not have been based in any measure on any such conversations. The second assignment of error is therefore without merit and is overruled.\nThe third assignment of error is that \u201cthe court below erred in its opinion and finding that the plea of guilty entered by the defendant included the wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing of Metro Seminuk.\u201d\nWhile it is not true that a plea of guilty of murder means a plea of guilty to a wilful, deliberate and premeditated murder, for such a plea leaves open for judicial determination the degree of guilt, all murder being presumed to be of the second degree, it is obvious in reading the opinion of Judge Ariro in this case that he was familiar with this rule of determination and acted upon it. At the outset he cites the Act of May 14, 1925, P. L. 759, providing, inter alia, as follows: . .In cases of pleas of guilty, the court, where it determines the crime to be murder of the first degree, shall, at its discretion, impose sentence of death or imprisonment for life.\u201d The court then proceeded to review the facts of this case as revealed by defendant\u2019s confession and by witnesses. In the course of his opinion, the Judge said: \u201cSenauskas used a deadly weapon against a vital part of the body, i. e., a shot passed through the heart of Seminuk. Under such circumstances we have a right to presume that malice and intention existed. Senauskas not only had ample time while sitting in this Inn to deliberate and premeditate, but under his own statements the arrangements between him and Polens had been going on for several days, if not weeks.\u201d The conclusion of the court states that \u201cafter the examination of witnesses and hearing had in due form of law . . . it is adjudged and determined that the crime and the degree of the crime whereof the said Joe Senauskas ... is convicted by his own plea of guilty and his confession and testimony taken, is murder in the first degree.\u201d The third assignment of error is overruled.\nThe fourth assignment is that \u201cthe court below erred in finding the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.\u201d It is overruled.\nThe fifth assignment of error is based on the sentence. It is overruled.\nThe sixth assignment is based on the failure of the judge \u201cto ask the defendant, prior to the imposition of sentence, if he had anything to say why sentence of death should not be pronounced against him.\u201d The record shows that after the court announced its decision fixing the degree of murder at first, it asked the defendant, \u201cHave you anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced against you?\u201d Appellant contends that this is error because the question did not contain the words \u201cof death\u201d after the word \u201csentence.\u201d\nBlackstone in Vol. 4, page 376, in referring to this traditional inquiry, states that the prisoner should be asked \u201cif he has anything to say why judgment should not be awarded against him.\u201d In Rizzolo v. Com., 126 Pa. 54, 17 A. 520, before imposing the death sentence on a defendant convicted of murder in the first degree, the prisoner was called to the bar and asked if he had \u201canything to say why sentence should not be pronounced against him.\u201d This was held sufficient to sustain judgment. In that case the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Paxson, said: \u201cAs no sentence was possible but that of death we think there was no omission.\u201d It is true that now when a man is adjudged guilty of murder in the first degree, there remains a choice of two possible sentences to be imposed, these being either death or life imprisonment. However, even under the law as it now stands, we think that when a defendant convicted of murder in the first degree is addressed as was the prisoner in the case at bar, the omission of the words \u201cof death\u201d does not constitute reversible error.\nThe rule of the common law as to the right of the prisoner to be asked whether he had anything to say why judgment should not be awarded against him or, to put it another way, why sentence of death should not be pronounced against him, does not now possess the inflexibility it did in an earlier day. At common law the rule served a purpose that could not be served in any other way. It gave a prisoner in a capital case \u201can opportunity to allege any ground of arrest, or to plead a pardon, if he had obtained one, or to urge any other legal objection to further proceedings against him\u201d: Schwab v. Berggren, 143 U. S. 442, 446. Putting this question to the prisoner gave him his last opportunity to speak to some one with power to save him from his impending doom. To deprive him of this last opportunity was a serious invasion of his rights, for at common law the defendant in cases of felony was not accorded the privilege of counsel nor could he take any appeal to a higher court. A sentence of death in Pennsylvania has no such irrevocability about it as it had at common law. Anything Senauskas could have said before sentence was imposed, he could by himself or his counsel have said since with equal effect, either to Judge Arird, Judge Brown-son, or to this court.\nModern criminal procedure has thus taken away this rule\u2019s raison d\u2019etre, and it is an honored maxim of the law that \u201ccessante ratione legis cessat, et ipsa lex.\u201d However, the practice of propounding to a prisoner in a capital case the above stated question has been long followed and since, as Chief Justice Gibson once said, \u201cforms are deeply seated in the foundations of the law,\u201d careful judges will continue to make in such cases this ancient inquiry in unequivocal language. Failure to do so will constitute reversible error only when it is shown that the prisoner has been thereby prejudiced.\nIn Hamilton v. Com., 16 Pa. 129, 133, the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Chief Justice Gibson, said: \u201cThe premises to found a sentence of death are set forth in 1 Chitty\u2019s Crim. Law 720, and the form of the entire record is given in 4 Black. Com. Ap. 1. . . . \u201d In that case the error alleged was \u201cthe omission to place upon the record the inquiry made of the prisoner after conviction if he knows or hath anything to say for himself why the Commonwealth ought not to proceed to judgment, etc.\u201d This court held that \u201cthere is nothing on the docket to show even that the prisoner was present when he was sentenced, except the supplementary memorandum that 'he was present in court during every stage of the trial, from the time of his arraignment up to the time when the sentence was passed by the honorable Ellis Lewis, president judge of the court, on him.\u2019 \u201d The judgment was reversed and the prisoner discharged. The record in the case at bar presents no such fatal omission.\nIn Gannon v. People, 127 Ill. 507, 21 N. E. 525, the Supreme Court of Illinois held that \u201cwhile it is a better practice to call upon the defendant to say why he should not be sentenced, yet the omission to do so is no ground for reversal in any case. . . . One of the reasons given for the origin of the practice in England is that ... a motion may be made in arrest of judgment. Under our system, the motion in arrest and the motion for new trial are disposed of before the time for the sentence arrives.\u201d In Sarah v. State, 28 Ga. 576, the Supreme Court of Georgia held that the failure to ask the accused \u201cif she had anything to say as to why sentence should not be pronounced was not sucb an irregularity as to entitle tbe accused to a new trial.\u201d There Judge Lumpkin said: \u201cThe ancient practice was for the court to call on the prisoner if he or she had anything to say why sentence should not be passed. It originated at a time when prisoners were not allowed the benefit of counsel, and when the court was counsel for the prisoner, so far as to see that he was deprived of no legal right. Besides, the benefit of clergy was also allowed; and at this stage it was claimed.\u201d The ruling in that case was upheld in Steel v. State, 99 S. E. 305 (Ga.), where the Supreme Court of Georgia, said: \u201cIf the defendant had been deprived of any substantial right by failure of the court to ask the question, or had the court refused to hear from the accused or his counsel on some meritorious objection to his passing sentence, another question might be raised. But that is not this case. On the contrary, a motion in arrest of judgment was made in the case. What more could the question, if asked, have accomplished? The law will not require a vain thing to be done, and will not remand a case where no error or injury has been shown.\u201d The sixth assignment of error is overruled.\nThe seventh assignment is based on the refusal of the court to permit the defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty. In Com. v. Senauskas, 326 Pa. 69, 191 A. 167, this court, in an opinion by the present Chief Justice, reviewed the question of the alleged \u201cbargain\u201d made by the judge not to impose the death penalty in this case. In the opinion appears the following: \u201cIt may be stated generally that for a judge to make a bargain, engagement or promise in advance, of the hearing of a case irrespective of what the evidence might thereafter show the facts to he and as to what judgment he should render therein, would be judicial misconduct.\u201d This court said further: \u201c. . . allegations of such misconduct should be clearly proved to warrant the fastening of discredit upon any judicial officer. In the instant case, as President Judge Brownson found, the evidence negatives the existence of any improper conduct on the part of the presiding judge. A host of witnesses supported Judge Ariro\u2019s assertion that no promise had been made. Indeed, defendant had indicated before the trial that he intended to plead guilty and trust to the leniency of the court. ... If defendant is aggrieved by the action of the Court . . ., the imposition of the death penalty, the overruling of the motion for a new trial or any other matter, order, decree or judgment, he may take an appeal to this court, the only procedure by which this entire record may be removed here and considered. We will consider at that time all matters connected therewith. The testimony which was heard by President Judge Brownson upon the present motion will be considered as part of the record to be reviewed by us.\u201d\nThe burden of proving that Judge Arird made any commitment before the plea of guilty was entered, as to the sentence to be imposed, was not sustained. The presumption is that it was not made. Regardless of the presumption in favor of the regularity and propriety of official conduct, the allegation is prima facie incredible, for there was no motive for such a commitment; the evidence then available showed that the Commonwealth was justified in asking for a conviction of the defendant of the highest degree of murder and for the imposition of the extreme penalty.\nThe only admissible evidence offered to support the burden of proof is the testimony of A. L. Cohen, Polen\u2019s attorney, who testified that he said [addressing Judge Arird at the time of trial]: \u201cI have just talked to Mr. MacDonald and he has told me he is going to enter a plea. Will you give me the same consideration as you do Mr. MacDonald?\u201d The judge replied, according to Mr. Cohen: \u201cI will give you every consideration; of course, I will give you the consideration I will give Mr. MacDonald or anybody else that comes into this court.\u201d Attorney Cohen admitted on cross-examination that Judge Arird made him no promises.\nAttorney MacDonald, now deceased, made an ex-parte affidavit on June 25, 1936, that on June 3rd, Judge Arird sent for him before court opened and promised him on his own volition that \u201cif a plea of guilty was entered [for Senauskas], the penalty would not be the electric chair,\u201d and that the plea of guilty that day entered in open court \u201cwas upon the advice of deponent as counsel upon the representation of the Court that the sentence would not be, in case of first degree murder being found, the electric chair,\u201d and that \u201che communicated the facts relating to the conversation to A. L. Cohen, Esq., who represented John G. Polens.\u201d\nJudge Arird\u2019s version of what happened is that at 9:30 a. m., on the second day of trial, Attorney MacDonald came into his chambers and talked with him in the presence of the court stenographer. The attorney stated that he Avas nervous and wanted the judge to tell him how to proceed with the case. This the judge refused to do. The attorney then said that his client was \u201cclearly guilty\u201d and that he intended to advise him to plead guilty. To this Judge Arird replied that Mr. MacDonald should use his own judgment. \u201cThere was no other discussion of any kind.\u201d Nothing was said as' to the sentence to be imposed. Court was then opened and defendant and his counsel came to the bar. Leave was asked to withdraw the plea of not guilty and to enter a plea of guilty. The court asked the appellant if he desired to withdraw his plea and enter a plea of guilty \u201cand the defendant himself replied in the affirmative.\u201d\nThe record completely supports Judge Brownson\u2019S conclusion that the plea of guilty entered in this case was not induced by any promise made by him that the death penalty would not be imposed. This assignment of error is overruled.\nThe eighth assignment is based upon the alleged error of Judge Brownson in receiving testimony that the defendant, previous to trial, had expressed an intention to plead guilty. This assignment is overruled.\nThe ninth assignment of error is based on the alleged error of the court below in approving the appointment of L. B. Schofield, Esq., as Assistant District Attorney. This assignment requires no discussion and is overruled.\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed and the record is remitted so that sentence may be carried out.\nIt is a fair inference from the records of the trials of this appellant and Polens that the motive for this homicide had its roots in the relationship between Polens and the wife of Seminuk. Mrs. Seminuk was convicted of murder in the second degree for complicity in the killing of her husband.\nIn a letter dated August 17, 1937, the Master of the Crown Office and Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal of England, informed the \u25a0writer that the question herein discussed is invariably asked in England of all prisoners before sentence in capital cases, but there is no statutory requirement that this question must be asked. That official expressed his opinion as follows: \u201cIf such an objection was raised it would be brushed aside by the Court of Criminal Appeal because manifestly any substantial point which could be put by a prisoner in the Court of the first instance, could also be put by him on appeal, but of course I speak under correction.\u201d"}
