{"id": "1279724", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Arnold,\nPlaintiff brought this action to recover damages for injury sustained by reason of a fall in the common laundry of an apartment house owned by Jennie Bodek, deceased defendant, and in which the plaintiff had been a tenant. She alleged that she slipped upon water on the floor of the laundry, and that the deceased had known of the accumulation of water.\nThe defendant, Jennie Bodek, died subsequently to plaintiff\u2019s injury; and under the prohibition of the Dead Man\u2019s Act (Act of May 23,1887, P. L\u201e 158, \u00a75(e), 28 PS \u00a7322) plaintiff was disqualified from testifying. However, she then offered to limit her claim to the maximum coverage of the liability insurance available to Jennie Bodek, \u2014 this to qualify her as a witness \u2014 \u2022 but the trial court sustained defendant\u2019s objection to the offer for the reason that the insurance did not remove the prohibition of the Act.\nThe Act makes no distinction between parties plaintiff and defendant, and it cannot be questioned that plaintiff was rendered incompetent to testify because of Jennie Bodek\u2019s death. The deceased party\u2019s estate cannot be subjected to testimony emanating from the mouth of the surviving party. Nor does it matter that the deceased party was insured against liability. Unless waived by the other party* tk\u00e9 pr'\u00f3hibiti\u00f3ii \u00f3f the Act is absolute, without regard to the existence or nonexistence of liability insurance. Cf. Parks v. Parks, 390 Pa. 287, 299, 300, 1352 A. 2d 65. The court below also declined to charge that because she was prohibited from testifying, a presumption of due care operated in plaintiff\u2019s favor.\nThere is a presumption of due care on the part of a decedent whose death or inability to testify occurs only by reason of accident: Schum v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 107 Pa. 8. But merely because the lips of the surviving party are sealed by virtue of the Dead Man\u2019s Act does not give to such survivor the benefit of any such presumption in his favor. The plaintiff was not able to testify and give her version of the situation.\nPlaintiff also contends that the court erred in permitting the jury to find that not only the defendant, but also the plaintiff, had constructive notice of the condition of the floor. The court so ruled on the basis .that plaintiff had been a regular user of the laundry over a period of years. This was so manifestly correct that it cannot be questioned.\nLastly, plaintiff complains that a witness was permitted to testify for the defendant-estate, where the interrogatories were propounded to the co-defendant (against whom plaintiff suffered a nonsuit), and the name of such witness had not been given. Again, the correctness of the court\u2019s action is clear; and in addition plaintiff, at trial, did not claim surprise but fully examined the witness.\nJudgment affirmed."}
