{"id": "924329", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nThe plaintiff asked the court to decline to submit the case to the jury but to reinstate the judgment with full force and effect, less amount realized at the sheriff\u2019s sale, to wit: $58.77. The court refused this point. The judgment was opened by the court on testimony deemed sufficient, and the trial resulted in a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $158.67. We cannot say that it was error to open the judgment and we therefore affirm it.\nJudgment affirmed."}
