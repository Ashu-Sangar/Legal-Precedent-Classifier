{"id": "8845388", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is the question to be decided: Is an individual who voluntarily resigns from his employment in order to go into business for himself as an independent contractor entitled to unemployment benefits upon the unsuccessful and involuntary termination of his private business venture? The Unemployment Compensation Board of Review and the Superior Court of Pennsylvania answered this question affirmatively.\nPerkins Dawkins, claimant, was employed by the Sun Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company, Chester, Pa., as a third-class sheet metal worker from October 20, 1942 until August 4, 1945, when he left appellant company\u2019s employ in order to engage in business for himself as a roofer. Claimant noted the following reason on his official separation slip: \u201cQuit, going into business for myself.\u201d Prom the date of his separation, claimant conducted a business as a roofing contractor, making about $35 per week, and he continued his private business until November 1945, when he was forced to give it up because he could no longer secure necessary materials for carrying on his work.\nThe record establishes that on August 30,1945, Daw-kins filed a claim for unemployment benefits with his local unemployment compensation office. On that date claimant\u2019s \u201cbenefit year\u201d began, his \u201cbase year\u201d being the calendar year of 1944. The Bureau of Unemployment Compensation rendered a decision on December 7,1945, declaring that claimant met all the requirements of the Unemployment Compensation Law and was therefore eligible to receive benefits. The Sun Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., Dawkins\u2019 base year employer, appealed from this decision and the case was referred to a Bureau Referee, who on February 27,1946, conducted a hearing. In testifying at that time, Dawkins told how he had reached a decision to resign from his employment with appellant company, as follows:\n\u201c. . . the war was over and I hadn\u2019t been making any headway, I did some side work and I figured I could do better on the outside doing roofing. I came out to do work for myself, but I put in my resignation I didn\u2019t walk off the job. I gave them a whole month\u2019s resignation. . . . After the war was over I considered two things, first, my age and I figured I would probably be one of the first ones to go because I was 57 so I took that into consideration and between time I built up myself a nice little business.\u201d \u25a0 '\nThe Referee concurred in the decision of the Bureau and affirmed its Findings of Fact, which consisted, inter alia; of the following: \u201c2. A month previous to August 4th, 1945, claimant gave his employer notie\u00e9 that he was going to resign for the specific purpose of going into business for himself.\u201d\nIn his \u201cReasoning\u201d, the Referee made the following statements: \u201cThe Referee believes that this business of claimant\u2019s was a legitimate business and its failure' to succeed was no fault of the claimant\u2019s and his separation therefrom can be construed as unemployed due to lack of work. The Referee must therefore conclude that claimant did not voluntarily leave his last place of employment without good cause within the meaning of the Law.\u201d\nThe appellant thereupon filed an appeal with the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review and on August 5, 1946, the Board of Review issued an order upholding the referee\u2019s Findings, of Facts and Conclusion of Law awarding benefits to the claimant. The Board of Review stated: \u201cOn the basis of these Findings [which are \u201csupported by the evidence\u201d], the Referee properly concluded that the claimant .cannot be disqualified under the provisions of Section 402(b) , of the Law. The unemployment for which claimant seeks benefits was due to the failure of a business enterprise and not to voluntarily leaving work, and for this reason he must be found eligible for benefits with respect to tlie provisions of the Unemployment Compensation Law.\u201d\nA petition seeking \u201cjudicial review on the ground that the board erred in concluding as a matter of law that the claimant\u2019s act of voluntarily leaving his employment for the purpose of going into business for himself, constitutes \u2018good cause\u2019 within the meaning of the Unemployment Compensation Act\u201d was filed by appellant with the Superior Court of Pennsylvania. A review was granted. The Superior Court sustained the decision of the Board of Review, saying, inter alia: \u201cUnder the definition, claimant clearly was not unemployed until his business failed. In the interim, between the date when he left his employment and the failure of his business, he was employed since he received remuneration for services rendered in his business.\u201d\nAppellant contends that claimant was an \u201cindependent contractor\u201d after he severed his connections with appellant company and not an \u201cemploye\u201d within the contemplation of the Unemployment Compensation Act and thus was disqualified from receiving the benefits conferred by the act; that if claimant\u2019s \u201cemploye\u201d status was not forfeited by virtue of his resignation, he was nevertheless ineligible for benefits under section 802 of the Act, 43 PS Supp., which reads: \u201cAn employe shall be ineligible for compensation for any week \u2014 (a) ... (b) In which his unemployment is due to voluntarily leaving work without good cause . . .\u201d As amended April 23, 1942, Ex. Sess., P. L. 60, sec. 4; May 21, 1943, P. L. 337, sec. 1; May 29, 1945, P. L. 1145, sec. 9. Effective June 1, 1945.\nApparently this case is sui generis. We find no case like it in either this or other jurisdictions. Our decision must be based on reasoning and not on authority.\nThe decision under review is based on the postulate that the \u201cunemployment for which claimant seeks benefits was due to the failure of a business enterprise and not to voluntarily leaving work, and for this reason he must be found eligible for ben\u00e9fits with respect to the provisions of the Unemployment Compensation Law\u201d. This rationale Ave do not accept. The initial question is: Was Dawkins an \u201cemploye\u201d within the purview of the Unemployment Compensation Law? The Pennsylvania Unemployment Compensation Act defines \u201cemploye\u201d as follows: \u201c \u2018Employe\u2019 means every individual, whether male, female, citizen, alien or minor, who is performing or subsequent to January first, one thousand nine hundred thirty-six, has performed services for an employer in an employment subject to this act.\u201d 43 PS Supp. 753 (i). ;\nDawkins while in the service of Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company was an \u201cemploye\u201d. But subsequently he changed his status from that of an employe to that of an \u201cindividual engaged in an independently established business\u201d.\nAt this point it is pertinent to quote certain sections of the Unemployment Compensation Act. Section 753 (1) (I) states: \u201c\u2018Employment\u2019 means (i) all service performed prior to the first day of January, one thousand nine hundred forty-five, which was employment as defined in this section prior to the effective date of this amendment, and (ii) all service performed after the thirty-first day of December, one thousand nine hundred forty-four, which is employment as defined in this section as hereby amended ... (2) The term \u2018Employment\u2019 shall include an individual\u2019s entire service performed within or both within and without this Commonwealth, if \u2014 (A) ... (B) ... \u2018An individual performing services for remuneration in an employment subject to this act shall be deemed to be performing such services for wages, unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the department that \u2014 (a) such individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of such services both under his contract of service and in fact; and (b) . . . (c) that such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business\u201d: 43 PS Supp. (i), As amended, April 23, 1942, Ex. Sess., P. L. 60, sec. 1; May 21, 1943, P. L. 271, No. 125, sec. 1; May. 27, 1943, P. L. 717, see. 1; May 29, 1945, P. L. 1145, sec. 1. Effective January 1,1945.\nSubsections (u) and (x) of section 753, as amended, May 29, 1945, state: \u201c(u) \u2018Unemployment\u2019 \u2014 An individual shall be deemed unemployed with respect to any week during which he performs no services and with respect to which no remuneration is paid or payable to him . . .\u201d Effective June 1,. 1945.\n\u201c(x) \u2018Wages\u2019 means all remuneration for employment . . . paid with respect to all services performed prior to January first, one thousand nine hundred and forty-two . . .\u201d Effective June 1,1945.\nIt is provided in the Act, 43 P.S. 802, as amended, 1942, on April 23, P. L. 60, sec. 4; 1943, May 21, P. L. 337, sec. 1; 1945, May 29, P. L. 1145, sec. 9, as follows: \u201cAn employe shall be ineligible for compensation for any week \u2014 (a.) . . .; (b) In which his unemployment is due to voluntarily leaving work without good cause: . .\nIn discussing the phrase \u201cgood cause\u201d the Superior Court says, . . it must be a good cause which animates a man to seek the fullest expression and amplest development of his highest skills and capacities, and to strive for steady employment, be it in his own business or in service for others.\u201d It may be conceded that this statement is an expression of sound social philosophy, but the \u201cgood canse\u201d thus referred to is not the \u201cgood cause\u201d which under the Act justifies an employe voluntarily leaving his work. If an employe left his work to fight for his country on the field of battle his act would be praiseworthy but his patriotic motive and his willingness to sacrifice his life would not constitute the good cause which as a motive for leaving his \u25a0 work would maintain his eligibility for compensation benefits after-wards. By \u201cgood cause\u201d as used in the Act is obviously meant such a cause as justifies an employe\u2019s voluntarily leaving the ranks of the employed and joining the ranks of the unemployed. For example, if an employe was compelled to work in a position where his life was constantly menaced by a heavy object over his head which .was suspended from the ceiling by a palpably inadequate or defective chain, he could successfully plead \u201cgood cause\u201d for voluntarily leaving his employment. The same would.be true if he was- compelled to work under inexcusable conditions which were palpably, detrimental to his health, such as working in a mine or a factory where the supply of fresh air was obviously insufficient to sustain life.\nIn Dames Unemployment Compensation Case, 158 Pa. Superior Ct. 564, the Superior Court held that a woman who left her employment to marry could not have that praiseworthy motive, accepted- as a good-cause for leaving her employment.. In that case Judge Reno said, \u201cno legal obligation rested, upon the: claimant to marry or to join her fiance\u201d (who was in the Armed Forces). This case is an example of the fact that a laudable motive for leaving employment and a \u201cgood cause\u201d within the meaning of the Act are entirely different things.\nIn Teicher Unemployment Compensation Case, 154 Pa. Superior Ct. 250, the. claimant left her employment to live with her husband who .was in the Armed Forces. All seven judges of the Superior Court held that that claimant by voluntarily leaving her work and moving to Alexandria to be with her husband made herself \u201cunavailable for work\u201d and was therefore not entitled to compensation. Five members of the Court declared that the claimant in leaving her job in order to be with her husband left her work \u201cwith good cause\u201d. \u25a0 This latter conclusion was not necessary to a decision of the case. We express no agreement with the dictum that such a \u201chumanly justifiable cause\u201d as \u201cthe impulse which induces a devoted wife to spend with a husband, who is a member of the Armed Forces in time of war, what may prove to be the last days they shall ever be together on earth\u201d (as the Superior Court expressed it) constitutes a \u201cgood cause\u201d for leaving a job, within the meaning of the Act.\nIn Sturdevant Unemployment Compensation Case, 158 Pa. Superior Ct. 548, it appeared that a married woman, employed as a skilled machine operator in an industrial plant, left her work to join her husband in the armed forces near a city other than that in which she was employed; that she registered for work in the nearby city, stating that she was available for a 30-day period only; and that in the new locality there were no demands for her particular skill; it was held, apparently on the authority of the dictum in the Teicher case, supra, that claimant was entitled to unemployment compensation benefits. In this Sturdevant case Judge Reno said:\n\u201cOf course, \u2018good cause\u2019 and \u2018personal reasons\u2019 are .flexible phrases, capable of contraction and expansion, and by construction, all meaning can be compressed out of them or they may be expanded to cover almost any meaning. . . . However, in whatever context they appear, they connote, as minimum requirements, real circumstances, substantial reasons, objective conditions, palpable forces that operate to produce correlative results, adequate excuses that will- bear the test of reason, just grounds for action, and always the element of good faith. . . ., When we approach the problem of a married woman who leaves her work to join her husband we realize immediately that we are in .the presence of a compulsion which readily supplies a personal reason and a good cause. Under our law, it is the legal right of the husband to select the marital domicile and it is the legal duty of the wife to reside with him. Hence, when a husband moves the marital domicile to a distant point where he secures work and his wife voluntarily leaves her work to accompany him, her compliance with the duty which the law casts upon her satisfies the requirements of \u2018good cause\u2019.\u201d\nTo hold that a married woman who quits her job to join her husband in a new domicile is voluntarily becoming \u201cunemployed\u201d for a \u201cgood cause\u201d within the meaning of the Act is to open the door to so much fraud on employers that one may doubt that such a construction of the Unemployment Compensation Act conforms to the canon that \u201call laws should receive a sensible construction\u201d: per Field, J., in United States v. Kirby, 7 Wall 482, 486, cited with approval in Watson v. Witkin, 343 Pa. 1, 6. In this last cited case we quoted with approval what Judge Cardozo said in In re the Matter of Jacob Rouss, an Attorney, 221 N. Y. 81, 116 N. E. 782, as follows: \u201cStatutes must be so construed, if possible, that absurdity and mischief may be avoided.\u201d If a woman can quit her job in order to follow her husband into another domicile where work for her will not be available, and then become entitled to the benefits of this Compensation Act, and if a workman can quit his job to go into private business and then when that business fails he can still reap the benefits of this Compensation Act, the latter will in many instances be used as a \u201cshort cut\u201d to a temporary pension. While the good faith of the claimants in such cases is always open to attack, whoever makes such an attack has the burden of proving bad faith and in this class of cases it will be a difficult burden to maintain.\nNo principle applicable to the interpretation of statutes has been more widely used than the principle enumerated in Heydon\u2019s Case, 3 Coke 7a, 14 Eng. Rul. Cas. 816, cited in 25 R. C. L. 1016, section 254, as follows: . . for the sure and true-interpretation of all statutes in general four things are to be discerned and considered :\u2018 (1) What was the common law before the making of the act? (2) What was the mischief and defect for which the common law did not provide? (3) What remedy the Parliament hath resolved and appointed to cure the disease of the commonwealth. And (4) the true reason of the remedy.\u2019 \u201d\nThese second and fourth -\u2018things\u201d should be considered in solving the question before us. The \u201cmischief\u201d to be remedied, was the condition of involuntarily out of work laboring men in. an era when wages were such that it was difficult for them to save money for the proverbial \u201crainy day\u201d. Such unemployed workmen frequently became indigent and their families were left without the necessities of life. The \u201ctrue reason of the remedy\u201d provided in the Unemployment Compensation Act is clearly set forth in the intendments of the Act, inter alia, in section 3 (43 PS 752), as follows:\n\u201ca. That the economic insecurity which the act seeks to avoid is the \u2018Involuntary unemployment and its resulting burden of indigency\u2019 which falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker ...\u201d\n\u201cb. That this insecurity can best be met \u2018by the systematic setting aside of financial reserves to be used as compensation for the loss of wages by employes . . .\u2019\n\u201cc. That the Commonwealth is justified in exercising its police powers \u2018for the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves . . .\u2019 This reserve is of course to be set aside by the employer and is \u2018to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own\u2019.\u201d\nThese intendments make it clear that those within the protection of the Act are \u201cunemployed workers\u201d. By that last quoted phrase is meant those who while work ing for wages become unemployed. In that class there is not included those who did work for wages but who voluntarily removed themselves from the latter class to become independently engaged in a business of their own.\nWhen this cl\u00e1imant voluntarily quit his job as an employe for wages to become an independent contractor he took himself out of the class entitled to the protection of the Act now under consideration. He became a businessman at his own risk. He could not assume his new status with the legal assurance that if his expectations of more favorable economic results from his new status was realized he would be the sole gainer while if his venture failed he could fall bach on the compensation benefits which were his when he was a worker for wages. The law does not make Pennsylvania employers the insurers to any extent whatsoever of the private ventures of their employes. In a free society any employe may quit his work for any reason which appears to him adequate, but if he \u201cgambles\u201d with his job as an employe in the hope of becoming a businessman and an employer himself he cannot expect to find that the \u201cgame\u201d is one in which all the possible gains are to be his while the losses, if any, are to be borne chiefly by his last employer.\nIn his testimony claimant gives his reason for ceasing to be an employe and going into business for himself. He said: . from the time I put in there and the way I put the time in I figured I wasn\u2019t getting the proper break I should have gotten.\u201d He added what is quoted in the third paragraph of the opinion. Without consulting his employer and without seeking any information as to his probable employment tenure he decided that he would leave the ranks of wage earners and become a business man, and so on August 4,1945 he became \u201ccustomarily engaged in an independent business\u201d, that of roofing. He continued \u201con his own\u201d from August until November, when he discovered that by his change of status be bad worsened his economic position. If, for example, be bad been admitted to the Bar just before the war and bad at once, for either patriotic or economic reasons, become an employe of the Sun Shipbuilding Company and bad on August 4, 1945 quit bis job and entered upon the practice of law and then about three months later bad decided that the law was not bis field, be could not by abandoning his professional career have restored bis eligibility to the Unemployment Compensation benefits he had voluntarily forfeited months before by renouncing his then status.\nIt is true that claimant was unemployed after he failed as a businessman, but since he had renounced his status as a \u201cwage earner\u201d in order to become a \u201cbusinessman\u201d his failure in the latter role did not automatically restore him to the status of an \u201cunemployed employe\u201d any more than a manumitted slave\u2019s failure to gain a livelihood on his own piece of land would automatically restore him to the status he had before his manumission. Claimant can be restored to his former status of an employe only by again performing as an employe \u201cservices for an employer in any employment subject to this Act\u201d. The \u201cgood cause\u201d which compelled claimant to terminate his career as an individual contractor cannot be used as a substitute for the not-good cause which impelled him to leave the employ of the Shipbuilding Company.\nAn individual wage-earner is within the protection of the Unemployment Compensation Act only as long as be has the status of an employe as that term is used in the Aet. His idleness immediately following his employment does not affect his status. He is still an employe, though out of work, if (1) his being out of work was not willed by himself, or (2) if his being out of work was voluntary but was based on a \u201cgood cause\u201d within the meaning of the Act. The \u201cgood cause\u201d which justifies an employe\u2019s terminating his relations with his employer must, other than in those exceptional cases where reasons \u201cpersonal to the employe\u201d may nnder a certain state of facts be adjudged \u201cgood\u201d, be one connected with Ms employment. He certainly is not within the \u201cgood cause\u201d provision if he quits his employment in order to comply with the wishes of his wife, or in order to marry a girl who made his quitting his employment a condition precedent to the marriage, or because of some whimsical desire or fancy or ambition of his own. See Barclay White Co. v. Unemp. Comp. Bd., 356 Pa. 43, 48, 50 A. 2d 336, where we emphasized the fact that Article I, section 3, of the Unemployment Compensation Law of December 5, 1936, P. L. (1937) 2897, as amended, was enacted \u201cfor the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.\u201d In that case we also said (p. 48) : \u201cIt is impossible to give a general definition of \u2018good .cause\u2019. The meaning of those words must be determined in each case from the facts of that case.\u201d We added: \u201c\u2018good cause\u2019 must be so interpreted that the fundamental purpose of the legislation shall not be destroyed.\u201d Even in matters connected with his employment there must be some limit to the legally approved list of \u201cgood causes\u201d for quitting employment. The quitting must be for such a cause as would reasonably motivate in a similar situation the average able-bodied and qualified worker to give up his or her employment with its certain wage rewards in order to enter the ranks of the \u201ccompensated unemployed\u201d.\nAn employe may contend that the character and habits of his fellow employes are distasteful to him, he may contend that the work he is engaged in (such as the making of war munitions or alcoholic beverages) offends his religious or moral principles, or he may contend that his family objects to his working in a job in which he becomes begrimed with dirt, yet these and similar reasons cannot be legally accepted as a \u201cgood cause\u201d for leaving one\u2019s employment. If an employe leaves his position as a wage earner so that he may become a professional man or a business man or any other sort of \u201cfree-lance\u201d lie cannot successfully contend that be left Ms former employment for a statutorily \u201cgood cause\u201d and that if be fails at bis independent work be is immediately restored to bis status quo ante.\nWe do not agree that since this claimant\u2019s ambition to be independently self-supporting was a \u201claudable\u201d one, such ambition must be adjudged a \u201cgood cause\u201d for leaving bis then employment. In most civil cases requiring the adjudication of rights and liabilities the laudability of an actor\u2019s motive has no bearing on the legal appraisal of bis act. If every reason which appeals to an employe\u2019s bead or his heart is to be accepted as a \u201cgood cause\u201d for his or her voluntarily leaving a job in a locality where there is no other work available, the Unemployment Compensation Law will become in many instances an invitation to a compensated rest.\nThis claimant on August 4, 1945, voluntarily took himself out of that class which is under the protection of this law for a cause which cannot legally be recognized as \u201cgood\u201d. He took an economic risk when he left the employer-employe field with the expectation of succeeding as an independent contractor and then becoming an employer. When his private venture failed he did not ipso facto become an unemployed employe\u2014 he became an unemployed businessman.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court is reversed and the order of the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review affirming the decision and order of the bureau and the referee granting the claimant unemployment compensation benefits, is set aside.\nThat remuneration means wages is clear from a consideration of the applicable section of the Act before its amendment. There it was stated \u201c. . . An individual performing services for remuneration in an employment subject to this act shall be deemed to be performing such services for' wages, unless and until it is shown to the satisfaction of the department that \u2014 (a) ... (b) ... (c) that such individual is customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business.\u201d 43 PS 753 (j), Dec. 5, 1936, Second Ex. Sess., P. L.
