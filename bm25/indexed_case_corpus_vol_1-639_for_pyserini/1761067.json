It was alleged that appellee misplaced a written agreement which would have conferred immunity upon appellant against criminal prosecution by federal authorities. The tort action was dismissed by the lower court en banc in response to appellee\u2019s preliminary objections. The Superior Court affirmed per curiam. Ferri v. Rossetti, 253 Pa.Super. 614, 384 A.2d 995 (1978). This Court agreed and affirmed. Ferri v. Rossetti, 483 Pa. 327, 396 A.2d 1193 (1979).\nSubsequently, appellant\u2019s petition to the United States Supreme Court for issuance of writ of certiorari was granted.
