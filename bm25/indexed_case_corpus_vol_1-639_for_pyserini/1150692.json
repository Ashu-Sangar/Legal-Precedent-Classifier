{"id": "1150692", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nJune 30, 1933:\nDefendant appeals from the refusal of judgment n. o. v. and a new trial in two actions, both resulting from the s\u00e1me automobile collision and tried as one in the court below.\nThere is nothing in the record.to justify a reversal, particularly since, on a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto, the evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to plaintiff. Assignments of error raise only questions involving facts which were properly submitted to the jury, and we find ample testimony warranting the verdicts. The evidence does not, as argued by defendant, show incontrovertible physical facts proving the accident could not have occurred as claimed by plaintiff.\nThe judgments are affirmed."}
