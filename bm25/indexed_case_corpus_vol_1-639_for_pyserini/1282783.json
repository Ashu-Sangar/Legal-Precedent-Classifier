{"id": "1282783", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nSamuel Metzgar died February 19, 1955 survived by a sister, Savannah B. Paul, and nephews and nieces, children of deceased brothers and sisters. Under his last will \u2014 executed March 10, 1914 \u2014 he provided, inter alia: \u201cI devise that all my property: Beal, and personal to my beloved wife, Ida Priscilla, during her life. And from and after her death to my Brothers and Sisters then living share and share alike\u201d. .\nThe wife-life tenant died on December 16, 1936, 22 years after execution of the will and 19 years prior , to the testator\u2019s death. When she died two sisters of the testator were then living, Mary E. Foreman and Savannah B. Paul. The former died in 1937, her- sole survivor being a daughter, Mary I. Etienne. When testator died, he, (so far as herein pertinent), was survived by the one living sister, Savannah B. Paul, and the niece, Mary I. Etienne.\nWhen testator\u2019s personal representatives filed their account they suggested distribution of the balance of the estate to Savannah Paul on the theory that she alone had survived the testator, and thus constituted the only member of the class entitled to take. Mary Etienne claimed that, since her mother, Mary E. Lore-man, survived the life tenant, she, as the representative of her mother, was a member of the class, and was entitled to take one-half of the estate. She, accordingly, filed exceptions to the suggested distribution.\nThe court below referred the matter to an auditor who found that testator had intended to make a class gift, that membership in the class was fixed at the time of the wife-life tenant\u2019s death, that the members of the class were Mary E. Loreman and Savannah Paul and recommended distribution of the balance of the estate equally between Savannah Paul and Mary E. Foreman\u2019s only survivor, Mary Etienne. The court below adopted the auditor\u2019s recommendations and entered a decree dividing the estate equally between Savannah Paul and Mary Etienne. From this decree Savannah Paul took this appeal.\nThe sole question herein presented is whether under the language of this will membership in the class of takers was to be ascertained at the time of the life-tenant\u2019s, or the testator\u2019s, death. Any discussion of whether the interest of the testator\u2019s brothers and sisters under this will was vested or contingent would seem academic in view of the testamentary requirement that the takers must survive to a certain time or event; whether the interest be vested or contingent, if the taker failed to survive, his or her interest would be destroyed. See, e. g., Buzby\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa. 111.\nAn examination of this will reveals clearly the testator\u2019s intent in several respects: (1) testator\u2019s wife was the primary object of his bounty and until her death occurred no one was to share in testator\u2019s property; (2) the factual situation which testator contemplated when he made his will was entirely different from that which actually occurred, i.e., his wife did not survive him; (3) not all, but only some, of his brothers and sisters were to share in his estate, i.e., only those brothers and sisters who survived a certain event. It is our problem, if possible, to fix that event.\nIn the absence of a contrary intention apparent from the language and terms of the will, the rule in this Commonwealth has been that survivorship is to be determined as of the date of the testator\u2019s death; Johnson v. Morton, 10 Pa. 245; Ross v. Drake, 37 Pa. 373; Woelpper\u2019s Appeal, 126 Pa. 562, 17 A. 870; Black v. Woods, 213 Pa. 583, 63 A. 129; Kohl v. Kepler, 266 Pa. 522, 110 A. 239; Morris\u2019s Estate, 270 Pa. 120, 113 A. 61; Nass\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 380, 182 A. 401.\nHowever, this rule is one of construction and therefore must yield to the actual intent of a testator if the expression of such intent can be garnered from the language of the will. As Mr. Justice Mitchell well stated in Woelpper\u2019s Appeal, supra, (p. 572) : \u201cWith the desire to reduce to a minimum the perplexity and uncertainty inseparable from the subject, courts have established certain more or less artificial and arbitrary canons of construction, by which certain forms of expression are presumed to have certain meanings, and in doubtful cases these presumptions are held to be decisive. But all of these canons are subservient to the great rule as to intent, and are made to aid, not to override it. As in all such cases, care is required that tools shall not become fetters, and that the real end shall not be sacrificed to what was intended only as the means of reaching it.\u201d\nSection 14(4) of the Wills Act of 1947 provides: . . In the absence of a contrary intent appearing therein, wills shall be construed as to real and personal estate in accordance with the following rules: . . .\n' \u201c(4) Meaning of \u2018Heirs\u2019' and \u2018Next of Kin,\u2019 etc.; Time of Ascertaining Class. A devise or bequest of real or personal estate, whether directly or in trust, to the testator\u2019s or another designated person\u2019s \u2018heirs\u2019 or \u2018next of kin\u2019 or \u2018relatives\u2019 or \u2018family\u2019 or to \u2018the persons thereunto entitled under the intestate laws\u2019 or to persons described by words of similar import, shall mean those persons, including the spouse, who would take under the intestate laws if the testator or other designated person were to die intestate at the time when such class is to be ascertained, a resident of the Commonwealth, and owning the estate so devised or bequeathed: Provided, however, That the share of a spouse, other than the spouse of the testator, shall not include the ten thousand dollar allowance under the intestate laws. The time when sueh class is to he ascertained shall he the time when the devise or bequest is to take effect in enjoyment.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). This statutory provision applies only to class gifts and then only to such class gifts as fall fairly within the statutory language. The instant gift is a class gift and \u201cbrothers and sisters\u201d are sufficiently \u201cwords of similar import\u201d to bring the instant gift within the statutory' provision. Here again, however, the statutory rule must yield if within the four corners of this Avill a contrary intent appears.\nUnder the testamentary scheme of this will testator\u2019s brothers and sisters are to take only \u201cfrom and after [the life tenant\u2019s] death\u201d: . The will then goes on to provide that only such brothers and sisters shall take who shall be \u201cthen living\u201d. The word \u201cthen\u201d becomes all important; sometimes employed as an adverb of time, at other times it is employed as a reference to an event. Our courts have interpreted \u201cthen\u201d in various ways depending upon its use and position in the will and the purpose for which its interpretation is sought: in Buzby\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa. 111, the word \u201cthen\u201d was held to refer to the testator\u2019s, not the life tenant\u2019s, death; in Wood v. Schoen, 216 Pa. 425, 66 A. 79, the word \u201cthen\u201d was construed as referring to the death of the life tenant; in Nass\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 380, 182 A. 401, the word \u201cthen\u201d was held insufficient to bar the application of the general rule of construction; in Fitzpatrick\u2019s Estate, 233 Pa. 33, 81 A. 815, the word \u201cthen\u201d was held to. refer to \u201cheirs\u201d of a testator living at his, not the life tenant\u2019s, death; in Dailey\u2019s Estate, 268 Pa. 379, 111 A. 922, the word \u201cthen\u201d was held to refer to the death of the life tenant; in Heath\u2019s Estate, 286 Pa. 335, 133 A. 558, the phrase \u201cthen living\u201d was held to refer to the date of the life tenant\u2019s death; in Laughlin\u2019s Estate, 336 Pa. 529, 9 A. 2d 383, the word \u201cthen\u201d was held to refer to the life tenant\u2019s, not the testator\u2019s, death; in Bomberger Estate, 347 Pa. 465, 32 A. 2d 729, the phrase \u201cthen living\u201d was held to refer.to the date of the life tenant\u2019s death. An examination of these cases well illustrates that which was said in Long\u2019s Estate, 270 Pa. 480, 487, 113 A. 675: \u201c. \u2018. . . precedents are of little value in the construction of wiils, because, when used under different circumstances and with different context, the same words may express different intentions. When the intent of the testator, and by that is meant his actual intent, can be fairly gathered from his words, the fact that, another testator has used the same words with a different meaning is of no avail. Neither precedents nor rules of construction can override the testator\u2019s expressed intent . . .\u2019 \u201d\nThe language of this will leads us to the conclusion that when the testator used the phrase \u201cthen living\u201d in juxtaposition with the clause \u201cfrom and after the [life tenant\u2019s] death\u201d he fixed the event upon which membership in the class of takers would be ascertained as the death of the wife-life tenant rather than his own death. While the takers would not enter into enjoyment of his estate until his death the class closed as of the death of his wife. Any other construction of the language of this will would amount to distortion of that which testator stated in his will.\nThe language of this will sufficiently expresses an intent contrary to the general rule of construction and to the statutory provision in the Wills Act of 1947, supra, so that neither control in our construction of this will.\nWhen the will was made the testator contemplated that his wife would outlive him. It may be urged that testator must have intended the language of the will to apply only in the event that his wife survived him and that he directed distribution of his estate to such brothers and sisters as might be living at the time of her death only if she survived him. While that may have been the testator\u2019s intent yet for us to add such a contingency would amount to an alteration or variation of the will as made. The fact that for a period of approximately 19 years, well aware that the factual situation contemplated in the will could not occur, testator did not change his will does not alter the situation. We are bound to construe this will according to its language. In expounding a will the question is not what the testator meant but rather what is the meaning of the words which he employed. That is not to say that a testator\u2019s meaning when apparent should be disregarded. It does mean that we cannot reach the testator\u2019s intent by what he might have meant or even what under the changed circumstances he would have meant but only by what he said. In Woelpper\u2019s Appeal, supra, p. 572, the scope of our inquiry has been well defined: \u201cThe search is confined to [the testator\u2019s] language, but its object is still his meaning.\u201d\nWe cannot assume that the testator meant that the terms of the will would apply only in the event his wife survived him. Such a construction would amount to re-writing the testator\u2019s will. Under a proper construction of testator\u2019s last will, membership in the class to take his property was fixed as of the date of the wife-life tenant\u2019s death. At that time there were living but two sisters of the testator and each became entitled to share equally in testator\u2019s property at the time of his death.\nThe court below properly construed this will and properly directed distribution of the balance of the estate to the surviving sister, Savannah B. Paul, and the only child of the deceased sister, Mary E. Lore-man.\nDecree affirmed.\nCosts on appellant.\nYet for 19 years from the time the factual situation changed testator allowed his will to remain unchanged.\nAct of April 24, 1947, P.L. 89, \u00a714(4), 20 PS \u00a7180.14."}
