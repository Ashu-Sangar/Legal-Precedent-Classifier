{"id": "1132405", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal is from a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County dismissing exceptions to and confirming adjudication of the first and final account of the Integrity Trust Co., substituted trustee under the will of James Irwin, deceased.\nJames Irwin died September 30, 1888, leaving a will which provides, among other items: \u201cI give and bequeath to my son James A. Irwin and friend John Roberts, of Philadelphia, the sum of Forty thousand Dollars upon Trust to invest the same......and to pay the income thereof as the same shall become due and payable to my wife Ellen D. Irwin during the term of her natural life......, and upon her death to collect in the investments and to pay the same, share and share alike, to my children absolutely who shall be living at the time of my decease, and to the legal issue of any deceased child or children who shall as aforesaid survive said date by way of representation of such child or children ......\u201d\nEllen D. Irwin, testator\u2019s widow and life beneficiary of the trust, died on June 16,1930; the present account of the fund was filed September 4, 1930.\nAt the time of his death testator was survived by eight children and by two grandchildren (James McNair Irwin and Robert S. Irwin, appellees), whose father, Nathaniel D. Irwin, predeceased testator. On the death of the life tenant only two of testator\u2019s children were living; the six children who survived testator but died during the life tenancy left issue surviving them. The court below awarded the trust estate, which showed a balance of principal of $37,048.04, in nine parts to testator\u2019s children living and to the representatives of deceased children.\nAppellant, the son of one of testator\u2019s children who died during the life tenancy, contends the award should have been \u201cto the children of testator who survived him and the issue of such children, the latter taking by way of representation of such parent,\u201d thus excluding the two children of Nathaniel D. Irwin who died in testator\u2019s lifetime. Appellant contends the grammatical form of the bequest necessitates such construction and the fact of testator\u2019s having provided a separate trust of $4,000 each, in another item of his will, for these two grandchildren, confirms this interpretation.\nWhether or not grammatical rules would require such construction to be put on the words of testator, as appellant contends and appellees deny, it cannot be adopted as the intention of testator. As the court below states, \u201cThe use of incorrect or inaccurate language cannot defeat a testator\u2019s plain intent.\u201d Here, \u201cA surviving child by the immediately preceding clause has already been given a vested share. As such child would be living at the time of the testator\u2019s death, and therefore entitled to take, the clause respecting his issue would then, of course, be of no effect [if interpreted according to appellant\u2019s contention]. We can attribute no intention to a testator of writing meaningless words in his will when another construction gives such words intelligent and proper meaning.\u201d The fact of the separate bequest to the two grandchildren whose father had already died is not evidence of an intention to exclude them from participating in the distribution of this trust; particularly as he makes a special bequest to another grandson also, whose mother, testator\u2019s daughter, survived testator.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed at cost of appellant."}
