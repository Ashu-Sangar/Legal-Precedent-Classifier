{"id": "8846031", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nPlaintiff appeals from an order of the court below sustaining preliminary objections to his amended complaint in assumpsit in which he claimed $5,000. for damages resulting from defendant\u2019s failure to retrans-fer a liquor license.\nPlaintiff leased his premises 253 E. Chestnut Street, Lancaster, Pa. to the defendant as a licensed premises and in and by said lease transferred to defendant a liquor license then held by plaintiff. The lease contained the following provision: \u201cShould Howard P. Snavely remove from the within leased premises while he had a liquor license \u2014 he agrees to transfer said liquor license to Frank Piehler\u201d. Snavely removed from said leased premises while he had a liquor license and leased the next door property and had the license transferred to himself at said place. Defendant then refused to retransfer the liquor license to plaintiff. Plaintiff claimed that the failure to transfer said liquor license damaged him to the extent of $5,000., viz, the difference between the value of his property with a liquor license and the value of his property without a liquor license.\nThe law is well settled that a liquor license is not a property right, but only a purely personal privilege for a specific limited time, which is subject to termination by the Liquor Control Board for cause and which, in any event, terminates with the licensee\u2019s life. A liquor license or the privilege to sell liquors for a specified time, although often very valuable, is not assignable, (as that term is generally understood) nor does it go to the personal representatives or become an asset of the holder\u2019s estate in case of death: Grimm\u2019s Estate, 181 Pa. 233, 236, 37 A. 403; Blumenthal\u2019s Petition, 125 Pa. 412, 415, 18 A. 395; Buck\u2019s Est., 185 Pa. 57, 60, 39 A. 821; Mueller\u2019s Est., 190 Pa. 601, 603, 42 A. 1021; Commonwealth v. Cochran Post No. 251, 350 Pa. 111, 119, 38 A. 2d 250; Spankard\u2019s Liquor License Case, 138 Pa. Superior Ct. 251, 259, 10 A. 2d 899.\nEquity will grant specific performance of a contract to sell or assign a liquor license \u2014 Cochrane v. Szpakowski, 355 Pa. 357, 49 A. 2d 692; Pavlick v. Zellermeyer, 359 Pa. 278, 59 A. 2d 92; Rekas v. Dopkavich, 362 Pa. 292, 66 A. 2d 230; Ritz v. Rafail, 366 Pa. 274, 77 A. 2d 411 \u2014 for the reasons hereinafter set forth. We believe the reasons why equity will act demonstrate why an action of assumpsit will not lie herein; and that the following language in the Court\u2019s opinion in Cochrane v. Szpakowski, 355 Pa. 357, 362, 49 A. 2d 692, applies equally to the instant case \u2014 \u201c \u2018this contract involves the transfer and ownership of a retail liquor license, the value of which cannot be accurately determined in an action at law. It seems unrealistic ... to close our eyes to the fact that under the Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 806, the Quota Act, new retail liquor licenses cannot be issued by the Board in the City of [Philadelphia] because the number allowed by that Act is greatly exceeded by the existing licenses. This gives to the license here involved a peculiar value depending upon the business ability and the popularity of the owner, which cannot be accurately or adequately measured or compensated for in an action at law.\u2019 \u201d\nIt is unnecessary to decide whether an action in deceit would lie and if so, what the measure of damages would be; suffice it to say that plaintiff\u2019s present action in assumpsit will not lie and that the preliminary objections to plaintiff\u2019s complaint were properly sustained by the court below.\nOrder affirmed.\nWe are not unmindful that a liquor license may be transferred in accordance with and subject to the terms and provisions of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Act of November 29, 1983, P. L. 15, as amended, 47 P.S. \u00a7744-1, et seq.; and that it has been the practice of the present Liquor Control Board to transfer the liquor license of a deceased licensee to his personal representatives or wife, upon compliance with the Board\u2019s regulations."}
