{"id": "1775357", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Justice.\nAppellant was employed as an operating room technician by appellee, Presbyterian University Hospital. On May 27, 1975 during her working hours, Ms. Tatrai became ill and was directed by her supervisor to go to the emergency room of the hospital to seek medical attention. After reporting to the emergency room, she was placed on an x-ray table. While this table was being rotated to an upright position, the foot stand became loose and/or broke away causing Ms. Tatrai to fall from the table and to be injured. Appellant commenced this action in trespass and assumpsit against Presbyterian Hospital alleging negligence and a breach of warranty of the safety of appellee\u2019s equipment and services. The Court of Common Pleas entered a verdict for the hospital finding that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (Act), Act of June 2, 1915, as amended, December 5, 1974, P.L. 782, No. 263, 77 P.S. \u00a7 481 provides an exclusive remedy and therefore bars appellant\u2019s action. The lower court found that the medical treatment given to appellant was provided to her as an employee in the normal course of her employment, and further held that her presence in the emergency department was required. The Superior Court affirmed the action of the Court of Common Pleas, 284 Pa.Super. 300, 425 A.2d 823. The issue presented in this appeal is whether Presbyterian University Hospital, appellee, may effectively defend a common law action for alleged negligence causing injury to one of its employees by virtue of the exclusivity provision of Section 303 of the Act. 77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a) (Supp. 1981-82). For the following reasons we disagree with the Superior Court and hold that appellant herein was entitled to institute suit against appellee.\nSection 303(a) provides that in return for the benefit of strict liability the employee receives under the Act, the employee surrenders his or her rights to any form of compensation for any injury occurring in the course of employment other than that provided under the terms of the Act. Here there is no question that appellee was an employee at the time of the alleged injury. The disputed question is whether the injury occurred in the course of the employment. The employer\u2019s claimed immunity to the negligence action instituted by appellant is dependent upon a finding that this injury occurred during the course of the appellant\u2019s employment.\nSection 301(c)(1) defines an injury arising in the course of employment as follows:\n.. . The term \u2018injury arising in the course of employment\u2019 as used in this article, . . . shall include all other injuries sustained while the employe is actually engaged in the furtherance of the business or affairs of the employer, whether upon the employer\u2019s premises or elsewhere, and shall include all injuries caused by the condition of the premises or by the operation of the employer\u2019s business or affairs thereon, sustained by the employe, who, though not so engaged, is injured upon the premises occupied by or under the control of the employer, or upon which the employer\u2019s business or affairs are being carried on, the employe\u2019s presence thereon being required by the nature of his employment.\nAs amended March 29, 1972, P.L. 159, No. 61, \u00a7 7, 77 P.S. \u00a7 411.\nThis section has been interpreted as specifying two distinct categories of injuries arising in the course of employment. Naugle v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, - Pa. Commonwealth Ct. - n. 2, 435 A.2d 295 n. 2 (1981); Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board v. U.S. Steel Corp., 31 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 329, 376 A.2d 271 (1977); Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board v. L. L. Stearns and Sons, 20 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 244, 341 A.2d 543 (1975); cf. Thomas v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 55 Commonwealth Ct. 449, 423 A.2d 784 (1980). The first category relates to those injuries that are sustained while the employee is actually engaged in the furtherance of the business of the employer, regardless of the physical location of the injury. Dolan v. Lintons Lunch, 397 Pa. 114, 152 A.2d 887 (1959); McIntyre v. Stausser, 365 Pa. 507, 76 A.2d 220 (1950); Butrin v. Manion Steel Barrel Co., 361 Pa. 166, 63 A.2d 345 (1949). The second relates to injuries occurring on the premises of the employer. Epler v. North American Rockwell Corp., 482 Pa. 391, 393 A.2d 1163 (1978); Morucci v. Susquehanna Collieries Co., 297 Pa. 508, 147 A. 533 (1929); Del Rossi v. Pa. Turnpike Comm\u2019n, 210 Pa.Super.Ct. 485, 233 A.2d 597 (1967); Eberle v. Union Dental Co., 182 Pa.Super.Ct. 519, 128 A.2d 136 (1956); Kosavage v. State Workmen\u2019s Insurance Fund, 109 Pa.Super. 231, 167 A. 473 (1933).\nWith reference to the first category the coverage of the Act is dependent upon a showing that the employee was \u201cactually engaged in the furtherance\u201d of the employer\u2019s affairs. The employer relies heavily on the stipulation that appellant was directed to go to the emergency room by her supervisor at the onset of her illness. While the direction of the employer or its agent may shed some light on the question of whether the injury occurred while the employee was \u201cactively engaged in the furtherance\u201d of the employer\u2019s affairs, it is not conclusive on that point. The mere direction to engage in the activity is not sufficient if that activity was not in furtherance of the employer\u2019s business. Butrin v. Manion Steel Barrel Co., supra; Martin v. S. W. Ins. Fund, et al., 108 Pa.Super.Ct. 570, 165 A. 514 (1933); Bock v. Reading, 120 Pa.Super.Ct. 468, 182 A. 732 (1936), and cases therein cited; Hoffman v. Montgomery, 146 Pa.Super.Ct. 399, 401, 22 A.2d 762, 763 (1941).\nThe employer attempts to embellish his argument by asserting that immediate care of one of its employees who becomes ill while engaged in the employment provides protection not only for the employee but also for the employer\u2019s patients. They stress the need in the health care service area of having alert and physically sound workers. They also argue that the employee\u2019s pay continued during the time she was receiving the emergency treatment.\nWe find it to be a tenuous proposition to argue that the indirect benefit to the employer of a healthy employee satisfies the statutory requirement of being actually engaged in the furtherance of the employer\u2019s business. It would ignore reality to deny the fact that the employee\u2019s purpose in seeking medical aid was primarily for her own benefit. While the maintenance of good health is of course of incidental value to the employer, the primary beneficiary is the employee whose well being is served.\nThe facts here are clearly distinguishable from those presented in Griffin v. Acme Coal Co., 161 Pa.Super.Ct. 28, 54 A.2d 69 (1947). In Griffin, claimant reported to the office at defendant\u2019s mine, where he was employed, for the purpose of receiving his pay. Mr. Griffin did not work on that particular day and while waiting to receive his pay in the office where payment was customarily made, he fell over a board and sustained injuries which totally disabled him. The court found that claimant was in the course of his employment and therefore found the injury to be compensable. The theory of that decision was that payment is an integral part of the employment scheme. The facts also indicated in that case that it was regular practice for employees to receive payment in the manner that was employed in that case.\nHere, we are dealing with an event totally extraneous to the employment scheme. The onset of illness interrupted the employee\u2019s activities pursuant to her employment and rendered her incapable of continuing those responsibilities. The purpose of going to the emergency room was to ameliorate the disability, not to continue the performance of the employer\u2019s affairs. The fact that her prompt recovery would hasten her return to her normal activities does not alter the fact that the immediate purpose of seeking the treatment was personal.\nNeither are we impressed by the fact that appellant\u2019s pay continued while she received emergency treatment. Nothing in this record suggests that if the employee had sought to utilize private resources she would not have received her pay for the day. Moreover, although there was a specific unit provided by the employer for employee health services, the employee in this instance went to and was injured in the emergency service which was open for the general public. The hospital billed Blue Cross for the treatment rendered as it would have for a member of the general public.\nFrom the foregoing it is therefore apparent that the employer has not shown the instant injury fits within the first category of the definition of an injury within the course of employment. We therefore must now consider the applicability of the Act in view of the fact that the injury was sustained on the premises and caused by a condition of the premises of the employer. The requirements for compensation where the lynchpin for liability is dependent upon the occurrence of the injury upon the premises is threefold. It must be shown that the injury was caused by the condition of the premises or by the operation of the employer\u2019s business; that the injured employee, though not so engaged, was in fact injured upon the employer\u2019s premises; and the employee\u2019s presence thereon was required by the nature of the employment.\nIt is clear the legislature intended to provide coverage under the Act in instances where the employee is injured upon the premises, although not actually engaged in his duties as an employee at the time of the event. This provision, however, is qualified by the requirement that the employee\u2019s presence at the time of the injury was due to the nature of the employer\u2019s business. Thus in cases where the nature of employment was such that the employee was required to be on or about the premises during an interval when he was not directly engaged in his assigned task, the employee was nevertheless covered by the Act and the injury compensable even though it was sustained while the employee was engaged in a personal mission. Henry v. Lit Brothers, 193 Pa.Super.Ct. 543, 165 A.2d 406 (1960) (compensation was allowed when claimant was injured during his lunch hour while he was engaged in a game of football after eating in the employees\u2019 cafeteria; employer encouraged employees to use the cafeteria, furnished a recreation room and permitted the use of the yard for athletic games); Haas v. Brotherhood of Transportation Workers, 158 Pa.Super.Ct. 291, 44 A.2d 776 (1945) (compensation allowed when decedent answered and was attacked by third person who inquired whether any union officials of the company were in the building); Morrow v. James S. Murray & Sons, 136 Pa.Super.Ct. 277, 7 A.2d 109 (1939) (compensation allowed where truck driver had prior to work engaged in setting off firecrackers with co-employee; however, at the time he was injured by firecracker in his employer\u2019s truck he had reported to work); Oldinsky v. R. & R. C. & I Co., 92 Pa.Super.Ct. 328 (1927) (compensation allowed when decedent during his lunch hour jumped in chute on employer\u2019s premises to take a ride and was suffocated); General Electric Co. v. Pa. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 50 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 45, 412 A.2d 196 (1980) (compensation allowed when claimant was returning from vending area and co-worker\u2019s soft drink splashed in claimant\u2019s face causing him to fall).\nIn each of these instances it was clear that the presence on the facility of the employer was required under the terms of employment and/or facilitated the orderly and expeditious disposition of the employer\u2019s affairs. Here, the concern was the health of the employee and the employee\u2019s presence upon the premises at the time of the injury was only a fortuitous circumstance.\nAt the time of appellant\u2019s illness there was no doctor on duty at the Employee Health Service. Ms. Tatrai therefore went to the hospital emergency room which was open to members of the general public. The sole reason appellant went to the emergency room was for treatment of her illness. Upon her arrival to the emergency facility, Ms. Tatrai was treated as a paying patient and like any other member of the general public. Since Ms. Tatrai\u2019s presence in the emergency room was not in furtherance of the affairs of her employer and was not required by reason of her employment, we must conclude that Workmen\u2019s Compensation is not her exclusive remedy. There is no reason to distinguish appellant from any other member of the public injured during the course of treatment. The risk of injury which appellant suffered was a risk to which any member of the general public receiving like treatment would have been subjected. The occurrence of the injury was not made more likely by the fact of her employment.\nThe Order of the Superior Court affirming the Common Pleas Court is reversed and the complaint is reinstated.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which O\u2019BRIEN, C. J., and LARSEN and FLAHERTY, JJ., joined.\nKAUFFMAN and WILKINSON, JJ., did not participate in the decision of this case.\n. Section 303(a) provides:\nThe liability of an employer under this act shall be exclusive and in place of any and all other liability to such employees, ... on account of any injury ... as defined in section 301(c)(1)... [Emphasis added.]\nAs amended December 5, 1974, P.L. 782, No. 263, \u00a7 6, 77 P.S. \u00a7 481.\n. The parties have stipulated that appellant was injured when the footstand of the x-ray table became loose and/or broke. The parties do not dispute that appellant\u2019s injuries were caused by a condition of the premises."}
