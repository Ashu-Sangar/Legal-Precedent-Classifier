{"id": "464148", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn the opinion of the Superior Court in this Workmen\u2019s Compensation case appears the following statement: \u201cIt is plain to us that on the record before us, claimant\u2019s average weekly wage is to be determined under sub-section (d) [of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 21, 1939, P. L. 520, Section 1, 77 P.S. 582]. . . . But claimant\u2019s complete employment record, at least for the year immediately before the accident, should have been introduced into evidence.\u201d\nAt the argument we directed that a stipulation be filed by the respective parties showing what the appellant\u2019s weekly wages were during the entire period of her employment. This has been done. There is nothing in the stipulation which would justify the holding that appellant\u2019s employment was on a weekly basis. The Superior Court was warranted in concluding that there was no competent evidence to support the finding that the employee\u2019s weekly wage was $20.00.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed on the opinion of Judge Kenworthey and the record is remitted to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board for further proceedings in accordance with that opinion."}
