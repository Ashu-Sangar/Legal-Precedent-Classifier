Whether the Superior Court erred in imposing upon electric utilities a burdensome and unprecedented duty to enter customers\u2019 premises and inspect customers\u2019 electrical facilities before restoring power after an outage?\n2. Whether the Superior Court overlooked the deleterious effects of its ruling upon public health and safety, in that by requiring utilities to inspect customers\u2019 premises before restoring power, the new duty created by the Superior Court will delay utilities\u2019 efforts to restore power after storms and other outages?\n3. Whether the Superior Court overlooked undisputed facts of record that undermine the rationale of its decision?"}
