{"id": "1051907", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nThe Trustees of the Proprietors of Kingston, a Pennsylvania corporation, claiming to be the owners in fee of a certain tract of land in Luzerne County, sued the Kingston Coal Company, a like corporation, alleging the latter held part of the premises in question under a long term lease, and defendant had committed waste by mining coal therefrom, during six years immediately preceding suit, to the value of $2,000, which plaintiff sought to recover.\nThe evidence being principally documentary, with no contest over material facts, the trial judge directed a verdict for plaintiff, but the court in banc entered judgment for defendant n. o. v.; this appeal followed.\nIn colonial times, both Pennsylvania and Connecticut claimed sovereignty over the territory which contains the property in dispute; a Connecticut organization, called the Susquehanna Company, made grants to emigrants from that colony for lands within what was knoivn as the \u201cSeventeen Townships of Luzerne County,\u201d and also appropriated certain lots in each township to \u201cthe public use,\u201d these latter being under the control of town committees. The Connecticut claims were not conceded by this State, and the controversy led to actual warfare between Pennsylvania and Connecticut settlers, wherein' much blood was shed and hard feelings engendered; taking cognizance of these conditions, Congress appointed commissioners to settle the controverted questions of sovereignty and title, who, by the Decree of Trenton, 1782, unanimously decided in favor of Pennsylvania; for historical data see Barney v. Sutton, 2 Watts 31, 33, et seq.; Enslin v. Bowman, 6 Binney 462, 466; Mitchell v. Smith, 1 Binney 109, 115.\nThere were numerous diverse individual claims to much of the land embraced in the territory covered by the Decree of Trenton, with controversies relating thereto between Pennsylvania and Connecticut settlers, and also between members of the latter class claiming against one another. To solve this sad state of affairs, several acts of assembly were passed, one in 1795 (3 Smith\u2019s Laws 209) entitled \u201cAn Act to prevent intrusions on lands within the counties of......Luzerne,\u201d prescribing penalties for anyone, not possessing title derived from Pennsylvania, who might intrude upon or deal in such lands, or combine with others so to do; and another in 1799 (3 Smith\u2019s Laws 362), which provided, inter alia, for compensation to Pennsylvania claimants, and for the appointment of commissioners to determine disputes over lands in the seventeen townships, with power to grant certificates and patents to such Connecticut claimants as were actual settlers upon the land at or before the time of the Decree of Trenton, but the act permitted only such \u201coriginal settlers, their heirs or assigns,\u201d to apply for or obtain certificates and patents: see also supplemental statutes, 3 Smith\u2019s Laws 366, et seq., and id. p. 526.\nDecember 28, 1799, Lot No. 4, held for public use by plaintiff\u2019s predecessors, was conveyed to one Lawrence Myers, a Connecticut claimant, who, by way of exchange, deeded to his grantors Lot No. 5, the premises now in dispute, \u201cin trust for the use of the people of said Township of Kingston.\u201d April 3, 1800, the town committee executed a deed, purporting to idease and demise\u201d the lot thus acquired (No. 5), for 999 years, to Daniel Hoyt, \u201chis heirs and assigns,\u201d that is to say, all \u201crite, possession, interest and claim\u201d which, they were \u201cimpowered by lease to convey.\u201d Hoyt signed this instrument, agreeing to pay $40.20 annually for six years and, at the expiration of the seventh year, a further sum of $710.20, no mention being made as to mining or mining rights. On the same day, Hoyt executed a mortgage for $670, covering Lot No. 5 and an adjoining lot. No. 6, to the town committee, containing a general warranty of title, purporting a fee absolute in the mortgagor. The lease and mortgage were both recorded.\nJanuary 3,1800, prior to the date of the last mentioned instruments, Hoyt had entered an application for Lots Nos. 5 and 6, and, October 20,1801, he filed his \u201coath of single title\u201d; December 1, 1802,. a survey was made to him, and, January 16,1804, the commissioners under the Act of 1799 certified that he was the owner. On February 4, 1806, a warrant issued to Hoyt, reciting payment of purchase money by him; and, February 21, 1806, the survey was duly returned. March 29, 1806, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania issued a patent to \u201cDaniel Hoyt, his heirs and assigns,\u201d to \u201chave and to hold the said tract or parcel of land [Lots Nos. 5 and 6] forever, free and clear of all restrictions and reservations, as to mines, royalties, quit-rents, or otherwise.\u201d Since 1800 Hoyt and his successors have paid all taxes.\nApril 1, 1874, Samuel Hoyt, a grandson of Daniel, executed a coal lease to Waterman and Beaver, embracing within its description 59y2 acres of Lot 5. While showing the chain of title to this lease, defendant proved several duly recorded fee simple deeds, bearing dates prior to 1822, from Daniel Hoyt to various vendees, for parts of the land in controversy, still other portions passing under Hoyt\u2019s will, and all being traced down, by numerous deeds, wills, and judicial proceedings, to the lessor in the coal lease of 1874, and, by like means, from the lessees named in that instrument to the Kingston Coal Company, the present defendant; in each instance the estate or interest involved was treated as though a fee had vested in the original patentee. Mining under the lease of 1874 began in that year, a bore-hole and air-shaft showing upon the surface in 1895.\nFrom 1800 to 1913, when this suit was commenced, plaintiff and its predecessors appear never to have asserted any right of ownership or property in Lot No. 5; but, to sustain the present action, it now contends that, Daniel Hoyt having accepted the town committee lease in 1800, the patent from Pennsylvania, which issued to him in 1806, immediately accrued to the benefit of his landlord, and, to that end, the patentee took the legal title in trust. Therefore, plaintiff says, despite the grant from the State, Hoyt and his successors held possession merely as tenants, and were guilty of waste the moment they commenced to depreciate the value of the reversion by mining coal.\nPlaintiff seeks to sustain its position in various ways. First, it contends that, since Daniel Hoyt, on the application for the certificate which led to his patent, noted the lease of 1800, he then admitted holding thereunder. In view of relevant legislation requiring him to mention and deliver up to the commissioners all documents of title which he possessed (not merely those upon which he relied), we fail to see that the notation in question, at this great length of time, should be given the controlling significance claimed for it, particularly considering the counterbalancing fact that plaintiff\u2019s predecessors accepted from Hoyt, on the very date of the alleged lease, a mortgage wherein the latter warranted an absolute title to Lot No. 5 as being in himself.\nIf Myers, who conveyed the land in controversy to plaintiff\u2019s predecessors, was, as now asserted by it, a Connecticut claimant, then, under the Act of 1799, he, and those to whom he transferred his alleged interest or estate, were bound by the certificate and patent issued to Hoyt (Dailey v. Avery, 4 S. & R. 280, 287-8; Enslin v. Bowman, 6 Binney 462, 469, 472; Strickland v. Strickland, 6 S. & R. 93, 101; Shepherd v. Com., 1 S. & R. 1, 14; Perkins v. Gay, 3 S. & R. 325, 327, 330), and, after this great lapse of time, considering the numerous changes which have taken place, it is rather late to attack the title thus gained; but, plaintiff says, we do not attack the patent, our contention is that, while the title out of the Commonwealth to Hoyt was perfectly good, by reason of a well established rule of law the patentee held the title, thus gained, in trust for his landlord, and we, as the successors of that landlord, now have a right to so assert. There are, however, several conclusive answers to this contention.\nPlaintiff\u2019s immediate predecessors, in 1800, w'hen the Hoyt lease was made, held such possible rights as they might then have possessed in Lot No. 5, as assignees of a Connecticut claimant (Myers); and, so far as this record shows, neither he, they nor anyone before them had ever made an effort to assert, prove, or have certified in or by a Pennsylvania tribunal their (now alleged) incipient title. No matter how much, upon the showing of special equities, we afterwards may have wavered on the subject, at the date in question \u2014 both under the Act of 1795, supra, and on general principles (Mitchell v. Smith, 1 Binney, 109, 120, 121, 123) \u2014all deeds, leases, and other contracts, purporting to transfer uncertified claims of Connecticut settlers (except as expressly permitted by the statutes of Pennsylvania), were considered unlawful and void (Mitchell v. Smith, supra, p. 123; Enslin v. Bowman, 6 Binney 462, 466; Dailey v. Avery, 4 S. & R. 280, 288); this being the case, so far as the rights of those claiming through the Hoyt patent are concerned, the earlier lease to him can and, after such a lapse of time, should be treated as a void instrument \u2014 in accord with the prevailing rules of law in 1800; and that is so without regard to what rights between the original parties might have been judicially declared, if sooner asserted, under different conditions, when the real purpose intended to be accomplished was capable of ascertainment, determination and enforcement, without any question of prejudice to the rights of others, who purchased subsequent to, and in reliance upon, the patent.\nTrue, the Act of April 8, 1826, P. L. 270, provides that \u201cThe relation of landlord and tenant shall exist and be held as fully and effectually between Connecticut settlers and Pennsylvania claimants, as between other citizens of this Commonwealth, on the trial of any cause now pending or hereafter to be brought within this Commonwealth\u201d; but this cannot be taken to mean that, when an estate in landed property has been treated, for more than a century, as a fee out of the Commonwealth, nevertheless the relation of landlord and tenant must be held to exist, under a lease executed prior to the original patent, so as, in effect, to vest the fee simple title (declared by the State to be in the patentee) in the lessor and its successors, thus giving to them the benefit of a patent, which, so far as the record indicates, they could not have obtained lawfully for themselves. We make the last statement, for the reason that, since Hoyt (the person named as tenant in the lease) was successful before the legal tribunal authorized to act in the premises, it must now be conclusively presumed he was the sole \u201cactual\u201d settler entitled, and that plaintiff\u2019s predecessors, as well as Myers, who conveyed to them, had no legal right whatever to a certificate or patent: Griffin v. Fellows, 81* Pa. 114, 120.\nAt the time of the ancient transactions now under discussion, the rule that a tenant will not be heard to deny his landlord\u2019s title, would certainly not have been permitted to prevail against the public policy of this State that Connecticut settlers (representing a class who, on behalf of that colony, had attempted to usurp the sovereignty of Pennsylvania) should have no rights in the lands claimed by them, except such as might, .ex gratia, be recognized by the statutes of Pennsylvania: Dailey v. Avery, 4 S. & R. 280, 288. When the lease was made, in 1800, the only right given Connecticut settlers under our law, was to appear before the commissioners appointed by the Act of 1799, and there have their claims adjudicated; and, if satisfactory proof of actual settlement upon the land at or before the Decree of Trenton were presented, they might secure a certificate of title, to be followed by a patent: Enslin v. Bowman, 6 Binney 462, 468, 469.\nOf course, at this late day, it is impossible to know just what right of title Myers (who conveyed Lot No. 5 to plaintiff\u2019s predecessors) claimed; but it may be noted that, in the lease of 1800, his assignee, the town committee, apparently endeavored to select words of grant which would not obligate it to defend the possession of its tenant, restricting itself to letting what \u201crite\u201d or \u201cinterest\u201d it might be \u201cimpowered\u201d to convey \u201cby lease\u201d; which, to say the least, does not tend to make a strong case for the assertion, after a century, of the absolute right now sought to be enforced.\nThe Act of 1822, P. L. 97, incorporating plaintiff, does not help it, for several reasons, among others, because, so far as the statute affirms leases theretofore made by the Committee of the Proprietors of the Township of Kingston, it expressly applies only to those \u201cconcerning lands originally appropriated to the public use,\u201d and Lot No. 5 was not \u201coriginally\u201d so appropriated; again, section 5 of this statute, which provides that interests \u201cvested\u201d in \u201cany person or persons for the use of said proprietors [plaintiff\u2019s predecessors], shall vest in said corporation,\u201d fails plaintiff, because, for reasons already stated, it cannot be said, under the relevant facts as they existed, that any property rights were then \u201cvested\u201d in Hoyt \u201cfor the use of said proprietors.\u201d\nIf there were nothing else in this case, it is plain that plaintiff and its predecessors have slept too long on the alleged right now sought to be enforced; for, assuming, while not admitting, the correctness of the theory that, when the patent was issued to Hoyt, the latter held the title thus acquired in trust for his landlord, this would not be a dry trust which would execute itself. If the trust existed at all, it was a constructive one which had to be judicially established (Strimpfler v. Roberts, 18 Pa. 283, 302; McKean, etc., v. Clay, 149 Pa. 277) ; prior to the Act of 1856, P. L. 532, a proceeding for this purpose must have been commenced within 21 years from the inception of the alleged trust, and after that act '(section 6) within five years from the time such \u201ctrust accrued with the right of entry\u201d: McBarron v. Glass, 30 Pa. 133,135. Should we assume the correctness of plaintiff\u2019s theory, it is apparent that, when mining commenced, waste was committed, which gave a right of reentry (Griffin v. Fellows, 81\u00bd Pa. 114, 122; Trustees of Kingston v. L. V. C. Co., 236 Pa. 350, 357) if plaintiff could judicially establish the trust for which it contends, and thus set aside the title of those who were taking the coal; but such trust would have to be established, if at all, within five years from the time the first mining was done, which gave the \u201cright of entry,\u201d or, in the words of the statute, from the time \u201cthe trust accrued with the right of entry.\u201d\nThere is authority for the position that an action of waste, involving no question of plaintiff\u2019s title, may be brought at any time during the period of the spoliation, recoverable damages being restricted to losses incurred during the last sis years (Trustees of Kingston v. L. V. C. Co., 241 Pa. 469, 473) ; but if, in such a proceeding, one depends upon the establishment of a trust to sustain his title to the land in question, the action must be brought within the statutory period, the same as though the prime purpose of the suit were to \u201cenforce [an] implied or resulting trust as to realty\u201d: Sec. 6, Act of 1856, supra.\nAn actual Connecticut settler within the meaning of the Act of 1799, supra, had such a possibility of title that encumbrances, etc., created by him would bind the land, if an estate were subsequently patented to him or his assignees (Carkhuff v. Anderson, 3 Binney 3; Bird v. Smith, 8 Watts 434) ; moreover, if a lease were created by such a claimant, and he afterwards obtained a patent for the land, he could not, as against his lessee, or the latter\u2019s assignees, deny the validity of the contract : Providence Trustee\u2019s App., 2 Walker 37; Griffin v. Fellows, supra. This, however, is far from saying that, if a mere Connecticut claimant made a lease and the demised land were shortly afterwards patented to the lessee, also a Connecticut claimant, the title thus solemnly adjudged to the latter will be held to accrue to the former, in a case like the present, where the alleged (landlord) rights of such lessor are no way acknowledged, exercised or asserted until more than a century has run, during all of which time title has been treated and marketed as a fee simple in the lessee under a patent out of the Commonwealth.\nThe case before us is quite different from Satterlee v. Matthewson, 16 S. & R. 169, cited by plaintiff; there the action was ejectment, and against the original lessee. At the first trial of the cause, plaintiff recovered, although defendant set up a patent from the Commonwealth antedating the lease; which patent had been purchased on his behalf after the term commenced. We reversed because the tenancy, having arisen out of a contract between Connecticut settlers, was void: see 13 S. & R. 133. Before the next trial, the Act of 1826, supra, was passed, and, holding that it validated the tenancy, we sustained a verdict for plaintiff; but Huston, J., who wrote the opinion, said (p. 178) he was satisfied the patent purchased by the defendant did not cover the land in dispute. Be this as it may, the case is distinguishable from the one at bar, as either the original parties to the contract or others directly representing them still had possession, not only when the litigation arose but when the validating Act of 1826, supra, was passed; while here the litigation did not arise until 112 years after the alleged lease, when, of course, all the original parties had long since passed away, and the record shows many conveyances from the patentee, presumably to bona fide purchasers, recorded prior to the passage of the Act of 1826. In connection with the cases just discussed, see Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Peters 380.\nA final point urged by defendant against plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, is that, since the original grants from the Susquehanna Company reserved for future disposal \u201call beds of mine, iron, ore and coal,\u201d and since it is conceded the lease to Hoyt did not include mineral rights, therefore the coal here in controversy never passed under that instrument, or vested in anyone else than the patentee of the Commonwealth, and, as to that particular estate, Hoyt was no other than an owner in fee; which, so far as the coal is concerned, excludes the relation of landlord and tenant with all its incidents. It is not necessary to do more than mention this contention, for we deem the broader grounds previously discussed sufficient to sustain the judgment about to be entered.\nWe conclude that, on the facts at bar, defendant was fully warranted in resting upon the Hoyt patent (Balliot v. Bauman, 5 W. & S. 150; Woodward, J., in Grotz v. Lehigh & W. Coal Co., 1 Kulp 53, 54); but, as already shown, even should we go back of that instrument, defendant\u2019s title cannot now be successfully attacked; therefore plaintiff has no substantial ground to complain of the judgment entered by the court below, which is accordingly affirmed."}
