The Superior Court failed to apply the mandate of Pennsylvania Criminal Procedural Rule 1100(a)(4), formerly set at Rule 1100(a)(3), providing that the date of transfer of a court case from the juvenile court to the trial or criminal division is the operative date for computing the time within which a trial must commence."}
