{"id": "1755403", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nThis is an appeal by the natural mother from the final decree entered in the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, decreeing the adoption of R.W.B. by A.W.U. and E.K.U.\nR.W.B., the subject of this adoption proceeding, was born on December 18, 1976 in Cheverlyn, Maryland. His natural parents, C.W. and R.L.W., were separated at the time of his birth and were divorced on June 27, 1977. R.L.W. has never seen or supported his son. C.W. has another child, D.M.B., born out of wedlock on October 15, 1975. R.L.W. is not the father of D.M.B. R.W.B. was given his mother\u2019s maiden name and, thus, the same last name as D.M.B.\nOn February 11, 1977, when R.W.B. was approximately six weeks of age, C.W. arranged for his adoption by A.W.U. and E.K.U. The prospective adopting parents took custody of the child at C.W.\u2019s home in Maryland and returned with him to their home in Uniontown, Fayette County, Pennsylvania. Six days later, on February 17, 1977, C.W. traveled to Uniontown and consented in writing to the adoption of R.W.B. in the office of counsel for the adopting parents. Approximately six months later, in August 1977, C.W. informed A.W.U. and E.K.U. that she wanted the child returned. Nevertheless, on September 6, 1977, A.W.U. and E.K.U. filed a petition for the adoption of R.W.B.\nFollowing notice to all parties, the first hearing on the petition was held on September 28,1977. At that time, only the adopting parents testified. C.W., stating in advance that her mother whom she needed as a witness was confined to bed and unable to travel to the hearing on that date, did not appear. A subsequent hearing, set for October 12, 1977, was rescheduled to November 3, 1977 due to the hearing judge\u2019s illness. On November 3, 1977, C.W. appeared without counsel and the matter was rescheduled to November 17, 1977. C.W. was absent on that date due to the death of her father. On November 29, 1977, C.W., represented by counsel, appeared and testified that she did not consent to the adoption.\nAt the conclusion of the second hearing, the parties were advised a decision would be withheld pending receipt of a report from Child Welfare Services. Prior to receiving the report, the hearing judge retired from office and the parties stipulated the matter should be decided on the existing record and without further testimony. On April 26, 1978, the court decreed the adoption of R.W.B. by the petitioners. The court concluded R.W.B.\u2019s natural father and mother had abandoned him within the meaning of section 311(1) of the Adoption Act, Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, No. 208, art. III, \u00a7 311(1), 1 P.S. \u00a7 311(1) (Supp.1978-79) [Hereinafter: Adoption Act], thus making parental consent to the adoption unnecessary.\nSection 311(1) of the Adoption Act states the following grounds for involuntary termination of parental rights:\n\u201c(1) The parent by conduct continuing for a period of at least six months either has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to a child, or has refused or failed to perform parental duties.\u201d\nThis Court has held that section 311(1) must be read in the disjunctive and termination of parental rights may be ordered if the evidence establishes either a \u201csettled purpose\u201d to relinquish parental claim for a period of at least six months or a failure to perform parental duties for the same length of time. See In re Adoption of P., 475 Pa. 197, 380 A.2d 311 (1977) and cases cited therein. In the instant case, the court concluded termination was justified on both grounds enumerated in section 311(1).\nIn reviewing such a conclusion, we must review the testimony and determine whether the findings of fact upon which the conclusion is based are supported by competent evidence. Fleming, supra; In re Adoption of Farabelli, 460 Pa. 423, 333 A.2d 846 (1975). Additionally, the adopting parents had the burden of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that the statutory requirements for involuntary termination were met, Fleming, supra; In re Adoption of McCray, 460 Pa. 210, 215, n. 4, 331 A.2d 652, 654, n. 4 (1975), and we may review the conclusion of the court as to this.\nThe involuntary termination by law of a natural parent\u2019s right to his or her child is a harsh measure carrying serious consequences for both parent and child which a court should grant only where clearly warranted by a preponderance of the evidence. Fleming, supra; In re Adoption of McAhren, 460 Pa. 63, 331 A.2d 419 (1975); Sarver Adoption Case, 444 Pa. 507, 281 A.2d 890 (1971). This is not such a case.\nA \u201csettled purpose\u201d to relinquish parental claims requires a deliberate decision by the parent to terminate the parental relationship, and the parent must persist in that determination throughout the six-month period. Fleming, supra; Farabelli, supra. Thus, this Court has required an \u201c \u2018affirmative indication of a positive intent,\u2019 \u201d see McAhren, supra, 460 Pa. at 70, 331 A.2d at 423, as well as a \u201cfinality of purpose,\u201d see Wolfe Adoption Case, 454 Pa. 550, 554, 312 A.2d 793 (1973), before sustaining a conclusion of a \u201csettled purpose.\u201d Moreover, any action by the parent within the six-month period inconsistent with such \u201csettled purpose\u201d will preclude an involuntary termination of that parent\u2019s rights. See Sarver, supra.\nSpecifically, we have held that a recanted voluntary termination petition will not support an involuntary termination on \u201csettled purpose\u201d grounds when the petition was withdrawn before a final decree of termination, even though custody had been relinquished for over six months. Fleming, supra; Wolfe, supra; Sheaffer Appeal, 452 Pa. 165, 305 A.2d 36 (1973). Further, this Court has held that evidence of parental inaction and lack of interest in excess of six months will not conclusively establish a \u201csettled purpose\u201d to relinquish. Farabelli, supra; Wolfe, supra.\nIt is clear from the record in this case that the natural mother contacted the adopting parents to make arrangements for placing R.W.B. in their custody. She was not present when the actual transfer of custody took place, but six days later she traveled to Pennsylvania to give her written consent to his adoption. However, these events occurred shortly after R.W.B.\u2019s birth when she was physically ill and emotionally upset as a result of incidents of harassment by her estranged husband and his girl friend including shots fired at her home, an arson fire at her home, and an attempted kidnapping of R.W.B. During this period, C.W., who was under a doctor\u2019s care, left R.W.B. with a friend for six days in an attempt to restore her health and regain emotional stability. When problems continued, C.W. decided the child would be safer and better cared for by someone else and, thus, contacted the prospective adopting parents.\nC.W. testified she and the adopting parents agreed that they would send her photographs of the baby and that she would be known as the child\u2019s aunt. She was to see him \u201conce in awhile\u201d when she could travel to Pennsylvania. Further, C.W. acknowledged signing a consent form but stated she did not read it and was told it was a consent to custody by the adopting parents until the adoption. In an interview with Child Welfare Services, C.W. stated it was agreed that she would be present at court proceedings legalizing the adoption and that she reserved the right to change her mind. C.W. testified she began to change her mind about giving up the child as soon as she saw him on February 17, 1977 in Pennsylvania. C.W. and the adopting parents remained in contact by telephone throughout the spring and summer. These calls were sometimes initiated by C.W. and sometimes by the adopting parents. Although C.W. missed the child progressively more, she had no money for a trip to Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, her husband\u2019s harassment ceased after she relinquished custody of the child.\nIn August 1977, C.W. called to tell the adopting parents she was coming to obtain the return of the child. By the time she arranged for a car and the necessary money to travel to Pennsylvania, she received notice that a hearing on the adoption petition filed September 6, 1977 was scheduled for September 28, 1977, so she postponed her trip until that date. C.W. did not appear at the first and at one other scheduled hearing due to her mother\u2019s illness and the death of her father. However, she did make two trips to Pennsylvania to attend scheduled hearings before she was finally permitted to testify and withdraw her consent to the adoption on November 29, 1977.\nIn light of undisputed evidence that the natural mother\u2019s decision to allow adoption of her child was made during a time of severe emotional distress and uncontradicted evidence that the mother wavered in her determination to give up the child from the time she relinquished physical custody until approximately six months later when she asked for his return, the decision cannot be considered a \u201cdeliberate\u201d one. Hence, on this record, we cannot agree the court\u2019s conclusion of a \u201csettled purpose\u201d to relinquish parental claim is supported by the facts.\nThe court below also justified termination of C.W.\u2019s parental rights on a conclusion that C.W. failed to perform parental duties for at least six months. We cannot sustain such a determination when it is based, as in this case, on a finding of a temporary failure or inability which results from a parent\u2019s personal crisis. In re Adoption of P., supra; Matter of Kapcsos, 468 Pa. 50, 360 A.2d 174 (1976); Re: Adoption of M.T.T., 467 Pa. 88, 354 A.2d 564 (1976). Pennsylvania case law recognizes a parent may fulfill his or her responsibility for parental duties in such a situation by making reasonable arrangements for the temporary care of a child. In re Adoption of P., supra; Wolfe, supra. _\nThe record in this case reveals a mother who was under stress and unable to properly care for her child as a result of acts of harassment by the child\u2019s father. She transferred custody, of the child to a couple known to her on the condition that she be allowed to visit him. Despite her limited finances, she made frequent telephone calls to inquire about the child. After approximately six months, when the harassment stopped and C.W. regained emotional control, she reevaluated the situation and determined she could, after all, care for the child. Under these circumstances, we must view the transfer of the child to persons who could provide better care as temporary and a result of the mother\u2019s personal crisis. Thus, on these facts, we cannot sustain an involuntary termination based on failure to perform parental duties.\nDecree reversed. Each party to pay own costs.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Section 731 of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, 20 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 731, provides as follows:\n\u201cAny judge of an orphans\u2019 court division, whether or not it consists of more than one judge, may hear and determine all matters jurisdiction of which is exercised through the orphans\u2019 court division. His determination thereof shall be a final decree, unless exceptions thereto are authorized by rule of court or the decree discloses that it is not intended as such.\" [Emphasis added.] Section 792 of the Probate Code, 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 792, provides that\n\u201c[a]ny party in interest who is aggrieved by a final order or decree of the orphans\u2019 court division, . may appeal therefrom . . .\u201d Supreme Court O.C. Rule 7.1 states that \u201c[exceptions shall be filed at such place and time, shall be in such form ... as local rules shall prescribe.\u201d [Emphasis added.] Since there is no rule of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Fayette County authorizing exceptions to be taken to an adoption decree, the decree in this case entered on April 26, 1978 is final and appellant\u2019s failure to file exceptions before appealing to this Court does not constitute a waiver of the issues raised on appeal under Supreme Court O.C. Rule 3.1 and Pa.R.C.P. 1518. See Estate of Miller, 467 Pa. 193, 355 A.2d 577 (1976). Cf. Estate of McGrorey, 474 Pa. 402, 378 A.2d 855 (1977); Estate of Stanley, 470 Pa. 483, 368 A.2d 1259 (1977); Estate of Rothermel, 461 Pa. 1, 334 A.2d 603 (1975).\n. Our cases have recognized that consent to adoption by the natural parent may be withdrawn at any time before entry of the final decree of adoption. In re Adoption of Baby Girl Fleming, 471 Pa. 73, 369 A.2d 1200 (1977); Chambers Appeal, 452 Pa. 149, 305 A.2d 360 (1973); Hunter Adoption Case, 421 Pa. 287, 218 A.2d 764 (1966).\n. Section 414 reads as follows:\n\u201c414. When consent not required; parent\nConsent of a parent to adoption shall not be required if a decree of termination with regard to such parent has been entered. When parental rights have not previously been terminated, the court may find that consent of a parent of the adoptee is not required if, after hearing as prescribed in section 313, the court finds that grounds exist for involuntary termination under section 311.\u201d\n. The court\u2019s opinion states that, for a nine-month period from the time of physical transfer to the date of the second hearing, \u201cthe only interest shown by the natural mother of the adoptee was an occasional telephone call to the adopting parents.\u201d The record, however, indicates there was regular and frequent communication between the mother and the adopting parents."}
