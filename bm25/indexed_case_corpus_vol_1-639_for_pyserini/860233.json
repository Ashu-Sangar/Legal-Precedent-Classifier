{"id": "860233", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Fell,\nThe learned judge of the common pleas, upon the hearing of the application for a preliminary injunction, distinctly found that the Director of the Department of Public Works of the City of Philadelphia \u201c had acted for what he considered the best interests of the city \u201d in awarding the contract for paving to the Mack Paving Company. A careful examination of the testimony has satisfied us that this finding was correct. There was no allegation, in the bill, nor any attempt in the testimony, to show that this officer acted in bad faith ; and throughout the whole proceeding his entire honesty of purpose and his thorough integrity seem to have been conceded.\nThere then remained but one question, and that related to the power of the director under the act of May 23,1874. The decree is based upon the opinion that the director had no alternative but to award the contract \u201c to the lowest bidder who is able pecuniarily to carry out his contract.\u201d This was a misconception of the law as it has been repeatedly announced by this court.\nThe construction of the act of 1874 was first before this court in 1876 in the case of Commonwealth ex rel. Snyder v. Mitchell, 82 Pa. 343, and it was there distinctly held that the word \u201cresponsible\u201d as used in the 6th section meant more than the pecuniary ability of the bidder to carry out the contract, or to be answerable in damages for its breach, or to enter security for its performance; and that the act vested in the officer whose duty it was to award the contract a discretion, and that his-powers were not merely ministerial. This case was followed in the same year by Findley v. Pittsburg, 82 Pa. 351, in which the same view of the act was stated. The question again arose-in 1885 in Douglass v. The Commonwealth ex rel. Senior, 108 Pa. 559, and it was there said by Mercur, C. J.: \u201c The act of 23d May, 1874, directing contracts to be awarded to the \u2018 lowest responsible bidder \u2019 has twice been before us for construction. In each it was held that the word \u2018 responsible \u2019 as used in the act applies not to pecuniary ability only, but also to judgment and skill. The duties thereby imposed on the city authorities are not merely ministerial, limited to ascertaining whose bid was the lowest, and the pecuniary responsibility of the bidder and his sureties. The act calls for the exercise of' duties which are deliberative and discretionary.\u201d This doctrine was re-affirmed in 1891 in The American Paving Co. v. Wagner, 139 Pa. 623.\nIt therefore follows that under the findings of fact by the learned judge there was but one conclusion that was in harmony with the decided cases.\nThe decree of July 9,1894, granting an injunction, is reversed and set aside, and the injunction dissolved at the cost of the. appellee.\nMr. Justice Williams dissented.\nATKINSON ET AL. V. PHILA. ET AL., APPELLANTS.\nOpinion by\nMr. Justice Fell,\nOct. 29, 1894:\nThis case was argued with Interstate Vitrified Brick Co. v. The City of Philadelphia, No. 200 July Term, 1894, in which the opinion of this Court has been filed. It presents the same questions that were considered and decided in that case.\nThe decree of-July 9, 1894, is reversed and set aside, and the injunction is dissolved at the cost of the appellees.\nMr. Justice Williams dissented."}
