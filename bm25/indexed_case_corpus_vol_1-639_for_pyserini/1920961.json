{"id": "1920961", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Jones,\nThis appeal presents a very narrow issue: the validity of an order of the Superior Court quashing an appeal by a claimant in a workmen\u2019s compensation case.\nThis is a workmen\u2019s compensation case in which Henry Robinson (claimant), an employee of the Y.W.C.A. (employer), located on Allegheny Avenue, Philadelphia, alleged that, while on his way to report to work, he fell on an icy sidewalk in front of the Y.W.C.A. and was injured. The employer filed an answer to Robinson\u2019s petition denying that Robinson was in the course of his employment at the time he was injured. After a hearing before the referee, the referee entered an award for claimant finding that claimant had fallen on the \u201cpremises\u201d of his employer. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board (the Board) reversed the referee and found that the accideht \u201cdid not occur on the premises owned or under the control of the [Y.W.C.A.].\u201d\nClaimant then appealed to the Court of Common Pleas No. 5 of Philadelphia County and filed the required exceptions to the Board\u2019s order within the statutory period. Judge Joseph Sloane of that Court remanded the matter to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation authorities, holding: \u201cThe record does not support substituted Finding of Fact No. 7 made by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board. The record is bare of any showing whether Y.W.C.A. owned, leased or controlled that portion of the paved area abutting the Y.W.C.A. Building on which claimant fell. This case is remanded to the Board to take further testimony and make appropriate Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on whether or not claimant was on the premises owned, leased or controlled by Y.W.C.A.\u201d The employer then took an appeal to the Superior Court from Judge Sloane\u2019s remand order but this appeal was quashed. At the time of this appeal Judge Sloane wrote an additional opinion (under Rule 46 of the Superior Court) in which, elaborating on his order to remand, he stated, inter alia: \u201cWe did not affirm an award; we did not deny an award; we did not modify an award; we made no definitive order; we did not conclude the litigation.\u201d\nPursuant to Judge Sloane\u2019s order, the Board set aside its Finding of Fact No. 7 and remanded the case to the referee to take further testimony. After further hearing, the referee again made an award to claimant finding that the accident occurred on the premises of the employer. The Board again reversed the referee, finding that the accident did not occur on the employer\u2019s premises.\nClaimant appealed from the Board\u2019s order to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County but, inadvertently, the case was docketed under a different term and case number from that under which claim, ant\u2019s first appeal had been docketed. Claimant did not file exceptions to the Board\u2019s findings until almost five months subsequent to the date of the second appeal. In the Court of Common Pleas the employer moved to quash claimant\u2019s appeal because he had not filed timely exceptions to the Board\u2019s order. The Court of Common Pleas, although affirming the Board\u2019s order as to the merits and denying benefits to claimant, refused to quash the appeal.\nBoth claimant and the employer appealed to the Superior Court, the former from the court\u2019s order denying compensation and the latter from the court\u2019s order refusing to quash.\nThe principal question before the Superior Court was whether claimant\u2019s appeal was quashable, i.e., whether claimant was required to file a new appeal from the Board\u2019s second order or whether the Board\u2019s second order automatically came up for review as a \u201cpending\u201d action. More specifically, the question is whether the claimant on appeal to the Court of Common Pleas should have proceeded under the first or second subsection of \u00a7427 of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, \u00a7427, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7874.\nSection 427 provides as follows: \u201cAny court before whom an appeal is pending from any action of the board may remit the record to the board for more specific findings of fact, if the findings of the board or referee are not, in its opinion, sufficient to enable it to decide the question of law raised by the appeal.\n\u201cIf such court shall sustain the appellant\u2019s exceptions to a finding or findings of fact and reverse the action of the board founded thereon, the court shall remit the record to the board for further hearing and determination, in which the procedure shall be the same as that hereinbefore provided in this article in the case of a petition presented to the board, except that the testimony taken in the original proceedings shall be considered as though taken in such further hearing.\u201d (77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7877, 879)\nIn Driscoll v. McAlister Bros., Inc., 294 Pa. 169, 171, 172, 173, 144 A. 89 (1928), our Court distinguished the two portions of \u00a7427, stating, inter alia: \u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of June 26, 1919, P. L. 642,665, section 427, makes provision for the return of a record by the court of common pleas to the compensation board in two instances. It first states that, \u2018Any court before whom an appeal is pending from any action of the board may remit the record to the board for more specific findings of fact, if the findings of the board or referee are not, in its opinion, sufficient to enable it to decide the question of law raised by the appeal.\u2019 This provision is not intended to cover instances where the common pleas reverses an award because the findings are not sustained by competent evidence; such cases fall within another provision of the act, which we shall discuss later.\n\u201cThe above quoted provision plainly contemplates cases like the present, where the findings are not sufficiently specific for a reviewing tribunal to act intelligently on the complaints before it, and where the court, without disturbing the award, returns the record to have this defect remedied. In such instances, even after the record is returned to the board, the appeal is still \u2018pending\u2019 in the common pleas; and when the more specific findings are made by the compensation authorities (which should be done with expedition), the record must be sent back to that court.\n\u201cAs stated, the provision for the return of a record to the board, for the purpose of obtaining more specific findings of fact, contemplates that the appeal shall continue to pend in the court of common pleas while these findings are being made, for the provision in question particularly states that, \u2018Any court before whom an appeal is pending . . . may remit the record\u2019; and \u2018pending\u2019 means \u2018undecided, awaiting decision\u2019 (Century Dictionary), \u2018to be in process of settlement or adjustment\u2019: Anderson\u2019s and Black\u2019s Law Dictionaries.\n\u201cThe second provision contained in the act for returning the record to the board comprehends instances where the court reaches a final decision on the record as first made by the compensation authorities; it provides that \u2018If the court of common pleas . . . sustain the appellant\u2019s exceptions to a finding or findings of fact and reverse the action of the board founded thereon, the court shall remit the record to the board for further hearing and determination.\u2019 This is intended to cover cases where the court is convinced that the findings of fact are not sustained by legally competent evidence, and, therefore, such findings must fall as a matter of law; which, of course, requires a reversal of the award. The law, however, in such cases, affords a second opportunity for furnishing legally competent proofs.\u201d See also: Diaz v. Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp., 170 Pa. Superior Ct. 608, 616, 88 A. 2d 801 (1952).\nThe majority of the Superior Court found that Judge Sloane\u2019s remand order to the Board was made under the second section of \u00a7427, and, therefore, the claimant was required to take a new appeal which required filing exceptions within thirty days of notice of the new appeal and, since such exceptions were untimely filed, the appeal must be quashed. Judges Hoffman and Spaulding held that the matter was controlled by the first subsection of \u00a7427 and that, since the lower court had remanded the record to the Board for more specific findings of fact, claimant did not have to file, a new appeal and exceptions to the Board\u2019s order in order to perfect an appeal.\nWe are of the opinion that the first subsection of \u00a7427 controls and that the Superior Court erroneously quashed the appeal. A careful examination of the action taken by Judge Sloane clearly indicates that he remanded the matter to the Board for amplification of the record. In his memorandum opinion at the time his. order was made and in his opinion filed under Rule 46 of the Rules of the Superior Court, Judge Sloane carefully noted that further testimony and evidence was required, before the Court could properly consider the legal question of whether claimant was \u201con the premises\u201d of the employer at the time he fell, and Judge Sloane stated that the case was remanded to the Board for \u201cadditional testimony\u201d and \u201cfurther evidence.\u201d\nMoreover, the second subsection of \u00a7427 requires as a prerequisite to its application that the Court \u201creverse the action of the Board founded [on the Board\u2019s Findings of Fact] to which exception has been taken.\u201d Judge Sloane, in his order, clearly did not reverse the order of the Board and, therefore, the second subsection of \u00a7427 was inoperative.\nWe are of the opinion that, under Judge Sloane\u2019s 'remand order, the record was remitted for certain specific findings of fact, that the Board\u2019s power and competency to act were limited to finding such specific facts, and that the record was to be returned to the court where the appeal was still \u201cpending\u201d rather than \u25a0for a redetermination of the entire matter by taking a new appeal.\nOrder of the Superior Court quashing the appeal reversed and the matter remanded to the Superior Court for determination of the merits of the appeal.\nThe appeal was quashed because it was from an interlocutory nonappealable order.\nIf a new appeal was required, then exceptions to the Board\u2019s action should have been filed within thirty days of notice of the appeal before jurisdiction in the Common Pleas Court would attach.
