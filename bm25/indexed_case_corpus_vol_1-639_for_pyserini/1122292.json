{"id": "1122292", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe controlling question on this appeal goes to the proper construction of section 1 of the Act of March 31, 1915, P. L. 39, which directs \u201cthe prothonotary of each county......not to enter any judgment unless the judgment creditor, or his duly authorized attorney or agent, produces......a certificate signed by the judgment creditor, or his duly authorized attorney or agent, setting forth the precise residence address of the said creditor.\u201d\nHere, judgment by confession was entered against defendant on a note. Subsequently, a rule was allowed to show cause why the judgment should not be stricken off, because of alleged noncompliance with the above statutory provision. The court below discharged this rule, and defendant has appealed.\nIn the first place, appellant contends that the address of the judgment creditor is not precisely set forth in what appellee relies on as the certificate required by the Act of 1915. The certificate in question appears on the back of the note itself, and reads thus: \u201cHereby certify that the precise residence address of the judgment creditor Frankford Ave. & E. Hagert St. Phila. Filed Jan. 16, 1923. Gross Pro. Prothy.\u201d\nIn Deibert v. Rhodes, 291 Pa. 550, 553, we held the \u201csole object\u201d of the Act of 1915 \u201cwas to afford reliable record information to the tax authorities\u201d of the address of the judgment creditor. The address furnished in the present case is the business office and brewery of such creditor, which property occupies a large section of a city block. Under these circumstances, the information was sufficiently precise to comply with the \u201cmandatory\u201d requirements (Deibert v. Rhodes, supra, 554) of the statute. A numbered \u201cstreet address\u201d is \u201cnot essential\u201d in every case: New Amsterdam B. & L. Assn. v. Moyerman, 95 Pa. Superior Ct. 47, 52-3.\nAppellant next contends that the certification here relied on is not signed, and in that respect fails to comply with the requirements of the act; but the prothonotary\u2019s filing stamp is at the foot of the certificate, followed by the signature \u201cGross,\u201d in ink, which indicates that one of the prothonotary\u2019s deputies or clerks, by that name, acted in the premises, and, as pointed out in Deibert v. Rhodes, supra (at page 553), the prothonotary or his deputy may be the agent of the judgment creditor for the purpose of certifying the latter\u2019s address. The court below well says, \u201cWe must presume that what was done was done regularly\u201d; hence, as in the Deibert Case (page 553), we shall assume that, \u201cin recording the information plaintiff gave as to his residence, the prothonotary and his deputy were acting as agents for him in what he at least impliedly authorized them to do.\u201d On this theory, those requirements of the act regulating the manner of furnishing information as to the address of the judgment creditor, which, in the Deibert Case (page 554), we held to be \u201cmerely directory,\u201d were sufficiently met.\nThe order appealed from is affirmed."}
