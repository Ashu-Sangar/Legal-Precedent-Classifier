The reasons assigned in support of the issuance of the writ are devoid of merit. See, Commonwealth ex rel. Blackshear v. Myers, 419 Pa. 151, 213 A. 2d 378 (1965), and Commonwealth ex rel. Swiger v. Maroney, 420 Pa. 34, 215 A. 2d 636 (1966).\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Cohen took no part in the consideration or decision of this case."}
