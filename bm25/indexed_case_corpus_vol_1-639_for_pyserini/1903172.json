{"id": "1903172", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nW. C. Frisch (Frisch) instituted a trespass action in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County, on April 24, 1961, against five defendants, including Briggs & Stratton Corporation (Briggs), a Delaware corporation not registered to do business in Pennsylvania. This action was commenced by the issuance of a summons the personal service of which upon an alleged agent of Briggs at the agent\u2019s Philadelphia address failed. In the meantime, Frisch attempted to make a substituted service of Ms complaint upon Briggs, under the provisions of the Business Corporation Law of 1933, by sending a copy of the complaint by registered mail to the Secretary of the Commonwealth and to Briggs at its office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nBriggs, by preliminary objections, challenged the validity of the substituted service upon two grounds: (a) that it had not \u201cdone any business\u201d in Pennsylvania and (b) that Frisch\u2019s action did not arise \u201cout of acts or omissions of\u201d Briggs in Pennsylvania. Interrogatories, Briggs\u2019 answers thereto and Frisch\u2019s answer to Briggs\u2019 preliminary objections were duly filed. On the basis of the record before it \u2014 the complaint, the preliminary objections, the answers to interrogatories and the answers to the preliminary objections \u2014 the court below dismissed Briggs\u2019 preliminary objections \u201cwithout prejudice to the rights of [Briggs] to raise the question of jurisdiction at trial.\u201d From that order Briggs has appealed.\nThe present action was commenced on April 24, 1961; it is the statutory law in effect at that time which governs this case. See: Kilian v. Allegheny County Distributors, 409 Pa. 344, 350, 351, 185 A. 2d 517 (1962). Construing the statute in effect when this action was commenced, we said in Rufo v. The Bastion-Blessing Co., 405 Pa. 12, 14, 173 A. 2d 123 (1961) : \u201cSection 1011B clearly sets forth two jurisdictional requirements which must be satisfied before a non-registered foreign corporation may be validly served with process through the Secretary of the Commonwealth: (1) the corporation must have \u2018done business\u2019 in the Commonwealth [as defined in \u00a71, Act of November 10, 1959, P. L. 1406, 15 P.S. \u00a72852-1011 (Pkt. Pt.)] and (2) the action must arise out of \u2018acts or omissions\u2019 of the corporation within the Commonwealth.\u201d Both parties and the court below are in full accord with this construction of \u00a71011B; the divergence in their views lies in the application of \u00a71011B to the factual situation herein presented.\nHas Frisch, relying on substituted service to obtain in personam jurisdiction over Briggs, satisfied the dual requirements of \u00a71011B permitting such substituted service by demonstrating that Briggs has \u201cdone any business\u201d in Pennsylvania and that this trespass action arises \u201cout of acts or omissions of [Briggs]\u201d within Pennsylvania? Such is the purpose of our inquiry and, in pursuing such inquiry, we examine the findings of the court below to ascertain whether such findings find support in any evidence on this record. The court below found that Briggs had \u201cdone business\u201d in Pennsylvania and that this action arose out of Briggs\u2019 \u201cacts or omissions\u201d in Pennsylvania.\nResolution of the question whether Briggs had \u201cdone any business\u201d in Pennsylvania requires consideration of what the legislature meant by \u201cdoing business\u201d and whether, under the instant factual situation, Briggs\u2019 activities fall within the legislative intendment.\nSection 1011C of the statute (Act of November 10, 1959, P. L. 1406, \u00a71, 15 P.S. \u00a72852-10110 provides the entry of a corporation into Pennsylvania for (a) \u201cthe doing of a series of similar acts for the purpose of thereby realizing pecuniary benefit or otherwise accomplishing an object\u201d or (b) \u201cdoing a single act [in Pennsylvania] for such purpose, with the intention of thereby initiating a series of such acts\u201d, constitutes \u201cdoing business\u201d. By such yardstick we must evaluate that which Briggs did or did not do in determining whether the first jurisdictional requirement of \u00a71011B has been met.\nThe record reveals that: (1) Briggs, a Delaware corporation, is not registered to do business in Pennsylvania and has its office and place of business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin; (2) Briggs manufactures, distributes, services and supplies machinery and equipment, including engines for pumps; (3) Briggs\u2019 executives and other employees \u201cmay\u201d enter Pennsylvania \u201con an occasional or sporadic basis to visit customers and to review with [customers] areas of applicability for [Briggs\u2019] engines and to discuss other general problems\u201d; (4) it has two salaried employees, responsible for an area, including Pennsylvania, who enter Pennsylvania, \u201cto maintain liaison\u201d with and \u201cto review the functions of distributors and dealers\u201d who, in the capacity of independent contractors, service Briggs\u2019 products and for their own account buy and sell replacement parts and engines; (5) it has another salaried employee who generally performs like duties with respect to \u201coriginal equipment manufacturers who buy from [Briggs]\u201d; (6) such employees have no authority to accept orders for Briggs\u2019 products; (7) all orders originating in Pennsylvania for Briggs\u2019 products are accepted only by Briggs in Wisconsin and all deliveries are made f.o.b. points in Wisconsin; (8) Briggs had contracts with two concerns \u2014 one in Pittsburgh, the other in Philadelphia \u2014 to act as \u201ccentral service distributors\u201d, each buying and selling Briggs\u2019 products for its own account on orders accepted in Wisconsin calling for delivery f.o.b. points in Wisconsin and each distributor also develops sales and service outlets in Pennsylvania and adjacent states; (9) Briggs has no interest in any company nor does it have a subsidiary in Pennsylvania; (10) Briggs maintains no office or plant, has no telephone facility or bank account, nor does it purchase materials by purchase orders in Pennsylvania; (11) it does advertise in various media which appear in Pennsylvania. A review of this record convinces us that Briggs\u2019 activities are of such nature as to indicate it was \u201cdoing business\u201d within the import of \u00a7\u00a71011B and 1011C.\nSwavely v. Vandegrift, 397 Pa. 281, 154 A. 2d 779 (1959), Miller v. Kiamesha-Concord, Inc., 420 Pa. 604, 218 A. 2d 309 (1966), and Hilton v. W. T. Grant Co., 212 F. Supp. 126 \u2014 all relied on by Briggs \u2014 are factually inapposite. In our view, the factual situation more nearly approaches that in Rufo v. The Bastian-Blessing Co., 405 Pa. 12, 173 A. 2d 123 (1961). Through its salaried employees who made regular monthly visits in Pennsylvania, through the sporadic visits of its executives and other employees and through the close collaboration with its distributors and those dealing with its products, even though on an independent contract basis, Briggs was carrying on a \u201cseries of similar acts\u201d for pecuniary profit in Pennsylvania.\nIn deciding whether Frisch\u2019s action arises out of \u201cacts or omissions\u201d of Briggs in Pennsylvania, we accept as true, for the purpose of this inquiry, the well-pleaded facts in the complaint. Frisch avers that, on May 25, 1959, as a pump attendant and operating engineer, he was working on a sewer construction project in Boothwyn, Delaware County; while so employed, he was working near a pump which exploded causing him personal injuries; that Briggs had manufactured the engine which was attached to the pump which exploded; that this engine had been \u201csold, leased, consigned, bailed and/or delivered to\u201d either one or both of two named Philadelphia concerns which had, by either or both concerns, been \u201csold, leased, rented, bailed, consigned, supplied, serviced and/or delivered\u201d to the general contractor on the sewer project by whom Frisch was employed; that Briggs knew or should have known the likelihood of persons in Frisch\u2019s status being in the vicinity of the pump, that the pump was being used in a manner to be anticipated by Briggs and that the manner of injury could have been foreseen by Briggs. Specifically, Briggs was charged with negligence as follows: (1) of failure of care in making, testing and inspecting the engine; (2) failure to warn of latent defects; (3) failure to properly design engine; (4) failure to provide proper safety designs; (5) failure to continue to warn of latent defects; (6) failure to warn after engine was discovered to be defective; (7) failure to give adequate directions for use of engine; (8) failure to adhere to proper safety standards in the manufacture, inspection and testing of the engine; (9) that it made repairs without discovering defects; (10) failure to instruct on operation of engine; (11) failure to select proper materials to construct engine.\nDespite these averments of \u201cacts or omissions\u201d on Briggs\u2019 part, there is upon this record no averment that such \u201cacts or omissions\u201d took place in Pennsylvania. The record clearly shows that the engine was manufactured in Wisconsin and that the delivery of this product, as all other products of Briggs, was made f.o.b. some point in Wisconsin to either or both of two Pennsylvania business concerns. The court below stated: \u201cImpliedly, if not specifically, it would appear from the pleadings that [Frisch\u2019s] action arose from \u2018acts or omissions\u2019 of the corporation within the Commonwealth.\u201d The burden was upon Frisch, as a prerequisite to the use of the \u201clong arm\u201d provisions of \u00a71011B to secure in personam jurisdiction, to establish that the action which he instituted arose out of \u201cacts or omissions\u201d of Briggs within Pennsylvania; neither impliedly nor expressly has such been shown and Frisch has not sustained his burden. See: Rufo v. The Bastian-Blessing Co., supra, p. 23; Yentzer v. Taylor Wine Co., 409 Pa. 338, 340, 341, 186 A. 2d 396 (1962); Saccoccia v. Stough, 198 F. Supp. 169, 171 (W. D. Pa.) (1961); Kramer v. Lakeside Laboratories Co., 200 F. Supp. 530 (E. D. Pa.) (1962); Flaherty v. United Engineers and Constructors, Inc., 213 F. Supp. 835 (1961).\nWhile the instant record indicates that Briggs had been \u201cdoing business\u201d in Pennsylvania and that, thus, the first jurisdictional requirement upon which substituted service can be predicated has been met, yet the record does not show, either impliedly or expressly, that this action arose out of any \u201cacts or omissions\u201d committed in Pennsylvania. By reason of the failure to establish the second jurisdictional requirement, the substituted service of the complaint upon Briggs was ineffective and tlxe court below did not acquire jurisdiction over the person of Briggs.\nOrder reversed. Costs on Frisch.\nUpon the basis of a stipulation between counsel for Frisch and Briggs, the court below set aside this attempt at personal service.\nSection 1011B of the Act of May 5, 1933, P. L. 364, as amended, 15 P.S. \u00a72852-1011B.\nThe form of this order does not preclude this appeal under the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, \u00a71, 12 P.S. \u00a7672. This statute relates to the right of a plaintiff to have his cause of action heard and determined (Strank v. Mercy Hospital of Johnstown, 376 Pa. 305, 309, 102 A. 2d 170 (1954) ; Wilcox v. Evans, 190 Pa. Superior Ct. 166, 168, 153 A. 2d 817 (1959)). Where the jurisdiction of the court over the person is challenged, as in the case at bar, the statute provides a method for a determination of such jurisdiction at the appellate level before a trial of the cause on its merits. See: Hamie v. DiGirolamo, 412 Pa. 589, 593, 195 A. 2d 517 (1963). Particularly is this important in the case of a non-registered foreign corporation; otherwise, a serious constitutional problem might be presented since any attempt to obtain in personam jurisdiction over such a corporation must satisfy the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d doctrine enunciated in McGee v. International Life Insurance Co., 355 U.S. 220, 78 S. Ot. 199 (1957) and International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S. Ct. 154 (1945) so that \u201cmaintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u201d See: Hamilton Equipment, Inc. v. Onamia Corp., 411 Pa. 525, 529, 192 A. 2d 734 (1963).\nThe importance of this is evident in this case. On August 13, 1963, the legislature amended \u00a71011B and changed one of its two jurisdictional requirements by providing that substituted service on non-registered foreign corporations could be had \u201cin any action arising within this Commonwealth\u201d rather than \u201cin any action arising out of acts or omissions of such corporation within this Commonwealth.\u201d under the prior statutory provision. See: Act of August 13, 1963, P. L. 703, \u00a71, 15 P.S. \u00a72852-1011B (Pkt. Pt.)."}
