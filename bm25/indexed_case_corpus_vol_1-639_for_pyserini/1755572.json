{"id": "1755572", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nOn July 9,1974, the City of Pittsburgh filed a complaint in equity in Commonwealth Court. The City sought to enjoin the Pennsylvania Bureau of Corrections\u2019 use, without a zoning permit, of 535 South Aiken Avenue as a pre-release center for female convicts. 535 South Aiken Avenue was zoned \u201cresidential.\u201d Commonwealth Court held that the Bureau, as an agent of the Commonwealth, was not required to comply with municipal zoning ordinances and regulations and dismissed the complaint. On appeal, this Court held that in exercising the power to zone, municipalities are agents of the Commonwealth, just as is the Bureau of Corrections. We further concluded that where there is an apparent conflict in the use of powers conferred upon Commonwealth agents by the Legislature, \u201cwe must look to the intent o\u00a5 the Legislature to determine which exercise of authority is to prevail.\u201d 468 Pa. 174, 182, 360 A.2d 607, 612 (1976). We noted also that, \u201cThe Legislature has explicitly directed that whenever zoning regulations impose higher standards \u2018than are required in any other statute\u2019 the zoning regulations \u2018shall govern.\u2019 \u201d 468 Pa. at 185, 360 A.2d at 613. Thus, this Court held that the Bureau was not immune to Pittsburgh\u2019s zoning ordinances and regulations and reversed the decree of the Commonwealth Court. 468 Pa. 174, 360 A.2d 607 (1976).\nAppellee City of Pittsburgh then amended its complaint to allege that three other properties were being used and occupied by the Bureau as pre-release centers in violation of local zoning regulations. Commonwealth Court found the Bureau had unqualifiedly admitted this allegation and held that any facts in dispute were relevant only to defenses not available to the Bureau. Commonwealth Court, en banc, therefore, granted summary judgment in favor of the City. On this appeal, the Bureau argues that Commonwealth Court erred in refusing to entertain its defense that the zoning ordinance is unconstitutionally vague, arbitrary and exclusionary.\nIt is established that, \u201cthe statutory remedy prescribed by the Legislature is the exclusive remedy to be pursued by one \u2018aggrieved\u2019 by a zoning ordinance . . .\u201d Pittsburgh Outdoor Advertising v. Clairton, 390 Pa. 1, 9, 133 A.2d 542, 546 (1957). See also Honey Brook Township v. Alenovitz, 430 Pa. 614, 243 A.2d 330 (1968); Pittsburgh v. Oakhouse Associates, 8 Pa.Cmwlth. 349, 301 A.2d 387 (1973). The Bureau concedes that Section 7 of the Act of 1927, 53 P.S. \u00a7 25057 creates the standard procedure by which to challenge the constitutionality or lawfulness of local zoning ordinances and regulations. The Bureau argues, however, that it has no statutory remedy and, thus, no adequate remedy at law because the court of common pleas has stayed, pending the outcome of this litigation, the Bureau\u2019s appeal of a denial of a zoning permit with respect to one of the properties in this dispute. In this exceptional circumstance, the Bureau contends, equity must consider the constitutionality of the ordinance it is enforcing.\nBut this argument is self-defeating. The very fact that there is a legal proceeding pending at which the constitutional claim may be litigated undermines any claim that there is no statutory remedy. Thus we conclude that Commonwealth Court was correct when it ruled that equity has no jurisdiction in this case to determine the merits of the Commonwealth\u2019s legal defenses.\nThe Bureau argues, in addition, that summary judgment was inappropriate because certain affidavits raise a dispute concerning material facts. See Pa.R.C.P. 1035(b). The Affidavit of William J. Cammarata avers, for example, that the Thomas Avenue property is not used \u201cas an institution,\u201d and that it is in compliance with the City\u2019s zoning ordinance. Commonwealth Court correctly found, however, that the only disputed issues of fact concerned legal issues \u201cproperly raised only through the applicable zoning procedures and judicial review thereof.\u201d 32 Pa.Cmwlth. 596, 598, 379 A.2d 1388, 1389. Since Commonwealth Court properly decided that it did not have jurisdiction to hear these claims, its decision that disputes about these facts are not material is also correct.\nDecree of the Commonwealth Court affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nEAGEN, C. J., filed a dissenting opinion in which NIX, J., joined.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. The other properties were: (1) 7228 Thomas Boulevard, (2) 915 Ridge Avenue and (3) 501 North Negley Avenue. The City later withdrew its complaint with respect to the Ridge Avenue property when it discovered that the requisite permits had been issued to the Bureau.\n. We hear this appeal pursuant to Section 723(a) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 723(a).\n. Pertinent portions of the comprehensive statute creating the board of adjustment and granting a right of appeal from any of its decisions follow:\n\u201cThe mayor of every city of the second class shall, with the approval of the council, appoint a board of adjustment and in the regulations and restrictions adopted pursuant to the authority of this act, it shall be provided that the said board of adjustments may, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, make special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance, in harmony with its general purpose and intent and in accordance with general or specific rules therein contained.\n* * \u2021 * * *\nAppeals to the board of adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved, or by the head of any department affected by or interested in any decision of the officer charged with the administration of the ordinance. Such appeal shall be taken within a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the board, by filing with the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the board of adjustment a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the board all the papers constituting the record upon which thq action appealed from was taken.\nAn appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the board of adjustment, after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would in his opinion cause imminent peril to life or property.\n\u2021 ^ \u2018 \u2666 \u2021 \u2021 \u2021\nAny person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment, or any property owner, or the head of any department interested therein,' may present to the court of common pleas of the county wherein said city may be located, a petition duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal in whole or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality.\u201d\nThe Bureau does not argue that the injunction sought against it was \u201cin furtherance of the action appealed from.\u201d\n. The Bureau does not claim either that it requested the Commonwealth Court to stay its proceedings pending the outcome of its appeal from the board of adjustment\u2019s denial of permits for the Thomas Avenue property or that there was any bar to earlier recourse to the board.\n. We need not, therefore, reach appellants\u2019 claim that equitable jurisdiction would lie if the relief mandated by Section 25057 were not available."}
