{"id": "925577", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe testimony required a submission of the case to the jury. It tended to show that the ridge of ice had existed on the sidewalk for sufficient time to imply notice to the city, even if there was not notice in fact. The plaintiff was entitled to traverse the sidewalk, using proper care in so doing, and whether he had used such care was also for the jury. We therefore dismiss the specifications of error.\nJudgment affirmed."}
