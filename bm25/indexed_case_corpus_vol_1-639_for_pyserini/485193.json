{"id": "485193", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nJONES, Chief Justice.\nAppellant alleges a cause of action in libel. After suit was filed but before trial, the defendant, Dr. Phillips, died. The trial court entered an order dismissing any further proceedings on the basis that the cause of action died with the defendant. The Superior Court affirmed per curiam. We granted allocatur in order to consider the constitutional issues raised.\nThe complaint alleges that Mr. Moyer, a tractor-trailer driver for over thirty-five years, went to Dr. Phillips for a physical examination as required by ICC regulations. As a consequence of the examination, Dr. Phillips wrote to Mr. Moyer\u2019s employer, Hall\u2019s Motor Transit Company, that he considered Mr. Moyer a chronic alcoholic; and that although Mr. Moyer could return to work, he ought not be allowed to drive a truck. Mr. Moyer had been employed with Hall\u2019s for about seven years during which he attained a perfect driving record. He alleges that as a result of Dr. Phillips\u2019 continuing libel, he has suffered and continues to suffer damage in the nature of deprivation of his professional status, employment, company and union benefits, retirement, health, welfare and life insurance benefits and good name.\nThe trial court dismissed appellant\u2019s cause of action pursuant to Section 3371 of the Probate, Estates, and Fiduciaries Act of 1972, No. 164, as amended, 20 P.S. \u00a7 3371, which provides:\n\u201cAll causes of action or proceedings, real or personal, except actions for slander or libel, shall survive the death of the plaintiff or of the defendant, or the death of one or more joint plaintiffs or defendants.\u201d\nAppellant argues that the exception of libel from this section today is an arbitrary denial of equal protection and a denial of his access to the courts for injury suffered. We agree.\nSir Frederick Pollock in his work on Torts (12th Edition) pp. 60-62, discussed the effect of the death of a party on common law liability, calling it one of the \u201cleast rational parts\u201d of our law. The rule's origin is obscure and post-classical. At one time the rule may have been justified by the vindicative and quasi-criminal character of suits for civil injuries since a process which is felt to be a substitute for private war may seem incapable of being continued on behalf of or against a dead man\u2019s estate, an impersonal abstraction. But \u201conce the notion of vengeance has been put aside and that of compensation substituted, the rule actio personalis moritur cum persona seems to be without plausible ground.\u201d Id. at 62. Prosser similarly states:\n\u201cThe best conjecture on the subject is that it was a result of the development of the tort remedy as an adjunct and incident to criminal punishment in the old appeal of felony and the act of trespass which succeeded it. Since the defendant could not be punished when he was dead, it was natural to regard his demise as terminating the criminal action, and tort liability with it. If it was the plaintiff who died, the early cases usually were those of homicide, for which the Crown executed the defendant and confiscated all his property, so that nothing was left for tort compensation; and if not homicide, it was still to be expected that lesser crimes should be redressed by the Crown rather than successors of the deceased.\u201d\nProsser, Law of Torts (4th Edition, 1971), at 898.\nIn the early nineteenth century survival statutes were enacted, along with wrongful death acts, to modify what was considered the harsh and unjust rule of common law. The history of their development in Pennsylvania is one of gradual expansion by the legislature limited by some narrow interpretation by the courts. See Miller v. Wilson, 24 Pa. 114 (1854); Maher v. Philadelphia Traction Co., 181 Pa. 391, 37 A. 571 (1897); Boyd v. Snyder, 207 Pa. 330, 56 A. 924 (1904); Sunanday v. McKentley, 244 Pa. 533, 90 A. 799 (1914), and compare with Rodebaugh v. Philadelphia Traction Co., 190 Pa. 358, 42 A. 953 (1899). In Sunanday and Boyd the Court read the survival statute as having no application to suits involving less tangible interests in personalty such as malicious prosecution and criminal conversation. As a result, the legislature restated the survival provisions in the Act of 1917 so as to clearly state that all causes of action except libel and slander survived the death of either party. Presumably, libel and slander were excepted because at the time, they were still considered as adjunct and incident to criminal punishment. The criminal libel statute has since been repealed by the Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 5,18 C.P.S.A.\nAll causes of action survive the death of either party today except those alleging injury to reputation. Anderson v. G. A. C. Consumer Discount Co., 53 Pa.D. & C.2d 464 (C.P.Lack., 1971); Smith v. Brown, 17 Pa.D. & C. 548 (C.P.Monroe, 1933); cf. Menefee v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 458 Pa. 46, 329 A.2d 216 (1974). However, protection of one\u2019s reputation is a fundamental right classified with life, liberty and property. Article I, Declaration of Rights, Pennsylvania Constitution, Sections 1, 11. It is a right to be protected. regardless of allegation of special or economic damage. Meas v. Johnson, 185 Pa. 12, 39 A. 562 (1898). See also Note, Some Aspects of Civil Libel in Pennsylvania, 7 Temple L.Q. 483 (1933).\nAlthough survival statutes have existed for some time, we have not been asked heretofore to examine the constitutionality of any of the various statutes. Appellant urges that the exception of libel and slander is a denial of equal protection of the law under the state and federal constitutions. The standard to be applied in this case is set forth in Cavill Estate, 459 Pa. 411, 416, 329 A.2d 503, 505 (1974). See also Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 447, 92 S.Ct. 1029, 31 L.Ed.2d 349 (1972); Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 76, 92 S.Ct. 251, 30 L.Ed.2d 225 (1971); Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U.S. 412, 415, 40 S. Ct. 560, 64 L.Ed. 989 (1920).\nThe Equal Protection' Clause of both constitutions does not deny the State the power to treat different classes of persons in different ways, but does deny the right to legislate that different treatment be accorded to persons placed by a statute into different classes on the basis of criteria wholly unrelated to the objective of the particular statute. The classification must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\nThe survival statute divides injured parties into two classes. The first class is composed of all parties who suffer legal injuries other than those to reputation. The second class is composed of those persons who suffer legal injury to reputation. The survival statute assures that all members of the first class will not have an accrued cause of action extinguished by the death of a party, while for the second class, extinguishment in similar circumstances is mandated.\nThe purpose of the survival statute is remedial and the statute is broadly drawn. Centovani v. Penna. R. R., 244 Pa. 255, 263, 90 A. 558, 561 (1914). Cf. Johnson v. People\u2019s First Nat. Bk. and Tr. Co., 394 Pa. 116, 124, 145 A.2d 716, 719-720 (1958). The broadness of the statute comprehends the modern theory of torts which is generally compensatory in nature. See Pollock, supra; 1 Sedgwick, Damages (9th Edition, 1912), \u00a7\u00a7 29, 30. Another purpose of the statute is compensation of the victim\u2019s creditors. Burns v. Goldberg, 210 F.2d 646, 650 (3d Cir. 1954).\nThe Second Restatement (Tentative Draft No. 21, 1975) states that the tort law of libel and slander serves three separate functions: compensation of the plaintiff for the injury to reputation, for pecuniary loss and for emotional distress; vindication and restoration of his reputation; and punishment of defendant in order to dissuade him and others from publishing defamatory statements. We have stated that vindication and restoration of the victim\u2019s reputation is the most important function of the cause of action. Gaetano v. Sharon Herald Co., 426 Pa. 179, 183, 231 A.2d 753, 755 (1967).\nToday a defamation action as any other tort action is punitive only in the sense that it serves the social objective of regulating the conduct of defendant while alive and the conduct of others. Its purpose above all is compensation for and restoration of the victim\u2019s good name. It can no longer be said that the tort of libel or slander is adjunct to the crime of libel, the legislature having repealed the criminal libel law subsequent to. the re-enactment of the 1972 Probate Code. Furthermore, it has been determined that exemplary damages, which are clearly punitive, are consistent with the policies of the statute and do survive. Hennigan v. Atlantic Refining Co., D.C., 282 F.Supp. 667, 683, aff'd, 400 F.2d 857 (3d Cir. 1967), cert. den., 395 U.S. 904, 89 S.Ct. 1739, 23 L. Ed.2d 216 (1969).\nThe preclusion of the victim\u2019s estate or, as in the instant case, the victim himself from ever vindicating and restoring his good name does not further the statute\u2019s remedial purpose nor does it serve the essential compensatory purpose of the statute where the plaintiff suffered and continues to suff\u00e9r substantial and real damages. As for allowing a tortfeasor\u2019s estate to escape liability for tortious conduct, it not only deprives the plaintiff of compensation but also his creditors who must bear the burden of the deceased tortfeasor\u2019s acts. For example, the plaintiff here has been placed on state welfare by his loss of employment and has been placed in arrears with his creditors.\nIn a word, as the court of a sister state recently has said, any distinction, for purposes of survival, which differentiates libel and slander from other actions is arbitrary. No function of the survival statute or of the law of defamation is served by the statute\u2019s exception. Diligent search reveals no other policy or purpose in any way furthered by the exception. While the classification may have borne at least some relation to a legislative purpose in earlier times, any such rationale no longer exists to validate the rule. Cf. Niederman v. Brodsky, 436 Pa. 401, 413, 261 A.2d 84, 89-90 (1970). As it exists today, the exception is arbitrary and bears no relationship to' the objective of the statute. Accordingly, it cannot stand.\nOrder vacated and case remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which NIX, J., joined.\nPOMEROY, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. The Attorney General, who was notified pursuant to Rule 235 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, 12 P.S.Appendix, did not wish to intervene.\n. Appellant was permitted in this court to proceed in forma pauperis pursuant to Supreme Court Rule 61.\n. In view of our disposition of this case on equal protection grounds, we do not address the issue of due process. However, the two state courts which-have previously addressed the constitutionality of exceptions to survival have both upheld survivability on state due process grounds. See Wilfong v. Omaha and Council Bluffs St. Ry. Co., 129 Neb. 600, 262 N.W. 537 (1935); Waller v. First Savings and Trust Co., 103 Fla. 1025, 138 So. 780 (1931), reh\u2019g den., 1932.\n. Act of June 7, 1917, P.L. 447, \u00a7 35(a) replaced by the Act of April 18, 1949, P.L. 512, \u00a7 601.\n. Libel was criminal in origin and remained a common law crime. Slander, which tended to become fused with libel, was never a crime but could only become so when the words amounted to some other offense such as blasphemy or a breach of the peace. Prosser at 751.\n. In Menefee, recently decided, we were not requested nor required to address any contitutional challenge to the exception within the statute.\n. In Lattimore v. Simmons, 13 Serg. & R. 183 (1825), it was said that damages in a breach of contract of marriage involved injury to feelings and thus were \u201cvindictive and uncertain.\u201d The Court held that at least in the absence of special damages, they ought not survive, implying that injury to intangible interests in personalty were in a sense a windfall. The legislature in 1917 made it explicit that injuries to intangible interests were just as survivable as purely physical injuries; the provisions were restated to assure such actions as criminal conversation and malicious prosecution survive. This Court has held that an action for consortium survives. Smith v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., 232 Pa. 456, 81 A. 554 (1911). Alienation of affections survives, Smith v. Brown, 17 Pa.D. & C. 548 (1832), as does an action for pain and suffering and mental anguish. Incollingo v. Ewing, 444 Pa. 263, 296, 282 A.2d 206, 224 (1971).\n. In construing its state survival statute, the New Jersey Court said:\n\u201cThe term \u2018trespass\u2019 in the statute is equated with \u2018tort.\u2019 It should not be modified by implication to exclude torts in which damages for emotional distress, not physical injury, are sought. Any such distinction is arbitrary. Damages for mental suffering and nervous anguish without physical injury were recoverable at common law in several causes of action arising out of trespass on the case, e. g., libel, slander, malicious prosecution and alienation of affections. Nor is there any logical basis for Justice Parker\u2019s dictum in Alpaugh [Alpaugh v. Conkling, 88 N.J.L. 64, 95 A. 618] that defamation actions alleging special damages, that is, property or money losses, are within the survival statute, although defamation actions alleging general damages are not.\u201d\nWeller v. Home News Pub. Co., 112 N.J.Super. 502, 518, 271 A.2d 738, 740 (1970).\n. Prosser, in presenting two additional arguments advanced against the desirability of broad survival statutes generally, quickly disposes of them:\n\u201cThere has been some dispute as to the desirability of broad survival statutes. Opposition to them is based upon the argument that justice does not require a windfall to the plaintiff\u2019s heirs by way of compensation for an injury to them when they have suffered none of their own, together with the contention that since one party is dead and the other necessarily not disinterested, the truth will be difficult to ascertain in court. The answer to the latter objection is that no serious difficulties have arisen as to contract actions and those torts which now survive. As to the first, the modern trend is definitely toward the view that tort causes of action and liabilities are as fairly part of the estate of either plaintiff or defendant as contract debts, and that the question is rather one of why a fortuitous event such as death should extinguish a valid action.\u201d\nId. at 901.\nIt can be noted that not only do libel and slander present no particular problems in ascertaining the truth but also the fact that a third party must always testify in order to establish publication. The \u201cwindfall\u201d argument has no application at all where the plaintiff, as in the instant case, is alive. See note 7, supra.\n. The libel and slander exception to the statute is severable. Act of November 25, 1970, P.L. 707, No. 230, added 1972 December 6, No. 290, \u00a7 3."}
