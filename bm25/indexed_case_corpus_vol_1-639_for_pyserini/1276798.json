{"id": "1276798", "contents": "OPINION\nCAPPY, Justice.\nSection 1408(c)(4)(A)-(C) of the federal Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1408-1412 (the \u201cAct\u201d), authorizes a state court to dispose of military retirement pay according to state law in a divorce proceeding, provided the court has jurisdiction over the military member. Under the Act, jurisdiction may be premised on the member\u2019s consent. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C). The question presented in this appeal is whether the Appellant, Michael F. Wagner, consented to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. For all the reasons that follow, we hold that he did not. Accordingly, the order of the Superior Court, reversing the trial court\u2019s order granting Appellant\u2019s preliminary objections to jurisdiction, is reversed.\nAppellant and the Appellee, Amy L. Wagner, were married in Butler County, Pennsylvania on August 14, 1982. The Wagners had one child. Throughout the marriage, appellant was on active duty as an officer in the United States Air Force. The Wagners separated in 1992. Appellee returned to and now lives in Butler County. Appellant is presently stationed in New Mexico, and resides in Alaska.\nOn or about December 30, 1993, Appellee filed a Complaint for Support in the Court of Common Pleas of Butler County. Later, on June 24, 1994, she filed a Complaint in Divorce. Personal service of the reinstated Complaint in Divorce was effected on Appellant in Alabama on September 28, 1995. Appellant did not file an answer to the Complaint in Divorce. Appellee served Appellant with written interrogatories relating to income and expenses. Appellant did not answer Appellee\u2019s interrogatories. On February 16, 1996, Attorney Lee A. Montgomery filed a Praecipe for Appearance on Appellant\u2019s behalf in the divorce action. Thereafter, Appellant\u2019s attorney attended a hearing held by the trial court to decide whether Appellant should be held in contempt for failing to respond to Appellee\u2019s discovery. Eventually, Appellant produced credit card statements and answered Appellee\u2019s interrogatories. Appellant attended a support modification conference in connection with the separate proceeding commenced by Appellee\u2019s Complaint for Support.\nIn January 1998, Appellee filed an inventory, which listed Appellant\u2019s \u201cUnited States Air Force Retirement\u201d as marital property. Appellant did not file an inventory. On February 11, 1998, Appellee filed a Petition for Special Relief and for Bifurcation, requesting a schedule for pre-trial discovery, bifurcation, and a trial of economic issues. The trial court scheduled a bifurcation hearing for May 8, 1998. Appellant filed a Motion for Stay and/or Continuance and Preliminary Objections to Pennsylvania Jurisdiction on May 4, 1998. On May 7, 1998, Appellant filed a Refusal to Accept Jurisdiction of Court to Determine the Disposable Retirement Pay of A Member of the Armed Forces.\nAppellant\u2019s preliminary objections were premised on the Act, which provides that unless a court has jurisdiction over the military member by virtue of his residence, domicile or consent to the court\u2019s jurisdiction, it may not distribute the member\u2019s retirement pay. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(e)(4)(A)-(C). Appellant alleged that he did not reside and was not domiciled in Pennsylvania. He also averred that he did not consent to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction for purposes of the Act and objected to the court\u2019s jurisdiction over his retirement pay.\nThe trial court sustained Appellant\u2019s preliminary objections. The court first found that \u00a7 1408(c)(4) addresses subject matter jurisdiction. Since the parties conceded that Appellant was neither a resident nor a domiciliary of the Commonwealth, the court turned to the question of Appellant\u2019s consent. Based on its conclusion that the statute speaks to subject matter jurisdiction, the court reviewed the record to determine whether Appellant had consented to its jurisdiction over the retirement pay itself. The court found that no action Appellant had taken in the case amounted to such consent. Accordingly, the court held that it did not have jurisdiction under the Act to decide the equitable distribution of Appellant\u2019s retirement pay, and granted Appellant\u2019s preliminary objections by order dated May 14,1998.\nAt Appellee\u2019s request, the trial court issued an amended interlocutory order on. May 29, 1998. Appellee then filed a petition for permission to appeal under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702 in Superior Court, which was granted.\nThe Superior Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order. Wagner v. Wagner, 731 A.2d 632 (Pa.Super.1999). Like the trial court, the first question the Superior Court determined was whether \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C)\u2019s consent provision implicates subject matter or personal jurisdiction. In the Superior Court\u2019s view, since the residency and domicile alternatives in \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(A) and \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(B) respectively are traditional tests of personal jurisdiction, and because the legislative history of the Act shows that Congress sought to curtail a spouse\u2019s forum shopping, it was logical to conclude that the consent alternative in \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) is a matter of personal jurisdiction. Id. at 636-37.\nThe court then rejected Appellee\u2019s argument that Appellant\u2019s preliminary objections to jurisdiction were untimely, concluding that the question of consent for purposes of the Act is not whether the military member waived his right to object to personal jurisdiction under state procedural rules, but whether he engaged in some form of affirmative conduct that showed his express or implied consent to the trial court\u2019s general in personam jurisdiction. Id. at 637. Noting that Appellant accepted service of the Complaint in Divorce, secured counsel who entered a written appearance on his behalf, was represented by counsel at a discovery dispute hearing, complied with a discovery order, answered interrogatories, and attended an ancillary support modification conference in Butler County, the court held that Appellant had consented to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction through his participation in the divorce proceedings. Id. at 637-38. The court suggested that if Appellant had avoided process, immediately filed preliminary objections to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction or refused to participate in the action altogether, he would have succeeded in withholding his consent. Id. at 638.\nFinally, because its holding meant that all issues between the parties would be determined at once and in one forum, the court believed that the result it reached comported with public policy and principles of judicial economy. Id.\nWe begin our analysis with a brief background of the federal statute that we are called upon to construe in this case. Congress first enacted comprehensive nondisability military retirement legislation during the Civil War, with the aim of securing a youthful military force, providing for retired members, and encouraging service. In 1981, in McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U.S. 210, 101 S.Ct. 2728, 69 L.Ed.2d 589 (1981), the United States Supreme Court concluded that the application of California\u2019s community property to military retirement benefits conflicted with this legislation, and threatened the attainment of these goals. Id. at 232-35, 101 S.Ct. 2728. Based on its examination of federal law dealing with military benefits, the Court found that Congress intended retirement pay to be a military member\u2019s personal entitlement, not subject to division between him and his spouse. Id. at 224, 232, 101 S.Ct. 2728. The Court further found that application of state community property law to the pension would make it less valuable, and in turn, render military service less attractive. Id. at 234,101 S.Ct. 2728. Consequently, the Court held that federal law prohibits a state court from dividing a service-person\u2019s retirement pay pursuant to state community property statutes upon the dissolution of a marriage. Id. at 232-35,101 S.Ct. 2728. In closing, however, the Court observed that the plight of ex-spouses of retired military members is often a serious one and invited Congress to consider whether they should be afforded more protection. Id. at 235-36, 101 S.Ct. 2728.\nCongress responded to McCarty with the Act. The statute gives state courts the express authority to distribute military retirement pay in a domestic relations action, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(c)(1), and includes a mechanism by which a court order fixing the amount to which the spouse or former spouse of a military member is entitled can be served upon and satisfied directly by the federal government. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1408(a)(2), (d). Under \u00a7 1408(c)(4), however, the court\u2019s authority to distribute military retirement pay depends on its having \u201cjurisdiction over the member\u201d, which may be acquired in three alternative ways. Section 1408(c)(1) and \u00a7 1408(c)(4) state:\n\u00a7 1408. Payment of retired or retainer pay in compliance with court orders\n* Hi Hi\n(c) Authority for court to treat retired pay as property of the member and spouse. \u2014 (1) Subject to the limitations of this section, a court may treat the disposable retired pay payable to a member for pay periods beginning after June 25, 1981, either as property solely of the member or as property of the member and his spouse in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction of such court....\n(4) A court may not treat the disposable retired pay of a member in the manner described in paragraph (1) unless the court has jurisdiction over the member by reason of (A) his residence, other than because of military assignment, in the territorial jurisdiction of the court, (B) his domicile in the territorial jurisdiction of the court, or (C) his consent to the jurisdiction of the court.\n10 U.S.C. 1408(c)(1), (4) (emphasis added).\nAs a preliminary matter, we observe that under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s holding in McCarty and because the Act is federal legislation, federal principles, rather than Pennsylvania law, control the statute\u2019s construction. As in any statutory construction case, our goal is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of Congress. Negonsott v. Samuels, 507 U.S. 99, 104, 113 S.Ct. 1119, 122 L.Ed.2d 457 (1993). This process begins with the language of the statute. Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980). In ascertaining the meaning of a particular statutory provision, we \u201clook not only to the particular statutory language, but to the design of the statute as a whole and to its object and policy.\u201d Crandon v. United States, 494 U.S. 152, 158, 110 S.Ct. 997, 108 L.Ed.2d 132 (1990) (citations omitted). We are instructed that \u201c[a] few words of general connotation appearing in the text of statutes should not be given a wide meaning, contrary to a settled policy, excepting as a different purpose is plainly shown.\u201d United States v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 310 U.S. 534, 544, 60 S.Ct. 1059, 84 L.Ed. 1345 (1940) (citations omitted). We may presume that Congress is aware of the law, Goodyear Atomic Corp. v. Miller, 486 U.S. 174, 185-86, 108 S.Ct. 1704, 100 L.Ed.2d 158 (1988), and did not intend a result that is unjust, absurd or unreasonable. Webster v. Reproductive Health Servs., 492 U.S. 490, 515, 109 S.Ct. 3040, 106 L.Ed.2d 410 (1989).\nOur starting point in construing \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) is the issue that was central to the lower courts\u2019 respective decisions-does the statute speak to subject matter jurisdiction, as the trial court held, or does it address in personam jurisdiction, as the Superior Court determined. Because a court must have subject matter, as well as personal, jurisdiction to adjudicate a military member\u2019s rights to his pension and issue orders that bind him, see Insurance Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinea, 456 U.S. 694, 701, 102 S.Ct. 2099, 72 L.Ed.2d 492 (1982), Congress covered both in the Act. In 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(a)(1)(A), Congress allows \u201ccourts of competent jurisdiction\u201d to partition retirement pay \u201cin accordance with the law of the jurisdiction of such court\u201d. 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1408(c)(1). That is to say, the Act authorizes action by those state courts that already have subject matter jurisdiction and substantive law authority under pertinent state law. Thus, Congress did not grant subject matter jurisdiction to any court over a military pension in \u00a7 1408(c)(4), or elsewhere in the Act. Steel v. United States, 813 F.2d 1545, 1548 (9th Cir.l987)(\u201c[The Act] does not create jurisdiction, but grants power to courts once they have jurisdiction\u201d); Brown v. Harms, 863 F.Supp. 278, 280-81 (E.D.Va.1994). It necessarily follows and we conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 1408(c)(4) refers to personal jurisdiction. For this, however, Congress chose not to use state law. Instead, it usurped state long-arm statutes and provided in \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(A)-(C) its own tests of personal jurisdiction that all state courts must apply.\nOur next inquiry lies at the heart of this case-to what does \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) require consent. Once the Superior Court characterized \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) as a personal jurisdiction provision, it assumed that the statute meant consent to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction in a divorce proceeding for all purposes. The court did not allow for the possibility that \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) is more limited, and refers to a military serviceperson\u2019s consent to the court\u2019s authority over him to distribute his pension. It is this possibility that we now address.\nIn order to determine Congress\u2019 intent in this regard, it is helpful to remember that Congress views domestic relations as virtually the exclusive province of the states, and as an area in which it is reluctant to intrude. Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 404, 95 S.Ct. 553, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975). It is also important to remember that the authority granted to state courts in the family law context in which \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) operates is comprehensive. In divorce actions, state courts are empowered to decide a variety of matters; they dissolve marriages, resolve property rights, and determine issues of child custody, alimony and support. See, e.g., 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3104(a)(l)-(5). Many state courts, including those in Pennsylvania, have the power to determine property rights, even after a marriage has been dissolved in another forum. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3104(d); Cheng v. Cheng, 347 Pa.Super. 515, 500 A.2d 1175 (1985).\nLikewise, in this area, the rules that apply to the courts\u2019 authority over a person, including a military member, to render valid judgments are far-reaching. In Pennsylvania and elsewhere in the nation, courts may issue a divorce decree ex parte, as long as the plaintiff satisfies a residency requirement and serves the complaint. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3104(b); Pa. R.C.P.1920.4; see Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287, 297-99, 63 S.Ct. 207, 87 L.Ed. 279 (1942). Typically, where a defendant is subject to a state\u2019s long-arm statute and has sufficient contacts with that state, his rights in the matters ancillary to divorce may be determined by its courts. See Kulko v. California, 436 U.S. 84, 91-92, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 56 L.Ed.2d 132 (1978). Very often, once a court obtains personal jurisdiction over a defendant in the initial divorce action, it is empowered to bind him by subsequent orders over connected matters, including the partition of marital assets. See, e.g., White v. White, 543 So.2d 126,128 (La.App.1989).\nBy contrast and in keeping with the federal policy to keep federal intrusion into the area of domestic relations at a minimum, the Act controls the authority that state family law courts have over a single item, military retirement pay. The Act represents \u201cone of those rare instances where Congress has directly and specifically legislated in the area of domestic relations\u201d, Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U.S. 581, 587, 109 S.Ct. 2023, 104 L.Ed.2d 675 (1989), for the limited purpose of overriding the preemptive effect of federal law on the disposition in divorce actions of military pensions. In the Act, Congress did not purport to regulate any other of the several issues that may arise in a military member\u2019s divorce nor did it purport to speak to a member\u2019s conduct in litigation with regard to any issue but the retirement pay. Section 1408(c)(4) preempts state long-arm statutes only in connection with a court\u2019s authority to determine a military member\u2019s retirement pay, and leaves all other rules by which state courts acquire personal jurisdiction over a military member for divorce and ancillary economic issues untouched. By its terms, \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) reflects Congress\u2019 narrow aim. While the reference to jurisdiction in \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) is unqualified, \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) contains a reference to \u00a7 1408(c)(l)\u2019s specific focus on the retirement pay. Reading the language of \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) in context and consistently with the Act\u2019s scope and object, we believe that Congress intended for the consent requirement in \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) to relate, like the rest of the Act, specifically to a military member\u2019s pension.\nIndeed, to determine otherwise, as did the Superior Court, would run counter to Congress\u2019 purpose. The right to consent in \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) carries with it, of course, the right not to consent. Under the Superior Court\u2019s construction of the statute, a military member who seeks \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C)\u2019s protection should withhold his consent to the trial court\u2019s personal jurisdiction in general. Taken to its logical conclusion, however, the Superior Court\u2019s construction would mean that Congress gave a military member, who succeeds in withholding his consent under the statute, the power to veto the personal jurisdiction a court might otherwise have to dissolve a marriage or to determine the various matters, including the partition of other marital assets, that divorce actions raise. Given the federal principle that family law is preeminently a local matter and the limited focus of the Act, this simply cannot be the case.\nFurther, the Superior Court\u2019s construction is unworkable. In its opinion, the Superior Court suggested that a military member who does not consent under \u00a7 1408(c) to the trial court\u2019s authority to distribute his retirement pay should file preliminary objections to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction. Typically, however, he will be subject to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction, no matter what he files or states. Thus, a general assertion that withholds consent to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction would be legally meaningless on its face. In this context then, the assertion that has legal meaning is one (like the assertion made by Appellant) that withholds consent specifically to the court\u2019s jurisdiction -with respect to the retirement pay.\nFinally, the alternative suggestions the Superior Court gave to a military member to insure against a finding of consent under the statute \u2014 refuse service or make no appearance \u2014 are ill-advised. They encourage a military member to flout process and force upon him an unreasonable choice between participating in and remaining absent from important judicial proceedings.\nThus, we conclude that under \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C), the Pennsylvania courts may not exercise the authority they are provided in the Act to distribute a military member\u2019s retirement pay in a divorce action, unless the member consents to the court\u2019s jurisdiction over his person specifically to distribute the retirement pay.\nNext, we turn to the issue of waiver. Appellee urges us, as she did the Superior Court, to find that Appellant waived his right to object to the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction by filing preliminary objections on May 4, 1998, and not in 1995, when served with the Complaint in Divorce. The Superior Court rejected this argument, of the view that waiver is inapplicable in \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) cases. While we agree with the Superior Court\u2019s result, we do not paint with as broad a brush.\nThe requirement of personal jurisdiction flows from the Due Process Clause and restricts judicial power as a matter of individual right. Insurance Corp. of Ireland, Ltd., 456 U.S. at 702-03, 102 S.Ct. 2099. A party may insist that the right be observed or he may waive it. Id. at 703, 102 S.Ct. 2099. Personal jurisdiction, like other individual rights, is often the subject of procedural rules. Id. at 705, 102 S.Ct. 2099. Frequently, when the rules that govern personal jurisdiction are not followed, the right is lost. Id. Thus, the failure to file a timely objection to personal jurisdiction constitutes, under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and comparable state rules, a waiver of the objection. See id.\nThese are time-honored rules. We can find nothing in the Act that would lead us to believe that the requirement of personal jurisdiction covered in \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) is not subject to them. Nor do we discern any intent on Congress\u2019 part to preclude the application of the doctrine of waiver to the statute. We will, therefore, address the merits of Appellee\u2019s contention. Appellee correctly states that under the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, an objection to personal jurisdiction may be waived, if preliminary objections to a complaint raising the issue are not filed within twenty days after service. Pa.R.C.P.1026,1028, 1032(a).\nTo hold Appellant to this time frame, however, is not appropriate under the circumstances, and given the realities of family law, where divorce and economic issues are often determined separately and the parties often choose to settle their respective rights to marital property themselves. See 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3105, 3323(c). Appellee filed a short-form Complaint in Divorce. It contained: identifying information for each party; referred to the parties\u2019 August, 14,1982 marriage; set forth the statutory grounds for divorce; and alleged that no prior action for divorce or annulment had been filed, that the marriage was irretrievably broken and that the action was not collusive. Six general areas were marked as \u201c[o]ther matters claimed\u201d, including \u201cProperty Rights Between Spouses.\u201d The complaint requested that the court issue a divorce decree and determine the other matters. It did not expressly refer to or even allude to any of the marital property, including appellant\u2019s military retirement pay, that the court was to distribute.\nIn this case, Appellant did not contest the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction to resolve the parties\u2019 property rights in general. Indeed, Appellee pursued discovery related to, and the trial court proceeded with, such matters. More than two years after the Complaint in Divorce was served, Appellee filed an inventory of marital assets listing Appellant\u2019s military pension and requested bifurcation of the divorce and the equitable distribution of marital property. It was at this point that Appellant raised his objection to the court\u2019s jurisdiction to distribute his retirement pay, having received notice that the trial court would determine his rights to that particular asset. In light of our construction of the Act, and considering the course this litigation took, we decline to find that Appellant\u2019s failure to file preliminary objections to the Complaint in Divorce, specifically withholding his consent to the court\u2019s distribution of the pay, was a waiver of his right to object to the court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C).\nIt remains to determine whether Appellant consented to the trial court\u2019s authority to distribute the retirement pay. It is well-settled that a party may either expressly or impliedly consent to a court\u2019s personal jurisdiction. Insurance Carp, of Ireland, Ltd., 456 U.S. at 702-05, 102 S.Ct. 2099. In other words, a party may affirmatively state his consent or take such steps or seek such relief that manifest his submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction over his person. Id. It is evident from the record that none of the actions Appellant took constituted consent as we have defined it. Appellant\u2019s acceptance of service, his counsel\u2019s written general appearance, his participation in discovery matters unrelated to the pay, and his attendance at a separate support proceeding do not suffice. The only activity on Appellant\u2019s part which concerned his pay was the filing of preliminary objections to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction and the refusal to consent. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court lacks personal jurisdiction over Appellant under \u00a7 1408(c)(4)(C) to distribute his military pension.\nAccordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court, reversing the order of the trial court granting Appellant\u2019s preliminary objections, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nMadame Justice Newman did not participate in the consideration or decision of this opinion.\n. Section 702 of the Judicial Code, which governs interlocutory appeals, provides in relevant part:\n(b) Interlocutory appeals by permission.-When a court. .. .in making an interlocutory order in a matter in which its final order would be within the jurisdiction of a appellate court, shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate disposition of the matter, it shall so state in such order. The appellate court may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such an order.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702.\n. As the proper construction of the Act implicates a pure question of law, the scope of our review is plenary, Phillips v. A-Best Products Co., 542 Pa. 124, 665 A.2d 1167, 1170 (1995), and our standard of review is limited to determining whether the Superior Court erred as a matter of law. See Stone and Edwards Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Com., Dept. of Ins., 538 Pa. 276, 648 A.2d 304, 307 n. 2 (1994).\n. It bears repeating that \"[i]n promulgating the rules on preliminary objections, it was the intention of this Court to reduce the number of dilatory steps taken by a defendant before filing an answer [to the complaint].\" Vant v. Gish, 412 Pa. 359, 194 A.2d 522, 527 (1963). Although Pa.R.Civ.P.1026 provides that every pleading subsequent of the complaint \u201cshall\" be filed within twenty days after service of the preceding pleading, we have instructed that the word \"shall\u201d in the Rule is not \u201cso mandatory as not to permit exceptions where justice requires.\u201d Fisher v. Hill, 368 Pa. 53, 81 A.2d 860, 862-63 (1951). We have also emphasized that Pa.R.Civ.P.126 provides that the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure are to be \u201cliberally construed to secure the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action.....that a court may disregard any error or defect of procedure which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties; and that the Rules are to be \" 'interpreted with common sense to carry out the purposes for which they were adopted.' \" Id. at 863 (quoting Usner v. Duersmith, 346 Pa. 494 31 A.2d 149, 150 (1943))."}
