{"id": "927556", "contents": "Pee Ctjbiam,\nWe have discovered no merit in any of the assignments of error, except in those relating to the compensation allowed to the appellees. They are to be regarded as faithless trustees or as trustees ex maleficio; and, in either case, the penalty is deprivation of compensation: Swartswalter\u2019s Account, 4 Watts, 77; Berryhill\u2019s Administratrix\u2019s Appeal, 35 Pa. 245; Robinett\u2019s Appeal, 36 Pa. 174; Norris\u2019s Appeal, 71 Pa. 106; Hart\u2019s Estate, 203 Pa. 496. If the rule were otherwise, the law\u2019s premium would be upon faithlessness and bad faith.\nThe credits allowed to the appellees for commissions or compensation are disallowed and the record is remitted, with direction that the judgment in favor of each appellant be increased in the proper proportion and entered in accordance with this opinion."}
