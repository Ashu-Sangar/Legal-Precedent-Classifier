{"id": "1136893", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nPlaintiffs sued in trespass to recover for injuries suffered by the minor plaintiff in an automobile accident, and defendant appeals from the order of the court below granting a new trial.\nAt the conclusion of the testimony in the lower court, defendant\u2019s point for binding instructions was affirmed, and a verdict directed in his favor. The opinion of the court in banc granting a new trial states: \u201cAfter a careful consideration and review of the testimony in this case, we are of the opinion that the trial judge erred in affirming this point [for binding instructions] and should have submitted the case to the jury\u201d to determine the question of defendant\u2019s negligence and the contributory negligence of the minor plaintiff. A supplementary opinion quoting evidence of various witnesses gives in more detail tlie court\u2019s reasons for concluding that a retrial should be had. Following our invariable rule, under such circumstances, we will not disturb an order granting a new trial, \u201cexcept in cases where the record shows an unmistakable abuse of discretion\u201d: Lombardo v. Barilla, 302 Pa. 460, and cases there cited. In the appeal now before us the record fails to show such abuse.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
