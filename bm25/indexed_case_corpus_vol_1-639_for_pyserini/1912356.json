{"id": "1912356", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Cohen,\nAppellant was convicted of murder in the first degree, aggravated robbery and aggravated assault and battery. The jury imposed the penalty at life imprisonment on the murder conviction. This appeal is from the denial of appellant\u2019s post-trial motions for an arrest of judgment or the grant of a new trial.\nThe evidence as presented by the Commonwealth established that the deceased and her sister were assaulted and robbed as they were approaching the entrance to their apartment. As a result of multiple injuries to the head inflicted by the person committing the assault, the deceased died early that evening.\nThe evidence linking appellant to the crime consisted of the testimony of a friend of appellant\u2019s brother that he was with appellant on the day of the assault. He further testified that appellant kept talking, rubbing his hands and looking down the street. Appellant then told the Commonwealth\u2019s witness \u201che was going to get these ladies\u2019 pocketbook.\u201d The witness then stated he immediately looked down the street and saw two women on the left-hand side of the street. He testified that they were the only women in sight, and that the sister of the deceased, who was in court on the day of his testimony, was one of the women. The witness said he did not see the attack but approximately five minutes after his conversation had ended with appellant, he heard the sister of the deceased screaming, \u201cmurder, thief, murder, thief.\u201d\nAppellant contends that he is entitled to an arrest of judgment. We disagree. The only question for our determination is whether there was sufficient circumstantial evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Gooslin, 410 Pa. 285, 189 A. 2d 157 (1963); Commonwealth v. Kravitz, 400 Pa. 198, 161 A. 2d 861 (1960).\nWe believe the testimony revealing the manner and thoughts of appellant only a short time prior to the commission of the crime and what transpired shortly thereafter was sufficient circumstantial evidence to convict appellant. On this basis appellant is not entitled to an arrest of judgment.\nHowever, appellant alleges another ground in support of his motion for a new trial. He vigorously contends that the trial judge erred in admitting in evidence certain color photographs of the victim of the assault. We agree.\nDuring the course of the trial, the Commonwealth called a pathologist to testify as to his findings with respect to a post mortem examination he performed on the deceased. The pathologist was then permitted to exhibit and use color-slide films of the deceased in an effort to help the jury understand his medical testimony. Counsel for appellant strenuously objected on the ground that the photographs were gruesome and could only serve to inflame the minds and arouse the sympathy of the jurors.\nOur Court has frequently held that the admission of photographs exhibiting the body of a deceased in homicide cases is primarily within the discretion of the trial judge. Unless there is a flagrant abuse of discretion, this Court has been loath to conclude that reversible error exists. Commonwealth v. Dickerson, 406 Pa. 102, 176 A. 2d 421 (1962) ; Commonwealth v. Novak, 395 Pa. 199, 150 A. 2d 102 (1959); and Commonwealth v. Peyton, 360 Pa. 441, 450, 62 A. 2d 37, 41 (1948).\nWe are of the opinion that the proper test to be applied by a trial court in determining the admissibility of photographs in homicide cases is whether or not the photographs are of such essential evidentiary value that their need clearly outweighs the likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jurors. Applying this weighing process to the facts of the instant case, we find that the trial judge abused his discretion by admitting the photographs. Here, we have a clear felony murder case where the force used and the nature and extent of the injuries involved have no bearing on a finding of first degree felony murder. Moreover, assuming their relevance with respect to appellant\u2019s intent to commit grievous bodily harm, nowhere is it illustrated to our satisfaction that the pathologist could not have adequately and effectively testified without the use of these photographs. Whatever aid these photographs may have been, their use was clearly outweighed by the emotional impact it would undoubtedly have on the jury. For this reason alone appellant is entitled to a new trial.\nJudgment reversed and a new trial ordered.\nMr. Justice Koberts concurs in the result.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell and Mr. Justice Jones dissent.\nThe fact that the trial judge specifically informed the jury that the photographs were not being shown for prejudicial or inflammatory purposes, but only to aid in the presentation of medical testimony, is of no consequence and could not remedy the error which already had been committed."}
