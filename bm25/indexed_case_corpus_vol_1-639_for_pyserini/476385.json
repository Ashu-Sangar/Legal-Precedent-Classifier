{"id": "476385", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Patterson,\nThe City of Philadelphia appeals from an order of the court below reducing a tax assessment.\nThe Real Estate Trust Building, located at the southeast corner of Broad and Chestnut Streets, Philadelphia, was assessed for the year 1947 at a valuation of $2,796,900, representing an increase of $125,800 over the assessed valuation for the previous year. This was based upon an assessment of $2,211,909 for the ground and $584,948 for the building. The owner, Western Saving Fund Society, appealed to the Board of Revision of Taxes to reduce the assessment, and on its refusal, filed a petition for review in the court below. After hearing, the trial judge reduced the assessment to $2,696,900. Exceptions filed by the City were dismissed by the court en hone and this appeal followed.\nAppellee\u2019s expert witness, whose qualifications are admitted by the City, appraised the property at $2,256,-000, giving the land a valuation of $1,854,000 and the building a valuation of $402,046. This valuation was arrived at by the witness, according to the evidence, \u201cby considering the sale of the property itself, which is recent enough to consider, and other comparable sales; reproduction cost less depreciation, and obsolescence; capitalization of income less operation; and the uniformity of assessments in the immediate neighborhood.\u201d The City\u2019s expert appraised the. property at $2,893,500, valuing the land at $2,317,500 and the building at $576,000.\nThe sole question, according to the City, is the following : \u201cIn an appeal from a tax. assessment, is it competent and admissible for an expert witness to express his opinion- of value of the building assessed, on the basis of reproduction cost less depreciation and obsolescence?\u201d\nAs stated in General Electric Company v. City of Erie, 110 Pa. Superior Ct. 206, 209, 168 A. 534: \u201cIt has been definitely ruled time and again that the reproduction cost of a building is not of controlling effect: Metropolitan Edison Co.\u2019s Appeal, 307 Pa. 401, 161 A. 303; Pennsylvania Stave Company\u2019s Appeal, 236 Pa. 97, 84 A. 761.\u201d See also Algon Realty Company Tax Assessment Appeal, 329 Pa. 321, 322, 198 A. 49; McSorley v. Avalon Borough School District, 291 Pa. 252, 254, 139 A. 848. Under these decisions the evidence of appellee\u2019s expert would have to be disregarded if based on reproduction cost alone. The testimony of the witness reveals, however, that numerous other factors were taken into consideration, all of which have been recognized as properly to be taken into account in fixing the market value of the property. This being the case the. City.has no standing to object that some consideration may have been given to reproduction cost less depreciation and obsolescence. As indicated in McSorley v. Avalon Borough School District, supra, at 264, the objection to reproduction cost arises out of the fact that replacement value will usually be greater than the value of the building as part of the property in its entirety and may be, and sometimes is, in excess of the market value of the property, including the building. Compare Fisher Scientific Company Tax Assessment Case, 360 Pa. 250, 61 A. 2d 857.\nIn tax assessment cases, the findings of the court below determining the value of the property will not be disturbed on appeal unless clear error is made to appear: Felin v. Philadelphia, 354 Pa. 317, 319, 47 A. 2d 227. Upon a review of the entire record we are not convinced that the court below committed such error. The findings establish that the building is outmoded as compared with other business structures in the vicinity, and the figure adopted exceeds by $496,000 the price at which the property had been recently sold.\nOrder affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost.\nCapitalization of income: Algon Realty Company Tax Assessment Appeal, 329 Pa. 321, 323, 198 A. 49.
