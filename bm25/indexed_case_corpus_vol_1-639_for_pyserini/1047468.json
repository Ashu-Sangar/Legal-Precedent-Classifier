{"id": "1047468", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Simpson,\nPlaintiff sued the defendant company to recover damages for injuries received by him as a result of the sudden starting of one of its cars while he was endeavoring to enter it as a passenger. The verdict and judgment were for the plaintiff, and defendant appeals, assigning as error only the refusal of its point asking for binding instructions in its favor, and the dismissal of its motion for judgment non obstante veredicto.\nIn this court defendant\u2019s counsel frankly admits \u201cthat the appellee was thrown by a trolley car under negligent circumstances must be accepted as a proven fact,\u201d and does not allege contributory negligence. His only claim is that the evidence did not justify the conclusion that \u201cthe wrongdoer\u2019s act produced the injuries complained of.\u201d\nAdmittedly the record shows that at least some of the things complained of were the result of defendant\u2019s negligence. Plaintiff was thrown from the car negligently ; was rendered unconscious; as defendant\u2019s motorman testified, plaintiff was found an hour later at the place where he alleges he had endeavored to boar,d the car; and, two days later, when he fully recovered consciousness, he found the fing\u00e9rs of his hand had been cut off in the hospital to which he had been taken by defendant\u2019s employees. It is clear, therefore, that for the wrong done Mm lie was entitled to some damages, whether or not the injury to his hand was the result of defendant\u2019s negligence. Hence the point asking for Mnding in-, structions, and the motion for judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto were properly dismissed, for each is predicated upon the claim that plaintiff is entitled to no damages.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
