{"id": "1769154", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant James Stetler was convicted by a jury of voluntary manslaughter and possession of an instrument of crime for his involvement in the shooting death of his next-door neighbor, Robert Mendel. On these appeals, appellant asserts a number of claimed errors in support of his contention that he should be granted a new trial. Review of the record convinces us that there is no basis for relief. Hence, we affirm.\nThe shooting occurred at approximately 10:30 p. m., May 7, 1977. By the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, shortly before the shooting the victim\u2019s wife Nancy Mendel was forced from her residence and assaulted by James Horner (former husband of appellant\u2019s wife Geraldine Stetler) and Edwin Meredith (friend of the Stetlers and Horner). The Commonwealth sought to establish that, while standing on the front porch common to the Mendel and Stetler residences and waiting for police to arrive, the victim was pulled inside the Stetler residence and shot in the back several times by David Horner (son of James Horner and Geraldine Stetler) and once by appellant.\nAppellant admitted that he had shot the victim, but claimed self-defense. According to appellant, the shooting occurred after the victim had burst without provocation into the Stetler residence, swinging a bat at those inside. Appellant maintained that he had used the gun only to frighten the victim.\nThe jury rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s charges of murder and conspiracy, and returned guilty verdicts on the charges of voluntary manslaughter and possession of an instrument of crime. Maximum consecutive sentences were imposed, totalling seven and one-half to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment.\nAppellant\u2019s first assignment of error relates to trial testimony of Philadelphia Detective Terrence Gibbs, who had immediately investigated the alleged homicide. Gibbs testified that Nicola Stetler (appellant\u2019s four year-old daughter) had told him, \u201cMy mommie didn\u2019t do anything. My daddy shot Mr. Mendel. He busted down our door.\u201d The trial court admitted the out-of-court statement under the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception to the rule against hearsay. Appellant contends that this out-of-court statement failed to satisfy the excited utterance exception and should not have been admitted.\nWe agree with appellant that the out-of-court statement of Nicola Stetler should not have been admitted. Wholly absent here is the required showing that \u201cthe declarant perceived the happening which he or she is talking about.\u201d Commonwealth v. Pronkoskie, 477 Pa. 132,139, 383 A.2d 858, 861 (1978) (youthful declarant\u2019s statement inadmissible as \u201cthere is nothing to indicate that [the declarant] actually saw what occurred\u201d). However, the record fails to disclose any basis for concluding that the out-of-court statement prejudiced appellant. Indeed, the statement supported appellant\u2019s claim of self-defense. Cf. Commonwealth v. Carr, 459 Pa. 262, 266, 328 A.2d 512, 514 (1974) (error in admitting police officer\u2019s notes of appellant\u2019s questioning harmless where \u201cnotes were almost identical to appellant\u2019s trial testimony\u201d). See generally Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 410, 383 A.2d 155, 164-65 (1978) (error harmless \u201c[w]hen the record reveals that [the] error did not prejudice the defendant, or that the prejudice was so minimal that, beyond a reasonable doubt, it did not influence the jury . . . \u201d).\nAppellant\u2019s second claim of error concerns the admission of a set of color photographs of the wife of the victim, taken one week after the alleged assault against her and the shooting of her husband. Examination of the record convinces us that the trial court did not commit an abuse of discretion. The photographs are not unduly inflammatory, and the Commonwealth properly introduced the photographs to confirm the wife\u2019s testimony. No relief is warranted. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Petrakovich, 459 Pa. 511, 521, 329 A.2d 844, 849 (1974); Commonwealth v. Powell, 428 Pa. 275, 278-79, 241 A.2d 119, 121 (1968).\nAppellant\u2019s third claim relates to the timing of his access to a statement Nancy Mendel had given to police. Appellant was furnished a copy of the statement during the Commonwealth\u2019s direct examination of Nancy Mendel. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Hamm, 474 Pa. 487, 378 A.2d 1219 (1977). On the previous day of trial, appellant had been denied a copy during the Commonwealth\u2019s direct examination of the officer who took the statement. Appellant maintains that the previous day\u2019s denial precluded effective cross-examination of the officer. However, appellant fails to demonstrate that the trial court\u2019s ruling prejudiced his ability to cross-examine either Nancy Mendel or the officer taking the statement. Failure to demonstrate prejudice is fatal to appellant\u2019s claim. Compare Hamm, supra, 474 Pa. at 502, 378 A.2d at 1219 (case remanded for inquiry into prejudice where defense counsel not permitted access to statements).\nFourth among appellant\u2019s assertions of error is the claim that a police sergeant who investigate the shooting impermissibly expressed an opinion that a stair railing inside the Stetler home had been dislodged before the shooting. The sergeant, who conducted his investigation about two and one-half hours after the shooting, based his opinion on the absence of debris in the area surrounding the railing. Appellant contends that the sergeant\u2019s opinion testimony was beyond his area of expertise, and that prejudice occurred because the testimony contradicted appellant\u2019s position that the damage to the railing occurred during the incident leading to the shooting.\nLike appellant, we do not believe that the sergeant\u2019s opinion related to his investigatory expertise. See Commonwealth v. Crawford, 468 Pa. 565, 364 A.2d 660 (1976). However, the record fails to disclose any defense evidence, either by way of appellant\u2019s testimony or otherwise, indicating that the victim had damaged the railing upon entry of the residence. Indeed, the only reference to dislodging of the railing appears in the undisputed testimony of a police officer who, approximately one week before the shooting, had investigated an earlier confrontation between the victim and appellant. Thus, even if the police sergeant exceeded the scope of his expertise, his testimony was merely cumulative of other properly admitted evidence and, on this record, harmless. See Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 411-12 nn. 20 \u2014 21, 383 A.2d 155, 165 nn. 20 \u2014 21 (1978) (citing cases).\nAppellant\u2019s fifth assignment of error challenges the sergeant\u2019s testimony, on Commonwealth redirect examination, that except for a statement given by co-defendant Edwin Meredith, statements of other co-defendants indicated that appellant had fired a gun. Appellant objects to this testimony again on the ground that the testimony constituted improper opinion evidence on a matter that should have been left for the jury.\nOn direct examination the police sergeant stated that his examination of the victim indicated that more than one weapon had been fired. Thus the sergeant had all persons present at the scene of the shooting questioned. The sergeant stated that, as a result of the questioning, all five persons at the Stetler residence at the time of the shooting, including appellant, were arrested. On cross-examination, defense counsel pursued the subject of the suspects\u2019 statements:\n\u201cQ. You recognized upon reading these reports and talking to these people that the information that they had could not possibly be accurate based on your observations and determination of more than one weapon was involved, right?\nA. Are you speaking collectively? That they were all incorrect?\nQ. Not necessarily all but you weren\u2019t getting the whole truth from everybody?\nA. Collectively, no.\nQ. I take it, therefore, that at that point you presented the other detectives, the interviewing detectives, with what you and [another officer] had found out or what you believed to be true; isn\u2019t that right?\nA. That is a portion of it, yes.\nQ. And after that, further interviews were conducted; is that right?\nA. Yes.\u201d\nFrom this line of questioning it is clear that the redirect testimony to which appellant objects merely confirmed the sergeant\u2019s testimony, on cross-examination, that he was aware that he had not received an accurate account from the suspects. Appellant cannot prevail on a complaint against redirect testimony which clarifies a matter which he raised on cross-examination. See McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 57 at 132 (Cleary ed. 1972).\nAppellant\u2019s sixth claim challenges the Commonwealth\u2019s introduction of testimony seeking to establish the victim\u2019s reputation as a peaceful and law-abiding citizen. There is no dispute that the Commonwealth was entitled to present this evidence. Appellant\u2019s complaint goes only to the timing of the Commonwealth\u2019s presentation, contending that the evidence was improperly presented during the Commonwealth\u2019s case in chief.\nIt is well established that the Commonwealth cannot offer evidence of the victim\u2019s reputation unless and until the victim\u2019s reputation is put in issue by the defense. Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 403, 383 A.2d 155, 161 (1978). See generally Commonwealth v. Castellana, 277 Pa. 117, 121 A. 50 (1923). However, it is equally settled \u201cthat the order of presentation of evidence is a matter for the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d Commonwealth v. Koch, 446 Pa. 469, 478, 288 A.2d 791, 795 (1972). This discretion encompasses \u201cadmission in chief of evidence which is of a rebutting character.\u201d II Henry on Pennsylvania Evidence \u00a7 729 at 161 n. 96 (1953) (citing cases).\nAppellant has failed to show any prejudice resulting from the court\u2019s ruling on the timing of the Commonwealth\u2019s presentation. \u201c[F]or a court of error to enter minutely into matters of [this] kind, would be to intrench unnecessarily on the right of the court below, and to embarrass the administration of justice, instead of assisting it.\u201d Salmon v. Ranee, 3 S. & R. 310, 313 \u2014 14 (Pa. 1817). Appellant cannot prevail on this claim.\nAppellant\u2019s seventh challenge relates to the trial court\u2019s refusal to permit him to introduce the entire record of the testimony of Geraldine Stetler at her trial for the shooting. At appellant\u2019s trial, Geraldine Stetler testified that appellant and David Horner had shot the victim in self-defense. She also stated that, after the shooting, she had taken a .22 calibre rifle from David Horner, and directed everyone at the scene to tell police that she had shot the victim. Additionally, she stated that she did not see what had happened to the .308 calibre rifle which appellant had fired. In rebuttal, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of a court reporter. The reporter stated that, at her trial, Geraldine Stetler testified that appellant gave the .308 rifle to David Horner, who took the gun away. At the conclusion of the court reporter\u2019s rebuttal testimony, the trial court denied appellant\u2019s request to have the court reporter read all of Geraldine Stetler\u2019s previous testimony.\nThe record indicates that, although the notes of Geraldine Stetler\u2019s previous testimony had not been transcribed, the court reporter was fully available to appellant. Nonetheless, appellant has failed to show that any relevant testimony was excluded as a result of the trial court\u2019s ruling. Thus, as with his previous claim, appellant again fails to establish that he was in any respect prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s ruling.\nAppellant\u2019s eighth claimed error challenges that portion of the prosecuting attorney\u2019s opening statement making reference to the existence of a history of altercations between the Mendels, the Horners, and the Stetlers. Our case law is clear that \u201c[a] district attorney\u2019s remarks in his opening statement must be fair deductions from the evidence the Commonwealth in good faith expects to develop, not merely assertions intended to inflame the passions of the jury.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hughes, 477 Pa. 180, 187, 383 A.2d 882, 886 (1978) (citing cases). We are satisfied that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the prior altercations was, on this record, a proper opening statement. See Commonwealth v. Ulatoski, 472 Pa. 53, 371 A.2d 186 (1977).\nNinth, despite the jury\u2019s verdict of guilty of voluntary manslaughter, appellant claims that the Commonwealth abused its discretion by certifying that the degree of homicide in its case against David Horner rose no higher than murder of the third degree, but not so certifying its case against appellant. Appellant contends that the discrepancy in charges is attributable solely to the ages of the two defendants. On this record, revealing no arbitrary, vindictive, or selective prosecution, we see no basis for disturbing the manner in which the prosecutor exercised the charging function. See Oyler v. Boles, 368 U.S. 448, 82 S.Ct. 501, 7 L.Ed.2d 446 (1962); United States v. Wilson, 639 F.2d 500 (9th Cir. 1981).\nAppellant\u2019s tenth allegation relates to the trial court\u2019s ruling permitting a police officer to read transcripts he prepared of emergency phone calls received by police in connection with the shooting. One of the calls was from appellant who, before the fatal shooting, had told police that \u201csomebody next door just hit my buddy with a bat\u201d and, \u201cHurry up, because I\u2019m going to have my gun. I\u2019m going to take his head off.\u201d After the transcripts were read, tape recordings of the same calls were also played to the jury. Appellant complains that the playing of the tape recordings should have been sufficient.\nAppellant has not disputed either the completeness or the accuracy of the transcript read to the jury. He was afforded full opportunity to cross-examine the officer who prepared and read the transcripts. We are satisfied that the trial court properly exercised its discretion in permitting the procedure employed here. Cf. United States v. Johnson, 363 F.Supp. 711 (E.D.Pa.1971), aff\u2019d, 492 F.2d 1239 (3d Cir. 1974) (approving procedure where jury read transcript while tape was played).\nAppellant\u2019s eleventh claim challenges the propriety of the Commonwealth\u2019s cross-examination of a defense reputation witness. The witness testified that appellant had an \u201cexcellent\u201d reputation for being a law-abiding, peaceful citizen. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked the witness if she had ever been in the company of appellant at social events. After the witness responded in the affirmative, the following colloquy ensued:\n\u201cQ. Was Mr. Stetler a drinker?\nA. We all \u2014 well, heavy drinker, you mean?\nQ. Yes.\nA. At times we all are heavy drinkers.\u201d\nOn redirect, the witness indicated that appellant did not display violent tendencies while \u201cdrinking heavily.\u201d On recross-examination, purportedly calling upon the witness\u2019s familiarity with appellant\u2019s reputation \u201cfor being a peaceful and law-abiding person,\u201d the prosecutor asked the witness whether she knew that, about one year before the shooting, appellant had been arrested and convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol. The court sustained defense objection and told the jury, \u201c[djon\u2019t concern yourselves with any past convictions of driving while intoxicated. We are not concerned about that.\u201d The court denied the defense\u2019s request for a mistrial. This ruling is now challenged.\nAlthough the Commonwealth suggests that the prosecuting attorney\u2019s questioning on recross-examination was proper, and that the trial court acted out of an \u201cabundance of caution\u201d in sustaining defense objection, the record is clear that the trial court correctly sustained the objection. Notwithstanding the prosecutor\u2019s allusion to the witness\u2019s familiarity with appellant\u2019s community reputation, the clear thrust of the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of the reputation witness was to put before the jury the fact that appellant had been previously convicted of driving while intoxicated. Such questioning is impermissible. See Commonwealth v. Jenkins, 413 Pa. 606, 198 A.2d 497 (1964). See also McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 191 at 457 n. 74 (Cleary ed. 1972).\nHowever, we agree with the trial court that the error is not of sufficient magnitude to warrant relief. Manifestly, there is the danger that, finding a previous offense, the jury will \u201cshort cut the reputation process and use it more directly to convict in the case on trial.\u201d McCormick, supra. But here the conviction of driving while intoxicated could have little bearing on the offenses with which appellant presently was charged. Evidence of the conviction added little to the undisputed fact that appellant drank on occasion, and intoxication was irrelevant both to the Commonwealth\u2019s case and to appellant\u2019s.\nThe twelfth contention challenges the admission of evidence tending to show harassment of the victim, including evidence that approximately one week before the shooting, firecrackers had been thrown at the victim and a gun was pointed at the victim while the victim was at home. However, this challenged evidence in no respect implicated appellant. Appellant has failed to show how this evidence prejudiced him. See Commonwealth v. Story, supra, 476 Pa. at 410, 383 A.2d at 155.\nIn his thirteenth claim, appellant asserts that the Commonwealth improperly questioned him concerning his failure to tell police that he shot the victim in self-defense. In appellant\u2019s view, such questioning constituted improper comment upon his constitutional right to remain silent. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Easley, 483 Pa. 337, 396 A.2d 1198 (1979). But appellant did not remain silent following arrest. Instead, he presented a version of the shooting to police which he later admitted, at trial, to be false. As in a recent case, \u201c[t]he prosecutor was merely attempting to impeach appellant\u2019s credibility by pointing out an inconsistency between appellant\u2019s post-arrest statement and his trial testimony.\u201d Commonwealth v. Beavers, 492 Pa. 522, 531, 424 A.2d 1313, 1318 (1981). The right to remain silent has not been intruded upon, and relief is not warranted.\nIn his final contention appellant challenges the sentence imposed, on the grounds that the sentence is excessive and that the court failed to state its reasons adequately. See generally Commonwealth v. Kostka, 475 Pa. 85, 389 A.2d 884 (1977); Commonwealth v. Riggins, 474 Pa. 115, 377 A.2d 140 (1977). Appellant was sentenced on November 29, 1978, well after July 1, 1978, when Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 1410 became effective. Under Rule 1410, appellant was obliged to file a written motion to modify sentence within ten days. His failure to do so precludes appellate review. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Ruschel, 280 Pa.Super. 187, 421 A.2d 468 (1980). See also Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nIn a related argument, appellant objects to police testimony that co-defendant Meredith was very arrogant after the shooting. Again, appellant has failed to show prejudice. See Commonwealth v. Story, supra."}
