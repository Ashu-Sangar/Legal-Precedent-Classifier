{"id": "874056", "contents": "Opinion bv\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nWhen the defendant, as prothonotary of the court of common pleas of Clarion county, was directed to issue the alias (improperly called \u201c pluries \u201d ) testatum fieri facias in question, it was manifestly his duty to inspect the record of plaintiff\u2019s judgment and see that the writ conformed thereto in every material particular. If he neglected to do so and in consequence thereof any part of the-claim was lost, he is liable to respond in damages to the extent of plaintiff\u2019s loss. As shown by the record the judgment was regularly entered \u201c by virtue of a warrant of attorney .... for the sum of one hundred and one dollars, with interest, from May 31st, 1875, with costs of suit, release of errors, without stay of execution, and waiving exemption and inquisition.\u201d The concluding waivers of \u201c exemption and inquisition \u201d are important features of the judgment, and should clearly appear in the body of the writ or by indorsement thereon, so that the sheriff charged with its execution may be fully advised that the defendant has waived his right to claim the benefit of the exemption law, and has consented to the condemnation of any real estate that may be taken in execution for the purpose of satisfying the judgment. In Hageman v. Salisberry, 74 Pa. 280, it was held that the terms and conditions of a confessed judgment, including waiver of inquisition and exemption, enter into and form a part of the judgment, modifying and qualifying its effect. That being so, it follows as a matter of course that on issuing execution process on such judgment, it is the duty of the prothonotary to follow the record thereof and not only recite or note the amount of the judgment, etc., but also its terms and conditions so far as the proper execution of the process may be affected thereby.\nThe fieri facias to the sheriff of Clarion county, and the testatum fieri facias to Clearfield county, both of which were re-burned nulla bona, were properly indorsed, respectively: \u201c-Waivers, waiving exemption and inquisition,\u201d and \u201c waiving stay of execution, exemption and inquisition: \u201d but, when the defendant came to issue the alias testatum in question, he neglected to note, in any form, the waiver of exemption and inquisition which so plainly appears upon the record of the judgment.\nThe result of this was that when the sheriff levied on personal property of one of the defendants more than sufficient to have satisfied the judgment, debt, interest and costs, the defendant claimed the benefit of the $300, exemption, and the property was accordingly appraised and all set apart to him under his-claim. Nothing was realized on the execution.\nThe testimony tended to show, and the jury would have been justified in finding as a fact, that plaintiff\u2019s claim was lost in consequence of defendant\u2019s neglect to indorse the waiver of exemption on the writ.\nIt follows from what has been said, that the court erred in charging as complained of in the first three specifications, and in not affirming plaintiff\u2019s first and second points recited in the fourth and fifth specifications.\nJudgment reversed and venire facias de novo awarded."}
