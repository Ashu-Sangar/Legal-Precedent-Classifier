{"id": "470724", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Drew,\nPlaintiff, J. B. Sack, appeals from a judgment for defendant entered for want of sufficient reply to new matter. He brought this suit in assumpsit on a policy of fire insurance issued to him by defendant, Glens Falls Insurance Company, for a term of one year from September 19, 1944, covering property at several locations in Pittsburgh. A fire on January 8, 1945, caused a property loss at one of these locations, where liability under the policy was limited to a maximum of $20,000.\nThe pleadings are of particular importance in this case. In answer to plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim, which alleged that the sum of $20,000 was due under the policy, defendant filed an affidavit of defense which admitted liability for $5,281.88, and set up new matter which averred, inter alia, that the value of the property set forth in a report, filed by plaintiff on December 1, 1944, was \u201cfalse, incorrect and untrue\u201d. Plaintiff took judgment in the amount admitted, and filed a reply which specifically denied the alleged fraud and asserted, that \u201cPlaintiff made an inadvertant and unintentional mistake in Ms method of valuation\u201d.\nBoth parties claimed judgment on the pleadings. After argument before the court en banc, plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment for want of sufficient affidavit of defense with new matter was denied and defendant\u2019s motion for judgment for want of a sufficient reply was granted. Plaintiff then took this appeal.\nUnder the policy here involved, both the amount of insurance coverage, and the premium were provisional and subject to increase or reduction dependent upon the value of goods reported by plaintiff to defendant. Within thirty days after the end of each month plaintiff was required to submit a report of value and for September, October and November, 1944, he did so. On the day of the fire, January 8,1945, plaintiff had not yet submitted the December report, but the day after the fire he submitted the report and this dispute arose.\nPlaintiff contends that as the value reported to defendant on January 9, 1945, the day after the fire, was within the thirty day period after \u201cDecember 31,1944, it should form the basis of his recovery. On the contrary defendant asserts that the value of the property on November 30, 1944, as set forth in the report filed on or about December 1, 1944, determines the extent of its liability under the insurance contract.\nIt is necessary to closely examine the terms of the policy to determine which report forms the basis of defendant\u2019s liability. The applicable provisions are as follows: \u201c10. VALUE REPORTING CLAUSE \u2014 It is a condition of this policy that the insured shall report to this Company not later than thirty (30) days after the' last day of each month, the exact location of all property covered hereunder, the total value of such property at each location and all specific insurance in force at each of such locations on the last day of each month. At the time of any loss, if the insured has failed to file with this Company reports of values as above required, this policy, subject otherwise to all its terms and conditions, shall cover only at the locations and for not more than the amounts included in the last report of values, filed prior to the loss.\n\u201c11. FULL REPORTING CLAUSE \u2014 Liability under this policy shall not in any case exceed that proportion of any loss hereunder, which the last reported value less the amount of specific insurance reported, if any, at the location where any loss occurs bears to the actual value less the amount of specific insurance, if any, at that location at the time of such report. Liability for loss hereunder, occurring at any location acquired since filing the last report (except as provided by the Value Reporting Clause), shall be apportioned in a like manner except that the proportion used shall be the relation that values reported at all locations less the amount of reported specific insurance, if any, bear to the actual values less the amount of specific insurance, if any, at all locations at the time of such report.\u201d\nThe court below held that \u201cthe last reported value\u201d in section 11 refers to the last report filed before the loss occurred. With this interpretation of the policy we cannot agree. If the parties had intended that section 11 of the policy should mean last reported value filed prior to the loss, they would have so stated. The words used are clear and unambiguous and were selected by defendant, the insurer, who prepared the policy. \u201cContracts of insurance should be construed so as to carry out the true intentions of the parties\u201d: Couch, Cyclopedia of Insurance Law, Vol. 1, section 188. Nor will defendant\u2019s position be more favorable if we assume that the words used were ambiguous. In Gnagey v. Pa. Thresh. & F. M. Cas. I. Co., 332 Pa. 193, 196, 2 A. 2d 740, we said: \u201cIn case of doubt or ambiguity, the provisions of an insurance policy will be viewed in the light most favorable to the insured: Brams v. New York Life Ins. Co., 299 Pa. 11; Janney v. Scranton Life Ins. Co., 315 Pa. 200,\u201d\nThe obvious purpose of the thirty-day limit, set forth in section 10, within which plaintiff was to file the report, was to enable the insurer to receive its full premium and to enable the insured to obtain maximum insurance coverage in the event of a fire. If this court would read into section 11 the phrase \u201cfiled prior to the loss\u201d, as the court below has erroneously done, it would destroy the clear meaning of the contract and nullify the time limit of thirty days specifically agreed upon by the parties. The report filed January 9, 1945, was the \u201clast reported value\u201d within the meaning of section 11, as we construe the language of this contract.\nIt was also error for the learned court below to assAime that plaintiff used \u201ca false figure\u201d for the total value of the property, at this particular location, in the report filed December 1, 1944, because that was a question of fact which only a jury could determine. In paragraph 19, under new matter, defendant averred that the value set forth in the report for November was \u201cfalse, incorrect and untrue\u201d and alleged sufficient facts to support the averment if believed by a jury. HoAvever, in plaintiff\u2019s reply, the fraud alleged was specifically denied. It is Avell established that in passing on the sufficiency of a reply to new matter, the averments of the reply must be accepted as true: Smith v. Faust, 92 Pa. Superior Ct. 267; Busby v. Harrisburg P. & P. B. Co., 312 Pa. 394, 167 A. 313; Smith v. Girard Trust Company, 320 Pa. 412, 183 A. 47. See Standard Pennsylvania Practice, Vol. 4, Chap. 17. \u00a78.\nThe pleadings contain an adequate averment by defendant of fraud on the part of plaintiff, and a sufficient denial by plaintiff. Therefore, the question of fraud is at issue and a trial must be had. If the jury finds that the plaintiff was guilty of fraud as alleged by the defendant, the following provision of this insurance policy would be applicable: \u201cThis entire policy shall be void if the insured has concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance concerning this insurance or the subject thereof; or in case of any fraud or false swearing by the insured touching any matter relating to this insurance or the subject thereof, whether before or after a loss.\u201d However, if no fraud on the part of plaintiff is proved, then he is entitled to recover on the basis of the report filed January 9, 1945.\nThe assignments of error are sustained. The judgment entered by the court below in favor of the defendant for want of a sufficient reply to the new matter set up in the affidavit of defense must be reversed.\nJudgment reversed with a procedendo.\nMr. Justice Jones dissents."}
