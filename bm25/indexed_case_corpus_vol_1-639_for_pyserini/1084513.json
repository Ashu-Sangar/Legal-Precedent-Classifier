{"id": "1084513", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nMary McDonnell claimed compensation for the death of her husband Patrick McDonnell, who died June 2, 1922, the referee made an award which was approved by the compensation board and affirmed by the court below; this appeal followed.\nThe board found as facts that, on May 31, 1922, while in the course of his employment, McDonnell slipped and fell from defendant Mahedy\u2019s coal wagon to the street, \u201cstriking on his head\u201d; the following morning he complained of pain and, later, lapsed into unconsciousness, from which state there was no recovery; finally, that the injury thus sustained was responsible for his death.\nThough admitting the fact of the fall, appellants contend there is no evidence McDonnell received injuries at that time which were the cause of his death. We have read the stenographer\u2019s notes and agree with the learned court below that \u201cthe testimony warranted the referee and compensation board in concluding that McDonnell\u2019s death was due to the fall and injury to his head suffered while in the course of his employment by defendant,\u201d at least, there is evidence on the record to warrant inferences to that effect, and this is sufficient: Thomas v. State Workmen\u2019s Ins. Fund, 280 Pa. 331.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
