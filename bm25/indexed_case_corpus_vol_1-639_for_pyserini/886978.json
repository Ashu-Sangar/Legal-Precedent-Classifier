{"id": "886978", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn view of the evidence in support of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, and the absence of any testimony on which to base a valid defense, the learned president of the common pleas was clearly right in directing the jury to find in favor of the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim. There was no error in excluding the offers recited in the first and second specifications respectively, nor is there anything in the case that requires further notice.\nJudgment affirmed."}
