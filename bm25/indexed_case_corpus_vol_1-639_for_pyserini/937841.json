{"id": "937841", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe learned judge below found first that this was a bill for an account by one claiming to be a joint owner, but who was out of possession and had not established his title at law, referring to Frisbee\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 144; and secondly that the only question in the case was the title and possession of land in West Virginia. Either ground would require the dismissal of the bill.\nDecree affirmed."}
