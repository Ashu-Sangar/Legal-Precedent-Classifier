{"id": "4087982", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 16th day of April, 2008, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is hereby GRANTED. The issues, as stated by Petitioners, are:\n1. Did the Superior Court err as a matter of state and federal law, in reversing the trial judge\u2019s finding that Conrail intended to abandon the line without railbanking, when:\na. Conrail testified that they expressly refused to rail-bank \u201cprivately\u201d or \u201cpublicly;\u201d\nb. Conrail testified that \u201cthey did not enter into any kind of rail banking agreement with any party;\u201d and\nc. Conrail proposed and entered an agreement of sale in which they did not retain any right to reenter or reactivate the line; the Superior Court\u2019s decision conflicts with prior Superior Court decisions in this case that Conrail abandoned all past, present, and future interest in the easement[?]\n2. Did the Superior Court err as a matter of state and federal law when it held that the mere sale of a former easement, created for railroad purposes only, to a private trail sponsor must result in a railbanking?\n8. Did the Superior Court err as a matter of law when it held that trail use constituted continued rail use under Pennsylvania law?\n4. Does the Superior Court\u2019s holding result in an unconstitutional taking, as Respondents:\na. Are not a municipality with powers of eminent domain authorized by the PA Act as was the case in Buffalo Twp; and\nb. Cannot meet the requirements of the National Trails System Act; including the voluntary agreement of the railroad to railbank?\nJustice McCAFFERY did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter."}
