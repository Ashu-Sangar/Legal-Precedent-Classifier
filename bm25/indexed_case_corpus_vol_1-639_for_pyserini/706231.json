{"id": "706231", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nCASTILLE, Justice:\nAppellee John L. Thompson, who suffered work-related injuries while in the employ of appellant Craig Welding and Equipment Rental (\u201cCraig\u201d), received workers\u2019 compensation and medical benefits through Craig and its workers\u2019 compensation carrier, appellant USF & G Company (\u201cUSF & G\u201d). Thompson also filed and settled mid-trial a product liability action against the entities who manufactured, distributed and/or owned the equipment on which he was injured. Following the settlement, appellants filed a Petition to Suspend Compensation and Enforce Subrogation Lien pursuant to \u00a7 319 of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 671. A workers\u2019 compensation judge granted the petition and the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board affirmed, both adjudicative bodies finding that the statutory right of subrogation was absolute. A divided Commonwealth Court panel reversed in a published opinion, finding that the \u201cequities\u201d it perceived defeated the employer\u2019s statutorily mandated right of subrogation. This Court granted review to consider the proper scope of the right of subrogation provided by \u00a7 319. For the reasons that follow, we vacate the order of the Commonwealth Court and remand for proceedings consistent with this Opinion.\nOn August 5, 1988, appellee was testing an Omni 60 aerial platform that Craig intended to purchase when the tip boom, ie., the top-most boom, suddenly collapsed causing appellee to suffer injuries to his skull, jaw, ribs and teeth. Eleven days after the collapse, Craig conducted an inspection and tear-down of the Omni 60 to determine the cause of the accident. USF & G retained an expert who was present during the inspection and tear-down. William Craig, owner of appellant Craig, a Craig employee, the owner of the crane, a representative of the manufacturer and appellee\u2019s father were also present at the inspection. According to a report submitted by USF & G\u2019s expert, the design specifications of the aerial platform required that the tip boom\u2019s chain anchor plate be secured by five bolts to the lower end of the scaffold boom. Three of the bolts with lock washers still attached had backed out of the plate and were found in the bottom of the housing. A fourth bolt was severed in two, and the fifth bolt was never found. The expert opined that the collapse resulted from four of the bolts working loose and the remaining bolt failing due to overload and fatigue cracking. When the inspection was concluded, William Craig took possession of the three undamaged bolts and the two damaged pieces and certified in a memorandum that he had possession of the bolts from the damaged Omni 60.\nAppellee filed a product liability action against Pettibone Corporation, Doering Equipment, Inc., and Marlift, Inc., i.e., the manufacturers, suppliers and/or owners of the platform. Pettibone Texas Corporation subsequently was added as an additional defendant. The matter went to trial in November of 1993 at which time appellee called as a witness the USF & G expert who attended the inspection and tear-down of the Omni 60. The expert testified that the tip boom collapsed because its chain anchor plate was attached to the crane by only one bolt which broke as a result of overload. He further testified that the three intact bolts found in the crane housing had backed out of the chain anchor plate either because they were not properly torqued during maintenance or because the manufacturer failed to anticipate that the Omni 60 would be subject to vibrations during normal use causing the bolts to back out on their own. The expert also stated that, if he had the bolts, he could compare them to the bolts required by the design specifications and ascertain whether they were the correct grade of bolts, determine if they were the original bolts installed at the time of manufacture or replacement bolts installed by the owner, and could measure for any elongation in the bolts. By the time of trial some five years since the inspection of the platform, however, William Craig had inadvertently lost the bolts. No party had requested to inspect the bolts between the August 1988 inspection and the spring of 1993.\nOn November 18, 1993, the third day of trial, the product liability defendants filed a motion in limine requesting that appellee be precluded from presenting any evidence of medical or indemnity benefits paid by USF & G as workers\u2019 compensation carrier for Craig as a sanction for appellee\u2019s inability to produce the bolts at trial. The trial court ruled that the loss of the bolts substantially deprived defendants of the ability to prepare a defense and granted the motion in limine. At the request of the trial court, counsel for USF & G and Craig, who were not parties to the product liability action, were present at the time the motion in limine was argued and granted. The same day, appellee settled his product liability action for $300,000. The settlement was structured in a way that was obviously intended to defeat the employer\u2019s subrogation right: specifically, $200,000 was apportioned to appellee John Thompson and designated as compensation for pain and suffering, while $100,000 was apportioned to his wife for loss of consortium. On February 2, 1994, the trial court entered an order approving the terms of the settlement, including the parties\u2019 designation and allocation of the settlement funds. The court stated that the settlement was exclusive of all medical bills and lost wage payments because those claims were precluded by the court\u2019s in limine ruling. The court also opined, gratuitously in light of the fact that the issue was not before it, that USF & G\u2019s \u201csubrogation claim has been completely compromised by its insured\u2019s destruction of vital evidence in the case.\u201d\nOn April 14, 1994, appellants filed their petition to suspend compensation to appellee and enforce their subrogation lien. On January 23, 1995, the workers\u2019 compensation judge (\u201cWCJ\u201d) granted the petition finding that: (1) appellants\u2019 subrogation right was absolute; (2) the allegations of wrongdoing against Craig were insufficient to deprive appellants of their subrogation right; (3) appellee and the defendants in the third party action could not unilaterally allocate the settlement proceeds in such a way as to deprive appellants of their full subrogation right; and (4) the amount of the settlement allocated to loss of consortium was subject to subrogation because there was no agreement between Craig and appellee regarding the amount of loss of consortium or an adjudication determining the actual amount of loss of consortium damages. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (\u2018WCAB\u201d) affirmed the WCJ\u2019s decision on December 20, 1996, holding that the WCJ had not committed an error of law and that the findings of fact were supported by substantial, competent evidence. See Bethenergy Mines, Inc. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Skirpan), 531 Pa. 287, 612 A.2d 434 (1992).\nOn direct appeal, a divided Commonwealth Court panel reversed the WCAB in a published opinion. The panel majority concluded that appellants were barred on \u201cequitable grounds\u201d from enforcing their statutory subrogation right. The majority analogized the situation to a personal injury claimant who inadvertently destroys or loses a defective product, noting that such a plaintiff \u201cmay be barred from recovering any damages from the alleged tortfeasor.\u201d The majority saw no reason why an employer and its compensation carrier who lose the defective product, as William Craig did here, should be entitled to what it viewed as \u201cdisparate treatment.\u201d The majority also found that appellants\u2019 failure to intervene in the product liability action to protect their subrogation interest, particularly after the trial court in that matter precluded evidence of lost wages and medical expenses in response to Craig having lost the bolts, was another factor weighing in favor of denying subrogation on \u201cequitable\u201d grounds. In reaching its decision, the majority distinguished Winfree v. Philadelphia Electric Company, 520 Pa. 392, 554 A.2d 485 (1989), a case that appellants cite for the proposition that the statutory right of subrogation is absolute. The majority concluded that this Court merely held that an \u201cinsufficient equitable basis\u201d existed to deny subrogation in Winfree.\nJudge Leadbetter dissented. In her view, this Court in Winfree \u201cstated unequivocally\u201d that the employer\u2019s right to subrogation under \u00a7 319 is absolute. In addition, the Commonwealth Court itself had held in Kelly v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (A-P-A Transport Corp.), 107 Pa. Cmwlth.223, 527 A.2d 1121 (1987) that equitable considerations do not outweigh the mandatory language of \u00a7 319. In the alternative, Judge Leadbetter would have found insufficient equitable reasons to defeat the statutory right in this case.\nThis Court\u2019s scope of review in workers\u2019 compensation matters is limited to determining whether constitutional rights were violated, whether an error of law was committed, or whether the findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 704; Udvari v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (USAir, Inc.), 550 Pa. 319, 322, 705 A.2d 1290, 1291 (1997). Although the WCJ\u2019s decision must be based on substantial evidence, the WCJ is the ultimate finder of fact and the exclusive arbiter of credibility and evidentiary weight. LTV Steel v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Mozena), 562 Pa. 205, 223, 754 A.2d 666, 676 (2000) (citing Bethenergy Mines v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Sebro), 132 Pa.Cmwlth.288, 572 A.2d 843, 844-15 (1990)).\nPertinent to the issues before this Court, the WCJ found that: William Craig retained the bolts when the Omni 60 was dismantled; all parties to the product liability action requested an examination of the bolts during the third party lawsuit; William Craig inadvertently lost the bolts resulting in a motion in limine to preclude evidence of wage loss and medical bills in the third party lawsuit; the trial judge in that suit held a conference in chambers to rule on the motion in limine at which USF & G\u2019s attorney and claims personnel were present; USF & G\u2019s attorney and claims personnel were present at various stages of the trial, but USF & G was never a party to the action nor asked to file briefs; prior to trial, during trial and during settlement negotiations, USF & G\u2019s counsel placed appellee and the defendants in the action on notice of its subrogation lien for indemnity and medical benefits paid.\nThere is no dispute that these findings of fact are based upon substantial evidence since, for the most part, they derive from a stipulation of the parties. Nor is there any allegation that constitutional rights have been violated. Therefore, this Court\u2019s review is limited to determining whether the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding on the question of subrogation was an error of law. Questions of law, of course, are subject to plenary review. Universal Am-Can, Ltd. v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Minteer), 563 Pa. 480, 486 n. 2, 762 A.2d 328, 331 n. 2 (2000).\nThe principal legal issue before this Court is whether an employer\u2019s subrogation right under \u00a7 319 is absolute. The secondary issue is whether ad hoc \u201cequitable\u201d factors such as those cited by the Commonwealth Court panel majority \u2014 William Craig\u2019s inadvertent loss of the bolts resulting in the preclusion of evidence of medical bills and lost wages in the product liability action and appellants\u2019 failure to intervene in that action to further protect their subrogation interest\u2014 warrant a conclusion that the employer in this case is equitably estopped from seeking subrogation.\nAlthough originally a common law equitable doctrine, subrogation today may arise by statute or by virtue of an express agreement between the parties, as well as through operation of common law equitable principles. Here, subrogation arises by operation of a statute. Specifically, \u00a7 319 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act establishes that an employer is subrogated to his employee\u2019s rights against third parties for compensable work injuries:\nWhere the compensable injury is caused in whole- or in part by the act or omission of a third party, the employer shall be subrogated to the right of the employe, his personal representative, his estate or his dependents, against such third party to the extent of the compensation payable under this article by the employer; reasonable attorney's fees and other proper disbursements incurred in obtaining a recovery or in effecting a compromise settlement shall be prorated between the employer and employe, his personal representative, his estate or his dependents. The employer shall pay that proportion of the attorney\u2019s fees and other proper disbursements that the amount of compensation paid or payable at the time of recovery or settlement bears to the total recovery or settlement. Any recovery against such third person in excess of the compensation theretofore paid by the employer shall be paid forthwith to the employe, his personal representative, his estate or his dependents, and shall be treated as an advance payment by the employer on account of any future installments of compensation.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 671. The statute is clear and unambiguous. It is written in mandatory terms and, by its terms, admits of no express exceptions, equitable or otherwise. Furthermore, it does more than confer a \u201cright\u201d of subrogation upon the employer; rather, subrogation is automatic. See Smith v. Yellow Cab Co., 288 Pa. 85, 89, 135 A. 858, 860 (1927) (\u00a7 319 establishes \u201cthat the employer is not given a right of subrogation only, but is \u2018subrogated\u2019 to the extent of the compensation paid\u201d) (emphasis supplied).\nIn Winfree, this Court found the meaning of \u00a7 319 to be clear and unambiguous and recognized that it generally established an absolute right of subrogation:\n[T]he statute clearly and unambiguously states that, \u201c ... the employer shall be subrogated to the right of the employee ... against such third party to the extent of compensation payable.... \u201d The legislature could not have manifested more clearly its intent that the subrogation rights of the employer are absolute. We have consistently held in the past that the purpose of the Act was to provide the employee an exclusive right to benefits without the necessity of proving fault in exchange for abrogation of the employee\u2019s common law negligence remedies. LeFlar v. Gulf Creek Indus. Park No. 2, 511 Pa. 574, 515 A.2d 875 (1986); Socha v. Metz, 385 Pa. 632, 123 A.2d 837 (1956). Following the statutory scheme, we recently held that the failure to raise the Act as an affirmative defense to a tort action did not result in a waiver. LeFlar, supra. Therefore, as a general principle of law, the employer\u2019s subrogation rights are statutorily absolute and can be abrogated only by choice.\nId. at 396-97, 554 A.2d at 487. Similarly, in Curtis v. Simpson Chevrolet, 348 F.Supp. 1062 (E.D.Pa.1972), the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania recognized the generally absolute nature of \u00a7 319 subrogation. There, the employee received workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries suffered when the brakes on the truck he was driving failed while he was descending a steep hill. The employee sued two third parties who he alleged negligently repaired and maintained the truck. The third party action was settled, and the employer and its worker\u2019s compensation carrier sought subrogation under \u00a7 319. The employee argued that subrogation was an equitable doctrine; that his employer and the carrier had an affirmative duty to assist him in his efforts to recover in the third party action; and that, the employer and carrier having failed in that duty, equity demanded that they be denied subrogation. The district court rejected the employee\u2019s argument, finding that the right of subrogation remained absolute:\nAgainst this argument must be weighed the plain wording of the statute. It does not give the employer a mere right to be subrogated but says that the employer \u201cshall be subrogated.\u201d ... The legislative mandate is clear \u2014 the employer is to have a right to full subrogation \u2014 and the courts have interpreted the statute accordingly.\nId. at 1064. Accord Kelly v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (A-P-A Transport Corp.), 527 A.2d at 1122.\nIn its fashioning of an equitable exception to the absolute statutory language, the Commonwealth Court here relied upon a discussion in Winfree that followed this Court\u2019s recognition in that case that the employer\u2019s subrogation right is generally absolute. Specifically, the Winfree Court addressed and rejected a claim made by the employee there, which had been accepted by the lower courts, that the employer should be \u201cestopped from exercising its subrogation rights by equitable principles.\u201d 520 Pa. at 397, 554 A.2d at 487. The lower courts had denied the employer subrogation because it did not fully cooperate with the employee in the third party negligence action. In evaluating the equitable estoppel claim, this Court noted that the employer\u2019s actions had to be viewed in the context of the negligence action, since the employer had been joined there as a third-party defendant. Since the employer and employee were in adversarial positions in that litigation, it was reasonable for the employer to be less than fully cooperative. Furthermore, we noted, acceptance of the estoppel argument would place the employer in the \u201cdubious position of cooperating with its employee and running the risk of being found solely liable for vigorously pursuing its own exoneration and losing its subrogation rights.\u201d Stating that we would not subject employers to this choice, we held that the statutory right of subrogation remained absolute under the circumstances of that case. Id. at 399, 554 A.2d at 488.\nIt is the fact that the Winfree Court addressed the equitable estoppel claim at all, of course, that led the Commonwealth Court panel majority here to conclude that the statutory subrogation right is subject to defeat under the ad hoc weighing of factors inherent in the doctrine of equitable estoppel. That Winfree addressed and rejected the particular claim of equitable estoppel forwarded there, however, does not definitively resolve the more fundamental question of whether the statutory subrogation right is subject to avoidance upon ad hoc equitable grounds at all. The holding in Winfree, as well as this Court\u2019s plain language interpretation of the statute in the case, affirmed that the statutory right was absolute. Some discussion of the equitable estoppel claim was necessitated by the fact that the lower courts had actually accepted that argument. That this Court could have rejected the lower courts\u2019 analysis outright as a matter of law, in accordance with the plain language of the statute, does not mean that our engaging and rejecting the analysis on the narrower terms presented amounted to an indirect approval of a construction of the statute that was at odds with our own earlier recognition that subrogation was generally absolute.\nThe notion that ad hoc equitable limitations should be available no doubt derives from the common law roots of the subrogation doctrine. Subrogation was an equitable device adopted at common law, which prevented double recovery and ensured that the party at fault, rather than an innocent party, be held responsible for the injury claimed. E.g., Dale Manufacturing Co. v. Bressi, 491 Pa. 493, 496, 421 A.2d 653, 654 (1980); Helms Express v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Lemonds), 106 Pa.Cmwlth. 287, 525 A.2d 1269, 1270-71 (1987). Because of its roots in equity, the common law doctrine was itself subject to equitable limitations. See, e.g., Roberts v. Fireman\u2019s Ins. Co., 376 Pa. 99, 107, 101 A.2d 747, 750-51 (1954); Smith v. Yellow Cab Co., 288 Pa. at 89, 135 A. at 860.\nNotwithstanding the equitable roots and nature of subrogation, this Court cannot ignore the fact that the subrogation right at issue here does not derive from common law judicial authority but, rather, is expressly granted by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. When the General Assembly adopted subrogation as a statutory matter in the workers\u2019 compensation context, it provided for no equitable exceptions that would eliminate the employer\u2019s subrogation right. Rather, the General Assembly determined that the employer was entitled to subrogation whenever an employee\u2019s injuries, for which the employer paid compensation, were caused by a third party and the employee received a recovery for the compensable injuries from that third party.\nIt is not difficult to see why the General Assembly might reach such a conclusion. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act balances competing interests. The Act obliges subscribing employers to provide compensation to injured employees, regardless of fault, either through insurance or self-insurance. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 501. In exchange, employers are vested with two important rights: the exclusivity of the remedy of worker\u2019s compensation and the concomitant immunity from suit by an injured employee, see 77 P.S. \u00a7 481; and the absolute right of subrogation respecting recovery from third-party tortfeasors who bear responsibility for the employee\u2019s compensable injuries. See Curtis, 348 F.Supp. at 1064 (\u201cOne of the inducements for taking part in the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation plan is provided by the grant of subrogation rights\u201d). This leads to the conclusion that an employer who complies with its responsibilities under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act should not be deprived of one of the corresponding statutory benefits based upon a court\u2019s ad hoc evaluation of other perceived \u201cequities.\u201d Had the General Assembly intended to introduce such uncertainty into an otherwise balanced and certain scheme of relative responsibility, it could have done so expressly or by use of less certain language. The General Assembly already having weighed the equities, it would be inappropriate for this Court to approve of ad hoc equitable exceptions to subrogation.\nAlthough our disapproval of ad hoc equitable exceptions to the statutory right of subrogation, such as those relied upon by the Commonwealth Court below, is enough to decide this particular case, this Court is aware that there may be circumstances where an employer undertakes in deliberate bad faith to subvert a third party suit brought by its employee, circumstances which might require a different calculus. The decision in Curtis v. Simpson Chevrolet, upon which we have relied in part above, recognized this fact. While in that appeal, a claim of bad faith on the part of the plaintiffs employer was abandoned, the court\u2019s opinion suggested that a showing of bad faith or dereliction of duty might have altered its analysis. 348 F.Supp. at 1065. Appellants do not dispute the wisdom of such a limitation, noting instead the absence of any allegation of bad faith here. Brief for Appellants, 20.\nThe General Assembly has directed in the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S., \u00a7 1501 et seq., that the object of interpretation and construction of all statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the General Assembly\u2019s intention. 1 Pa.C S. \u00a7 1921(a). One of the cardinal presumptions in ascertaining the intention of the General Assembly is that it \u201cdoes not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1922(1). Given the substantial benefits conferred upon employers by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and the inherently equitable nature of the doctrine of subrogation, it would be unreasonable to permit an employer both to act in deliberate bad faith to subvert an employee\u2019s third party action, and then to demand subrogation arising from that action. Accordingly, nothing in this Opinion shall be construed as suggesting that subrogation would be appropriate in the face of deliberate, bad faith conduct on the part of the employer. No showing of bad faith has been made here, however; thus the employer\u2019s right to subrogation remains absolute.\nAlthough this holding makes plain the error in the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision, it does not necessarily bring the appeal to an end. Appellee disputes whether the settlement funds at issue are subject to subrogation at all, since appellee and the third party defendants designated the settlement funds as compensation only for appellee\u2019s pain and suffering and appellee\u2019s wife\u2019s loss of consortium, rather than for medical bills and/or lost wages. Based upon these designations in the third party settlement, appellee and his amicus argue that there is no \u201cidentity\u201d or \u201cequatability\u201d of the settlement funds with the monies appellants have paid in workers\u2019 compensation. See Darr Construction Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Walker), 552 Pa. 400, 409, 715 A.2d 1075, 1080 (1998) (doctrine of subrogation implies need for some identity or equatability of funds); Dale Manufacturing Co. v. Bressi, 491 Pa. at 497, 421 A.2d at 655 (right of subrogation arises only where employer shows that he has made payments for work injury arising from negligence of third party \u201cand the fund to which he seeks subrogation was for the same compensable injury for which he is liable under the Act.\u201d). Appellants respond by arguing that the parties to a third party settlement should not be permitted to fashion a settlement in such a way as to defeat an employer\u2019s subrogation interest. See, e.g., Bumbarger v. Bumbarger, 190 Pa.Super. 571, 155 A.2d 216 (1959).\nThis dispute implicates this Court\u2019s recent decision in Darr, where we held that, because a loss of consortium claim is derivative in nature and arises from the impact of the spouse\u2019s physical injuries upon the marriage rather than from the injuries themselves, there is no identity or equatability of funds and, thus, an employer has no subrogation interest in a spouse\u2019s recovery for loss of consortium. Darr also recognized, however, the potential for abuse that exists in this area, as settlement agreements might fraudulently be structured merely to defeat a valid subrogation interest. 552 Pa. at 409-11, 715 A.2d at 1080-81.\nAlthough the WCJ and the WCAB addressed this argument, the Commonwealth Court did not, given its broader holding that appellants were barred on equitable grounds from seeking subrogation at all. The parties have devoted argument to considerations involving the content and timing of the settlement negotiations and whether, given the circumstances surrounding the entry of the settlement agreement, the settlement can truly be accepted as one involving only appellee\u2019s pain and suffering and his wife\u2019s loss of consortium or, rather, was a transparent effort to defeat appellants\u2019 subrogation interest. There is some further dispute as to what is of record and what may properly be considered in resolving this dispute. Given the Commonwealth Court\u2019s failure to address the issue at all and the uncertainty of the record, the better course is to leave consideration to the Commonwealth Court in the first instance. Our summary of the respective positions of the parties shall not be construed as expressing any opinion on the validity of those arguments, including any question as to whether they were properly preserved below.\nAccordingly, for the reasons set forth above, the order of the Commonwealth Court is vacated and the matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Opinion.\nJustice NEWMAN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\nJustice NIGRO files a dissenting opinion.\n. The motion was a renewal of a motion the defendants filed at the time they first learned that the bolts had been lost.\n. As of April 29, 1994, appellants had paid indemnity benefits to appellee in the amount of $8,673.68 and medical benefits in the amount of $97,070.95, for a total of $105,744.63.\n. This finding respecting loss of consortium predated this Court's decision in Darr Construction Co. v. Workmen's Compensation Appeal Board (Walker), 552 Pa. 400, 715 A.2d 1075 (1998), which held that an employer has no subrogation interest in a claimant\u2019s spouse\u2019s loss of consortium recovery.\n. In support of this proposition, the majority cited our decision in Schroeder v. Department of Transp., 551 Pa. 243, 710 A.2d 23 (1998). Schroeder adopted the Third Circuit\u2019s test for determining the proper sanction in cases involving spoliation of evidence. See Schmid v. Milwaukee Electric Tool Corp., 13 F.3d 76 (3d Cir.1994). It bears noting that barring a claim entirely, as the Commonwealth Court did here, is the most extreme of sanctions and not one ineluctably commanded by Schmid."}
