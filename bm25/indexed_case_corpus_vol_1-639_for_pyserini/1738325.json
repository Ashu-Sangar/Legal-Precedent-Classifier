{"id": "1738325", "contents": "OPINION\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nAppellant, Tyrone W. Finley, was convicted by a jury of murder in the third degree, burglary, and criminal conspiracy. Post-verdict motions were denied, and a sentence of ten to twenty years imprisonment for the murder conviction was imposed, with a consecutive five to ten year sentence for the burglary conviction, and a concurrent five to ten year sentence for the conspiracy conviction. The judgment of sentence for murder was appealed directly to us, and the judgments of sentence for burglary and conspiracy were appealed to the Superior Court and transferred here.\nAt trial, after the prosecution had rested its case, appellant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was denied. Appellant presented no evidence. In post-verdict motions, and again in this appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict.\nA motion for a directed verdict should be granted if the prosecution\u2019s evidence, and all inferences arising therefrom, considered in the light most favorable to the prosecution are insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of the crimes charged. Commonwealth v. Boone, 467 Pa. 168, 354 A.2d 898 (1975); Commonwealth v. Fostar, 455 Pa. 216, 317 A.2d 188 (1974); Commonwealth v. Pride, 450 Pa. 557, 301 A.2d 582 (1973).\nThe prosecution contends that the evidence and the inferences arising therefrom in this case prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant conspired with others to kill and rob one Melvin Clark at his house. It is clear that the appellant did not enter Clark\u2019s house, and was not physically present inside the house when the killing and robbery occurred. The prosecution\u2019s case therefore was based on the theory that appellant remained outside the house to act as a lookout and as driver of the getaway car.\nThere is no doubt that one who acts as lookout and driver of a getaway car is as guilty as those who carry out the planned crimes. Commonwealth v. Coyle, 415 Pa. 379, 203 A.2d 782 (1964). The evidence, however, must be sufficient to establish that appellant had knowledge of the planned crimes and aided and abetted the commission of the crimes.\nIn this case appellant does not dispute that the evidence is sufficient to establish that he was in a car parked near the Clark\u2019s house during the time that he was killed and robbed. Appellant contends, however, that the evidence fails to establish that he had any knowledge of the planned crimes or that he was acting as a lookout or serving as the driver of the getaway car.\nThe prosecution presented the testimony of five witnesses. Four of these witnesses gave no testimony whatsoever which would tend to prove appellant\u2019s, guilt. One of these witnesses was a police officer who arrived at the scene of the robbery-homicide after the participants in the crime had already left. Another of these witnesses was the victim\u2019s father, whose testimony was limited to identifying the victim. Another prosecution witness was a doctor employed by the medical examiner\u2019s office, who conducted the post mortem examination of the victim. This witness\u2019s testimony established only that the victim died of gunshot wounds. A fourth witness for the prosecution was a woman who lived with the victim and was present in the victim\u2019s home at the time the robbery-homicide took place. She was unable to identify any of the persons who were in the house, and gave no testimony implicating appellant.\nThe prosecution also presented the testimony of one Garfield Hedgeman, who was at the scene of the crimes when they occurred. The case against the appellant rests solely on Hedgeman\u2019s testimony.\nThe prosecution\u2019s brief presented its summary of the evidence as follows:\n\u201c[Defendant, accompanied by his mother, Dorothy Finley and a third party (Skeets) drove his automobile to the home of Melvin Clark, at 912 W. Silver Street and parked outside on the street. There they waited until one Garfield Hedgeman approached the victim\u2019s home. Skeets then left the car and gained entrance to Clark\u2019s home by following Hedgeman inside. Once inside Hedgeman attempted to buy drugs from Melvin Clark but learned that he was five dollars short. Skeets, who was not previously known to Hedgeman, then volunteered that Dorothy Finley would lend him five dollars. Skeets and Hedgeman then went to the waiting car which contained defendant, seated behind the wheel, and Dorothy Finley, his mother. Hedgeman, Skeets, and Dorothy Finley then returned to Clark\u2019s home while defendant remained in the car.\n\u201cImmediately after entering Clark\u2019s residence, Skeets shot Melvin Clark, and Hedgeman and Dorothy Finley chased after Clark\u2019s girlfriend Bernadette Durant, and her infant son, preventing them from fleeing through the kitchen door. Ms. Durant then ran upstairs and was pursued by both Hedgeman and Dorothy Finley. Hedge-man attempted to tie Ms. Durant up and tried to strangle her. Ms. Durant fled to a bedroom and secured it by pushing a chest of drawers against the door. Both Hedge-man and Dorothy Finley then searched the upstairs for narcotics. They then ran out of the house, passing Skeets and hearing two more shots on their way out. Skeets then followed and they all ran to the waiting car where defendant had started the car (or \u2018was getting ready to start up the car\u2019). Dorothy Finley and Skeets got in; Hedgeman was given some narcotics but prevented from getting in; and the car sped away.\u201d (We could find no other name in the record for \u201cSkeets\u201d).\nIf the testimony of Hedgeman and the reasonable inferences arising therefrom supported the above summary from the prosecution\u2019s brief, we would conclude that the evidence was sufficient to establish appellant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution\u2019s summary, however, contains factual conclusions which are not supported either by the evidence or by any inferences drawn from the evidence.\nThe prosecution contends that appellant parked on the street and waited until Hedgeman approached the victim\u2019s home, and that when Hedgeman approached, \u201cSkeets\u201d left the car, intending to gain entrance to the victim\u2019s home by following Hedgeman inside. There is no evidence, however, that the car waited outside the victim\u2019s home for anyone. Hedgeman testified that as he approached the victim\u2019s home he saw a car parked nearby, from which \u201cSkeets\u201d exited and began walking behind Hedgeman toward the victim\u2019s home. Hedgeman\u2019s testimony was that although he noticed that the car across the street looked like one owned by his friend, Dot Finley, he walked on toward the victim\u2019s home for the purpose of purchasing narcotics and paid little attention to the car until he heard a car door close, at which time he noticed \u201cSkeets\u201d walking behind him. There is no evidence from which an inference can be drawn that the car was waiting for Hedgeman. There was no evidence as to how long the car had been there. It is sheer speculation to conclude that the car had been there for any length of time. So far as the evidence is concerned, the car could have arrived immediately before Hedgeman did.\nThus, the prosecution\u2019s ultimate conclusion in its summary that the car was waiting outside the victim\u2019s home for Hedgeman to arrive has no support in the evidence. That ultimate conclusion is obviously important to the prosecution because, had the car been waiting for any unusual period of time, it could be inferred that the occupants of the car \u2014 appellant, his mother, and \u201cSkeets\u201d \u2014 had a common purpose in waiting. Without the evidence that the car was waiting, the prosecution\u2019s theory is significantly weakened at its inception.\nThe prosecution\u2019s summary also draws the ultimate conclusion that \u201cSkeets\u201d was able to gain entrance to the victim\u2019s home only by following Hedgeman into the home. Yet there is nothing in the evidence to indicate anything more than that appellant\u2019s car and Hedgeman arrived on the scene at about the same time; and there is nothing to show that the fact that Hedgeman\u2019s approach to the victim\u2019s home occurred almost simultaneously with \u201cSkeets\u2019s\u201d exit from the car and his approach to the victim\u2019s home was anything more than coincidence.\nWhen the victim opened the door and admitted Hedgeman and \u201cSkeets\u201d the first time, there is no evidence to indicate that the victim considered \u201cSkeets\u201d a stranger or an intruder. According to Hedgeman, he immediately began discussing a narcotics transaction with the victim while \u201cSkeets\u201d was present. There is no indication that the victim hesitated or was reluctant to discuss the narcotics transaction with \u201cSkeets\u201d present. There is no evidence as to whether \u201cSkeets\u201d was known or unknown to the victim. Under these circumstances, the prosecution\u2019s theory that appellant\u2019s car was waiting for Hedgeman\u2019s arrival so that \u201cSkeets\u201d could gain entrance to the victim\u2019s home by following Hedgeman is sheer speculation. When the victim told Hedgeman that he was short $5.00 for the purchase and Hedgeman returned with \u201cSkeets\u201d to the car to borrow $5.00 from appellant\u2019s mother, there was no evidence that any conversation occurred in the presence of the appellant except that concerning Hedgeman\u2019s need for a loan of $5.00 to complete the narcotics purchase. When ppellant\u2019s mother left the car and returned with Hedgeman and \u201cSkeets\u201d to the victim\u2019s home, there is no evidence that appellant had any knowledge of what would later occur inside the home.\nThe prosecution\u2019s summary also states that after the shooting and the robbery, when the participants returned to the car, appellant was inside, and had started the car (or \u201cwas getting ready to start up the car.\u201d) Hedgeman\u2019s testimony, however, was not that certain. In testifying about what happened when he, \u201cSkeets,\u201d and appellant\u2019s mother got to the car Hedgeman said:\n\u201cQ. What happened when you got to the car?\nA. The car had started up, I believe, or was getting ready to start up. I tried to get in the car. Instead there wasn\u2019t enough room or something to that effect. Somebody gave me drugs and I ran south on Hutchison Street.\nQ. Now, did anybody get in the car?\nA. As far as I know, everybody got in the car.\nQ. Except yourself?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Was Tyrone Finley still in the car when you got back? A. Well, I believe he was driving. I\u2019m not sure.\nQ. He was at the driver\u2019s seat?\nA. I believe so. I didn\u2019t pay \u2014 I\u2019m not sure if he was driving or not.\nQ. When you saw him the first time, he was behind the driver\u2019s seat; is that correct?\nA. Yes.\u201d\nAs can be seen from the above testimony, Hedgeman was not sure that appellant was driving, nor could he say whether the car was running. Even when he testified that the car \u201cwas getting ready to start up,\u201d he did not identify appellant as the individual in the driver\u2019s seat.\nEvidence that appellant was in the automobile with the motor running at the time that his mother, Skeets, and Hedgeman returned to the car would have tended to support the prosecution\u2019s theory that appellant was ready for a getaway. Hedgeman\u2019s testimony on this point, however, was equivocal. He was not sure when the car was started, and he was not sure whether the appellant was the driver.\nThere is no doubt that the prosecution\u2019s version of what occurred can be fitted in to the facts that were established by the evidence. The fit, however, is grounded in guesswork and speculation rather than on inferences arising from established facts.\nA conviction in a criminal case cannot stand if it must depend upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The standard is a demanding one. The proof must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nWe agree with appellant that although the prosecution\u2019s evidence establishes appellant\u2019s presence at the scene of the crime it does not establish more and without more the conviction cannot stand. Presence alone at the scene of a crime is not sufficient. Commonwealth v. Leach, 455 Pa. 448, 317 A.2d 293 (1974); Commonwealth v. Pierce, 437 Pa. 266, 263 A.2d 350 (1970); Commonwealth v. Giovanetti, 341 Pa. 345, 19 A.2d 119 (1941).\nJudgment of Sentence reversed and the appellant is discharged.\nPOMEROY, J., dissents."}
