{"id": "1762393", "contents": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nOn appeal, the appellant raises the following issues:\n(1) whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain his conviction for second degree murder;\n(2) whether the trial judge erred in excluding a potential juror who was adamantly opposed to the death penalty;\n(3) whether the prosecutor committed reversible error by his reference to photograph identification; and\n(4) whether the trial judge erred by not granting a mistrial after the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement that he represented the Commonwealth, as well as the defendant, a member of the Commonwealth.\nWe find that each allegation of error is without merit and affirm the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County."}
