He was a repairman, and when injured was working in the yard of the coal company under a car belonging to it against which a car of the defendant was pushed. The main ground of defense at the trial and the only one that need be noticed was that the deceased was a fellow servant under the provisions of the Act of April 4, 1868, P. L. 58.\nOne test of the application of the Act of 1868 is the nature of the business of the person injured at the time of the injury. \u201cIf it is business connected with the railroad in the sense that it is ordinarily the duty of railroad employees, then while the party is engaged at it the statute treats him as a quasi employee, and puts his rights on the same basis. If, however, the work has no relation to railroad work as such, and is connected with the railroad only by irrelevant and immaterial circumstances of locality, the case is not within the statute at all\u201d: Spisak v.
