{"id": "470683", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County refusing a petition for a citation to show cause why the report of a master, appointed by an auditing judge to assist him in ascertaining the heirs and nest of kin of a decedent, should not be filed with the clerk of the Orphans\u2019 Court and not with the auditing judge. Such an order is clearly interlocutory, from which no appeal lies. See Aman Estate, 356 Pa. 1.\nAppeal quashed."}
