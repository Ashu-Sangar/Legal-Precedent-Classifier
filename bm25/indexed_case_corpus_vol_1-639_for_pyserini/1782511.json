{"id": "1782511", "contents": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nOn November 17, 1973, appellant Anthony Whiting was convicted by a jury of rape, burglary, robbery, assault, extortion and terroristic threats. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five to ten years. On appeal, the Superior Court affirmed. Commonwealth v. Whiting, 278 Pa.Super. 519, 420 A.2d 662 (1980). We granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal and we now reverse.\nAppellant contends that the trial judge committed reversible error during his charge to the jury when he expressed his personal opinion as to the credibility of the complainant and appellant\u2019s alibi witnesses. At the close of the trial, the judge instructed the jury, in pertinent part, as follows:\nIn deciding which conflicting testimony to believe, you should not necessarily be swayed by the number of witnesses on each side. You may find that the testimony of a few witnesses \u2014 just one witness \u2014 is more believable than the opposing testimony of a greater number of witnesses.\nOn the other hand, you should also consider the extent to which conflicting testimony is supported by other evidence. You should evaluate the testimony of [the complainant] Ida Williams with special care, in view of Ida Williams\u2019 emotional involvement and the difficulty of determining the truth with respect to the crime charged, which is one that is usually carried out in private.\nYou can determine for yourselves what her appearance was. I cannot influence you. I can say that I thought she was a very direct witness who stood up extremely well under circumstances that must have been extremely distressing and painful to her.\nNow, before you find the defendant guilty of the crime charged in this case, you must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the act charged did, in fact, occur and it occurred without Ida Williams consent.\nOne of the factors to be considered in a case of this kind is as to whether a complaint was promptly made to the police. I would say, from the facts as I have heard them, Ida Williams proceeded with all commendable and due haste to immediately go to her daughter for assistance and immediately report what had occurred to her, immediately to the police.\nIda Williams testified that she did not see any particular mark or scars on the defendant. One of the witnesses for the defense stated that at the time of the lineup there was blood coming out of the corner of the mouth of the defendant at the time and that somehow the inference would be that because blood was coming out of his mouth that an inference that you may draw \u2014 that is entirely up to you \u2014 that that somehow identified him as the person and it was upon that that Ida Williams made her identification.\nNow, in my opinion, that is just not consistent She said she did not see any scars or any identification on him at all at the line-up or any other time. But that\u2019s for you to determine.\nAfter you have considered everything, what it all comes down to is to use your common sense as to what did happen in this housing project and did this person who, in my opinion, Ida Williams has testified fairly and truthfully \u2014 was this person really \u2014 did she make a proper identification of this defendant, who has been charged and is on trial before you. And you have to do that by considering the way all the witnesses in this case impressed you.\nNow, don\u2019t be misled by the \u2014 where obviously two sets of friends and former friends of this defendant that are \u2014 whose opinion may or may not be reliable as to where he was. Do not be impressed by the fact that all of the witnesses testified \u2014 the alibi witnesses testified that between the hours of \u2014 I think four or five witnesses said that on June 14th of this year, that Momma\u2019s birthday party, between the hours of noon time and 9:00 P.M. all the people stayed in the house and nobody ever left the house.\nThe only impression \u2014 you can decide whether that impresses you \u2014 but that kind of consistency, in my opinion, is quite suspect. I don\u2019t \u2014 I think it\u2019s impossible that four people would stay in a house on a summer day, apparently, and nobody left the house. I mean, it\u2019s that sort of determined consistency that would, in my opinion, raise some question as to all of the testimony of the people\u2014 that those witnesses have given. But that is for you to determine. You may be impressed by it. It\u2019s for you to determine.\n(Emphasis supplied.)\nAlthough this Court has recognized the duty of the trial court to aid the jury in understanding and clarifying the issues to be resolved, the court\u2019s charge should be a calm and dispassionate one.... The jury depends on the trial court for guidance and it will give great weight to any expressions of the court\u2019s personal opinion. ... To preserve a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, the trial court must be careful to remain absolutely impartial, and not to invade the province of the jury.\nCommonwealth v. Whitfield, 474 Pa. 27, 34-35, 376 A.2d 617, 621 (1977). See also Commonwealth v. Archambault, 448 Pa. 90, 290 A.2d 72 (1972); ABA Standards for Criminal Justice 15-3.8(a) (1980) (\u201cThe trial judge should not express or otherwise indicate to the jury his or her personal opinion whether the defendant is guilty or express an opinion that certain testimony is worthy or unworthy of belief.\u201d).\nIn this case, the trial judge did not simply instruct the jury on the law, nor did he simply review the testimony for the jury. Rather, he offered his opinion to the jury that the complainant was a truthful witness, and that the version of events to which appellant\u2019s alibi witnesses testified was highly improbable. Such partiality on the part of the trial judge is impermissible.\nWe recognize that \u201c[ejrror cannot be predicated on isolated excerpts of the charge. It is the general effect of the charge that controls.\u201d Commonwealth v. Woodward, 483 Pa. 1, 4, 394 A.2d 508, 510 (1978). Nevertheless, we have concluded that the impact of the opinions offered by the trial judge in this case \u2014 that the complainant was truthful and credible, and that the testimony of appellant\u2019s alibi witnesses was highly suspect \u2014 far outweighed the impact of any general instructions given by the trial judge informing the jury that it was responsible for the resolution of all factual conflicts and determinations as to the credibility of witnesses. See Arehambault, supra, 448 Pa. at 96, 290 A.2d at 75 (cautionary instructions that the jury is the final arbiter of the verdict are insufficient to vitiate the impact of the judge\u2019s opinionated statements).\nThe trial judge\u2019s opinionated commentary in this case invaded the province of the jury and denied appellant his right to a fair trial. Accordingly, the order of the Superior Court is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.\nMcDERMOTT, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nBecause of our resolution of this issue, we need not consider the remaining issues raised by appellant, namely: 1) that appellant was denied a fair trial because of the trial judge\u2019s erroneous evidentiary rulings; and 2) that the trial judge erred in not granting a mistrial after the Commonwealth elicited testimony concerning appellant\u2019s-silence at the time of his arrest."}
