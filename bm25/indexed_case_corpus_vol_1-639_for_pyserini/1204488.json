{"id": "1204488", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThese are two applications for leave to appeal from an order of the' Superior Court quashing the appeals on the ground that they were not taken within three months of the entry of the final judgments entered in the Common Pleas.\nThe judgments entered January 10, 1940, for want of sufficient replication, were final judgments at law. The orders of January 26, 1940, allowing reargument before tbe court in banc on exceptions to the entry of the judgments did not open them or otherwise result in extending the time for appeal fixed by statute. See Barlott v. Forney, 187 Pa. 301, 41 A. 47; Bache v. Locke, 86 Pa. Superior Ct. 501; Miller v. Mt. Lebanon Twp., 309 Pa. 221, 163 A. 511. Compare Commonwealth v. Emerson Custis Co., 139 Pa. Superior Ct. 22, and cases cited p. 25 et seq., 10 A. 2d 850; Slagle\u2019s Estate, 335 Pa. 552, 7 A. 2d 353.\n.. The . practice in such actions at law is. not to be confused with procedure in equity (Rule 71) or to remove a nonsuit (Act of March 11, 1875, P. L. 6, 12 PS \u00a7 645; Fine v. Soifer, 288 Pa. 164, 135 A. 742) or in. the Orphans\u2019 Court in counties not haying a separate Orphans\u2019 Court; compare Com. v. Linderman\u2019s Estate; 340 Pa. 289.\nPetitions dismissed."}
