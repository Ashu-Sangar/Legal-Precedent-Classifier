{"id": "840386", "contents": "Per Curiam.\nThis was an appeal from the decree of the distribution of a fund in the hands of a sheriff, raised on two writs of alias fieri facias. A motion to quash the appeal was filed by the appellee, but as an examination of the case fails to disclose error in the distribution, the motion to quash the appeal need not be considered.\nThe decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
