{"id": "1028184", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, January 16th 1872, by\nSharswood, J.\nIt is certainly important that the true construction of the Act of Assembly of April 6th 1859 (Pamph. L. 3 87) should be settled. It provides for the service of process in' certain cases' in \u2022 equity, upon defendants not resident or found within the jurisdiction of the court. Upon the broad interpretation of the act here contended for, defendants not within the jurisdiction of the court can be served wif\u00abh process, and of course be bound by the decree within the Commonwealth in all cases of equity cognisance. If such a construction does not impinge on the Constitution it certainly violates one of the first principles of law \u2014 which denies effect to a judgment when neither the parties nor the subject-matter are within the jurisdiction of the court. To such a judgment, sentence or decree no extra-territorial effect is accorded. As this must be conceded to be so \u2014 and there is neither person nor thing within the jurisdiction on which it can be' enforced \u2014 it must be without legitimate end or purpose. Such a proceeding, after a long sleep, may wake up against some person or thing accidentally brought within its reach, and upon which it may suddenly and unexpectedly pounce. But surely no such design is to.be imputed to the legislature. We are required by every sound canon to give such a construction to the statute as is reasonable and conforms to the general rules and principles of the law. The act provides that it shall be lawful for any court of this Commonwealth having equity jurisdiction in any suit in equity \u201c concerning goods, chattels, lands, tenements or hereditaments, or for the perpetuating of testimony concerning any lands, tenements, and so forth, situate or being within the jurisdiction of such' court,\u201d to order and direct that any subpoena, subpoenas or other process to be had in such suit be served upon any defendant or defendants therein, then residing or being out of the jurisdiction of such court wherever he, she or they may reside or be found. It is contended that the clause \u201c concerning goods, chattels, lands, tenements or hereditaments\u201d is without limitation, and that the words \u201csituate or being within the jurisdiction of such court\u201d apply only to the latter part of the sentence, \u201c for the perpetuating of testimony concerning any lands, tenements, and so forth.\u201d We think, however, that it is very clear that \u201c the goods, chattels, lands, tenements or hereditaments\u201d spoken of in the clause were intended otily to be such \u201c as are situate or being within the jurisdiction of such court.\u201d This is further evident by the provision following, \u201c or concerning any charge, lien, judgment, mortgage or encumbrance thereon,\u201d that is, on lands or tenements situate or being within the jurisdiction of such court. If the first clause is to have the effect claimed for it, it would include the two which follow, and render the limitation on the power in those special cases ineffectual \u2014 for, if the court are to have the power in all cases \u201c concerning goods, chattels, lands, tenements or hereditaments,\u201d surely eases \u201c for the perpetuating of testimony concerning lands, tenements, and so forth,\u201d or \u201c concerning any charge, lien, judgment, mortgage or encumbrance thereon,\u201d fall within the comprehensive words \u201c concerning goods, chattels, lands, tenements or hereditaments.\u201d If we read further, we shall find the legislature still careful to preserve this feature of the law \u2014 that the court shall have jurisdiction of the subject-matter, for it goes on to provide that the act shall extend to cases \u201cwhere the court have acquired jurisdiction of the subject-matter in controversy by the service of its process on one or more of the principal defendants.\u201d This limitation is equally ineffectual, if the power of the court embraces all cases \u201c concerning goods, chattels, lands, tenements or hereditaments.\u201d To save this legislation, then, from being unreasonable if not senseless and absurd, we must hold that to authorize a court having equity jurisdiction, to exercise the power conferred by this act, the subject-matter of the suit must either be itself within the jurisdiction of the court, or must be brought within its jurisdiction by the service of its process on one or more of the principal' defendants.\nThe act in question is entitled \u201c An act to authorize execution of process in certain cases in equity concerning property within the jurisdiction of the court and on defendants not resident or found therein.\u201d However it was in England, where the title was held to be no part of a statute, indeed was commonly framed by the clerk of Parliament after the bill had passed, without any vote being taken upon it, certainly since the first amendment of the Constitution adopted in 1864, \u2014 Art. XI. sect. 8 \u2014 it is now necessarily a part of the act, and a very important guide to its right construction. It will be seen by the title the act relates to cases in equity \u201c concerning property within the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d The other clause \u201c and on defendants not resident or found therein,\u201d evidently refers to that other part of the act, \u201cwhen the court have acquired jurisdiction of the subject-matter in controversy by the service of its process on one or more of the principal defendants.\u201d\nIn this case there was but one defendant, and he not resident or found within the jurisdiction. The subject-matter of the suit was| certain lands in Elk county, Pennsylvania, not within the original jurisdiction of this court sitting in equity in Philadelphia, nor of course within the jurisdiction of the Court of Nisi Prius. The defendant is charged in the bill as the trustee of five tracts, four of which he had sold. Whether the title remained in Cowan or had been sold by him clear of the trust, neither the land nor its proceeds were subjects within the jurisdiction of the court. It follows that the motion to vacate the order for special service and set aside the service of the bill was properly granted.\nOrder affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
