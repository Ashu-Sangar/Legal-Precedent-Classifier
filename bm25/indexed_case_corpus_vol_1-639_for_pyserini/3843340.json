{"id": "3843340", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nAppellant appeals from the order denying him relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. We affirm.\nAppellant was convicted of the first degree murder of David Bolasky, who was lured to Miguel Moreno\u2019s apartment in Allentown under the pretense Moreno intended to pay him rent money. Bolasky was attacked and killed inside the apartment by appellant, George Lopez, and Jorge Barbosa. Moreno was not present during the killing, but implicated himself, Lopez, Barbosa, and appellant when he confessed to the police.\nBarbosa confessed to Captain Anthony Bucarey and implicated appellant, Lopez, and Moreno. Barbosa stated he struck Bolasky on the head with a pistol, and he, appellant, and Lopez took turns tightening a towel around Bolasky\u2019s neck until he was dead. Bolasky\u2019s body was hog-tied, wrapped in bed sheets, carried out of the apartment building, and loaded into Bolasky\u2019s van. Appellant, Lopez, and Barbosa drove to a desolate area, dumped the body, and abandoned the van. Bolasky\u2019s hog-tied body was subsequently found wrapped in bed sheets along a secluded road. Barbosa pled guilty and received a life sentence.\nAppellant and Lopez were tried jointly. During the guilt phase, Barbosa testified about the involvement of Lopez and Moreno in the killing, but refused to answer questions regarding appellant\u2019s involvement. Despite being held in contempt of court, Barbosa refused to answer questions regarding his prior statements as they related to appellant. The trial court permitted Captain Bucarey to read Barbosa\u2019s transcribed statement from the tape-recorded police interview which explicitly implicated appellant in the murder. Moreno also testified, implicating appellant in the crime. Appellant\u2019s cellmate, Daniel Lopez, testified appellant admitted to him the facts of his involvement in the robbery and murder.\nThe jury found appellant guilty of first degree murder and returned a verdict of death after finding four aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances. On direct appeal, this Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. Commonwealth v. Romero, 555 Pa. 4, 722 A.2d 1014 (1999). The United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. Romero v. Pennsylvania, 528 U.S. 952, 120 S.Ct. 376, 145 L.Ed.2d 293 (1999). On October 25, 1999, appellant filed a pro se PCRA petition and received appointed counsel, who filed an amended petition. Following a hearing, the PCRA court denied appellant\u2019s petition. Appellant now appeals, raising 25 issues for our review.\nIn reviewing an order granting or denying post conviction relief, we examine whether the PCRA court\u2019s determination is supported by the evidence and whether it is free of legal error. Commonwealth v. Williams, 557 Pa. 207, 732 A.2d 1167, 1176 (1999). To be entitled to relief under the PCRA, appellant must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the enumerated errors or defects found in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2), his claims have not been previously litigated or waived, id., \u00a7 9543(a)(3), and \u201cthe failure to litigate the issue prior to or during trial, during unitary review or on direct appeal could not have been the result of any rational, strategic or tactical decision by counsel.\u201d Id., \u00a7 9543(a)(4). An issue is previously litigated if \u201cthe highest appellate court in which the petitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue....\u201d Id., \u00a7 9544(a)(2).\nSeveral of the issues underlying appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claims were addressed on direct appeal; specifically, we addressed the admission of Barbosa\u2019s prior police statement and noted there was sufficient evidence to support the aggravating circumstances. Romero, at 1016-19, 1021 n. 8. However, appellant now alleges counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in connection with these issues; therefore, his issues are distinct from those raised on direct appeal and have not been previously litigated. See Commonwealth v. Collins, 585 Pa. 45, 888 A.2d 564, 570, 573 (2005) (term \u201cissue\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 9543(a)(3) and 9544(a)(2) \u201crefers to the discrete legal ground that was forwarded on direct appeal and would have entitled the defendant to relief ....\u201d; ineffectiveness claims are distinct from claims raised on direct appeal, and must be treated as wholly independent of underlying claim of error).\nRegarding waiver, we note none of appellant\u2019s issues were raised at trial or on direct appeal; thus, the underlying claims of trial error were waived. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b). However, appellant may still obtain relief if he can show appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue the claims of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. See Commonwealth v. Rush, 576 Pa. 3, 838 A.2d 651, 656 (2003) (citing Commonwealth v. McGill, 574 Pa. 574, 832 A.2d 1014, 1022 (2003) (when court is faced with \u201clayered\u201d ineffectiveness claim, only viable ineffectiveness claim is that related to most recent counsel, appellate counsel)).\nTo preserve a \u201clayered\u201d ineffectiveness claim,\na petitioner must \u201cplead, in his PCRA petition,\u201d that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise all prior counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Additionally, a petitioner must \u201cpresent argument on, i.e. develop each prong of the [Commonwealth v.] Pierce [, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (Pa.1987) ] test\u201d as to appellate counsel\u2019s deficient representation.\n\u201cThen, and only then, has the petitioner preserved a layered claim of ineffectiveness for the court to review; then, and only then, can the court proceed to determine whether the petitioner has proved his layered claim.\u201d\nId., at 656 (citations and footnote omitted) (emphasis in original); see also McGill, at 1021-23.\nThe \u201cPierce test\u201d requires appellant to prove, with respect to appellate counsel\u2019s performance, that: (1) the underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness has arguable merit; (2) appellate counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to pursue the claim; and (3) but for appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, the result on direct appeal would have differed. See McGill, at 1022-23. This \u201cperformance and prejudice\u201d test was first enunciated in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and was recognized in Pierce as the proper test under the Pennsylvania Constitution. Failure to establish any prong of the test will defeat an ineffectiveness claim. Commonwealth v. Basemore, 560 Pa. 258, 744 A.2d 717, 738 n. 23 (2000) (citing Commonwealth v. Rollins, 558 Pa. 532, 738 A.2d 435, 441 (1999) (ordinarily, post conviction claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may be denied by showing petitioner\u2019s evidence fails to meet any one of three prongs for claim)).\nAppellant has met the pleading requirement. In his PCRA petition, he properly pled appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for not raising trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to challenge the alleged errors at trial. See Commonwealth v. Chmiel, 536 Pa. 244, 639 A.2d 9, 12 (1994) (ineffectiveness claim must be raised at earliest stage at which counsel whose stewardship is being challenged no longer represents appellant). In his brief, appellant discusses trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness and includes a sentence concerning appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in connection with each issue; he attempts to overcome waiver with a catch-all, boilerplate assertion of all prior counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to litigate these issues. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 3, 99-100. He also presents argument concerning his underlying claims of trial error and trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, satisfying the first prong of Pierce with respect to appellate counsel. However, he fails to develop the remaining two prongs concerning appellate counsel\u2019s stewardship; thus, he has failed to preserve his claims of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness as required by McGill.\nIn cases where the appellant has established the arguable merit of his underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, thus establishing the first prong of Pierce with respect to appellate counsel, remand may be warranted for the opportunity to develop the remaining two prongs regarding appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Rush, at 657. \u201cNevertheless, there is simply no need to remand a PCRA petition when the petitioner has not carried his Pierce burden in relation to the underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, since even if the petitioner were able to craft a perfectly layered argument in support of his claim, the petitioner\u2019s claim would not entitle him to relief.\u201d Id., at 657-58. Thus, we need not remand if appellant has not met his burden of proving the underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\nAs discussed below, appellant has not demonstrated his entitlement to relief on any of these underlying claims. Since all of appellant\u2019s underlying claims of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness fail, his claims of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness are necessarily defeated as well. McGill, at 1028. Therefore, we need not remand in order for him to develop the remaining two prongs of Pierce with respect to appellate counsel. See Rush, at 657-58; McGill, at 1026. We now turn to address appellant\u2019s claims.\nWhether appellant\u2019s conviction must be reversed because the trial was not commenced within the time constraints of the interstate agreement on detainers.\nAppellant argues the charges against him should have been dismissed because he was not tried within 120 days of his arrival in Pennsylvania from Puerto Rico, as required by the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9101, art. IY(c). Appellant was sentenced to imprisonment in Puerto Rico for an unrelated offense two months after Bolasky\u2019s murder and brought to Pennsylvania two months later to face the instant charges; however, his trial did not commence until 250 days after his arrival. He claims this delay prejudiced him because much of the evidence used to procure his conviction was obtained after the 120-day period.\nAt appellant\u2019s PCRA hearing, trial counsel testified appellant was not brought to Pennsylvania under the IAD; the Commonwealth attempted to get a detainer for him under the IAD but was informed by the Governor\u2019s Office that it could not proceed under the IAD because appellant was in Puerto Rico. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/81/00, at 766. Instead, the Commonwealth brought appellant to Pennsylvania pursuant to an executive agreement signed by the Governors of Pennsylvania and Puerto Rico. Id., at 766-67. Once appellant was in Pennsylvania, the trial schedule was established by consensus between the Commonwealth and counsel for the defendants. Id., at 681-82. Trial counsel testified he did not challenge the time in which appellant was brought to trial because he felt it would be disingenuous to argue the time limits had run when he originally agreed to the schedule. Id. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness fails, and remand is unnecessary for development of his claim of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether appellant was denied his right to a fair trial where all proceedings were conducted in English, which appellant was tmable to meaningfully understand, and without translation by an interpreter.\nAppellant claims he was denied a fair trial because trial was conducted in English and, as a native Spanish-speaker, he was not provided an interpreter when he \u201cwas unable to meaningfully speak, read or understand the English language.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 15. This Court has stated:\nA defendant\u2019s ability to use an interpreter encompasses numerous fundamental rights. The failure to understand the proceedings may deny him his right to confront witnesses against him, his right to consult with his attorney, or his right to be present at his own trial. The use of an interpreter may also be necessary to protect appellant\u2019s right to testify in his own behalf.\n* * *\nThe decision to use an interpreter rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge. This is necessary because numerous factors such as the complexity of issues and testimony and the language ability of the defendant must be taken into consideration. However, in view of the important rights involved, the trial court must consider all relevant factors in its initial determination of need. If it becomes apparent that an interpreter is necessary during the trial, the court should, on its own motion or on motion of a party, make an interpreter available.\nCommonwealth v. Pana, 469 Pa. 43, 364 A.2d 895, 898 (1976) (citations omitted).\nTrial counsel testified although he had an interpreter present during his first meeting with appellant, it was clear to him appellant understood enough English to communicate with counsel; if there was a word or phrase appellant did not understand, counsel would explain it in simpler terms. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 639-42, 684-85. Counsel further testified he and appellant discussed having an interpreter at trial, but he thought it might create a racial bias against appellant, as there was some racial animus against Hispanics in the community; he feared if appellant spoke in Spanish at times and in English at others, the jury would eye this with suspicion. Id., at 642-43. Counsel advised appellant if there ever came a point in trial that he felt he needed an interpreter, one would be provided, but counsel felt, based on his conversations with appellant, that appellant would be able to proceed without one. Id., at 643-44.\nThis testimony was corroborated by Detective Joseph Hanna, who testified although he initially was under the impression appellant did not speak English well, appellant initiated and sustained two conversations with him in English. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/1/00, at 939-48. Finally, appellate counsel testified his review of the transcript did not lead him to believe appellant had expressed he did not understand the proceedings, and therefore he had not raised the issue. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 738. The PCRA court found all of this testimony credible, and concluded at the time of trial, appellant was able to communicate in English and comprehend the proceedings in English. See Commonwealth v. Carson, 559 Pa. 460, 741 A.2d 686, 693 (1999) (credibility issues solely within province of fact-finder). Accordingly, appellant\u2019s underlying claim fails, and there is no need to remand for development of the remaining two prongs concerning appellate counsel. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether the trial court failed to take protective measures to combat the sustained, pervasive, and inflammatory pre-trial and trial publicity.\nAppellant claims the trial court and counsel failed to take appropriate measures to combat inflammatory publicity about his case, both pre-trial and during trial. He argues it was impossible to empanel an impartial jury because of the extensive newspaper articles, as well as radio and television coverage, which continually emphasized his dangerousness and criminal history, as well as presented facts about the victim that would have been inadmissible at trial. Appellant points out that 76 of the 110 venire members stated they knew about the case from the media, and 11 of the 12 jurors empaneled, as well as three of the four alternates, were familiar with the case. Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 85-86. He contends the trial court\u2019s instructions to the venire members during voir dire were insufficient to protect his right to an impartial jury, and its questioning of them was superficial and inconsistent; therefore, counsel should have demanded a change of venue or venire, and the trial court should have moved the trial or sequestered the jury.\nAppellant argues the media publicity was presumptively prejudicial. However, \u201c[t]he mere existence of pretrial publicity does not warrant a presumption of prejudice.\u201d Commonwealth v. Chambers, 546 Pa. 370, 685 A.2d 96, 103 (1996). This Court noted, in determining whether pre-trial publicity was inherently prejudicial:\n[O]ur inquiry must focus upon whether any juror formed a fixed opinion of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence as a result of the pre-trial publicity. Pre-trial publicity will be deemed inherently prejudicial where the publicity is sensational, inflammatory, slanted towards conviction rather than factual and objective; revealed that the accused had a criminal record; referred to confessions, admissions or reenactments of the crime by the accused; or derived from reports from the police and prosecuting officers.\nCommonwealth v. Marinelli, 547 Pa. 294, 690 A.2d 203, 213 (1997) (quoting Commonwealth v. Paolello, 542 Pa. 47, 665 A.2d 439, 450 (1995)).\nIf any of these factors exists, the publicity is deemed to be inherently prejudicial, and we must inquire whether the publicity has been so extensive, so sustained, and so pervasive that the community must be deemed to have been saturated with it. Finally, even if there has been inherently prejudicial publicity which has saturated the community, no change of venue is warranted if the passage of time has significantly dissipated the prejudicial effects of the publicity-\nChambers, at 103 (citations omitted).\nThe record reveals all 12 jurors selected for appellant\u2019s trial were asked about their knowledge of the case from the media; of those who were familiar with it, none had formed a fixed opinion of appellant\u2019s guilt or innocence. See N.T. Voir Dire, 3/4/96, at 141, 260; N.T. Voir Dire, 3/5/96, at 16, 21, 58, 117-19, 127-31, 258-59, 346, 355, 415-16, 423-26; N.T. Voir Dire, 3/6/96, at 101-02, 107, 108-09, 195-96, 246-47, 400-01. Thus, appellant was not denied his right to an impartial jury, and remand is unnecessary for him to develop his claim of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether appellant\u2019s venire, and hence his petit jury, was not representative of a fair cross-section of the community.\nAppellant contends his jury was not selected from a fair cross-section of the community; he claims Lehigh County\u2019s jury selection procedures resulted in the exclusion of Hispanic and African-American jurors from the venire. To establish a prima facie case that a jury pool selection method violates the Sixth Amendment, appellant must show:\n1) the group allegedly excluded is a distinctive group in the community; 2) representation of this group in the pool from which juries are selected is unfair and unreasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and 3) the under-representation is due to the systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process.\nCommonwealth v. Lopez, 559 Pa. 131, 739 A.2d 485, 495 (1999) (citing Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357, 364, 99 S.Ct. 664, 58 L.Ed.2d 579 (1979)).\nAt the PCRA hearing, trial counsel testified he did \u201cnot really\u201d recall the jury selection proceedings, N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 611, but that to his knowledge, there were no jury members with Hispanic names on appellant\u2019s jury, nor were there any African-Americans. Id. He recalled \u201cmaybe one or two\u201d African-Americans in a jury pool of approximately 100. Id., at 611-12. He stated the Hispanic population in Allentown is approximately 6% of 100,000-110,000, id., at 612, 618, so he would have expected a larger percentage of Hispanics on the panel. Id., at 618. However, he was unable to give statistics regarding the Hispanic and African-American population of Lehigh County as a whole, from which the jury pool was selected.\nThe prosecutor testified regarding Lehigh County\u2019s jury selection process; PennDOT sends the county a list of all licensed drivers residing in the county, and a computer randomly selects names from the list. Id., at 776. There is no way for the system to include or exclude venire persons based on race or gender. Id., at 776-77.\nIn Lopez, appellant\u2019s co-defendant raised a similar challenge on direct appeal, claiming the jury selection process systematically excluded the elderly, the poor, and the handicapped. Lopez, at 494. This Court concluded Lopez failed to offer statistical proof these classes were under-represented in Le-high County\u2019s selection process. Id., at 495. Likewise, appellant failed to offer statistical evidence regarding Lehigh County\u2019s racial composition. Furthermore, as observed in Lopez, Lehigh County\u2019s selection method provided a greater number of prospective jurors than were contained in the county\u2019s voter registration list, which is listed as an acceptable means of selection in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4521(a)(2). Lopez, at 494 n. 13. Thus, Lehigh County\u2019s method of jury selection is statutorily permissible, and appellant has failed to demonstrate a violation of his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury. Accordingly, remand is unnecessary for further development of this claim. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether appellant was unconstitutionally tried while incompetent.\nAppellant claims he was tried while incompetent. He argues the testimony of two experts who testified at the PCRA hearing established he is borderline mentally retarded, brain damaged, and mentally ill; he claims these factors, combined with the fact he was not provided an interpreter and was forced to wear a stun belt during trial, rendered him incompetent.\nPursuant to 50 P.S. \u00a7 7402(a), a person is incompetent to stand trial when he is substantially unable to understand the nature or object of the proceedings against him or to participate in his own defense. As previously discussed, appellant\u2019s claim concerning the lack of an interpreter is meritless; his claim concerning the stun belt is also meritless, as discussed infra. Thus, we turn to the expert testimony at the PCRA hearing, as it is the only evidence which may support appellant\u2019s claim.\nAppellant presented the testimony of two experts; the Commonwealth presented one expert. Although all of the experts testified extensively concerning appellant\u2019s capacity to form specific intent, his low level of intelligence, and whether he had organic brain syndrome, none of them testified that any mental deficiency possessed by appellant would have prevented him from understanding what his trial was about or from cooperating with trial counsel. Furthermore, trial counsel testified \u201cthere was never any question in [his] mind that ... [appellant] knew and could participate in his defense.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 660. Thus, appellant\u2019s claim is meritless, and there is no need to remand for development of this claim. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether appellant was improperly forced to wear a stun belt during his trial.\nAppellant claims wearing a stun belt at trial prejudiced him in the jury\u2019s eyes and constituted cruel and unusual punishment. He argues there was no showing of necessity for him to wear the belt, and the Commonwealth failed to show less restrictive means of restraining him were unavailable. He further contends wearing the belt deprived him of his ability to communicate with counsel and placed him \u201cunder significant, unfair and prejudicial psychological pressure,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 94, such that he was unable to participate in his defense. He claims wearing the belt during his testimony at the penalty phase interfered with his right to testify and his right against self-incrimination.\nTrial counsel and the prosecutor both testified the stun belt was not visible to the jury; it was underneath appellant\u2019s clothes. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 665, 768. The jury could not have been prejudiced by what it could not see. Further, there was no testimony presented which would support appellant\u2019s assertion that the belt psychologically hindered him from fully participating in his trial. As this claim lacks merit, remand for further development of it is unnecessary. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether appellant is entitled to relief from his conviction and sentence because he is actually innocent and his conviction and death sentence are the product of false testimony, government misconduct and overreaching, and ineffective assistance of counsel.\nAppellant claims his conviction and death sentence must be overturned because he is innocent and because they were the product of government misconduct, false testimony, and ineffective assistance of counsel. The crux of his argument is that the trial testimony of Barbosa and Moreno, which was the mainstay of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, was coerced by the police and was false, as evidenced by these witnesses\u2019 subsequent recantation at appellant\u2019s PCRA hearing. Appellant further argues trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to discover and present this recantation evidence.\nTo be entitled to a new trial on the basis of recantation evidence, \u201cthe testimony must be such that it could not have been obtained at the time of trial by reasonable diligence; must not be merely corroborative or cumulative; cannot be directed solely to impeachment; and must be such that it would likely compel a different outcome of the trial.\u201d Williams, at 1180 (citing Commonwealth v. McCracken, 540 Pa. 541, 659 A.2d 541, 545 (1995)) (citations omitted).\nThis Court has stated:\nRecantation testimony is extremely unreliable. When the recantation involves an admission of perjury, it is the least reliable form of proof. The trial court has the responsibility of judging the credibility of the recantation. Unless the trial court is satisfied that the recantation is true, it should deny a new trial. An appellate court may not disturb the trial court\u2019s determination absent a clear abuse of discretion.\nCommonwealth v. Henry, 550 Pa. 346, 706 A.2d 313, 321 (1997) (citations omitted).\nAppellant reasserts his version of the \u201cpizza shop story\u201d is true; he claims he was in the pizza shop across the street from the apartment where the murder took place, had no part in the planning or commission of the crime, and is thus innocent. This was the defense theory at trial, and the jury rejected it. At appellant\u2019s PCRA hearing, Barbosa and Moreno recanted their prior testimony implicating appellant, instead adopting their own versions of the pizza shop story in an attempt to exculpate appellant.\nBarbosa testified he did not testify at trial with reference to appellant because he did not want to continue to lie about appellant\u2019s involvement. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/26/00, at 217-18. Barbosa testified appellant was not present during the murder, but rather, stayed behind in a nearby pizzeria where the other men involved had formulated the plan to rob Bola-sky. Id., at 205.\nMoreno, who made statements to the police implicating appellant in the murder, testified his earlier statements were false. Id., at 305, 312. Moreno testified he did not see appellant inside the apartment, but thought he might remember appellant coming down the stairs of the building. Id., at 307-08. Moreno testified he only remembered seeing appellant outside in front of the apartment building after the murder. Id., at 332.\nThe PCRA judge, who also presided at appellant\u2019s trial, did not find the recantation testimony of these witnesses credible:\nBecause I presided at the trial of the Defendant, as well as at the PCRA hearing, I had the opportunity to observe the testimony of Barbosa and Moreno both times. It is my finding that both Barbosa and Moreno were untruthful when giving their recantation testimony at the PCRA hearing. Counsel for the Commonwealth and for the Defendant have outlined the motives, or lack thereof, for Barbosa and Moreno to have lied at the PCRA hearing. Whether the motive to lie came from friendship, from peer pressure, from a desire for status in the prison community, or for some other reason is immaterial to my finding. It was clear from the content of the PCRA testimony as well as its manner of delivery that both individuals lied in order to attempt to save the Defendant from the sentence of death.\nPCRA Court Opinion, 9/15/00, at 3. It is the fact-finder\u2019s function to resolve inconsistencies and conflicts in testimony, Commonwealth v. Smith, 490 Pa. 329, 416 A.2d 494, 496 (1980), and credibility issues are solely within the province of the fact-finder. Carson, at 693. Where a PCRA court\u2019s credibility determination is supported by the record, it is binding on the reviewing court. Commonwealth v. White, 557 Pa. 408, 734 A.2d 374, 381 (1999). The PCRA court, having heard these witnesses\u2019 testimony and observed their demeanor at both trial and the PCRA hearing, concluded their statements implicating appellant were reliable and credible. We find no abuse of discretion by the PCRA court; therefore, we will not disturb its credibility determinations.\nAppellant further claims Barbosa and Moreno\u2019s statements implicating him were the product of police coercion, and the Commonwealth presented this evidence in reckless disregard for its truth or falsity when it did not administer polygraph tests to these witnesses. The statements these witnesses gave, however, were prompted by the polygraph; Moreno gave his statement when faced with the prospect of having to take a polygraph after giving police several versions of his story, and Barbosa gave his statement after he failed the polygraph, having told police the pizza shop story. The only inconsistency in Moreno\u2019s stories was his own level of involvement; with each new version, he confessed to a greater level of complicity. The reason Barbosa gave for his subsequent refusal to testify after he had implicated appellant was he did not want to lie, N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/26/00, at 217-18; however, the PCRA hearing testimony of the police revealed Barbosa and appellant had a prior relationship, having escaped from jail together in Puerto Rico. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/1/00, at 967-68. Barbosa, who was serving life in prison and had nothing to gain by testifying at appellant\u2019s trial, feared retaliation against his family by appellant\u2019s supporters in Puerto Rico. Id., at 965-66. Thus, there is nothing in the record to support appellant\u2019s allegation of government misconduct. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claims fail, as there is no merit to his underlying claims of innocence or government misconduct, and we need not remand for development of his claim concerning appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether the admission of the inadequately redacted statement of appellant\u2019s non-testifying co-defendant, at their joint trial, violated appellant\u2019s constitutional nghts.\nAppellant claims the admission of Lopez\u2019s inadequately redacted statement at their joint trial violated his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights and Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) (non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession that expressly names another co-defendant is inadmissible at joint trial). Lopez did not testify at trial, but appellant\u2019s cellmate testified regarding the contents of a written statement Lopez had shown him. In the statement, Lopez said he and appellant were in a pizza shop when Moreno committed the murder, and Lopez and appellant merely helped dispose of the body. See N.T. Trial Vol. IV, 3/12/96, at 125-27, 150-52. The statement supported the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that appellant and Lopez conspired to fabricate a false inculpatory statement while they were in prison, minimizing their involvement in the crime, see N.T. Trial, 3/19/96, at 92-96; it was introduced first against Lopez, then against appellant. When read against Lopez, appellant\u2019s name was redacted and replaced with \u201cthe other guy\u201d; when read against appellant, Lopez\u2019s name was redacted and replaced with \u201cthe other guy.\u201d Appellant claims the effect of the redaction of his name was vitiated by the subsequent redaction of Lopez\u2019s name; presenting both versions of the statement made it clear the cellmate was referring to appellant and Lopez.\nContrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the pizza shop story Lopez told the cellmate was not introduced for its truth. See N.T. Trial, 3/19/96, at 92 (\u201c[Daniel Lopez] was not testifying that this story is true. He was testifying, \u2018This is what they had me write out for them.... \u2019 He was not saying that that\u2019s true.\u201d). Rather, it was admitted to show appellant and Lopez\u2019s consciousness of guilt, i.e., they would not have fabricated a story to minimize their involvement had they not been guilty. See id., at 96 (\u201cThere\u2019s a reason to remove oneself from criminal responsibility and faults. There\u2019s a reason to fabricate evidence and minimize [their] involvement. And the reason is the same reason we talked about before. Because they\u2019re guilty.\u201d). Thus, the statement was not hearsay. See Pa.R.E. 801 (hearsay is statement offered to prove truth of matter asserted). A defendant\u2019s right to confrontation is not implicated when the prosecution introduces a co-defendant\u2019s incriminating statement for a non-hearsay purpose; the truth of the statement is not implicated. See Lopez, at 506-07 (Saylor, J., concurring) (citing Tennessee v. Street, 471 U.S. 409, 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985) (defendant\u2019s Confrontation Clause rights not violated by introduction of accomplice\u2019s confession for nonhearsay purpose of rebutting defendant\u2019s testimony that his confession was coerced)). As the pizza shop story was not introduced for its truth, it was not hearsay, and appellant\u2019s confrontation rights were not implicated. Therefore, remand for development of this merit-less claim is unnecessary. See McGill, at 1026.\nAppellant further claims reading both versions of Lopez\u2019s statement made it clear another redacted statement by Lopez, read into evidence by a police detective, also referenced appellant. The detective read portions of a February 10, 1995 police interview with Lopez, in which appellant\u2019s name was redacted and replaced with \u201cthe other guy.\u201d See N.T. Trial, 3/18/96, at 186, 189, 193-94, 199, 201-04, 211, 216-20. As with Lopez\u2019s written statement to the cellmate, Lopez\u2019s statements in the police interview were not introduced for their truth; the three interviews showed Lopez\u2019s deviation from his initial version of events in earlier interviews and his inconsistency in relating the \u201cfacts\u201d of the murder to the police. See N.T. Trial, 3/19/96, at 107-10 (prosecutor\u2019s closing statement contrasted Lopez\u2019s different versions of how murder occurred); id., at 110 (\u201cI submit to you, you also know why George Ivan Lopez is lying. Because he\u2019s guilty and he doesn\u2019t want to be found out. George Ivan Lopez\u2019s lies are indications of his guilt.\u201d). Because Lopez\u2019s statements were introduced not for their truth, but rather to show he fabricated the stories because he was guilty, appellant\u2019s confrontation rights were not implicated. This claim is meritless; therefore, remand is unnecessary. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether the Commonwealth improperly introduced irrelevant and inflammatory victim impact evidence.\nAppellant claims the Commonwealth improperly introduced victim impact evidence during the guilt phase when certain witnesses testified regarding the victim\u2019s background and character; appellant claims this evidence, which was inflammatory, also tainted the penalty phase because the jury was never given a curative or limiting instruction.\nEvidence introduced to result in sympathy for the victim\u2019s family, while having no direct relationship to the facts and circumstances of the crime, is impermissible during the guilt phase of trial. See Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 383 A.2d 155, 159 (1978). Contrary to appellant\u2019s claim, the testimony of these witnesses was introduced as evidence establishing a link to the crime. One of the victim\u2019s co-workers testified about a bonus check the victim received on the day of the murder that was never recovered from his belongings, thus supporting the charges of theft, robbery, and receiving stolen property. Another co-worker testified about what the victim was wearing when last seen and described the victim\u2019s briefcase, which matched the description of one later discarded by Barbosa. The witness who found the victim\u2019s discarded wallet, which was crucial in later locating the victim\u2019s body, recounted how she tried to return it, only to learn the victim was dead; she then gave it to police. The police chief testified regarding the missing person investigation and the discovery of the body. The victim\u2019s wife testified about what her husband was wearing when last seen and identified his discarded belongings. All of this testimony was relevant in establishing the chain of events and linking the defendants to the crime. As such, there was no error in admitting it, and remand to develop this claim is unwarranted. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether the jury instructions unconstitutionally relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proving every element of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAppellant argues the jury instructions unconstitutionally relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proving every element of each offense beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial court defined \u201creasonable doubt\u201d as a doubt that \u201cwould cause a reasonably, careful and sensible person, to pause, hesitate or refrain from acting upon a matter of highest importance in his or her own affairs or to his or her own interests.\u201d N.T. Trial, 3/19/96, at 155-56 (emphasis added). Appellant claims the \u201crefrain from acting\u201d formulation requires a higher level of doubt than is required by due process; Pennsylvania Suggested Standard Criminal Jury Instruction 7.01(3) defines a \u201creasonable doubt\u201d as one \u201cthat would cause a reasonably careful and sensible person to hesitate before acting upon a matter of importance in his or her own affairs.\u201d Pa.S.S.J.I. (Crim.) 7.01(3). Appellant also alleges the trial court told the jury Barbosa\u2019s prior inconsistent statement could be regarded as proof of the facts in the statement; he argues this instruction relieved the Commonwealth of its burden and invaded the jury\u2019s fact-finding function. Finally, appellant asserts the accomplice and co-conspirator liability instructions relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proving he possessed specific intent to kill.\nA trial court has broad discretion in phrasing its instructions to the jury and can choose its own wording so long as the law is clearly, adequately and accurately presented to the jury for consideration.... In reviewing a challenged jury instruction, an appellate court must consider the entire charge as a whole, not merely isolated fragments, in order to ascertain whether the instruction fairly conveys the legal principles at issue.\nCommonwealth v. Gibson, 553 Pa. 648, 720 A.2d 473, 481 (1998) (citations omitted).\nAppellant isolates the \u201crefrain from acting\u201d portion of the reasonable doubt charge without reading it in the context of the entire charge; the trial court prefaced this phrase with \u201cpause, hesitate,\u201d and thus did not restrict the definition to only those doubts that would preclude one from acting at all. This Court has approved of similar instructions on reasonable doubt. See Commonwealth v. Murphy, 559 Pa. 71, 739 A.2d 141, 146-47 (1999) (\u201creasonable doubt\u201d is one that would \u201ccause a prudent, careful and sensible person to pause, hesitate, restrain himself or herself before acting upon a matter of the highest importance in his or her affairs\u201d). The language used herein is not a variation that warrants reversal.\nSimilarly, appellant reads a portion of the instruction regarding Barbosa\u2019s prior statement in isolation; the charge, in its entirety, stated: \u201cYou may, if you choose, regard this evidence as proof of anything that the witness said in the earlier statement.\u201d N.T. Trial, 3/19/96, at 166 (emphasis added). Although this Court concluded on direct appeal that Barbosa\u2019s prior statement was erroneously admitted, see Romero, at 1016, the instructions given on it were proper. Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the court did not direct the jury to regard Barbosa\u2019s statement as proof, but rather that the jury could do so if it so chose. The province of the jury was not invaded, nor was the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof diluted.\nAppellant\u2019s claim that the conspirator and accomplice liability instructions negated the requirement the Commonwealth prove he possessed specific intent to kill is also merit-less. A review of the instructions in their entirety reveals the court told the jury \u201ceach [defendant] is entitled to have the question of his guilt determined individually and on the basis of the evidence that is admissible against him\u201d and \u201cthe defendant is not guilty unless he and the others had an agreement or a common understanding and shared the intention to commit these crimes.\u201d N.T. Trial, 3/19/96, at 191, 192 (emphasis added). The court stated, \u201c[A defendant] is an accomplice if with the intent of promotion or facilitating commission of the crime he solicits, commands, encourages or requests the other person to commit it or aides, agrees to aide, or attempts to aide the other person in planning or committing it.\u201d Id., at 184-85 (emphasis added). Thus, the instructions properly reflected the element of specific intent the Commonwealth had to prove. Remand for further development of this claim is unwarranted. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether appellant\u2019s constitutional rights were violated when his penalty phase proceedings were conducted jointly with those of his co-defendant.\nAppellant claims his confrontation rights were violated by conducting his penalty phase jointly with co-defendant Lopez; he further claims the joint penalty phase precluded his receiving an individualized sentence. Appellant first argues the joint penalty phase exacerbated the error arising from the improper admission of Lopez\u2019s redacted statements during the guilt phase. He further argues that hearing Lopez\u2019s penalty phase evidence put the jury at risk of comparing appellant with Lopez, rather than affording appellant individualized consideration.\nThere is no requirement that co-defendants receive separate penalty hearings once both are found guilty; however, each defendant must receive individualized sentencing. See Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 602, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (concept of individualized sentencing in criminal cases has long been accepted). Absent any showing the defendant was prejudiced by the trial court\u2019s refusal to sever the proceedings, we will find no abuse of discretion by the trial court. See Lopez, at 501.\nAs discussed supra, appellant\u2019s confrontation rights were not violated by the admission of Lopez\u2019s redacted statements during the guilt phase; thus, the admission of such statements did not affect appellant\u2019s confrontation rights at the penalty phase. Additionally, Lopez testified and was cross-examined at the penalty phase. With respect to the argument that Lopez\u2019s penalty phase evidence made appellant \u201clook bad\u201d in comparison, we note Lopez received the same sentence of death as appellant; thus, appellant hardly looked worse to the jury than Lopez. Furthermore, the record belies appellant\u2019s claim he did not receive an individualized sentence: the trial court instructed the jury each defendant was to be sentenced individually and each sentence was to be determined separately, N.T. Trial, 3/20/96, at 21, 141; the trial court repeated the instructions on aggravating and mitigating circumstances for each defendant, id., at 141-44; and the jury was given a separate individualized verdict sheet for each defendant. Id., at 145-47. As the jury is presumed to have followed the trial court\u2019s instructions, see Commonwealth v. Baker, 531 Pa. 541, 614 A.2d 663, 672 (1992), there is no need to remand for development of this meritless claim. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether the Commonwealth ivas improperly permitted to introduce irrelevant and inflammatory testimony that appellant allegedly used an alias.\nAppellant claims during the penalty phase, the Commonwealth improperly introduced evidence of his use of an alias. While testifying about appellant\u2019s history of prior violent crimes in Puerto Rico, a Puerto Rican police officer mentioned appellant initially gave him an incorrect name during the investigation for those crimes. See N.T. Trial, 3/20/96, at 49-54. Following counsel\u2019s objection, the trial court gave a cautionary instruction, informing the jury: \u201cThe alias that was used in this particular situation really isn\u2019t important and critical. The issue is whether or not [appellant] engaged in a crime of violence in Puerto Rico, that the investigator is talking about.\u201d Id., at 54. Appellant contends this instruction was inadequate because it did not tell the jury it could not use the alias against him in deciding his sentence; thus, the testimony injected non-statutory aggravating evidence into the sentencing proceeding.\nThere is nothing in the record that supports appellant\u2019s contention the jury somehow used this fact as an additional aggravating factor; the verdict sheet shows the statutory factors that were found, and the jury is presumed to have followed the trial court\u2019s instruction to not focus on appellant\u2019s use of an alias, Baker, at 672, but rather on the statutory aggravating factor of his prior crimes of violence. As the PCRA court noted, \u201cthe use of a false name pales in comparison to the other facts that were submitted to the jury concerning [appellant] and his prior criminal history.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 9/15/00, at 11. Appellant was not prejudiced by this testimony, so remand for further development of this claim is unnecessary. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether the Commonwealth ivas improperly permitted to introduce facts and sentences of appellant\u2019s prior convictions during the penalty phase of his trial.\nAppellant claims the Commonwealth was improperly permitted to introduce the underlying facts and sentences he received for his prior convictions of voluntary manslaughter, robbery, conspiracy, attempted murder, and car-jacking in Puerto Rico; this evidence was introduced through the testimony of two Puerto Rican police officers to establish the (d)(9) aggravator (defendant has significant history of felony convictions involving use or threat of violence to person) and the (d)(12) aggravator (defendant convicted of voluntary manslaughter, as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503, or substantially similar crime in any other jurisdiction, either before or at time of offense in issue). Appellant argues Commonwealth v. Rompilla, 539 Pa. 499, 653 A.2d 626 (1995), held the details of a prior conviction may be introduced only if such evidence is necessary to prove the convictions involved \u201cthe use or threat of violence to the person.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 72 (citing Rompilla, at 633). Therefore, he claims, because his prior felonies were offenses which, by definition, involved the use or threat of violence, the Commonwealth should have been precluded from introducing the underlying details of the offenses.\nThis Court recently addressed this issue in Commonwealth v. Rios, 591 Pa. 583, 920 A.2d 790 (2007). In rejecting the appellant\u2019s contention that details of prior convictions may not be introduced at the penalty phase, we relied on Commonwealth v. Marshall, 537 Pa. 336, 643 A.2d 1070 (1994):\n\u201c[a] capital sentencing hearing is not a sanitized proceeding limited only to evidence of aggravating circumstances. Rather, it must, by necessity, inform the jury of the history and natural development of the events and offenses with which the appellant is charged, as well as those which he has been convicted, so that the jury may truly understand the nature of the offenses and Appellant\u2019s character. The jury simply cannot perform its function in ignorance of the facts of the crime for which Appellant is being sentenced, or the crimes for which he has previously been convicted, to the extent that those crimes may properly support the existence of aggravating circumstances provided in Section 9711(d).\u201d\nRios, at 814-15 (quoting Marshall, at 1074) (emphasis in original). Furthermore, we stated, \u201cAny reliance on Rompilla ... is misplaced as in that case we specifically held that the introduction of the details regarding the appellant\u2019s prior conviction for rape were properly admitted in support of \u00a7 9711(d)(9).\u201d Id., at 815 n. 9.\nThus, we perceive no error in the admission of the underlying facts of appellant\u2019s prior violent felonies; remand for further development of this issue is unwarranted. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether appellant\u2019s right to a fair capital trial and sentencing was violated by the prosecutor\u2019s improper injection of irrelevant and inflammatory past \u201cbad acts\u201d evidence.\nAppellant claims improperly introduced guilt phase evidence of his prior bad acts was incorporated by reference into the penalty phase without a limiting instruction, and the jury considered it as evidence of his criminal propensity when sentencing him. The testimony of which appellant complains was given by Moreno, who stated he, appellant, Lopez, and Barbosa were in Allentown because they \u201cwere looking for some drug dealers to rob. We didn\u2019t find any.\u201d N.T. Trial Vol. Ill, 3/12/96, at 24. Counsel\u2019s objection to this statement was overruled.\nAs the trial court noted, this was not a reference to criminal activity; the \u201cact\u201d Moreno referred to never happened. See id., at 25. Furthermore, to the extent the statement suggested appellant committed a \u201cbad act,\u201d evidence of other crimes is admissible for legitimate evidentiary purposes, such as to show motive or intent, or where the act was part of a chain of events forming the history of the case and was part of its natural development. See Commonwealth v. Seiders, 531 Pa. 592, 614 A.2d 689, 691 (1992); see also Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2), (3). Moreno\u2019s testimony provided the motive for the crime, was probative of intent, and gave the background of the planning of the murder. See N.T.Trial Vol. Ill, 3/12/96, at 26 (\u201c[T]hey said that if there was no drug dealers, to rob the landlord.\u201d). Appellant\u2019s claim is meritless; remand for further development of it is unnecessary. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether the Commonwealth improperly introduced unreliable and speculative evidence that the victim experienced \u201cterror. \u201d\nAppellant claims the Commonwealth\u2019s forensic expert, Dr. Isadore Mihalakis, improperly testified the victim experienced terror. This testimony was in response to the prosecutor\u2019s query about what occurs during ligature strangulation, the manner in which the victim died:\nWhat is required is that the ligature be tightened, the blood supply compromised or closed off, the windpipe narrowed, the air supply and oxygenation of the blood being reduced, the brain being deprived of oxygen. There is a period of struggle until the person passes out. The period of struggle is, depending on whether and how quickly the ligature is tightened, it may be quick, as low as 10, 15 seconds, or it may last seconds or minutes depending on how, during this period of time, the person is conscious, alive, appreciates what is happening. It\u2019s a very terrifying period and then the person passes out and then we have those windows that I spoke of before.\nN.T. Trial Vol. Ill, 3/12/96, at 181 (emphasis added). Appellant argues this was an impermissible reference to the victim\u2019s state of mind, and the incorporation of the guilt phase evidence into the penalty phase tainted his sentencing as well as his trial.\nThe identical issue was raised in co-defendant Lopez\u2019s PCRA appeal, in which we stated:\n\u201cExpert testimony is permitted as an aid to the jury when the subject matter is distinctly related to a science, skill, or occupation beyond the knowledge or experience of the average layman.\u201d Commonwealth v. Auker, [545 Pa. 521] 681 A.2d 1305, 1317 (Pa.1996). The average layperson is generally unacquainted with the physical processes accompanying ligature strangulation; therefore, this was a proper subject for Dr. Mihalakis to explain. While perhaps the comment about a \u201cterrifying period\u201d may not have been necessary, it did little more than articulate the obvious; any conscious person is going to be terrified as they are strangled to death. Viewed in the context of the entire trial, there was nothing prejudicial about Dr. Mihalakis\u2019 statement. Even the challenged remark was given in a general, non-specific manner; the doctor was not speculating about the experience of this victim.\nCommonwealth v. Lopez, 578 Pa. 545, 854 A.2d 465, 470 (2004). For the same reasons, appellant\u2019s claim fails, and further remand is unnecessary. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate, develop, and present substantial mitigating evidence.\nAppellant claims trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate, develop, and present substantial mitigating evidence during the penalty phase, and appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue this claim. Appellant argues trial counsel should have interviewed family members so that evidence of appellant\u2019s abusive and traumatic childhood, history of head injuries and strange behavior, auditory and visual hallucinations, and family history of mental illness could have been presented in support of the (e)(8) \u201ccatch-all\u201d mitigator. He further claims trial counsel should have asked him about his history of drug and alcohol abuse, as such evidence would also have supported the (e)(8) mitigator. Finally, appellant claims trial counsel should have secured an expert mental health evaluation of him and presented such evidence in support of the (e)(8) mitigator.\nDuring the opening, closing, and cross-examination of Commonwealth witnesses in the penalty phase, trial counsel attempted to minimize appellant\u2019s role in the murder, as well as his role in prior crimes in Puerto Rico. See N.T. Trial, 3/20/96, at 29-30, 45, 59, 118, 120, 126. Appellant was the only witness counsel called; counsel elicited testimony that appellant was raised by his grandmother because his parents had problems, only completed ninth grade, worked in a gas station and obtained a mechanic\u2019s certificate, had been married and had two young children in Puerto Rico for whom he provided, and that his role in the crime was minimal. Id., at 77-87. In closing, counsel asked the jury to show mercy, emphasizing appellant had a family. Id., at 122, 124, 126. The trial court instructed the jury on two mitigating circumstances: the (e)(7) \u201cminor participant\u201d mitigator and the (e)(8) \u201ccatch-all\u201d mitigator. Id., at 144. The jury found neither circumstance.\nAt the PCRA hearing, appellant presented the testimony of two experts and five family members who he asserted should have been called at the penalty phase, as well as that of trial and appellate counsel. Dr. Latterner, a neuropsychologist who examined appellant, testified appellant had an IQ in the low borderline range of cognition and had the cognitive capacity of a 12 or 13-year-old. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/25/00, at 36, 48. She further testified appellant had organic brain syndrome, memory impairment, and lack of impulse control. Id., at 21, 27, 38. She cited his prior history of head injuries, drug abuse, and hallucinations, id., at 61-62, opining that at the time of the offense, appellant was suffering from an extreme emotional or mental disturbance and was unable to conform his actions to the law. Id,, at 42-43, 47, 64-65,113. Although noting appellant denied having any problems and that his prior pre-sentence report from Puerto Rico revealed no psychiatric history, id., at 69-70, 74, Dr. Latterner concluded psychiatric testing should have been pursued prior to appellant\u2019s trial. Id., at 62.\nDr. Bernstein, a forensic neuropsychiatrist who \u2022 examined appellant, testified he diagnosed appellant with organic cognitive disorder resulting from trauma, toxin exposure, and drug exposure. Id., at 138-40. He testified appellant had a personality disorder, impaired impulse control, and suffered from an extreme emotional or mental disturbance which impaired his capacity and rendered him unable to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or conform to the law\u2019s requirements. Id., at 142, 183, 148, 151, 174-75. He acknowledged appellant\u2019s prison, school, and medical records revealed no testing regarding brain damage or indicia of organic brain injury, N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/30/00, at 541; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 594; however, he opined appellant\u2019s minimization of any current mental health problems indicated appellant did have problems, and a layperson would \u201cbegin to pick up that [appellant] might not be hitting on all eight cylinders[,]\u201d but probably would not know \u201cwhy there was a problem.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/30/00, at 543. He concluded, given appellant\u2019s history, which was \u201creplete with red flags of his neurological and other deficits[,]\u201d trial counsel should have commissioned a neuropsychiatric examination. Id., at 503; see N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/25/00, at 187.\nAppellant\u2019s mother, sister, brother, cousin, ex-wife, and girlfriend testified about appellant\u2019s upbringing and young adult life. Appellant was a sickly infant, N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/30/00, at 370, 411-12, born into an abusive marriage, id., at 366-69, 414-15, and his father abused him emotionally and physically, id., at 372-73, 377-78, 432-34, even hitting him on the head. Id., at 413. Appellant was left to be raised by his paternal grandmother at the age of two, with virtually no contact with his parents until he was 11. Id., at 373, 380, 416, 425. Appellant\u2019s sister testified he was picked on in school, id., at 384, and appellant\u2019s cousin testified appellant was injured as a child when he was hit in the head with a bat during a ball game. Id., at 480. Appellant\u2019s brother and sister testified appellant rode a motorcycle in his youth, fell off frequently, and never wore a helmet. Id., at 385-86, 437. Both appellant\u2019s mother and girlfriend testified appellant\u2019s grandfather had been mentally ill. Id., at 416, 453.\nAppellant\u2019s brother, sister, and cousin testified there were changes in appellant\u2019s behavior when he began using cocaine as a young adult; he became agitated, nervous, and paranoid. Id., at 386-88, 438-39, 483-84. Appellant\u2019s cousin and girlfriend testified appellant never wore a mask when working with chemical fumes in his job as a mechanic during his teenage years, id., at 482, 455, and appellant\u2019s ex-wife said he was exposed to fumes and chemicals at his job, N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/26/00, at 292-93, and he would often suffer from dizziness and headaches. Id., at 290. He once suffered a temporary bout of* blindness following a dizzy spell. Id., at 294-95.\nAppellant\u2019s ex-wife testified appellant had auditory hallucinations, id., at 290, and he once hallucinated seeing the devil and was so traumatized he soiled himself. Id., at 291. Appellant\u2019s girlfriend also testified concerning appellant\u2019s auditory hallucinations, N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/30/00, at 454, 457, and said he was often agitated by nightmares. Id., at 455. She also confirmed his drug use. Id., at 456.\nAppellant\u2019s mother, brother, and cousin testified trial counsel never contacted them, but that they would have been willing to testify on appellant\u2019s behalf had they been asked. Id., at 420-21, 439, 485. Appellant\u2019s sister testified that although trial counsel interviewed her, he did not ask her about appellant\u2019s background; however, she would have testified concerning these facts had she been asked. Id., at 389-90. Appellant\u2019s ex-wife testified she would have been willing to testify for appellant at trial, but trial counsel never asked her. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/26/00, at 293.\nTrial counsel testified that although he had 17 years\u2019 experience, which included criminal cases, this had been his first capital case. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 610-11, 660. He met with appellant about 15 or 20 times, having lengthy discussions with him. Id., at 639. Counsel acknowledged he did not contact appellant\u2019s mother, brother, and cousin, id., at 623, and did not question appellant\u2019s sister and ex-wife about appellant\u2019s childhood, head injuries, drug abuse, and performance in school. Id., at 624-27, 632. He acknowledged these were not omissions born of strategy. Counsel testified that although the information provided by appellant\u2019s family in their affidavits and at the PCRA hearing was something he would have wanted to know during the penalty phase, id., at 633, he would not have presented the testimony of appellant\u2019s girlfriend, who had been involved in appellant\u2019s prior crimes in Puerto Rico and would have marred the image of appellant as a stable family-man. Id., at 651, 703. Counsel testified he had no tactical reason for not having appellant psychologically evaluated, id., at 633, and the expert testimony regarding appellant\u2019s organic brain damage would have been relevant at the penalty phase. Id., at 634.\nOther portions of counsel\u2019s testimony, however, revealed he was not remiss in his inquiries regarding mitigation evidence, based on the information appellant supplied him and his interactions with appellant. Counsel said appellant gave him very little information about his family, id., at 647-48; he had the impression appellant was estranged from his family, most of whom were in Puerto Rico, and did not seem to want to involve them. Id., at 620-23. When counsel asked appellant if there was anyone in Puerto Rico who could help with his case, appellant said no, id., at 648, 703; it was counsel\u2019s impression appellant did not want his family contacted, although he never explicitly forbade counsel from doing so. Id., at 704-05. Counsel further testified because appellant had been raised by his grandmother and his immediate family had not been significantly involved in his upbringing, he thought they would have little relevant information to offer concerning appellant\u2019s childhood. Id., at 690. Counsel also asked appellant about his schooling and was aware appellant dropped out of school to work as a mechanic. Id., at 649.\nRegarding appellant\u2019s drug use, counsel testified he would have offered this as mitigation evidence had he known about it, id., at 652; however, counsel stated he asked appellant if he was on drugs during the planning and commission of the offense, and appellant responded he was not. Id., at 627-28, 652, 698-99. When counsel asked if appellant had used drugs on other occasions, such as during his travels in New Jersey and Florida where he committed other crimes with his co-defendants, appellant said he had not. Id., at 628, 652-54, 698-99. Thus, counsel concluded appellant did not have a drug problem. Id., at 628, 699.\nRegarding appellant\u2019s mental health, counsel asked appellant whether he had any medical problems or anything that would be helpful in his defense; appellant said he had \u201cnothing like that.\u201d Id., at 620. Counsel asked appellant if he ever had emotional or psychiatric difficulties, and appellant responded he had not. Id., at 654. Appellant said nothing about his auditory or visual hallucinations, id., at 655, and there was nothing from his demeanor which would have led counsel to believe he had any type of mental disorder. Id., at 658, 660-61, 691-92. Counsel stated appellant was \u201cvery pleasant\u201d and \u201ceven tempered,\u201d id., and although appellant seemed depressed because of his situation, \u201che never, ever, never exhibited ... any unusual behaviors.... \u201d Id., at 659. Counsel noted he had previous clients who he had immediately sought to have evaluated based upon their conduct, but appellant did not display such signs of mental illness, and counsel never doubted appellant\u2019s ability to participate in his defense. Id., at 660. Thus, counsel did not seek a psychiatric evaluation for appellant.\nAppellant relies on Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000), in arguing counsel was required to investigate reasonably mitigating evidence of childhood abuse, family dysfunction and neglect, and mental health deficits. Appellant argues even if he told counsel he had nothing to offer in the way of mitigating evidence, counsel still had an independent duty to investigate his background in preparation for the penalty phase. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 35. Recently, in Commonwealth v. Gorby, 589 Pa. 364, 909 A.2d 775 (2006), and Commonwealth v. Jones, 590 Pa. 202, 912 A.2d 268 (2006), this Court cited Williams and Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003), \u201cfor the proposition that capital counsel have an obligation to pursue all reasonably available avenues of developing mitigation evidence.\u201d Gorby, at 790; see also Jones; at 293.\nAt the time of appellant\u2019s 1996 trial, however, these cases had not been decided, and the degree of investigation required for capital counsel to not be deemed ineffective had not evolved to the extent currently required. \u201cA fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d Commonwealth v. Bond, 572 Pa. 588, 819 A.2d 33, 51 (2002) (quoting Strickland, at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052) (emphasis added).\nPrior to Williams and its progeny, case law regarding what is required of counsel during the penalty phase was not as exacting as today. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Rollins, 558 Pa. 532, 738 A.2d 435, 448 (1999) (counsel not ineffective for failing to present mental health mitigating evidence where counsel had no reason to know appellant might have mental problem); Commonwealth v. Holland, 556 Pa. 175, 727 A.2d 563, 566 (1999) (counsel not ineffective for failing to call mental health expert at penalty phase, where forensic psychiatrist\u2019s reports and previous pre-sentence reports indicated appellant did not suffer from major mental illness); Commonwealth v. Howard, 553 Pa. 266, 719 A.2d 233, 238 (1998) (counsel not ineffective where no evidence counsel had notice appellant had any mental illness); Commonwealth v. Uderra, 550 Pa. 389, 706 A.2d 334, 340 (1998) (counsel not ineffective for failing to investigate appellant\u2019s history of psychological problems where appellant never revealed such information to counsel). Thus, the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s actions cannot be assessed under requirements enunciated subsequent to the time of such actions.\nTrial counsel, during his numerous interactions with appellant, never detected any signs of mental illness, and appellant never gave counsel any useful information about his childhood or family when asked. See Commonwealth v. Carson, 590 Pa. 501, 913 A.2d 220, 266 (2006) (in evaluating reasonableness of counsel\u2019s investigation, court must remember counsel\u2019s decisions may depend heavily on information his client provides to him). Appellant\u2019s prison records revealed no psychiatric problems other than situational depression; various reports indicated appellant denied ever having hallucinations, drug abuse problems, or head injuries. Although one of the reports recommended appellant receive substance abuse counseling because he was in denial about his past drug use, see Psychiatric Evaluation 6/21/96, R.R. Ex. 39, at 76, appellant denied having been on drugs when counsel questioned him about drug use at the time of the offense, and appellant offered nothing further regarding his past cocaine use. Overall, appellant\u2019s records showed no prior psychiatric history; one of the psychiatric reports indicated although appellant was immature, impulsive, and oppositionally defiant, he was not mentally ill. See Undated Report, R.R. Ex. 39, at 74-75. Appellant\u2019s school records revealed nothing other than his being a poor student. See R.R. Ex. 35. Under these circumstances, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to pursue a psychiatric evaluation or to investigate evidence of appellant\u2019s childhood, alleged head injuries, and substance abuse.\nCounsel testified his trial strategy was to show appellant was not a participant in the crime, or that if he did participate, his role was minimal and peripheral. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 636-37. Counsel attempted to do this at the penalty phase; the fact that in hindsight, another strategy may have been more effective does not render him ineffective. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is meritless, and there is no need to remand for still more development of this claim. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether t\u00f1al counsel ineffectively failed to investigate, develop, and present the evidence of co-defendant George Lopez\u2019s history of involvement in similar crimes.\nAppellant claims trial counsel failed to investigate and present evidence of Lopez\u2019s history of similar crimes at the penalty phase; appellant contends this evidence would have demonstrated Lopez bore \u201cthe lion\u2019s share\u201d of culpability and would have supported the defense theory that appellant was only a minor participant in the crime. Appellant further argues this evidence constituted Brady material which the Commonwealth had a duty to provide him.\nContrary to appellant\u2019s assertion, Lopez was not previously convicted of robbery or attempted murder; instead, he pled nolo contendere to simple assault. See PCRA Court Opinion, 9/15/00, at 20; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 677-78. Furthermore, trial counsel testified he would not have wanted this evidence before the jury, as \u201cif [he] blackened Lopez\u2019s eyes then [he] blacken[ed] [appellant\u2019s] eyes,\u201d id., at 673, this being a joint trial. Thus, counsel would not have wanted to show Lopez was capable of such crime, because appellant was associated with Lopez. For the same reason, appellant\u2019s argument that this evidence constituted Brady material fails, as Lopez\u2019s prior history would have made appellant look worse rather than exculpating him. Remand for further development of these meritless claims is unwarranted. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether appellant was improperly precluded from presenting and arguing the jury should consider, as mitigation, the lesser sentences imposed on the individuals who planned and carried out the murder of David Bolasky.\nAppellant claims he was improperly precluded from arguing at the penalty phase that the jury should consider, as mitigation, the lesser sentences imposed on his co-conspirators. This issue was presented and rejected in Lopez\u2019s PCRA appeal; we cited Commonwealth v. Frey, 520 Pa. 338, 554 A.2d 27, 33 (1989) and Commonwealth v. Haag, 522 Pa. 388, 562 A.2d 289, 299 (1989), which held the fact a co-defendant received a sentence less than death is not a mitigating circumstance for purposes of sentencing another defendant for the same crime. We noted, \u201cThere is no mitigating circumstance which provides for the type of comparison appellant suggests; even the \u2018catch-all\u2019 mitigating circumstance would not encompass evidence of co-conspirators\u2019 sentences because such evidence has nothing to do with \u2018the character and record of the defendant\u2019 or \u2018the circumstances of his offense.\u2019 \u201d Lopez, 854 A.2d at 471 (citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8)). Furthermore, appellant overlooks the fact that Barbosa pled guilty in exchange for the lesser sentence of life, and Moreno plea bargained for a 20 to 40-year sentence in exchange for his cooperation with law enforcement. See Romero, at 1016; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/26/00, at 199, 304. Thus, appellant\u2019s claim is meritless, and we need not remand for further development of this argument. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether the trial court erred in allowing the jury to consider Jorge Barbosa\u2019s inadmissible statement to Captain Bucarey during the penalty phase proceedings.\nAppellant\u2019s next claim involves the incorporation of certain evidence from the guilt phase into the penalty phase. Appellant argues the incorporation of Barbosa\u2019s prior statement, read at the guilt phase, into the penalty phase prejudiced him because the statement was the only evidence appellant participated in the killing and Bolasky was killed to prevent his testimony. As the jury found the (d)(5) \u201cwitness elimination\u201d aggravator, but not the (e)(7) \u201cminor participant\u201d mitigator, appellant claims Barbosa\u2019s statement \u201csinglehandedly established the \u2018witness elimination\u2019 aggravator for the Commonwealth while simultaneously gutting [a]ppellant\u2019s \u2018minor participant\u2019 mitigator.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 52 (emphasis in original).\nContrary to appellant\u2019s contention, Barbosa\u2019s statement was not the only evidence of appellant\u2019s direct participation in the robbery and strangling of Bolasky; the testimony of Moreno and Daniel Lopez established appellant was more than a minor participant in the killing. Furthermore, these witnesses\u2019 testimony established the victim was killed to prevent his testimony against appellant and the others. Therefore, as in the guilt phase, the incorporation of Barbosa\u2019s erroneously admitted prior statement into the penalty phase was harmless error. See Romero, at 1019 (citing Commonwealth v. Foy, 531 Pa. 322, 612 A.2d 1349, 1352 (1992) (error is harmless where improperly admitted evidence is merely cumulative of substantially similar, properly admitted evidence)). Appellant\u2019s claim is meritless; therefore, remand is unwarranted. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether appellant\u2019s death sentence was based on the unconstitutional application of the (d)(5) \u201cwitness elimination\u201d aggravating circumstance.\nAppellant claims the jury improperly found the (d)(5) \u201cwitness elimination\u201d aggravating circumstance, because there was no evidence Bolasky was killed to prevent his testifying against appellant; rather, appellant\u2019s co-conspirators testified they killed Bolasky to prevent his identifying Moreno, who he recognized as his tenant. Appellant also claims there was no direct evidence the killing occurred for such purpose, as is required when there is no pending prosecution at the time of the murder. See Commonwealth v. Strong, 522 Pa. 445, 563 A.2d 479, 485 (1989).\nIn Strong, this Court reiterated the holding in Commonwealth v. Appel, 517 Pa. 529, 539 A.2d 780 (1988), that the (d)(5) aggravating circumstance may be established by direct evidence the killing resulted from the intention to eliminate a potential witness. Strong, at 485 (quoting Appel, at 784 n. 2). Previously, the rule was that evidence must be introduced that the killing was to prevent the victim\u2019s testimony in a pending grand jury or criminal proceeding. See Commonwealth v. Caldwell, 516 Pa. 441, 532 A.2d 813, 817 (1987); Commonwealth v. Crawley, 514 Pa. 539, 526 A.2d 334, 344-45 (1987).\nThe Commonwealth relied on Barbosa\u2019s guilt phase testimony to establish the (d)(5) aggravating circumstance; Barbosa testified the initial plan was only to assault Bolasky, but then they decided to kill him to prevent him from identifying his tenant, Moreno, who was Lopez\u2019s nephew:\nA. It was just a matter of assaulting him. But then he came and said no, he had to be killed.\nQ. Who said that?\nA. Mr. Ivan Lopez.\nQ. Did he say why Mr. Bolasky had to be killed?\nA. Because if we had left him alive, then [Lopez\u2019s] nephew would go to jail for the assault.\nN.T. Trial, 3/15/96, at 27.\nBarbosa further testified on cross-examination:\nA. And [Lopez] told me we have to kill the gentleman because if the gentleman stays alive, then his nephew is gonna go to jail, understand?\nId., at 85.\nAlthough the fact-finder could have inferred appellant and his co-conspirators killed Bolasky to prevent his identifying all of his assailants because all of the conspirators stood to lose if Bolasky remained alive to implicate them, there was no direct evidence that Bolasky was killed to prevent his testimony against appellant; Barbosa\u2019s testimony established Lopez\u2019s concern that the victim would identify Moreno. Id. However, even if the (d)(5) aggravator was not established, the jury found other aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances; the penalty would still have been death. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv); Commonwealth v. Christy, 511 Pa. 490, 515 A.2d 832, 842 (1986) (since jury found one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances, death sentence upheld even though another aggravating circumstance is held invalid) (citing Commonwealth v. Beasley, 504 Pa. 485, 475 A.2d 730, 738 (1984)). Thus, even without the (d)(5) aggravator, the result of the penalty phase would not have differed, so we need not remand for further development of appellant\u2019s claim. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether the jury improperly found the existence of the (d)(6) aggravator.\nAppellant claims the trial court improperly instructed the jury regarding the (d)(6) aggravating circumstance (defendant committed killing during perpetration of felony), because he was merely an accomplice to the murder and did not actually strangle Bolasky; thus, the jury improperly found this aggravator. Appellant contends the trial court should have instructed the jury, pursuant to Commonwealth v. Lassiter, 554 Pa. 586, 722 A.2d 657 (1998) (plurality), the (d)(6) aggravator is inapplicable to one who is found guilty of first degree murder as an accomplice, but not as the actual killer.\nLassiter held \u201c[\u00a7 ] 9711(d)(6) may not be applied to an accomplice who does not \u2018commit\u2019 the killing in the sense of bringing it to completion or finishing it.\u201d Id., at 662. Even if the jury found appellant guilty as an accomplice to first degree murder, thereby rendering the (d)(6) aggravator inapplicable, at least two other aggravating circumstances, \u00a7 9711(d)(9) and (12), existed, and no mitigating circumstances were found; the penalty would still have been death. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv); Christy, supra. Thus, appellant is unable to establish the result of the penalty phase would have differed had a Lassiter instruction been given, and further remand for development of his ineffectiveness claim in this regard is unnecessary. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether the jwy improperly found the (d)(12) aggravator.\nAppellant claims the jury improperly found the (d)(12) aggravating circumstance (defendant convicted of voluntary manslaughter as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503, or substantially similar crime in any other jurisdiction, either before or at time of instant offense). The Commonwealth relied on appellant\u2019s prior conviction for manslaughter in Puerto Rico under 33 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 4004:\nAny person who kills another as a result of a sudden quarrel or fit of anger shall be punished by imprisonment for a fixed term of ten years. Should there be aggravating circumstances, the fixed term established may be increased to a maximum of fifteen years; if there should be extenuating circumstances, it may be reduced to a minimum of six years.\nId.\nSection 2503 of the Crimes Code defines voluntary manslaughter as follows:\n(a) General Rule. \u2014 A person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits voluntary manslaughter if at the time of the killing he is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by:\n(1) the individual killed; or\n(2) another whom the actor endeavors to kill, but he negligently or accidentally causes the death of the individual killed.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503(a).\nAppellant argues intent to kill is an element of Pennsylvania\u2019s crime of voluntary manslaughter, but is not an element under Puerto Rico\u2019s crime of manslaughter; therefore, the two crimes are not substantially similar as \u00a7 9711(d)(12) requires. Contrary to appellant\u2019s claim, however, intent to kill is an element of manslaughter under 33 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 4004; it is premeditation that is not a required element. See Pueblo v. Moreno Morales, 132 D.P.R. 261 (1992). Puerto Rico\u2019s crime of voluntary manslaughter, 33 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 4005, only requires negligence, which is not the same element of intent as required by Pennsylvania\u2019s \u00a7 2503. See Pueblo v. Rivera, 123 D.P.R. 739 (1989). However, appellant was convicted under \u00a7 4004 (manslaughter), not \u00a7 4005 (voluntary manslaughter); therefore, the intent element is not negligence, and is substantially similar to \u00a7 2503. As appellant\u2019s claim is meritless, further remand is unnecessary. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether appellant is entitled to relief from his death sentence because of the prosecutor\u2019s improper closing argument\nAppellant claims the prosecutor made several improper arguments during his penalty phase closing, that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object, and appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise the issue on direct appeal. Our standard of review is well settled:\n\u201cChallenged prosecutorial comments must be considered in the context in which they were made.\u201d [Commonwealth v.] King, [554 Pa. 331] 721 A.2d [763,] 783 [ (Pa.1998) ]. In reviewing the statements made by the prosecutor, we have noted that:\n[A] prosecutor must be free to present his or her arguments with logical force and vigor. Reversible error only exists if the prosecutor has deliberately attempted to destroy the objectivity of the fact finder such that the unavoidable effect of the inappropriate comments would be to create such bias and hostility toward the defendant that the jury could not render a true verdict.\n[Commonwealth v.] Miles, [545 Pa. 500] 681 A.2d [1295,] 1300 [ (Pa.1996) (citations omitted) ]; also see [Commonwealth v.] Paddy, [569 Pa. 47] 800 A.2d [294,] 316 [ (Pa. 2002) ]. \u201cFurthermore, during the penalty phase, where the presumption of innocence is no longer applicable, the prosecutor is permitted even greater latitude in presenting argument.\u201d King, 721 A.2d at 783.\nMoreover, even if the alleged statements by the prosecutor may have been improper, we have held that \u201cnot every intemperate or uncalled for remark by a prosecutor requires a new trial.\u201d Miles, 681 A.2d at 1302. Indeed, \u201cwhere the properly admitted evidence of guilt is so overwhelming and the prejudicial effect of the error is so insignificant by comparison that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error could not have contributed to the verdict, then the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. (citing Commonwealth v. Story, [476 Pa. 391] 383 A.2d 155, 166 (Pa.1978)).\nCommonwealth v. Robinson, 581 Pa. 154, 864 A.2d 460, 517 (2004).\nAppellant claims the prosecutor diminished the jury\u2019s sense of responsibility for imposing the death penalty by stating, \u201c[T]his decision is not something that you are doing. This decision is not something that you are making. This decision was made on January 8, 1995, by George Ivan Lopez and Edwin Rios R[o]mero.\u201d N.T. Trial, 3/20/96, at 107. However, appellant isolates a portion of the prosecutor\u2019s entire statement and takes it out of context; the prosecutor continued, \u201cThe law is written in stone. What they have done, is done. Your job is to apply those two things and render a correct verdict.\u201d Id. Thus, the prosecutor was not suggesting the jury abdicate its responsibility for determining whether the death penalty was warranted, but rather was arguing appellant and his co-defendant were responsible for the victim\u2019s death and must face the consequences. Appellant\u2019s claim is meritless.\nAppellant argues the prosecutor improperly argued the circumstances of the offense alone required imposition of a death sentence when he stated appellant\u2019s actions \u201csealed this verdict\u201d and such actions \u201crequire[d] a [death] verdict.\u201d Id., at 108. However, appellant again isolates only a portion of the prosecutor\u2019s entire statement. The prosecutor argued the (d)(6) aggravator (killing committed during perpetration of felony) alone was sufficient to warrant a death sentence; in so doing, he stated appellant\u2019s killing the victim during the robbery was an aggravating circumstance which would permit the jury to impose the death penalty. As this was permissible argument, see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv) (verdict must be sentence of death if jury finds at least one aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances or one or more aggravating circumstances which outweigh any mitigating circumstances), appellant\u2019s claim fails.\nAppellant argues the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of the police witnesses and conveyed the impression there was evidence not presented to the jury which supported the charges against appellant. Appellant does not quote any specific portion of the prosecutor\u2019s statement; however, the transcript page he references merely contains a summary of the investigative actions of police Detectives Hanna and O\u2019Donnell, who both testified at trial. See N.T. Trial, 8/20/96, at 110. Read in context, this was not a reference to evidence outside the record, nor was it vouching for the officers\u2019 credibility; it was simply a narrative of the events that produced Moreno\u2019s confession. This claim is meritless.\nAppellant argues the prosecutor improperly argued appellant posed a danger if sentenced to life imprisonment:\nEdwin Rios R[o]mero has also compiled a significant history of prior felony convictions which involved violence or the threat of violence.... Why is that an aggravating circumstance? Because it shows that Edwin Rios R[o]mero has been persistent in his refusal to curb his violent behavior. Again and again and again, Mr. R[o]mero has been convicted of felonies that involve violence or the threat of violence. There is a pattern here, ladies and gentlemen, and that in itself, all by itself, is an aggravating circumstance. And once again, all by itself, that aggravating circumstance is sufficient to warrant you returning a penalty of death in this case.\nId., at 112 (emphasis added).\nAgain, appellant isolates a portion of the prosecutor\u2019s statement and takes it out of context, focusing only on the underlined portion of the above quotation. Read in its entirety, the statement clearly is an argument for the (d)(9) \u201csignificant history of violent felonies\u201d aggravator, explaining why this is an aggravating circumstance and arguing its relevance in appellant\u2019s case; it is not an argument of future dangerousness.\nAppellant argues the prosecutor improperly introduced victim impact evidence when he referenced the victim\u2019s experience in the last seconds of his life; he further contends the prosecutor improperly urged the jury to exercise vengeance, showing appellant the same mercy he showed the victim. The prosecutor stated:\nI want you to think back to the last thing that David Bolasky saw as he knew he was dying. Do you know what the last thing David Bolasky saw, two of the last things that he saw? They\u2019re sitting right in front of you.... Think about that when they ask you for mercy.\nId., at 115.\nThis Court has specifically determined it is permissible during the penalty phase for a prosecutor to ask the jury to show the defendant the same mercy he showed the victim. Commonwealth v. Basemore, 525 Pa. 512, 582 A.2d 861, 870 (1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1102, 112 S.Ct. 1191, 117 L.Ed.2d 432 (1992); see also Commonwealth v. Washington, 549 Pa. 12, 700 A.2d 400, 415-16 (1997); Commonwealth v. Jones, 546 Pa. 161, 683 A.2d 1181, 1204 (1996) (citing Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 502 Pa. 474, 467 A.2d 288, 301 (1983)). This claim is meritless, as are all of appellant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct; accordingly, remand for further development of these claims with respect to appellate counsel\u2019s performance is unnecessary. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether appellant\u2019s death sentence is cruel and umisual punishment because appellant is mentally retarded.\nAppellant claims he cannot be subject to the death penalty because he is mentally retarded; he further argues, because of trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate this issue, the jury never heard evidence of his \u201cborderline\u201d retardation, and appellate counsel failed to present this claim on direct appeal.\nAtkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002), held execution of mentally retarded criminals violates the Eighth Amendment. Although Atkins was decided after appellant\u2019s trial and sentencing, this Court held since Atkins announced a new rule of law prohibiting a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status, it fell under an exception to the general rule of nonretroactivity. See Commonwealth v. Miller, 585 Pa. 144, 888 A.2d 624, 629 n. 5 (2005) (citing Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989)).\nIn Miller, the petitioner, having been denied relief after a hearing on his first PCRA petition, filed a second petition, seeking relief under Atkins. The PCRA court granted relief without an evidentiary hearing, reasoning the documentary evidence, the penalty phase evidence, and the evidence presented at the petitioner\u2019s first PCRA hearing established the petitioner\u2019s mental retardation by a preponderance of the evidence. The PCRA court applied the definitions of \u201cmentally retarded\u201d set forth by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and the American Association of Mental Retardation (AAMR). Miller, at 626-27. This Court vacated and remanded for further proceedings, id., at 638; although we agreed with the PCRA court that the petitioner could use either classification of \u201cmentally retarded\u201d to establish his claim, we concluded the testimony presented at the first PCRA hearing occurred in the context of establishing the petitioner suffered from organic brain damage as well as mental retardation. Id., at 632-3S. The testimony offered by the petitioner\u2019s expert was equivocal on the issue of mental retardation, since he testified the petitioner functioned in the \u201cborderline retarded\u201d or \u201cmentally retarded\u201d range. We noted:\n[T]here is a critical difference between these two classifications, since if a defendant is classified as having borderline intellectual functioning, he would not automatically be considered \u201cmentally retarded\u201d under Atkins unless he also showed significant deficits in adaptive behavior.\nId. Accordingly, we remanded for an evidentiary hearing specifically to address the mental retardation issue.\nHere, appellant presented two experts\u2019 testimony at his PCRA hearing; they testified on the issues of mental retardation, organic brain damage, mental illness, and capacity to form intent. This testimony fluctuated concerning the degree of appellant\u2019s mental impairment. Cf. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/25/00, at 36 (Dr. Latterner\u2019s testimony that he \u201cdo[es] not believe [appellant\u2019s] mentally retarded\u201d), id., at 44 (Dr. Latterner\u2019s testimony that appellant is \u201cfunctioning in the low borderline range\u201d), id., at 77 (Dr. Latterner\u2019s testimony that \u201cClearly, [appellant\u2019s] mentally retarded, and he\u2019s [sic] brain damage\u201d), and id., at 94-96 (Dr. Latterner\u2019s testimony that, despite two IQ scores in mentally retarded range, appellant is not mentally retarded); see also id., at 140 (Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony that appellant is \u201cmildly mentally retarded, borderline mentally retarded\u201d); id., at 159 (Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony that appellant suffers from \u201cMental Retardation, Mild Severity\u201d); id., at 160 (Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony that appellant is \u201cborderline mentally retarded\u201d); N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/30/00, at 517 (Dr. Bernstein\u2019s disagreement with Dr. Latterner that appellant is not mentally retarded); N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 576-77 (Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony that \u201c[s]ometimes you are going to test him, he\u2019s going to be mild MR[, s]ometimes you are going to test him, he\u2019s going to be borderline\u201d); id., at 585 (Dr. Bernstein\u2019s testimony that \u201cdepending on which version of the [test] you are giving, ... on a good day, he\u2019s going to be borderline, and on a bad day, he\u2019s going to be mildly mentally retarded\u201d). The Commonwealth\u2019s expert, Dr. Cooke, testified appellant was \u201cin the borderline range, not in the retarded range,\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/2/00, at 1088, and there was \u201cnothing in the records to indicate that he would fall into the impaired range in terms of activities, of daily living, either, so it\u2019s my opinion that he is of borderline intelligence, but he is not mentally retarded.\u201d Id., at 1088-89.\nThe PCRA court credited the testimony that appellant was not mentally retarded, noting:\nAlthough the legal, moral, and philosophical arguments concerning this issue are interesting and thought-provoking, these issues are irrelevant to this case since the Defendant does not fall into either category [of mentally retarded or mentally ill].\nPCRA Court Opinion, 9/15/00, at 10.\nSignificantly, appellant does not argue he is mentally retarded; rather, he labels himself \u201cborderline mentally retarded.\u201d See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 38 (\u201cMr. Romero is borderline mentally retarded\u201d); id., at 39-40 (\u201cthe jury never heard anything about [ajppellant\u2019s borderline mental retardation.\u201d). Under Miller, being \u201cborderline mentally retarded\u201d does not automatically place a person in the \u201cmentally retarded\u201d category; there also have to be \u201csignificant deficits in adaptive behavior.\u201d Miller, at 630 n. 8, 633.\nThe PCRA hearing testimony revealed appellant had an ex-wife in Puerto Rico, with whom he had children and bought a house, he could diagnose and fix mechanical problems with cars, and he was able to travel to New Jersey with his cousin and show him around, helping him find a job. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/25/00, at 84-85; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 569, 571. The Commonwealth\u2019s expert, Dr. Cooke, noted:\nThe other part of defining retardation is whether or not an individual is impaired in activities of daily living. Can they hold a job? Can they make purchases? Can they travel independently? Things of that nature. Can they communicate effectively? And I see nothing in the records to indicate that he would fall into the impaired range in terms of activities, of daily living, either, so it\u2019s my opinion that he is of borderline intelligence, but he is not mentally retarded.\nN.T. PCRA Hearing, 6/2/00, at 1088-89.\nThus, unlike Miller, there was a hearing at which testimony was heard on the issue of mental retardation, and the experts did not rely on IQ test results alone. The PCRA court\u2019s conclusion that appellant is not mentally retarded is supported by the record. As appellant\u2019s underlying claim fails, remand is unnecessary to develop the claim of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. See McGill, at 1026.\nWhether appellant is entitled to relief from his conviction and sentence because of the cumulative effect of the errors described herein.\nFinally, appellant claims the cumulative effect of all the alleged errors entitles him to relief. However, this Court has repeatedly stated, \u201cno number of failed claims may collectively attain merit if they could not do so individually.\u201d Commonwealth v. Williams, 532 Pa. 265, 615 A.2d 716, 722 (1992) (emphasis in original).\nHaving found appellant is not entitled to relief, we affirm the order of the PCRA court and direct the Prothonotary of this Court to transmit the complete record of this case to the Governor of Pennsylvania. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(i).\nOrder affirmed.\nJustice CASTILLE and FITZGERALD join the opinion.\nChief Justice CAPPY files a concurring opinion in which Justice BAER joins.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which Justice BALDWIN joins.\n. On direct appeal, this Court concluded the trial court erred in admitting Barbosa's prior statements, thus violating appellant's Confrontation Clause rights; however, we found the error was harmless because the evidence was merely cumulative of substantially similar, properly admitted evidence, namely, the testimony of Moreno and Daniel Lopez. Commonwealth v. Romero, 555 Pa. 4, 722 A.2d 1014, 1016 (1999).\n. The jury found the following aggravating circumstances: \"[t]he victim was a prosecution witness to a murder or other felony committed by the defendant and was killed for the purpose of preventing his testimony against the defendant in any grand jury or criminal proceeding involving such offensesf,]\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(5); \"[t]he defendant committed a killing while in the perpetration of a felony[,]\" id., \u00a7 9711(d)(6); \"[tjhe defendant has a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person[,]\u201d id., \u00a7 9711(d)(9); and \"[tjhe defendant has been convicted of voluntary manslaughter, as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503 ..., or a substantially equivalent crime in any other jurisdiction, committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue.\u201d Id., \u00a7 971 l(d)(12).\n. Appellant's issues have been reordered for ease of discussion.\n. Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726 (2002) abrogated the rule that ineffectiveness claims based on trial counsel\u2019s performance must be raised at the first opportunity where appellant has new counsel, see Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687 (1977), and instead held a defendant \"should wait to raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel until collateral review.\u201d Grant, at 738. At the time of appellant's trial, direct appeal, and PCRA proceedings, however, Grant was not decided, and therefore, on direct appeal appellant was required to raise his claims of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in order to avoid waiver; having failed to raise them on direct appeal, he was required to layer them by alleging the ineffectiveness of both trial and appellate counsel in his PCRA petition. See Hubbard, at 695 n. 6.\n. An assessment of this prong requires appellant to establish each Pierce prong with respect to trial counsel's performance. This \u201cmerit\u201d prong has been referred to as containing a \"nested\u201d argument-trial counsel's performance must be addressed in order to determine whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue trial counsel's ineffectiveness. See Rush, at 656.\n. The parties disagree regarding whether Puerto Rico has adopted the IAD. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 64 (citing Commonwealth v. Montione, 554 Pa. 121, 720 A.2d 738, 740 (1998) (stating IAD is agreement between 48 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands)); Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 47 n. 27 (arguing Montione\u2019s statement is dicta, based on misstatement in dicta in Carchman v. Nash, 473 U.S. 716, 105 S.Ct. 3401, 87 L.Ed.2d 516 (1985)); see also PCRA Court Opinion, 9/15/00, at 23 (stating Puerto Rico has not adopted IAD). But see Commonwealth v. Williams, 586 Pa. 553, 896 A.2d 523, 536 n. 5 (2006) (IAD is agreement between 48 states, District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Virgin Islands). Because the IAD was not used to bring appellant to Pennsylvania, and in light of the fact that trial was scheduled by mutual consensus, we need not address this conflict.\n. Counsel did request an interpreter to stand by appellant during his penalty phase testimony. N.T. Trial, 3/20/96, at 18-19, 76, 80.\n. Appellant also challenges the veracity of his cellmate, Daniel Lopez\u2019s, testimony. For the same reasons discussed above with respect to the testimony of Moreno and Barbosa, this claim is meritless.\n. Also, with regard to trial counsel's ineffectiveness, this argument is illogical. Although Barbosa recanted his testimony at trial, appellant is primarily arguing Barbosa and Moreno recanted their testimony at the PCRA hearing. Accordingly, trial counsel cannot be ineffective for testimony presented by a witness five years after the trial. The same is true of counsel on direct appeal.\n. The written statement was never introduced into evidence; the cellmate reiterated its contents, having been told not to mention one co-defendant's name when talking about the other. N.T. Trial Vol. IV, 3/12/96, at 132.\n. Lopez raised an identical claim concerning this testimony. See Lopez, at 496-500. This Court, while not specifically ruling on whether the statements violated Bruton, held counsel had a reasonable basis for not objecting to the references to Lopez as \"the other guy,\u201d and Lopez failed to establish he was prejudiced by the admission of the statements. Id., at 498-99. We further held another portion of the testimony to which Lopez objected fell under the admission by party opponent exception to the hearsay rule. Id., at 499. Justice Saylor concurred, joined by then-Justice Zappala and Justice Cappy, noting he would hold the Confrontation Clause was not implicated by the cellmate\u2019s testimony because it was introduced not for its truth, but instead to show fabrication as consciousness of guilt, and as such, was not hearsay. See id., at 505-07 (Saylor, J., concurring).\n. Victim impact evidence is \u201cevidence concerning the victim and the impact that the death of the victim has had on the family of the victim....\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(a)(2). On October 11, 1995, \u00a7 9711(a)(2) was amended to permit victim impact evidence to be admitted in the penalty phase. The amendment, which took effect 60 days thereafter, applies only to sentences imposed for offenses which took place on or after its effective date; thus, at the time of appellant's trial, victim impact evidence was inadmissible during both guilt and penalty phases. See Commonwealth v. Fisher, 545 Pa. 233, 681 A.2d 130, 145-47 (1996).\n. Appellant cites the testimony of the victim\u2019s co-workers, Nancy Miltenberger, Louis Leposa, and Ken Zimmerman; Lorelei Willgruber, who found the victim's wallet; Police Chief Larry Boyer; and Brenda Bolasky, the victim\u2019s wife. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 43.\n. Trial counsel filed a motion to sever, which the trial court denied. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 682.\n. Lopez presented more mitigating evidence than appellant did. Appellant also points to the fact Lopez \"cooperated\" with the police by giving them his statements; however, Lopez\u2019s giving several inconsistent statements, which were later determined to be fabricated, cannot be characterized as cooperation.\n. Furthermore, counsel\u2019s very valid defense strategy was to minimize appellant\u2019s involvement in the crime, see N.T. PCRA Hearing, 5/31/00, at 670; as we noted in Lopez, \"contesting the brutality of the killing would not have furthered this defense, and quarreling over this comment would only highlight it in the jurors\u2019 minds, ,to [appellant\u2019s] detriment.\u201d Lopez, 854 A.2d at 470.\n. \u201cAny other evidence of mitigation concerning the character and record of the defendant and the circumstances of his offense.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8).\n. Recently, the United States Supreme Court upheld a district court\u2019s \"finding that the poor quality of [the defendant's] alleged mitigating evidence prevented him from making 'a colorable claim' of prejudice.\u201d Schriro v. Landrigan, - U.S.----, -, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 1943, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007). In Landrigan, the defendant had instructed counsel not to present any evidence at the penalty phase, but later claimed counsel was ineffective for failing to explore additional mitigating evidence. Id., at 1938. The defendant alleged he was exposed to drugs and alcohol in \u00fatero, abandoned by his birth mother, subjected to his adoptive mother's substance abuse, and began his own substance abuse at an early age; based on his biological family\u2019s history of violence, he claimed he may also have been genetically predisposed to violence. Id., at 1943. In reversing the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 grant of an evidentiary hearing on the defendant's ineffectiveness claim, the Supreme Court noted the defendant\u2019s \"mitigation evidence was weak, and the postconviction court was well acquainted with [his] exceedingly violent past and had seen first hand his belligerent behavior.\u201d Id., at 1944. Quoting the initial Court of Appeals panel, which had affirmed the denial of review, the Supreme Court stated, \" 'On this record, assuring the court that genetics made [the defendant] the way he is could not have been very helpful. There was no prejudice.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Landrigan v. Stewart, 272 F.3d 1221, 1229 (9th Cir.2001)).\nHere, appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim was evaluated at a hearing, and the PCRA court concluded he could not establish prejudice; however, as Landrigan demonstrates, where the alleged mitigating evidence is so weak that it could not have been helpful, no colorable claim of ineffectiveness is established, and a hearing is not required.\n. Cf. Commonwealth v. Malloy, 579 Pa. 425, 856 A.2d 767 (2004) (counsel found ineffective for failing to prepare for penalty phase where he only met with appellant for four hours, introduced no mitigating evidence other than appellant\u2019s age and role as minor participant in crime, counsel\u2019s presentation at penalty phase included no affirmative evidence at all \u2014 only brief argument and stipulation, and Commonwealth only sought one aggravator). In Malloy, we concluded, \"counsel failed to so much as conduct a cursory review of appellant's background[,]\u201d id., at 788, and \"undertook little or no affirmative effort aimed at the penalty phase[,]\" id., at 786; here, in contrast, counsel spent much time interviewing appellant, asked him if his family could be of assistance, spoke to appellant\u2019s sister, and attempted to present appellant as a family-man whose involvement in the crime had been peripheral. Counsel argued two mitigating circumstances, and the Commonwealth sought four aggravators.\n. Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\n. \"The defendant's participation in the homicidal act was relatively minor.\" 42 Pa.C.S \u00a7 9711(e)(7).\n. See also Commonwealth v. Williams, 581 Pa. 57, 863 A.2d 505, 512 n. 8 (2004) (no relief on Lassiter claim where Lassiter was decided after appellant's judgment of sentence became final, and at least one other aggravating circumstance and no mitigating circumstances were found). Cf. Commonwealth v. Markman, 591 Pa. 249, 916 A.2d 586, 612 (2007) (trial court\u2019s failure to give Lassiter instruction erroneous where verdict sheet did not indicate whether finding of guilt was based on principal or accomplice liability, and (d)(6) was only aggravating circumstance presented and proved; however, error harmless in light of trial court\u2019s specific instruction that (d)(6) applied only if \"the defendant committed a killing\u201d during perpetration of felony).\n. Section 4005 provides: \"Any person who acting with negligence or who, in the commission of an unlawful act not amounting to a felony, causes the death of another, shall be punished by imprisonment for a fixed term of one year and eight months.\" 33 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 4005.\n. As of January 1, 2007, the AAMR is now known as the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.\n. At the lime Miller was decided, over three years had passed since Atkins announced each state had to set standards and procedures for adjudicating the mental retardation of a defendant in a capital case; however, although bills had been introduced, no legislation had been passed. See Miller, at 633 (Eakin, J., concurring); see also Miller, at 633 n. 11. To date, legislation concerning this subject has still not been passed, and cases continue to \"languish and courts await action which has not been forthcoming.\u201d Miller, at 633 (Eakin, J., concurring). In this case, regardless of what standard is employed, appellant's claim fails, as he argues he is \"borderline mentally retarded,\u201d which, as discussed infra, is insufficient to warrant relief.\n. The AAMR lists adaptive skills as language and money concepts, responsibility and ability to follow rules, meal preparation, and money management; the APA's DSM-IV Manual requires significant limitation in at least two of the following areas: communication, self-care, home living, social/interpersonal skills, use of community resources, self-direction, functional academic skills, work, leisure, health, and safety. Id., at 630 n. 8."}
