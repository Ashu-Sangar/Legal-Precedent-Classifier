{"id": "582030", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nThis is a direct appeal from the judgments of sentence imposed on David Lipscomb following his conviction by a jury of murder in the first degree and of conspiracy to commit robbery and murder.\nThe prosecution stemmed from the fatal stabbing assault on Edward Sweeney, allegedly committed by Lipscomb and six other young men on a public street in Philadelphia. The assistant district attorney\u2019s argument to the jury violated the rules of proper professional conduct and was of such a prejudicial character as to deny Lipscomb his constitutional right to a fair trial. We will, therefore, order a new trial.\nIn part, the representative of the Commonwealth argued to the jury as follows:\n\u201cYou know, my best witness isn\u2019t here today. But if he could come back, if Mr. Sweeney could come back and sit in this chair and face you, the jurors, I believe he would say, \u2018I didn\u2019t want to die. I was only 59 years of age. I think I had a number of years ahead of me, I didn\u2019t want to die. I was just walking along the street, a friend had been kind enough to give me a little bag of groceries to help me out because I was unemployed at the time, and I was on my way home, walking the route I have walked many, many times from my friend\u2019s house.\n\u201c \u2018I didn\u2019t want to die. I didn\u2019t know this would be my last walk. I didn\u2019t know that a bunch of hoodlums and animals would pounce upon me and tear me apart and would cause my blood to stream out on the sidewalk and beside a tree, on the ice and the water. I tried to save myself. I got up, I tried to put my little belongings in my bag, but I couldn\u2019t get them. But, I walked towards home, the only route I knew for years, and I got to my house and I gave out; I gave out, I ran out of gas, and so I just lay there with my back to the steps and my head resting against it. My friend had given me a couple of Reader\u2019s Digests which I dropped on the steps, filled with blood. I didn\u2019t want to die. Why did I have to die? . . .\u2019\n\u201cAnd I think Mr. Sweeney would say, \u2018The only way you couldn\u2019t find this defendant guilty of murder of the first degree is for me to come alive again before your very eyes and walk out of that door to my home.\u2019 \u201d Defense counsel immediately made a motion for a mistrial which the trial judge refused to grant.\nAs recently as January 24, 1974, this Court expressed its criticism of improper and prejudicial comments by district attorneys. See Commonwealth v. Toth, 455 Pa. 154, 314 A. 2d 275 (1974). See also Commonwealth v. Brooks, 454 Pa. 75, 309 A. 2d 732 (1973); Commonwealth v. Revty, 448 Pa. 512, 295 A. 2d 300 (1972); Commonwealth v. Potter, 445 Pa. 284, 285 A. 2d 492 (1971); and Commonwealth v. Clark, 322 Pa. 321, 185 A. 764 (1936). The instant case falls directly in line with these decisions. The foregoing argument exceeded the bounds of propriety and constituted an appeal to the passions and prejudices of the jury. Moreover, in testifying as if his \u201cbest witness\u201d Mr. Sweeney, was in the courtroom, that which followed amounted to the giving of testimony by an unsworn witness. See Commonwealth v. Clark, supra. In referring to Lipscomb and his alleged associates by the epithets of \u201choodlums\u201d and \u201canimals\u201d, the assistant district attorney interjected his personal belief in the guilt of the accused. Such \u201cexpressions of personal belief . . . have no legitimate place in a district attorney\u2019s argument.\u201d Commonwealth v. Capalla, 322 Pa. 200, 206, 185 A. 203, 206 (1936). As stated in Capalla: \u201cIt is no part of a district attorney\u2019s duty, and it is not his right, to stigmatize a defendant. He has a right to argue that the evidence proves the defendant guilty as charged in the indictment but for the district attorney himself to characterize the defendant as \u2018a coldblooded killer\u2019 is something quite different. No man on trial for murder can be officially characterized as a murderer or as \u2018a cold-blooded killer,\u2019 until he is adjudged guilty of murder or pleads guilty to that charge.\u201d [Emphasis supplied.] Id. at 204, 185 A. at 205. See also Commonwealth v. Toth, supra; Commonwealth v. Williams, 309 Pa. 529, 164 A. 532 (1932); Commonwealth v. Shoemaker, 240 Pa. 255, 87 A. 684 (1913); Commonwealth v. Bubnis, 197 Pa. 542, 47 A. 748 (1901). Cf. Hall v. United States, 419 F. 2d 582, 587 (5th Cir. 1969). Further, in conjunction with the characterization of \u201choodlum\u201d and \u201canimal\u201d, the prosecution\u2019s comment that, \u201cI think Mr. Sweeney would say, \u2018The only way you couldn\u2019t find this defendant guilty of murder of the first degree is for me to come alive again before your very eyes\u2019 \u201d amounts to a statement by the prosecutor that in effect he is personally convinced that the appellant is guilty, and his innocence is as unlikely as the resurrection of the deceased. Such personal assertions by a district attorney on the guilt of the accused is beyond the scope of fair play, and is emphatically condemned. See Commonwealth v. Capalla., supra. See also U.S. v. Schartner, 426 F. 2d 470 (3d Cir. 1970). In Capalla, this Court discussed the district attorney\u2019s characterization of the accused as \u201ca cold-blooded killer.\u201d We stated the statement \u201cwas equivalent to an expression of belief on the part of the district attorney that the defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree. There are no facts in the record warranting any such belief on the part of anyone, and even if there were, the first officials who had the right to give expression to that belief were the jurors after the case was committed to their keeping.\u201d Id. at 205-206, 185 A. at 206.\nAnother portion of the assistant district attorney\u2019s argument was also improper and unwarranted.\nAs part of his defense, Lipscomb called four witnesses, including a former school teacher, to testify to his previous good reputation. The Commonwealth offered no evidence to refute this testimony; however, during his summation the assistant district attorney argued thusly:\n\u201cMy only question, the only question, I want to ask you is, Where is this minister? Where is the defendant\u2019s minister or his priest? Where are the neighbors in the area in which he has lived before Evans School or after Evans School who could come in and say, \u2018I have known this boy, I watched him grow up for 16 or 17 years, 8 years, whatever it is, and I know his reputation is good in the community.\u2019 That is the way you test reputation evidence. You ask them how long they have known the defendant. Do you know other people in the community who know the defendant? Among those people in the community whom you know, who knows the defendant, what is his reputation for being a peaceful, law-abiding citizen or whatever it is?\n\u201cWell if you\u2019ve never asked the people in the community what his reputation is, you can\u2019t know what his reputation in the community is. It\u2019s not what you think of him, it\u2019s what other people in the community think of him. And there\u2019s no one here brought in from his community at any time who said that this defendant had a good reputation in the community in which he lived. No one except his mother, his father and his girl friend.\u201d\nThere is no burden on a criminal defendant to establish his previous good reputation. If he fails to introduce testimony in this regard, no adverse influence may be drawn therefrom, nor may such an adverse inference be drawn merely because only a limited number of witnesses were called to testify as to the good reputation of the accused. And, by the same token, no such adverse inference may be drawn merely because the accused failed to call some particular individual as a character witness. The assistant district attorney asked the jury to do just that. His argument was much more than just an attack on the quality of the character testimony offered by Lipscomb\u2014as the Commonwealth contends.\nJudgments reversed, and a new trial is ordered.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nThe jury fixed life imprisonment as the punishment to be imposed on the murder conviction, and the sentence was in accordance with this directive. The court imposed a concurrent two-year prison sentence on the conspiracy conviction.\nThe trial judge did not instruct the jury to disregard this argument of the assistant district attorney, nor did he refer to it in his charge.\nThe American Bar Association project on Standards for Criminal Justice also condemns such conduct:\n\u201c5.8 Argument to the jury\n\u201c(a) The prosecutor may argue all reasonable inferences from evidence in the record. It is unprofessional conduct for the prosecutor intentionally to misstate the evidence or mislead the jury as to the inferences it may draw.\n\u201c(b) It is unprofessional conduct for the prosecutor to express his personal belief or opinion as to the truth or falsity of any testimony or evidence of the guilt of the defendant ....\n\u201c5.9 Facts outside the record\n\u201cIt is unprofessional conduct for the prosecutor intentionally to refer to or argue on the basis of facts outside the record whether at trial or on appeal . . . .\u201d A.B.A. Standards, The Prosecution and Defense Functions, at 126-29."}
