{"id": "967936", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe appellant\u2019s title to retain possession was founded on his status as mortgagee, but the learned judge below having found that appellant was not in possession by virtue of the mortgage but as a tenant under an express contract of lease, the title set up in the bill was not made out and the bill was properly dismissed. We have not been convinced that the finding was erroneous.\nDecree affirmed."}
