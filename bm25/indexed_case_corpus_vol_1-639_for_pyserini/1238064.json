{"id": "1238064", "contents": "Opinion bx\nMs. Justice Arnold,\nOn preliminary objections the court below dismissed the plaintiff\u2019s bill in equity and she appeals.\nAt the instance of the wife the bill, in plain language, seeks to enjoin her husband, Leonard Diamond, from committing adultery with Gussie Stein, and also to restrain Dorothy Lerner, who is alleged to have been an aider and abettor of the principal defendant\u2019s acts.\nWhile it may be convenient to restrain the errant spouse, nevertheless it is without authority under the law of Pennsylvania.\nIn the first place, equity will not enjoin the commission of a crime: Commonwealth v. Smith, 266 Pa. 511, 109 A. 786, 9 A.L.E. 922. In the second place, courts of equity in Pennsylvania are concerned only where property rights are involved. See Heasley v. Operative Plasterers & Cement Finishers International Association, Local No. 31, 324 Pa. 257, 188 A. 206; Kenneck v. Pennock, 305 Pa. 288, 157 A. 613; Ashinsky v. Levenson, 256 Pa. 14, 100 A. 491.\nThe order of the court below sustaining preliminary objections and dismissing the bill, is affirmed; appellant to pay the costs."}
