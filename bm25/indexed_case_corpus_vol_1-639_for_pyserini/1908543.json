{"id": "1908543", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nOn April 11, 1966, appellant, Stanley Howard, with the advice of counsel, entered a plea of guilty generally to an indictment for murder in the death of Clifford Grogan. After a hearing, wherein extensive testimony was taken and documentary evidence was reviewed, the court en banc fixed the degree of guilt as murder in the first degree and imposed the death penalty. The appellant filed a motion in arrest of judgment and, after submission of briefs and oral argument, the court, on October 25, 1966, by its opinion and order, denied the motion. On November 2, 1966, the death sentence was formally announced in open court, where appellant, with counsel, was present. This appeal followed.\nOn November 12, 1965, at approximately 3:30 P.M., Lorance J. Weyandt, a lieutenant of the guards, was standing in the yard of the Western State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh conversing with another guard, John Fred Walz. Suddenly and without warning, someone came up behind Weyandt, and he received what he described as \u201ca hard blow in the back\u201d. He wheeled around and confronted Stanley Howard, the appellant, who was then an inmate at that institution. Howard was facing him with a knife in his right hand. Howard advanced toward Weyandt, and Weyandt began backing away. Howard then swung the knife and, with a sweeping motion, struck the officer in the chest. Walz ran over to assist Weyandt and the appellant, Howard, turned upon him, cursing, and shouted \u201cDo you want it too?\u201d. Walz ran to obtain assistance. Weyandt continued backing away, holding his hands in front of him. At this point, tradesmen instructor Clifford Grogan came on the scene and approached Howard from behind. Just before Grogan was able to seize the appellant, Howard spun sideways and struck at Grogan with the knife. Grogan jumped backward, attempting to avoid the thrust, and in doing so, fell to the ground. He kicked out at the appellant and in the same motion rolled over onto his right side. Appellant, Howard, thereupon stabbed Grogan in the left side. Howard then stepped over his victim in a straddling position and, while Grogan was on his hands and knees and Howard was straddling him across the hips, Howard proceeded to stab Grogan twice in the right side.\nBy this time, other guards rushed to the scene and Howard was seized, subdued, and disarmed. It was at this point that Weyandt discovered that the blow which he had felt in his back had been a stab wound inflicted by the appellant. Weyandt recovered from this stab wound, but Grogan died shortly thereafter from the stab wounds which he had received.\nInterrogation of Weyandt at trial revealed that he had had no personal contact with the appellant which would have resulted in any animosity between them. Officer Weyandt further indicated at the trial that from the time he felt the pain in his back until he saw Grogan attempting to restrain Howard was only a matter of seconds. Weyandt further indicated at the preliminary hearing that the demeanor of the appellant was that of someone who was mad or angry. There is no evidence to indicate that Grogan was ever known by Howard.\nThe history of Stanley Howard is very well covered by the court below as follows:\n\u201cStanley Howard was born on May 18, 1939, in New Jersey, the youngest of six children. In November, 1943, following the breakup of his parents\u2019 marriage, he was placed in a foster home, under the care of a Mrs. Halsey. In January, 1944, Mrs. Halsey reported that he was \u2018misbehaving\u2019 and that she could not handle him, and he was therefore placed with a Mrs. Gilbert. In October, 1947, it is reported that Howard was stealing from Mrs. Gilbert\u2019s grandson. In December, 1948, Howard was reported annoying an elderly man on the way to school. In February, 1949, he is reported to have been a school problem, and in July, 1949, he climbed out of a school bus and ran away. In August, 1949, he was reported to have been dumping garbage cans into the hallways of apartment buildings adjacent to his own. By the end of 1949, Mrs. Gilbert reported that he was constantly staying out late and running around and that she was unable to handle him. In January, 1950, he was placed in the home of a Mrs. Ford. She reported that he lied to her as to his activities, stayed out late, and was a disciplinary problem.\n\u201cIn April, 1950, he was placed in the home of a Mrs. Dumas. On July 10, 1950, he broke the window of a bakery shop, and on October 24, 1950, he broke a number of windows at school. Finally, in October, 1951, Mrs. Dumas reported that Howard had run away for a week-end, had committed thefts from her, and that she was unable to control him. On November 1, 1951, a Juvenile Court hearing was held, involving the thefts from Mrs. Dumas. Howard was placed on one year\u2019s probation and placed in an institutional home. He was, at this time, 12 years old.\n\u201cIn January, 1952, he was placed with his mother, who it appears, was living in Philadelphia in an adulterous relationship.\n\u201cWithin a relatively short time, Howard was arrested for aggravated assault and battery, and sent to the Glen Mills School. He adjusted poorly at Glen Mills, and was transferred to the State Correctional Institution at Camp Hill in 1954, where he remained until 1958. He returned to living with his mother until 1960 when he enlisted in the Army.\n\u201cWhile in the service, he was court-martialed four times and was given an undesirable discharge in August, 1961. He once again returned to Philadelphia and resided with his mother.\n\u201cIn April, 1962, Howard was convicted of aggravated assault and battery and sentenced to 6 to 22 months. On October 14, 1962, he was paroled.\n\u201cOn November 3, 1962, he broke into a home in Philadelphia, stole money and jewelry, and raped the woman occupant. The victim\u2019s husband returned while Howard was still present, and a struggle ensued, with Howard inflicting a cutting upon the husband and escaping.\n\u201cOn November 23, 1962, he robbed a grocery store and physically assaulted the woman proprietor with his fists.\n\u201cOn December 15, 1962, and again on December 22, 1962, he committed robberies while armed with a rifle, and on December 25, 1962, he robbed a taproom while armed with a shotgun.\n\u201cHoward was apprehended on December 26, 1962. He pleaded guilty and, following a hearing on February 14, 1963, was sentenced to a total of 30 to 60 years in prison.\n\u201cHe was sent initially to the State Correctional Institution at Graterford. His record there indicates a number of disciplinary offenses. In June, 1964, he was twice admitted to the hospital following apparent suicide attempts, once by cutting his forearms and the other by attempted hanging by his bedsheet.\n\u201cHe was transferred to the Eastern State Correctional Institution at Philadelphia on July 14, 1964. On August 25, 1965, Howard attacked an inmate named Murphy with a knife, for which he was tried and received an additional 1 to 2 year sentence. As a result of this attack, he was transferred to the State Correctional Institution at Pittsburgh on March 31, 1965.\n\u201cUpon reception at the State Correctional' Institution at Pittsburgh, he was placed in administrative segregation for observation and thereafter was released into the general prison population on May 3, 1965.\n\u201cOn July 2, 1965, he was charged with refusing to be searched and threatening an officer, and as a result was returned to administrative segregation. On July 9, 1965, while confined to segregation, he attacked an inmate named Joseph Weaver with a lock wrapped in a sock, as a result of which Weaver was hospitalized, and Howard was placed in punitive segregation. He was finally released from segregation on November 8, 1965. Four days later, on November 12, 1965, the attack upon Weyandt and the killing of Grogan occurred.\n\u201cOn February 21, 1966, Howard physically attacked his court-appointed attorney who was in the process of consulting with Howard in his cell.\u201d\nThe court below, in its opinion, discusses the psychiatric evaluation of the appellant upon his arrival at the Eastern State Correctional Institution, where he was examined by Dr. Melvin S. Heller, a psychiatrist. Dr. Heller classified appellant\u2019s problem as \u201ca long-standing character disorder of the dissocial type, manifested by a long history of anti-social behavior, inability to profit from experience, and a lack of capacity to form meaningful emotional relationships.\u201d In spite of appellant\u2019s record of suicidal attempts at Graterford, Dr. Heller was of the opinion that appellant did not present a significant suicide risk and recommended that he be placed in the prison population. Dr. Heller\u2019s second report on October 1? 1964, followed an apparent suicide attempt. At that time, he stated: \u201cIt would appear that this suicidal attempt was a superficial one, as was the original one he made at Graterford . . At this time, Dr. Heller reiterated his previous evaluation of Howard and found him unable to respond to disciplinary relationship except for the briefest periods of time. On October 20, 1964, appellant was examined by Dr. 0. Fred Hering, a psychiatrist, following an episode of bizarre behavior and a suicidal attempt on October 2, 1964, supposedly a severe reaction to the long sentence which had been ' imposed. Dr. Hering stated: \u201cThis man was admitted to 3 Block . . . following an episode of bizzarre [sic] behavior on 15 Block, where he had been sent following a suicidal attempt. . . . This seemed to be a very severe reaction to the fact that he had a 30 to 60 year sentence and feels he has nothing to lose. However, it was pointed out to him that he has a lot to gain with behavior which would be more productive and constructive for him; that there is an opportunity for him to learn many things, both about himself as well as vocationally and educationally, here in the institution. He seems somewhat impressed by this.\u201d\nThe instant killing occurred on November 12, 1965. However, appellant was not indicted until December of 1965, and early in January of 1966, he was brought to court for the appointment of public counsel or the opportunity to obtain private counsel. On January 17, 1966, he corresponded with the newly-created office of the Public Defender, requesting counsel, and counsel was formally appointed on February 1, 1966. On February 21, 1966,. upon the application of the office of the public defender, Dr. Emil Trellis, a psychiatrist, and Dr. Leon I. Ford, a clinical psychologist, were appointed to examine appellant. On March 5, 1966, Dr. Ford examined the appellant for approximately 4 hours. This examination included testing and an interview with appellant at great length. Dr. Ford observed: \u201c. . . He seems equally inclined to take direct action, often in an impulsive manner, to avoid or to obtain release from tension. Most of the time he reacts on a reality basis, bnt he has the potential for sudden emotional eruptions on the basis of inner promptings with little regard for external reality. . . . When his defenses are lowered under great stress he can be overwhelmed by intense mixed moody and angry feelings and destructive impulses. . . .\n\u201cPsychological tests reveal Mr. Howard to be extremely immature and self-centered person who views the world as extremely hostile and unpleasant. He has many deep-seated fears and conflicts and an extremely low tolerance for frustration and anxiety. Passivity, fantasy, projection and counter-phobic defenses are insufficient to contain his anxiety, and he avoids and relieves tension by direct and often impulsive action. Assultive [sic] tendencies are easily elicited especially when he feels threatened. Generally, he is quite reality oriented, but he has occasional lapses when his thinking is illogical and disordered.\u201d\nHe concluded as follows: \u201cThe eneuresis (bed-wetting), anti-social behavior, impulsive assaultiveness towards self and others, and the psychological test results indicating emotional conflicts, illogical thinking and the potential for impulsive behavior with little regard for reality all suggest a borderline psychosis or transient psychotic episodes in an impulsive character disordered personality.\u201d\nIn his direct examination at trial, Dr. Ford described appellant as thinking concretely, meaning that he attempted to act to immediate things instead of stopping to think what the consequences of such acts might be. He indicated that Howard had inadequate counter-phobic defenses, indicating that appellant tended to become more aggressive to counteract his fears. The suggestion of transient psychotic episodes was supported by the effects upon appellant of his being isolated and the occasional lapses which occurred in the process of psychological testing. Dr. Ford\u2019s testimony also revealed, in his opinion, it would have been better had appellant been tested soon after the crime, depending upon his condition, and that it would have been worth the attempt to try to determine appellant\u2019s state of mind at the time the offense was committed.\nIn direct examination, Dr. Ford defined \u201cpsychosis\u201d as follows: \u201cPsychosis, generally speaking, is a condition in which the person is emotionally disturbed. In other words, they don\u2019t react to things as other people do. They might see a situation differently than other people see a situation. . . . They might react in such a way that it is entirely unrealistic, . . .\u201d\nAs to \u201ctransient psychotic episodes\u201d, Dr. Ford explained : \u201cBy this I mean that under great stress a person can go into one of these psychotic episodes. It doesn\u2019t mean that they are like this all the time. It would happen when they are under particular kinds of stress. ... It can be inner stress. It could be external, it could be inner, it could be both.\u201d\nDr. Ford classified appellant as a sociopathic personality, defined as follows: \u201cThe sociopathic personality essentially is someone who from very early in life has had very few, if any, close personal relationships with people of longlasting nature, and as a result they tend to be very shallow, very superficial in the way they form friendships. They are really too immature socially and emotionally to really form friendships, real friendships, as most people do. They, of course, seem to be self-centered and primarily concerned with self-preservation and frequently may get into all sorts of difficulties with the law and with people in managing to survive as the only way they know how. They haven\u2019t been disciplined enough as children and really never developed a strong conscience, as the average person does who has more stable family relationships. Essentially, that\u2019s about it . . .\u201d\nDr. Ford went on to state that sociopaths do not normally adjust well to long periods of confinement, and that possibly long periods of confinement could lead to further anti-social acts. He stated that sociopathic personalities are mentally ill, and that in his opinion, Stanley Howard was mentally ill. When questioned as to his being treated for his illness, he replied: \u201cThat\u2019s a difficult question. People have been trying to treat sociopaths and people who are mentally ill like Stanley for many years, with some success and with some failures. I would say more failures than successes.\u201d\nDr. Emil Trellis first examined Stanley Howard on March 3, 1966, and again on April 1, 1966. IDs testimony revealed that he had studied the tests given to Howard by Dr. Ford, and after examining Howard\u2019s tests, diagnosed him as \u201cemotionally unstable personality with schizoid features. . . \u201d. He quoted the definition of Emotionally Unstable Personality from the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of the American Psychiatric Association as follows: \u201cIn such cases the individual reacts with excitability and ineffectiveness when confronted by minor stress. His judgment may be undependable under stress, and his relationship to other people is continuously fraught with fluctuating emotional attitudes, because of strong and poorly controlled hostility, guilt, and anxiety.\n\u201cThis term is synonymous with the former term psychopathic personality with emotional instability.\u201d\nHe found that Howard showed hints of schizophrenic features, although Howard was not schizophrenic. He testified that the sociopatliie person \u201ctends to be impulsive; hence not to be able to have the judgment or control of impulses to delay immediate action with the idea that they have to have consequences for their behavior. The sociopath does not readily learn from experience. The sociopath in general isn\u2019t able to have the controls to develop a sustained kind of occupational skill in many cases.\u201d Dr. Trellis also stated that, in his opinion, Howard was not legally insane.\nWe said in Commonwealth v. Green, 396 Pa. 137, 151 A. 2d 241 (1959) : \u201cOur scope of review is limited: we simply determine whether the court below in its imposition of the death penalty upon Green abused its discretion.\n\u201cIn Com. v. Taranow, 359 Pa. 342, 344, 345, 59 A. 2d 53, this Court, speaking through Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Jones, stated: \u2018The Act of 1939, supra, specifically provides that \u201cIn cases of pleas of guilty, the court, where it determines the crime to be murder of the first degree, shall, at its discretion, impose sentence of death or imprisonment for life\u201d. (Emphasis supplied). The extent of our function in the premises is merely to review for a possible abuse of the discretion so reposed in the trial court: Commonwealth v. Hough, 358 Pa. 247, 250, 56 A. 2d 84. \u201cThe point for consideration [on appeal] is not whether this Court would have imposed the death penalty but whether the discretion vested in the court below was judicially exercised, . . .\u201d Commonwealth v. Howell, 338 Pa. 577, 580, 13 A. 2d 531.\u2019 \u201d\nAs we said in Commonwealth v. Cater, 402 Pa. 48, 55, 166 A. 2d 44 (1960) : \u201cIn determining whether the court below abused its discretion in the imposition of the death sentences we must bear in mind that while the discretion exercised by a trial court in the imposition of the death penalty, after a plea of guilty and a finding of murder in the first degree, is subject to our appellate review, yet on such review the question before us is not whether we would have imposed the same penalty under the circumstances but whether the trial court manifestly abused the discretion imposed upon it by the legislature: [citing cases]:\u201d\nIn the instant case, appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to establish that this was a killing with premeditation and deliberation. We believe this contention to be without merit. The appellant entered a plea of guilty to murder generally, and after the three-judge court heard all the evidence, the crime was fixed at murder in the first degree, and appellant was sentenced to death. The Penal Code of 1939, Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, \u00a7701, 18 P.S. \u00a74701 provides: \u201cOffenses Against the Person. Section 701. Murder of the First and Second Degree. \u2014 -All murder which shall be perpetrated by means of poison, or by lying in wait, or by any other kind of willful, deliberate and premeditated killing, . . . shall be murder in the first degree. All other kinds of murder shall be murder in the second degree.\u201d\nWe said, in Commonwealth v. Tyrrell, 405 Pa. 210, 212, 174 A. 2d 852 (1961) : \u201cThe distinguishing criterion or hallmark of murder is legal malice, express or implied. Malice is an absolutely essential ingredient of murder, [citing cases] The essential difference in a nonfelony murder-killing between murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree is that murder in the first degree requires a specific intent to take the life of another human being: [citing cases].\u201d\nIn Commonwealth v. Ballem, 386 Pa. 20, 26, 123 A. 2d 728 (1956), we said: \u201cIndeed, the jury could have found a specific intent to kill and therefore first degree murder from The offender\u2019s use of a deadly weapon, for while an intention to kill may be shown by the defendant\u2019s express words or declarations or other conduct, such intent may be just as effectively inferred from the deliberate use of a deadly weapon npon a vital part for a manifest purpose: [citing cases].\u2019 \u201d\nIn the instant case, appellant\u2019s use of a deadly weapon and his acts, committed in the presence of others, were more than sufficient for the court to find appellant guilty of murder in the first degree. The action of appellant supplies specific intent, willfulness, deliberation and premeditation essential for a determination of murder in the first degree. For example, in Commonwealth v. Millien, 291 Pa. 291, 295, 139 A. 851 (1927), it was held to be proper to admit evidence showing the number of shots fired by the defendant. As we said in Commonwealth v. Tyrrell, supra, \u201cA criminal\u2019s intent, like the commission of a crime and the identity of the criminal, can be found by a jury or Judge from a consideration of the defendant\u2019s act, his words and his actions \u2014 not only at the time of the commission of the crime but also, when relevant, prior and subsequent thereto \u2014 in other words, from all relevant facts and circumstances and all reasonable inferences therefrom.\u201d In Commonwealth v. Carroll, 412 Pa. 525, 532, 194 A. 2d 911 (1963), this court, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Bell, stated: \u201cThe specific intent to kill which is necessary to constitute in a nonfelony murder, murder in the first degree, may be found from a defendant\u2019s words or conduct or from the attendant circumstances together with all reasonable inferences therefrom, and may be inferred from the intentional use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body of another human being: [citing cases].\u201d\nIn the instant case, where appellant made an unprovoked attack from the rear with a deadly weapon on a vital area of a prison guard; where he continued to strike at the unarmed guard with the weapon; and where he stabbed to death another unarmed man who was attempting to assist the guard, we find that the trial court was fully justified in making a finding of first degree murder.\nAppellant further contends that the death penalty is not justified because of appellant\u2019s history, which has been set out previously, and particularly because an exhaustive inquiry was precluded by the failure of the prison authorities to give appellant a mental examination immediately after the offense. Appellant further contends that this failure to give him a prompt medical examination was a denial of his constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, and prevented an effective inquiry into the defense of insanity. We find these contentions also to be without merit. We are aware that the psychiatrist and psychologist who testified on behalf of appellant both indicated it would have been desirable had appellant received an earlier mental examination; that is, shortly after the time the crime was committed. We are of the opinion that this would have been a desirable thing, and perhaps had the prison authorities had it to do over again, would have had such a mental examination conducted. However, we do not find that their failure to do so supports the contention as set forth by appellant. Nor do we find it mandatory that a defendant be given a mental examination on the spot. As we said in Commonwealth v. Melton, 406 Pa. 348, 356, 178 A. 2d 728 (1962): \u201cThe reports and opinions of psychiatrists and psychologists should be considered by the trial Court, together with all the other facts and evidence, but such reports and opinions are in no way controlling, and neither a jury nor a trial Court has to believe or give complete credence or any credence whatever to the opinion of the psychologists and of psychiatrists: [citing cases].\u201d\nAppellant\u2019s last contention is that the court\u2019s imposition of the death sentence was an abuse of discretion because the record disclosed appellant\u2019s mental illness at the time of the offense and for some time prior thereto, and that the imposition of this death sentence would constitute a cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Federal and State Constitutions. We find this contention to be without merit. As we said in Commonwealth v. Smith, 405 Pa. 456, 459, 176 A. 2d 619 (1962) : \u201cThis Court has sustained a verdict of first degree murder with penalty of death where defendant allegedly had an irresistible impulse, was a moron or a mental defective or a sexual pervert or a psychopathic personality, or had been previously confined in the hospital for the criminal insane for 14 years, or was a schizophrenic psychopath or was an unstable, mentally defective moron, or was feeble-minded: [citing cases].\u201d We conclude, therefore, that appellant in the instant case received a fair hearing; that the evidence was more than sufficient for the court below to find appellant guilty of murder in the first degree. We further find the court below did properly and most thoroughly consider appellant\u2019s background, and that background, coupled with the testimony of both the psychiatrist and psychologist, was considered most properly by the court below in reaching its decision. We further find that under the scope of our review as has been previously set forth, the court below did not abuse its discretion in finding appellant guilty of murder in the first degree and in sentencing him to death.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Jones concurs in the result."}
