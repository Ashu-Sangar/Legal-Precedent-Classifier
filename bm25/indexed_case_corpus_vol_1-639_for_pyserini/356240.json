{"id": "356240", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Chief Justice.\nThe issue in this case is whether a possessor of land should be liable for injuries sustained by a police officer when the officer enters the land with no notice to the possessor in order to perform a police function not related to the land on which the injury occurred.\nOn August 25, 1992 Nicholas Rossino was a police officer employed by Haverford Township, Pennsylvania. At about 10:30 p.m. on August 25, 1992 he was part of a team engaged in serving a warrant on a suspected drug house at 711 Haverford Road. The assignment of Rossino\u2019s team was to secure the rear of the building while other officers went in the front. In order to accomplish this task, he and others crossed the vacant lot at 705 Haverford Road. While crossing this lot, Rossino alleges that he tripped on old chicken wire fencing that was obscured by weeds, and struck his knees on concrete blocks, seriously injuring himself.\nIt is undisputed that although the raid on the suspected drug house was planned in advance, no one representing the police department contacted the owners or possessors of the property at 705 Haverford Road to request permission to enter the property.\n711 Haverford Road, the target of the police raid, is adjacent to 705 and 701 Haverford Road. At the time of the accident, Bela and Martha Kovacs owned the properties at 705 and 701 Haverford Road. Titter Construction Co. had entered into an agreement with the Kovacs to demolish the building located at 705 Haverford Road and to construct a parking lot in its place. When Rossino was injured, Titter\u2019s subcontractor Main Line Paving Company, Inc. had demolished the building at 705 Haverford Road and had filled in the basement. Permits had been issued for additional construction work. At the time of the accident, the properties at 701 and 705 Haverford Road were unsecured and unmarked construction sites.\nIn February of 1994 the Rossinos filed a complaint seeking recovery for personal injuries sustained by Officer Rossino during the drug raid. The Kovaks and Titter Construction filed motions for summary judgment. Their theory was that Rossino was a trespasser and that the appellees had breached no duty which was owing to a trespasser, viz., to refrain from wanton and willful conduct. Rossino contended that he was a licensee and not a trespasser and that the appellees, therefore, had a higher duty of care than that applicable to a trespasser. The trial court granted the appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Rossino was in fact a trespasser and that the appellees had not breached any duty toward him.\nOn appeal, the Superior Court affirmed. The court determined that Rossino was on the Kovaks\u2019 property in order to aid the execution of a search warrant, that he had not obtained the Kovaks\u2019 permission to be there, and he was not on the property at the request of the Kovaks or to aid anyone on their property. On these facts, the Superior Court held that Rossino was a trespasser at the time of his injury and that no appellee had violated any duty owed a trespasser. The motion for summary judgment was, therefore, in the view of the Superior Court, properly granted.\nWe granted allocatur.\nThe gravamen of Rossino\u2019s claim is that because he was a police officer, his status, pursuant to a privilege, should be that of licensee. Rossino concedes that if he was a trespasser at the time of his injury, the duty of the landowner or possessor was merely to refrain from willful or wanton misconduct resulting in injury. He asserts, however, that as a licensee, the duty of the landowner or possessor was to warn him of dangerous hidden conditions on the land that he knew or should have known existed. As Rossino puts it:\nWhy shouldn\u2019t property owners always have a reasonable expectation that police or firefighters may enter onto their property to protect their interests or that of an adjacent property? Why shouldn\u2019t property owners warn of dangerous conditions on their property when they expect protection from our public servants.\nBrief at 8.\nIn Pennsylvania, a trespasser may recover for injuries sustained on land only if the possessor of land was guilty of wanton or willful negligence or misconduct. Engel v. Parkway Company, 439 Pa. 559, 266 A.2d 685 (Pa.1970). The Restatement of Torts (Second) defines a trespasser as \u201ca person who enters or remains upon land in the possession of another without a privilege to do so created by the possessor\u2019s consent or otherwise.\u201d \u00a7 329 (1965).\nA licensee, on the other hand is \u201ca person who is privileged to enter or remain on land only by virtue of the possessor\u2019s consent.\u201d Restatement of Torts (Second) \u00a7 330 (1965). Accord, Cutler v. Peck Lumber Mfg. Co., 350 Pa. 8, 37 A.2d 739, 740 (Pa.1944), citing the Restatement of Torts, \u00a7 340. As stated in Cutler,\nA possessor of land is not subject to liability to his licensees, whether business visitors or gratuitous licensees, for bodily harm caused to them by any dangerous condition thereon, whether natural or artificial, if they know of the condition and realize the risk involved therein.\n37 A.2d at 740, citing Restatement of Torts \u00a7 340. The current Restatement revises this statement of liability slightly:\n\u00a7 342. Dangerous conditions Known to Possessor\nA possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to licensees by a condition on the land if, but only if,\n(a) the possessor knows or has reason to know of the condition and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such licensees, and should expect that they will not discover or realize the danger, and\n(b) he fails to exercise reasonable care to make the condition safe, or to warn the licensees of the condition and the risk involved, and\n(c) the licensees do not know or have reason to know of the condition and the risk involved.\nRestatement of Torts (Second) \u00a7 342.\nRossino\u2019s complaint alleges that the appellees acted negligently. There is no allegation that the appellees acted willfully or wantonly. Therefore, if the lower courts were correct in ruling that Rossino was a trespasser on the Kovaks\u2019 land, the motion for summary judgment was properly sustained, for the complaint fails to make allegations which, if true, would justify liability against the appellees and in favor of a trespasser.\nThe real question in the case is whether Rossino was a trespasser or a licensee at the time of the accident. Comment a to Section 329 (Trespasser defined) states:\na. One may be privileged to enter land in the possession of another without the possessor\u2019s consent for the purpose of advancing or protecting his own private interests or those of the public, as when he enters to take possession of his boat wrecked upon the possessor\u2019s foreshore or enters in pursuit of a felon. As to the possessor\u2019s duty toward persons entering in the exercise of such privileges, see \u00a7 345.\nSection 345 then sets out the liability of possessors of land to those entering pursuant to a privilege:\n... the liability of a possessor of land to one who enters the land only in the exercise of a privilege, for either a public or a private purpose, and irrespective of the possessor\u2019s consent, is the same as the liability to a licensee.\nHowever, comment (d) states:\nIn order for the possessor to be liable under the rule stated in this Section for failure to warn a person who enters under a privilege ... the possessor must know or have reason to anticipate that the visitor is upon the land or will enter in the exercise of his privilege, and that he will be endangered by the condition.\nRestatement of Torts (Second) \u00a7 345, Comment (d).\nAlthough this court has never adopted Section 345, and we decline to do so now, we agree with the principle that in order for a possessor of land to be liable to a trespasser entering pursuant to a privilege, the possessor must know or have reason to anticipate that the trespasser is or may be on the land in the exercise of his privilege and that he will be endangered by the state of the land. Thus, Rossino does not qualify as a licensee under any rationale, for the possessors had no knowledge or reason to know that the police were on their land.\nIt remains only to consider whether, the Restatement of Torts notwithstanding, Rossino should, on the facts of this case, be granted the status of a licensee. We think not. If the appellees in this case were hable, every possessor of land in the Commonwealth, no matter how remote the location, would face civil liability every time police or firemen entered his land if he knew or had reason to know of a dangerous condition on his land, expected that a police officer would not discover or realize the danger, and he did not take steps to make the condition safe or warn of the condition. To guard against this liability, the landowner would have to scour his property, however large or wild, for conditions of any sort which might go undetected by a person unfamiliar with the land and either correct these conditions or warn against them. We regard such a result as absurd and the implications for landowners unacceptable.\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nCASTILLE, J., files a dissenting opinion in which NEWMAN, J., joins.\n.
