{"id": "1047431", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe only question before the referee and the compensation board, which was one of fact, was as to the relation which the husband of the appellee sustained to the appellant at the time he was killed. The finding of the board was that he was an employee, and not an independent contractor, as the defendant contended. This finding is conclusive: Messinger v. Lehigh Valley E. B. Co., 261 Pa. 336.\nAppeal dismissed and award affirmed."}
