{"id": "827888", "contents": "Opinion,\nMr. Chief Justice Paxson:\nThe learned judge below evidently mistook what was, at most, a trespass, for malicious mischief. The defendants were indicted under the act of March 23, 1865, which provides:\n\u201c That if any person or persons, from and after the passage of this act, shall maliciously or wantonly break or throw down any post and rail or other fence erected for the enclosure of land, or shall carry away, break, or destroy any post, rail, or other material of which such fence was built, enclosing any lots or fields within the commonwealth, such person or persons so offending shall be guilty of a misdemeanor,\u201d etc.\nUpon the trial below, the defendant Ellen Drass being on the stand, the defence offered to prove by her \u201c that they the defendants did not tear or take down the fence wantonly, nor wilfully, nor maliciously; but in justification of their right to go out and in on their own property.\u201d The second specification discloses a somewhat similar offer. The learned district attorney objected to the admission of this evidence, on the ground \u201c that evidence of justification cannot be admitted, the defendants not undertaking to deny the offence as made out bj\u2019 the commonwealth\u2019s witnesses ; in fact, admitting it by their offer to justify.\u201d The learned judge sustained the objection.\nI do not understand the offer to admit the commonwealth\u2019s case. It admits the taking down of the fence, but it does not admit that it was done \u201c maliciously or wantonly,\u201d which was the gist of the commonwealth\u2019s case. The mere act of tearing down a fence is not necessarily malicious or wanton. It may be done in the honest exercise of a right. Surely, if some one erects a fence which denies or obstructs my entrance to my house or grounds, I may remove it without subjecting myself to an indictment in the Quarter Sessions. Such an act lacks every element of malice or wantonness. Such appear to have been the facts in this case ; at least, it was so alleged by the defendants, and they were entitled to make such proof.\nWe think it was error to instruct the jury that \u201cthis act of assembly was passed to meet precisely such cases as this,\u201d etc. The case should have been submitted to the jury to find whether the act was malicious and wanton, or merely done in the exercise of a supposed legal right. In the one case, it is a crime; in the other, a trespass at most.\nAll of the specifications of error are sustained\nJudgment reversed, and a venire facias de novo awarded."}
