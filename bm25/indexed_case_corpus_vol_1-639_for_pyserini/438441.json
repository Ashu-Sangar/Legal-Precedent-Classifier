{"id": "438441", "contents": "Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court November 26th 1875,\nPer Curiam.\nThe able opinion of the learned president of the' court below upon the motion for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, renders any discussion by us unnecessary. We affirm this judgment on that opinion. It may be added that as to the point of the illegality of the loan on the ground that the-bank had violated its charter by loans to Garfield of more than ten per cent, of its entire capital, the recent case of O\u2019Hare v. The Second National Bank \u2014 not yet reported \u2014 but which will be in 27 P. F. Smith 96, fully sustains the judgment below.\nJudgment affirmed."}
