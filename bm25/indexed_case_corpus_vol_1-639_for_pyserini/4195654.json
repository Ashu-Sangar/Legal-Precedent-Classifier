{"id": "4195654", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 3rd day of June, 2009, it is hereby ordered that this appeal, filed on April 9, 2009, from the Commonwealth Court\u2019s March 9, 2009 Order denying Appellant\u2019s application for reconsideration of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s February 5, 2009 Order dismissing appellant\u2019s exceptions as untimely is quashed for lack of jurisdiction. The Commonwealth Court\u2019s March 9, 2009 Order denying reconsideration is not an appealable order. See, e.g., In re Merrick\u2019s Estate, 432 Pa. 450, 247 A.2d 786, 787 (1968) (quashing appeal from unappealable court order denying reconsideration); Murkey v. Corbin, 115 Pa.Cmwlth. 258, 533 A.2d 1091 (1987), appeal denied, 520 Pa. 621, 554 A.2d 512 (1988) (same); Boden v. Tompkins, 306 Pa.Super. 494, 452 A.2d 833, 834 (1982) (same). Further, the appeal was untimely, as it was not filed within 30 days after the entry of the Commonwealth Courts February 5, 2009 Order dismissing appellants exceptions. See Pa. R.A.P. 903(a); Day v. Civil Service Comm\u2019n of Carlisle, 593 Pa. 448, 931 A.2d 646, 651-52 (2007) (\u201cThe timeliness of an appeal involves jurisdiction.\u201d)."}
