{"id": "475023", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThe subject matter of the suit in equity out of which this appeal arises was heard and adjudicated by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County some six years ago; and, the final decree then entered was affirmed by this Court on appeal: see Wilson Estate, 346 Pa. 562, 31 A. 2d 106.\nThe import of the decisions both below and here was that, while Miriam B. Wilson, the widow of John C. Wilson, deceased,, could have claimed a status as creditor of her deceased husband\u2019s estate under their antenuptial agreement, she had, nevertheless,- by her conduct subsequent to her husband\u2019s death, elected to regard herself as an heir of heir husband' to the extent of her antenuptially agreed upon interest in his est\u00e1te and had. so acted toward the decedent\u2019s executors, creditors and other heirs. (The husband by- his will had done no more than appoint executors.)\nPayment of bank creditors of the husband in large amounts was made by his executors in reliane\u00e9 upon Mrs. Wilson\u2019s being an heir'and with her full knowledge and acquiescence -under advice of independent counsel. As a consequence one Of the creditors satisfied its lien against the decedent\u2019s realty and the other, having been paid in'full\" within-the'year following the decedent\u2019s death, took no action to perfect a lien, such- a course being unnecessary in the cited circumstances.- Ifi her\u2019 subsequent effort to change her status to that of creditor of the decedent, the widow was held to be estopped and her petition to require the children of the testator to pay into the estate a sum sufficient to award to her a distributive share as a creditor of her deceased husband\u2019s estate was disinissed: Mrs. Wilson having-died ifi February 1940, before the matter had come on for hearing in the Orphans\u2019 Court, her personal representatives were substituted for her of record, and, thereafter, they appealed to this Court from the adverse decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court with the result as already indicated. The same personal representatives and one of them in her individual capacity as an heir of Mrs. Wilson are the several present appellants from the decree of the Court of Common Pleas dismissing the bill which they filed in January 1946 to impress a trust upon the residual realty; of dbhfi' \u00d3:: Wilson, 'deceased, in favor of Ms widow as an heik' \\\nThe learnedcourt below, dismissed .the plaintiffs\u2019 bill, of complaint on. the.;ground;.that the matter in suit is res judicata, citing Wilson Estate, supra. While the result so arrived at seems manifestly correct, unfortunately for a definitive disposition of the controversy, we do not now reach the merits in the view we take of the present litigation. Whatever rights Mrs. Wilson had (and her 'estate succeeded to)' in her deceased husband\u2019s estate existed by yirtue of her status as an heir of her husband to the extent of her limited interest specified in the antehuptial' agreement: The place for the enforcement of any such rights is the Orphans\u2019 Court, /[he Jurisdiction whereof in the premises Mrs. Wiison invoked in her lifetime and her personal representatives thereafter pursued to final decree: see Gotwald v. Small, 242 Pa. 239, 240, 88 A. 1015; also Thomas v. Johnson, 356 Pa. 570, 572, 52 A. 2d. 663, and cases there cited.\nThe decree of the court below is vacated and the bill dismissed at the appellants' costs for want of jurisdiction.\nAs recognized in Wilson Estate, supra, at pp. 563-564, \". . . an antenuptial agreement ordinarily constitutes the wife a creditor rather than an,heir: [citing] Jones\u2019 Appeal, 62 Pa. 324; Coane\u2019s Estate, 310 Pa. 138, 165 A. 2; Goeckel's Estate, 131 Pa.
