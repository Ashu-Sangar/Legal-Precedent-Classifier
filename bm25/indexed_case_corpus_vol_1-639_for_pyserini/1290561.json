{"id": "1290561", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin B. Jones,\nEdward Pacewicz, the relator, on April 25, 1959 was arrested in Philadelphia County and placed in custody pending extradition proceedings for his return to the State of New York. On July 14, 1959 the Governor of this Commonwealth approved the requisition for Pacewicz\u2019s extradition. On November 5, 1959 the relator filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County for the purpose of securing his release from custody. On November 6, 1959, a hearing was held before Judge Hagan and, after hearing, writ of habeas corpus was denied. Prom that order the present appeal was taken.\nRelator raises two questions: (1) whether the court below acted fairly and impartially and (2) whether the failure of the Commonwealth to introduce into evidence the extradition warrant issued by the Governor of this Commonwealth entitled relator to a discharge from custody.\nUnder the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act of July 8, 1941, P. L. 288, 19 PS \u00a7191.1 et seq., the courts of an asylum state do not determine the guilt or innocence of the party sought to be extradited. Courts of the asylum state will order extradition if (1) the subject of the extradition is charged with a crime in the demanding state; (2) if the subject of the extradition was present in the demanding state at the time of commission of the crime charged; (3) if the subject of extradition is a fugitive from the demanding state; (4) if the requisition papers are in order: Commonwealth ex rel. Dronsfield v. Hohn, 390 Pa. 434, 135 A. 2d 757; Commonwealth ex rel. Hatton v. Dye, 373 Pa. 502, 96 A. 2d 127.\nOn this type of appeal our scope of review is limited to an inquiry as to whether the court of first instance had jurisdiction of the subject matter and whether the proceedings conducted therein were regular and in conformity with law: Commonwealth ex rel. Hunt v. Groman, 169 Pa. Superior Ct. 68, 82 A. 2d 278; Commonwealth ex rel. Mills v. Baldi, 166 Pa. Superior Ct. 321, 70 A. 2d 439; cert. den. 339 U. S. 986, 70 S. Ct. 1008; Commonwealth ex rel. Bucksbarg v. Good, 162 Pa. Superior Ct. 557, 58 A. 2d 842.\nAt the time of hearing in the court below certain exhibits were marked for identification: the warrant of the Governor of this Commonwealth, the warrant authorizing relator\u2019s arrest, the requisition papers signed by the Governor of the State of New York and the affidavit of the Governor of New York empowering two named New York City detectives to arrest relator. Although it appears from the record that the Commonwealth was content to rest its case upon the basis of these written documents, nevertheless the Commonwealth did call two witnesses. J. S. Desmond, a New York City detective, and Harold Yallely, the prosecutor.\nRelator had been indicted in the County of New York on three criminal charges: extortion, grand larceny in the first degree and personating a public officer. An examination of the three count indictment indicates that relator is charged with having on October 29, 1956 personated a police officer and, while so doing, obtained from Harold Vallely |3500, in cash, upon the false threat that Vallely, unless he paid this money, would be accused of a crime, arrested and detained.\nDesmond testified that he knew relator both as Edward Pacewicz and Edward Harvey and without qualification identified relator as the person named in the requisition papers of the Governor of the State of New York. Yallely, the alleged victim of the extortion, identified relator, stated that he had seen him on three occasions and that relator had come to his place of employment in New York on October 29, 1956 \u2014 the date of the commission of the alleged crimes \u2014 and had been at his hotel room on two prior occasions.\nRelator\u2019s first objection is to tbe conduct of the hearing judge, conduct which he terms unfair and partial. Specifically, relator claims that the hearing judge was unfair and partial in three respects: (1) when he stated: \u201cI am not going to tolerate these dilatory tactics any further. I have a long list. I am not going to make a big case out of this. There is no honest defense to this, and you know it\u201d; (2) when he stated: \u201cI am going to cut this [relator\u2019s counsel] cross-examination [of Yallely] short\u201d; (3) ivhen he refused to grant relator\u2019s motion for a continuance of the hearing for the purpose of presentation of alibi witnesses.\nAn understanding of the factual background is necessary to an evaluation of the hearing judge\u2019s conduct. On July 30, 1959, relator was originally brought before Judge McClanaghan and at that time relator\u2019s counsel told the court that he was going to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Upon that representation of counsel, relator was released from custody upon posting of bail in the amount of $500. Despite relator\u2019s counsel\u2019s representation to the court, no petition for a writ of habeas corpus was presented until November 5, 1959 \u2014 three months and five days after relator had been before Judge McClanaghan.\nOn November 6, 1959 \u2014 although the return day of the writ of habeas corpus was November 13, 1959\u2014 the parties appeared before Judge Hagan and at that time relator\u2019s counsel stated of record: \u201cWe have no objection to it being heard today\u201d. The Commonwealth then proceeded with its case and produced the four exhibits, supra, and the witness Desmond. At this point it must be observed that the record before Judge Hagan indicated that the Governor of New York, in accordance with the provisions of the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, supra, had officially represented to the Governor of this Commonwealth that (1) the relator was charged with the commission of three crimes in the State of New York; (2) that the relator had been present in the State of New York on the date of the alleged commission of the crime, i.e., October 29, 1956; (3) that relator was a fugitive from the State of New York. Desmond\u2019s testimony then unequivocally identified relator as the person and individual named in the requisition papers. At that point in the hearing relator\u2019s counsel requested that \u201cthe prosecutor [Yallely] do something or other\u201d and it was at that time the hearing judge made the first remark concerning which relator now complains. In view of the dilatory tactics pursued by relator\u2019s counsel and the clear and precise proof, through the medium of the written documents and Desmond\u2019s oral testimony that relator was in fact the person named in the requisition papers of the Governor of the State of New York, the hearing judge\u2019s remark is understandable. It is evident that relator\u2019s counsel, under the guise of a writ of habeas corpus, was attempting to secure a determination of relator\u2019s guilt or innocence of the offense with which he was charged in New York and for which he was being held for extradition.\nFollowing the hearing judge\u2019s remark, Yallely testified. Upon completion of his testimony in chief, and after he had answered twenty-nine questions on cross-examination, the hearing judge cut short the cross-examination. Up to that point Yallely had clearly and unequivocally identified relator as having been in the State of New York on October 29, 1956, the time of his alleged commission of the crime charged against him there. When the hearing judge put an end to the cross-examination, relator\u2019s counsel was attempting to discredit Vallely\u2019s original identification of relator by photographs in New York. The identification of relator as the person who had been in New York when the crime was committed was complete and what relator\u2019s counsel Avas then attempting to do was discredit Yallely\u2019s testimony, a matter for the courts of the demanding state rather than the courts of the asylum state. The issue before Judge Hagan was whether relator was in the State of New York when the alleged crimes were committed and not whether relator was guilty or innocent of the commission of such crimes. The hearing judge very properly cut short relator\u2019s counsel\u2019s cross-examination.\nRelator further complains that the hearing judge refused a motion for a continuance for the purpose of the production of Avitnesses to show that relator was not in the State of New York on October 29, 1956. Relator\u2019s counsel had already informed the court of his willingness to proceed. A hearing of the witnesses Avhose presence relator\u2019s counsel desired would have been of importance on the question of relator\u2019s guilt or innocence of the commission of these crimes and not his amenability to extradition. The question of the continuance of this hearing Avas a matter within the discretion of the hearing judge and we find on this record no circumstances indicating that he abused his discretion in this respect.\nRelator\u2019s final attack on the proceedings in the court below is that the Commonwealth did not offer nor did the court below receive in evidence the warrant of extradition, i.e., the warrant of the Governor of this Commonwealth, and, therefore, relator urges he is entitled to be discharged from custody. The Commonwealth had requested that four exhibits be marked for identification: (1) the \u201cGovernor\u2019s warrant\u201d; (2) the \u201cwarrant for the arrest of the relator\u201d; (3) the requisition papers of the Governor of New York; (4) \u201cthe affidavit of the Governor of New York\u201d authorizing two named New York City detectives to arrest relator. After these four exhibits had been marked for identification and after Commonwealth\u2019s counsel had referred to the contents of the requisition papers, Commonwealth\u2019s counsel then stated to the court: \u201cI move this exhibit into evidence\u201d. (Emphasis supplied). From this remark relator\u2019s counsel now argues that only exhibit 3 \u2014 the requisition papers \u2014 were offered and received into evidence. The record furnishes no foundation for this argument. Immediately after Commonwealth\u2019s counsel had made this statement he referred the hearing judge to Commonwealth ex rel. Mills v. Baldi, 166 Pa. Superior Ct. 321, 70 A. 2d 439, wherein the Superior Court stated: \u201cWhere, in such proceeding, the executive warrant and the requisition in the extradition proceeding are introduced in evidence, a prima facie case is made out\u201d. (Emphasis supplied). It. is clear and explicit that Commonwealth\u2019s counsel meant and that the hearing judge and relator\u2019s counsel so understood that all four exhibits of the Commonwealth had been received in evidence. The hearing judge in his opinion stated: \u201cAt the hearing the Commonwealth introduced in evidence the warrant of the Governor of the State of Pennsylvania (Exhibit No. 1), the warrant for the arrest of the defendant (Exhibit No. 2), and the warrant of the Governor of the State of New York (Exhibit No. 3)\u201d. All four exhibits were properly in evidence and part of the record before the hearing judge. Furthermore, at no time in the court below did relator\u2019s counsel allege or contend that the Commonwealth had failed to introduce these exhibits into evidence. We cannot entertain such a complaint at this time and, furthermore, if we could, the record shows that such complaint is without merit.\nAfter a careful examination of the record of the hearing in the court below, we are satisfied that the Commonwealth established that relator was subject to extradition to the State of New York, that relator received a fair and impartial hearing and that the action of the court below in refusing to discharge relator from custody was fully justified.\nOrder affirmed.\nAmong the requisition papers is an affidavit by Vallely. In tbis affidavit Vallely stated that in October 1956, lie and a casual male acquaintance were in his hotel room in the Hotel Plymouth, Manhattan, when the relator and another man came into the room and identified themselves as police officers; that relator in a conversation with Vallely, told Vallely that the police were looking for his companion and \u201cit was too bad that he got mixed up with him\u201d; on October 29, 1956 relator came to Vallely\u2019s place of employment with another man whom he introduced as \u201cChief\u201d; on that occasion relator told Vallely that his acquaintance had been brought into court on charges on that same date and that, Vallely would be brought before the court unless he gave relator $3500 in cash; that he, Vallely, gave the two men, including relator, $3500 in $100 biUs; that he had identified relator from a photograph shown him by the New York police.\nThe Uniform Criminal Extradition Act, supra, \u00a710, 19 PS 191.10 provides that such a petition must be filed within a \u201creasonable time\u201d."}
