{"id": "866854", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIt being conceded that the money attached in the hands of the Scranton Traction Co., garnishee, was due Oliver E. Lutz for wages earned by him as a street car conductor in the employ of said garnishee, the learned judge of the court below rightly held that it was not attachable, even on a judgment based on a claim for wages. There was therefore no error in reversing the proceedings against the garnishee. Neither of the assignments of error is sustained.\nJudgment affirmed."}
