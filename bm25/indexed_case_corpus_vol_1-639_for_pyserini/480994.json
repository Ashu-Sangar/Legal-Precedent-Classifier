{"id": "480994", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant Paul D. Ware was convicted by a jury of the 1963 murder of Miss Florence Grauley, age 83. After denial of appellant\u2019s post-trial motions, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. This appeal followed. Appellant raises a variety of claims, all of which we find to be without merit. We affirm.\nAppellant first contends that he has been denied a speedy trial in violation of the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. Resolution of this claim requires consideration of the long history of this case.\nWare was arrested on September 27, 1963. He confessed to the murder of Miss Grauley and other crimes on October 3 and was indicted by the grand jury on December 12. However he was declared incompetent to stand trial and was accordingly committed on January 8,1964, to Farview State Hospital.\nHe was discharged from Farview on July 19, 1967, having been found competent. On April 16, 1968, appellant filed a motion to suppress his confession as obtained in violation of his constitutional rights. After a hearing, the court suppressed the confession on May 23, 1968, on the ground that Ware had not received Miranda warnings.\nThe Commonwealth determined that, without his confession, it had insufficient evidence to proceed to trial. Consequently, it moved on December 12, 1968, for a nolle prosequi of the indictment, which was granted with the consent of appellant\u2019s counsel.\nThe decision of the United States Supreme Court in Jenkins v. Delaware, 395 U.S. 213, 89 S.Ct. 1677, 23 L. Ed.2d 253 (1969), caused the Commonwealth to believe that Ware\u2019s confession might be admissible despite the absence of Miranda warnings. Accordingly, on August 11, 1969, it petitioned for removal of the nol pros order and vacation of the suppression order. Removal of the nol pros was granted, over the objection of appellant, on December 11, 1969, and the suppression order was vacated on June 19,1970.\nOn June 25, 1970, a new suppression hearing was held, and appellant\u2019s motion to suppress was denied on November 13, 1970. Upon the joint petition of appellant and the Commonwealth, the court certified its order and we permitted an appeal. On December 20, 1971, we reversed the denial of the motion to suppress and held that appellant\u2019s confession was inadmissible. Commonwealth v. Ware, 446 Pa. 52, 284 A.2d 700 (1971). The Commonwealth petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of certiorari, which was granted on March 20, 1972. Pennsylvania v. Ware, 405 U.S. 987, 92 S.Ct. 1254, 31 L.Ed.2d 453 (1972). However, on April 24, 1972, the writ of certiorari was vacated and the petition denied, \u201cit appearing that the judgment below rests on an adequate state ground.\u201d Pennsylvania v. Ware, 406 U.S. 910, 92 S.Ct. 1606, 31 L.Ed.2d 821 (1972).\nThereafter, on July 3, 1972, appellant filed an application for dismissal under Pa.R.Crim.P. 316, contending that he had been deprived of his right to a speedy trial. The application was denied on September 26, 1972. Trial finally began on June 21, 1973, 117 months after his arrest.\nThough the right to a speedy trial is \u201cone of the most basic rights preserved by our Constitution,\u201d Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213, 226, 87 S.Ct. 988, 995, 18 L.Ed.2d 1 (1967), it is also \u201ca more vague concept than other procedural rights. It is . . . impossible to determine with precision when the right has been denied.\u201d Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 521, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 2187, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972). Vagueness results at least in part from the incompatibility of haste with the procedural safeguards designed to effectuate other rights of the accused and to insure that he receives due process.\n\u201c [1] n large measure because of the many procedural safeguards provided an accused, the ordinary procedures for criminal prosecution are designed to move at a deliberate pace. A requirement of unreasonable speed would have a deleterious effect both upon the rights of the accused and upon the ability of society to protect itself.\u201d\nUnited States v. Ewell, 383 U.S. 116, 120, 86 S.Ct. 773, 776, 15 L.Ed.2d 627 (1966). Thus, it has long been recognized that Beavers v. Haubert, 198 U.S. 77, 87, 25 S.Ct. 573, 576, 49 L.Ed. 950 (1905).\n\u201cThe right of a speedy trial is necessarily relative. It is consistent with delays and depends upon circumstances.\u201d\nTherefore, \u201cany inquiry into a speedy trial claim necessitates a functional analysis of the right in the particular context of the case . . . .\u201d Barker v. Wingo, supra, at 522, 92 S.Ct. at 2188. We are required to \u201cengage in a difficult and sensitive balancing process,\u201d id. at 533, 92 S.Ct. at 2193, \u201cin which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are weighed.\u201d Id. at 530, 92 S.Ct. at 2192 (footnote omitted). The factors we must consider in this balancing process are \u201c [1] ength of delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\u2019s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Id. (footnote omitted). A balancing of these factors leads us to conclude that appellant was not denied his right to a speedy trial.\nLength of delay serves as a triggering mechanism. \u201cWhen a delay is so extensive that a court considers it presumptively prejudicial, inquiry into the three other factors is necessary.\u201d Commonwealth v. Williams, 457 Pa. 502, 507, 327 A.2d 15, 17 (1974); see generally Barker v. Wingo, supra, at 530, 92 S.Ct. at 2192. It can hardly be doubted that a delay of 117 months is presumptively prejudicial. See Commonwealth v. Williams, supra; Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 449 Pa. 297, 299-300, 297 A.2d 127, 128 (1972).\nThe tangled nature of these proceedings renders assignment of reasons for the delay a complex task. The longest period, 43 months, represents the time during which appellant was incompetent to stand trial. The Commonwealth bears no responsibility for this delay, for the Constitution forbids the trial of a defendant who is mentally incompetent to participate in his defense. This period of delay, necessary for the protection of appellant\u2019s right to a fair trial, is obviously justifiable.\nThe second longest period is the time consumed by pretrial proceedings, including motions and an interlocutory appeal, a total of 33 months. It was intimated by the court below that assessment of the delay resulting from pretrial proceedings requires a determination of the moving party and, if the defendant was the moving party, whether his action was taken to vindicate his constitutional rights. Barker v. Wingo, supra, teaches that the balancing test is not a mechanical process of parsing the pleadings. We believe that a reasonable amount of time consumed by the disposition of motions and interlocutory appeals not made for purposes of delay, regardless of who is the moving party, is justifiable delay. See ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Speedy Trial \u00a7 2.3(a) (Approved Draft, 1968); see also Blunt v. United States, 131 U.S.App.D.C. 306, 404 F.2d 1283, 1286 (1968), cert. denied, 394 U.S. 909, 89 S.Ct. 1021, 22 L.Ed.2d 221 (1969).\nAnother period of delay, 12 months, was caused by the nol pros sought by the Commonwealth. In the particular circumstances of this ease, we do not think the delay unjustifiable. See ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Speedy Trial \u00a7 2.3(f) (Approved Draft, 1968). Because appellant\u2019s counsel consented to the nol pros, this is not a case of \u201cthe indefinite postponement of trial over the objection of the accused . . . Commonwealth v. Leaming, 442 Pa. 223, 227, 275 A.2d 43, 45 (1971); see Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213, 87 S.Ct. 988, 18 L.Ed.2d 1, (1967); Commonwealth v. Gant, 213 Pa.Super. 427, 249 A.2d 845 (1968). Two other short periods of delay are clearly excusable. Two months is a reasonable time for action by the grand jury. One month, certainly a reasonable period, was consumed in proceedings for appellant\u2019s commitment to Farview.\nThus, 91 months have been accounted for. The remaining 26 months remain unexplained and unexcused. However, consideration of the other factors of the Barker test leads us to conclude that appellant\u2019s right to a speedy trial has not been violated.\nFirst, there is nothing in the record indicating that appellant was prejudiced in his defense by the delay. He has suffered the inherent prejudice of long pretrial incarceration. But we are unable to conclude that he has suffered any impairment of his defense, which is the most serious type of prejudice\n\u201cbecause the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system. If witnesses die or disappear during a delay, the prejudice is obvious. There is also prejudice if defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately events of the distant past.\u201d\nBarker v. Wingo, supra, at 582, 92 S.Ct. at 2193.\nThere is here not the slightest hint that appellant\u2019s defense has been impaired by delay, no claims of dead, forgetful, or unavailable witnesses. Thus, this case differs markedly from those where specific impairment of the defense was a factor leading to a conclusion that the right to a speedy trial has been violated: Dickey v. Florida, 398 U.S. 30, 38, 90 S.Ct. 1564, 1569, 26 L.Ed.2d 26 (1970) (deaths of two witnesses, unavailability of a witness, loss of police records); Commonwealth v. Williams, 457 Pa. 502, 507, 327 A.2d 15, 18 (1974) (loss of memory by a witness, death of a witness, and unavailability of two witnesses); Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 449 Pa. 297, 301, 297 A.2d 127, 129 (1972) (death of a witness); Commonwealth v. Clark, 443 Pa. 318, 331-332, 279 A.2d 41, 48-49 (1971) (defendant\u2019s loss of memory, unavailability of five witnesses, loss of physical evidence).\nMore importantly, the record demonstrates that appellant did not want a speedy trial. It is true that he objected to the removal of the nol pros on the ground that trial at that time would violate his speedy trial right and twice moved to dismiss on the same ground, in July, 1972, and at trial. However, he never demanded an immediate trial; see Barker v. Wingo, supra, at 535, 92 S. Ct. at 2194. His counsel\u2019s consent to the Commonwealth\u2019s petition to nol pros contrasts sharply with the demands for a speedy trial made by the defendants in Klopfer v. North Carolina, supra; Commonwealth v. Leaming, supra; and Commonwealth v. Gant, supra. We conclude, as did the Supreme Court in Barker v. Wingo, supra, that\n\u201cwe would be reluctant indeed to rule that a defendant was denied this constitutional right on a record that strongly indicates, as does this one, that the defendant did not want a speedy trial.\u201d\n407 U.S. at 536,92 S.Ct. at 2195.\nIn light of the absence of specific prejudice and appellant\u2019s failure to demand a speedy trial, we conclude that the balance of the relevant factors indicates appellant has not been denied his right to a speedy trial.\nAppellant\u2019s next assignments of error relate to the issues of testimonial competency. At trial the Commonwealth relied primarily on admissions appellant made while he was an inmate at the Farview State Hospital. Three witnesses who had also been Farview inmates testified to hearing appellant\u2019s admissions. John Wesley Chase and Clarence Marshall testified that Ware admitted burglarizing the home of Miss Grauley and murdering her. Edward Whelan reported overhearing a conversation in which Ware stated that \u201che had a mission in life to eliminate or destroy elderly white persons.\u201d\nAppellant\u2019s argument is two-fold. First, he contends that Chase, Marshall, and Whelan were mentally incompetent, and thus should not have been permitted to testify. Second, he contends he was mentally incompetent at the time he made the incriminating statements, which accordingly should not have been admitted into evidence. We disagree on both counts.\nIn general, the testimony of any person, regardless of his mental condition, is competent evidence unless it contributes nothing whatever because he is wholly untrustworthy. Incompetency does not follow from the fact that the witness is insane or mentally ill. \u201cThe question being whether the person is trustworthy as a witness, the law now asks whether in each case the derangement or defect is such as to make the person highly untrustworthy as a witness; it no longer excludes absolutely.\u201d- 2 J. Wigmore, Law of Evidence \u00a7 492, at 584 (3d ed. 1940).\nThe mental competency of every witness is presumed; the burden of proof of incompetency rests on the party opposing the witness. However,\n\u201cthe fact that the witness is, at the time of testifying, or was shortly beforehand, a lawful inmate of an asylum for mental disease or defect, or an adjudged lunatic or defective, makes it necessary that his capacity should be examined into and an express finding appear.\u201d\n2 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 497, at 589 (3d ed. 1940); see District of Columbia\u2019s Appeal, 343 Pa. 65, 72, 21 A.2d 883, 887 (1941).\nThe standard of testimonial competency is carefully formulated to exclude factors extraneous to trustworthiness:\n\u201cThe general rule is that a lunatic or a. person affected with insanity is admissible as a witness if he has sufficient understanding to apprehend the obligation of an oath, and to be capable of giving a correct account of the matters which he has seen or heard in reference to the questions at issue . . . . \u201d\nCommonwealth v. Kosh, 305 Pa. 146, 156, 157 A. 479, 482 (1931).\nThe core of the competency test is ability to give \u201ca correct account of the matters which he has seen or heard.\u201d Capacity to give a correct account must be analyzed in terms of the constituent elements of testimonial trustworthiness, perception, memory, and communication; \u201c[i]f the inquiry is to deal with the relation of the derangement or defect of each person to his actual trustworthiness, it seems clear that each of the three elements must be considered.\u201d Wigmore, supra, \u00a7 492, at 586. In short, the question must be, \u201c[i]s his capacity to observe, remember, and recount, such that he can probably bring added knowledge of the facts?\u201d McCormick\u2019s Handbook of the Law of Evidence \u00a7 62, at 140 (2d ed. E. Cleary 1972) (emphasis supplied).\nThe elements of memory and communication ordinarily are simply stated: the witness must have the mental capacity to recollect the events testified to, understand the questions, and communicate intelligible answers. However, this Court has never directly faced the question whether testimonial competency requires minimum mental capacity at the time of the events testified to. We hold that it does.\nBecause ability to perceive is an element of testimonial trustworthiness and a competency inquiry is directed toward trustworthiness, it follows that capacity to perceive is an essential element of testimonial competency. There is no basis for crediting the testimony of a witness who was mentally incapable of correctly perceiving the event, for he is wholly untrustworthy. We are thus in agreement with the reasoning of the California Supreme Court in People v. McCaughan, 49 Cal.2d 409, 317 P.2d 974 (1957). Mr. Justice Traynor wrote for the court:\n\u201cIt is apparent from the requirement that the witness have the ability to give a substantially accurate account of the event witnessed . . . that he must have had the ability to perceive the event with a substantial degree of accuracy. ... It follows that if the proposed witness was suffering from some insane delusion or other mental defect that deprived him of the ability to perceive the event about which it is proposed that he testify, he is incompetent to testify about that event.\u201d\nId. at 420, 317 P.2d at 981.\nWe have previously reached the same conclusion with regard to the analogous situation of mental immaturity. In Rosche v. McCoy, 397 Pa. 615, 156 A.2d 307 (1959), we held that a witness who was 4 years old at the time of the event and 7 years old at the time of trial was incompetent.\n\u201c[T]he issue is not to be determined merely because of the capacity of the witness at the time he is called to communicate his thoughts in terms of language. There must be (1) such capacity to communicate, including as it does both an ability to understand questions and to frame and express intelligent answers, (2) mental capacity to observe the occurrence itself and the capacity of remembering what it is that she is called to testify about and (3) a consciousness of the duty to speak the truth ....\n\u201c.Carolyn\u2019s memory of the event and its details did not, indeed it could not, improve as time went on. The only thing that did improve was her capacity to communicate in terms of words. But that capacity is meaningless unless supported by the capacity to note the occurrence at the time it happened and the ability to remember it.\u201d\nId. at 620-621, 622, 156 A.2d at 310-311 (emphasis removed).\nWe therefore hold that testimonial competency requires mental capacity to perceive the event with a substantial degree of accuracy. \u201c[A]n incapacity to observe intelligently at the time of the events to be observed would suffice to exclude the person.\u201d Wigmore, supra, \u00a7 493, at 586 (emphasis removed).\nThe degree of mental capacity required is impossible to formulate precisely, and accordingly the determination of competency rests in the sound discretion of the trial court. One guideline for the exercise of discretion is that the degree of capacity required for testimonially competent perception, recollection, and narration is proportionate to the complexity of the event testified to.\n\u201cSimple tasks call for comparatively simple skills. A person called upon to make a simple identification and tell what he saw with a minimum of interpretation of the meaning of the events related requires little else than correct perception. If a person is asked to interpret a highly complex set of events whose understanding calls for acute facility in the difficult processes of logical reasoning, however, a higher degree of intelligence may be needed for both comprehending and communicating the information. More intelligence is required for a witness to testify to complex contract negotiations than to an automobile accident in which he was not a party or otherwise emotionally involved.\u201d\nWeihofen, Testimonial Competence and Credibility, 34 Geo.Wash.L.Rev. 53, 58 (1965) (footnote omitted); see Rosche v. McCoy, supra, at 621, 623, 156 A.2d at 310, 311.\nIn this case, Chase, Marshall, and Whelan simply repeated statements Ware made to them or in their presence. Trustworthy testimony required little more than audition, simple recollection, and recital; a \u201cminimum of interpretation\u201d and no \u201cexercise of contemporaneous judgment\u201d were involved. Accordingly, the mental capacity required of them to meet the test of competency is minimal indeed.\nThe Commonwealth produced Dr. Bernard Willis, a psychiatrist and the clinical director of Farview State Hospital, who testified out of the presence of the jury. He was professionally familiar with the mental condition of Ware and the three witnesses from both personal observation and staff reports. His testimony (which was the only extrinsic evidence admitted on the subject of competency) dealt with all four.\nJohn Chase was admitted to Farview on April 1, 1958, and remained there through the time of the trial. He suffered from chronic paranoid schizophrenia. Dr. Willis testified, however, that his mental illness was \u201ccompartmentalized,\u201d limited to delusions of a conspiracy against him by organized crime. Apart from these delusions, his mind operated normally. Because on any matter related to Paul Ware \u201cno aberration appears,\u201d Chase was \u201ccapable of giving a correct account of the matters which he has . . . heard in reference to the questions at issue,\u201d and thus a competent witness.\nEdward Whelan was a Farview inmate from March 20, 1969, to November 28, 1971, while he was incompetent to stand trial for crimes of which he was accused. Dr. Willis testified that Whelan suffered from delusions about the assassination of President Kennedy. He added, however, that Whelan\u2019s delusions were limited to that area; otherwise, his mind functioned normally. Because he, like Chase, entertained no delusions on any subject even remotely connected with Ware, there is no doubt that he was competent to testify to the admission made to him by Ware.\nThe evidence concerning Clarence Marshall does not indicate a compartmentalized illness. It is therefore necessary to determine his capacity to observe, remember, and narrate. Dr. Willis testified clearly and convincingly concerning Marshall\u2019s memory, communication, and sincerity; those parts of the test are abundantly satisfied. Therefore, only his perceptive capacity requires further inquiry.\nMarshall was a Farview inmate from November 14, 1960, to December 31, 1964. According to Dr. Willis, after Marshall had been sentenced at age 20 to a term of 30 to 80 years imprisonment,\n\u201cHe became very moody, he became very depressed, he was filled with bitterness, he was filled with anger. He was just so charged with negative emotions that he just couldn\u2019t think straight and even began to have mild kinds of hallucinations. .\n\u201cHe was overpowered, he was overwhelmed by his emotions.\u201d\nMarshall was subject to auditory hallucinations. However, the possibility that he hallucinated the Ware admission was convincingly excluded by Willis\u2019 testimony:\n\u201cThese were mild or primitive hallucinations, if you will, since they were simply sounds, they were not voices. They did not convey any message, they weren\u2019t well developed hallucinatory experiences. . . . But the important thing is not so much the quality of the sound, but it was not a voice, it didn\u2019t have information, it wasn\u2019t conveying a message, and it was not part of a delusional system . . . .\u201d\nWe conclude that, in light of the minimal perceptive capacity required, Dr. Willis\u2019 affirmation that Marshall \u201cis capable of giving correct accounts of matters which he has . . . heard\u201d was a sufficient basis for the trial court to find that Marshall possessed the requisite perceptive capacity.\nAccordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling appellant\u2019s objections to the competency of Chase, Whelan, and Marshall and permitting them to testify to appellant\u2019s admissions.\nHowever, appellant also contends that it was error to permit testimony of his admissions for the additional reason that he was incompetent at the time he allegedly made them. We disagree.\nAppellant relies on Commonwealth v. Mozzillo, 443 Pa. 171, 278 A.2d 874 (1971), in which the defendant was found incompetent to stand trial and was committed to an institution for mental defectives. When he was later tried, the prosecution produced a guard who testified to hearing Mozzillo make incriminating statements on numerous occasions. This Court reversed his conviction.\nThere we held, first, that the competency of hearsay declarants to make admissions \u201cis governed by rules of testimonial capacity,\u201d namely, the Kosh test. 443 Pa. at 176, 278 A.2d at 877. We further held that, if an accused is institutionalized for incompetence to stand trial when he makes incriminating admissions, the presumption of competency is reversed and the Commonwealth has the burden of establishing that he was testimonially competent at the time the admissions were made.\nFinally, we held that, in that case, the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden because the evidence presented was irrelevant to Mozzillo\u2019s competency at the time of his admissions.\n\u201cWe do not think that [the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness\u2019] testimony can be relied upon to prove appellant\u2019s competency at the time of his admissions. [The expert\u2019s] examination took place more than two months after appellant made the last of his statements, and [the expert] admitted that he could only speculate as to appellant\u2019s mental condition at earlier times.\u201d\n443 Pa. at 176-177, 278 A.2d at 877. Appellant contends that the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden here because its evidence did not establish his competency at the time of his admissions. We disagree.\nWare was institutionalized from January 8, 1964, to July 19, 1967, and from May 26, 1969, to August 3, 1969. The admissions were made to Chase on January 9, 1964; to Marshall sometime in the latter half of 1964; and to Whelan \u201cin May or June, possibly July of 1969.\u201d There were seven formal staff psychiatric evaluations of Ware ; Dr. Willis participated in five of those and reviewed all of them. In addition, he reviewed substantial information from staff members, including the head of the social services department, who was Ware\u2019s group therapist.\nIn contrast to Mozzillo, Willis\u2019 opinion was based on examinations of Ware either close in time to the admissions or both before and after the admissions. A full psychiatric evaluation was conducted 22 days after the statement to Chase. The statement to Marshall was both preceded and followed by psychiatric evaluations. The conversation overheard by Whelan occurred within less than one and a half months of an evaluation. We believe, in this case, the Mozzillo standard has been satisfied.\nMore importantly, in Mozzillo the expert \u201cadmitted that he could only speculate\u201d as to the defendant\u2019s condition at the time he made damaging admissions. Here, Dr. Willis\u2019 expert opinion establishing Ware\u2019s testimonial competency covered the entire period of Ware\u2019s commitment and obviously included the relevant times he made incriminating statements:\n\u201cQ. . . . [I)]uring the times, both periods, that Mr. Ware was at Farview, are you able to say whether or not if he were to make a statement to someone about something he did or heard or saw he would have sufficient memory and orientation and understanding to give an accurate account of what he was saying?\n\u201cA. I would expect that he would have adequate recall for his conversations generally.\n\u201cQ. And can you pinpoint that as to any time or at all times or whatever ?\n\u201cA. At all times that Mr. Ware was in Farview on his two admissions, in my opinion, he knew at all times what he was doing, the difference between right and wrong, truth or falsehood; that he. had control over his behavior to the point where whatever he did he did basically and deliberately and with full knowledge.\n\u201cQ. . . . [C]an you state that at all times during those two periods he had the competency to be able to be a witness . . . ?\n\u201cA. In my opinion, at all times this patient would be considered as a witness. . . . [T]here was a consistency of behavior that compels me' to believe and leaves me with a very strong opinion that at no time during his stay at Farview was this man incapacitated insofar as his competency to be a witness is concerned.\u201d\nDr. Willis\u2019 testimony establishes that Ware had sufficient capacity to accurately recall and communicate. The trial court therefore acted within its discretion in properly overruling appellant\u2019s objections and admitting the testimony of Chase, Marshall, and Whelan.\nAppellant next argues that the trial court erred in permitting the jury to consider the testimony of Chase, Marshall, and Whelan reporting his extra-judicial admissions because the Commonwealth failed to establish the corpus delicti. We disagree.\nWe have followed Professor Wigmore\u2019s analysis that a crime conceptually consists of three elements: \u201cfirst, the occurrence of the specific kind of injury or loss . . . ; secondly, somebody\u2019s criminality (in contrast, e. g., to accident) as the source of the loss, \u2014 these two together involving the commission of a crime by somebody; and, thirdly, the accused\u2019s identity as the doer of this crime.\u201d 7 J. Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2072, at 401 (3d ed. 1940) (emphasis removed); see Commonwealth v. May, 451 Pa. 31, 32, 301 A.2d 368, 369 (1973). Corpus delicti, meaning \u201cbody of the crime,\u201d consists of the first two elements. Commonwealth v. May, supra; Commonwealth v. Rhoads, 225 Pa.Super. 208, 213, 310 A.2d 406, 409 (1973). Specifically, \u201c \u2018[t]he corpus delicti [in a murder prosecution] consists of proof that a human being is dead and that such death took place under circumstances which indicate criminal means or the commission of a felonious act.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Milliken, 450 Pa. 310, 317, 300 A.2d 78, 82 (1973), quoting Commonwealth v. Frazier, 411 Pa. 195, 202, 191 A.2d 369, 373 (1963).\nAppellant invokes the rule that a criminal conviction may not be based on the extra-judicial confession or admission of the defendant unless it is corroborated by independent evidence establishing the corpus delicti. See Commonwealth v. May, supra; Commonwealth v. Leamer, 449 Pa. 76, 295 A.2d 272 (1972); Commonwealth v. Palmer, 448 Pa. 282, 285, 292 A.2d 921, 922 (1972); R. Perkins, Criminal Law 98 (2d ed. 1969). This rule is rooted in a hesitancy to convict one of crime on the basis of his own statements only.\n\u201cThe grounds on which the rule rests are the hasty and unguarded character which is often attached to confessions and admissions and the consequent danger of a conviction where no crime has in fact been committed . . . .\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Turza, 340 Pa. 128, 134, 16 A.2d 401, 404 (1940). Therefore, th\u00e9 rule requires that the prosecution introduce evidence independent of the defendant\u2019s statements which establishes that a crime has in fact occurred. See generally 3 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence \u00a7 691 (13th ed. C. Torc\u00eda 1973).\nThe first element, that a human being is in fact, dead, rarely presents difficulty. But proof of the second element \u2014 that death \u201coccurred through a criminal agency,\u201d Commonwealth v. May, supra, at 32, 301 A.2d at 369 \u2014 frequently is disputed. Often the circumstances of death are such that homicide cannot be established absent the statements of the accused as the cause of death to the exclusion of the accident or suicide. Accordingly, we have held that the corroboration policy is satisfied if the independent evidence \u201cpoints to an unlawful killing, although it may indicate as well accident or suicide,\u201d Commonwealth v. Coontz, 288 Pa. 74, 79, 135 A. 538, 539 (1927), or \u201c'where the circumstances attending the death are consistent with crime, though they may also be consistent with accident ... or suicide.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Turza, supra, at 135, 16 A.2d at 405. Although corroboration is insufficient if the independent evidence is equally consistent with accident or criminality, Commonwealth v. Leslie, 424 Pa. 331, 227 A.2d 900 (1967), \u201cthe prosecution has no duty to affirmatively exclude the possibility of accident or suicide in order to establish the corpus delicti.\u201d Commonwealth v. May, supra, at 33, 301 A.2d at 369-370.\nIn light of these principles, we conclude that appellant\u2019s contention that the Commonwealth failed to independently establish the second constituent of the corpus delicti so as to justify the consideration of his statements is without merit. The circumstances of the death of Miss Grauley clearly point to and are consistent with felonious homicide. The assistant county medical examiner testified that the injuries which caused death were \u201cconsistent with either a fall or a push or being thrown down a flight of 14 steps and coming to rest on a cement floor at the bottom.\u201d\nIn addition, the condition of the victim\u2019s home at the time of the discovery of her body indicated that a burglary had probably taken place. Witnesses testified that several rooms had been ransacked. Bureau drawers had been emptied onto the floor. Torn church offering envelopes were scattered on a table and the floor in the living room. Marks on the front door showed that it had probably been jimmied in a forced entry.\nThe nature of the fatal wounds and the state of the victim\u2019s home established that death probably resulted from homicide in the course of a burglary. Thus, the Commonwealth has \u201cestablished . . . that the death occurred under circumstances indicating that it was criminally caused by someone . . . Commonwealth v. Turza, supra, at 134, 16 A.2d at 404 (emphasis removed). Accordingly, it was proper to permit consideration of appellant\u2019s admissions.\nAppellant contends that he was denied a fair trial by the denial, without a hearing, of pretrial discovery of the identity of certain Commonwealth witnesses (Ch\u00e1se, Marshall, and Whelan). In earlier pretrial proceedings, appellant learned that the Commonwealth intended to present several witnesses to testify to incriminating admissions he had made. After informal requests for disclosure failed, appellant moved for the designation of names of the witnesses, which was denied by the calendar judge without a hearing. He now claims that he had a right to a hearing for the purpose of establishing his right to disclosure.\nPretrial discovery in criminal cases is governed by Pa.R.Crim.P. 310, which in pertinent part provides:\n\u201cAll applications of a defendant for pretrial discovery and inspection shall be made not less than five days prior to the scheduled date of trial. The court may order the attorney for the Commonwealth to permit the defendant or his attorney, and such persons as are necessary to assist him, to inspect and copy or photograph any written confessions and written statements made by the defendant. No other discovery or inspection shall be ordered except upon proof by the defendant, after hearing, of exceptional circumstances and compelling reasons.\u201d\nThe rule does not purport to grant defendant a hearing as of right in which to prove \u201cexceptional circumstances and compelling reasons.\u201d In order to be entitled to a hearing, he must at least allege circumstances and reasons which, if established, would be exceptional and compelling.\nAppellant\u2019s motion contained nothing of the sort. In his motion, counsel stated that disclosure was necessary for proper trial preparation and that failure to disclose might require a request for a continuance. The benefit of discovery of opposing witnesses in preparation for trial is potentially present in every case and is not exceptional in this case. An averment that a continuance may later be requested hardly rises to the level of \u201ccompelling.\u201d Defense counsel in fact did not request a continuance when the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Chase, Marshall, and Whelan. Because the circumstances and reasons presented by appellant\u2019s motion were not exceptional or compelling, he was not entitled to a hearing or disclosure of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses.\nAppellant finally contends that he was unfairly surprised, and thus deprived of a fair trial, by the presentation of fingerprint evidence that the Commonwealth had concealed by means of misrepresentation. We conclude that the contention is without merit.\nIn 1968 at a hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s request for a nolle prosequi, an assistant district attorney stated:\n\u201c[T]here is a partial [finger] print, which print in five points of the print are [sic] exactly the same as Ware but is woefully insignificant in terms of expert testimony. Five points is [sic] not enough . ; \u2019 . . \u201d\nAt trial in 1973, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Jacques Whaumbush, an experienced fingerprint expert. He testified that he examined the home of Miss Grauley several hours after the discovery of her body and recovered a latent fingerprint from a torn church envelope. On the basis of a comparison of at least nine significant points, he testified that there was \u201c[positively no doubt\u201d that \u201cthe ink rolled impression and the latent impression [found in the victim\u2019s home] was [sic] made by one and the same finger, that is, the left middle finger of Mr. Paul Ware.\u201d\nAppellant argues that he relied on the 1968 representation in concluding that the prosecution would not present fingerprint evidence and was therefore unfairly surprised by the Whaumbush testimony, entitling him to a new trial. We disagree.\nAppellant does not contend that the 1968 statement was an intentional attempt to deceive him. The Commonwealth never asserted that it would not use the fingerprint as evidence against Ware, nor did it conceal or deny the existence of any relevant evidence. The representation was merely an individual prosecutor\u2019s estimate of the probative significance of the recovered print. It was not unfair for the Commonwealth to re-evaluate its evidence; any argument to the contrary is meritless. Judgment of sentence affirmed.\nNIX, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art.

He was in for house burglary, and I asked him how you go about that, and he said, \u2018Well, I dress real clean and I goes up like I\u2019m the paper boy, the mailman,\u2019 and I particularly asked him about this one case that we all know about, the. lady in the flowered dress, because we had the paper .

Well, I asked Paul Ware was he the same Paul Ware that pushed the lady down the steps and beat her with a chair. He said yes.\n\u201cQ. What else, if anything, did he say?\n\u201cA. So I asked him why did he do it. He said, \u2018Well, I was robbing, I was taking some money out of her pocketbook,\u2019 and I asked him, an old lady like that, why did he do that, and he said he don\u2019t like no people, he don\u2019t like old people, and he don\u2019t like no white folks at all.\u201d\n.

The oath element\n\u201cis sometimes phrased in language as a requirement that the witness must have intelligence enough \u2018to understand the nature and obligation of an oath.\u2019 This requirement is manifestly inappropriate. It confounds a religious standard with a mental standard, and if literally applied the most intelligent witness could hardly meet the standard, much less ... an insane person.\u201d\nMcCormick, supra n. 19, at 140 (footnote omitted). The test is better formulated \u201cwhether he feels a duty to tell the truth.\u201d Id.\nSecond, it is evident from Kosh that capacity must be measured \u201cin reference to the questions at issue.\u201d For \u201cthe inquiry is always as to the relation of the derangement or defect to the subject to be testified about.

The force of all human testimony depends as much upon the ability of the witness to observe the facts as upon his disposition to describe them honestly, and if the mind of the witness is in such a condition that it can not accurately observe passing events, and if erroneous impressions are thereby made upon the tablet of the memory, his story will make but a feeble impression upon the hearer, though it be told with the greatest apparent sincerity.\u201d\n.

Dr. Willis testified as follows:\n\u201cQ. . . . [Wjould John Wesley Chase, would he be able to or is his memory and orientation sufficient, does he have sufficient understanding to be capable of giving correct accounts of matters which he has seen or heard, in your opinion?\n\u201cA. In my opinion,- if the matters that he is recounting don\u2019t have anything particularly to do with his delusional system, that his accuracy of recall would be the same as anyone else\u2019s.\n\u201cQ. . . . . [Yjou say as to events that occur outside [his] basic delusional system, that his recall, I think you stated, is as good as anybody else\u2019s, his memory?\n\u201cA. In other aspects he gives every indication of being quite normal. His relationships with the other patients, his relationships with the guards, his memory, his understanding of what is going on, his ability to promote himself and get things that he wants indicate generally a fairly good, quite good basic operation.\n\u201cQ. Specifically if he had a conversation with this defendant, Paul Ware, or for that matter any of the inmates at Farview about crimes they may have committed or they said they may have committed, would he be able to recount that accurately outside of his delusional system?\n\u201cA. In my opinion, he would be, yes.\u201d\n. Wigmore, supra n. 19, at 586; see n. 23 supra.\n. Commonwealth v. Kosh, supra n. 20, at 156, 157 A. at 482.\n. On the \u201coath\u201d branch of the Kosh test, Dr. Willis testified as follows:\n\u201cQ. . . . [A]re you able to form an opinion as to whether this individual, John Chase, if he were to be called at this trial at this time as a witness, whether he would be able to distinguish between the truth and falsehood and understand his obligation under bath to tell the truth?\n\u201cA. Yes, he would have such an understanding.\u201d\n. Dr. Willis testified:\n\u201cIn the case of Mr. Whelan, he had preoccupation with and delusions about the assassination of President Kennedy. He focused on these matters. He attributed influences in the area of the assassination to their having an effect on his life and explanation and reason for his being sent to Farview.\n\u201cWhile his thinking was clearly delusional it was to a degree compartmentalized. In areas quite away from or apart from his delusional system he would function generally as well as anyone else. It would only be in the area of his particular expression of illness where his thinking would be disordered so that you would bring into question the possibility of his accuracy of recall.\u201d\n. Dr. Willis also testified as follows:\n\u201cQ. . . . [F]rom your knowledge of Edward Whelan are you able to say whether in fact, he could differentiate between the truth and a lie, he would understand the nature and quality of an oath to tell the truth? Can you give us that opinion?\n\u201cA. From my knowledge of the patient over the several years that he was in the hospital I would believe now that he would be competent to tell the difference between a falsehood and the truth.\n\u201cQ. Now, secondly, Edward Whelan ... is going to recount a conversation he had somewhere in a period of four months in the middle of 1969, that he had with or overheard this defendant Paul Ware say .... Do you have an opinion on whether Edward Whelan could give us his memory and thinking processes intact sufficiently to give us an accurate account of what he heard Paul Ware say in that time period?\n\u201cA. In my opinion, he would be able to give you an accurate recounting of conversations between him and others at that time.\u201d\n. Dr. Willis testified:\n\u201cQ. From your examination of Clarence Marshall at Farview and your examination of him [the day before Willis testified] are you able to \u2014 and your overall supervision of his case while he was at Farview \u2014 are you able to give us an opinion on whether Clarence Marshall if he took the witness stand in this trial would be able to differentiate between the truth and falsehood, and understand the meaning and the obligation of his oath to tell the truth?\n\u201cA. I think he would clearly understand both those things, the difference between truth and falsehood and the meaning of his oath.\n\u201cQ. And, Doctor, again from all your observations at Farview, your personal psychiatric examinations, your examination with him yesterday, your supervision of his case, are you able to form an opinion as to whether if he took the stand at this trial, whether he would be capable, whether he has the sufficient orientation and memory, those facilities are intact enough that he is capable of giving correct accounts of matters which he has seen or heard?\n\u201cA. In my opinion, he would ably give a very clear, lucid and accurate recall.\u201d\n. \u201cThe only witnesses to the behavior of one detained for being incompetent to stand trial during the period of his detention are either employees of the Commonwealth or other inmates, most of whom are also incompetent. Under such circumstances, it would be cruel to place the burden on the inmate to prove his incompetence, especially when neither he nor his attorney knows it will be an issue until later, when the Commonwealth brings him to trial. Instead, since the Commonwealth is in control of his detention and the use it wishes to make of any admissions he makes, the burden should be placed on it to show that he was competent at the time his admissions were made.\u201d\nCommonwealth v.

The reason for placing the burden on the Commonwealth offered by Mozzillo, supra n. 37, does not apply to Ware\u2019s capacity to perceive at the relevant time, which was of course before his commitment to Farview. Accordingly, the presumption of capacity is applicable; appellant did not rebut it in this case. See text accompanying n. 21 supra; cf. Robinson v. United States, 113 U.S.App.D.C. 372, 308 F.2d 327, 332 (1962), cert. denied, 374 U.S. 836, 83 S.Ct. 1887, 10 L.Ed.2d 1058 (1963); 6 J.Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1751, at 156 (3d ed. 1940).\nIn addition, \u201c[t]he oath-capacity is a purely artificial one ., and has no inherent relation to testimonial capacity. It has no place in excluding extrajudicial declarations forming exceptions to the Hearsay rule . . . . \u201d Id. (emphasis removed).\n. The rule is frequently articulated in terms of a condition on the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s statements; see e. g., Commonwealth v. Palmer, 448 Pa. 282, 285, 292 A.2d 921, 922 (1972). \u201cBecause of the trial court\u2019s discretion over the order of proof, however, it is for practical purposes not a condition of admissibility but rather ... a formulation of the required proof to take the case to the trier of fact or to sustain a finding of guilt.\u201d McCormick\u2019s Handbook of the Law of Evidence \u00a7 158, at 347 (2d ed. E. Cleary 1972) (footnote omitted); see Commonwealth v. Burns, 409 Pa. 619, 637, 187 A.2d 552, 561-562 (1963); Commonwealth v. Lettrich, 346 Pa. 497, 498, 31 A.2d 155, 156 (1943); Commonwealth v. Ferguson, 162 Pa.Super. 199, 202, 56 A.2d 360, 361 (1948).\n. See Perkins, The Corpus Delicti of Murder, 48 Va.L.Rev. 173, 182-86 (1962).\n. We do not lose sight of the distinction between the requirement of corroboration of the statements of the accused and the Commonwealth\u2019s ultimate burden of proof. The former merely requires that the trial court be satisfied that a conviction will not result from a confession or admission when no crime has in fact been committed by anyone. Ultimately the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has in fact been committed. Commonwealth v. May, 451 Pa. 31, 33 n. 2, 301 A.2d 368, 370 n. 2 (1973); Commonwealth v. Maybee, 429 Pa. 222, 223, 239 A.2d 332, 333 (1968); see generally Commonwealth v. Rose, 457 Pa. 380, 321 A.2d 880 (1974). Commonwealth v. Maybee, supra, and Commonwealth v. Deyell, 399 Pa. 563, 160 A.2d 448 (1960), are examples of the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to finally prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime had in fact been committed.\n. The motion stated:\n\u201c15. Defense Counsel was unaware of the alleged witnesses for years and at this late date cannot properly prepare for trial in these cases without a proper indication of the alleged witnesses and the surrounding circumstances, particularly in view of the Commonwealth\u2019s previous position that without defendant\u2019s statements the Commonwealth could not prove its case.\n\u201c16. If Defense Counsel must wait until the Commonwealth attempts to call the undisclosed witnesses the defense in all probability will have to move for a continuance at that time until it can investigate the character and reputation of such alleged witnesses, as well as the circumstances under which they may have obtained any statement from the defendant in the course of his confinement and investigate the possibility of duress or lack of voluntariness therein.\u201d\n. Appellant cites Commonwealth v. Turra, 442 Pa. 192, 275 A.2d 96 (1971), as authority for his entitlement to a hearing. In this he is mistaken. In Turra we remanded for a hearing \u201cbecause of the evident confusion during the proceedings below, plus the fact that if Turra is convicted of the murder involved his life may be forfeited . . ..\u201d Id. at 197, 275 A.2d at 98. No such circumstances are present here.\nAppellant\u2019s reliance on Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 93 S. Ct. 2208, 37 L.Ed.2d 82 (1973), is also misplaced. Wardius held that a defendant may not constitutionally be compelled to disclose the names of witnesses he intends to call to establish an abili in the absence of reciprocal discovery against the prosecution. \u201cReciprocity ... is the key to Wardius.\u201d Com monwealth v. Jackson, 457 Pa. 79, 82, 319 A.2d 161, 163 (1974). Because the Commonwealth did not seek disclosure of the names of appellant\u2019s witnesses (and had no right to disclosure, cf. Pa.R. Crim.P. 312; Commonwealth v. Contakos, 455 Pa. 136, 314 A.2d 259 (1974)), Wardius is inapposite.\n. Compare Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function \u00a7 3.11(a) (Approved Draft, 1971)."}
