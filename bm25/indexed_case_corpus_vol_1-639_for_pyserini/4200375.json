The issue, reworded for clarity, is:\nWhether the decision of many plaintiffs in complex litigation to join in a single complaint, as permitted by Pa.R.C.P. 2229(a), prevents a trial' court from exercising its discretion under Pa.R.A.P. 213(b) to sever claims or order separate trials of a small number of bellwether plaintiffs?\nOral argument on the above issue is to be consolidated with 75 MAL 2010."}
