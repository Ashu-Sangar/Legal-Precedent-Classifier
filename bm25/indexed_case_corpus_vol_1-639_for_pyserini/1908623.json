{"id": "1908623", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThe jury returned a verdict for the defendant after a seven-day trial in a malpractice case. The lower Court denied a motion for a new trial. Prom the judgment entered on the verdict, plaintiff took this appeal.\nFor three days plaintiff had an uncontrolled frightful bleeding of the nose aud was in a very, very critical condition. His two able doctors, unable to stop or control this terrible bleeding, called in the defendant for an emergency operation, which was imperative in order to save plaintiff\u2019s life. The operation had to be performed within ten hours or plaintiff would have died. During this emergency operation plaintiff had to be given fifteen pints of blood.\nSeventeen errors are alleged by plaintiff. It would take more than half a dozen pages to merely state the medical testimony pro and con. We shall therefore briefly summarize it and the pertinent facts. Plaintiff during the operation became partially paralyzed. The real and basic issue in the case is this: Did defendant ligate, as he and his witnesses testified, the external carotid artery, or did he ligate (as plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified) the internal carotid artery? All the witnesses agreed that it would have constituted malpractice to have ligated the internal carotid artery.\nThe testimony of the defendant, an American board certified surgeon, was supported by another eminent American board certified surgeon, Dr. Brooke Roberts, and by plaintiff\u2019s family doctor, Dr. Rendall R. Straw-bridge, as well as by defendant\u2019s additional doctor, Dr. Louis E. Silcox, a board certified nose, ear and throat specialist, who was the otolaryngologist and chief of staff of that s\u00e9rvice at the Lankenau Hospital and who had treated plaintiff during the three days prior to the operation.\nPlaintiff had three medical witnesses. The trial Judge properly held that one of these witnesses \u2014 Dr. Cyril Wecht \u2014 was not an expert in this field and his opinion was inadmissible.\nPlaintiff\u2019s next witness, Dr. Michaels, testified that defendant had ligated plaintiff\u2019s internal carotid artery, and that this was the cause of plaintiff\u2019s semi-paralyzed condition. However, Dr. Michaels admitted that there were various medical conditions which could account for plaintiff\u2019s partially paralyzed condition, other than the ligature of the internal carotid artery. For example, Dr. Michaels admitted that an aneurysm, or a shock, or muscle spasm, or arteriosclerosis, or malformations of the arteriovenous system, or any or all of them, could have caused and were possible explanations for plaintiff\u2019s condition.\nA New York physician, Dr. Leon Friedman, testified that defendant ligated the internal carotid artery and this caused plaintiff\u2019s semi-paralyzed condition. Moreover, he disagreed with virtually everything that defendant\u2019s experts testified to.\nIf there ever was a case for the jury, this case \u2014 because of the conflicting evidence and the question of the credibility of the witnesses \u2014 was it! To recite at tremendous length the detailed medical testimony which no lawyer except the attorneys for the parties herein would be interested in, seems (we repeat) unnecessary and unwise. We have studied the entire record and have carefully considered all of plaintiff\u2019s contentions, including the charge of the Court, which under all the testimony was necessarily difficult, and we are convinced that there was no abuse of discretion or reversible error of law.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno and Mr. Justice Cohen took no part in the consideration or decision of this case."}
