{"id": "3992433", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nElmer Kennedy worked for Corban Corporation as a forklift operator. In December, 2000, he sustained work-related burns to his back. He sought workers\u2019 compensation benefits for the injuries; however, Corban Corporation\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier denied the claim due to a lack of insurance coverage.\nAs a result, on September 21, 2004, the Commonwealth filed a criminal complaint asserting six counts of third degree felony charges against Corban Corporation and William Condosta, a corporate officer of the company (collectively appellants), for failure to maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance pursuant to \u00a7 305 of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (Act). The Commonwealth alleged appellants failed to maintain insurance coverage during the following periods: November 1 through November 30, 2000; December 1 through December 22, 2000; June 18 through June 30, 2002; July 1 through July 31, 2002; August 1 through August 31, 2002; and September 1 through September 9, 2002.\nAppellants filed separate omnibus pretrial motions, objecting to the criminal complaint\u2019s timeliness. They argued the violations occurred more than two years before the Commonwealth filed charges, and that the applicable statute of limitations was the default provisions of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5552. If true, the entire complaint failed as untimely. Holding \u00a7 5552 applied, the trial court granted appellants\u2019 motions and dismissed the complaint. The Commonwealth appealed.\nThe Superior Court reversed, holding the five-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 1112 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 1039.12, controls. Commonwealth v. Corban Corporation, 909 A.2d 406, 413 (Pa.Super.2006). The Court relied on \u00a7 1039.12\u2019s plain language, which states, \u201c[a] prosecution for an offense under this act must be commenced within five years after commission of the offense.\u201d Id., at 412; 77 P.S. \u00a7 1039.12. The court held the General Assembly expressly intended \u00a7 1039.12 to apply to all offenses prosecuted under the Act. Id. Moreover, the court noted application of the default two-year period would be at odds with a provision of the Act permitting claim petitions to be filed within three years. Id., at 412-13.\nWe granted allowance of appeal to determine whether the statute of limitations provided in 77 P.S.- \u00a7 1039.12 or the default statute of limitations provided in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5552 applies to prosecutions for an employer\u2019s failure to maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance pursuant to 77 P.S. \u00a7 501. Since statutoiy interpretation is a question of law, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. In re Milton Hershey School, 590 Pa. 35, 911 A.2d 1258, 1261 (2006).\nAppellants assert there is no provision in the Act setting forth a specific statute of limitations for failing to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance; in the absence of a specific provision, the default limitations period of \u00a7 5552 applies. Appellants maintain the five-year limitations in \u00a7 1039.12 applies only to prosecutions for workers\u2019 compensation insurance fraud offenses under Article XI of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1039.1-1039.12. The Commonwealth contends the five-year limitations period applies to all prosecutions under the Act. The Commonwealth recognizes \u00a7 1039.12 is contained within a portion of the Act regarding insurance fraud, but notes this is the only provision of the Act which sets forth a statute of limitations for a criminal action. The Commonwealth, as did the Superior Court, relies on \u00a7 1039.12\u2019s plain language to conclude it applies to all offenses under the Act.\n\u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). \u201cWords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage....\u201d Id., \u00a7 1903(a). \u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d Id., \u00a7 1921(a). \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, they are presumed to be the best indication of legislative intent.\u201d Chanceford Aviation Properties, L.L.P. v. Chanceford Township Board of Supervisors, 592 Pa. 100, 923 A.2d 1099, 1104 (2007) (quoting Hannaberry HVAC v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Snyder Jr.), 575 Pa.66, 834 A.2d 524, 531 (2003)) (internal citation omitted).\nThe Statutory Construction Act provides that headings prefixed to titles, parts, articles, chapters, sections, and other divisions of a statute shall not be considered to control the manner in which the statute is to be interpreted. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1924. It is the statutory language itself that must be considered; not simply the location of the statute within the Act as a whole. See id.; see also O\u2019Rourke v. Commonwealth, Department of Corrections, 566 Pa. 161, 778 A.2d 1194, 1201 (2001) (legislative intent can only be derived by reading all sections of statute together and in conjunction with each other and construed with reference to entire statute); Housing Authority of the County of Chester v. Pennsylvania State Civil Service Commission, 556 Pa. 621, 730 A.2d 935, 945 (1999) (same).\nHere, the Act\u2019s language is free from ambiguity. Section 1039.12 specifies \u201c[a] prosecution for an offense under this act must be commenced within five years after commission of the offense.\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 1039.12 (emphasis added). A plain reading of this section reveals the General Assembly intended its limitations period to apply to prosecutions under \u201cthis act,\u201d which thus includes \u00a7 501 offenses.\nA review of the language within Article XI of the Act reveals the General Assembly took great care in choosing among the words \u201cclause,\u201d \u201csection,\u201d \u201carticle,\u201d and \u201cact.\u201d Cf. 77 P.S. \u00a7 1039.3(a) (\u201cUpon a conviction for an offense under this clause, the prosecutor shall certify the conviction to the disciplinary board of the Supreme Court for appropriate action\u201d) (emphasis added); id., \u00a7 1039.9(a) (\u201cThe district attorneys of the several counties shall have authority to investigate and to institute criminal proceedings for any violation of this article.\u201d) (emphasis added); id., \u00a7 1039.11(b) (\u201cIf a prosecuting authority has probable cause to believe that a person has violated this section, nothing in this clause shall be construed to prohibit the prosecuting authority and the person from entering into a written agreement in which that person does not admit or deny the charges but consents to payment of the civil penalty.\u201d) (emphasis added). In contrast, \u00a7 1039.12 does not use the term \u201carticle,\u201d \u201csection,\u201d or \u201cclause,\u201d but provides, \u201cA prosecution for an offense under this act must be commenced within five years after commission of the offense.\u201d Id., \u00a7 1039.12 (emphasis added). By choosing the word \u201cact,\u201d the General Assembly expressed its intent for the five-year limitations period to apply to \u00a7 501 prosecutions.\nWe agree with the Superior Court\u2019s apt observation that application of the two-year limitations period would be at odds with the Act\u2019s three-year limitations period regarding the filing of claim petitions. Section 315 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 602, covers the filing requirements for benefits, and permits an injured employee three years to file a claim petition, and typically it is upon filing of a claim petition that the agency which administers the claims process becomes aware of an employer\u2019s failure to carry insurance. If the offense is not normally discoverable for up to three years, it makes little sense to apply a statute that has already run by the time the crime is uncovered. Application of the five-year limitations period furthers the Act\u2019s intended purpose, which is to provide payment to the injured worker commensurate with the damage from accidental work-related injury, as a fair exchange for the surrender of every other right of action against the employer. See City of Erie v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Annunziata), 575 Pa. 594, 838 A.2d 598, 602 (2003). Application of the two-year limitations period, however, would unjustly impair the Commonwealth\u2019s ability to prosecute offenses, effectively enabling employers to evade the Act\u2019s requirements without consequence.\nWe find the five-year statute of limitations applies to prosecutions for an employer\u2019s failure to maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance pursuant to 77 P.S. \u00a7 501. Accordingly, we affirm the Superior Court\u2019s order. This matter is hereby remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justice SAYLOR and Justice GREENSPAN join the opinion.\nJustice BAER files a concurring opinion in which Justice TODD and Justice McCAFFERY join.\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, added by, the Act of June 24, 1996, P.L. 350, as amended 77 P.S. \u00a7 501. Section 501 provides, in relevant part:\n(a) (1) Every employer liable under this act to pay compensation shall insure the payment of compensation in the State Workmen's Insurance Fund, or in any insurance company, or mutual association or company, authorized to insure such liability in this Commonwealth. ...\n(b) Any employer who fails to comply with the provisions of this section for every such failure, shall, upon conviction in the court of common pleas, be guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree. If the failure to comply with this section is found by the court to be intentional, the employer shall be guilty of a felony of the third degree.\nId.\n. The criminal complaint also averred Encor Coatings, Inc., did not maintain workers' compensation insurance coverage from June 1 through July 17, 2003. The Commonwealth ultimately withdrew this count.\n. The Pennsylvania Attorney General\u2019s Office filed an amicus curiae brief, wherein it argues \u00a7 1039.12's plain language reveals a legislative intent that it apply to all prosecutions under the Act. Alternatively, it asserts the statute of limitations under \u00a7 1039.12 is specific, which always prevails over a general limitations provision such as \u00a7 5552. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1933."}
