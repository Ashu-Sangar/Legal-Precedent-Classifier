Whether tying a dog on one\u2019s property with food and water is sufficient for a finding of cruelty to animals simply because it is possible for the dog to entangle itself.\nb. Whether the evidence was sufficient to convict petitioner where she testified that she left her dog in a shed rather than on the porch."}
