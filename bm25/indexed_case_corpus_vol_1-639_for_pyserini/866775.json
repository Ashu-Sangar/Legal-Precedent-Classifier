{"id": "866775", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe only specification of error is an extract from the learned trial judge\u2019s charge, directing a verdict in favor of defendant. By agreement of counsel for the parties, the statement signed by them, embracing an extract from defendant\u2019s testimony, etc., has been printed in appellant\u2019s paper-book \u201cin lien of the evidence taken at the trial.\u201d That necessarily excludes from consideration any evidence or allegations of fact not contained in the agreement. In view of the facts thus agreed upon, there appears to be no error in directing a verdict for defendant.\nJudgment affirmed."}
