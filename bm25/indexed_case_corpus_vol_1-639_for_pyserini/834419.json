{"id": "834419", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe think the learned auditor and court below were right in rejecting the appellant\u2019s claim. It was exceedingly stale, if not suspicious. It was long since barred by the statute of limitations. The letter from John Toomey to the appellant, dated April 18, 1886, and which he relies upon to toll the statute, is found by the auditor to be a forgery. We cannot sustain any of the specifications of error.\nThe decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
