{"id": "1922571", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nSince the passage of the Act of April 11, 1848, P. L. 536, 48 P.S. \u00a7\u00a764 and 116, we have held on innumerable occasions that in order to bind a married woman\u2019s separate estate for medical services rendered herself and family it must be shown that those medical services were rendered at her request and on her credit.\nAppellant would have us ignore the long line of cases that would permit a creditor to recover against the wife\u2019s individual estate only in the event that the debt was contracted by the wife. Moore v. Copley, 165 Pa. 294, 30 Atl. 829 (1895); Sawtelle\u2019s Appeal, 84 Pa. 306 (1877); Berger v. Clark, 79 Pa. 340 (1876); Parke v. Kleeber & Bros., 37 Pa. 251 (1860), and Mur ray v. Keyes, 35 Pa. 384 (1860). The legislature has had ample opportunity to amend the Act of 1848 and disaffirm the interpretation placed upon it since Murray v. Keyes, supra. Since the legislature has refused to do this, we will reaffirm our interpretation of the Act.\nIn this litigation we do not find it necessary to determine whether a liquor license in decedent\u2019s n\u00e1me and subject to inheritance tax as part of decedent\u2019s estate is to be considered an asset of decedent\u2019s estate for distributive purposes. Jurisdiction to determine whether a liquor license in decedent\u2019s name at his death was an asset of decedent\u2019s estate is in the orphans\u2019 court; thus any determination made in the court of common pleas was without judicial competence.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Jones took no part in the consideration or decision of this case."}
