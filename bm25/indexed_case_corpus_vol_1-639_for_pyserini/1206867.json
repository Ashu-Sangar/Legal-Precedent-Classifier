{"id": "1206867", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxes,\nThis is an appeal -from' a judgment against the defendant in an action of ejectment.\nOn June 1, 1883, Anna B. Lyme, attempted to convey certain then unimproved premises identified as 2714 Canby Street, Penbrook, Dauphin County, to her husband, John H. Lyme. The husband did not join in this d\u00e9ed. It is, therefore, (as appellant concedes) void. See Wicker v. Durr, 225 Pa. 305, 74 A. 176, and Elder v. Elder, 256 Pa. 139, 100 A. 581. Subsequent to-the delivery of the deed to him,-the.husband entered into possession of the premises and constructed a small hofiSe and store' on the premises. His wife died intestate on, November 16, 1884! He continued to reside on the premises after her death until March 30, 1904, on which date he executed a conveyance of the premises by fee' simple deed to Annie C. Stoner. After other conveyances, the premises vested in the defendant, Andrew,. TJ, Reese, by deed dated; December 1, 1930 and promptly recorded. John H. Lyme died on January 16, 1939, and shortly thereafter Eva M. Dice, the only child of John H. and Anna B. Lyme, instituted this action of ejectment against the defendant. A jury was called and the plaintiff was the' only' witness. After she t\u00e9stifi\u00e9d, counsel for the respective parties agreed to certain facts and later agreed that the matter should be tried without a jury. The court made no specific findings of fact. : Its \u201cfinal order\u201d was that the defendant \u201cdeliver possession\u201d, of the premises, in. controversy \u201cto Eva M. Dice, the lawf\u00fal owner thereof.\u201d\n. It is:the contention of the appellee that at.the death of Anna B. Lyme,, the latter\u2019s husband, John H. Lyme, continued in possession of the premises^ by right of curtesy, that the deed from Anna B. Lyme to her husband conveyed np title,, and that when JohmH, Lym\u00e9 died the plaintiff, as. the heir at law. of. her mother^ became, the owner of the premises. .- : ..\nAppellant\u2019s contention, is that though , the deed of Anna B. Lyme to.fier husband was' void, it nevertheless, gave him .\u201ccolon of, title\u201d and that his possession of the premises prior to the death' of his wife was hosr tile to .the wife\u2019s title and' subsequent , to the. death of his wife it was. hostile to the heirs , of Anna B. Lyme, that his. possession, subsequent to-the death of .his-wife was not by right, of curtesy but under claim of right, and that under and by virtue of the. statute, cif limitations of March >26,. 1785, 2 Sm. L. 299, 12 PS 72, and the.Act of April 22, 1856, P. L. 582, 12.PS 82, title vested in the defendant. ;\nAppellant\u2019s contention must be. rejected. His basic error is the premise that he and= his predecessors , in title:held the property.in question by adverse possession. There was nothing adverse about appellant\u2019s possessi\u00f3n until after John H. Lyme died on January 16, 1939. \u2022 Lyme was in lawful possession of the premises of which his wife died seised, until March 30, 1904, when he conveyed Ms interest in these premises to Annie CL Stoner. Her right of possession thus acquired vested by divers conveyances in the appellant, as above noted. That John H. Lyme may have believed that he owned this land in fee simple by reason of his wife\u2019s deed to him bn June 1, 1883, does not affect in the slightest degree.the legal situation of these parties. \u201cColor of title\u201d contributes nothing to the fibre of title. In McCall v. Neely, 3 Watts 69, 72,- Chief Justice Gibson said: \u201cAn entry, is by color of title when it is made under a bona fide and not pretended-to claim to a title existing in another.\u201d In other words, the occupier of land-'.under \u201ccolor of title\u201d differs^ from an avowed squatter on land only in his state of mind. For example, an individual who t\u00e1kes and carries away another\u2019s personal property in the honest belief that it is his, has no felonious intent yet'the good faith which attended the taking is nb d\u00e9fense when the legal owner claims his property. \u201cColor bf title\u201d is merely the appearance of title without its reality. It saves its possessor only from the imputation of being a naked trespasser. The defendant and his predecessors in the occupancy of the land in question, back to and. including John H. Lyme, had the statuses neither of title holders nor trespassers. They were life tenants and as such were in lawful possession of the premises until John H. Lyme died. Their successive occupancies of these premises did not start the statute of limitations running against this plaintiff, for no principle of law is more firmly established than that the statute of limitations does not begin to run against an heir at law to a property held by one who occupies it as a tenant by the curtesy or as grantee of the tenant by the curtesy until the death of the tenant by the curtesy. The statute could not begin to run against the holder of the title until she had a right of entry.\nIn Ege v. Medlar, 82 Pa. 86, this court held that tenants \u201cholding under a tenant by curtesy could not be disturbed in their occupancy of the premises until his [1. e., the husband\u2019s] death. From the period the right of entry vested in the plaintiffs, and from that period only did the statute begin to run against them.\u201d As to the Act of 1856 (supra), this court said: \u201cIt is alleged that the Act of 1856 has introduced a different rule. Such however is not the case. That act does but affect the former rule as to persons of unsound mind,, married, women and minors, who, previously thereto, had ten years after the removaT of their several disabilities within which to bring suit against such as might have intruded upon th\u00e9ir right of entry ; now, however, by the statute above mentioned, the lapse of thirty years, from the time when such right of entry accrued, bars their right of action, though the disabilities therein referred to be not removed : Hunt v. Wall, 25 P. F. Smith 413. It will be observed, however, that the right of action in such persons is presupposed, for the-time runs from the period when the right of entry begins, but .where this right does not exist no action lies, and, hence, the statute can have-no \u25a0 effect. So, in the case in:hand, to say that the statute shall run from a date when the heirs of Elizabeth Ege had\u00a1 no right of entry, and consequently no right of action, is to say that they might be barred of such\u2019right by no default of their own and -without the possibility of remedy. . . .. It is not to be forgotten that mere color of title is valuable only so far as it indicates the extent of the disseisor\u2019s claim; if it fails in this, it fails altogether: Barnhart v. Pettit, 10 Harris 135.\u201d\nIn Marple v. Myers, 12 Pa. 122, this court held that prior to the death of the tenant by the curtesy, there was no moment-when the wife\u2019s heirs could have entered upon the land, without being trespassers; and therefore, there was no such right in them as the Statute of- Limitations could affect. In ' Lloyd\u2019s Est., 281 Pa. 379, 126 A. 806, this court, in an opinion by Justice Sadler, said: \u201cAppellee was not barred because he was not. entitled, to possession until 1924 when his father [the tenant by the curtesy] died, and was in no position to assert his-claim, if .any existed, until the preceding estate, had ended, and, therefore, the statute [of limitations.] could not: be applied because of failure to insist upon his ownership at an earlier date. During the continuance of life estate, one holding in remainder is. not bound to notice possession taken and continued by virtue of a conveyance, from the life tenant: Stahl v. Buffalo R. & P. Ry. Co, 262 Pa. 493 [106 A. 65]; Gernet v. Lynn, 31 Pa. 94.\u201d 21 C. J. p. 972, sec. 122, contains this statement': \u201cIt is .well settled that as a general rule the possession of a tenant for life is not adverse to the remainderman or reversioner. Nor does the .possession of the grantee of a tenant for life become adverse to -the remainderman or reversioner until after, the death of the life tenant, whether the conveyance purports .to transfer only , the life , estate or the title in fee simple.\u201d In 1 R. C. L. p, 743, sec. 63, appears this statement: \u201cThe possession of a tenant for life, as such, cannot be adverse to the remainderman or reversioner, because the right of action of the remainder-man or reversioner does not accrue until the death of the tenant for life. It has . been so held as to life tenants in right of dower, and by the curtesy.\u201d In Ontelaunee Orchards v. Rothcrmel, 139 Pa. Superior Ct. 44, that court, in an opinion by Judge Cunningham, said: \u201cAs between the grantees or-representatives of-a life tenant and the remaindermen, it is clear that the statute .of' limitations cannot run against the remaindermen until, after the death of the life tenant, for. not until then does the latter\u2019s right of action accrue,\u201d , (Citing cases.)\nIt was suggested that the plaintiff should have brought an action of ejectment against the\u2019 defendant because the. latter also held possession of the premises by \u201ccolor of title.\u201d This suggestion overlooks the fact that \u201cejectment is a possessory action only\u201d: Spangler v. Trogler, 228 Pa. 217, 228, 77 A. 495. In Harris v. Bell, 10 S. & R. 38, 42, this court said: \u201cEjectment is a possessory action; the right of possession may be in one, and the title to the property in another. One having the right of possession may recover in ejectment against him who has the right of property; for if the plaintiff shows himself to have been in the peaceable possession, and that he was forcibly dispossessed, it will enable him to recover, and the defendant cannot set up title in bar.\u201d (Citing cases.) In Heffner v. Betz, 32 Pa. 376, 378, we said: \u201cWhat is the purpose of this action [of ejectment] ? Certainly it is to try the present right of possession.\u201d In Wallace\u2019s Lessee v. Lewis, 4 Harr. (Del.) 75, it is said: \u201cThe action of ejectment necessarily supposes the defendant to be a trespasser.\u201d See also 7 Standard Enc. of Procedure, p. 982.\nIn his discussion of the writ of ejectment, Blackstone, Book III, p. 200, says: \u201cWe must recollect that the remedy by ejectment is in its original an action brought by one who hath a lease for years, to repair the injury done him by dispossession.\u201d He also refers, on page 202, to \u201can action of ejectment, in which the title of the lessor comes collaterally and incidentally before the court, in order to show the injury done the lessee by this ouster.\u201d Note 22, page 204 of Yol. 3 of Blackstone, reads as follows: \u201cIt has been determined that no ejectment can be maintained where the lessor of the plaintiff has not a legal right of entry; and the heir at law was barred from recovering in ejectment, where there was an unsatisfied term raised for the purpose of securing an annuity, though the heir claimed the estate subject to that charge.\u201d\nBouvier\u2019s Law Dictionary, Yol. 1, p. 636, defines \u201cejectment\u201d as \u201ca form of action by which possessory titles to corporeal hereditaments may be tried and possession obtained\u201d and as \u201ca form of action which lies to regain the possession of real property, with damages for the unlawful detention. ... It may be brought upon a right to an estate in fee-simple, fee-tail, for life, or for years, if only there be a right of entry and possession in the plaintiff.\u201d (Citing cases.)\nThe Act of March 8,1889, P. L. 10, sec. 1, as amended by the Act of April 16, 1903, P. L. 212, sec. 1 (12 PS see. 1543) provides: \u201cWhenever any person, not being in possession thereof, shall claim or have an apparent interest in or title to real estate, it shall be lawful for any person in possession thereof, claiming title to the same, to make application to the court of common pleas of the proper county, whereupon a rule shall be granted upon said person not in possession, to bring his or her action of ejectment within six months from the service of such rule upon him or her, .or show cause why the same cannot be so brought. ...\u201d\nIf the defendant wanted his title to the land in controversy to be litigated before the death of John H. Lyme in 1939, the duty of taking the initiative was his, as he was the \u201cparty in possession\u201d and it was he who challenged plaintiff\u2019s \u201cinterest in or title to\u201d that real estate.\nPlaintiff could gain nothing by bringing an action of ejectment against defendant before John H. Lyme\u2019s death, for \u201can action of ejectment is prematurely brought against one claiming under a life tenancy if brought before the death of such tenant\u201d: 9 B. C. L., sec. 23, p. 854. In an ejectment action started before the life tenant\u2019s death, plaintiff would not have been able to secure a judgment entitling her to possession of the premises in controversy. However, under the statute just above cited and under this court\u2019s decision in Clark v. Clark et al., 255 Pa. 574, 100 A. 457, the plaintiff could even before the death of Lyme have been compelled to bring an action of ejectment if defendant had, ruled her to do so. This initiative thus resting with the defendant was not taken.\nThe judgment is affirmed.\nSection 12 of the Act of March 26, 1785, provides: \u201cFrom hencjeforth no person or persons whatsoever shall make entry into any manors, lands, tenements of hereditaments, after the expiration of twenty-one years next after his, her or their rights or title' to the same first descended or accrued.\u201d \u25a0\nSection' 1 of. the Act of April 22, .1856, provides: \u201cNo. exception in any act of assembly respecting the limitation of actions in favor of persons non compos mentis, imprisoned, femes covert or minors, shall extend so as to permit any person to maintain any action for the recovery of any Ends or tenements, after thirty years shall have elapsed-since the right of entry thereto accrued, to any person within the .exceptions aforesaid.\u201d < \u2022 - \u25a0 \u25a0' .\u2022"}
