He made that claim before the return day of the writ, and in due form. The delay of the sheriff in causing the appraisement to be made, was not caused by the appellee, and his right to the benefit of the exemption ivas not thereby defeated. Although the appraisement was unduly postponed by the sheriff, yet ivben made, the benefits thereof vested in the appellee. He is not bound to resort to an action against the sheriff, but may claim the $300 out of the fund produced by a sale of the whole land : Seibert\u2019s Appeal, 23 P. F. Smith 359.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
