{"id": "1945683", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice O\u2019Bbien,\nThese appeals, consolidated for argument, are from various rulings of the Court of Common Pleas of Lackawanna County arising out of the election for county commissioners held on November 2, 1971.\nBefore reaching the merits of the controversy, we must resolve a question as to the scope of our review. Appellant contends that our review is on broad certiorari, while appellee argues that our review is limited to narrow certiorari, and, therefore, must concern itself only with questions of jurisdiction, the regularity of the proceedings, excess in the exercise of power and constitutional issues. The question arises because the original appeals from the Lackawanna County Return Board\u2019s conclusions were filed in the Court of Common Pleas pursuant to \u00a71407 of the Election Code, Act of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, art. XIV, \u00a71407, 25 P.S. \u00a73157. That section states that: \u201cNo appeal shall be allowed or granted from any order or decree of the court of common pleas made in pursuance of this section.\u201d Prior to the adoption of the new Pennsylvania Constitution in 1968 and the passage of the Act of December 2, 1968, P. L. , No. 351, \u00a7\u00a71-2, 12 P.S. \u00a7\u00a71111.1-1111.2 and the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of July 31, 1970, P. L. 673, art. I, \u00a7\u00a7101 et seq., 17 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7211.101 et seq., our review would indeed have been limited to narrow certiorari. That result, however, no longer obtains, since art. Y, \u00a79 of the new Constitution provides that: \u201c. . . there shall... be a right of appeal from a court of record ... to an appellate eourt, the selection of such court to be as provided by law. ...\u201d The question posed was determined by us in favor of review on broad certiorari in Millersville Annexation Case, 447 Pa. 310, 290 A. 2d 102 (1972), and that case is controlling in the instant situation.\nAppellant poses a series of questions concerning the computation and canvassing of the returns from the November 2, 1971, General Election and the several rulings of the Court of Common Pleas on his challenges to the conclusions reached by the County Election Return Board.\nAppellant complains:\n(1) That inadequate notice was given to voters who were, therefore, not afforded reasonable opportunity to defend the validity of their ballots against challenges thereto;\n(2) That where the reason for the challenge is not marked on the absentee ballot envelope, the challenge cannot be sustained;\n(3) That persons other than watchers are not authorized to challenge absentee ballots;\n(4) That there should have been a recount of the absentee ballots since there was insufficient proof to establish the probability of improper access to those ballots or the likelihood that they had been tampered with;\n(5) That the absentee ballots of certain patients of Ransom Convalescent Home, a public institution, should have been counted; and\n(6) That certain ballots declared invalid by reason of the way in which they were marked should have been counted.\nWe will not attempt in this opinion to discuss each of appellant\u2019s points. The court below has written a series of exhaustive opinions covering each of appellant\u2019s contentions, and we conclude that those opinions adequately and correctly dispose of all of appellant\u2019s arguments, with the exception of one point which we will discuss infra. Moreover, we have carefully reviewed the record in this case and find that the conclusions of the court below, with the one exception previously noted, are amply supported by the evidence.\nWe conclude, however, that the court beloAV erred in one respect. The error deals with six absentee ballots which were disallowed by the court below. Four of those absentee ballots were disallowed because the electors marked their respective ballots in red ink. We faced and decided that specific question in an appeal from decisions of the Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas in an election for school director which took place on the same day as the election which forms the basis for the case at bar. In Wieskerger Appeal, 447 Pa. 418, 290 A. 2d 108 (1972), an opinion filed by this Court on April 20, 1972, we held that absentee ballots marked in either red or green ink were properly counted. We there said: \u201cIn view of the prevalent use of multi-colored inks today, particularly in ballpoint pens easily accessible to all, we are not persuaded that the electors involved herein attempted by the use of red ink to render their ballots capable of identification.\u201d At page 421.\nThere is nothing in this record which differentiates the four ballots marked with red ink from the sixteen ballots marked in either red or green ink which we found to be valid in Wieskerger.\nThe other two absentee ballots which the court below refused to allow to be counted in this phase of the case were ballots in which the electors blocked out or completely filled in with ink the appropriate block or blocks for voting, rather than placing an \u201cx\u201d or \u201ccheck-mark\u201d in the appropriate block or blocks. Referring once again to Wieskerger, page 420, we there said: \u201cAs stated, in the Reading Election Recount Case, 410 Pa. 62 (1963): \u2018the power to throw out a ballot for minor irregularities should be sparingly used. It should be done only for very compelling reasons. . . . \u201cMarking a ballot in voting is a matter hot of precision engineering but of an unmistakable registration of the voter\u2019s will in substantial conformity to statutory requirement\u201d \u2019. In construing election laws while we must strictly enforce all provisions to prevent fraud our overriding concern at all times must be to be flexible in order to favor the right to vote. Our goal must be to enfranchise and not to disenfranchise [citing a case].\u201d\nWhile we were there concerned with ballots marked with red or green ink rather than the blue, black or blue-black ink as specified in the Election Code, the same rationale logically applies to ballots in which the appropriate blocks have been filled in rather than marked with an \u201cx\u201d or \u201ccheckmark\u201d as specified in the Code. In Wieskerger, at page 421, we said: \u201cThe proper interpretation of this portion of the statute considering the occasion for its enactment, the mischief to be remedied, and the policy to liberally construe voting laws in the absence of fraud, is that the ballot is valid unless there is a clear showing that the ink used was for the purpose of making the ballot identifiable.\u201d\nWe conclude, therefore, that unless there is a clear showing that the filling in of the blocks was for the purpose of making the ballots identifiable, those ballots,, too, are valid. Just as Millersville Annexation Case, supra, is controlling on the scope of our review. Wieskerger Appeal, supra, is controlling on the question of the six ballots specifically referred to above.\nThe orders of the court below are modified to the extent that the six ballots hereinabove specifically referred to are directed to be counted and, as modified, are affirmed.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones, Mr. Justice Eagen, Mr. Justice Nix and Mr. Justice Manderino concur in the result."}
