(1965) 1580, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq., 19 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1180-1 et seq. Finding no error in the order of the PCHA court denying appellant\u2019s petition, we affirm.\nOn April 19, 1965, appellant pleaded guilty to murder generally. After a two day hearing, he was adjudicated guilty of murder of the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. Appellant took no appeal from judgment of sentence. On April 11, 1966, appellant filed his first PCHA petition. The petition was denied after a hearing and appellant took no appeal.\nIn his second PCHA petition, filed January 8, 1969, appellant raised several issues. Most pertinent here is appellant\u2019s assertion that his guilty plea was induced by the prosecutor\u2019s promise to place a letter in appellant\u2019s file recommending commutation after ten years of appellant's life sentence. Appellant contended that the prosecutor\u2019s failure to comply with this agreement provided a ground for withdrawal of the plea. The PCHA court rejected this claim, finding that\n\u201c2. There was no plea bargaining in which the court participated and the defendant was informed and said he understood that the court had made no commitment, promise or guarantee of leniency;\n3. Petitioner\u2019s plea of guilty was not induced by a promise that he would be released from incarceration within 10 years.\u201d\nAdditionally appellant claimed that he had not been informed of his right to appeal from judgment of sentence. On this ground the eourt granted him the opportunity to appeal as though timely filed. See Douglas v. California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963); Commonwealth ex rel. Light v. Cavell, 422 Pa. 215, 220 A.2d 883 (1966); Commonwealth ex rel. Cunningham v. Maroney, 421 Pa. 157, 218 A.2d 811 (1966). Appellant then took such an appeal to this Court. He did not contest the PCHA court\u2019s adverse ruling on his commutation claim. Instead, appellant argued that his guilty plea should be vacated because of his incompetency to enter a guilty plea, counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, and an invalid arrest. This Court denied relief. Commonwealth v. Brown, 443 Pa. 21, 275 A.2d 332 (1971). Our determination as to these claims is final and conclusive.\nIn the third and present petition, appellant again seeks post conviction relief on the ground that his guilty plea was unlawfully induced by the prosecutor\u2019s alleged promise to recommend commutation. The PCHA court held that this issue cannot now be raised in this PCHA proceeding because it was \u201cfinally litigated\u201d upon adjudication of appellant\u2019s second PCHA petition. See 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-4(a)(l). We agree. The Post Conviction Hearing Act directs that a \u201cfinally litigated\u201d claim cannot be relitigated. See 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-3(d); Commonwealth v. Hill, 457 Pa. 1, 8, 319 A.2d 886, 890 (1974). An issue raised under the PCHA is \u201cfinally litigated\u201d if it was disposed of in a prior PCHA petition, and the petitioner knowingly and understanding^ failed to appeal that disposition. See 19 P.S. \u00a7 1180-4(a)(l); Commonwealth v. James, 442 Pa. 362, 276 A.2d 505 (1971). There is and indeed can be no dispute that the commutation claim now urged by appellant in his third petition was adjudicated by the PCHA court in his second petition, and that appellant knowingly and understanding^ failed to appeal that adjudication.\nAppellant seeks to avoid the bar of finality by asserting that his commutation claim did not become ripe for judicial resolution until he served ten years of his sentence. Thus, contends appellant, the second PCHA court, which heard appellant\u2019s claim only four and one-half years after imposition of sentence, lacked jurisdiction to consider the merits of his commutation claim. Appellant, however, advances no just or acceptable basis for permitting him presently to raise his \u201cripeness\u201d claim. Appellant initiated the very proceeding he now attacks. Appellant suggests no circumstance which prevented him from interposing this objection during the second PCHA proceeding. No interest of justice \u2014 procedural or substantive \u2014 would be promoted by now permitting relitigation of the commutation claim.\nIn any event, appellant\u2019s ripeness argument lacks merit. This Court has held that, based on considerations of fairness and judicial economy, a \u201cwrit of habeas corpus may be sought in postconviction attacks on the validity of a final judgment of conviction even though the petitioner has not yet begun to serve the sentence imposed.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Stevens v. Myers, 419 Pa. 1, 20, 213 A.2d 613, 624 (1965); see Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U.S. 54, 88 S.Ct. 1549, 20 L.Ed.2d 426 (1968) (prisoner may use habeas corpus to challenge the validity of the second of two consecutive sentences while serving the first in order to minimize the chances of disappearing witnesses and dimmed memories). So too, considerations of fairness and judicial economy permitted the PCHA court in 1969 to decide appellant\u2019s second PCHA petition on the merits. The record demonstrates that the prosecutor disputed appellant\u2019s claim that an agreement had been entered which induced the guilty plea. Appellant\u2019s commutation claim was therefore ripe at the time of his second PCHA proceeding. It is clear that the fact-finder at that proceeding upon sufficient evidence rejected appellant\u2019s commutation claim. That determination is final and conclusive.\nThe order of the PCHA court is affirmed.\n. Counsel has been made available to appellant at every stage of this case.\n. Appellant sought a writ of habeas corpus in federal court after this Court in 1971 denied relief. According to appellant, a federal magistrate refused to consider his commutation claim because it was \u201cpremature.\u201d This Court, of course, is not in any respect bound by that view."}
