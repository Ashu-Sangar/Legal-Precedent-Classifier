{"id": "1024023", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis action is upon an award of an arbitrator under a common law submission. The terms of submission, signed by the appellant, are plain and unambiguous, and, as the arbitrator clearly acted within the scope of the authority committed to him, his award is \u201cwith no right of appeal\u201d in the appellant. The averments in his affidavit of defense are unavailing to defeat the appellee\u2019s right to recover. The judgment is, therefore, affirmed."}
