{"id": "1206961", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nThis appeal, on behalf of minor remaindermen, is from a decree refusing to surcharge trustees for losses resulting from their failure to convert non-legal investments which had been received from themselves at the adjudication of their account as executors. Testator died September 13, 1930, leaving a will dated January 27, 1930, with a codicil dated June 2, 1930. After directing the payment of debts, disposing of household effects, giving a number of cash legacies, creating three trusts of $5,000 each for grandchildren, directing the payment of taxes and the sale of his interest in a partnership, he disposed of the residue to his executors and trustees to pay the net income to his daughter for life, then to distribute the corpus to her children and his nephews and nieces in contingencies which need not now be stated.\nAmong testator\u2019s investments passing to the executors were non-legals, of which they sold only a part. At the adjudication of the executors\u2019 account in October, 1931, they received the unconverted non-legals as trustees. In 1939, pursuant to the application of the life beneficiary, they filed their first account; at the audit, requests for surcharge were made and allowed; after argument on exceptions to the adjudication the surcharges were affirmed. Later, reargument was allowed, after which a majority of the judges sustained the exceptions to the adjudication, and refused the surcharge.\nThe general rule is that the trustee must exercise common prudence, common skill and common caution in the performance of his duties, or, shortly stated, due care in the circumstances. The field of investment defined by the statute may be enlarged by the will, by acquiescence of beneficiaries, or in certain cases by order of court. If the testator directs an investment in a particular security it must be made, if available. If investments become non-legal or if nonlegal investments are received without authority to retain them, they must be converted into legals with reasonable diligence. The rule to be applied to this record was considered in Taylor\u2019s Estate, 277 Pa. 518, 121 A. 310 (1923), in Brown\u2019s Estate, 287 Pa. 499, 135 A. 112 (1926), and in more recent cases, among them, Nola\u2019s Estate, 333 Pa. 106, 3 A. 2d 326 (1939). In Brown\u2019s Estate, we said, at p. 501: \u201cThe rule stated in Taylor\u2019s Estate as to such securities was that a fiduciary should not hold beyond a reasonable period investments made by the decedent in unauthorized securities unless specially authorized to do so, and that when a trustee continues to hold such non-legal investments after a time when he could properly dispose of them and a loss occurs, he must be held liable for a failure to exercise due care; unless he shows that his retention of the securities in question represents, not a mere lack of attention, hut am, honest exercise of judgment based on actual consideration of existing conditions; in other words, he is expected to be ordinarily watchful and to exercise normal good judgment: Taylor\u2019s Estate, [277 Pa. 518] at page 528.\u201d 9This accords with the requirement of section 49 (e) 2 of the Fiduciaries\u2019 Act of 1917, P. L. 447. in Nola\u2019s Estate, the opinion\nstated at p. 109: \u201cIf a decedent dies leaving securities which would not be legal investments for trust funds, the fiduciary is excused from a failure to convert them if his retaining them represents \u2018the honest exercise of judgment based on actual consideration of existing conditions ; in other words, he is expected to be ordinarily watchful and to exercise normally good judgment.\u2019 (Taylor\u2019s Estate, 277 Pa. 518, 528; Brown\u2019s Estate, 287 Pa. 499; Curran\u2019s Estate, 312 Pa. 416, 423, 424; Reinhard\u2019s Estate, 322 Pa. 325). He is thus vested by the law with a measure of discretion and is allowed the exercise of his own judgment as to the wisdom of selling the securities under then prevailing market conditions.\u201d See, also, Restatement, Trusts, \u00a7 174.\nAs the trustees were not authorized to retain the nonlegal investments, it was their duty to convert with reasonable diligence, which means within a reasonable time considering the circumstances; to perform that duty required them to determine what would be a reasonable time. While the dictionaries give a number of meanings for the word reasonable, in a legal sense conduct is reasonable if it is consistent with that of the prudent man in like circumstances. These trustees, then, whether advised that they should not hold the investments \u201cbeyond a reasonable period\u201d (Taylor\u2019s Estate, 277 Pa. 518, 528, 121 A. 310) or that they should \u201cuse reasonable diligence in converting\u201d (section 49 (e) 2, Fiduciaries\u2019 Act, 1917, P. L. 516) or that they should dispose of them \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d (Restatement, Trusts, section 230) were bound to conform to the prudent man standard. The required conduct must be considered with respect to the necessities, as they appeared at the time of the proposed transactions; obviously, for example, if there is no market, the trustees cannot sell. If, temporarily, the appellees retained the investments, awaiting what they should consider a proper time to sell, they assumed the burden of justifying their decision; in the words of the rul\u00e9, the record must show that their retention of the securities represented, not a mere lack of attention, but an honest exercise of judgment based on actual consideration of existing conditions. An examination of the record requires our concurrence in the decree appealed from.\nThe appellant has printed the evidence of two witnesses, John Casani, one of the trustees, and William H. Loesche, a trust officer of the Girard Trust Company. For present purposes it is conceded that, as executors, the appellees were justified in retaining the investments until they filed their account in 1931; the learned auditing judge said that he was \u201cnot . . . prepared to say that these securities should have been sold by the trustees before the audit of that account.\u201d As the Fiduciaries\u2019 Act, section 49 (e) 1 and 2 provided that \u201cfor reasons satisfactory to said court\u201d securities might be awarded in kind, the distribution in kind to the trustees was properly made.\nWe come, then, to the evidence offered by the trustees to show the exercise of reasonable diligence in their endeavors to ascertain whether a time for sale had come at a price which should have been taken and in concluding that it had not; or, that the temporary retention, in the words of the rule, was not the result of mere:lack of-attention-but the product of the honest exercise of judgment based on actual consideration of existing Conditions. Mr. Casani testified -that he followed- the market constantly and considered the fluctuating prices., \u2022 He , consulted about the investments with various persons connected with banks and brokers; he also consulted with S. Davis Wilson, then Controller of Philadelphia, with particular reference to the Union Traction. Company stock, Mr. Wilson being then concerned in the Philadelphia street railway litigation. \u25a0 To quote only one of the instances given in the .evidence, Mr. Casani testified, with respect to the investments generally: \u201cQ. What kind of information were you. getting from him? [a named broker]. A. What I was trying to get from these people all the time was that we had seen stock go below our appraisal .figure. We knew it was non-legal and what we were trying to find out was if we could procure a judgment of what he would recommend us to do other than what we were -doing with it. \u25a0 Nobody was telling us, \u2018You go out and sell it\u2019; everybody was of the opinion \u2018These are good stocks; they will come back.\u2019 What we tried to do was to eliminate the sacrifice of assets in this estate.\u201d He said that both the trustees were following the quotations of these securities and watching them in the daily papers and investment journals. \u25a0\nIn .1931 the trustees made an oral arrangement with the Girard Trust Company, .the purport of which was thus stated.by Mr. Loesche, trust officer, of that company. \u201cA. We entered into an agency agreement, where we have all the custody of the securities, collect income, and make the investments and reinvestments as they may direct.' Agency service includes consultations with our trust officers concerning the assets of the estate.\u201d The trustees did not delegate power to the trust company;, \u201ceverything in the handling of the trusts was -done on their approval only.\u201d Among the duties performed were looking after the real estate, keeping accounts, collecting income. and' distributing it to the life tenant accompanied by appropriate states ments. For this service the trust. company received 3% of the .5% charged for collecting the income, each of the trustees receiving 1%. The arrangement \u25a0 with the Trust Company continued during the entire,period covered by the account. Mr. Casani testified:. \u201cWhen we talked to the Girard Trust Company about the po: sition we were in they advised us to hold these securities,\u201d Mr. Loesche said, apparently speaking, as, of December, 1931, of the U. G. I. stock, .\u201cI remember saying to them I thought that.was..rather a sound stock; it was a rather, large part of the estate, and probably the market conditions did not warrant selling at that particular time.\u201d , He said that he \u201chad many discussions with them relative to this estate.\u201d \u2022 Mr. Casani testified that his reason for not selling the TJ. G. I. stock was that \u201cin our judgment, for us- to sell that stock would be to sacrifice a considerable asset, and we also felt that if we disposed of that. stock for that price, which in our judgment was too low, and we re-invested in legal investments, the only ones that we would have considered, Federal bonds, that our income would have suffered a shrinkage and so we decided, felt in our judgment the thing to do, to protect the estate and also to protect the income, was to hold the -TJ. G. I. stock.\u201d He said substantially the same thing of the General Electric Company stock, that \u201cat thirty-one that it was too low and we would be sacrificing an asset to have sold it, and it would have reduced the income for the life tenant.\u201d There are similar expressions of their ultimate conclusions concerning other investments. We have of course not quoted all the evidence on the subject but it shows a\u2019case within the rule; their \u201cretention of the securities in question represents, not a mere lack of attention, but an honest exercise of judgment based on actual consideration of existing conditions.\u201d These trustees, it may be noted, were selected by the testator to carry out the purposes of the trust; one of them, Mr. Casani, was testator\u2019s nephew, engaged in business with him, and entitled to share in the remainder after the life estate, an interest that he would wish to protect. As the learned court has found that, in the honest exercise of judgment in conditions presented from time to time as disclosed by the record, they refrained from selling because they thought sales then would be at an unreasonable sacrifice in respect of both principal and income, they have complied with the rule.\nArguments in this and other surcharge cases at this Term appear to indicate that the decision in Beamans\u2019 Estate, 333 Pa. 358, 5 A. 2d 208, has been misunderstood. In that case, as' in this, the accountant had the burden of justifying his conduct; after considering his evidence, the court found \u201cno adequate excuse for appellant\u2019s retention of the stocks ever since 1930.\u201d From that finding of fact liability followed as of course. That was the decision. The apparent misunderstanding of it appears to result from expressions selected from the opinion which certainly were not intended by the court to modify the rule as theretofore applied. In the opinion, the words \u201cpromptly\u201d and \u201cprompt\u201d were used in referring to the general rule requiring conversion; the words \u201cto some extent\u201d were added in a sentence which, in Nola's Estate, 333 Pa. 106, 109, 3 A. 2d 326, read as follows: \u201cHe is thus vested by the law with a measure of discretion and is allowed the exercise of his own judgment as to the wisdom of selling the securities under then prevailing market conditions,\u201d so that it read \u201cand allowed to some extent to exercise his own judgment\u201d etc. Apparently, also some of the misunderstanding results from the fact that one year after the guardian received the securities at the audit of the executor\u2019s account was fixed as the date when the replacement value of the securities should be calculated. It has been argued that the rule referred to in Taylor's Estate, Brown's Estate and Hola's Estate, supra, was modified by the decision in Seamans' Estate. The words \u201cpromptly\u201d at page 363, and \u201cprompt\u201d at page 364, used in the opinion in Seamans' Estate, and the addition of the words \u201cto some extent\u201d page 363, were not intended by the court to be given the effect suggested by counsel. In Dauler\u2019s Estate, for example, 247 Pa. 356, 93. A. 511, the accountant, an executor, was not surcharged though he held the securities six years without finding a market; in Bernhard's Estate, 322 Pa. 325, 185 A. 298, bank stock was held from 1930 until the bank failed in 1932; in Stewart's Appeal, 110 Pa. 410, 6 A. 321, railroad stock was held four years. While it is true that an executor should account in a year and may be required by the court to convert in a year for the purpose of then making distribution, the rule we are considering is that to be applied by a trustee after he has received the trust property at the audit of the executor\u2019s account.\nThe finding of the court in banc was as follows: \u201cThe record is replete with uncontradicted proof that [the trustees] consistently sought expert advice as to the wisdom of selling or retaining \u2014 always with the best interest and protection of the estate in mind. After the award to them as trustees in October, 1931, they continued this attention. In December, 1931, they entered into \u00e1n agency agreement with one of th\u00e9 largest and soundest trust companies in order to \u2018collaborate\u2019 with experienced men; they voluntarily surrendered to that company 3% of their 5% commission for this service. Not- only did the trustees constantly and continuously consult with the officers and employees of the trust company, but they consulted other bankers, brokers, and a City official \u2014 all of whom advised and evidently still -advise against conversion. At no time is- it apparent in the testimony that the retention by the trustee was by way of speculation, and to hold on in order to receive a better price than the securities were reasonably worth. Upon the contrary, the testimony reveals that the retention was a bona fide effort to retain until such time as a sale of the securities would realize what the Trustees deemed to be their true value. However. mistaken their judgment may have proven \u2014 - a hindsight which may not be substituted for foresight\u2014 there can be no question that these fiduciaries, to the best of their ability, and with the assistance of the best advice they could- obtain, acted with common skill, common prudence and common caution.\u201d There is no contradiction of importance in the evidence.\nDecree affirmed, costs to be paid out of principal.\nMr. Justice Parker concurs in the result.\nMr. Justice Drew and Mr. Justice Stern dissent.\n$6,000 4% General Consolidated Mortgage Gold Bonds, due 2003, of the Lehigh Yalley Railroad Company, 50 shares General Electric Company Common, 200 shares Deposited Bank Shares, Series B. 1, 962 shares U.

A fiduciary is not compelled to jettison seasoned investments during a temporary panic.\u201d See, also, Gardner\u2019s Estate, 323 Pa. 229, 236, 185 A. 804."}
