{"id": "12280223", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 29th day of February, 2016, upon review of Petitioner\u2019s Substituted Petition for Allowance of Appeal, which the Commonwealth has not opposed, we find as follows: The Superior Court deemed Petitioner\u2019s claims before that tribunal to have been waived for Petitioner\u2019s failure to include the relevant notes of testimony in the original record, and then granted Petitioner\u2019s motion to supplement the record and issued an order deeming the submitted notes of testimony to be part of the certified record. The Superior Court erred, however, in then failing to grant Petitioner\u2019s application for reconsideration of the merits of his waived claims. Accordingly, Petitioner\u2019s Substituted Petition for Allowance, wherein Petitioner seeks a remand to the Superior Court for merits review of his claims on appeal, is hereby GRANTED, the order of the Superior Court is VACATED, and this matter is REMANDED to the Superior Court for consideration of the merits of Petitioner\u2019s claims on appeal.\nMr. Justice Eakin did not participate in the decision of this matter."}
