{"id": "1036633", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, January 26th 1874, by\nAgnew, C. J.\nWe perceive no error in this decree.- The bequest to Martha, the wife of John Bartholomew, in the codicil to the testator\u2019s will, was evidently a revocation of that to John in the original will. The fact that she is John\u2019s wife does not change her right, and make her legacy liable to John\u2019s debts to the testator. It is not a case of legal substitution, whereby one person becomes substituted to the right of another by operation of law, but it is a case of change in the intention of the testator, whereby he suffered one person to drop out of his will and another to fall in. The very change of intention contradicts the idea of mere substitution. John was left to stand where he stood before, a debtor to the estate, and Martha was given 'the bequest in, her own right, not in his. Judge Butler\u2019s opinion is quite satisfactory.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs."}
