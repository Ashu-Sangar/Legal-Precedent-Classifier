{"id": "467431", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Lawrence County overruling certain exceptions to the decree of distribution entered upon the adjudication upon audit of the first and final account of Lawrence Savings and Trust Company, successor trustee under the last will and testament of Bes L. Lusk, who died testate May 8,1931. The question presented by this appeal is: Does the testator\u2019s will clearly express an intent that his heirs who were to take at the termination of his testamentory trust are to be determined as of the time of that termination and not as of the time of his death? The court b\u00e9low held that the ninth paragraph of. the testator\u2019s will meant that the distribution to be made at the time of the contingency specified was to be made to those who were the heirs at the date of the testator\u2019s death.\nThe ninth paragraph of the will reads as follows: \u201cIn case of the death of my son, Donald Augustus Lusk, before the death of his mother, and in case of the death of my grandson, Donald Campbell Lusk, before he reaches the age of thirty years, then I direct that my estate, real, personal and mixed, subject to the bequests hereinbefore given to Mary Helen Lusk, shall revert back to my original estate and be distributed under the intestate laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\u201d\nDonald Augustus Lusk died July 2, 1935 and his mother died on April 21, 1939. The testator\u2019s grandson, Donald Campbell Lusk, died on August 24, 1944, at the age of twenty-five years. Under these facts, the testator\u2019s entire estate \u201creverted back\u201d (according to testator\u2019s directions), to his \u201coriginal estate\u201d for distribution \u201cunder the intestate laws of Pennsylvania\u201d.\nThe Act of June 29,1923, P. L. 914, 21 P.S. 11, Sec. 1, declares that: \u201cHereafter when, in and by the provisions of any deed or will or other instrument in writing, property, either real or personal, or both, shall be donated, granted, devised, or bequeathed, either directly or in trust, for the use and benefit of any person, charity, or other use, for years or for life or upon condition, and which shall provide therein that, upon the termination of the estate for years or for life or upon breach of condition or other cause, the remainder over shall vest in the donor\u2019s or testator\u2019s heirs or next of kin or the persons thereunto entitled under the intestate laws, or other similar or equivalent phrase, the same shall be construed as meaning the person or persons thereunto entitled at the time of the termination of the estate for years or for life or upon condition under the intestate laws of the Commonwealth as they shall exist at the time of such termination; and such phrases shall not be construed as meaning the person or persons who were the heirs or next of kin of the donor at the time the grant or donation was made or at the time the testator died: Provided, however, That nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent any donor or testator from expressly or by necessary implication directing otherwise: And provided further, That the provisions of this act shall not apply to any case now pending.\u201d\nThe court below held that this testator did \u201cdirect otherwise\u201d. The court said that the testator \u201cdid not mean the tide of descent to move forward; he meant it to move back. He said, to his \u2018original estate5, intending thereby to have his heirs determined as of the time when his estate [as an inheritance] had its origin, i.e. upon his own demise.\u201d\nThe verb \u201crevert55 ordinarily means \u201cto return55; for example, when it is used in biology, it means to return to or toward some ancestral type; when it is used in chemistry, it means to return to a former state. This testator when he used the words \u201crevert back to my original estate\u201d, clearly meant that when the time should come for the distribution of his estate, upon the happening of the contingencies specified, thereby causing the termination of the trust eseate, it should be distributed exactly as it would have been distributed in its \u201coriginal55 condition on the date of his death, that is, in the form it had before any testamentary estates were carved out of it.\nIn Smith\u2019s Petition, 291 Pa. 129, 137; 139 A. 832, this court said: \u201cThe legal signification of \u2018revert5 is for property to go back to and lodge in a former owner, who parted with it by creating an estate in another, which has expired (Words and Phrases, 2d ed. 6213; Anderson Law Dictionary, 899 . . .\u201d In the instant case the property was to \u201cgo back\u201d to the former \u201cintact\u201d condition and be distributed under the intestate laws exactly as it would have been distributed had it always been \u201cintact\u201d, i.e* not \u201cbroken\u201d by life estates which later ended on the happening of certain contingencies. The case of Downing v. Grigsby, 251 Ill. 568, 96 N.E. 513 involved the construction of a will in which a testator devised the homestead to his wife for life and then provided that \u201cat her death to revert to my estate\u201d. The court said: \u201c. . . The ordinary meaning of the words \u2018revert to my estate\u2019 is to return to the aggregate of all the property which I may leave at my death.\u201d In Cochran v. Lee\u2019s Admr., Ky., 84 S.W. 337, it is stated that the word \u201crevert\u201d as used in a will providing that if \u201cany of my children die without issue . . . his or her portion shall revert to my estate for the benefit of the living heirs\u201d, means to come back or return and that if any of the children die without issue, his or her portion shall return to the estate for the benefit of the living heirs.\nThe decision in Bonsall\u2019s Est., 288 Pa. 39, 135 A. 724, cited by appellant, is not inconsistent with the decision reached in the instant case. There a testatrix in her will provided for \u201cthe creation of a trust of one-half of the residuary estate, the income from which was to be paid to a granddaughter, Florence Bonsall Judge, during life; upon her death the principal was to go to her child or children, but if she should die \u2018without leaving child or children surviving or children of deceased child or children, then and in such case the principal monies of said Trust Fund shall go to and vest in my lineal descendants according to the intestate laws of the State of Pennsylvania.\u2019 \u201d The granddaughter named did die without leaving any children. This court held that \u201cthe lineal descendants\u201d were to be ascertained as of the date of the death of the life beneficiary. The decision construed the will according to the Act of June 29, 1923, P. L. 914, for it was clear that the testatrix did not direct otherwise. In the instant case, it is equally clear that the testator did direct otherwise.\nIt might be added (though it is not necessary to the decision of this case) that when Bes L. Lusk wrote his will on December 27, 1922, the applicable rule of construction was in a case of this character exactly as it is set forth in the opinion of this court in McFillin\u2019s Est., 235 Pa. 175, 83 A. 620, as follows: \u201cThe thoroughly settled rule of construction is that where a testator directs that in a certain event after the expiration of a particular interest the estate shall go to his heirs or next of kin, or to the persons who would take under the intestate laws, he is to be understood as meaning the persons who would have so taken at the time of his death, and not at the time appointed for their taking, unless a different intent is plainly manifested in his will: Buzby\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa. 111; Stewart\u2019s Estate, 147 Pa. 383; Fitzpatrick\u2019s Estate, 233 Pa. 33.\u201d See also Barnard Est., 351 Pa. 313, 41 A. 578; and Wood v. Schoen, 216 Pa. 425, 66 A. 79. The lawyer who drafted the Lusk will undoubtedly knew that if his client wished the remainder of his estate, after the termination of the trust estates, upon the happening of the contingencies named, to vest in those who were his heirs at the time of the termination of the trust estate, it would be necessary to \u201cplainly manifest\u201d this intent in the will. No such intent is so manifested in the Lusk will. On the contrary, what is plainly manifested is the testator\u2019s intent that when the trust estate ended, his estate should be distributed exactly as it would have been on the date of his death, had there been no trust estates; it was on the date of his death that the testator\u2019s testamentary estate originated. The use of the phrase \u201coriginal estate\u201d in the ninth paragraph of his will, is of decisive significance in this case.\nNeither the testator nor his attorney could, when this will Avas executed on December 27, 1922, have anticipated the passage of the Act of June 29, 1923, supra, which changed the rule of construction (or the presumption) in this class of cases, but if they had done so and had known that the will then being executed would be governed by that Act (because of the maker\u2019s death subsequent to that Act), they could not have used language much more explicit than they did use, to express the testator\u2019s intent that upon the happening of the contingencies set forth in paragraph 9, the distribution of the estate should be made as of the date of the testator\u2019s death, that is, it should be made to those who at that date were his legal heirs under the intestate laws of this Commonwealth.\nThe appeal is dismissed at the appellant\u2019s cost."}
