{"id": "905140", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe court below was clearly right in holding that, under the will of Richard Shoup, his son Thomas, the plaintiff, took an estate in fee tail, which under the act of 1855, became a fee simple. This conclusion is sustained by numerous authorities; but the principle involved is so familiar that citations are unnecessary. It follows that there was no error in entering judgment in favor of the plaintiff on the case stated.\nJudgment affirmed."}
