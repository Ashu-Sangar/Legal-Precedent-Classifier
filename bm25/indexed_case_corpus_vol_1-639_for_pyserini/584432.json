{"id": "584432", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThe single, narrow issue presented by this appeal is whether a settlor may impose upon our courts the task of monitoring his wish that no person serve as an individual trustee of an irrevocable inter vivos charitable trust, if that person is married to a non-Protestant. We conclude that settlor\u2019s partiality for the religious persuasion of the trustees\u2019s spouses is irrelevant both to the competency of a trustee and to the proper administration of the trust, and is therefore unenforceable.\nHorace C. Coleman (settlor) on December 26, 1935, created the Coleman Foundation, an irrevocable inter vivos trust. The net income of the Foundation was to be distributed by the trustees to charities. Settlor died in 1936.\nSettlor designated as trustees his son, Horace C. Coleman, Jr.; his secretary, Eleanor Klernm; a friend, Rev. Jesse M. Corum, Jr.; and a corporate fiduciary. In 1955, Reverend Corum resigned and settlor\u2019s other son, John M. Coleman, became a trustee.\nSettlor also described who could become or remain a trustee. The provision engendering the instant controversy states: \u201cNo person shall be appointed a Trustee of this trust unless he, and his wife, if he is a married man, are both of the Protestant faith; should a person of the Protestant faith be appointed a Trustee and subsequently change his faith, or should he marry one who is not a Protestant, or should he marry one who is a Protestant and she subsequently change her faith, then he shall automatically resign his trusteeship.\u201d\nThis proceeding began on May 5, 1971, with the filing of the second account of the Coleman Foundation. The reason for its filing was the appointment as trustee of Anne Coleman Mamana, a granddaughter of settlor. A petition seeking court approval of her appointment was filed by John M. Coleman, her father, in his capacity as chairman of the board of trustees and in his own behalf as trustee. The petition recites that Anne Coleman Mamana \u201cis married to John P. Mamana, who is Roman Catholic,\u201d and further that she has been appointed trustee by the board, \u201csubject to the approval of the court.\u201d\nSome time later, Horace C. Coleman, Jr., petitioned the court to be discharged from further duties as trustee. His reason for resigning was that \u201c[h]e did on Monday, July 19, 1971 marry a person who is a Catholic.\u201d The petition stated that he had already submitted his resignation to the board, because he believed the trust provision at issue here compelled his resignation.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County denied the petition for appointment of Anne Coleman Mamana and approved the petition for the resignation of Horace Coleman. It concluded that because Anne Coleman Mamana and Horace Coleman were admittedly married to non-Protestants, both were prohibited by the language of settlor\u2019s trust from serving as trustees of the Coleman Foundation. Appeals urging reversal were taken by both the Foundation and the Commonwealth as parens patriae. We reverse.\nIt is commonplace that \u201cour courts, in their control over trustees who hold for charitable uses, exercise the broad visitorial and supervisory powers of the Commonwealth . . . .\u201d Toner\u2019s Estate, 260 Pa. 49, 54, 103 A. 541, 543 (1918); see McKee Estate, 378 Pa. 607, 108 A.2d 214 (1954) (per curiam); Wilson v. Board of Directors, 324 Pa. 545, 550-51, 188 A. 588, 591-92 (1936); Stevens\u2019s Estate, 200 Pa. 318, 322-24, 49 A. 985, 986-87 (1901) (per curiam); John C. Mercer Home v. Fisher, 162 Pa. 239, 29 A. 733 (1894); Lehigh University v. Hower, 159 Pa. Superior Ct. 84, 93, 46 A.2d 516, 520-21 (1946) ; Laverelle Estate, 101 Pa. Superior Ct. 448, 451-52 (1931). Implicit in that power is the responsibility to administer trusts, especially charitable trusts, in a just, speedy, and inexpensive fashion. See Mellon Estate, 455 Pa. 294, 298-99, 314 A.2d 500, 502-03 (1974); Girt Estate, 452 Pa. 156, 164 n.7, 305 A.2d 372, 377 n.7 (1973); cf. Pa. O.C.R \u00a7 2, rule 1.\nLitigation spawned by a settlor\u2019s preference bearing no relation to the proper administration of trusts, dissipates trust assets, unduly burdens the judicial process, and unnecessarily delays other litigants from their day in court. See James Estate, 414 Pa. 80, 199 A.2d 275 (1964). See also Franklin\u2019s Estate, 150 Pa. 437, 24 A. 626 (1892); Holdeen v. Ratterree, 292 F.2d 338 (2d Cir. 1961); Franklin Foundation v. Attorney General, 340 Mass. 197, 163 N.E.2d 662 (1960). The time, expense, and effort involved in achieving judicial resolution of a controversy is already substantial. To permit or encourage the litigation of irrelevant trust notions, like the instant one, not only diverts trust assets from charities, but also frustrates the Commonwealth\u2019s policy favoring the prompt, orderly, and efficient administration of trusts. It follows, therefore, that public policy does not permit a settlor to burden the judicial system with the responsibility to keep watch over every one of his personal vagaries that is unrelated to any proper trust purpose. Our jurisprudence does not require that judicial significance be attached to all manifestations of a settlor\u2019s whimsy.\nSettlor attempted to make the religious belief of trustees\u2019s spouses a condition of eligibility for service as a trustee. The judicial enforcement of settlor\u2019s wish will not result in the selection of better trustees, or improve the performance of existing trustees. It will not expedite the administration of the trust. We fail to see how the religious persuasion of an individual trustee\u2019s spouse has any more bearing on his service as trustee, than the religious persuasion of the spouse of the trust officer acting for the Foundation\u2019s corporate fiduciary has on his service.\nA charitable trust is initially and continuously subject to the parens patriae power of the Commonwealth and the supervisory jurisdiction of its courts. \u201cThe responsibility for public supervision [of charitable trusts] traditionally has been delegated to the attorney general to be performed as an exercise of his parens patriae powers.\u201d Pruner Estate, 390 Pa. 529, 532, 136 A.2d 107, 109 (1957). See Pa. O.O.R. \u00a7 5, rule 5. Moreover, the orphans\u2019 court has plenary power to ensure the competency and performance of trustees. Trustees of a charitable trust are fiduciaries, and as such are officers of the orphans\u2019 court, subject to its exclusive supervision and control. Act of August 10, 1951, P.L. 1163, art. III, \u00a7 301(6), 20 P.S. \u00a7 2080.301(6) (1964) (now 20 Pa. S. \u00a7 711(12)). See Wilson v. Board of Directors, supra at 550-51, 188 A. at 591-92; Hamilton v. John O. Mercer Home, 228 Pa. 410, 422, 77 A. 630, 634 (1910) (per curiam); Laverelle Estate, supra, at 451-52; Baer\u2019s Estate, 55 Lancaster L. Rev. 111 (Pa. O.C. 1956).\nThere is simply no nexus between settlor\u2019s whimsical notion and the competency of trustees to perform their trust duties, always, it must be remembered, under the supervision of the court. In short, the religion of trustees\u2019s spouses is as irrelevant to the trustees\u2019s ability to serve as is the color of their spouses\u2019s eyes.\nThis Court has not infrequently stated that a settlor may \u201ccondition his bounty as suits himself, so long as he violates no law in so doing.\u201d Morgan\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 223 Pa. 228, 230, 72 A. 498, 499 (1909) ; see Henry Estate, 413 Pa. 478, 483-84, 198 A.2d 585, 587 (1964); Kelsey Estate, 393 Pa. 513, 518, 143 A.2d 42, 45 (1958); Borsch Estate, 362 Pa. 581, 587, 67 A.2d 119, 122 (1949). We have also consistently adhered to the principle that a person\u2019s prejudices are part of his liberty, and that these prejudices, if their enforcement does not offend the Constitution or public policy, can be made part of a settlor\u2019s scheme of distribution. Johnson Estate, 435 Pa. 303, 312, 255 A.2d 571, 575 (1969); Somerville Will, 406 Pa. 207, 216-17, 177 A.2d 496, 500-01 (1962); Higbee Will, 365 Pa. 381, 384, 75 A.2d 599, 601 (1950); McCown v. Fraser, 327 Pa. 561, 192 A. 674 (1937); Cauffman v. Long, 82 Pa. 72 (1876). However, settlor\u2019s partiality for the religious persuasion of the trustees\u2019s spouses is unrelated to his dispositive scheme. His desire was to benefit charity generally. He placed no restriction, save the trustees\u2019s absolute discretion, on the charities which could receive contributions from the Foundation. Neither injustice nor detriment to settlor\u2019s desire to benefit charities is occasioned by refusing to enforce the preference that the trustees\u2019s spouses be Protestant.\nMoreover, this Court has never held that every notion of a settlor is entitled to judicial vindication. See James Estate, supra. Here, the declaration that trustees\u2019s spouses be Protestant appears as a whim, unrelated to settlor\u2019s charitable intentions, his scheme of distribution, or the administration of the trust. It is plainly insignificant in view of the Commonwealth\u2019s parens patriae power and the court\u2019s visitorial and supervisory responsibility. Adjudicating irrelevant notions, like settlor\u2019s preference for the religious persuasion of trustees\u2019s spouses, only results in the unproductive burdening of judicial resources and creates the risk that the quality of justice may be debased. Settlor\u2019s partiality is an irrelevant and unreasonable condition and not appropriate for judicial enforcement.\nSettlor\u2019s trust instrument directed that the trustees select successor trustees. A majority of the board appointed Anne Coleman Mamana trustee. The orphans\u2019 court should not have disturbed the board\u2019s decision by insisting upon compliance with what is realistically a condition of no substance or significance to the administration of the trust. It was error to reject Anne Coleman Mamana\u2019s appointment because of her husband\u2019s religion. As for Horace C. Coleman, Jr., he may of course resign as trustee, if he so desires. However, his resignation based solely on his belief that it was compelled by his wife\u2019s religious persuasion should not have been enforced by the orphans\u2019 court. It was error to do so.\nConsiderations of settlor\u2019s partiality for the religious belief of trustees\u2019s spouses are not appropriate bases for determining eligibility of a trustee, and do not justify the court\u2019s determination. Settlor with the greatest clarity expressed his definite and exclusive intention to benefit the general public by his charitable contributions. That, and not the religious persuasion of the trustees\u2019s spouses, was the mission of his trust.\nDecree reversed. Costs on the Foundation.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones concurs in the result.\nMr. Justice Eagen dissents.\nAppellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(3), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(3) (Supp. 1973).\nSettlor named as corporate trustee The Pennsylvania Company for Insurances on Lives and Granting Annuities, whose successor in interest, The First Pennsylvania Banking & Trust Company, now serves as trustee.\nSettlor expressly granted the Foundation\u2019s trustees, both individual and corporate, the right to appoint successor trustees. All actions of the trustees, including the selection of successor trustees, were required to be by majority vote. The appointment of Anne Coleman Mamana was fully in accordance with settlor\u2019s trust provisions. Horace C. Coleman, Jr., John M. Coleman, and the First Pennsylvania Banking & Trust Company voted in favor of the appointment of Anne Coleman Mamana; Eleanor Klemm dissented.\nPruner Estate, 390 Pa. 529, 136 A.2d 107 (1957) ; Pa.
