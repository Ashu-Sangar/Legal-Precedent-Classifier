{"id": "1271003", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Arnold,\nIn this action of trespass for injuries sustained by minor plaintiff when struck by defendant\u2019s automobile, the jury awarded a verdict for plaintiffs and the court below granted a new trial on defendant\u2019s motion therefor. Plaintiffs appeal.\nThe court gave as its reasons for new trial that \u201ca grave injustice would be done to the defendant\u201d, and that \u201cthe conflicting, inconclusive, confusing and in some respects incredible testimony presented in the plaintiff\u2019s behalf, requires us, in order to effect justice, to grant a new trial.\u201d (Italics supplied).\nAn order awarding new trial will not be reversed unless a palpable abuse of discretion by the trial judge is disclosed, or unless an erroneous rule of law controlling the outcome is certified by him as the sole reason for his action: Foster v. Waybright, 367 Pa. 615, 80 A. 2d 801. \u201c 'One of the least assailable grounds for the exercise of such power [to grant a new trial] is the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that the interests of justice therefore require that a new trial be awarded; especially in such a case is an appellate court reluctant to interfere.\u2019 \u201d: Bellettiere v. Philadelphia, 367 Pa. 638, 643, 81 A. 2d 857.\nIn the latter case Justice, now Chief Justice, Stern further declared at page 644: \u201cIn the present case the learned trial court did not, in so many words, express the opinion that the verdict of the jury was against the weight of the evidence; such a conclusion, however, is clearly inferable from its observations concerning the testimony and its statement that 'in the interests of justice a new trial should be granted.\u2019 . . . While we would strongly impress upon trial courts the obvious desirability of stating in detail the exact reasons for which alone a new trial is granted instead of relying upon the mere generality that the 'interests of justice\u2019 require it, we are, in the present case, of opinion that the court acted well within its discretion in awarding a new trial ... in order that the issue involved may be finally determined with greater assurance of a just result.\u201d\nWhere proof depends upon oral testimony it is nevertheless the province of the jury to decide, under proper instructions from the court, as to the law applicable to the facts. But this is subject to the salutary power of the court to award a new trial if it determines the verdict to be contrary to the weight of the evidence.\nIn the instant case, there was direct conflict between the proof submitted by plaintiffs and that of defendant. If the matter rested there, we would be constrained to reverse. However, the conflict also existed in the testimony of plaintiffs\u2019 own witnesses. Benefiting from his presence at trial, and seeing and hearing the witnesses as they testified, the court concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 testimony was not only conflicting and inconclusive, but in some instances was incredible. We find no abuse of discretion in the grant of a new trial on those grounds.\nIt is not questioned that minor plaintiff was struck by defendant\u2019s automobile and suffered permanent injuries. But serious doubt as to defendant\u2019s negligence is created by plaintiffs\u2019 testimony alone. Minor plaintiff\u2019s sister, 9 years of age at the time of the accident, testified that she had run across the street after a dog; that when in the center of the street she looked to the left and saw defendant\u2019s automobile 20 to 25 feet away; that the defendant swerved \u201cto keep from hitting\u201d her, and in doing so it struck minor plaintiff\u2019s head, he being on the curb with his head \u201cbent over.\u201d A disinterested witness for plaintiffs testified that the sister had \u201cpractically\u201d reached the opposite curb when defendant approached at a speed of 35 miles per hour; that defendant swerved without reason, struck the minor plaintiff and entered upon the sidewalk about 5 feet before stopping; that the automobile remained on the walk for approximately one-half hour; and that the Uniontown firemen\u2019s ambulance took minor plaintiff\nto the hospital. The mother of minor plaintiff testified she did not see the accident but came along immediately afterwards; that minor plaintiff was lying in the street, 2 or 3 feet from the curb; that she placed the minor plaintiff in defendant\u2019s automobile then in the street, and that defendant immediately drove them to the hospital. Not only do defendant\u2019s witnesses contradict vital testimony of plaintiffs as to negligence, but it is apparent from the foregoing, and from the reading of all of the testimony, that plaintiffs\u2019 proof was \u201cconfusing and in some respects incredible.\u201d Under such circumstances, the court below cannot be charged with a palpable abuse of discretion.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents."}
