{"id": "874079", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Sterrett,\nThis appeal is from the decree that has been considered and affirmed in an opinion just filed in Emerick\u2019s Estate, supra, 191, No. 2, of January term, 1895.\nWe find nothing in the record that would justify us in sustaining any of appellant\u2019s assignments of error; nor do we think that either of them requires discussion. The rejected claims were not liens on the land when the same was sold. The claims of David Dunkle and John A. Swartz, referred to in the fourth specification, were based on notes of the intestate which were barred by the statute of limitations. The Dunkle note is dated March 81, 1882, and the Swartz note May 12,1880, both payable one day after date. Nothing appears to have been done whereby the lien of either was extended beyond the period of five years from the decease of the maker. Neither of the specifications is sustained.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellant."}
