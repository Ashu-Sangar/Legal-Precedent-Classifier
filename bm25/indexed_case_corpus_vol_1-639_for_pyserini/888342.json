{"id": "888342", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal is from the definitive decree of the orphans\u2019 court dismissing exceptions and confirming the adjudication of the learned auditing judge.\nWe find nothing in the record that requires discussion. A careful consideration of the questions involved has satisfied us as to the correctness of the auditing judge\u2019s conclusions, and we therefore affirm the decree on his adjudication and dismiss the appeal at appellant\u2019s costs."}
