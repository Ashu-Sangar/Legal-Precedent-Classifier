{"id": "888279", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nA careful consideration of this record has led us to the conclusion that the court below was clearly right in dismissing the exceptions and confirming the master\u2019s report. His findings of fact \u2014 so far at least as they are material to any of the questions involved in the specifications of error \u2014 were fully warranted by the evidence. On the facts thus established by the learned master\u2019s findings and approval of the court, the decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed at plaintiff\u2019s costs."}
