{"id": "575302", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Roberts,\nThese three appeals were argued together during the September 1972, Term, and will be disposed of in this opinion.\nOn September 7, 1968, a justice of the peace found appellant Peter T. Campana not guilty of disorderly conduct, a charge arising out of an August 17, 1968, incident. Additional charges arising from the same incident of resisting arrest and assault on a police officer were dismissed for lack of sufficient evidence. Subsequently the Commonwealth again instituted the charges of resisting arrest and assault on a police officer before another justice of the peace who bound appellant over to the grand jury. On February 5, 1969, appellant was tried by jury and convicted of both crimes. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was placed on probation for a period of one year. The Superior Court affirmed in a per curiam order, with Judge Hoeeman noting a dissent. Commonwealth v. Campana, 217 Pa. Superior Ct. 818, 270 A. 2d 231 (1970). We granted allocatur and heard argument during the January 1972, Term. Subsequently we ordered reargument during the September 1972, Term.\nAppellants John Doe, et al., were convicted by a justice of the peace on June 10, 1968, of disorderly conduct and disturbing the peace for their conduct in a Berks County bar on May 19, 1968. Each appellant was ordered to either pay a fine of $300.00 or undergo imprisonment for thirty days. The justice of the peace also bound appellants over to the grand jury on charges of aggravated assault and battery, riot, riotous destruction of property and malicious mischief, all charges originating from the May 19,1968, disturbance. On June 10, 1969, appellants were tried by jury and convicted of riot, riotous destruction of property and malicious mischief. In addition appellants John Hall and Charles Ginder were found guilty of assault and battery. Motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were argued. The motion in arrest of judgment was granted only as to the malicious mischief charge. Each appellant was sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of not less than one and one-half nor more than five years. The Superior Court affirmed per curiam with Judge Hoffman filing a dissenting opinion in which Judge Spaulding joined. Commonwealth v. John Doe, 217 Pa. Superior Ct. 148, 269 A. 2d 138 (1970). We granted allocatur and, after first hearing argument dining the January 1972, Term, ordered re-argument during the September 1972, Term.\nOn February 28, 1969, appellant Bobert Earl King was ordered to pay a fine of $500.00 by a justice of the peace for disorderly conduct that occurred the same day. The justice of the peace also bound appellant over to the grand jury on charges of assault and battery on a police officer in execution of a legal process and resisting arrest, both charges stemming from the February 28, 1969, incident. On September 11, 1969, appellant in a nonjury trial was convicted of both charges, and a sentence of not less than six months nor more than one year was imposed. No post-trial motions were filed but on March 8, 1971, appellant was allowed to file post-trial motions as if timely filed. After their denial the Superior Court affirmed with a per curiam order. Commonwealth v. King, 220 Pa. Superior Ct. 771, 286 A. 2d 416 (1972). We granted allocatur and ordered the appeal heard at the time of reargument of the above cases.\nPresented for consideration in these consolidated appeals is whether appellants, by virtue of their second prosecutions, were subjected to \u201cDouble Jeopardy\u201d in contravention of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. We hold that all charges resulting from the criminal \u201cepisode\u201d of each appellant should have been consolidated at one trial, and consequently the second prosecutions violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Accordingly we reverse the judgments of sentences imposed as a result of the second prosecutions.\nThe Double Jeopardy Clause reads in deceptively simple terms: \u201c[N]or shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; . . .\u201d Although the language of the clause remains cryptic, leading authorities generally turn to Justice Black\u2019s opinion in Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187, 78 S. Ct. 221, 223 (1957), as an impassioned yet reasoned statement of the policies underlying the Double Jeopardy Clause: \u201c[T]he State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nWhile courts and commentators remain undecided whether the clause governs the question of how many separate criminal offenses a defendant can be punished for at a single trial, authorities are unanimous that the principal purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is to prevent \u201crepeated attempts to convict an individual of an alleged offense\u201d through a series of prosecuticois. As Mr. Chief Justice Burger has noted: \u201c \u2018The prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy . . . .\u2019 The \u2018twice put in jeopardy\u2019 language of the Constitution thus relates to a potential, i.e., the risk that an accused for a second time will be convicted of the \u2018same offense\u2019 for which he was initially tried.\u201d Price v. Georgia, 398 U.S. 323, 326, 90 S. Ct. 1757, 1759 (1970).\nAt its inception in early common law the defense of double jeopardy was remarkably equipped to prevent successive prosecutions. Criminal statutes were relatively few in number and broad in coverage. An acquittal at one trial could not generally be followed by another prosecution, because the second trial would by necessity be based on precisely the same charge as that of the first. A conviction resulted in a severe sentence, generally death, leaving little incentive for the prosecution to seek another trial.\nAs countless legal scholars have noted, however, the modern age of criminal procedure has witnessed a proliferation of penal statutes. A consequence of this development is the judiciary\u2019s responsibility \u201cto recognize that new rules must be devised to cope with the fact that a single factual situation, may today give rise to a number of substantive offenses.\u201d Prosecutors, \u201cby consulting a Thesaurus,\u201d are presently able to dissect a single criminal \u201cact\u201d, \u201ctransaction\u201d, \u201coccurrence\u201d, \u201cepisode\u201d or \u201ccircumstance\u201d, and produce a variety of criminal charges. Unless the judiciary properly meets its responsibility, a prosecutor, if he is for any reason dissatisfied with Hie result of the first trial, could circumvent the generally accepted prohibition against state appeals with a new set of charges for a second prosecution. Such \u201ctrial run\u201d prosecutions are, in Mr. Justice Stewart's words, \u201cprecisely what the constitutional guarantee forbids.\u201d\nThe Pennsylvania Double Jeopardy Clause, differing only stylistically from that contained in the Fifth Amendment, has been thought to be limited only to what were heretofore \u201ccapital\u201d offenses. Nevertheless, defendants in this Commonwealth have been afforded a measure of protection against successive prosecutions by common law pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. These pleas prevent a prosecutor, after a conviction or acquittal of a \u201cconstituent\u201d or lesser included offense in the first trial, for initiating a second prosecution for a greater offense.\nSimilarly we have construed our Double Jeopardy Clause to protect a defendant upon retrial in a murder prosecution from conviction in the second trial of a greater offense than that of the first, or greater punisment. In Dinkey v. Commonwealth, 17 Pa. 126 (1851), this Court applied collateral estoppel to prevent a second prosecution where an issue necessary to sustain the charge was resolved in defendant\u2019s favor at the first trial. In Commonwealth v. Lloyd, 141 Pa. 28, 30, 21 Atl. 411 (1891), we unanimously prohibited a second prosecution because the state could have joined both counts at the first trial: \u201c[W]e do not think the commonwealth can prosecute for the one offence in one county, and for the other in a different county. In other words, there may be two counts, but not two prosecutions. The commonwealth has elected in this instance to proceed in Luzerne county, and we think is bound by such election. . . (Emphasis supplied.)\nMany jurisdictions, including perhaps this one at times, have applied a \u201csame evidence\u201d test to determine whether a second prosecution is for the \u201csame offense.\u201d That test has been almost unanimously regarded as totally ineffective to implement the important double jeopardy guarantee of preventing successive prosecutions. As one commentator in the Yale Law Journal aptly noted: \u201cAttempting to choose which version of the same evidence test would best implement the double jeopardy prohibition is like deciding which of five lumber jacks would be the most handy with a violin.\u201d\nThe United States Supreme Court has recently responded to the problem posed by successive prosecutions in two landmark cases. In Waller v. Florida, 397 U.S. 387, 90 S. Ct. 1184 (1970), the Court held impermissible as a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause a second prosecution that was concededly for the \u201csame acts\u201d that the defendant had been punished for in a court of limited jurisdiction. More significantly, Mr.\nJustice Stewart, speaking for the .Court in Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436, 90 S. Ct. 1189 (1970), gave specific recognition to the \u201cpossibility] [of] prosecutors . . . spin[ning] out a startingly [sic] numerous series of offenses from a single alleged criminal transaction.\u201d As a partial response to that \u201cstartling\u201d possibility, the Court held a second prosecution impermissible where an application of \u201ccollateral estoppel\u201d revealed that an \u201cultimate fact\u201d essential to the offense in the second trial had been decided in defendant\u2019s favor at the first.\nThe protection afforded a defendant against successive or repeated prosecutions by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, however, is diminished considerably by its inherent limitations. That imprecise doctrine has proven quite difficult and burdensome for appellate courts to properly and uniformly apply. Before the doctrine of collateral estoppel can apply the first trial must end in acquittal, and a \u201crational\u201d reading of the record must disclose that the jury based its verdict of acquittal on but one issue. As Mr. Justice Schaefer of the Illinois Supreme Court has succinctly observed: \u201cCollateral estoppel is therefore of limited value because it is not often possible to determine with precision how the judge or jury has decided any particular issue.\u201d\nIt has been noted that the doctrine of collateral estoppel places defense connsel on the horns of a dilemma. If defendant is to gain any chance of protection under the doctrine he is better off by limiting his defense at the first trial thus placing fewer facts at issue before the jury. Such a consideration might impair counsel\u2019s ability to effectively represent a defendant.\nBy far the most efficient and enthusiastically received proposal for preventing successive prosecutions is that advanced by the American Law Institute Model Penal Code (\u00a71.07(2)) : \u201c[A] defendant shall not be subject to separate trials for multiple offenses based on the same conduct or arising from the same criminal episode, if such offenses are Imown to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of the first trial. . . ,\u201d The commentary to \u00a71.08 of the Model Penal Code, which bars a second prosecution \u201cbased upon the same facts\u201d as that of the first, states that the purpose of the section is to protect defendants from: \u201csuccessive prosecutions based upon essentially the same conduct, whether the purpose in so doing is to hedge against the risk of an unsympathetic jury at the first trial, to place a \u2018hold\u2019 upon a person after he has been sentenced to imprisonment, or simply to harass by multiplicity of trials.\u201d\nThe ABA Project on Minimum Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance \u00a71.3 (Approved Draft, 1968), with specific reference to the Model Penal Code, accords a defendant the right to request joinder of all charges if they are \u201cbased on the same conduct or arise from the same criminal episode.\u201d \u201cEpisode\u201d is defined as \u201c \u2018an occurrence or connected series of occurrences and developments which may be viewed as distinctive and apart although part of a larger or more comprehensive series.\u2019 \u201d ABA Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance \u00a71.3(a) (commentary). As the commentary to the ABA Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance \u00a71.3(a) states: \u201cIt is the view of the Advisory Committee that, except where the ends of justice would otherwise be defeated, the defendant should not be subjected to multiple trials of related offenses. ...\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nIn recent months the Oregon Supreme Court, after careful analysis of the inadequacy of existing proteetions against successive prosecutions, held that \u201ca second prosecution is for the \u2018same offense\u2019 and is prohibited if (1) the charges arise out of the same act or transaction. . . .\u201d State v. Brown, 497 P. 2d 1191, 1198 (Ore. S. Ct. 1972). That court observed that the House of Lords in England, the birthplace of the concept of double jeopardy, had recently promulgated a rule of court \u201cthat the prosecution must as a general rule join in the same indictment charges that \u2018are founded on the same facts, or form or are part of a series of offenses of the same or similar character....\u2019 \u201d\nThe Oregon Supreme Court in State v. Brown, supra, further noted that New Jersey and Hawaii among several states have either adopted a \u201csame transaction\u201d test or have long applied one. In California, Illinois, New York and Minnesota compulsory joinder of all offenses arising from a criminal transaction is accomplished by legislative enactment. Compare Pa. R. Crim. P. 219(b) which provides: \u201cTwo or more offenses . . . may be charged in the same indictment if they are . . . based on the same act or transaction.\u201d\nWhile the Supreme Court iu Ashe v. Swenson, supra, had only to decide whether collateral estoppel was within the aegis of the Double Jeopardy Clause, three concurring Justices indicated that the clause requires \u201cthe prosecution ... to join at one trial all charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction\u201d. 397 U.S. at 453-54, 90 S. Ct. at 1199 (footnote omitted). Mr. Justice Brennan, writing for himself and Mr. Justices Douglas and Marshall, further stated: \u201cThis \u2018same transaction\u2019 test of \u2018same offence\u2019 not only enforces the ancient prohibition against vexatious multiple prosecutions embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause, but responds as well to the increasingly widespread recognition that the consolidation in one lawsuit of all issues arising out of a single transaction or occurrence best promotes justice, economy, and convenience\u201d\nThe \u201csame transaction\u201d test is not, in Mr. Justice Brennan's words, \u201cself-defining,\u201d but experience in civil law has proved that the concept is both workable and fulfills important societal objectives. By requiring that all causes of action arising from a set of operative facts be consolidated at one proceeding, the concept avoids repetitious litigation and assures finality without unduly burdening the judicial process.\nProponents of the \u201csame transaction\u201d test in criminal law have noted that both interests sought to be preserved by the Double Jeopardy Clause <md important societal interests will equally and effectively be served. By requiring compulsory joinder of all charges arising from a single \u201ctransaction,\u201d a defendant need only once \u201crun the gauntlet\u201d and confront the \u201cawesome resources of the state.\u201d After the jury\u2019s verdict he may have the security and peace of mind that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to protect. As the New Jersey Supreme Court noted almost a century and a half ago: \u201cIf in civil cases, the law abhors a multiplicity of suits, it is yet more watchful in criminal cases, that the crown shall not oppress the subject, or the government the citizen, by unnecessary prosecutions. . . . [This] is a case where the state has thought proper to prosecute the offence in its mildest form, and it is better that the residue of the offence go unpunished, than by sustaining a second indictment to sanction a practice which might be rendered an instrument of oppression to the citizen.\u201d State v. Cooper, 13 N.J.L. 361, 375-76 (1833).\nEqually as important, the \u201csame transaction\u201d test protects vital societal interests. Compulsory joinder of all offenses arising from a single \u201ctransaction\u201d avoids piecemeal litigation and thus conserves precious judicial and professional manpower as well as the time of jurors, witnesses, and the use of public resources. All outstanding charges against an accused are swiftly brought at one proceeding, and, if proven guilty, the punishment of a defendant is commensurate with all crimes actually committed. The \u201csame transaction\u201d test prevents the \u201ctrial run\u201d and inadequately prepared prosecutions that the Court in Aslie found offensive to the double jeopardy provision. 397 U.S. at 447, 90 S. Ct. at 1196.\nAs the Oregon Supreme Court so appropriately noted in People v. Brown, 497 P. 2d at 1195: \u201cThe [United States Supreme Court] has not made its position clear in multiple prosecution cases.\u201d In Ashe, the Court established that as a constitutional minimum the Double Jeopardy Clause incorporated the doctrine of collateral estoppel, but did not reach the issue we confront today.\nAlthough we are thus left without specific guidance from the Supreme Court on this particular issue, it nevertheless remains this Court\u2019s responsibility to decide an issue which, as here, is not governed by the previously announced constitutional minimum standard. We hold, in light of the persuasive authority discussed above, that the Double Jeopardy Clause requires a prosecutor to bring, in a single proceeding, all known charges against a defendant arising from a \u201csingle criminal episode.\u201d\nIt should be noted that in Pennsylvania, it is clear that both summary offenses and indictable offenses may be considered at a single common pleas proceeding: \u201cIn those cases where the evidence presented to the jury on the indictable charge applies equally and is dispositive of the summary offense, it is not necessary that a separate hearing on the summary offense be held.\u201d Commonwealth v. Dawkins, 216 Pa. Superior Ct. 198, 201 n.3, 264 A. 2d 722, 723 n.3 (1970). See also Commonwealth v. Ray, 448 Pa. 307, 292 A. 2d 410 (1972) (summary offense and indictable offense consolidated at one proceeding); Commonwealth v. Rose, 214 Pa. Superior Ct. 50, 251 A. 2d 815 (1969), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 437 Pa. 30, 261 A. 2d 586 (1970); Commonwealth ex rel. Levine v. Fair, 186 Pa. Superior Ct. 299, 144 A. 2d 395 (1958), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 394 Pa. 262, 146 A. 2d 834 (1958); see March v. Commonwealth, 10 Sadler 479, 14 Atl. 375 (1888).\nAs this Court recognized in Commonwealth v. Ray, supra at 309 n.3, 292 A. 2d at 412 n.3: \u201cWhere an individual is charged with a summary and an indictable offense arising out of the same facts and is held for court on the latter charge, we are informed a magistrate in Philadelphia as a matter of practice returns all charges for disposition at trial.\u201d\nAlthough Dawhins, supra, and Ray, supra, are cases from the City of Philadelphia, it is clear beyond cavil that the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court is precisely the same as that of all other common pleas courts.\nTurning our focus to the records in each appeal, it is clear that all charges brought in the two successive prosecutions against each appellant originated from but one criminal episode.\nThe evidence adduced at the first and second prosecutions involving appellant Campana established that on August 17, 1968, a disturbance was reported to the police. Upon their arrival two policemen noticed appellant \u201ctussling\u201d with his friends. When appellant was asked for his identification, he pushed the officer and rammed an automobile door into the officer\u2019s stomach. During the ensuing struggle to arrest appellant the other officer was also struck. All parties concede that the events were part of a single transaction. Thus appellant, who was initially acquitted of disorderly conduct, should not have had to \u201crun the gantlet\u201d for a second time on charges arising from the same criminal episode.\nAppellants John Doe, et ah, on May 19, 1968, entered a Berks County bar and initiated a \u201cbrawl.\u201d The event lasted, according to eyewitnesses, \u201ca couple of minutes,\u201d \u201ctwo or three minutes.\u201d After the incident appellants immediately fled. The Commonwealth argues, notwithstanding this testimony, that there were actually two episodes. Belying on the testimony of one witness concerning minimal property damage outside the bar, the Commonwealth contends that there was one episode in the bar and one outside. We reject that metaphysical division, because the record discloses that any damage outside the bar was done during appellants\u2019 quick flight from the brawl. Because the record establishes but a single criminal episode it is clear that all charges brought against appellants should have been consolidated in a single proceeding.\nAppellant King on February 28, 1969, placed a phone call to the police to seek assistance. When two policemen arrived and appeared reluctant to arrest certain individuals appellant claimed were interfering with his automobile, appellant began to use abusive language directed at the police. After giving appellant several warnings, the police informed appellant that he was under arrest. During the attempt to effectuate the arrest, appellant struck one of the officers. The record disclosing only a single criminal episode, all charges brought against appellant should have been consolidated at a single proceeding.\nThe judgments of sentences imposed at No. 151. September Term, 1968, Lycoming County, No. 255 September Sessions, 1968, Berks County, and No. 520 April Sessions, 1969, Allegheny County, are reversed. The judgment of sentence at No. 325 October Sessions, 1968 Allegheny County is affirmed.\nAppellants John Doe and Gerald Ereese were fugitives at the time of the second criminal prosecution and were not tried. Although their names appear in the caption on the briefs, we do not pass upon the merits of their contentions.\nIn Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 794, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 2062 (1969), the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment . . . app[li.es\u2019] to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d Benton is retroactive and thus applicable to all these appeals. See Price v. Georgia, 398 U.S. 323, 330 n.9, 90 S. Ct. 1757, 1762 n.9 (1970) ; Commonwealth v. Richbourg, 442 Pa. 147, 153, 275 A. 2d 345, 348 (1971).\nAppellants John Doe, et ah, had their two trials before the Supreme Court decided Benton. Therefore the fact that appellants did not raise the issue of double jeopardy until their appeal to the Superior Court does not bar them from relief. See Commonwealth v. Stevens, 429 Pa. 593, 599-600, 240 A. 2d 536, 540 (1968) ; see also Commonwealth v. Cheeks, 429 Pa. 89, 239 A. 2d 793 (1968).\nAppellant King, although tried after the decision in Benton, did not raise the issue of double jeopardy either at trial or during post-trial motions. The record discloses, however, that appellant in his pro se Post Conviction Hearing Act petition raised the issue of double jeopardy. As a result of that petition, counsel was appointed and appellant was allowed to file post-trial motions as if timely filed. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that appellant has forfeited his right to litigate this issue. See Commonwealth v. Cheeks, supra, cf. Commonwealth v. McGrogan, 449 Pa. 584, 297 A. 2d 456 (1972). See also Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396 (1967) ; Commonwealth v. Baker, 429 Pa. 209, 239 A. 2d 201 (1968).\nSee text following note 32, infra.\nIn light of our disposition we do not reach appellant Campana\u2019s contention that before he could be convicted of resisting arrest the Commonwealth must establish that the arrest was \u201clawful.\u201d\nLikewise we do not reach appellants John Doe, et al.\u2019s contentions that (1) there was insufficient evidence to prove that appellant John E. Hall participated in the alleged riot or assault and battery; (2) the representation of all appellants by the same counsel created a conflict of interest; (3) the trial court did not comply with Pa. R. Crim. P. 1106 in the jury selection.\nAppellant King has also appealed his judgment of sentence at No. 325, October Sessions, 1968, imposed for aggravated assault and battery, a charge arising from an entirely separate occurrence. We find sufficient evidence to support the conviction and affirm.\nOur discussion today deals only with the issue of successive prosecutions. We do not intimate a view on whether, at one trial, appellants could have been convicted of both the summary offenses and the indictable offenses. As a commentator in the Stanford Law .Review has observed: \u201cBecause of the different policies underlying the two protections, the question of permitting double prosecution should be considered independently from the issue of punishment.\u201d Note, The Protection Against Multiple Trials, 11 Stan.

Baker, 413 Pa. 105, 109-112, 196 A. 2d 382, 384-86 (1964), and eases discussed therein.\nPennsylvania is apparently the only state where the double jeopardy clause has been previously limited to capital offenses.

L.R. 357 (1970).\nin numerous situations our Pennsylvania Rules of Court require joinder of related claims. See, e.g., Pa. R. Crim. P. 103(b) (\u201cWhen more than one offense is alleged to have been committed by one person arising from the same incident, the issuing authority shall accept only one complaint, and shall docket the matter as a single case.\u201d) ; Pa. R. Crim. P. 304(e) (\u201cAll grounds for the [pretrial] relief demanded shall be stated in the application and failure to state a ground shall constitute a waiver thereof.\u201d).\nRule 1020(d) (1) of the Civil Procedure Rules similarly requires the joinder of all causes of action: \u201cIf a transaction or occurrence . . . gives rise to causes of action in assumpsit and trespass against the same person . . . they shall be joined in an action against any such person in separate counts. . .\nRule 1020(d) (4) further provides: \u201cFailure to join a cause of action as required by subdivision (d) (1) of this Rule shall be deemed a waiver of that cause of action as against all parties to the action.\u201d\n397 U.S. at 454, 90 S. Ct. at 1199 (footnote omitted) (emphasis supplied). The \u201csame transaction\u201d test is subject to common sense exceptions. The Model Penal Code notes that all offenses must be \u201cknown to the appropriate prosecuting officer at the time of the commencement of the first trial.\u201d \u00a71.07(2). See Commonwealth ex rel. Papy v. Maroney, 417 Pa. 368, 207 A. 2d 814 (1965). Both the ABA Standards Relating to Joinder and Severance \u00a72.2 and the A.L.I. Model Penal Code \u00a71.07(3) recommend severance if either party can demonstrate prejudice. See also 397 U.S. at 455 n.ll, 90 S. Ct. at 1200 n.ll (Brennan, J., concurring).\nSimilarly, the \u201csame transaction\u201d test is not applicable where no single court has jurisdiction over all alleged crimes arising from a single transaction. 397 U.S. at 453 n.7, 90 S. Ct. at 1199 n.7 (Brennan, ,T., concurring).\n\u201cAlthough analogies to the use of the phrase [same transaction] in civil litigation are not perfect since policy considerations differ, some further guidance for its application . . . can be obtained from the course of its application in civil litigation, where the courts have not encountered great difficulty in reaching sound results in particular cases. See 3 J. Moore, Federal Practice \u00b613.13 (1968) ; 1A W. Barron and A. Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7394 (Wright ed. I960).\u201d 397 U.S. at 454 n.8, 90 S.

Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966) beyond that required by the United States Supreme Court, but \u201cchose not to do so.\u201d\nSee text following note 32, supra, ef.

L. , No. 334, \u00a71, 18 C.P.S.A. |110 (1973) (effective .Tune 6, 1973).\nThe Philadelphia Common Pleas Court is given \u201cunlimited original jurisdiction.\u201d Pennsylvania Constitution, art. V, Schedule to Judiciary Article, Section 16(o). Similarly, art. V, \u00a75(b) of the Pennsylvania Constitution gives all common pleas courts \u201cunlimited original jurisdiction.\u201d Municipal courts in Philadelphia are given jurisdiction over \u201cAll summary offenses.\u201d Art. V, Schedule to Judiciary Article, Section 16(r) (ii). Likewise justices of the peace outside of Philadelphia are given jurisdiction over offenses \u201cpunishable upon summary conviction.\u201d Act of April 26, 1929, P. L. 824, \u00a71, 42 P.S. \u00a7391.\nFinally, it is a familiar canon of construction that \u201c[p] revisions decreasing the jurisdiction of a court of record . . . [are to be] strictly construed.\u201d Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, art. IV, \u00a758, 46 P.S. \u00a7558(7). There being no discernible difference between the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court and all other common pleas courts, there can be no serious doubt that all common pleas courts have concurrent jurisdiction over summary offenses. See also Commonwealth v. Dawkins, 216 Pa. Superior Ct. 198, 264 A. 2d 722 (1970) and the cases cited therein.\nAs noted in footnote 4, supra, we affirm appellant King\u2019s conviction for aggravated assault and battery at No. 325, since this charge arose from an \u201centirely separate occurrence\u201d and sufficient evidence was offered to support the conviction."}
