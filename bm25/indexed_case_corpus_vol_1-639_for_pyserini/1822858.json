{"id": "1822858", "contents": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nThe principal issue presented by this appeal is whether Chapter 21 of the Uniform Commercial Code \u2014 Sales, 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2101-2725, applies generally to transactions involving the lease of goods, and in particular, to the lease of the burglar alarm system which is the subject of this case.\nThe evidence adduced at trial discloses the following. In July, 1973, appellants Anthony and Grace Cucchi leased from appellee, Rollins Protective Services Company (\u201cRollins\u201d), a burglar alarm system for installation in and protection of their family residence. Appellant Anthony Cucchi and a sales representative for Rollins signed a printed form entitled \u201cInstallation-Service Contract\u201d which provided that appellants would pay the sum of $500.00 for installation of the burglar alarm system and a $15.00 monthly fee for service and maintenance of the system. This contract further provided that the \u201cRollins Protective System shall remain personal property and title thereto shall continue in Rollins,\u201d that appellants were to refrain from damaging the system, and that upon termination of the lease, the system would be returned to Rollins. Additionally, the contract contained a $250.00 limitation of liability provision for all loss or damage resulting from failure of the system in operation or performance.\nThe written contract expressly set forth the condition that: \u201cThis contract shall not be binding upon Rollins until accepted at Rollins\u2019 Home Office.\u201d In fact, the contract was never signed or executed by \u201cRollins\u2019 Home Office.\u201d However, appellants paid Rollins to install the burglar alarm system, and Rollins installed said system in appellants\u2019 residence. Since that time in 1973, \u2022 Rollins has maintained and serviced this burglar alarm system on a regular and continuing basis, including the replacement of component parts as needed, and appellants have made regular monthly payments for service and maintenance charges.\nOn February 2, 1984, appellants\u2019 home was burglarized and approximately $36,000.00 worth of personal property was stolen. Mrs. Cucchi recalled activating the burglar alarm system before she left the residence on the day of the burglary. When appellants\u2019 daughter discovered the burglary later that day, the burglar alarm system was activated but was not operating or signalling an alarm. Subsequent testing that night and the following day indicated that the system was operating only intermittently.\nRollins\u2019 representatives did all of the maintenance on the burglar alarm system, and the last service check had been on January 13, 1984. Within three months preceding the burglary, Rollins\u2019 personnel had replaced two transmitters which were integral component parts of the system.\nOn October 30, 1985, appellants filed a civil action in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County seeking damages against Rollins for the loss of their personal property. The complaint sounded in assumpsit for breach of express and implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for intended use (Count I), in trespass for negligence in manufacturing, installing, repairing and servicing the burglar alarm system (Count II), and in trespass on a strict liability theory under section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (Count III).\nRollins denied the allegations of liability, and asserted various defenses to the claims, including that the action was time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations and that any damages were limited to $250.00 by the express limitation of damages provision of the written contract.\nThe trial court, the Honorable Melvin G. Levy presiding, granted Rollins\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to the strict liability/402A count, but denied the motion on the remaining counts. Prior to trial, Rollins moved to admit the written \u201cInstallation-Service Contract\u201d in its entirety as a \u201cjudicial admission\u201d of fact, since the appellants had attached said contract to their complaint and relied upon it in their pleadings. The trial court denied this motion on the grounds that the written contract was not legally binding on the parties because it had never been executed by a representative of Rollins\u2019 home office as expressly required as a condition precedent to the binding effect of the contract. Accordingly, the case proceeded to trial not on the written contract, but upon the contract implied by the actions, oral representations and course of conduct of the parties.\nAt trial, appellant Anthony Cucchi testified as to the representations made by Rollins\u2019 salesman in July, 1973. These representations included that the system was \u201cstate of the art\u201d and \u201calmost unbeatable.\u201d Notes of Testimony, Trial, March 3, 1987 at 118. Additionally, Mr. Cucchi stated that the salesman \u201crepresented that this system would do what I wanted it to do which was to provide the safety, knowing that either if we were home, someone was entering my house and/or while we were out a siren would go off and it would ring in the neighborhood.\u201d Id.\nAt the close of the evidence, Rollins moved for a directed verdict on the express warranty and negligence counts. The trial court directed a verdict for Rollins as to the negligence count only, but found sufficient evidence of an express oral warranty to the effect that the burglar alarm system would provide safety. The jury was therefore instructed on appellants\u2019 breach of warranty claim, both express and implied.\nThe jury returned a verdict in the amount of $20,000.00 for appellant Grace Cucchi and $10,000.00 for appellant Anthony Cucchi. Rollins filed post-trial motions which were denied by the court of common pleas.\nOn appeal to Superior Court, Rollins raised four issues for review: whether the trial court erred in ruling that the Installation-Service Contract was a nullity; whether the court erred in denying its motion for directed verdict based on the insufficiency of the evidence to support the breach of warranty claim; whether the court erred in admitting evidence of subsequent repairs; and whether the trial court erred in denying its motion for directed verdict based upon the statute of frauds and statute of limitations defenses contained in the Uniform Commercial Code, (\u201cUCC\u201d), 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 (requiring contracts for the sale of goods for over $500.00 to be in writing, except as otherwise provided) and 2725 (four year statute of limitations in contracts for sale), respectively. In a unanimous opinion by President Judge Vincent A. Cirillo (joined by Judge Patrick R. Tamilia and Senior Judge John P. Hester), the Superior Court panel addressed each of these issues, and resolved all but one against Rollins. On this one last issue, Superior Court held that the provisions of the UCC regarding express and implied warranties and its statute of limitations were applicable to the transaction involving the lease of the burglar alarm system, and that the Cucchis\u2019 complaint for breach of warranty under the UCC was untimely under section 2725, 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2725, because it was filed more than four years after the system was delivered. The Superior Court thus vacated the judgment of the lower court, and dismissed the breach of warranty action against Rollins.\nAppellants challenged Superior Court\u2019s ruling on the statute of limitations by filing a petition for allowance of appeal in this Court. Rollins filed a conditional cross-petition for allowance of appeal requesting that, in the event this Court grant appellants\u2019 petition, we also grant the conditional cross-petition asserting that Superior Court erred in ruling that the Installation-Service Contract was not binding on the parties, and in resolving the other issues that Rollins had raised in that court against it. This Court granted the Cucchis\u2019 petition for allowance of appeal, but denied Rollins\u2019 cross-petition. This appeal followed.\nWith the exception of the resolution of the issue of the timeliness of appellants\u2019 complaint under section 2725 of the UCC, 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2725, we agree with the excellent opinion of the Superior Court regarding the applicability of the Sales provisions of the UCC to transactions involving the lease of goods. (In the uniform model of the UCC, the Sales division is known as Article 2; in Pennsylvania, the Sales division of the UCC is set forth as Chapter 21, 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2101-2725; hereinafter, we will refer to the Sales division of the UCC as \u201cArticle 2/Chapter 21.\u201d)\nSuperior Court first held that Article 2/Chapter 21 of the UCC does not by its terms apply to contracts for the lease of goods. Cucchi v. Rollins Protective Services, 377 Pa. Super. 9, 25-26, 546 A.2d 1131, 1139 (1988). Although 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2102 provides that, unless \u201cthe context otherwise requires, this division applies to transactions in goods,\u201d the Superior Court correctly noted that the entire tenor of Article 2/Chapter 21, including its warranty provisions, deals with \u201csales,\u201d \u201ccontracts for sale,\u201d \u201csellers\u201d and \u201cbuyers.\u201d Since \u201csale\u201d is defined as \u201cthe passing of title from the seller to the buyer at a price,\u201d 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2106(a), and since the burglar alarm system in this case was only leased to appellants and would be returned to Rollins upon termination of the agreement, Superior Court held that Article 2/Chapter 21 was not strictly applicable to the transaction. 377 Pa.Super. at 25-26, 546 A.2d at 1139. We agree.\nSuperior Court next considered whether the Sales division of the UCC, Article 2/Chapter 21, \u201cshould be judicially extended to cover transactions in the form of a lease.\u201d 377 Pa.Super. at 26-27, 546 A.2d at 1140. As that court observed, this is an issue of first impression in the appellate courts of this Commonwealth, although several trial courts have answered that issue in the affirmative. See decisions of the Courts of Common Pleas cited, id. There is, however, no dearth of case law from other jurisdictions nor of commentary in the legal journals and reviews on this subject. This issue has been handled somewhat inconsistently by the courts and the commentators, and much has been written on the subject. See id. 377 Pa.Super. at 27-30, 546 A.2d at 1140-42; see also Special Project, Article Two Warranties in Commercial Transactions: An Update, 72 Corn.L.Rev. 1161, 1162-68, 1205 (1987); and Annot., What Constitutes A Transaction, A Contract for Sale, Or A Sale Within The Scope Of UCC Article 2, 4 ALR 4th 85 (1981).\nAs Superior Court observed, most, (but not all) courts that have considered the issue have concluded that Article 2 of the UCC (Chapter 21 in Pennsylvania) should be judicially extended to other sorts of transactions in goods, including various forms of leases, under one of several approaches: (1) that Article 2/Chapter 21 is applicable in its entirety to leases of goods because the term \u201ctransaction\u201d in goods is broad enough to encompass leases; (2) that some leases are functionally equivalent to sales, and therefore Article 2/Chapter 21 should apply to such lease agreements by analogy; and, (3) that selected provisions of Article 2/Chap-ter 21 should be applied to lease transactions by analogy because, \u201calthough the differences between leases and sales weigh against the extension of all of the provisions of [Article 2/Chapter 21] to leases,\u201d nevertheless there are sufficient economic and practical similarities between sales and leases of goods to apply at least some of the provisions of Article 2/Chapter 21 to lease transactions. 377 Pa.Super. at 29-30, 546 A.2d at 1140-42.\nSuperior Court rejected the first approach as contrary to the express language of the UCC, and rejected the second approach as amorphous and inconsistent in application. 377 Pa.Super. at 27-29, 546 A.2d at 1140-41. That court then adopted the third approach as the law of this Commonwealth, reasoning as follows:\nMany consumers and businesses are leasing goods rather than buying them. Cintrone v. Hertz Truck Leasing & Rental Service, 45 N.J. 434, 448 & n. 1, 212 A.2d 769, 776 & n. 1 (1965) (further citations omitted). By leasing goods, parties achieve substantially the same result as by buying and selling. The essence of both transactions is that the lessee/buyer seeks to acquire the right to use goods and the lessor/sellor [sic] seeks to sell the right to use the goods.\nBy means of a bailment parties can often reach the same business ends that can be achieved by selling and buying. The goods come to the user for the time being and he benefits by their use and enjoyment without the burdens of becoming and remaining the owner. The owner-lessor benefits by receiving the rent for the temporary use.\nCintrone, supra, 45 N.J. at 447, 212 A.2d at 776 (citations omitted). Considering that a large volume of commercial transactions is being cast in the form of a lease instead of a sale, and that leases reach the same economic result as sales, it would be illogical to apply a different set of rules to leases than to sales where there is no justification for doing so.\nHowever, there are significant differences which make the outright extension of [Article 2/Chapter 21] to leases impracticle. These differences include transfer of title, incidents of ownership, risk of loss, financial considerations, taxes, and bankruptcy proceedings. Faced with these differences and the fact that [Article 2/Chapter 21] was designed to govern sales, we cannot be certain that the impact of [Article 2\u2019s/Chapter 21\u2019s] provisions on leases would not be obscure or undesirable. In other words, we cannot be certain that we would not be justified in applying some provisions of [Article 2/Chapter 21] to sales and not to leases. To gain that certainty, we would have to examine each of [Article 2\u2019s/Chapter 21\u2019s] provisions. Given the impossibility of performing this task within one sweeping opinion, we would be remiss in holding [Article 2/Chapter 21] applicable to leases in its entirety at this time. Accordingly, we will analogize the provisions of [Article 2/Chapter 21] to leases only when the specific provision has been examined and the circumstances of the situation warrant the same treatment for leases which is given to sales. In this case, we must examine [Article 2\u2019s/Chapter 21\u2019s] statute of limitations for breach of warranty actions to determine whether it should be held applicable to leases. Because it would be senseless to apply this limitation provision if [Article 2\u2019s/Chapter 21\u2019s] express and implied warranty provisions are not applicable to leases, we will first examine the applicability of these warranty provisions.\n377 Pa.Super, at 29-30, 546 A.2d at 1141-42.\nWe agree with Superior Court and we will judicially extend by analogy selected provisions of Article 2/Chapter 21 to transactions involving the lease of goods on a case by case basis, considering the nature of the specific transaction (lease), the language, purpose, and intent of the UCC provision under consideration, and the practicality of applying the particular provision(s) at issue to the particular transaction in goods. In a related context, this Court has made it clear that there may be little reason in law or logic to apply different sets of rules to lessors/lessees than to sellers/buyers. Thus, in Francioni v. Gibsonia Truck Corp., 472 Pa. 362, 372 A.2d 736 (1977), this Court held that the reasoning, policies and purposes of section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u201capplies with equal force to both lessors and sellers,\u201d and \u201cthat all suppliers of products engaged in the business of supplying products for use or consumption by the public are subject to strict liability\u201d under section 402A.\nAdditionally, we find that Superior Court\u2019s approach is supported by the National Conference for Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and the American Law Institute which has, in October, 1987, adopted Article 2A of the Uniform Commercial Code, a proposed revision to the UCC entitled \u201cLeases.\u201d The drafters of Article 2A-Leases recognized the inconsistency in the various judicial approaches and among the commentators on the issue of the applicability of Article 2-Sales to lease transactions, and determined that \u201cSuch a statute has become especially appropriate with the exponential expansion of the number and scale of personal property lease transactions ... involving billions of dollars annually.\u201d Forward to Proposed Article 2A-Leas-es, by Geoffrey C. Hazard, Jr., Chairman of the Permanent Editorial Board for the Uniform Commercial Code. The drafters of Article 2A-Leases decided, according to the official comments, that Article 2-Sales was \u201cthe appropriate statutory analogue\u201d for conventional leases of goods since the \u201clease is closer in spirit and form to the sale of goods than to the creation of a security interest.\u201d Thus, many of the provisions of Article 2A-Leases were adopted and modified from Article 2-Sales to apply to conventional or \u201ctrue\u201d lease transactions, with very little change in many instances from the corresponding provisions in Article 2-Sales.\nArticle 2A-Leases recognizes and maintains a distinction between \u201ctrue\u201d conventional leases of personal property/goods and finance leases, i.e., security devices disguised as a lease. (See note 5, supra.) According to the official comments, many of the assumptions underlying Article 2-Sales are equally applicable to transactions involving the conventional lease of goods, namely that parties to both of these types of transactions frequently act without counsel, that the agreement of the parties to these transactions is often oral or evidenced by scant writings, that the obligations between the parties to these transactions are bilateral, and that the applicable law should and does preserve, as fully as possible, the freedom to contract in these transactions. However, the assumptions underlying Article 9-Secured Transactions were deemed to be different, and more analogous when dealing with \u201cleases\u201d of goods that were actually finance devices. The assumptions for finance leases/security devices are that parties to these types of transactions are regularly represented by counsel, that the agreement of the parties in these transactions is frequently reduced to writing, extensive in scope, that the obligations between parties in these transactions are essentially unilateral, and because applicable law limits the freedom of contract in these transactions.\nThis Court finds that the promulgation of Article 2A-Leases offers important support for our decision today to judicially extend Article 2/Chapter 21 in Pennsylvania to conventional lease of goods transactions. We do not, however, believe it is in our prerogative to judicially adopt Article 2A-Leases in toto, since our General Assembly was the first state legislature to enact the UCC in 1953 and has not seen fit as yet to adopt Article 2A-Leases. (California, effective January 1, 1990, and Oklahoma, effective November 1, 1988, have enacted Article 2A-Leases into law.) Nevertheless, we consider it appropriate to look to the relevant provisions of proposed Article 2A-Leases for guidance when we consider whether to judicially extend particular provisions of Article 2/Chapter 21 to transactions involving the conventional lease of goods.\nIn the present case, the Superior Court had little difficulty in determining that the warranty provisions of Article 2/Chapter 21, 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2313-15, should apply to the conventional leasing of goods, and held that \u201cthe express and implied warranty provisions of Article 2, specifically sections 2313 and 2314, apply by analogy to leases.\u201d 377 Pa.Super. at 31-33, 546 A.2d at 1143. We agree.\nAs that court noted, lessees rely upon implied and express representations of lessors as to the quality, merchantability and fitness of goods to the same extent and in the same manner as buyers rely upon similar representations by sellers. 377 Pa.Super. at 31, 546 A.2d at 1142. Superior Court looked to this Court\u2019s decisions in the strict liability area, see, e.g., Francioni v. Gibsonia Truck Corp., supra, which minimize the distinction between sales and leases for purposes of breach of warranty actions alleging personal injuries under section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. 377 Pa.Super. at 32-33, 546 A.2d at 1143. We agree. The Superior Court found \u201cthe sale-lease distinction equally unimportant in the area of [UCC] warranty law; for both leases and sales, there should be only one body of warranty law. This will promote uniformity in commercial transactions whether they be cast in the form of a lease or a sale.\u201d 377 Pa.Super. at 33, 546 A.2d at 1143. We agree. We find Superior Court\u2019s reasoning compelling. Additionally, we find further support for applying the warranty provisions of Article 2/Chapter 21 to transactions involving the lease of goods in proposed Article 2A-Leases, which essentially adopts intact the Sales warranty provisions of Article 2/Chapter 21 to lease transactions, with only relatively minor stylistic adaptations. See Article 2A-Leases, sections 2A-210-213, corresponding to 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2313-15. Accordingly, we hold, as did Superior Court, that the express and implied warranty provisions of Article 2/Chapter 21 apply to transactions involving the lease of goods.\nFinally, the Superior Court held that the statute of limitations for breach of warranty actions under Article 2/Chapter 21, 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2725, applies to lease of goods transactions. 377 Pa.Super. at 36, 546 A.2d at 1144. Again, we agree with the Superior Court. In determining the appropriate statute of limitations for an action for breach of warranty under the UCC for personal injury allegedly caused by defective goods, this Court held: \u201cWe rule today that section 2-725 of the Code [13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2725] applies to all breach of warranty actions brought under the Code and that no exception will be made merely because the claim seeks to recover for personal injury.\u201d Williams v. West Penn Power Co., 502 Pa. 557, 570, 467 A.2d 811 (1983). We see no reason to deviate from this rule laid down in Williams that \u201call breach of warranty actions\u201d brought under the UCC, including breach of warranties in sales-analogous transactions (i.e., conventional leases of goods), are governed by the statute of limitations set forth in section 2725, 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2725.\nWe come, then, to our only point of departure from the Superior Court, namely the application of section 2725 to the facts and circumstances presented herein. Section 2725 provides, in relevant part:\nStatute of limitation in contracts for sale\n(a) General rule. \u2014 An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued. By the original agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it.\n(b) Accrual of cause of action. \u2014 A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party\u2019s lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered. (Emphasis added.)\nSuperior Court noted that section 2725 explicitly ties a breach of warranty in a sales transaction to the date \u201cwhen tender of delivery is made,\u201d except in the one exceptional circumstance where the warranty \u201cexplicitly extends to future performance of the goods,\u201d in which case the cause of action \u201caccrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.\u201d Relying on Patton v. Mack Trucks, Inc., 360 Pa.Super. 1, 519 A.2d 959 (1986), Superior Court interpreted the \u201ctime of discovery\u201d exception to the usual \u201ctender of delivery\u201d rule very narrowly, and rejected the argument that a warranty necessarily \u201cextends to future performance\u201d merely because it contains some promises regarding the manner in which goods will perform after delivery is made. 377 Pa.Super. at 37-38, 546 A.2d at 1145. Patton involved a warranty that all articles and services covered by the purchase order for a truck \u201cmeet or exceed the regulations established and promulgated under the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Law.\u201d Superior Court stated in that case that if\nwe held that the warranty \u201cexplicitly extended\u201d to future performance, we would allow the exception to swallow the rule____ We must also reject the related argument that a warranty necessarily extends to future performance when the aggrieved party cannot possibly discover the breach until after tender of delivery.\u201d\n360 Pa.Super. at 9-11, 519 A.2d at 964-65.\nThe Superior Court in this case considered that the express and implied warranties made in regard to the burglar alarm system did not explicitly relate to the future condition or performance of the system, but pertained only to the condition of the alarm system when it was first installed. 377 Pa.Super. at 37, 546 A.2d at 1145. Accordingly, finding its \u201creasoning and conclusions in Patton equally applicable,\u201d Superior Court held that the four year statute of limitations began to run in 1973 when the burglar alarm system was installed, and delivery was made, and thus the lawsuit filed in October 1985 was untimely. 377 Pa.Super. at 38, 546 A.2d at 1145.\nWe agree that the warranty given in Patton did not explicitly extend to future performance and that, therefore, the breach of warranty in that case occurred when tender of delivery was made, not when the actual breach was or should have been discovered. See also Rufo v. Bastian-Blessing Co., 417 Pa. 107, 207 A.2d 823 (1965). Patton is, however, clearly distinguishable from the instant case.\nSection 2725 of the UCC represents an attempt by the drafters, and by our General Assembly, to accomodate the legitimate needs and expectations of the \u201csellers\u201d and \u201cbuyers\u201d (or vendors/purchasers, lessors/lessees) dealing in goods. See Williams, The Statute of Limitations, Prospective Warranties, and Problems of Interpretation in Article Two of the UCC, (\u201cWilliams\u201d) 52 G.W.L.Rev. 67, 68 (1983). As with all statutes of limitations, the major purpose of a given \u201ccut-off\u201d date for claims is the repose of stale claims. The drafters of section 2725 decided on a four year statute of limitations from the tender of delivery (rather than from the time-of-discovery of the breach) primarily to favor the interests of the seller in being able to \u201cclose the books\u201d on a given transaction. See Williams, supra at 100-01, 76-82. Thus, the potential liability of most sellers would be reasonably certain as of four years from the date the goods were delivered.\nHowever, the UCC drafters also recognized that, frequently the parties bargained for (and buyers expected) promises related to the future performance of the goods, and that such agreements and expectations were legitimate and deserving of protection. Williams, supra at 76-82. Thus, the time-of-discovery \u201cexception\u201d was provided in section 2725(b) for warranties \u201cexplicitly extending] to future performance.\u201d While the term \u201cexplicit\u201d might seem to eliminate the possibility of implied prospective warranties, the better view is that warranties explicitly extending to future performance may be both express and implied by content and circumstances sufficiently specific as to unequivocally refer to future performance. Williams, supra at 81 (and see cases cited therein); Ranker v. Skyline Corp., 342 Pa.Super. 510, 493 A.2d 706, 709 (1985), citing Perry v. Augustine, 37 Pa.D. & C.2d 416 (Mercer C.P.1965).\nConsidering the nature of the transaction involved in this case, and the respective interests of the lessor and lessee, we have no difficulty finding that the express and implied warranties made by Rollins explicitly extended to future performance of the burglar alarm system and that discovery of the breach had to await the time of performance.\nAppellants agreed to pay an installation charge and monthly fees for the service and maintenance of a burglar alarm system. The predominant feature of that system was goods \u2014 the transmitters, receivers, siren and other hardware that was installed and serviced by Rollins. Appellants had nothing to do with the service and repair of this system (other than to notify Rollins when and if they knew it to be malfunctioning). Rollins provided regular and continual service and maintenance of the burglar alarm system, including the replacement of component parts as needed. Two transmitters had been replaced by Rollins within three months prior to the burglary. The burglar alarm system was to remain the property of Rollins and was to be returned to Rollins upon termination of the lease.\nThe evident intention of the parties was that Rollins would supply a fully operational, continuously functioning system of security throughout the duration of the lease, in return for which appellants would pay an installation fee and regular monthly fees. The implied warranty in such a transaction is that the burglar alarm system is merchantable and fit for its ordinary purpose and intended use, namely that an alarm will sound if a burglar enters the home. Lobianco v. Property Protection, Inc., 292 Pa.Super. 346, 437 A.2d 417, 424 (1981). The express warranty found by the trial court and jury in this case was that the burglar alarm system would provide \u201csafety,\u201d which, considering the nature of the goods leased, meant protection from unauthorized intrusion. While these warranties, express and implied, do not in and of themselves \u201cexplicitly extend\u201d to future performance, this explicit extension is manifest from all of the circumstances where these parties quite clearly bargained for a continually operational burglar alarm system for the duration of the lease. Indeed, the very nature of a conventional lease of goods with monthly payments by the lessee and the continuous obligation of the lessor to service and repair, especially where (as here) the goods are to be returned in working order to the lessor at the end of the lease, supports a finding that the future performance of the goods has been warranted, and that the goods will continue to operate and remain fit for their ordinary and intended use.\nRecognizing that in the typical conventional lease of goods transaction, the respective interests of the lessor and the lessee require a somewhat different accomodation than those of the seller and buyer in the typical sale of goods transaction, the drafters of Article 2A-Leases adopted the following proposed statute of limitations:\n\u00a7 2A-506. Statute of Limitations.\n(1) An action for default under a lease contract, including breach of warranty or indemnity, must be commenced within 4 years after the cause of action accrued. By the original lease contract the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year.\n(2) A cause of action for default accrues when the act or omission on which the default or breach of warranty is based is or should have been discovered by the aggrieved party or when the default occurs, whichever is later. A cause of action for indemnity accrues when the act or omission on which the claim for indemnity is based is or should have been discovered by the indemnified party, whichever is later.\nBy eliminating section 2725\u2019s \u201ctender of delivery\u201d as the usual event which begins the running of the four year statute of limitations (\u201cbreach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made____\u201d), the drafters of Article 2A-Leases have made the \u201cexplicitly extends to future performance\u201d or \u201ctime of discovery\u201d exception the norm in the lease of goods transaction. This supports our view that the parties in a conventional lease of goods transaction presumably barter for the future performance of the goods. Certainly that is the case under the circumstances of appellants\u2019 lease from Rollins of a burglar alarm system which Rollins was to and did supply and was to keep fully functional throughout the duration of the lease.\nWe hold, therefore, that the express and implied warranties made by Rollins explicitly extended to the future performance of the burglar alarm system and that discovery of .the breach of warranty, in that case, had to await the time of such performance. Therefore, the cause of action accrued, and the four year statute of limitations began to run, when the breach was discovered on February 2, 1984. Appellants\u2019 complaint alleging breach of warranty under the UCC was timely filed on October 30, 1985.\nOrder of the Superior Court is reversed, and the judgment entered by the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County is reinstated.\nNIX, C.J., filed a concurring opinion joined by FLAHERTY, J.\nZAPPALA, J., filed a dissenting opinion joined by McDermott and cappy, jj.\nCAPPY, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. According to the trial court, appellants paid $500.00 immediately upon entering into the agreement, and over the next twelve to eighteen months paid an additional installation fee of over $500.00. Additionally, appellants paid the monthly service and maintenance fee throughout the duration of the agreement, which began at $15.00 per month and had increased to over $30.00 per month.\n. While the contract stated only that it \"shall not be binding upon Rollins until accepted by Rollins Home Office,\u201d the trial court held that the contract was a nullity and did not bind appellants either because \"obligations under a contract ... must be mutual and not merely unilateral----\u201d Opinion denying post-trial motions, slip op. at 6.\n. Rollins\u2019 post-trial motions asserted trial court error in the following particulars: in failing to give binding legal effect to the provisions of the \"Installation-Service Contract;\u201d in denying Rollins leave to amend its complaint to raise the defense of the statute of frauds; in receiving evidence as to subsequent repairs to the burglar alarm system; in giving improper instructions to the jury as to the law on breach of warranty and improper comment on the evidence pertaining thereto; and in refusing Rollins\u2019 motion for a directed verdict based on the statute of limitations contained in the Uniform Commercial Code, 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2725.\n. Part II of Rollins\u2019 Brief filed with this Court asserts that, in the event this Court were to overrule the Superior Court\u2019s determination that the appellants\u2019 filing of the complaint was outside of the statute of limitations, then this Court should reverse Superior Court\u2019s ruling that the written contract was not binding and was unenforceable, and we should modify the judgment according to the limitation of damages clause contained in said contract. We do not accept Rollins\u2019 invitation to review the Superior Court\u2019s determination of this issue, as our denial of Rollins' cross-petition for allowance of appeal (which specifically raised this issue) forecloses further review of the validity of the written contract.\n. In Nath v. National Equipment Leasing Corp., 497 Pa. 126, 439 A.2d 633 (1982), a majority of the members of this Court refused to extend the Francioni reasoning to lessors to leases that were purely finance devices securing certain goods, as opposed to conventional or \"true\u201d leases. This author dissented, joined by Justices Flaherty and Kauffman, and would have extended the Francioni decision to cover pure finance leases as well, on the grounds that many of the policy reasons for applying strict liability to sellers are equally applicable in the case of finance lessors. 497 Pa. at 133-36, 439 A.2d at 636-38.\n. These sections provide, in relevant part, as follows:\n13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2313. Express Warranties.... (a) General rule.\u2014\nExpress warranties by the seller are created as follows:\n(1) Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.\n******\n(b) Formal words or specific intent .unnecessary.\u2014\n13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2314. Implied warranty: merchantability; usage of trade\n(a) Sale by Merchant. ... a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied____\n(b) Merchantability standards for goods. \u2014 Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as:\n******\n(3) are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used____\nSection 2315, 13 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2315, provides that there is an implied warranty that the goods are fit for any particular purpose for which the seller has reason to know that the goods are required.\n. As the lease contract herein was one predominantly for goods, the UCC provisions dealing with the sale of goods apply, even though a significant aspect of the total contractual relationship involved service and maintenance of those goods. See Whitmer v. Bell Telephone Co., 361 Pa.Super. 282, 522 A.2d 584 (1987) and Annot., Applicability of UCC Article 2 To Mixed Contracts For Sale Of Goods And Services, 5\u00a1 A.L.R.4th 501 (1981).\nWhile appellants\u2019 complaint might be read as setting forth a cause of action based upon a separate contract for the service and maintenance of the burglar alarm system, appellants do not argue that a separate cause of action exists for breach of this agreement. A breach of a separate agreement for the service and/or maintenance of goods, or one predominantly for service/maintenance, would presumably be governed by the statute of limitations governing contracts in general, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 5525, although we express no opinion on this point."}
