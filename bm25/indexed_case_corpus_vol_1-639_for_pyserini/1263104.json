{"id": "1263104", "contents": "Opinion bt\nMr. Justice Allen M. Steaene,\nPlaintiff appeals from a judgment for defendant non obstante veredicto in a trespass action concerning collision of two motor vehicles. The pivotal question is whether, in the facts of this case, plaintiff\u2019s failure to stop his automobile within the assured clear distance ahead constituted contributory negligence as matter of law. The learned court below ruled that it did.\nAnthony Notarianni, the plaintiff, was driving his car northward on Fifth Street, in the City of Philadelphia. He entered a tunnel or underpass on that street, which permits traffic to pass under the approach to the Benjamin Franklin Delaware River Bridge. While in the tunnel plaintiff\u2019s automobile collided with the truck of Jackie Boss, the defendant.\nThe accident occurred shortly after noon on February 23, 1949, on a bright sunny day; the tunnel or underpass is entered by a descending ramp at the southern approach estimated to be fifty to eighty feet in length; plaintiff entered the tunnel at approximately twenty miles per hour; plaintiff\u2019s' speed at the time of the accident was variously estimated at ten to twenty miles per hour; the mouth of the tunnel, through which plaintiff passed every day, presented an appearance of d\u00e1rkness; as plaintiff drove through the tunnel he could see only five to ten feet in front of him; after proceeding twenty-five to thirty feet plaintiff saw defendant\u2019s truck ten feet in front of him; he was unable to stop in time to avoid colliding with the rear of defendant\u2019s truck; the reason assigned by plaintiff for not seeing the truck was that his vision was restricted because of the sudden change from bright daylight to darkness.\nThe Vehicle Code of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905, Art. X, \u00a71002, 75 PS 501 (a) provides, inter alia: \u201cAny person driving a vehicle on a highway shall drive the same at a careful and prudent speed . . . nor at a speed greater than will permit him to bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead.\u201d This Act has been consistently applied in cases such as the present one, where a motorist collides with the rear of a vehicle which he did not observe in time to avoid. Such motorist is guilty of contributory negligence as matter of law.\nIt is plaintiff\u2019s contention that his failure to comply with the provisions of The Yehicle Code is excused because of his alleged restriction of vision due to the sudden change from bright daylight to darkness. He relies upon Buohl v. Lockport Brewing Company, 349 Pa. 377, 37 A. 2d 524; Wolfe v. Beardsley, 357 Pa. 1, 53 A. 2d 92. These cases relate solely to situations where temporary blindness results from bright lights of another vehicle. Such principle has no application where the darkness of the tunnel was visible and apparent from fifty to eighty feet as plaintiff approached its entrance; furthermore, he had passed through this tunnel nearly every day and was fully aware of the existing condition.\nNeither vehicle had its lights turned on. Plaintiff testified \u201cWho expected [defendant\u2019s truck] to be there?\u201d But plaintiff could not assume that no obstruction would be in the darkened tunnel. In Simrell v. Eschenbach, 303 Pa. 156, 154 A. 369, speaking of the requirement that a driver of an automobile on a dark night must keep his car under such control that he may stop or turn when obstructions appear intercepting his passage, we said (p. 160) : \u201c. . . for it is possible, obstructions may appear at any time in the traveler\u2019s path, as the result of accident or otherwise.\u201d\nWhen an operator of a motor vehicle enters and passes through darkness and fog he is required to maintain such control over his automobile as enables him to stop within the assured clear distance ahead: Burkleca v. Stephens, 370 Pa. 371, 88 A. 2d 57.\nA case which involves closely analogous facts to the one now before us is Shoffner v. Schmerin, 316 Pa. 323, 175 A. 516. An automobile was being operated on a public highway and encountered patches of fog which were visible several hundred feet ahead; the motorist entered the fog, observed a truck ahead, but was unable to stop and crashed into the vehicle. Justice Maxey (later Chief Justice), speaking for the Court, said (p. 326) : \u201c. . . the evidence of plaintiffs negligence is so conclusive that it alone \u2014 regardless of whether or not there was evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence \u2014 requires the entry of judgment n.o.v. in favor of defendant. Cautious movement in fog is required of motorists (as it always has been of navigators). To take \u2018a leap in the dark\u2019 is to invite self-injury or self-destruction. . . .\u201d And also (p. 328) : \u201c. . . That he Thought this was a slight amount of fog\u2019 does not excuse him. Fog is fog and its obscurative qualities are known to all individuals who possess even the slight amount of intelligence legally required to qualify one to drive an automobile on the public highways. When plaintiff drove his car into a fog bank which hid a truck from his view, he simply spurned prudence and relied on chance. That chance failed him is his misfortune, not defendant\u2019s fault.\u201d To the same effect see: Rich v. Petersen Truck Lines, Inc., 357 Pa. 318, 53 A. 2d 725, where the motorist drove through a bank of smoke and steam. Also: Simrell v. Eschenbach, supra; Janeway v. Lafferty Brothers, 323 Pa. 324, 185 A. 827; Lauerman v. Strickler, 141 Pa. Superior Ct. 210, 14 A. 2d 608. The judgment for defendant n.o.v. was properly entered.\nJudgment affirmed."}
