{"id": "486425", "contents": "The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered\nPer Curiam.\nThe eleventh section of the Criminal Procedure Act of March- 31st 1860, has provided that \u201c every indictment shall be deemed and adjudged sufficient and good in law, which charges the crime substantially in the language of the Act of Assembly, prohibiting the crime and prescribing the punishment if any such there be.\u201d The language of the Criminal Code is, \u201c If any person shall rob another, or shall steal any property from the person of another, &c.\u201d It is not necessary that all the circumstances which enter into the definition of robbery at common law should be particularly averred in the indictment. The word rob, Avhich is used ex vi termini, includes all those circumstances, and it sufficiently appears that a taking from the person of the prosecutor and against his will, that being the legal definition of robbery, was substantially charged in the indictment.\nJudgment affirmed."}
