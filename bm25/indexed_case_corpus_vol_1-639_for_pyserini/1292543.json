The court shall have exclusive power to remove a guardian when ... (6) the incompetent of whose estate he is guardian is adjudged competent.\u201d \u201cSection 323. Adjudication of competency. The court, upon petition and after such notice as it shall direct, may find, after a hearing at which good cause is shown, that a person previously adjudged incompetent has become competent.\u201d\nThe Incompetents\u2019 Estates Act of 1955 has recently been ably analyzed by Mr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones in Myers Estate, 395 Pa. 459, 150 A. 2d 525, and further analysis is unnecessary.\nWe find no clear abuse of discretion nor error of law in the order, which is affirmed on the opinion of Judge Sporkin.\nP. L. 794, 50 PS \u00a7\u00a73101-3801 (Supp. 1958). The short title of this Act is The Incompetents\u2019 Estates Act of 1955.
