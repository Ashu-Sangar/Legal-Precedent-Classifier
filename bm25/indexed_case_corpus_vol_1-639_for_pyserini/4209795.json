{"id": "4209795", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice SAYLOR.\nThis direct appeal concerns the Commonwealth Court\u2019s jurisdiction over a suit brought by public school employees for injunctive and declaratory relief against the Office of Open Records, seeking to protect the employees\u2019 home addresses from disclosure under the Right to Know Law.\nI. Background\nAppellants are individual school employees from multiple school districts and the Pennsylvania State Education Association (\u201cPSEA\u201d), an organization whose membership consists of teachers and education support professionals (collectively, \u201cAppellants\u201d). Due to concerns surrounding the potential disclosure of school employees\u2019 names and home addresses under the recently enacted Right-to-Know Law (\u201cRTKL\u201d), see 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.101-67.3104, the PSEA sought guidance from the Office of Open Records (the \u201cOOR\u201d) in the form of an advisory opinion. The OOR, however, dismissed the request as moot, as it had already issued final determinations directing the release of public records containing school employees\u2019 home addresses. See Green v. Bethlehem Area Sch. Dist., No. AP 2009-0061, 2009 WL 6504420, at *5 (OOR Mar. 20, 2009) (\u201cThe OOR concludes that the School District could not establish a constitutional right to privacy in home addresses of private employees which is required to overcome their clear statutory exclusion.\u201d).\nSubsequently, numerous RTKL requests were filed with school districts across Pennsylvania, seeking disclosure of the names and home addresses of school employees. Of particular concern to Appellants were several requests filed by an individual utilizing a post office box because it was unclear to whom and for what purpose the information would be disseminated. Upon discovering that many school districts had not challenged, or would not challenge, the release of such information, Appellants filed a petition for review against the OOR in the Commonwealth Court, seeking preliminary and permanent injunctions prohibiting the disclosure of school employees\u2019 names and home addresses and a declaration that such information is exempt from disclosure under the RTKL. The Commonwealth Court granted two petitions to intervene by parties supporting the OOR, filed by: (1) Simon Campbell, President of StopTeacherStrikes, Inc., an advocacy group with the purpose of eliminating teacher strikes that often requests contact information for non-union school teachers, see Petition to Intervene of Simon Campbell, at 1-2; and (2) the Pennsylvania Association of School Retirees (\u201cPASR\u201d), an association of former school employees, which routinely requests the names and addresses of retired employees, see Brief of Intervenors Pennsylvania Association of School Retirees, Kirkwood, Nye, Vak and Rowland, at 5.\nBy single judge order, the Commonwealth Court granted Appellants\u2019 request for a preliminary injunction, staying the release of any home addresses and requiring the OOR to notify school districts of the existence of this litigation. See July 28, 2009 Order (Attached to Brief of Appellants as Exhibit 1). In a subsequent opinion, Judge Friedman explained that Appellants had established all of the prerequisite elements necessary for issuance of a preliminary injunction, see Summit Towne Ctr., Inc. v. Shoe Show of Rocky Mount, Inc., 578 Pa. 637, 646-47, 828 A.2d 995, 1001 (2003), and, with respect to Appellants\u2019 demonstration of a clear right to relief, specifically noted that both this Court and the Commonwealth Court have recognized that individuals possess a constitutionally protected privacy interest in their home addresses that outweighs the benefits of public disclosure. See PSEA ex rel. Wilson v. OOR, 981 A.2d 383, 385-86 (Pa.Cmwlth.2009) (citing, inter alia, Sapp Roofing Co., Inc. v. Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n, Local Union No. 12, 552 Pa. 105, 111, 713 A.2d 627, 630 (1998) (\u201cThe disclosure of personal information (names, addresses, social security numbers, and phone numbers) reveals little, if anything, about the government\u2019s (in this case the school district\u2019s) compliance with\u201d a particular statute.); Cypress Media, Inc. v. Hazleton Area Sch. Dist., 708 A.2d 866, 870 (Pa.Cmwlth.1998) (\u201c[T]his Court has held that a person\u2019s home address, home telephone number and social security number are not subject to disclosure under the [previous Right-to-Know] Act because the benefits of disclosing such information are outweighed by a person\u2019s privacy interests in that information.\u201d) (citations omitted)).\nThis Court affirmed the issuance of the preliminary injunction, \u201cwithout prejudice to any party\u2019s right to appeal the Commonwealth Court\u2019s final disposition of these proceedings.\u201d PSEA ex rel. Wilson v. OOR, 606 Pa. 638, 2 A.3d 558 (2010) (per curiam). Subsequently, the OOR filed preliminary objections, arguing, inter alia, that the Commonwealth Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that the statutory remedy provided by the RTKL was exclusive, preventing Appellants from bringing a declaratory judgment action.\nIn a divided opinion, the Commonwealth Court sustained the OOR\u2019s preliminary objections, finding that the court lacked jurisdiction because Appellants had not named an indispensable Commonwealth party as a defendant. See PSEA v. OOR, 4 A.3d 1156, 1165-66 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010) (en banc) (\u201cPSEA \u201d). The majority explained that, with certain exceptions not relevant to the present matter, it has original jurisdiction over \u201call civil actions or proceedings ... [ajgainst the Commonwealth government, including any officer thereof, acting in his official capacity.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(a)(1). However, the majority continued, simply naming a Commonwealth agency does not suffice for purposes of jurisdiction; rather, the Commonwealth agency named \u201cmust have a cognizable interest in the outcome of the action.\u201d PSEA, 4 A.3d at 1164 (citing PSEA v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 101 Pa.Cmwlth. 497, 516 A.2d 1308, 1310 (1986)); see also 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7540(a) (\u201cWhen declaratory relief is sought, all persons shall be made parties who have or claim any interest which would be affected by the declaration, and no declaration shall prejudice the rights of persons not parties to the proceeding.\u201d). The majority clarified that the Commonwealth agency must, in fact, be an indispensable party such that the proceeding \u201ccannot conceivably be concluded with meaningful relief without the sovereign state itself becoming directly involved.\u201d PSEA, 4 A.3d at 1164 (quoting Foreman v. Chester-Upland Sch. Dist., 941 A.2d 108, 113 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008)); see also CRY, Inc. v. Mill Serv., Inc., 536 Pa. 462, 469, 640 A.2d 372, 375 (1994) (stating that \u201cthe basic inquiry in determining whether a party is indispensable concerns whether justice can be done in the absence of a third party\u201d).\nIn connection with RTKL requests, the Commonwealth Court majority explained that there are only two parties, namely, the requester and the agency from which the records are sought. The majority characterized the OOR, however, as \u201cthe tribunal that resolves disputes between requesters and agencies.\u201d PSEA, 4 A.3d at 1164. As the agency is a quasi-judicial tribunal without any interest in the outcome of its adjudications, the majority reasoned, the OOR was not a proper party to the present action. See id. (citing East Stroudsburg Univ. Found. v. OOR, 995 A.2d 496, 507 (2010) (ere banc) (plurality) (holding that the OOR is not a party to appeals of its decisions because it has no interest in the release of another agency\u2019s records), appeal denied, 20 A.3d 490 (Pa.2011) (Table)). Thus, the majority concluded that the OOR could not serve as the governmental unit over which the Commonwealth Court could exercise its original jurisdiction. See id. (citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(a)(1)). Instead, the majority explained, the proper defendants were the individual school districts that actually received record requests under the RTKL. See id. at 1165. Further, the majority indicated:\nCourts enforce statutes. However, to challenge a statute or its application, it is never acceptable to name a court as the defendant. Indeed, merely to state the proposition is to refute it. It is no different for the Office of Open Records, which functions as a quasi-judicial tribunal, not a regulatory agency. It is not a proper defendant to [Appellants\u2019] action, which seeks to direct its future adjudicatory actions.\nId. Accordingly, because, absent the OOR, no Commonwealth agency was properly named as a defendant, the Commonwealth Court majority held that the court lacked jurisdiction. See id. at 1166.\nThe majority further acknowledged, although expressly did not base its decision on, see id. at 1163-64, two separate points. First, the court examined Appellants\u2019 privacy contentions, namely, that they possess a constitutionally protected privacy interest in their home addresses and that the privacy exemption judicially created under the previous version of the RTKL remained viable under the current statutory language. In this regard, the majority noted that, although the latter inquiry was \u201cfraught with challenge,\u201d id. at 1162, the former had been disposed of by this Court in Commonwealth v. Duncan, 572 Pa. 438, 817 A.2d 455 (2003), which held, \u201cconsistently with the realities of our modern, consumer age and the experience of other courts, that appellant does not have an expectation of privacy in his name and address that society is willing to recognize as reasonable and legitimate.\u201d Id. at 462, 817 A.2d at 469. But see Hartman v. Dep\u2019t of Conservation & Natural Res., 892 A.2d 897, 905 n. 19 (Pa.Cmwlth.2006) (distinguishing Duncan on the ground that, as a criminal matter, it \u201cis not applicable to a civil proceeding arising under the Right-to-Know Law\u201d).\nThe Commonwealth Court majority also recognized the possibility that it lacked jurisdiction over Appellants\u2019 declaratory judgment action because the matter was subject to \u201ca tribunal other than a court.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7541(c)(2). The majority explained that the tribunal, namely, the OOR, is tasked by statute with the adjudication of appeals concerning requests made pursuant to the RTKL. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(a). Similarly, the majority noted, the existence of an adequate statutory remedy renders the exercise of equitable jurisdiction improper. See Borough of Green Tree v. Bd. of Prop. Assessments, Appeals & Review of Allegheny Cnty., 459 Pa. 268, 276, 328 A.2d 819, 823 (1974) (plurality). With regard to the process set forth in the RTKL, the majority observed that aggrieved individuals may \u201cfile a written request to provide information or to appear before the appeals officer [of the OOR] or to file information in support of the requester\u2019s or agency\u2019s position.\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(c)(1). Following the OOR\u2019s final determination in a matter, the majority stated that \u201ca teacher may appeal that determination to the Court of Common Pleas of the County where the school district is located.\u201d PSEA, 4 A.3d at 1163 (citing 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1302(a)). Given the exclusivity of administrative remedies when available, the majority continued, even had a Commonwealth party been properly named as a defendant, a question remained as to \u201cwhether the statutory procedure established in the Right-to-Know [Law] forecloses the ability of this Court, or any court, to circumvent the statutory procedure by allowing PSEA\u2019s action for declaratory and equitable relief to proceed.\u201d Id. at 1164.\nJudge Pellegrini dissented, concluding that the Commonwealth Court had jurisdiction over the matter because the OOR, as well as the other defendants named, fell within the statutory definition of \u201cCommonwealth government\u201d:\nThe government of the Commonwealth, including the courts and other officers or agencies of the unified judicial system, the General Assembly and its officers and agencies, the Governor, and the departments, boards, commissions, authorities and officers and agencies of the Commonwealth, but the term does not include any political subdivision, municipal or other local authority, or any officer or agency of any such political subdivision or local authority.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102. Further, Judge Pellegrini believed that the court could order meaningful relief by \u201cdirecting the OOR not to order the release of home addresses of state employees,\u201d indicating that there was no lack of an indispensable party. See PSEA 4 A.3d at 1167 (Pellegrini, J., dissenting).\nHe also noted that declaratory relief is not available when the proceeding is \u201cwithin the exclusive jurisdiction of a tribunal other than a court\u201d or involves \u201can appeal from an order of a tribunal.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7541(c); see also DGS v. Frank Briscoe Co., Inc., 502 Pa. 449, 459, 466 A.2d 1336, 1341 (1983) (\u201c[T]he declaratory judgment procedure may not be used to prejudge issues that are committed for initial resolution to an administrative forum, any more than it may be used as a substitute to establish in advance the merits of an appeal from that forum.\u201d). The procedures established by the RTKL, however, Judge Pellegrini reasoned, did not provide an adequate administrative remedy that would preclude Appellant\u2019s declaratory judgment action. He explained that Section 1101(c) of the RTKL only permits a third party, such as Appellants, to provide information or appear before the OOR officer under limited circumstances, and such entities do not become parties to the action. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(c). Moreover, Judge Pellegrini continued, only the requestor and the agency from which records are requested have the right to appeal an adverse decision. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1301(a) (\u201c[A] requester or the agency may file a petition for review or other document as might be required by rule of court with the Commonwealth Court.\u201d). Because this participation is discretionary rather than of right and does not provide the right to appeal, Judge Pellegrini concluded that Appellants did not have an adequate remedy at law that would preclude their declaratory judgment action.\nAppellants appealed to this Court, arguing that the Commonwealth Court erred by refusing to exercise its original jurisdiction over their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. As the jurisdictional issue presented concerns only questions of law, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. See Blount v. Philadelphia Parking Auth., 600 Pa. 277, 281, 965 A.2d 226, 229 (2009).\nII. Arguments\nAppellants argue that the Commonwealth Court erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction because the OOR was not an indispensable party. See PSEA, 4 A.3d at 1164. They explain that the Commonwealth Court possesses original jurisdiction over matters in which the agencies or officers of the Commonwealth government are parties, see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(a)(1), and that the OOR, as well as the other named defendants, plainly fall within the statutory definition of \u201cCommonwealth government,\u201d as they are \u201cofficers and agencies of the Commonwealth.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102. Further, Appellants contend that the OOR has a significant interest in the outcome of this case because it is the administrative agency charged with interpreting and enforcing the RTKL. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1310 (establishing the OOR within the Department of Community and Economic Development). East Stroudsburg, 995 A.2d at 507, Appellants note, is not to the contrary, as that case addressed the OOR\u2019s standing to participate in appeals of its final determinations rather than the propriety of an independent action against the OOR. See id. at 506. Moreover, Appellants contend, it is an unwarranted extension of the reasoning in that case for the Commonwealth Court to hold that, simply because the OOR is not \u201caggrieved\u201d by the release of another agency\u2019s records, see id., it has no interest in defending its interpretation of the RTKL in a declaratory judgment action.\nThe OOR\u2019s interest is especially pronounced in the present matter, Appellants argue, because proceedings before the OOR pursuant to the RTKL are unavailable to third parties, such as individual employees of a local agency, even where the substantive rights of such parties will be adversely affected by the release of records. Although Appellants acknowledge that they may be permitted to provide information or appear before an OOR appeals officer, they maintain that the officer has no statutory obligation to allow such limited participation. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(c). Further, Appellants observe that, even if they were permitted such participation, they would have no right to appeal the final determination. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1301(a) (\u201ca requester or the agency may file a petition for review or other document as might be required by rule of court with the Commonwealth Court\u201d). Similarly, Appellants assert that, \u201c[wjhere the administrative process has nothing to contribute to the decision of the issue and there are no special reasons for postponing its immediate decision,\u201d they should not be required to engage in a futile attempt to utilize a statutory process that is not available to them in the first instance. See Borough of Green Tree, 459 Pa. at 279, 328 A.2d at 824 (quoting L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 440 (1965)); see also Lutz v. City of Philadelphia, 6 A.3d 669, 671 n. 3 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010) (noting that a declaratory judgment suit was proper where the plaintiff \u201chad no other recourse since it could not directly seek administrative relief under the Right-to-Know Law\u201d and that \u201cthe requested ] was the only potentially directly aggrieved party\u201d). Further, Appellants contend that the OOR\u2019s expertise in finding facts and adjudicating disputes concerning the production of public records would not contribute to the resolution of their constitutional privacy and due process claims, particularly as the OOR\u2019s position on the issue has been aptly demonstrated by its numerous determinations ordering the production of school employees\u2019 home addresses. See, e.g., Green, 2009 WL 6504420, at *5.\nGiven the statutory framework, Appellants argue that the RTKL is unconstitutional \u2014 either on its face or as applied to the disclosure of public school employees\u2019 home addresses\u2014 because it deprives them of their fundamental right to privacy without due process of law. Appellants note that due process applies to administrative agency proceedings and requires notice and an opportunity to be heard. See Kowenhoven v. Cnty. of Allegheny, 587 Pa. 545, 555-56, 901 A.2d 1003, 1009-10 (2006) (\u201cDue process principles apply to quasi-judicial or administrative proceedings and require an opportunity, inter alia, to hear the evidence adduced by the opposing party, cross-examine witnesses, introduce evidence on one\u2019s own behalf, and present argument.\u201d) (citations omitted). However, Appellants aver, the RTKL does not provide these basic constitutional requirements. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1303(a) (providing notice of appeals from OOR adjudications and \u201can opportunity to respond\u201d only to \u201c[a]n agency, the requester and the Office of Open Records or designated appeals officer\u201d); 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(c) (permitting third parties with a direct interest to submit information or appear at a hearing before the OOR only at the appeals officer\u2019s discretion); 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1309 (exempting the OOR from the provisions of the administrative agency law, including those that require notice and hearing).\nIn this regard, Appellants observe that, under the former version of the Right-to-Know Act, courts had engaged in a balancing test, weighing the individual\u2019s privacy interest against a countervailing state interest, such as, for example, transparency in governmental spending, prior to disclosure. See Sapp Roofing, 552 Pa. at 111, 713 A.2d at 630 (\u201c[A]fter balancing this weak public interest in disclosure of the information and the unproven ability of the release of the requested information to assist in the enforcement of the prevailing wage laws against the individual\u2019s right to privacy and personal security, the Court concludes that the personal information is not releasable.\u201d); see also PSU v. SERB, 594 Pa. 244, 258-59, 935 A.2d 530, 538 (2007) (explaining that the Sapp Roofing \u201canalysis subsumes the question of whether the potential impairment of any privacy interest outweighs the public interest in the dissemination at issue\u201d). This balancing test, Appellants continue, although nominally premised upon an interpretation of the former statute\u2019s \u201cpersonal security\u201d exception, see PSU, 594 Pa. at 258, 935 A.2d at 538, was constitutionally mandated because a fundamental right to privacy arises under Article I, Sections 1 and 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution. See Sapp Roofing, 552 Pa. at 111, 713 A.2d at 630 (\u201cPennsylvania recognizes the right to privacy in Article I, \u00a7 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, and this Court often invokes this right to privacy to give greater protection to our citizens than that found in the United States Constitution.\u201d); Denoncourt v. Commonwealth, State Ethics Comm\u2019n, 504 Pa. 191, 198, 470 A.2d 945, 948 (1983) (\u201cThe interest in avoiding a disclosure of personal matters, this Court has said, \u2018finds explicit protection in the Pennsylvania Constitution, Art. 1, \u00a7 1----\u2019\u201d) (quoting In re June 1979 Allegheny Cnty. Investigating Grand Jury, 490 Pa. 143, 150-51, 415 A.2d 73, 77 (1980) (plurality)). Although there may be cases in which the scales tip in favor of disclosure, see, e.g., Duncan, 572 Pa. at 462, 817 A.2d at 469, Appellants contend that the balancing test must still be applied in order to adequately protect the fundamental constitutional right involved.\nAppellants analogize this matter to Kowenhoven, 587 Pa. at 545, 901 A.2d at 1003, which involved claims for declaratory and injunctive relief in connection with the allegedly unconstitutional application of procedures implemented by a local agency for tax assessment appeals. See id. at 548, 901 A.2d at 1005. Despite the existence of an administrative process, Appellants explain, this Court permitted the common pleas court to address the principal constitutional claims, noting that \u201cconcerns over piecemeal litigation and inefficiency occasioned by strict adherence to the statutory appeal process are present here ...; thus, a multiplicity of individual de novo appeals to the trial court may be avoided through judicial review of the constitutionality of the Board\u2019s overall procedures.\u201d Id. at 559, 901 A.2d at 1012. Similarly, Appellants continue, their claims raise constitutional issues concerning the disclosure of private information that is not only better suited to a determination via declaratory judgment, but also will not be adequately adjudicated or protected through the administrative process. Hence, because they do not have the right to participate in any statutory procedure in which their claims could be adjudicated and because the OOR is an indispensable Commonwealth party, Appellants conclude that a declaratory judgment action is appropriate, see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7541, and that original jurisdiction lies with the Commonwealth Court, see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(a).\nIn response, the OOR argues that it cannot be an indispensable party to the present matter, as it is a quasi-judicial tribunal that is not \u201caggrieved by the release of another agency\u2019s records.\u201d East Stroudsburg, 995 A.2d at 507; see also PSP v. OOR, 5 A.3d 473, 476 n. 3 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010) (\u201c[T]he OOR does not have standing to participate as a party in petitions for review from its determinations.\u201d) (citing East Stroudsburg, 995 A.2d at 507). The OOR contends that it satisfies the statutory definition of a \u201ctribunal,\u201d see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102, because it is a government unit that has quasi-judicial functions, including the power to issue orders and opinions. See 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.1102(a)(4), 67.1310(a)(5). The OOR also describes its role in the administrative appeal process in connection with other agencies\u2019 responses to RTKL requests as encompassing the two defining functions of a quasi-judicial tribunal, namely, reviewing evidence and entering orders. Thus, the OOR continues, if an injunction were directed to the agency, it would have the impermissible effect of dictating the OOR\u2019s adjudicatory decisions. See PSEA, 4 A.3d at 1164.\nMoreover, the OOR avers that: it was created to serve primarily as an adjudicator of disputes, see 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(a)(1); it does not possess any of the requested records that form the basis of Appellants\u2019 claims; and its role in the process consists merely of issuing binding final determinations when an aggrieved party files an appeal under the RTKL, see 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(b). In this regard, the OOR observes that any party with a direct interest in the matter may participate in proceedings before an OOR appeals officer. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(c). Indeed, the OOR notes, PSEA has done so on numerous occasions. See, e.g., Campbell v. Cent. York Sch. Dist., No. AP 2009-0432, 2009 WL 6504528, at *3 (OOR July 2, 2009) (\u201cIn this case, the OOR granted PSEA\u2019s request to submit information on behalf of [the school superintendent], thus dispelling any due process concerns.\u201d). Acknowledging that caselaw concerning the statutory appeal process is divergent, the OOR nonetheless asserts that an interested party may appeal a final determination to the appropriate court. See, e.g., In re Silberstein, 11 A.3d 629, 631 n. 4 (Pa.Cmwlth.2011) (noting that, although he was not a party to the matter, \u201c[t]he trial court found that Silberstein had standing to pursue an appeal because he had a direct interest in the matter\u201d); East Stroudsburg, 995 A.2d at 498 n. 2 (noting that the Commonwealth Court had previously determined that a non-party with a \u201cdirect interest\u201d in the case could appeal, even though such a right was not provided for within the RTKL, as a result of \u201cdue process safeguards\u201d). But see Allegheny Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Admin. Servs. v. A Second Chance, Inc., 13 A.3d 1025, 1034 (Pa.Cmwlth.2011) (granting intervention in judicial proceedings, rather than a right to appeal, following a directly interested party\u2019s participation in an OOR adjudication).\nThis process, the OOR continues, is of substantial benefit, given the fact-specific nature of disputes concerning the production of records under the RTKL, which may include such issues as what records are at issue, how local agencies have responded to the requests, what exemptions, if. any, apply, and what harm, if any, will result from the release of information. Indeed, the OOR explains that this Court has recognized the exclusivity of the administrative process in order to permit the \u201cagency involved to throw light on the issue through exercise of its specialized fact-finding function or application of its administrative expertise.\u201d Borough of Green Tree, 459 Pa. at 281, 328 A.2d at 825; see also Parsowith v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 555 Pa. 200, 207, 723 A.2d 659, 662 (1999) (\u201cPennsylvania appellate courts regularly require adherence to the statutorily-prescribed administrative process.\u201d). Thus, the OOR develops, its administrative expertise in this arena should be respected. See Terminato v. Pa. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., 538 Pa. 60, 69, 645 A.2d 1287, 1291 (1994) (\u201cWhen the Legislature has seen fit to enact a pervasive regulatory scheme and to establish a governmental agency possessing expertise and broad regulatory and remedial powers to administer that statutory scheme, a court should be reluctant to interfere in those matters and disputes which were intended by the Legislature to be considered, at least initially, by the administrative agency.\u201d) (quoting Feingold v. Bell of Pa., 477 Pa. 1, 5, 383 A.2d 791, 793 (1977)).\nAs to Appellants\u2019 asserted constitutional claims, the OOR contends that Appellants cannot succeed on the merits of their declaratory judgment action because this Court has held that names and home addresses are not protected by Article I, Section 8. See Duncan, 572 Pa. at 455, 817 A.2d at 465 (\u201c[A]ny subjective expectation of privacy that appellant may have had in the name and address information is not an expectation which society would be willing to recognize as objectively reasonable in light of the realities of our modern age.\u201d). The OOR observes that, in addition to the inclusion of names and addresses in telephone books, numerous statutes specifically define certain documents that include home addresses as public records. See, e.g., 25 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1207(a)(3) (voter registration applications); 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1302, 1309 (marriage licenses); 72 P.S. \u00a7 5341.6 (records of tax assessments); 16 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9781, 9782 (recording of deeds, mortgages or assignments). Disclosure under the RTKL, the OOR asserts, is no different. Further, the OOR notes, the new version of the RTKL significantly differs from the prior statute, particularly with regard to the definition of \u201cpublic record\u201d and the \u201cpersonal security\u201d exception. See Bowling v. OOR, 990 A.2d 813, 823 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010), appeal granted in part, 609 Pa. 265 (2011). In this regard, the OOR maintains that caselaw concerning a privacy interest was premised upon the statutory language rather than any constitutional right, rendering the balancing test promoted by Appellants obsolete. See PSU, 594 Pa. at 258, 935 A.2d at 538 (\u201c[W]hile Appellants invite this Court to separate our right to privacy analysis from our personal security exception analysis, it is clear that no such division is warranted.\u201d). Instead, the OOR avers, an agency seeking to deny access to a document by reference to the personal security exception must demonstrate that disclosure would be \u201creasonably likely to result in a substantial and demonstrable risk of physical harm to or the personal security of an individual.\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(l)(ii). The OOR argues that this statutory analysis replaces the balancing test applied under the previous version of the RTKL. The OOR also disputes Appellants\u2019 reliance on Kowenhoven, as that case was a class action arising out of specific actions taken by a local agency during its appeal process. See Kowenhoven, 587 Pa. at 548, 901 A.2d at 1005. By contrast, the OOR distinguishes the present circumstances as involving no specific challenge to any action taken by the OOR.\nGiven its quasi-judicial role as well as Appellants\u2019 ability to participate in administrative proceedings, the OOR concludes that it cannot be an indispensable party to this case. See PSEA v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 516 A.2d at 1310 (\u201c[A] Commonwealth agency should not be declared an indispensable party unless meaningful relief cannot conceivably be afforded without the sovereign itself becoming involved.\u201d); Annenberg v. Commonwealth, 686 A.2d 1380, 1385 (Pa.Cmwlth.1996) (concluding that, where \u201cthe involvement of the Commonwealth is minimal,\u201d the Commonwealth is not an indispensable party).\nIII. Discussion\nUpon our review, we agree with Appellants\u2019 central position that the OOR may fairly be regarded as an indispensable party to their efforts to secure a just, timely, and meaningful judicial resolution of their claims.\nAs a threshold matter, Appellants have amply established that \u2014 although school employees have (at the very least) a colorable interest in the grant or denial of RTKL requests for their personal address information \u2014 the RTKL does not make them parties to the request or the ensuing appeal process. Indeed, affected school employees are not so much as afforded required notice of requests and/or proceedings before the OOR. While the OOR portrays itself as a quasi-judicial tribunal relative to Appellants\u2019 interests, it offers an exceptionally weak rejoinder to Appellants\u2019 notice-related concerns. In this regard, the OOR merely observes that local agencies such as school districts may adopt rules to provide adequate notice. See Brief for the OOR at 9. Indeed, the OOR\u2019s position that affected school employees receive adequate process depends on a series of such mere possibilities: each of the some 500 school districts statewide may or may not adopt an individualized notice policy; a school employee whose address is requested may or may not receive notice of the request; a school district may or may not disclose the information to requestors; if a district does not disclose, and upon a request- or\u2019s appeal, the OOR may or may not permit the affected schoolteacher to participate in the proceedings; and the school employee may or may not be aware of any further appeal proceedings in the judiciary.\nAs has been observed previously on a number of occasions, the RTKL presents numerous and substantial interpretive challenges. See, e.g., East Stroudsburg, 995 A.2d at 508 n. 4 (Leadbetter, J., concurring) (\u201cWe are here faced with a new statute which embodies not only new rules, but an entirely new conceptual and procedural framework. Many of these new concepts are provided in statutory language susceptible of multiple interpretations.\u201d). The OOR, as the agency charged with the implementation of the open-records scheme, has settled on a construction which permits the disclosure of personal information of school employees without any requirement that notice be provided to such individuals. Although there are hundreds of school districts in Pennsylvania with tens of thousands of employees, it is the OOR\u2019s position that the notice issue should nevertheless be addressed only at the local level, despite the OOR\u2019s statutory authority to \u201cpromulgate regulations relating to appeals involving a Commonwealth agency or local agency.\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.504(a).\nPlainly, the RTKL, as presently implemented by the OOR, does not provide public school employees with a reliable administrative or judicial method by which to seek redress for action that they believe violates the statutory scheme and/or their constitutional rights. In these unique circumstances, we have no difficulty in concluding that it is just and proper for the OOR to be haled into court to address core and colorable issues connected with such treatment at the behest of affected persons and their associations. In this regard, the issues raised by Appellants \u2014 including the propriety of the OOR\u2019s construction of the RTKL as eliminating the previous balancing test, see Sapp Roofing, 552 Pa. at 111, 713 A.2d at 630, and of the constitutionality of such a modification, see PSU, 594 Pa. at 258, 935 A.2d at 538 \u2014 qualify as such important, foundational concerns.\nBy way of analogy, it is in circumstances such as these\u2014 where the administrative process is inadequate to address the claim and where a substantial constitutional issue is raised \u2014 in which courts have fashioned a limited exception to the general rule requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies and instead permitted an aggrieved party to bring a declaratory judgment action in court. See, e.g., Kowenhoven, 587 Pa. at 559 n. 8, 901 A.2d at 1012 n. 8 (\u201c[Wjhat is required to confer jurisdiction on an equity court is the existence of a substantial question of constitutionality (and not a mere allegation) and the absence of an adequate statutory remedy.\u201d) (quoting Borough of Green Tree, 459 Pa. at 274, 328 A.2d at 822); Parsowith, 555 Pa. at 207, 723 A.2d at 662 (characterizing the inquiry as a \u201cflexible, case-specific approach which permits a narrow category of claims to bypass the ordinary route of appeal, where pursuit of statutory remedies would be pointless, or such remedies would be inadequate\u201d) (citation omitted); Shenango Valley Osteopathic Hosp. v. Dep\u2019t of Health, 499 Pa. 39, 48, 451 A.2d 434, 438 (1982) (\u201c[T]he doctrine of exhaustion of remedies would not bar equitable intervention where there are both a substantial question of constitutionality and the absence of an adequate statutory remedy.\u201d) (emphasis in original). Similarly, this Court has repeatedly emphasized that the avoidance of numerous, duplicative lawsuits supports the propriety of pursuing judicial, rather than statutory, remedies. See, e.g., Kowenhoven, 587 Pa. at 559, 901 A.2d at 1012 (\u201c[A] multiplicity of individual de novo appeals to the trial court may be avoided through judicial review of the constitutionality of the Board\u2019s overall procedures.\u201d); Pentlong Corp. v. GLS Capital, Inc., 573 Pa. 34, 43-44, 820 A.2d 1240, 1245-46 (2003) (\u201cWhere, for instance, a legal remedy would result in a multiplicity of duplicative lawsuits and, in contrast, an action in equity would provide a tidy global resolution, this Court has found the legal remedy to be inadequate.\u201d) (superseded by statute on other grounds, 53 P.S. \u00a7 7106).\nSignificantly, as the Commonwealth Court recognized, determining whether \u201cthe privacy exception and its attendant balancing test have continued viability under the new Law is a proposition fraught with challenge.\u201d PSEA, 4 A.3d at 1162. Indeed, the parties\u2019 arguments demonstrate the substantial reasoning supporting both sides of this question and, absent recourse to the declaratory judgment avenue, it is unclear how Appellants would be able to obtain timely, meaningful judicial review of the issue. Cf. Ohio Cas. Group of Ins. Cos. v. Argonaut Ins. Co., 514 Pa. 430, 437, 525 A.2d 1195, 1198 (1987) (\u201c[I]t is clear that without a concrete procedural remedy the litigant could in no way achieve a resolution of his claim except by the grace of the party against whom he is proceeding.\u201d). Particularly in the absence of administrative or judicial process reliably afforded to affected school employees, we find that the circumstances fall well within the contemplation of the General Assembly in its prescription of the Declaratory Judgment Act. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7541(a) (\u201cThis subchapter is declared to be remedial. Its purpose is to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and insecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations, and is to be liberally construed and administered.\u201d).\nIn determining whether a party is indispensable, the basic inquiry remains \u201cwhether justice can be done in the absence of a third party.\u201d CRY, 536 Pa. at 469, 640 A.2d at 375. Here, we conclude that justice cannot be done in the OOR\u2019s absence.\nAccordingly, the decision of the Commonwealth Court is vacated, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Jurisdiction is relinquished.\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices BAER, TODD and. McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a Concurring Opinion in which Justice Baer joins.\nJustice TODD files a Concurring Opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a Dissenting Opinion.\n.

The Commonwealth Court also dissolved the preliminary injunction, but this Court stayed such order pending resolution of this appeal. See PSEA v. OOR, No. 195 MM 2010, 2010 WL 8795339 (Pa. Nov. 1, 2010) (per curiam).\n. Section 1101(c) of the RTKL provides:\n(1) A person other than the agency or requester with a direct interest in the record subject to an appeal under this section may, within 15 days following receipt of actual knowledge of the appeal but no later than the date the appeals officer issues an order, file a written request to provide information or to appear before the appeals officer or to file information in support of the requester's or agency's position.\n(2) The appeals officer may grant a request under paragraph (1) if:\n(i) no hearing has been held;\n(ii) the appeals officer has not yet issued its order; and\n(iii) the appeals officer believes the information will be probative.\n65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(c)(l)-(2).\n. Section 1302 provides, in pertinent part:\nWithin 30 days of the mailing date of the final determination of the appeals officer relating to a decision of a local agency issued under section 1101(b) or of the date a request for access is deemed denied, a requester or local agency may file a petition for review or other document as required by rule of court with the court of common pleas for the county where the local agency is located.\n65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1302(a).\n. Although he would have overruled the OOR's preliminary objections with regard to the jurisdictional issues, Judge Pellegrini would have sustained them on the merits \"[bjecause there is no constitutional right to privacy in Pennsylvania that protects disclosure of home addresses and no provision in the RTKL that grants a statutory right to nondisclosure of public employee home addresses.\u201d PSEA v. OOR, 4 A.3d 1156, 1171 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010) (\u201cPSEA\") (Pellegrini, J., dissenting). Judge McCullough joined Judge Pellegrini's dissent with regard to the jurisdictional question, but she would have overruled the preliminary objections, applied the personal security exemption, see 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.708(b)(l)(ii)(A), and permitted Appellants the opportunity to demonstrate that \"public disclosure of the teachers' home addresses could jeopardize their personal security, and thus constitute an unwarranted invasion of their personal privacy.\u201d PSEA, 4 A.3d at 1174-75 (McCullough, J., dissenting).\n. Intervenors PASR and Campbell filed briefs asserting the same arguments as the OOR. Several unions representing teachers and state employees filed a joint amicus brief in support of Appellants, forwarding similar jurisdictional and substantive contentions. See Brief of Amici Curiae, Council 13, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO; District Council 47, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO; Local 22, International Association of Firefighters; and the Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, Local 3, AFT, AFL-CIO, in support of Appellants. Two additional amicus briefs were also filed, but neither addressed the jurisdictional questions presently before this Court. See Brief of Amicus Curiae, Office of General Counsel, in support of Appellants; Brief of Amicus Curiae, SEIU Healthcare Pennsylvania, in support of OOR.\n. Respectfully, Justice Eakin's conclusion that \"inconvenience does not equate to inadequacy,\u201d Dissenting Opinion at 522, 50 A.3d at 1283, does not account for the fact that Appellants cannot as of right intervene in or appeal from proceedings before the OOR, regardless of the strength of their interest in the subject of such proceedings. See 65 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 67.1101(c), 67.1301(a). At the OOR level, Appellants\u2019 participation in this process is subject to the discretion of the OOR appeals officer, who may or may not permit Appellants to submit information or appear at a hearing and present evidence. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(c). This participation is further limited by the fact that the appeals officer may not, by statute, permit such participation if a hearing has already been held. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(c)(2)(i). In addition, the RTKL restricts the time period in which Appellants may seek to provide information to the OOR appeals officer to \"within 15 days following receipt of actual knowledge of the appeal but no later than the date the appeals officer issues an order,\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1101(c), despite the fact that notice of any appeal from an OOR adjudication must be provided only to \"an agency, the requester and the Office of Open Records or designated appeals officer.\u201d 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1303(a). Furthermore, the OOR, by statute, is not required to conform to the notice and hearing provisions generally applicable under the administrative agency law. See 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1309.\n. Certainly, at least two members of the Commonwealth Court believed the balancing test retains continuing force under the RTKL. See PSEA ex rel. Wilson v. OOR, 981 A.2d 383, 385-86 (Pa.Cmwlth.2009) (opinion of Senior Judge Friedman) (granting preliminary injunction based on conclusion that Appellants' \"privacy interest outweighs the Commonwealth's interest\u201d), aff'd, 606 Pa. 638, 2 A.3d 558 (2010) (per curiam); PSEA, 4 A.3d at 1174 (McCullough, J., dissenting) (\"I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the personal security exception provided by the former version of the RTKL has been replaced by a personal security exception to which the judicially created privacy right and corresponding balancing test no longer apply.\u201d). It is also noteworthy that the Office of General Counsel advocates the same position. See Brief of Amicus Curiae Office of General Counsel at 6-15.\n. We acknowledge that issues connected with the personal security exception are wending their way through the courts, and, with regard to employee home address information, the Commonwealth Court does not appear to be applying the balancing test pertaining under the prior open-records regime. See, e.g., Delaware Cnty. v. Schaefer, 45 A.3d 1149, 1157-59 (Pa.Cmwlth.2012). The present declaratory judgment proceedings will afford the intermediate court the opportunity to clarify its position in this regard, as applied to a discrete category of public employees.\n. Obviously, due process is a prominent concern underlying our approach here. See generally Kowenhoven, 587 Pa. at 555-56, 901 A.2d at 1009-10; East Stroudsburg, 995 A.2d at 499 n. 2 (\u2018\u2018[D]ue process safeguards in the Pennsylvania and United States Constitutions required that before any direct interest was affected, the party had to be given an opportunity to be heard.\u201d) (citing, inter alia, Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334, 96 S.Ct. 893, 902, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976)); see also Pa. Coal Min. Ass'n v. Ins. Dep't, 471 Pa. 437, 451, 370 A.2d 685, 692 (1977) (\u201d[P]rocedural protection should be given before the government takes action which threatens to deprive a citizen of an interest, unless important governmental interests, or the preservation of the interests of others, require otherwise.\u201d). In this regard, we note that the dissent does not proffer any adequate, alternative procedure by which Appellants would be able to, as of right, obtain review of their constitutional claims, even though such claims have already been deemed sufficient to justify the issuance of a preliminary injunction. See Pennsylvania State Educ. Ass\u2019n ex rel. Wilson v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Community & Econ. Dev., Office of Open Records, 981 A.2d 383, 385-86 (Pa.Cmwlth.2009), aff'd, 606 Pa. 638, 2 A.3d 558 (2010) (per curiam)."}
