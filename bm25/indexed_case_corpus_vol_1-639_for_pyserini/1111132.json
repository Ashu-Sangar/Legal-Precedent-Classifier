{"id": "1111132", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nTestator devised his estate in trust for a son and daughter, \u201cfor their maintenance and education,\u201d directing that the trustees named by him, \u2014 a trust company and certain individuals, \u2014 should invest the fund so that it would \u201cbear sufficient interest\u201d to pay for such \u201ceducation and maintenance.\u201d He further particularly directed that the trustees should \u201cnot deliver over any of the principal......until such time as [they] in their judgment deem[ed] it wise and prudent to deliver over the same,\u201d and that, \u201cwhen in the best judgment of [such trustees] they deem[ed] it wise and prudent to deliver over to [testator\u2019s two children] or the survivor of them the principal of said trust fund,\u201d they might do so. Finally, he provided that, \u201cin the event of both......children dying without issue,\u201d the property was to go to certain named beneficiaries.\nThe testator died in 1909 and his son in 1917. The daughter, who is of full age, married and has two children, claiming that the trust should no longer legally continue, demanded that the trustees turn over the fund to her. The trustees answered that they did not deem it wise and prudent, or for the best interest of the petitioner, \u201cto turn over to her said estate other than the interest thereof for her maintenance\u201d\u2019 which they declared was being regularly done. The trustees averred also that, if the corpus were turned over- to the petitioner, \u201cthe same would, in every likelihood, he dissipated and lost.\u201d\nThe court below refused the relief prayed for, stating: \u201cAs this record stands, the prayer of the petition should not be granted because the contingent remaindermen have not been made parties to the proceeding; before an order could he made dissolving this trust, the contingent remaindermen are entitled to have their day in court.\u201d For present purposes, it is sufficient to say that, under the principles laid down by this court in Spring\u2019s Est., 216 Pa. 529, the trust here attacked is not an unlawful one, and the conclusion of the court below to the effect that, in the proceedings before it, this trust could not he declared at an end, was undoubtedly right. Before an order such as that prayed for could be judicially considered, or a definitive construction he placed on the property rights of others, possibly here involved, the petitioner would have to bring upon the record of any proceeding instituted for that purpose every person with any possible interest whatsoever in the trust; which would mean petitioner\u2019s minor children (including both those already horn and those who might hereafter he born), through properly appointed representatives (Smith\u2019s Petition, 291 Pa. 129, 132), and likewise all persons possessed of a possible ultimate beneficial interest in case of the death of petitioner without children.\nThe decree appealed from is affirmed at cost of appellant."}
