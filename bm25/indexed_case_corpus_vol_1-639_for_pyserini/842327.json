{"id": "842327", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe think the learned judge of the court below properly disposed of this case. The return of service is sufficient on its face. If for any reason it should have been set aside the application should have been made before or concurrently with the liling of answers to the interrogatories. None was made. The case was heard on its merits, and the judgment is now affirmed."}
