{"id": "1289125", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nS. Emma P. Hope died on April 13, 1914, leaving no children or issue to survive her. By her v/ill she gave, devised and bequeathed her residuary estate to her trastees on three separate trusts: A trust to pay the income to her sister, Annie J. Thompson, for her life; another trust to pay the income* to her niece, Helen Thompson Theobald, for her life; and another trust to pay the income* to her niece, Lillian Pennell Thompson Walls, for her life. Mrs. Hope\u2019s sister, Annie J. Thompson, died February 19, 1937, leaving to survive her two children, Helen Thompson Theobald and Lillian Pennell Thompson Walls. Mrs. Hope\u2019s niece, Helen Theobald, died January 16, 1942, leaving to survive her four children: Dorothy Theobald Poor-man, Herbert Pennell Theobald, Frederick Thompson Theobald, and B. Franklin Theobald. B. Franklin Theobald died qn May 21, 1952, without children or issue. Mrs. Hope\u2019s niece, Lillian Pennell Thompson Walls, died August 28,1958, without children or issue.\nThe lower Court awarded %th of the principal of Lillian Walls\u2019 trust to Herbert Pennell Theobald, %th to Frederick Thompson Theobald, %th to Dorothy Theobald Poorman, and %.th to the executor of the will of B. Franklin Theobald, Deceased.\nThe question involved in this appeal is whether the Orphans\u2019 Court erred in awarding a Y^th share to B. Franklin Theobald\u2019s executor, when B. Franklin had survived his mother but predeceased his Aunt Lillian Walls. The lower Court awarded this ^th share to the executor of B. Franklin under the theory that B. Franklin had a vested instead of a contingent interest therein.\nMrs. Hope\u2019s trust for her niece Helen Theobald and her trust for her niece Lillian Walls were, in all material respects, exactly the same and were somewhat complicated. With respect to the trust for Helen Theobald, Mrs. Hope directed her trustees, after Helen\u2019s death, to pay the net income to Helen\u2019s \u201cchildren who \u00abhall then be living and the issue of any such as shall then be deceased, in equal parts and shares, . . . until the arrival of the youngest child of my said niece at the full age of twenty-one years. And from and immediately after the death of my said niece and the arrival of her youngest child at the full age of twenty-one years, then and in such event I do give devise and bequeath the principal of the trust estate of my said niece to each and every her child and children who shall then be livingMrs. Hope\u2019s trust for her niece Helen Theobald and her trust for her niece Lillian Walls were, in all material respects, exactly the same and were somewhat complicated. With respect to the trust for Helen Theobald, Mrs. Hope directed her trustees, after Helen\u2019s death, to pay the net income to Helen\u2019s \u201cchildren who \u00abhall then be living and the issue of any such as shall then be deceased, in equal parts and shares, . . . until the arrival of the youngest child of my said niece at the full age of twenty-one years. And from and immediately after the death of my said niece and the arrival of her youngest child at the full age of twenty-one years, then and in such event I do give devise and bequeath the principal of the trust estate of my said niece to each and every her child and children who shall then be living and the issue of any such as shall then be deceased per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d\nHelen Theobald had four children, each of whom survived her, and all of them were living when her youngest child attained the age of twenty-one years. The principal of the Helen Theobald trust was thereupon paid and distributed in four equal shares to Helen\u2019s four children, Dorothy Hope T. Poorman, Herbert Pennell Theobald, Frederick Thompson Theobald, and B. Franklin Theobald. B. Franklin survived his mother, but predeceased his aunt, Lillian P. T. Walls, who, we repeat, died August 28, 1958, without issue. The executor of the will of B. Franklin was awarded by the Orphans\u2019 Court, we repeat, a %th interest in the principal of Lillian Walls\u2019 trust.\nThe Lillian Walls\u2019 trust and the Helen Thompson Theobald trust each contained the following additional provision:\n\u201cShould however my said niece die without leaving any child children or issue her surviving, or should said child or children all die in their minority, then and in such an event I do give devise and bequeath the principal of her said trust estate to my said trustees to be held by them In Trust for my said sister Annie J. Thompson and my said niece Helen Thompson Theobald upon the same uses and trusts as are herein expressed for them concerning their share in my said residuary estate. Provided, however that in no event shall any husband of my said niece receive any portion of my estate.\u201d\nThe pole star in the interpretation of every will is the intention of the testator. This intention is to be determined from the language of his entire will construed in the light of the circumstances surrounding him when he made it. \u201cIn determining the testator\u2019s intention \u2014 if no uncertainty or ambiguity exists \u2014 his meaning must be ascertained from the language of his will; it is not what the Court thinks he might or would have said in the existing circumstances, or even what the Court thinks he meant to say, but what is the meaning of his words: Conner\u2019s Estate, 346 Pa. 271, 29 A. 2d 514; Ludwick\u2019s Estate, 269 Pa. 365, 112 A. 543\u201d: Britt Estate, 369 Pa. 450, 454-455, 87 A. 2d 243. See to the same effect: Beisgen Estate, 387 Pa. 425, 430, 128 A. 2d 52.\nIn Bald Estate, 385 Pa. 176, 122 A. 2d 294, the Court, quoting from Dunlap Estate, 381 Pa. 328, 331, 112 A. 2d 349, said (page 181) : \u201c \u2018The pole star which the Courts seek to ascertain in every will is the testator\u2019s intent. . . \u201cWhen the intention of the testator can be ascertained by an examination of his entire will . . . \u2018technical rules or canons of construction are unnecessary ...\u2019\u201d: Edmunds Estate, 374 Pa. 26, 97 A. 2d 75\u2019.\n\u201c \u2018 . it is only where the intent is uncertain or the language ambiguous that such canons should be resorted to: Haydon\u2019s Estate, 334 Pa. 403, 6 A. 2d 581; Snyder Estate, 359 Pa. 138, 58 A. 2d 178; Walker\u2019s Estate, 344 Pa. 576, 26 A. 2d 456\u2019: Britt Estate, 369 Pa. 450, 455, 87 A. 2d 243.\u201d \u2019: McFadden Estate, 381 Pa. 464, 112 A. 2d 148.\u201d\nMrs. Hope provided that if her niece Lillian died without leaving any surviving child or issue \u201cthen and in such an event I do give devise and bequeath the principal of her said trust estate to my said trustees to be held by them In Trust for . . . my said niece Helen Thompson Theobald upon the same uses and trusts as are herein expressed for [her] concerning [her] share in my said residuary estate.\u201d Mrs. Hope made no gift by this paragraph to Helen\u2019s children or issue \u2014 surviving or otherwise \u2014 or indeed to her niece Helen. Instead she clearly gave the principal of Lillian\u2019s trust to Mrs. Hope\u2019s trustees \u201cto be held by them in trust . . . upon the same uses and trusts as are herein expressed for [Helen] concerning [her] share in my [Mi\u2019s. Hope\u2019s] said residuary estate.\u201d It would seem therefore, at least at first blush, as if the language of Mrs. Hope\u2019s will gave the principal of Lillian\u2019s trust to Trustees to be held upon the same trusts and to be paid to the same persons and upon the same terms and conditions as were provided for in Helen\u2019s trust.\nSince Helen\u2019s son, B. Franklin, survived his mother and was living when Helen\u2019s youngest child attained the age of 21 years, B. Franklin\u2019s interest in what may be called his mother\u2019s trust, became vested at that time. If he had died before Mrs. Hope\u2019s trustees had actually paid him his %th share of the principal of his mother\u2019s (Helen\u2019s) trust, his estate would of course have been entitled absolutely to %th of the principal of Helen\u2019s trust estate, and therefore of %th of Lillian\u2019s accrual share.\nThis interpretation of the language of Mrs. Hope\u2019s will is buttressed by the authorities relating to or governing vested and contingent interests. The law as to vested and contingent interests is well settled; at times it is difficult of application and sometimes it appears as if the eases were not entirely harmonious in their application of the rule. If resort be had to rules of construction, and this is done only when a testator\u2019s intent is not clear, B. Franklin, even though dead, acquired a vested interest in %th of Lillian\u2019s trust principal.\nIn Bald Estate, 385 Pa., supra, the Court further said: \u201c. ., . \u2018Moreover, if it is not clear from the language of the will whether the remainder is vested or contingent then as Mr. Justice Linn said in Weir\u2019s Estate, 307 Pa. 461, 468, 469, 161 A. 730, \u201cit is necessary to keep in mind the rule \u2018that an interest is to be construed contingent only when it is impossible to construe it as vested\u2019: Rau\u2019s Est., 254 Pa. 464, 98 Atl. 1068; that the intention to create a contingent interest \u2018should appear plainly, manifestly and indisputably\u2019: McCauley\u2019s Est., 257 Pa. 377, 101 Atl. 827 .... In Marshall\u2019s Est., supra, it is said: \u2018The law leans to vested rather than to contingent estates, and the presumption is that a legacy is vested: Carstensen\u2019s Est., 196 Pa. 325 [46 Atl. 495]; Tatham\u2019s Est., 250 Pa. 269 [95 Atl. 520]; Neel\u2019s Est., 252 Pa. 394 [97 Atl. 502]; Rau\u2019s Est. [supra]\nIn Newlin Estate, 367 Pa. 527, 80 A. 2d 819, the Court said (page 533) : \u201c . . If there is a present right to a future possession, though that right may be defeated by some future event, contingent or certain, there is nevertheless a vested estate\u2019: [McGlinn\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 389, 393, 182 A. 495]; McCauley\u2019s Estate, 257 Pa. 377, 382, 101 A. 827; Reed\u2019s Estate, 307 Pa. 482, 484, 161 A. 729.\u201d\nIn Rubicam\u2019s Estate, 48 Pa. D. & C. 486, Judge Hunter aptly said: \u201cWe construe this language to mean that the accruing shares shall pass to testator\u2019s other children and their issue subject to the same limitations as their original shares. If the original shares had vested in issue, then accruing shares also were vested. In other words, the intention of the testator was not to make new gifts to children and issue, subject to new conditions and contingencies, but merely to augment or enlarge the original gifts. See McGlinn\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 389.\u201d\nAppellants contend that B. Franklin\u2019s executor is not entitled to a y^tk interest or to any interest in the principal of Lillian Walls\u2019 trust, for three reasons: (1) The Pay and Divide Rule shows that the gifts to the grandchildren were contingent; (2) Mrs. Hope desired and intended the trusts which she created to be paid only to her nieces and their children and issue, since she expressly \u201cProvided, however that in no event shall any husband of my said niece receive any portion of my estate\u201d; and (3) That it would be anomalous, if not absurd, to hold that Mrs. Hope intended the estate of a grandnephew to share in her niece Lillian\u2019s trust principal, when the grandnephew died before Lillian. The answer to appellants\u2019 first point is two-fold: First, this Court abolished the Pay and Divide Rule in Dickson Estate, 396 Pa. 371, 374, 152 A. 2d 680; secondly, the Pay and Divide Rule, even if it were still in existence, would be inapplicable to the language of Mrs. Hope\u2019s will. Appellants\u2019 second and third points raise close questions of interpretation which can only be resolved by our construction of the meaning and intent of Mrs. Hope as expressed in the language of her entire will.\nWe believe that the Orphans\u2019 Court correctly interpreted Mrs. Hope\u2019s will.\nDecree affirmed; the parties to pay their respective costs.\nUnder the terms of a spendthrift trust.\nItalics throughout, ours."}
