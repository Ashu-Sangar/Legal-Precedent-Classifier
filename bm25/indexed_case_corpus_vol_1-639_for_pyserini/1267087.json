The owner had applied, not for a special exception or variance, but for permits on the ground that the application for the permits was in strict conformity with the Zoning Ordinance.\nThe decree is affirmed on the able and comprehensive opinion of President Judge Oliver. Costs shall be paid by appellants."}
