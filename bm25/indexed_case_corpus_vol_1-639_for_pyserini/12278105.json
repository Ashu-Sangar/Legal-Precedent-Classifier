{"id": "12278105", "contents": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nJUSTICE MUNDY\nThis case comes to us for a second time to determine if the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) is exempted from the jurisdiction of the City of Philadelphia (the City) via the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations (Philadelphia Commission) and the provisions of the Philadelphia Fair Practices Ordinance (FPO). We previously remanded this case to the Commonwealth Court to ascertain the legislative intent regarding this issue by employing the analysis set forth by this Court in Dep\u2019t of Gen. Servs. v. Ogontz Area Neighbors Ass\u2019n, 505 Pa. 614, 483 A.2d 448 (1984). See Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Auth. v. City of Philadelphia, et al., 627 Pa. 470, 101 A.3d 79, 90-91 (2014) (SEPTA III). On remand, the Commonwealth Court determined that, applying the Ogontz test, the language and statutory scheme of the relevant statutes revealed the legislature\u2019s intent to exempt SEPTA from actions brought under the FPO. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Auth. v. City of Philadelphia, et al., 122 A.3d 1163, 1173 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015) (SEPTA IV). For reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court.\nThis Court recounted the early procedural history of this case in our SEPTA III opinion, which we set forth again here.\nThis case has its origins in seven administrative proceedings against SEPTA that individuals instituted with the Philadelphia Commission from July 2007 through April 2009, alleging violations of the FPO.2 At least two of the administrative complaints included claims of types of discrimination against which the FPO offers protection, but that the Pennsylvania Human Relations Act (\u201cPHRA\u201d)3 does not cover. SEPTA filed a motion to dismiss each of the administrative cases for lack of jurisdiction, and the Philadelphia Commission denied the motions.\nWhile all seven administrative proceedings were still pending,[] SEPTA instituted this civil action against Appellants seeking both declaratory and injunctive relief. SEPTA maintained in its complaint[] that because it is a Commonwealth agency, and Appellants are a political subdivision and a municipal agency, respectively, the FPO does not apply to it, and the Pennsylvania Constitution barred Appellants from exercising jurisdiction over it.[]\nAppellants filed preliminary objections demurring to SEPTA\u2019S complaint. Appellants argued that because Philadelphia\u2019s powers under the First Class City Home Rule Act7 [ (FCCHRA) ] extend to enacting and enforcing anti-discrimination laws, the FPO applied to SEPTA and the Philadelphia Commission had jurisdiction over it. Appellants further contended that an original action for declaratory and injunctive relief was inappropriate because SEPTA had to await final agency decisions in the individual administrative cases against it before it could seek appellate review in court. In response, SEPTA pointed out that the statute authorizing the creation of metropolitan transportation authorities, such as SEPTA, provides that such an authority \u201cshall exercise the public powers of the Commonwealth as an agency and instrumentality thereof,\u201d 74 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1711(a), and asserted that Philadelphia\u2019s authority as a home-rule jurisdiction extends only to the regulation of its municipal affairs. In its brief in opposition to the preliminary objections, SEPTA did not rely upon, or refer to in any manner, the section of its enabling legislation pertaining to sovereign and official immunity. 74 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1711(c)(3). The trial court sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed SEPTA\u2019s complaint.[]\nSEPTA appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which reversed. SEPTA v. City of Philadelphia, 20 A.3d 558 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2011) (en banc) [ (Septa II) ]. A majority of the court concluded that the Philadelphia Commission lacked jurisdiction because SEPTA is an \u201cagency and instrumentality\u201d of the Commonwealth and therefore within the jurisdiction of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (the \u201cState Commission\u201d). The majority noted that the State Commission is responsible for the administration of the PHRA, which bans any \u201cemployer\u201d from engaging in certain forms of discrimination. 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 955, 956(a). Because the PHRA defines \u201cemployer\u201d as including \u201cthe Commonwealth or any political subdivision or board, department, commission or school district thereof,\u201d9 and because neither the PHRA nor the FPO explicitly grants the Philadelphia Commission jurisdiction over SEPTA, the majority concluded the State Commission\u2014and not the Philadelphia Commission\u2014had jurisdiction over SEPTA. The Commonwealth Court did not base any portion of its reasoning upon the section of SEPTA\u2019s enabling legislation pertaining to sovereign and official immunity. 74 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1711(c)(3). Because the majority considered the State Commission\u2019s jurisdiction over SEPTA to be clear, and a Commonwealth instrumentality\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe scope of a governmental body\u2019s action pursuant to statutory authority\u201d through a declaratory judgment action to be proper, the majority also concluded that SEPTA had no duty to exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking relief in court. SEPTA [II], supra at 563.\n[] Judge Dante Pellegrini dissented. He concluded that SEPTA is not a Commonwealth agency, and even if it were, it would still be subject to the provisions of the FPO and the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Commission. The dissent stated that the General Assembly had enacted the portion of SEPTA\u2019s enabling act that provides that a metropolitan transportation authority such as SEPTA is \u201can agency and instrumentality thereof\u2019 merely to avoid constitutional and statutory questions, such as limitations on local governments\u2019 acquisition of debt. 74 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1711(a). The dissent opined that the cited language was not intended to render SEPTA a state agency for all purposes.\nThe dissent then concluded that even if SEPTA were part of the Commonwealth government, it nonetheless would be subject to the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Commission under Commonwealth v. Ogontz Area Neighbors Association, 505 Pa. 614, 483 A.2d 448, 452 (1984). In that case, the Department of Public Welfare (\u201cDPW\u201d)\u2014which we characterized as \u201can agency of the Commonwealth\u201d\u2014applied to the City of Philadelphia for the permits needed to build a facility for the mentally handicapped. Id. at 449-50. The City denied the permits on the ground that the proposed facility did not comply with use and other restrictions under the Philadelphia Zoning Code. On review in this Court, we rejected the notion that DPW was immune from local land regulations because it had the power to condemn property to establish the facility it sought to construct. We reasoned that because the General Assembly had established both the City and DPW, and had fixed the extent of each entity\u2019s powers, we would need to examine the enabling act of each entity to determine which entity\u2019s authority the legislature had intended to prevail for purposes of the parties\u2019 controversy. Because the applicable statutes did not clearly state which entity the legislature had intended to be \u201cpreeminent,\u201d we applied the rule of statutory construction that a court may determine legislative intent by considering \u201cthe consequences of a particular interpretation.\u201d Id. at 455 (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(6)). Because Philadelphia\u2019s zoning scheme would have been frustrated if DPW were to have prevailed, while subjecting DPW to local zoning rules and restrictions would not necessarily have frustrated DPW\u2019s mandate to establish mental health facilities, we concluded that the legislature had intended the City to have priority in the circumstances at issue.\nThe dissent here applied the principles we set forth in Ogontz and concluded that, as in Ogontz, the relevant statutes were ambiguous as to which entity was intended to have priority. The dissent therefore considered the effect of holding each entity preeminent and determined that ruling in SEPTA\u2019s favor would frustrate the legislature\u2019s intended scheme. Characterizing the PHRA as granting the State and Philadelphia Commissions\u2019 \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction,\u201d the dissent explained that deeming SEPTA \u201cpreeminent\u201d over Appellants would thwart the legislatively established system of shared jurisdiction. The dissent explained that, on the other hand, treating Appellants as \u201cpreeminent\u201d would not interfere with SEPTA\u2019s purpose of providing public transportation. The dissent stated, \u201cAll the consequence of the City\u2019s and the [State Commission\u2019s] preeminence means is that SEPTA would still have to respond to complaints, like private companies, of those choosing to file their claims of unlawful discrimination with [the Philadelphia Commission].\u201d SEPTA [III], supra at 569 (Pellegrini, J., dissenting).\n2 In general terms, the FPO protects against discrimination: in employment based upon a person\u2019s race, ethnicity, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, disability, marital status, familial status, genetic information, or domestic or sexual violence victim status; in public accommodations based upon race, ethnicity, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, marital status, familial status, or domestic or sexual violence victim status; and in housing accommodation, commercial property and other real estate opportunities based upon race, ethnicity, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, ancestry, disability, marital status, age, source of income, familial status, or domestic or sexual violence victim status. Phila. Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-1103,1106,1108.\n3 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 951-963. The PHRA protects most, but not all, of the categories of individuals covered by the FPO. In general terms, the PHRA protects against discrimination in employment, housing, and public accommodation because of race, color, familial status, religious creed, ancestry, handicap or disability, age, sex, and national origin. In addition, it prohibits discrimination based upon the use of a guide or support animal because of the blindness, deafness or physical handicap of the user or because the user is a handler or trainer of support or guide animals.\n7 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13101-13157.\n9 43 P.S. \u00a7 954.\nSEPTA III, 101 A.3d at 82-84 (some citations and footnotes omitted).\nIn reviewing the Commonwealth Court\u2019s SEPTA II decision, we held that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s reliance on the status of SEPTA as a Commonwealth agency, was not disposi-tive of the issue of preemption. Citing Ogontz, County of Venango v. Borough of Sugarcreek, 534 Pa. 1, 626 A.2d 489, 490 (1993), and Hazleton Area Sch. Dist. v. Zoning Hearing Bd., 566 Pa. 180, 778 A.2d 1205, 1210 (2001), we explained that a governmental entity, that derives its existence from the legislature, does not possess inherently superior powers over another such legislatively created entity by virtue of its type or the entity\u2019s respective designation as \u201cCommonwealth\u201d or \u201cmunicipal.\u201d SEPTA III at 87. Rather, the question must be resolved through an inquiry into the legislative intent as revealed by the pertinent enabling legislation. Thus, we rejected SEPTA\u2019s structure-based argument that for a Municipal Authority to exercise jurisdiction over a Commonwealth agency, it was necessary for the legislature to expressly so provide. Id. at 87-88. We similarly rejected the Appellants\u2019 argument that the presumed validity afforded Home Rule enactments resolved the issue of legislative intent. Id. at 88. We, therefore, held that the Commonwealth Court should have pursued an inquiry into the legislative intent in accordance with the stepped analysis first enunciated in Ogontz.\nAs identified in Hazleton, our opinion in Ogontz, supra sets forth the analytical process a court is to follow to determine which entity the legislature intended to have preeminent powers over a given area of regulation.\nThe first step requires the reviewing court to determine, through examination of the statutes, which governmental entity, if any, the General Assembly expressly intended to be preeminent. Id In the event there is no such express legislative mandate, the second step requires the court \u201cto determine legislative intent as to which agency is to prevail .... turning] to the statutory construction rule that legislative intent may be determined by a consideration, inter alia, of the consequences of a particular interpretation.\u201d\nHazleton, supra at 1210 (quoting Ogontz, supra at 455 (citing in turn 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(6))) (emphasis omitted).\nId. at 87. In essence, we rejected the Commonwealth Court\u2019s status-based analysis and remanded for it to ascertain the legislative intent by applying the Ogontz test to the entities\u2019 respective enabling legislation. Id.\nOn remand, a majority of the Commonwealth Court sitting en banc addressed the first prong of the Ogontz test, which it phrased as \u201cdetermin[ing] whether one legislative scheme was intended to have priority over the other.\u201d SEPTA IV, 122 A.3d at 1168. Looking at the respective legislative schemes, the Majority noted the Metropolitan Transportation Authorities Act (MTAA) established that SEPTA is a Commonwealth agency and instrumentality. Id. at 1169. (quoting 74 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1711(a)). It further noted the MTAA afforded SEPTA sovereign and official immunity. Id. at 1169-70 (quoting 74 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1711(c)). The Majority observed that 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2310 provides that agencies with sovereign immunity may only be sued \u201cwhere the legislature has expressly waived immunity.\u201d Id. at 1170 (quoting Ebersole v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transp. Auth., 111 A.3d 286, 289 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2015) (emphasis added in SEPTA IV)). The Commonwealth Court then reviewed the PHRA, which expressly waives immunity of Commonwealth agencies from actions initiated under it. Id. (citing 43 P.S. \u00a7 954). In contrast, the Majority concluded the FCCHRA, which is the source for the City\u2019s authority to enact the FPO, does not contain an express waiver of the immunity accorded to Commonwealth agencies. Id. at 1171. The Majority explained that the FPO authorizes private claims, including potential awards for compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorney fees. Id., (citing PHILA. CODE \u00a7\u00a7 9-1105, 9-1107). It, therefore, distinguished the provisions of the FPO from the land use and traffic regulation enforcement disputes that were the subjects of earlier cases. Id. at 1171-1172. \u201cThe penalties authorized by the [FPO] require an express waiver of sovereign immunity, and none has been expressed by the General Assembly.\u201d Id. at 1172.\nThe Majority rejected the City\u2019s argument that Section 12 of the PHRA accomplishes a waiver of sovereign immunity relative to the FPO. It noted that the legislature waived SEPTA\u2019s immunity only as to the jurisdiction of the State Commission, and that such waivers are to be narrowly construed. Id., at 1172-73 (citing Dean v. Dept. of Transp., 561 Pa. 503, 751 A.2d 1130, 1134 (2000)).\nJudge Pellegrini filed a dissent in which he argued an interpretation of the statutory language as revealing the intent of the legislature to subject SEPTA to the jurisdiction of the FPO. Id. at 1176 (Pellegrini, J. dissenting). Judge Pellegrini argued that the designation of SEPTA as a Commonwealth agency does not afford it equivalency with the Commonwealth for all purposes, citing eases holding SEPTA\u2019s status as a Commonwealth agency is related to the reasons for its creation. Id. at 1177. He notes SEPTA is an \u201cauthority\u201d tasked with providing a commercial service. Id. He noted the subject matter in question here, anti-discrimination enforcement, is removed from SEPTA\u2019s fundamental transportation function. That is, SEPTA provides a service, not the governing function that appertains to municipalities. Id. Judge Pellegrini viewed the authority afforded the City through the FCCHRA, and section 12 of the PHRA, which permits local governments to concurrently promulgate and enforce anti-discrimination ordinances, as revealing a statutory scheme where the City predominates over SEPTA in the arena of enforcing anti-discrimination laws. Id. at 1183. He concluded \u201c[tjhere is nothing in the legislative scheme that would suggest that SEPTA\u2019s interests should predominate over the Commonwealth\u2019s; everything suggests [the City\u2019s] governmental interest predominates.\u201d Id. at 1179. Judge Pellegrini also argued that, to the extent SEPTA may be protected by sovereign immunity, such was limited to monetary damages but does not extend to other forms of relief the Philadelphia Commission has at its disposal. Id. at 1182.\nAppellants contend that, in SEPTA III, this Court resolved the first prong of the Ogontz test in their favor, and that the Commonwealth Court erred in ignoring that holding. Appellants\u2019 Brief at 24. Appellants argue that the Commonwealth Court Majority \u201crevives the very presumption in favor of SEPTA that this Court directed that it avoid.\u201d Id. at 25. In line with its arguments in the prior appeal, Appellants emphasize that the FCCHRA grants the City authority to legislate for its municipal functions as fully as could the Commonwealth\u2019s legislature, absent an explicit or implicit preemption by the General Assembly. Id., (citing Warren v. City of Philadelphia, 382 Pa. 380, 115 A.2d 218, 221 (1955)). This includes the authority to enact the FPO. Id. at 26 (citing Devlin v. City of Philadelphia, 580 Pa. 564, 862 A.2d 1234 (2004)). Appellants also rely on the provisions and history of the PHRA, which contemplates concurrent, and perhaps more stringent, local regulation and enforcement in the anti-discrimination arena. Id. at 27. Additionally, Appellants reference the presumptive validity of a municipality\u2019s enactments under the Home Rule powers. Id. at 28. Appellants assert that the FCCHRA contains no indication that SEPTA should be excluded from the purview of the Philadelphia Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.\nAppellants dispute the Commonwealth Court Majority\u2019s conclusion that the language and statutory scheme of the MTAA evinces an intent that SEPTA is excluded from the jurisdiction of the Philadelphia Commission and the FPO. Appellants assert that the MTAA\u2019s provisions conferring sovereign immunity upon SEPTA \u201cdo[ ] not speak to the authority of a municipality to enforce validly-enacted and generally applicable local anti-discrimination legislation against SEPTA,\u201d or to legislative intent on the issue. Id. at 31. Appellants claim the Commonwealth Court\u2019s reasoning adopts the rationale in Chief Justice Castille\u2019s dissent, which they assert we rejected in SEPTA III. Id. at 31-32. Appellants argue that relying upon the grant of sovereign immunity in this instance essentially resurrects the presumption and status-based approach favoring Commonwealth agencies that this Court disapproved. Appellants note that the fact SEPTA enjoyed sovereign immunity was not dispositive in Ogontz, where we held SEPTA was not exempt from the City\u2019s enforcement of its zoning regulations. Id. at 33-34.\nAppellants next argue that the fact that the legislature expressly waived SEPTA\u2019s immunity in the PHRA is unavailing to SEPTA because legislative intent as to priority is not discerned by a determination of whether or not a third entity has a role to play, and because the scope of protections afforded by the FPO are greater than those afforded by the PHRA. Id. at 34-35. Finally, Appellants suggest that, to the extent SEPTA\u2019s sovereign immunity acts as a bar to enforcement of the FPO against it, it does not implicate all of the enforcement tools available to the Philadelphia Commission. Id. at 37. Sovereign immunity, they point out, has been held to pertain to awards of monetary damages, but not other forms of equitable and declaratory relief. Id. at 38-39. \u201cTo argue, based on sovereign immunity, that the General Assembly has expressly abrogated all of the [Philadelphia] Commission\u2019s jurisdiction, ignores that the bulk of the [Philadelphia] Commission\u2019s work is essentially investigatory and administrative.\u201d Id. at 40.\nThe State Commission filed an amicus brief in support of Appellants. It advances the argument that the PHRA expressly provides for concurrent jurisdiction and liberal construction. The State Commission\u2019s Amicus Brief at 2. It argues SEPTA meets the definition of a local employer under the PHRA and notes that cases favor \u201crobust\u201d application of anti-discrimination laws. Id. at 4-5. The State Commission argues that its interpretation of the PHRA is entitled to deference as the agency charged with implementing the statute. Id. at 6-7 (citing Office of Admin. v. Pa. Labor Rels. Bd., 591 Pa. 176, 916 A.2d 541, 549 (2007)).\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania (ACLU) and the Mazzoni Center Legal Services (Mazzoni Center) filed a joint Amicus brief. They reiterate the provisions of the PHRA allowing local ordinances to provide concurrent and greater enforcement. ACLU and Mazzoni Center\u2019s Amicus Brief at 22-23. They note that the PHRA and the FCCHRA predate the MTAA which created SEPTA. They argue the enactment of the MTAA did not alter the dual jurisdiction paradigm. Id. at 24. They further argue the MTAA did not meet the criteria under the Statutory Construction Act for repealing those earlier enactments, because it did not constitute a revision of all statutes on a subject, or purport to establish a uniform and mandatory system over the subject matter at issue. Id. at 25-26.\nSEPTA refutes Appellants\u2019 argument that the Commonwealth Court Majority did not properly apply the Ogontz test to the pertinent statutes in this case. SEPTA\u2019s Brief at 10. It argues that the Commonwealth Court did not resurrect a status-based priority of SEPTA over the City. Rather, it asserts the Commonwealth Court focused on the intent of the legislature relative to the City\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over SEPTA. Id. at 10-11. SEPTA counters Appellants\u2019 assertion that the broad powers afforded the City under the FCCHRA support an inference of the legislative intent respecting preemption. SEPTA argues it ignores our holding in SEPTA III, where we stated the presumption of validity is relevant to the authority to act, and not \u201cwhether the municipality may enforce ordinances and regulations against a Commonwealth agency or instrumentality.\u201d Id. at 16 (quoting SEPTA III, 101 A.3d at 88). SEPTA argues that the MTAA plainly establishes that SEPTA is afforded sovereign immunity. Id at 18. It notes such immunity must be expressly waived to permit suits against it. Id. at 19 (citing Powell v. Drumheller, 539 Pa. 484, 653 A.2d 619, 621 (1995); Tork-Hiis v. Com., 558 Pa. 170, 735 A.2d 1256, 1258 (1999)). SEPTA notes such a specific waiver is present in the PHRA, but not in the FCCHRA. Id. at 20.\nSEPTA argues that, contrary to Appellants\u2019 assertions, the Commonwealth Court did view the Ogontz test \u201cthrough the lens of the specific municipal ordinance... sought to be enforced,\u201d and did not hold that sovereign immunity creates a per se exemption from all municipal jurisdiction. Id. at 21-22. Thus, SEPTA asserts the distinction drawn by the Commonwealth Court between the land use issues, applicable in Ogontz, and the regulations present in the FPO, which include rights of private action and the award of damages, is valid. Id. at 24-25. SEPTA argues Appellants\u2019 parsing of the potential enforcement remedies available under the FPO to support an inference of legislative intent to permit the Philadelphia Commission\u2019s partial jurisdiction over it is inapposite. Id. at 33-34.\nAppellants sought allowance of appeal, which we granted for decision on the following question, as framed by Appellants:\nDid the General Assembly, when it gave Philadelphia general police powers as expansive as [those] of the General Assembly and specific authority to enact local anti-discrimination laws, intend to exempt SEPTA from compliance with those laws, when the consequence of compliance would not materially disrupt SEPTA\u2019s core transportation function and the consequence of non-compliance would leave hundreds of thousands of Philadelphia passengers and employees without a remedy against many forms of discrimination?\nSEPTA v. City of Phila., 635 Pa. 194, 133 A.3d 292 (2016).\nA.\nInitially, we address Appellants\u2019 assertion that this Court essentially resolved the first prong of the Ogontz test prior to our remand to the Commonwealth Court in SEPTA III. That assertion is mistaken. Ogontz is implicated when a question arises as to legislative intent respecting competing interests between distinct entities created by the legislature. In SEPTA III, we held SEPTA was \u201cwrong in asserting that, in order for a local governmental agency to prevail over a Commonwealth agency or instrumentality, the legislature must have clearly stated its intent in that regard.\u201d SEPTA III, 101 A.3d at 87. Rather, we explained \u201cwe have applied the Statutory Construction Act in order to discern the legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d Id. We further held that SEPTA\u2019s status-based argument and the City\u2019s reliance on the presumptive validity of homerule enactments did not provide such an express directive. Id. at 88. Therefore, we held that it was incumbent upon the Commonwealth Court to apply the two-part test set forth in Ogontz. Id. at 90. The first prong of that analysis requires an examination of the overall language of the legislation to discern if the General Assembly expressly intended one or the other to be preeminent. Ogontz, 483 A.2d at 455. While it is undisputed that neither enabling statute contained an explicit provision directly addressing the issue, that fact did not preclude the possibility that an examination of the statutes as a whole would reveal such a clear intent. Our holding merely recognized that the Commonwealth Court in SEPTA II did not perform a review to discern the legislature\u2019s intent because it relied on the status of SEPTA as a Commonwealth agency, treating the competing entities in a hierarchical manner. SEPTA III, 101 A.3d at 87. We also noted that, as of the time of the appeal in SEPTA III, SEPTA had not relied on the sovereign immunity provisions and the Commonwealth Court did not base any of its reasoning thereon. Id. at 83. Accordingly, we did not determine the first prong of the Ogontz analysis, and the Commonwealth Court, on remand, correctly engaged in an independent review of the enabling statutes to determine if the relevant legislative intent was therein expressed.\nB.\nWe next address Appellants\u2019 arguments that are reflected in Judge Pellegrini\u2019s dissent. Appellants adopt an approach that focuses on the core functions of the respective entities. This reliance on the core functions of SEPTA and the City, and Judge Pellegrini\u2019s distinction between an \u201cauthority\u201d providing a service and a municipality with governing authority, essentially turns the status-based analysis of the Commonwealth Court in SEPTA II on its head. Instead of prioritizing Commonwealth agencies over municipalities absent an express contrary intent by the legislature, Appellants would prioritize based on the governing versus the service-providing function of the respective entities. This is merely a different version of the status-based approach we rejected in SEPTA III. \u201cIn a series of cases beginning with our decision in Ogontz, supra, this Court has held that a Commonwealth agency\u2019s challenge to a municipality\u2019s exercise of authority over it does not represent a contest between superior and inferior governmental entities, but instead a contest between two instrumentalities of the state.\u201d Id. at 87 (quoting Ogontz, 483 A.2d at 452) (other citations omitted). The considerations reflected in Appellants\u2019 arguments may be relevant in the performance of the second part of the Ogontz analysis, if necessary, but are not indicative of the legislature\u2019s intent in the first part, which focuses on the language of the pertinent statutes. See id.\nC.\nWe turn then, to our de novo review of the authorizing statutes to discern if the legislature has expressed an intent to exempt SEPTA from enforcement of the FPO. Reviewing the legislation establishing the City\u2019s authority under Home Rule and the legislation creating SEPTA, we note several facts are undisputed. Respecting SEPTA, it is clear the MTAA provides that SEPTA exercises its public powers as an agency of the Commonwealth. 74 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1711(a). It is equally undisputed that the MTAA extends sovereign immunity to SEPTA. Id. at \u00a7 1711(c) (referencing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2810, which states that sovereign immunity continues until \u201cspecifically waived\u201d by the General Assembly); see also Frazier v. W.C.A.B. (Bayada Nurses, Inc.), 616 Pa. 592, 52 A.3d 241 (2012) (holding subro-gation claim against SEPTA under the Workers Compensation Act was barred on the basis of sovereign immunity).\nThe authority of the City to enact the FPO and to enforce its provisions within Philadelphia is also not contested. That authority stems from the FCCHRA, which grants broad powers to the City to legislate in any non-prohibited field pertinent to its municipal functions. See 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 13101-13157. Additionally, the PHRA specifically provides that its provisions do not interfere with the authority of a municipality to pass appropriate ordinances and enforce anti-discrimination provisions concurrently with the State Commission. See 43 P.S. \u00a7 962(a), (b).\nAs recognized by the Commonwealth Court majority, these clear provisions show the legislature intended to shield SEPTA from entities initiating suits against it. The general authority of the City to legislate in this area, simply does not address the issue of its jurisdiction over SEPTA. In contrast, the sovereign immunity provisions do create an express limitation on any entity in bringing suit against SEPTA. We recognize that the legislature specifically waived sovereign immunity for Commonwealth agencies for purposes of enforcement of the PHRA. 43 P.S. \u00a7 954. It does not follow that the waiver of immunity piggybacks to the FPO merely because local municipalities are permitted to exercise concurrent enactment and enforcement authority with the State Commission with respect to the subject matter at issue. Rather, Section 954 is an explicit expression of the legislature\u2019s intent to grant the State Commission exclusive jurisdiction over Commonwealth agencies in anti-discrimination matters. As noted above, any waiver of sovereign immunity must be specifically enacted by the legislature. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2310. No such waiver appears in the City\u2019s Home Rule authorization or SEPTA\u2019s enabling legislation. The fact that the FPO has an array of enforcement options does not provide a basis to infer the legislature intended only a partial exemption. As SEPTA suggests, this would require a selective reading of the FPO.\nIn conclusion, the Commonwealth Court did not err in its determination that, under the first prong of the Ogontz analysis, the statutory language and legislative scheme of the enabling legislation disclosed the legislature\u2019s intent to exclude SEPTA from the jurisdiction of the FPO. We, therefore, affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.\nChief Justice Saylor and Justice Baer join the opinion.\nChief Justice Saylor and Justice Wecht file concurring opinions.\nJustice Donohue files a dissenting opinion in which Justices Todd and Dougherty joins.\n. Chief Justice Castille and Justice Ealdn filed concurring and dissenting opinions expressing the view that Ogontz should not have applicability beyond the land use and zoning issues involved therein. SEPTA III, 101 A.3d at 92-93 (Castille, C.J. concurring and dissenting); let at 97 (Ealdn, J, concurring and dissenting). Chief Justice Castille opined that the Commonwealth Court sufficiently reviewed the relevant statutory language and properly concluded it precluded enforcement of the FPO against SEPTA, \"No remand to assess legislative intent is called for in this matter because the Commonwealth Court appropriately ascertained and effectuated the General Assembly's intent by looldng to, and applying, the plain language of the relevant statutory provisions.\u201d Id. at 95; accord Id. at 98 (Saylor, J. dissenting).\n. The relevant section provides as follows.\n(a) The provisions of this act shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof, and any law inconsistent with any provisions hereof shall not apply.\n(b) Except as provided in subsection (c), nothing contained in this act shall be deemed to repeal or supersede any of the provisions of any existing or hereafter adopted municipal ordinance, municipal charter or of any law of this Commonwealth relating to discrimination because of race, color, familial status, religious creed, ancestry, age, sex, national origin or handicap or disability!.] \u2022 \u2022. In the event of a conflict between the interpretation of a provision of this act and the interpretation of a similar provision contained in any municipal ordinance, the interpretation of the provision in this act shall apply to such municipal ordinance.\n43 P.S. \u00a7 962(a), (b).\n. Acknowledging in light of its holding that it was unnecessary to reach the issue, the Commonwealth Court Majority also proceeded to determine that under the second prong of the Ogontz test a review of the consequences of the competing interpretations of the statutes favored the same conclusion relative to the legislature\u2019s intent. SEPTA IV, 122 A.3d at 1175.\n. Judge Simpson authored a separate dissent declaring his view that the matter should be remanded to develop a record about the effects enforcement of the FPO would have on SEPTA\u2019s ability to attend to its core functions. SEPTA IV, 122 A.3d at 1185 (Simpson, J, dissenting). Judge Pellegrini agreed that the record was underdeveloped and would also remand. He further expressed his reasons why he deems the Majority's conclusion, that the impact of such enforcement would be daunting, to be \"specious.\u201d Id. at 1183. Because we agree that, under the first prong of the Ogontz test, the legislative scheme reveals an intent to shield SEPTA from the FPO, we do not reach, and express no opinion about, the impact on the respective entities of enforcement or non-enforcement under the second part of the Ogontz test,\n. Appellants cite the following cases in support of this contention.\nSee Legal Capital, LLC. v. Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss Fund, 561 Pa. 336, 750 A.2d 299, 302-03 (2000) (sovereign immunity did not bar action seeking equitable relief or a declaratory judgment that plaintiff\u2019s assignee was entitled to direct payments from the Medical Professional Liability Catastrophe Loss Fund, a Commonwealth executive agency); Wilkinsburg Police Officers Ass'n By and Through Harder v. Com., 535 Pa. 425, 636 A.2d 134, 137 (1993) (\u201csuits which simply seek to restrain state officials from performing affirmative acts are not within the rule of immunity\u2019\u2019); Fawber v. Cohen, 516 Pa. 352, 532 A.2d 429, 433-34 (1987) (\"suits which ... seek to restrain state officials from performing affirmative acts are not within the rule of [sovereign] immunity\"\u2014thus, action, which seeks to restrain the Secretary of Welfare and declare his regulations invalid, is not an action for which the Secretary enjoys sovereign immunity); Finn v. Rendell, 990 A.2d 100, 105 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2010) (\"sovereign immunily does not bar a declaratory judgment action or injunction seeking to prohibit state parties, i.e., state agencies or employees, from acting\u201d); Stackhouse v. Com., Pennsylvania State Police, 892 A.2d 54, 59-60 n.6, 61 (Pa. Cmwlth. 2006) (\u201csovereign immunity [does not] bar[] claims... seeking prohibitory injunctions to restrain state action\u201d or \"a mandamus action to compel an agency or officer to perform a ministerial or mandatory statutory duty\u201d); McGriff v. Com., Pennsylvania Bd. of Probation and Parole, 127 Pa.Cmwlth. 167, 561 A.2d 78, 80 (1989) (sovereign immunity was not a proper defense to parolee\u2019s mandamus petition seeking to compel Board of Probation and Parole to vacate its recommitment order after parolee's original sentence had been vacated).\nAppellants\u2019 Brief at 37-38.\n. Again, in light of our disposition, we do not address the Amici\u2019s arguments related to the second prong of the Ogontz test.\n. As in our earlier review of this case, the issue before us is one of statutory interpretation. \u201cOur standard of review of such a question of statutory inteipretation is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary.\u201d SEPTA III, 101 A.3d at 87 (citing Hazleton, 778 A.2d at 1213).\n. Similarly, contrary to Appellants\u2019 assertions, the SEPTA III majority did not reject Chief Justice Castille\u2019s analysis of the legislative intent. His position that Ogontz should not apply beyond its facts was not agreed to by the majority, but the majority did not reach or opine on whether or not legislative intent was clear in the language of the statutes. The Court instead remanded for the Commonwealth Court to address the issue in the first instance, under the proper standard. As such, at most, the majority position was that Chief Justice Castille\u2019s analysis was premature. See SEPTA III, 101 A.3d at 87-88.\n. Our holding does not do harm to our deference to the State Commission in matters of statutory interpretation under its purview. First, such deference must give way to clear language of the legislature. Com., Office of Admin. v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Bd., 591 Pa. 176, 916 A.2d 541, 550 (2007). Second, the source of the statutory language evidence the General Assembly\u2019s intent on this issue stems from the MTAA, over which the PHRA has no interpretive function."}
