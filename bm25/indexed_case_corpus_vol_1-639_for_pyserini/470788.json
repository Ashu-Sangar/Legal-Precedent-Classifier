{"id": "470788", "contents": "OPINION\nMONTEMURO, Justice.\nThis case is about whether, in a workmen\u2019s compensation reinstatement hearing, an employer\u2019s burden of showing job availability is met by a showing that the job is within claimant\u2019s work-related medical restrictions solely. We granted allocatur, as it is a matter of first impression, to determine whether an employer is required to take into consideration pre-existing medical restrictions which are unrelated to claimant\u2019s work injury, in meeting its burden of proof on job availability. Because the Commonwealth Court correctly decided this issue, we affirm.\nThe parties stipulated to the relevant facts of this matter.\n1. The Claimant, Terry L. Markle, suffered a work-related back injury on September 13, 1988, while working for Defendant Caterpillar Tractor Company.\n2. On or about February 1, 1989, the Claimant was released to restricted duty and returned to work without loss of earning power and a Supplemental Agreement suspending compensation was signed.\n3. On or about January 29, 1990, Defendant transferred the Claimant to the position of shop helper in its manufacturing department. The position was within the Claimant\u2019s work-related restrictions.\n4. The Claimant suffers from severe pulmonary emphysema and must avoid certain irritants as set forth in Dr. Richard L. Keeports, M.D.\u2019s report dated January 23, 1990. Dr. Keeports\u2019 report is attached to this Stipulation and incorporated herein.\n5. The Claimant\u2019s pulmonary emphysema is not a work-related injury.\n6. Because of his severe pulmonary emphysema, the Claimant is unable to perform the duties of shop helper in the manufacturing department, where he may be exposed to irritants that he is to avoid.\n7. The report of Claimant\u2019s treating orthopedic physician, J. Joseph Danyo, M.D., concerning Claimant\u2019s work related restrictions are attached to this Stipulation and incorporated herein.\n8. Both the position held by the Claimant prior to January 29,1990 in the warehouse, and the shop helper position paid wages equal to claimant\u2019s pre-injury average weekly wage.\nStipulation of Facts, 8/20/90.\nClaimant refused the transfer offered by Caterpillar and filed for reinstatement of Workmen\u2019s Compensation. Before the referee, only two issues were disputed: (1) the reason for the transfer, and (2) whether Caterpillar was aware of claimant\u2019s emphysema at the time the employer proposed to transfer claimant.\nThe referee found that the employer had transferred claimant because the warehouse position was declared surplus, and claimant was transferred to the shop helper position in the manufacturing department on the basis of seniority. Markle v. Caterpillar Tractor Company, Referee\u2019s Decision 2/12/91, Finding of Fact No. 6. The referee did not make a specific finding as to whether employer was aware of claimant\u2019s emphysema at the time of transfer, nor did the referee make a specific finding as to whether claimant\u2019s emphysema preexisted his work-related injury. Instead, the referee found that a \u201cposition has been made available to the Claimant within his work-related restrictions.\u201d Id. Finding of Fact No. 5.\nThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Board) affirmed on the basis of Farquhar v. W.C.A.B. (Coming Glass), 515 Pa. 315, 528 A.2d 580 (1987); Jasper v. W.C.A.B. and Teledyne, etc., 498 Pa. 263, 445 A.2d 1212 (1982); and Lash v. W.C.A.B. and General Battery Corp., 491 Pa. 294, 420 A.2d 1325 (1980). The Board reasoned that when an employer asserts that a claimant is able to return to his former job, but the medical evidence indicates that the claimant cannot return without risk of further physical harm, the employer will not meet its medical burden of proof \u2014 unless the risk of further harm is unrelated to the compensable injury.\nClaimant next appealed to the Commonwealth Court. In an unpublished Memorandum Opinion, that court affirmed the Board relying on Section 413 (a) of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and its recent holding in Carpentertown Coal & Coke Co. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Seybert), 154 Pa.Commw. 408, 623 A.2d 955 (1993), appeal denied, 535 Pa. 640, 631 A.2d 1011 (1993). Markle v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Caterpillar Tractor Company), No. 1130 C.D. 1992 (Pa.Commw. June 10, 1993) (Kelley, J., dissenting).\nClaimant filed a petition for allowance of appeal with this Court, which we granted on February 28, 1994. Markle v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, (Caterpillar Tractor Co.), 537 Pa. 614, 641 A.2d 313 (1994). Oral argument was heard on December 7, 1994.\nOur scope of review in a worker\u2019s compensation matter is limited to a determination of whether there has been a constitutional violation, an error of law, or a violation of Appeal Board procedure, and whether necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence. St. Joe Container Co. v. W.C.AB. (Staroschuck), 534 Pa. 347, 633 A.2d 128 (1993).\nWorker\u2019s Compensation can best be understood as a replacement of common law tort actions between employees and employers as a means for obtaining compensation for injuries. Kachinski v. W.C.AB. (Vepco Construction Co.), 516 Pa. 240, 532 A.2d 374 (1987). A worker\u2019s compensation claimant may only collect for those injuries arising out of his employment. Id. In addition, a claimant\u2019s benefits are tied to his wage at the time of the injury. Id.\nA claimant seeking reinstatement following a suspension of benefits must prove that the reasons for the suspension no longer exist. First, Markle must prove that through no fault of his own, his earning power is again adversely affected by his disability. Second, he must prove that the original disability continues. Pieper v. Ametek-Thermox Instruments Division, 526 Pa. 25, 34, 584 A.2d 301, 305 (1990). Once an employee has sustained his burden of proving that he is disabled from performing the duties of his pre-injury position of employment as a result of a work related injury, the employer has the burden of proving that other work is available to the injured employee which he is capable of obtaining and performing.\nIn this matter there is no dispute that Markle\u2019s work related disability continued as of the date of his layoff in January, 1990. Moreover, there is no dispute that through no fault of his own, claimant\u2019s earning power is once again adversely affected by his disability. Accordingly, the burden of proof shifted to Caterpillar to prove job availability at the time of Markle\u2019s lay off.\nWe find that the determination that Caterpillar met this burden is supported by substantial evidence and affirm. A position may be found to be actually available only if it can be performed by the claimant with regard to his \u201cphysical restrictions and limitations, his age, his intellectual capacity, his education, his previous work experience, and other relevant considerations.\u201d Kachinski v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Vepco Construction Co.), 516 Pa. 240, 251, 532 A.2d 374, 379 (1987). The referrals by the employer must be made in good faith. Id. at 252, 532 A.2d at 380. The referrals must be an attempt to return the injured employee to productive employment and not an effort to avoid paying compensation. Id.\nIn Titusville Hospital v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board (Ward), 122 Pa.Commw. 619, 552 A.2d 365 (1989), the Commonwealth Court relied upon Kachinski and held that a claimant\u2019s physical limitations are a factor to be considered when determining whether work was available. Titusville, 122 Pa.Commw. at 621, 552 A.2d at 366. In Sheehan v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Supermarkets General), 143 Pa.Commw. 624, 600 A.2d 633 (1991), appeal denied, 530 Pa. 663, 609 A.2d 170 (1992), the court explained that when the referee considers physical limitations to determine job availability, physical limitations cannot be construed to include those physical limitations resulting from a non-work related injury with no casual connection to the prior work-related injury. Sheehan, 143 Pa.Commw. at 632, 600 A.2d at 637. Moreover, the court cannot consider physical limitations which are existing prior to the injury. Id. To do so, would require the employer to compensate an employee for non-job related injuries during the period that the employee is recovering from his or her work-related injury. Id.\nClearly, claimants emphysema did not result from his work related injury. There was uncontradicted evidence before the referee regarding claimant\u2019s emphysema. Claimant testified that he had initially been diagnosed with the condition in 1984. Moreover, there is a reference to claimant\u2019s emphysema in a 1987 Caterpillar Interval Medical History. Claimant\u2019s emphysema is not a physical limitation which the referee must consider when making a determination about job availability. See USX Corp. v. W.C.A.B. (Hems), 167 Pa.Commw. 19, 647 A.2d 605 (1994) (employer was not required to show job availability where claimant was unable to resume employment because of nonwork-related brain abscess rather than work-related thumb injury); Carpentertown Coal & Coke v. W.C.A.B. (Seybert), 154 Pa.Commw. 408, 623 A.2d 955 (1993), appeal denied, 535 Pa. 640, 631 A.2d 1011 (1993) (employer was entitled to suspension of benefits, even though claimant had suffered permanent damage to heart muscle as a result of a work-related myocardial infarction, where inability to return to pre-injury job was not caused by damage to heart, but rather was caused by preexisting coronary disease).\nClaimant raises an number of examples illustrating how the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding in this matter could be abused. For instance: Employee A is confined to a wheelchair at the time of hiring by Employer B. Employee A then suffers a work related injury resulting in an inability to use one of his arms to the degree that he is disabled from performing the duties of his pre-injury position of employment. Employer B offers Employee A position which only requires the use of his uninjured arm, but which requires him to stand, walk, and climb ladders. Employee A could perform the duties of that position given his work related limitations, but clearly he could not perform the duties of that offered position because of his preexisting, non-work related medical condition. While this example offered by the claimant is compelling, Employer B\u2019s actions in the example would not have been in good faith; thus violating the requirement set out in Kachinski v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Vepco Construction Co.), 516 Pa. 240, 532 A.2d 374 (1987) (the referrals by the employer must be made in good faith, they must be an attempt to return the injured employee to productive employment and not an effort to avoid paying compensation).\nIn this matter, the referee found persuasive and convincing the testimony submitted by Caterpillar, that a position has been made available to the Claimant within his work-related restrictions. Markle v. Caterpillar Tractor Company, Referee\u2019s Decision 2/12/91, Finding of Fact No. 5. Moreover, the referee found credible Caterpillar\u2019s testimony that Markle\u2019s warehouse position was declared surplus by Caterpillar and that the decision to transfer claimant to the shop helper position in the manufacturing department was based on seniority. Id. Finding of Fact No. 6.\nThe referee is the sole arbiter of credibility, vested with broad discretion to judge the credibility of testimony, and is free to reject or accept the testimony of any witness in whole or in part. Northeastern Hospital v. W.C.A.B. (Turiano), 134 Pa.Commw. 164, 578 A.2d 83 (1990). Our review of the record indicates that these findings are supported by substantial evidence.\nFurthermore, Section 413(a) of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, which pertains to modification, provides in pertinent part:\n[W]here compensation has been suspended because the employee\u2019s earnings are equal to or in excess of his wages prior to the injury that payments under the agreement or award may be resumed at any time during the period for which compensation for partial disability is payable, unless it be shown that the loss in earnings does not result from the disability due to the injury.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 772. When reviewing a statute, we are guided by the principles set out in the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1501-1991. The object of all statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). Regardless, when the words of the statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, we will not disregard the letter of the law under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). The legislature decided that compensation payments may be resumed after a suspension \u201cunless it be shown that the loss in earnings does not result from the disability due to the injury.\u201d These words are clear and free from ambiguity. Because claimant\u2019s loss of earnings did not result from the disability due to the injury but from his non-work related emphysema, his worker\u2019s compensation benefits may not be resumed.\nAccordingly, we affirm.\nPAPADAKOS, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nNIX, C.J., files a dissenting opinion in which CAPPY, J., joins.\nMONTEMURO, J., is sitting by designation.\n. In Kachinski claimant was a mechanic employed by Vepco Construction Company. While working on employer\u2019s premises, claimant was injured when a paint can exploded. The explosion caused claimant to fall off the machine he was working on and injure his back. In addition, extensive facial bums were caused by the explosion. Kachinski v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Vepco Construction Co.), 516 Pa. 240, 532 A.2d 374 (1987).\nWorker\u2019s compensation benefits were awarded for the bums, but no award was made for the back injury. Id. Kachinski filed a petition to review the notice of compensation, claiming that his back had also been injured in the paint can accident. Vepco denied that Kachinski had injured his back; additionally, Vepco filed a petition to modify compensation. Employer stated that \u201cclaimant had sufficiently recovered from his original work-related injury as to be able to return to gainful employment which was then presently available in the market place.\u201d Id. at 244, 532 A.2d at 375.\nThe referee concluded, after a hearing, that Kachinski\u2019s bums had healed, and that he did in fact injure his back in the accident. Nevertheless, the referee found that claimant\u2019s back injury had improved to the point where he could no longer be considered totally disabled. Id. The referee reduced claimant's benefits to a level appropriate for partial disability on the basis that the employer had introduced sufficient evidence to establish the existence of \"available work\u201d. Kachinski v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Vepco Construction Co.), 516 Pa. 240, 532 A.2d 374 (1987). The Commonwealth Court reversed and we granted allocatur to determine whether an employer can sustain his burden of showing available work by demonstrating the existence of jobs in the market place instead of showing jobs which have actually been made available to the claimant. Id.\nWe held that a requirement of actual availability of work is consistent with the remedial purpose of the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. Id. at 250, 532 A.2d at 379. Furthermore, we held that the good faith of the participants in the Worker\u2019s Compensation system ensures its viability.\n. 1972, Dec. 6, P.L. 1339, No. 290, \u00a7 3, imd. effective."}
