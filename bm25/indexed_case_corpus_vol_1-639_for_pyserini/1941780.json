{"id": "1941780", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Pomeroy,\nOn March 10, 1967, following a plea of guilty, a court en banc found the appellant, Carl Joseph Smulek, guilty of murder in the first degree for the slaying of his former wife\u2019s father, and sentenced him to life imprisonment. No post-trial motions were filed and no appeal was taken. Subsequently, a petition under the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. L. (1965) 1580, \u00a71,19 P.S. 1180-1, was filed alleging the improper inducement of his guilty plea and the denial of his right to appeal. The post conviction court dismissed the petition after an evidentiary hearing, and on appeal this Court affirmed, per curiam, without opinion. Commonwealth v. Smulek, 434 Pa. 559, 252 A. 2d 199 (1969). Petitioner was represented by counsel throughout these proceedings.\nAppellant then commenced the present proceeding, an action captioned \u201cPetition for Reconsideration of Sentence Under Habeas Corpus\u201d. His basic contention is that the trial court at the degree of guilt hearing acted unconstitutionally in accepting the Commonwealth\u2019s version of the hotly contested facts. The only real challenge, however, is to the sufficiency of the evidence. After a new hearing, two judges of the lower court, sitting en banc, dismissed the petition, holding that appellant was not entitled to relitigate issues already adjudicated. This appeal followed and we affirm.\nFor two reasons we agree that appellant is now foreclosed from questioning the sufficiency of the evidence. First, its caption as a form of \u201chabeas corpus\u201d aside, the instant petition is governed by the Post Conviction Hearing Act, supra. Since, however, the issue of sufficiency does not rise to constitutional stature, it is not cognizable in a PCHA proceeding. Commonwealth v. Lowery, 438 Pa. 89, 263 A. 2d 332 (1970); Commonwealth v. Musser, 437 Pa. 131, 262 A. 2d 678 (1970).\nIn the second place, it is clear that the question of the sufficiency of the evidence has been \u201cfinally litigated\u201d within the meaning of Section 4(a) (3) of the Post Conviction Hearing Act. More precisely, although the merits of the substantive claim itself have not been passed upon, the question of appellant\u2019s procedural capacity to raise the question has been resolved, adversely to him. As stated above, sufficiency of evidence in first degree cases may not be raised by collateral attack, but may be raised only on appeal (preferably preceded by post-trial motions; see Commonwealth v. Robinson, 442 Pa. 512, 276 A. 2d 537 (1971), footnote 2, p. 515; Commonwealth v. Lowery, supra, 438 Pa. at 91). Our decision in the previous appeal in this case, 434 Pa. 559, determined that there had been no denial of Douglas rights following the judgment of sentence. Appellant thus may not now raise substantive issues for appellate consideration.\nOrder affirmed.\nThe facts of the case are recited in detail in the opinion of the lower court: Commonwealth v. Smulek, 69 Lacka. 176 (1968).\nAppellant\u2019s petition is self-prepared, handwritten, and 38 pages in length. Counsel to represent petitioner was appointed ten days after filing of the petition, and has filed a brief in connection with this appeal.\nIn this respect, the Post Conviction Hearing Act has not altered the law relative to collateral attacks as it formerly existed under habeas corpus. \u201cCollateral relief may only be predicated on fundamental or constitutional error and habeas corpus may not be employed in lieu of appeal to correct ordinary trial error.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel.
