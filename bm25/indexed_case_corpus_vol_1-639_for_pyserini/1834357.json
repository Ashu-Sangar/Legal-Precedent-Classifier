{"id": "1834357", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court, 129 Pa.Cmwlth. 114, 564 A.2d 1048, which affirmed a decision of the Board of Finance and Revenue denying a request for a refund of realty transfer taxes paid by the appellant, Eastern Investment Company (Eastern). We affirm.\nThe factual background of the case is as follows. On December 16, 1985, Eastern conveyed a parcel of property by deed to the Redevelopment Authority of Berks County. The deed recited a consideration of $3,880,000.00. At the time of recording the deed, Eastern claimed that the transfer was exempt from the realty transfer tax. In July of 1986, the Department of Revenue (Department) issued a determination that the transfer was subject to tax and that a tax of $38,-800.00 plus interest of $2,415.30 was due. This determination was affirmed by the Department\u2019s Board of Appeals in January of 1987. In March of 1987, Eastern, under protest, paid the tax plus accrued interest of $4,736.17, i.e., a total of $43,536.17. Eastern promptly filed a request for a refund, but the request was denied by the Board of Finance and Revenue. Commonwealth Court affirmed the denial of the refund.\nThe Tax Reform Code of 1971 imposes a tax of one percent on the value of real property transferred by means of any \u201cdocument.\u201d 72 P.S. \u00a7 8102-C. At the time of the present deed transfer the Code defined \u201cdocument,\u201d in pertinent part, as follows:\nDocument. Any deed ... whereby any lands ... within this Commonwealth ... shall be ... granted ... or otherwise conveyed to the grantee ... but does not include ... any transfers to nonprofit industrial development agencies____\n(Emphasis added). Eastern contends that the transfer which it made to the Redevelopment Authority of Berks County constituted one to a \u201cnonprofit industrial development agency,\u201d such that, under this provision, the transfer was exempt from tax.\n\u201cNonprofit industrial development agency\u201d is not defined in the Tax Reform Code. A pertinent definition can be found, however, in the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority Act, 73 P.S. \u00a7 303(g), wherein \u201cindustrial development agency\u201d is defined as:\na nonprofit corporation or a foundation or association organized and existing under the laws of this Commonwealth, regardless of the particular name, to whose members or shareholders no profit shall enure and which shall have as a purpose the promotion, encouragement, construction, development and expansion of new or existing industrial development projects in a critical economic area.\n(Emphasis added).\nA virtually identical definition of \u201cindustrial development agency\u201d is set forth in the Site Development Act, 73 P.S. \u00a7 362(3), where the term is defined as:\na nonprofit corporation or a foundation or association organized and existing under the laws of this Commonwealth, regardless of the particular name, to whose members or shareholders no profit shall enure and which shall have as a purpose the promotion, encouragement, construction, development and expansion of new or existing industrial development projects.\n(Emphasis added). Hence, in both the Industrial Development Authority Act and the Site Development Act, the definitions of \u201cindustrial development agency\u201d are the virtually the same, the only difference being that the former requires the industrial development activities to occur in critical economic areas whereas the latter does not. Another similar definition of \u201cindustrial development agency\u201d is found in the Pennsylvania Redevelopment Area Economic Cooperation and Implementation Act, 73 P.S. \u00a7 333(d), where the term is defined as:\nany incorporated organization, foundation, association or agency, regardless of the particular name, and to whose members or shareholders no profit shall enure, which shall have as a purpose the promotion, encouragement and development of commercial, industrial, manufacturing and research and development enterprises in a redevelopment area or a critical economic area.\n(Emphasis added).\nIn common among all of the foregoing definitions of \u201cindustrial development agency\u201d is the requirement that \u201ca purpose\u201d of the agency be to promote the development of \u201cindustrial\u201d projects or enterprises. In contrast, the Urban Redevelopment Law, under which the Redevelopment Authority of Berks County was formed, provides in 35 P.S. \u00a7 1702(g) for the creation of,\nbodies corporate and politic to be known as Redevelopment Authorities, which shall exist and operate for the public purposes of the elimination of blighted areas through economically and socially sound redevelopment of such areas, as provided by this act, in conformity with the comprehensive general plan of their respective municipalities for residential, recreational, commercial, industrial or other purposes, and otherwise encouraging the provision of healthful homes, a decent living environment and adequate places of employment of the people of this Commonwealth.\n(Emphasis added).\nBased upon the foregoing definitions, it is plain that industrial development agencies and redevelopment authorities are not identical entities. The former are narrow in their focus, being primarily committed to the development of industrial enterprises, while the latter are quite broad in their scope, being committed to residential, recreational, commercial, and other projects in addition to industrial ones. While redevelopment authorities may, at times, be engaged in some of the same types of projects that industrial development agencies pursue, it is clear that there are major differences between the two types of entities. To no extent is the term \u201cindustrial development agency\u201d interchangeable with the term \u201credevelopment authority.\u201d The legislature, in exempting transfers to nonprofit \u201cindustrial development agencies\u201d from the realty transfer tax, 73 P.S. \u00a7 8102-C, supra, did not extend the same exemption to \u201credevelopment authorities.\u201d The Redevelopment Authority of Berks County is a redevelopment authority, not an industrial development agency. Eastern was not, therefore, entitled to claim an exemption from tax when making a transfer of property to the Redevelopment Authority of Berks County. The Commonwealth Court properly affirmed the Board of Finance and Revenue\u2019s determination that Eastern was not entitled to a refund of the taxes paid.\nOrder affirmed.\nThe quoted portion of the statute is that which was in effect at all times relevant to the present case. It may be noted, however, that in 1986 the sections of the Tax Reform Code of 1971 pertaining to realty transfer taxes were revised by the legislature, creating a revised definition of the term \"document\u201d and an enumeration of transfers which are to be deemed \"excluded transactions\u201d for purposes of the tax. 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8101-C \u2014 8102-C.3."}
