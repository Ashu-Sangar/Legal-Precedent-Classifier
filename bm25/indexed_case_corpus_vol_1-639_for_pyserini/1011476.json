{"id": "1011476", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThese two appeals are utterly without merit. The funds upon which interest was allowed by the several, banks did not belong to the appellant, and he could make no profit out of them. If he had contracted for interest to be paid to him, he would have been guilty of a misdemeanor: Act of March 31, 1860, P. L. 382, Sec. 63. What he could not have done directly, public policy will not permit him to do indirectly. The judgment in each case is affirmed."}
