{"id": "880521", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis record discloses no error, of which appellant has any just reason to complain. On the contrary he appears to have been considerately and leniently dealt with by the learned auditor and the court below. His mismanagement of the trust \u2014 using his ward\u2019s funds in his own business, and so mingling the same with his own that it was impossible to trace investments, etc. \u2014 \u25a0 was such as to require the surcharges of interest, etc., and would also have justified the rejection of his entire claim for commissions ; but, as to that, \u201c the appellee does not complain,\u201d and hence the question is not properly before us.\nThere is nothing in either of the specifications of error that requires special notice. The questions involved were sufficiently considered by the court below.\nDecree affirmed on the opinion of the learned president of the 45th judicial district, who specially presided at the hearing, and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
