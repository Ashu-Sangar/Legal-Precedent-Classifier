{"id": "490898", "contents": "The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered January 19th 1880,\nPer Curiam.\nThe affidavit of defence does not allege that at the time the property \u2014 on which the mortgage for purchase-money was given \u2014 was conveyed to the defendant \u2014 the plaintiff had not a good title to the alley-way. This was in 1851, and for aught that appears, the defendant has lost the privilege of the alley, by his own neglect to prosecute his right to it. When a contract of sale has been executed by a deed, the vendee, in order to defend against a security for the purchase-money, must show a title positively bad. The representations made by the vendor at the time of the sale of her right to the alley-way, are clearly immaterial, unless they were false, and the mere fact of an obstruction then existing did not tend to prove them so.\nJudgment affirmed."}
