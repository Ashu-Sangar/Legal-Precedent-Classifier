{"id": "1767219", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Chief Justice.\nAppellant, Richard P. Brightwell, was convicted of, inter alia, both murder of the third degree and voluntary manslaughter for the June 24, 1974 shooting killing of Nanny Brown. Before the trial court accepted these obviously inconsistent verdicts, he called opposing counsel to sidebar and stated that \u201cIt is my understanding that the verdict in this case would be recorded as guilty of murder of the third degree. ... Do you agree to that?\u201d When both counsel agreed, the trial court announced that appellant had been found guilty of murder of the third degree. No objection was taken by appellant. New counsel represented appellant at post-verdict motions, which were denied. Appellant was sentenced to ten-to-twenty years imprisonment. On direct appeal, while represented by the same counsel as on post-verdict motions, appellant argued the inconsistent verdict issue, but we held the issue had been waived because of appellant\u2019s failure to either object at trial or to assert the ineffectiveness of trial counsel. Commonwealth v. Brightwell, 479 Pa. 541, 388 A.2d 1063 (1978).\nAppellant subsequently filed a petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Hearing Act, alleging, inter alia, that both trial and appellate counsel had been ineffective for failing to preserve the claim concerning the inconsistent verdicts. Following an evidentiary hearing, the court denied appellant\u2019s requested relief and this appeal followed.\nAppellant argues instantly that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court\u2019s actions in ordering the verdict be recorded as guilty of murder of the third degree. Appellant further argues that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the effectiveness of trial counsel at both post-verdict motions and on direct appeal. See Commonwealth v. Dancer, 460 Pa. 95, 331 A.2d 435 (1975).\nOur standard of review involving claims of ineffective assistance of counsel is by this time well-settled. As this Court unanimously stated:\n\u201cIn order to determine whether counsel\u2019s assistance was effective, we must be \u2018able to conclude the particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis de-. signed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests.\u2019 Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 604, 235 A.2d 349, 352 (1967). [Emphasis in original.] However, counsel cannot be found ineffective for failing to assert a merit-less claim. Only when an abandoned claim is of arguable merit must we inquire into counsel\u2019s basis for not pursuing it. Commonwealth v. Sherard, 483 Pa. 183, 394 A.2d 971 (1978); Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687 (1977).\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Weathers El, 485 Pa. 28, 32, 400 A.2d 1295, (1979). It is thus incumbent upon us to determine whether appellant\u2019s claim concerning the inconsistent verdict was of arguable merit.\nAppellant argues that the jury\u2019s verdict finding him guilty of both murder of the third degree and voluntary manslaughter for the same killing was inconsistent. As appellant correctly points, out, the major difference between murder of the third degree and voluntary manslaughter is the absence of malice in the latter. We believe appellant\u2019s claim clearly has arguable merit, as evidenced by this Court\u2019s statement on appellant\u2019s direct appeal:\n\u201cHad appellant objected and the court determined the verdict was inconsistent, the court could have directed the jury to retire and reconsider its verdict. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 369 Pa. 120, 85 A.2d 171 (1952); Commonwealth v. Micuso, 273 Pa. 474, 117 A. 211 (1922).\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Brightwell, supra, 479 Pa. at 547, 388 A.2d 1063.\nBelieving appellant\u2019s claim to be of arguable merit, we must proceed to the second step of our analysis; we must determine if appellant\u2019s trial counsel had any reasonable basis designed to effectuate appellant\u2019s interest by not objecting to the inconsistent verdicts.\nAt the evidentiary hearing on appellant\u2019s P.C.H.A. petition, his trial counsel testified as follows:\n\u201c.. . I was relieved when they found him not guilty of the first degree charge. My recollection is that we went to side bar and as Richard indicated the Judge said that obviously it was voluntary manslaughter being part and parcel of third degree homicide did we agree that it was the intention of the jury was to find him guilty of third degree murder and I agreed. I made no objection. It seemed reasonable to me at the time. I cannot, I don\u2019t know that I can go back and put myself in that place and second-guess whether I did the right thing or wrong thing at that time. It seemed to be the right thing at the time. That\u2019s all I can say bout it.\nTrial counsel also responded to the following question by the prosecutor:\n\u201cQ. Would you be able to say that anything was to be gained by letting the jury go back in the retirement room and deliberate?\n\u201cA. Since the Clerk had not recorded the verdict and the Judge had not accepted any verdict at that time I didn\u2019t want to give the jury another opportunity to go out and come back with first degree murder. I wanted the jury since they had the opportunity to review the entire verdict, the Clerk hadn\u2019t recorded the verdict, it hadn\u2019t been made part of the record, he was either going to have the verdict come in at third degree or have the jury go back and consider it. My only consideration was that I didn\u2019t want to send the jury back and do anything more damaging to us. Whether this was correct or in error in hindsight I can\u2019t say.\u201d\nTrial counsel was correct in his assertion that an unrecorded jury verdict, though announced, is of no force and is alterable or amendable. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 359 Pa. 287, 59 A.2d 128 (1948); Commonwealth v. Dzvonick, 450 Pa. 98, 297 A.2d 912 (1972). Thus, had counsel objected, the Court could have ordered the jury to redeliberate on all possible counts of homicide. Although counsel could have asked that the jury be ordered to redeliberate on only murder of the third degree and voluntary manslaughter, the following passage is particularly instructive.\n\u201cThe test is not whether other alternatives were more reasonable, employing a hindsight evaluation of the record. Although weigh the alternatives we must, the balance tips in favor of a finding of effective assistance as soon as it is determined that trial counsel\u2019s decisions had any reasonable basis.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 604-05, 235 A.2d 349 (1967) (Emphasis in original) (Footnote omitted).\nSince trial counsel had a reasonable basis for not objecting, appellant was not denied the effective assistance of counsel.\nOrder affirmed.\nNIX, J., concurs in the result.\nROBERTS, J., files a dissenting opinion."}
