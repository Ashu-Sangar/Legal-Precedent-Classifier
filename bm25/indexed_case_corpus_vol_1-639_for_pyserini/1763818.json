{"id": "1763818", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nOn April 27, 1977 appellants Tomasetti and Harper, both of whom were commissioned as deputy game protectors, were called to a meeting at which the supervisor for the Southeast Division of the Pennsylvania Game Commission recalled their commissions and summarily discharged them from their duties as deputy game protectors. On May 13, 1977, the Executive Director of the Pennsylvania Game Commission issued a formal written approval of the dismissal. Appellants on August 14, 1978 formally requested a hearing regarding their discharge as required by the Game Law of 1937. The Commission denied the request for a hearing.\nOn September 5, 1978 appellants filed a complaint in mandamus in the Commonwealth Court and respondents filed objections in the nature of a demurrer. The case was submitted on briefs to the Commonwealth Court, and on November 19, 1979, the court filed an Opinion and Order sustaining respondent\u2019s preliminary objections and dismissing appellants\u2019 complaint. Tomasetti and Harper then appealed to this Court, seeking a reversal of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s Order and reinstatement of the complaint.\nThe main issue in the case is whether two sections of the Game Law of 1937, Act of June 3, 1937, P.L. 1225, Art. II, \u00a7 201, et seq. can be read in pari materia or whether the sections are in irreconcilable conflict. Section 208 of the Game Law, entitled \u201cDeputy game protectors,\u201d provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\nThe commission may appoint competent men throughout the Commonwealth to be known as deputy game protectors, in such numbers as the commission may deem necessary, who shall possess the rights and powers given by law to game protectors and be subject to all requirements and regulations, either of the law or of the rules of the commission, controlling the action of such game protectors.\n34 P.S. \u00a7 1311.208 (1967) (Emphasis added).\nSection 206 of the Game Law, which discusses appointment and removal of game protectors, in pertinent part, provides as follows:\nGame protectors and all other employes shall be removable at the discretion of the commission or may be suspended without compensation by the director pending action of the commission: Provided, however, That prior to such removal all game protectors and other regular employes shall be given a fair and impartial hearing before the commission\u2019s established trial board, unless the employe waives such hearing. The trial board\u2019s findings and recommendations shall be given due consideration by the commission.\n34 P.S. \u00a7 1311.206 (1967) (Emphasis added).\nThe Commonwealth Court held that deputy game protectors are not \u201cregular employees\u201d within the meaning of the Civil Service Act, Act of August 5, 1941, P.L. 752, as amended, 71 P.S. \u00a7 741.3(1), which defines a regular employee as \u201c[one] who has been appointed to a position in the classified service in accordance with this act after completing his probationary period.\u201d Since appellants were not classified, the lower court found that they were not \u201cregular employees.\u201d We disagree, however, that this definition of \u201cregular employees\u201d is controlling. Section 208 of the Game Law of 1937, Act of June 3,1937, P.L. 1225, Art. II, \u00a7 208, 34 P.S. \u00a7 1311.208 must be read in conjunction with section 206 of the Act. 34 P.S. \u00a7 1311.206. When so read, deputy game protectors must be given \u201ca fair and impartial hearing before the commission\u2019s established trial board, . . .\u201d\nSection 208 gives deputy game protectors \u201cthe rights and powers given by law to game protectors,\u201d and Section 206 provides that game protectors \u201cand other employees\u201d are given the right to a fair hearing before removal from office. Reading the two sections together, it must be con-eluded that deputy game protectors have the right to a hearing prior to removal from office, because they have the same rights as game protectors.\nWe conclude, therefore, that appellants\u2019 right to a hearing is stated in the Game Law. Their request for a hearing, therefore, was improperly denied. The order of the Commonwealth Court will be reversed and the case remanded to that court with directions to reinstate appellants\u2019 complaint. If the Commonwealth wishes to remove appellants from their positions, it shall grant them, as they have requested, fair and impartial hearings.\nOrder of the Commonwealth Court reversed and case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nEAGEN, C. J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case."}
