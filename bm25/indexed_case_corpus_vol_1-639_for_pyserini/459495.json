{"id": "459495", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Allen M. Steaene,\nThis appeal is from a decree of the orphans\u2019 court disallowing a claim against a decedent\u2019s estate. The question is whether the evidence was sufficient to establish the claim.\nThe claim, representing cash loans in approximately $15,000., Avas made by the administrator of the estate of ' a mother against the estate of her deceased son. The mother died, intestate, in 1941, leaving to survive her a son (this decedent) and two daughters \u2014 one by a previous marriage. This decedent died in 1942,. testate, leaving his entire estate to his widow.\nAt the audit of the account, the administrator of the estate of the mother presented a claim against the son\u2019s estate. It was based upon (1) judgment note for $4,000. dated December 5, 1931; (2) judgment note for $5,000. dated 1922 or 1923; (3) three I. O. U. writings, one for $200. dated December 20, 1934, another one for $200. dated July 25, 1939, and another one for $100. dated May 24,1939; (4) a loan for $6,000. on an alleged oral agreement of May 1932; (5) judgment note for $1,000. dated July 2,1913.\nThe judgment note for $4,000. dated December 5, 1931, and the judgment note for $5,000. dated either in 1922 or 1923 were secured by an assignment dated December 5, 1931, whereby decedent assigned his interest in his father\u2019s estate to his mother. The $5,000. note was not produced and no explanation was given concerning its disappearance. The assignment refers to a note dated May 2, 1932a date about five months after the date of the assignment. The alleged oral agreement of May 1932 to repay a cash loan by the mother to decedent was not proved with proper and sufficient evidence, and on its face, is barred by the statute of limitations. Of the three papers regarded as I. O. TJ.\u2019s of decedent, one of them is incomplete and means nothing; one is barred by the statute of limitations and the other, according to the evidence, was not the property of the mother. The judgment note for $1,000. dated in 1913 is presumed by law to have been paid, and there is nothing in the testimony to rebut such presumption.\nTo overcome the manifest infirmities of the documentary proof submitted, claimant produced a brother-in-law of decedent, the husband of decedent\u2019s sister. This witness was a lawyer, who represented the estate of decedent\u2019s father. While the witness was not the record counsel for the estate of decedent\u2019s mother, his law partner was. The witness had full knowledge concerning, and participated in, the settlement of the mother\u2019s estate. He also had complete knowledge of, and participated in, dealings with decedent and the estates of both the father and mother. This witness and his wife (sister of decedent) undertook, by oral testimony, to explain the details of the rather complicated family financial transactions, and to establish, by admission of decedent, the existence and validity of the indebtedness herein claimed.\nIt will serve no useful purpose to discuss the details of these transactions. None of the testimony rose to sufficient proof that decedent at any time admitted that he was indebted to his mother at the time of her decease in any definite amount. Indeed when the sister, after the mother\u2019s death, sought to secure such an admission from her brother, the decedent, and the exact amount of the alleged indebtedness, decedent declined to make the admission. All of the testimony concerning such alleged admissions by decedent were of such vague, general and indefinite character that they are of no value to this inquiry.\nThis litigation appears to be an attempt to equalize a family distribution. It was testified that because decedent\u2019s father failed by his will to make an equal division among his two children and the child of his wife by a former marriage, decedent and Ms sister determined to remedy the omission. The sister, in writing, assigned her interest in her mother\u2019s estate to her half sister. Both the sister and her husband testified that the decedent had orally agreed to do the same. If this claim were allowed, the effect of the sister\u2019s assignment would be to make good a large part of the alleged promise of decedent to the half sister. One of claimant\u2019s witnesses, however, had quite a different version of this contention. She testified that decedent stated that he regarded himself \u201cmorally\u201d bound to pay his half sister something.\nIt is also to be observed that an assignment dated May 31,1932 by decedent to three trustees (one of whom was the brother-in-law witness), securing indebtedness to the estates of the father and mother and others, was released and cancelled by the trustees in 1936 and the property returned to decedent. While the indebtedness to the mother was not released, the redelivery of pledged property is significant. When the estate of the father of decedent was settled and distribution made in 1941 the present claimant, also a fiduciary in the father\u2019s estate, and with all the present facts known to the parties and to the brother-in-law (the attorney for the estate), distributed sizeable sums in personal and real estate, without demand or effort to collect the present claimed indebtedness. What is of even greater significance, the claimant, the administrator of the mother\u2019s estate (a corporate fiduciary), with full knowledge, failed to include in its inventory or account all or any part of the alleged indebtedness of decedent as an asset of the estate. The testimony of the trust officer is that while he knew of the claim, he understood that the parties intended to settle the matter \u201coutside\u201d and that decedent was to pay the amount thereof to his half sister. Distribution was made by the administrator to the decedent of his distributive share of his mother\u2019s estate without deduction of the amount of Ms alleged indebtedness. It is unusual for a fiduciary knowingly to pay a distributive share without deduction of the indebtedness of a distributee. It is also to be observed that the estate of the mother amounted to about $5,000., whereas the alleged indebtedness not accounted for amounts to about $15,000. The reasons now given for the exclusion of the claim as an asset are not convincing.\nJudge Copeland, in his well-considered opinion, states \u201cThe failure to produce these notes or explain the failure to produce them, presents a situation wherein it is just as easy to conclude that they have been paid or cancelled as they still represent a valid claim\u201d. Also \u201cThe financial dealings of [decedent] were apparently complicated and it is not all clear that any particular sum was due from him to [the mother] at the time of her death\u201d; and \u201cThe actions of the parties to this proceeding are inconsistent with the existence at this time of any debt. . . .\u201d We agree with these findings of fact and conclusions of law, which are amply supported by the evidence.\nThe measure of proof required to prove a claim against a decedent\u2019s estate in the orphans\u2019 court is stated in Hirst\u2019s Estate, 274 Pa. 286, 288, 117 A. 682: \u201cA claim against the estate of a decedent must be as definite and precise as is required to recover a debt in an action at law. While formal pleadings are dispensed with, the claimant should produce evidence showing the nature and character of the debt, its origin, the terms of the contract and the exact amount claimed to be due\u201d. See Deal\u2019s Estate, 321 Pa. 484, 184 A. 453.\nThese family transactions were between a mother and son who had lived together in complete harmony until the mother\u2019s death. The claim is very old. The first transaction occurred nearly 30 years before decedent\u2019s death. Both parties to the transaction are deceased. It has been consistently held that a claim which might have been presented to a party in his lifetime will be subjected to most careful scrutiny. Tlie terms of the contract must be clear, certain and definite. Parol evidence offered to support it must be direct and positive: Gilbraith\u2019s Estate, 270 Pa. 288, 113 A. 361; Bangert v. Provident Trust Co., 314 Pa. 442, 171 A. 564; Rae\u2019s Estate, 345 Pa. 48, 25 A. 2d 706. This rule should be applied with even greater strictness when the claim is stale and both parties to the transaction are dead.\nWhile certain of the notes are under seal, the record facts and the testimony reveal that a presumption of payment or forgiveness has been raised, which has not been overcome: compare Conrad\u2019s Estate, 333 Pa. 561, 3 A. 2d 697; Smith\u2019s Estate, 343 Pa. 539, 23 A. 2d 450.\nThe appeal is dismissed, and the decree affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost."}
