{"id": "458708", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the decree of the court below interpreting the directions in the codicil of Eleanor T. Lippincott, dated March 4, 1913, as to the paying oyer of the principal of her daughter Mabel\u2019s share of a trust fund of \u201c$25,367.50 after her daughter Mabel\u2019s death, to testatrix\u2019s daughters Bessie and Helen and their issue in equal shares.\u201d Helen (Mrs. James H. Donnon) died on March 19, 1928, and her estate was settled and awarded by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Montgomery County to her son, as her residuary legatee, J. Henry Donnon, Jr. Francis Donnon claimed that he was a son of Helen Lippincott, and after Mabel Lippincott\u2019s death he made a claim to share equally with his brother Henry in the principal of the trust fund which had been set apart as provided in the codicil for Mabel Lippincott\u2019s \u201ccomfortable maintenance and support\u201d during her life. Francis\u2019 claim to be a child of Helen Lippincott Donnon was accepted by the court aud no appeal was taken from the adjudication to that effect. The question for us to determine is whether or not the appointment in the codicil gave to Helen a vested remainder. If it did, Francis\u2019 claim to a part of the \u201cprincipal of her [Mabel\u2019s] share\u201d must be rejected, because by her will Helen gave her estate to her son, J. Henry Donnon, Jr. But if the word \u201cissue\u201d is used in the codicil in a substitutionary sense, that is, as a word of purchase and not as a word of limitation, both sons take in their own right directly from the appointer.\nThe majority of the court below held, in an opinion by Judge Hunter, that there was nothing in the will \u201cwhich requires us to give the word \u2018issue\u2019 the broad and artificial meaning of \u2018heirs of the body.\u2019 \u201d Judges Klein and Ladner in dissenting from the majority opinion declared that \u201cthe rule is firmly entrenched in our law\u201d that \u201cthe word \u2018issue\u2019 in a will . . . where it is without explanatory words, of itself, is a word of limitation,\u201d citing Clark v. Baker, 3 S. & R. 470 (1817), and other cases. They say: \u201cthe testatrix in the present case used the word \u2018issue\u2019 as a word of limitation and intended to vest her estate in her two daughters, Bessie and Helen.\u201d\nThe controversy in this case stems from the historic Buie in Shelley\u2019s case, which held that when the ancestor by any gift or conveyance takes an estate of freehold, and in the same gift or conveyance an estate is limited either mediately or immediately to his heirs in fee or in tail, that always in such cases \u201cheirs\u201d is a word of limitation and not a word of purchase, gee 2 Blackstone, page 172. In Shapley v. Diehl, 203 Pa. 566, 53 A. 374, Justice Mitchell speaking for this court said: \u201cThe rule in Shelley\u2019s case is a rule of law, not a rule of construction and where a case falls within it, it applies inexorably without reference to intent.\u201d In Doebler\u2019s Appeal, 64 Pa. 9, 17, Justice Sharswood speaking for this court said of this Rule that it was \u201cunbending\u201d that \u201cit is not competent for the testator to prevent this legal consequence by any declaration, no matter how plain.\u201d\nIf the word \u201cheirs\u201d instead of \u201cissue\u201d had been used in the codicil now before us, we would be obliged to hold that the daughters Bessie and Helen took a vested remainder in the property referred to. There is no such \u201cunbending rule\u201d as to the word \u201cissue\u201d as there is in respect to the word \u201cheirs\u201d, and courts when called upon to construe the word \u201cissue\u201d as used in this codicil should determine from either the context or the entire instrument whether the testator meant by the use of this word to describe the quality of the estate of the first taker or meant to create a substitutionary gift for the first taker\u2019s \u201cissue\u201d. The word \u201cissue\u201d has never been more than prima facie a word of limitation; in many instances it has been interpreted as a word of purchase. Baron Parke and his judicial associates in Lees v. Mosley, et al., 160 Eng. Reports [589] 241 (1836), said: \u201cThe word \u2018issue\u2019, however, is more flexible than the expression \u2018heirs of the body\u2019. In the case of Cursham v. Newland (2 Bing. N. C. 58) the word \u2018issue\u2019 was held to be a word of purchase, . . . The words \u2018heirs\u2019 and \u2018heirs male\u2019 . . . must be words of limitation, because heirs are not co-existent. That does not necessarily apply to the word \u2018issue\u2019 which may mean existing issue, or all the descendants, Alderson, B. When the words \u2018heirs of the body\u2019 are used in their proper sense, it is certain that heirs in succession are meant. Therefore, a devise to heirs of the body, \u2018share and share alike,\u2019 is an inconsistency; but a devise to the issue, \u2018share and share alike,\u2019 is not necessarily so.\u201d\nIn English\u2019s Estate, 270 Pa. 1, 112 A. 913, this court said: \u201cWhile \u2018issue,\u2019 when used in a devise, has been held time and again to mean the same as \u2018heirs of the body,\u2019 yet such construction was adopted only on the theory that the word was probably so intended by the testator, and not with the idea that the term \u2018issue,\u2019 of and in itself, is the equivalent of the technical phrase \u2018heirs of the body\u2019: Taylor v. Taylor, 63 Pa. 481, 484.\u201d We said further: \u201cThe word \u2018issue\u2019 [as used in a will] never had such technical significance\u201d as the word \u201cheirs,\u201d citing Stout v. Good, 245 Pa. 383, 385, \u201cand now that estates tail have ceased to exist in Pennsylvania (since the Act of 1855), there is no apparent reason why, in order to construe a devise into an estate tail, so that it may be held a fee, the word \u2018issue\u2019 should have a technical meaning forced on it for the purpose of bringing a devise within the rule of Shelley\u2019s Case.\u201d In Stout v. Good, 245 Pa. 383, 91 A. 613, this court held that where words \u201csuch as children, or the like\u201d are used in a devise, \u201cthe burden rests upon him who claims them to be the equivalent of \u2018heirs\u2019 or \u2018heirs of his body\u2019 to show they were so intended.\u201d In Mayhew\u2019s Estate, 307 Pa. 84, 160 A. 724, this court referred to \u201cthe artificial conclusion to the effect that \u2018issue\u2019 meant \u2018heirs of the body\u2019 reached by early courts, influenced by a leaning toward the rule in Shelley\u2019s case,\u201d and declared that it \u201ccan do longer be regarded as applicable in interpreting the word where the context of the will does not lead to such conclusion.\u201d\nIt is argued that those three cases cited were all subsequent to the date of the codicil in question, 1913, and that these decisions \u201cchanged the theretofore declared rule.\u201d The answer to this is (1) that the decisions referred to did not purport to \u201cchange the rule\u201d but to point out that for a long period this court had not felt bound by the Rule in Shelley\u2019s case to construe \u201cissue\u201d as a word of limitation. In English\u2019s Estate, supra, where the will was executed in 1904, this court said: \u201cWe must first see what fixed legal meaning, if any, that word [issue], as here used, had at the date of the will.\u201d We also said in that opinion that the Act of July 9, 1897, P. L. 213, placed a different meaning on the phrase \u201cfailure of issue\u201d as used in a will and that since that Act the phrase no longer imported \u201can indefinite failure of issue\u201d and that the testatrix in that case in using the word \u201cissue\u201d was not \u201cindicating a line of inheritance from the devisee\u201d but was describing \u201cthe persons next to take from her\u201d; (2) that as early as 1870, it was declared by this court in Taylor v. Taylor, 63 Pa. 481, in an opinion by Justice Si-iarswood that the word \u201cissue\u201d when used \u201cin a will is to be construed as a word of purchase or of limitation, as will best effectuate the intention of the testator gathered from the entire instrument.\u201d Justice Sharswood added \u201cThis was well expressed long ago by Chief Justice Wiles : Why does the word issue in a will signify the same as heirs of the body? Only because it may be supposed that the testator, who was ignorant of the law, intended it should have that construction. It does not, therefore, ex vi termini create an estate tail in a will as heirs of the body do in a deed, but only when it appears to be the intent of the testator that the word should have that construction, or, at least, that it does not appear that the intent of the testator was otherwise\u201d: Ginger v. White, Willes Eng. Repts. 125 p. 348.\nAs early as 1837 this court in Wells v. Ritter, 3 Wharton 208, said of the word \u201cissue\u201d: \u201cChief Baron Yelverton, in Mandeville v. Carrick, 3 Ridgeway\u2019s P. C. 365, considers it, technically, a word of purchase. Lord Kenyon also said, in Doe v. Collis, 4 Term Rep. 200, that it is generally considered a word of purchase, and indeed universally so in deeds, though in a will it may be taken as a word of purchase or of limitation, as will best answer the intention of the testator.\u201d\nIt is clear that in interpreting the word \u201cissue\u201d as used in wills, our courts, though not always consistent, were unfettered from the unbending Rule in Shelley\u2019s case for nearly a century before our decision in English\u2019s Estate, supra, which the appellants and the dissenting judges of the court below look upon as \u201cbringing about a change in the law\u201d eight years after this codicil was executed and which \u201cchange\u201d could have been unknown, they say, to \u201cthe expert legal draftsmen who prepared the will and codicils\u201d unless they \u201ccan be charged with prescience.\u201d\nThe much earlier decisions we have herein referred to and many others of the same purport must have been well known to these \u201cexpert legal draftsmen\u201d and they must have been well aware of the fact that the tendency for over a century was to give to the word \u201cissue\u201d its commonly accepted meaning, to wit, a description of the persons next to take from the testator and not a line of inheritance.\nIn the codicil the testator disposed of three separate portions of property. The first was one-third of the property over which she had \u201cthe right of appointment,\u201d and this she gave to each of her \u201cdaughters, Bessie Lippincott and Helen Lippincott absolutely\u201d. The income of one-third still undisposed of she gave to trustees for the support of her daughter Mabel and the \u201cbalance\u201d of that income she gave to her \u201cdaughters Bessie and Helen or the survivor of them\u201d. If one daughter predeceased the other, the latter would receive all of that \u201cbalance\u201d of income. That left the principal of the above \u201cone-third\u201d undisposed of. If the testatrix had intended to give this to her two daughters Bessie and Helen \u201cabsolutely,\u201d she knew how to execute that intention, for she had just done that very thing in respect to the other two-thirds of the property. If she had intended that upon the death of either Bessie or Helen, before Mabel the life-tenant, the survivor of these two daughters should take all of the principal of that, one-third, she also knew how to execute that intention for she had just done that very thing with the \u201cexcess income\u201d from that one-third. She did neither; but, on the contrary, she provided that upon Mabel\u2019s death \u201cthe principal of her share\u201d should be paid over to the \u201cdaughters Bessie and Helen and their issue in equal shares.\u201d We think that in so doing she used the word \u201cissue\u201d as a word of purchase and intended to create a substitutionary gift for the respective issue or children of Bessie and Helen in case either or both of these daughters died before the distribution provided for on the death of the life-tenant should be made.\nThis conclusion is strengthened by the following circumstances. In her first codicil, dated November 9,1912, the testatrix disavowed any intention of exercising the power of appointment given her by the will of her husband. A son, this claimant, was born to her daughter Helen, in Chicago on January 26, 1913. On March 4, 1913, or 37 days after \u201cissue\u201d was born to Helen, the testatrix exercised the power of appointment given her by her husband in his will. It was certainly a natural thing for this grandmother to provide in that codicil for Helen\u2019s recently born \u201cissue\u201d should Helen not be living when the time arrived for the distribution of the principal which had been set apart for the support of the life-tenant. The use of the word \u201cor\u201d instead of the word \u201cand\u201d after the names of the daughters would more clearly have effectuated the intention we have found to exist in the mind of the testatrix, but it is well known that the words \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor\u201d are frequently used interchangeably. We said in Hemphill\u2019s Estate, 345 Pa. 451, 29 A. 2d 3: \u201cTo effectuate the intention of a testator, the word \u2018and\u2019 may be read \u2018or\u2019.\u201d\nThe decree is affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost.\nThe codicil reads as follows: \u201cWith the intention of exercising the power of appointment given me by the will of my husband William Aaron Lippincott, I give, devise and bequeath all the property over which I have the right of appointment under the will of my said husband as follows: One third thereof I give to each of my daughters Bessie Lippincott and Helen Lippincott absolutely. The remaining one third I give to my said two daughters and to my son-in-law Tristram O. Colket in trust to apply so much of the income thereof as may be necessary to the comfortable maintenance and support of my daughter Mabel Lippincott, and to pay over any balance of income in excess of what may be necessary for the comfortable maintenance and support of my daughter Mabel to my daughters Bessie and Helen or the survivor of them and upon the death of my said daughter Mabel to pay over the principal of her share to my said daughters Bessie and Helen and their issue in equal shares.\u201d\nin Van Grutten v. Foxwell, House of Lords Appeal Cases for 1897, at page 658, Lord Macnaghten gave an interesting review of tlie origin and purpose of this Buie, which, he said, \u201chas a curious history,\u201d and its purpose \u201chas been the subject of controversy. The better view seems to be that it is a rule of tenure founded on feudal principles, and that its purpose was to prevent the lord being defrauded of the chief fruits of seigniory. . . . Others, rather I think in anticipation of the course of events and the development of modern ideas, have discovered that it was designed to facilitate the alienation of property and the satisfaction of the ancestor\u2019s debt, while one very learned writer is of the opinion that its main object was to exclude the possibility of creating \u2018an amphibious species of inheritance\u2019, calculated to introduce confusion and disorder into the system of our law.\u201d\nIn Fed. Land Bank v. Walker, 345 Pa. 185, 26 A. 2d 436, this court in an opinion by Justice Pabkeb pointed out in footnote 2(a) at page 189 that in twelve cases, beginning with Gernet v. Lynn, 31 Pa. 94, the word \u201cchildren\u201d as used in wills was construed as a word of purchase. One of the cases cited by Justice Parker was Oyster v. Knull, 137 Pa. 448, 20 A. 624, where this court said that the word \u201cchildren\u201d as used in a will \u201cis primarily and generally a word of purchase; and, while it may be used to signify \u2018heirs\u2019, or \u2018heirs of the body,\u2019 it wiU not be so construed unless the testator has employed other words indicative of an intention to use it as a word of limitation.\u201d To the same effect was Affolter v. May, 115 Pa. 54, 8 A. 20, and in Huber's Appeal, Gaul's Estate, 80 Pa. 348, 356, both cited by Justice Pabkeb. In the latter case we said: \u201cOne of the ordinary and most familiar principles of construction is, that the word \u2018children\u2019 is primarily a word of purchase.\u201d\nIn a footnote on Archer\u2019s Case, 1 Coke, 66 b, p. 674 of 27 Harvard Law Review, appears this statement; \u201cNon-technical words such as \u2018issue\u2019 or \u2018person or persons who shall be heirs at the death of the life tenant\u2019 have been construed as an individual person or class. Lodington v. Kime, 1 Salk. 224 (issue) ; Bowles\u2019 Case, 11 Co. 79 b (issue) ; Bannester v. Lang, 17 L.T. N.S. 137 (issue) ; Evans v. Evans, [1892] 2 Ch. 173 (persons).\u201d In Wallace v. Wallace, 130 Atl. Rep. 116, the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut said: \u201cWhere the term \u2018issue\u2019 is used in correlation with parent, we have held, in construing other wills, that children were meant by issue, and such has been the general holding elsewhere.\u201d\nThe modern tendency, since the Buie in Shelley\u2019s case no longer serves its ieudal purpose, to throw off the fetters of that Bule and the fetters forged out of it when the words \u201cissue\u201d or \u201cchildren\u201d were used in devises as a possible equivalent of the word \u201cheirs,\u201d is manifested in the statutes passed in many states in reference to that Buie and the statutes passed in England and Pennsylvania relative to the conveyance of a fee. In England it was provided by statute, 1890 Victorian Statute 3626, that in devises of land, words of limitation should no longer be necessary to pass a fee. By our own Act of April 1, 1909, P. L. 91, Sec. 3, it was provided that the words \u201cgrant and convey, or either one of said words in any deed hereafter executed, shaU he adjudged an express covenant to the grantee, his heirs and assigns, to wit . . .\u201d See also the Act of April 30, 1925, P. L. 404.\n\u201cWhen a statute does away with the necessity of using words of limitation to pass the fee, the reason for construing \u2018issue\u2019 as a word of limitation no longer exists.\u201d Note on p. 989 of 33 Harvard Law Beview and citing 2 Jarman on Wills, 6 Eng. ed. 1950, 51."}
