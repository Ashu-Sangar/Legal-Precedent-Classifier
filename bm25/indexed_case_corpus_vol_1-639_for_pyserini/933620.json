{"id": "933620", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe sale was under the control of the court and appellants bought with knowledge of that fact, and of the terms. We do not find any abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s interpretation of its own order as to the sale, or its action on the facts before it. The judgment is therefore affirmed for the reasons given by the learned judge in his opinion."}
