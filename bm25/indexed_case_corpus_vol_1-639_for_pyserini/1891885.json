{"id": "1891885", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nIn this suit for breach of implied warranty of fitness, the court below granted defendants\u2019 motion for judgment on the pleadings filed pursuant to Pa. R.C.P. 1034. Therefore, we must consider as presently admitted by defendants all well-pleaded allegations of fact in the complaint. Smith v. Brown-Borhek Co., 414 Pa. 325, 200 A. 2d 398 (1964).\nThe crucial paragraph in the complaint alleges: \u201cOn or about June 14, 1961, the Plaintiff was in the employ of the Giant Portland Cement Co., . . . and on said date Plaintiff commenced wearing a pair of safety work shoes which had been supplied to him by Giant Portland Cement Co., which had been purchased by them from Lehigh Safety Shoe Co. . . ., which shoes were . . . manufactured by the Defendant, EndicottJohnson Shoe Co.\u201d\nThe complaint continues that as a result of wearing the shoes, plaintiff developed extensive contact dermatitis of the feet and hands.\nThe court below held: \u201cThe word \u2018supplied\u2019 is a broad term and could include any number of relations. When used in the context of plaintiff\u2019s complaint, that an employer supplied safety shoes to its employee, we take it to mean something similar to the supply by a government to its soldiers through a supply sergeant. It may be a fringe benefit, but it is not a sale and purchase.\n\u201cResort to the depositions taken in this case supports that connotation for the term. . . .\u201d\nWe must observe at this point that the court\u2019s consideration of the depositions was improper. When ruling upon a motion for judgment on the pleadings, a court may not consider depositions or other collateral evidence. Emery v. Metzner, 191 Pa. Superior Ct. 440, 445, 156 A. 2d 627, 630 (1959); Bogojavlensky v. Logan, 181 Pa. Superior Ct. 312, 124 A. 2d 412 (1956); 2A Anderson, Penna. Civil Practice \u00a71034.21 (Supp. 1964); 1 Goodrich-Amram, \u00a71034(b)-l (Supp. 1964).\nThe court below stated that \u201csupplied . . . could include any number of relations,\u201d yet proceeded to grant defendants\u2019 motion based upon the court\u2019s own limited (and, to plaintiff, most unfavorable) interpretation of one of those relations. This Court cannot hold, on the record which we may consider at this stage of the litigation, that, as a matter of fact or law, plaintiff is excluded from the class of persons to whom the implied warranties extend under the Uniform Commercial Code, April 6, 1953, P. L. 3, \u00a7\u00a72-314, 2-315, 2-318, as amended, 12A P.S. \u00a7\u00a72-314, 2-315, 2-318 (Supp. 1963), and the developing case law.\nJudgment on the pleadings may be entered only in a case which is clear and free from doubt. Smith v. Brown-Borhek Co., supra. The court below indicated that plaintiff\u2019s basic allegation was susceptible of many interpretations. This being so, the relief to be afforded defendants is not final judgment against plaintiff. The entry of judgment on the pleadings, therefore, was improper.\nReversed and remanded with a procedendo.\nOur present disposition is without prejudice to plaintiff\u2019s request (in his brief) for leave to amend."}
