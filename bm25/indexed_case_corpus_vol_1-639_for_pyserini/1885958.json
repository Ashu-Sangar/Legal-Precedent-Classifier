{"id": "1885958", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nThis is an action of mandamus to compel the Board of Elections of Washington County to accept the nomination papers of appellants, Mike Packrall and Frank Jones, Jr., as the candidates of the \u201cGood Government Party\u201d for the office of county commissioner.\nThe undisputed facts are that Packrall filed nomination petitions to have his name placed on the primary ballot of the Democratic Party for the offices of county commissioner and county treasurer. Within the permitted period, he withdrew both of these petitions. Thereafter nomination papers were filed by the Good Government Party nominating Packrall and Jones for the office of county commissioner. The county board of elections refused to accept the nomination papers and the court below affirmed the refusal on the ground that Packrall\u2019s prior filing of a nomination petition disqualified him, and that Packrall\u2019s ineligibility also invalidated the nomination of Jones. We hold that the court below ruled incorrectly in this matter.\nSection 976 of the Pennsylvania Election Code provides that no nomination paper shall be accepted \u201cif the candidate named therein has filed a nomination petition for any public office for the ensuing primary, or has been nominated for any such office by nomination papers previously filed.\u201d In holding that section 976 made Packrall ineligible for nomination, the court below interpreted the prohibition as extending to the mere filing of a prior petition, regardless of the status of that petition at the time the nomination paper is filed. The court stated that otherwise a prospective candidate \u201ccould wait and see who his opponents were and if he felt they were too strong politically to successfully contest their nomination in the Primary, he could withdraw and have his name submitted to the voters in the General Election merely by getting sufficient signatures to Nomination Papers.\u201d\nWe conclude that the court below attributed the wrong purpose to section 976. The real purpose of this part of the so-called \u201cparty raiding\u201d provisions is to prevent the election ballot from being cluttered by candidates who are seeking to multiply the number of times their name appears on the ballot under various inviting labels. See Thompson v. Morrison, 352 Pa. 616, 625, 44 A. 2d 55, 59 (1945) (dissenting opinion by former Chief Justice Jones). The legislative remedy was to limit each person to being a candidate of one political group, a choice which could be made any time before the close of the nomination period. Section 976, therefore, requires only that the person seeking nomination not be the candidate of another political group at the time the nomination paper is filed\nAt the time of filing the nomination papers, Pack-rail had withdrawn his nomination petition and hence was not a candidate for the Democratic primary. Cf. In re Lower Allen Township School Directors, 16 Pa. D. & C. 2d 500, aff\u2019d per curiam sub nom, Carbone Appeal, 395 Pa. 581, 150 A. 2d 533 (1959). Accordingly, section 976 did hot prevent the acceptance of his nomination paper as the candidate of the Good Government Party.\nAs for the evil envisaged by the court below, one might question either its significance or its elimination through the device of regulating the filing of nomination petitions. For example, a prospective candidate could still wait until the last day for filing petitions in order to decide whether his opponents \u201cwere too strong politically\u201d to contest in the primary election. In any event, however, the question of whether this alleged evil necessitates a further restriction on the nomination process is one for legislative and not judicial determination.\nJudgment reversed with direction to accept appellants\u2019 nomination papers.\nMr. Justice Eagen dissents.\nA nomination petition may be withdrawn any time within seven days after the last day for filing the same. Act of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, \u00a7914, as amended by the Act of May 21, 1943, P. L. 353, \u00a71, 25 P.S. \u00a72874 (Supp. 1962).\nThe Election Code distinguishes between political parties and political bodies. Act of June 3, 1937, P. U. 1333, \u00a7801, as amended by the Act of July 28, 1941, P. L. 526, \u00a71, 25 P.S. \u00a72831 (Supp. 1962). A political group which receives more than a certain number of votes at the preceding general or municipal election is deemed a political party and permitted to select its candidates by the primary election method. A prospective candidate places his name on the primary ballot by filing a nomination petition. Any other political group is deemed a political body and must select its candidates by the more difficult proeess of filing nomination papers. See generally Brown v. Finnegan, 8 Pa. D. & C. 2d 780, 783-84, aff\u2019d per curiam, 389 Pa. 609, 133 A. 2d 809 (1957).\nAct of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1333, \u00a7976, as amended by the Act of July 5, 1947, P. L. 1358, \u00a72, 25 P.S. \u00a72936 (Supp. 1962). Section 976 contains a similar restriction with regard to the acceptance of nomination petitions.\nThe sole exception under section 976 is where a nomination petition is presented for the office of judge of a court of record.\n\u201cNominations by a political body are not forbidden; they are expressly allowed as long as the candidate is not also a candidate of a political party or another political body.\u201d Brown v. Finnegan, 8 Pa. D. & C. 2d 780, 786, aff\u2019d per curiam, 389 Pa. 609, 133 A. 2d 809 (1957). (Emphasis supplied.)\nSince we hold that Paekrall was eligible for nomination, we need not consider whether Packrall\u2019s ineligibility would also invalidate the nomination of Jones.'\nAppellees also assert that the \u201cGood Government Party\u201d does not represent a political philosophy but is merely a mechanism to further the political ambitions of Paekrall. Suffice it to say that the Pennsylvania Election Code does not contemplate a judicial investigation into the political philosophy of political bodies so long as their purpose is not the forceful overthrow of the government."}
