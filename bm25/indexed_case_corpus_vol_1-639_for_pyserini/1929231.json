{"id": "1929231", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nJoseph McKeiver and Edward Terry are juvenile delinquents, having acquired that status upon findings by the Juvenile Court of Philadelphia that each had violated a law of the Commonwealth. The Superior Court affirmed the adjudications per curiam and we granted allocatur. Their consolidated appeals raise a single question: whether there is a constitutional right to a jury trial in juvenile court.\nAppellants argue that the Constitution of the United States, especially as interperited by In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1428 (1967) and Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 1444 (1968), gives them the right to insist on a jury trial. We cannot agree.\nFor over sixty-five years the Supreme Court gave no consideration at all to the constitutional problems involved in the juvenile court area. Then came the landmark decision in In re Gault The decision is somewhat of a paradox, being both broad and narrow at the same time. It is broad in that it evidences a fundamental and far-reaching disillusionment with the anticipated benefits of the juvenile court system: \u201c [T]he highest motives and most enlightened impulses led to a peculiar system for juveniles, unknown to our law in any comparable context. The constitutional and theoretical basis for this peculiar system is\u2014to say the least\u2014debatable. And in practice, as we remarked in the Kent ease, supra, the results have not been entirely satisfactory. Juvenile Court history has again demonstrated that unbridled discretion, however benevolently motivated, is frequently a poor substitute for principle and procedure. . . . The absence of substantive standards has not necessarily meant that children receive careful, compassionate, individualized treatment. The absence of procedural rules based upon constitutional principle has not always produced fair, efficient, and effective procedures. Departures from established principles of due process have frequently re-suited not in enlightened procedure, but in arbitrariness.\u201d\nContinuing to paint with a broad brush, the Court announced its intention to require that the juvenile courts function with \u201cthe procedural regularity and the exercise of care implied in the phrase \u2018due process.\u2019 \u201d At this point, however, the Court narrowed the focus of its decision and quoted from its earlier holding in Kent, saying: \u201c \u2018We do not mean ... to indicate that the hearing to be held must conform with all of the requirements of a criminal trial or even of the usual administrative hearing; but we do hold that the hearing must measure up to the essentials of due process and fair treatment.\u2019 We reiterate this view, here in conjunction with a juvenile court adjudication of \u2018delinquency,\u2019 as a requirement which is part of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of our Constitution.\u201d\nThe Court then specifically enumerated four due process rights which it held applicable in juvenile proceedings: (1) the right to adequate and timely notice of the charges; (2) the right to counsel; (8) the right to confrontation and cross-examination; and (4) the privilege against self-incrimination. Additionally, a majority of the Court specifically declined to rule on two other rights; the right to a transcript and the right to appellate review.\nAs can be seen from the quoted language, we are confronted with a sweeping rationale and a carefully tailored holding. If we had only ithe broader language it would be difficult to resist the conclusion that the Supreme Court had concluded that juvenile courts must comply with all the requirements of due process. The holdings do not, however, seem to contemplate so large a result, and our task is to decide whether the right to a jury trial ought to be operative in the juvenile court under the reasoning of Kent and Gault or under our own reading of the Constitution.\nAppellants argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s 1968 decision in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 88 S. Ct. 1444 (1968), is useful in the quest for a determination of what ought to be included in the bundle of due process rights properly applicable in juvenile courts. The Supreme Court there held that the \u201cFourteenth Amendment guarantees a right of jury trial in all criminal cases which\u2014were they to be tried in a federal court\u2014 would come within the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee.\u201d Again, the Court spoke in sweeping language, calling the right to trial by jury fundamental to our system of justice, and installed the right to a jury trial as one of those protections in the Bill of Rights which is fully applicable as a restraint on state conduct.\nBut Duncan also contained language which indicates that the ruling is not necessarily controlling here. In a discussion of the proper standards for \u201cincorporation,\u201d the Court indicated that a new standard had been operating in recent cases. No longer was the inquiry to focus on whether some civilized system of justice could be constructed without utilization of a particular safeguard. Realizing that every state in the union operated under highly similar versions of the Anglo-American common law system, the Court declared that incorporation was appropriate whenever a particular procedure was fundamental to this kind of a legal system\u2014\u201cwhether, that is, a procedure is necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered'Miberty.\u201d The Court then enumerated those protections in the Bill of Rights which had recently been made applicable to the states, and concluded that of each \u201cit might be said that the limitation in question is not necessarily fundamental to fairness in every criminal system that might be imagined but is fundamental in the context of the criminal processes maintained by the American States.\u201d Referring specifically to the right to trial by jury, the Court stated that a \u201ccriminal process which was fair and equitable but used no juries is easy to imagine. It would make use of alternative guarantees and protections which would serve the purposes that the jury serves in the English and American system.\u201d\nIn addition to the above stated restriction on the absolutism of Duncan, we must also consider the narrower portions of Gault\u2019s holdings, remembering that the Supreme Court specifically refused to apply the totality of the due process procedural safeguards to juvenile courts. Keeping these restrictions in mind, we can now determine whether the right to a trial by jury is \u201cfundamental\u201d in the context of our juvenile courts, within the meaning of Duncan.\nIn seeking to answer this question, we must recognize that the due process procedural safeguards which Gault specifically made applicable to juvenile courts have already caused a significant \u201cconstitutional domestication\u201d of juvenile court proceedings. The right to adequate and timely notice, the right to counsel, the right of confrontation and cross-examination, and the privilege against self-incrimination serve to eliminate much of the danger of arbitrariness. Further, we are confident that juveniles also enjoy the right to have a transcript of the hearing, the right of appellate review, and the right to be declared delinquent only upon evidence which demonstrates that the facts upon which the declaration is made are true beyond a reasonable doubt. Together these rights insure that the juvenile court will operate in an atmosphere which is orderly enough to impress the juvenile with the gravity of the situation and the impartiality of the tribunal and at the same time informal enough to permit the benefits of the juvenile system to operate.\nThe proper inquiry, then, is whether the right to a trial by jury is \u201cfundamental\u201d within the meaning of Duncan, in the context of a juvenile court which operates with all of the above constitutional safeguards. Since the Supreme Court felt that the right was \u201cfundamental\u201d in the context of the normal criminal process, which also operates with all of these safeguards, it is our view that the answer to our inquiry turns upon whether there are elements in the juvenile process which render the right to a trial by jury less essential to the protection of an accused\u2019s rights in the juvenile' system than in the normal criminal process, and therefore not so \u201cfundamental\u201d as to be constitutionally required.\nWe believe that such factors do inhere in the juvenile system. First, we believe that the judges in the juvenile courts do take a different view of their role than that taken by their counterparts in the criminal courts. We fully realize that this faith in the quality of the juvenile bench is not an entirely satisfactory substitute for due process, and we certainly do not rely heavily on this essentially subjective factor; but on the other hand we do not choose to ignore such considerations, and will not deprive them of all weight.\nSecond, the juvenile system has available and utilizes much more fully various diagnostic and rehabilitative services. And although the experts are not nearly so numerous as one might hope, they still provide the juvenile courts with services specially designed to aid minors, which are far superior to those available in the regular criminal process. It is the opportunities for progress offered by this area which constitute the single best reason for preserving the juvenile system. Properly operated, the juvenile system is capable of giving understanding and sympathetic treatment for each juvenile by providing the correctional, rehabilitative and instructional attention appropriate to each case. Having recognized the value of this approach, it is indeed regrettable that it is as inadequately utilized as it is. In this area more than in any other, it is the false economies of today which will contribute exponentially to the waste of tomorrow. Yet a little bit of wisdom is better than none, and in the end we see this aspect of the juvenile system, underused though it may be, as constituting one of its very real strengths.\nThird, we must recognize that the end result of a declaration of delinquency is significantly different from and less onerous than a finding of criminal guilt. There is no public record of the adjudication, and its results are not admissible in subsequent legal proceedings. None of the disabilities which follow a criminal conviction attach to an adjudicated delinquent, and most importantly, the institutions to which juveniles are committed are something less than jails, for there is a greater emphasis on rehabilitation. We do not mean to say that the post-adjudication process has lived up to expectations. It has in many respects fallen far short of its goals, and its reality is far harsher than its theory. But we are not yet convinced that the current practices do not contain the seeds from which a truly appropriate system can be brought forth.\nFinally, we note that of all the possible due process rights which could be applied in the juvenile courts, the right to trial by jury is the one which would most likely be disruptive of the unique nature of the juvenile process. Utilization of the other due process rights in 'the juvenile courts will not require the judge to abandon traditional practices; the hearing can still be conducted with some flexibility and with patience and understanding. A jury trial, on the other hand, by replacing the judge as the finder of fact, would probably require substantial alteration of the traditional practices. Faced with the necessity of refereeing a contest between the state and one of its juvenile citizens, and deprived of the power of the final arbiter, the juvenile court judge would of necessity have to concern himself much more with the technicalities of proper procedure, and would have a vastly reduced capacity to guide and mold the hearings. It is our view that the procedural rights which we have held applicable in the juvenile process will give the juveniles sufficient protection, and there is no need to add an element, the right to a trial by jury, which might well destroy the traditional character of juvenile proceedings.\nAs must be obvious by this time, we are confident that a properly structured and fairly administered juvenile court system can serve our present societal needs without infringing on individual freedoms. It is this confidence which, as much as anything else, has led us to the conclusion we reach today. Until such a time as we are disabused of our belief that the potential for growth inherent in the juvenile system will not be ignored, we hold that the juvenile courts in this Commonwealth, if conducted in accordance with the procedural safeguards set forth in this opinion, are not constitutionally compelled to grant their constituency the right to a trial by jury.\nOrders affirmed.\nIn May of 1968 appellant Joseph McKeiver, then sixteen years old, was charged with robbery, larceny and receiving stolen goods in a juvenile delinquency petition. The essence of the charge was that he and some twenty or thirty other youths had taken some twenty-five cents from three young teenagers. At the time the charges were brought against him, appellant had never before been arrested and had a record of gainful employment.\nWhen MeKeiver\u2019s case was caUed for trial on October 17, 1968, his counsel advised the court that he had not had an opportunity to discuss the ease with his client and was therefore unable to proceed. The court gave counsel five minutes to talk with his client and then proceeded to hear the case. Counsel requested and was denied the right to a jury trial.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s evidence consisted of the testimony of two of the three alleged victims, who gave the following narrative of events. While they and a companion were playing in Fairmount Park, they suddenly realized that they were being pursued by some twenty or thirty boys on foot and by three boys on bicycles. Two of the boys who were on bicycles remained at a distance whUe the third approached the three victims. What the small army of robbers on foot did at this point is unclear, but the remaining boy on a bicycle demanded money. One of the three victims refused, was punched and gave the thief a quarter. The bandit then rode off and the three victims were taken to a park guard station by a passing motorist where, after a few minutes of preliminary questioning, the two witnesses' were placed in a patrol car and taken for a ride around the area. Within minutes the two victims spotted someone whom they thought was the boy who robbed them\u2014 that person turned out to be Joseph McKeiver.\nThe testimony given by the two alleged victims at the hearing was weak. One described the robbery as a gang effort while the other testified that the thief acted alone. Both stated that the robber did not have on glasses, but McKeiver has worn them since childhood. One testified that the robber gave his bicycle to another md that the robber rode a bicycle away from the robbery, and was riding one when arrested. Both said that the robber rode a bicycle throughout the event, and yet one stated that he identified the robber by his distinctive walk.\nAfter the evidence was given, counsel for McKeiver made an argument to the trial judge similar to that usually made to a jury; the story of the alleged victims was incredible, the eyewitness identification of children is unreliable, and the facts had not been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge was apparently unimpressed by these efforts; he found McKeiver to be a \u201cdelinquent child\u201d and placed him on probation. McKeiver applied for a rehearing alleging that the court had erred in refusing him the right to a trial by jury. The petition was denied and the Superior Court affirmed per ev/riam, without opinion.\nEdward Terry was adjudged a juvenile delinquent on March 27, 1969, in proceedings initiated by petition. The evidence tended to show that one Officer Sweeney, of the Park Guard, happened upon a fight in the park and that when he ordered the combatants to break up, two of the observers to the fight hit him with fists and with a stick. Sweeney was apparently not injured. Later that same day Sweeney saw the two boys who had attacked him. Sweeney ordered them to halt, which they did. Apparently Sweeney then grabbed Terry about the neck, but he escaped and ran away. The nest day Sweeney again saw Terry on the street and, after a chase, caught and arrested him. Terry testified that Sweeney beat him at the time of the arrest.\nTerry\u2019s case'was first called on January 20, 1969. At that time counsel for Terry indicated that he wished to have a jury trial and the matter was continued. The hearing was finally held on March 27, 1969, at which time counsel for Terry reiterated his request for a jury trial, which was denied. Terry was found to be a delinquent and was committed to the Youth Development Center at Cornwells Heights.\n\u201c(4) The words \u2018delinquent child\u2019 include: (a) A child who has violated any law of the Commonwealth or ordinance of any city, borough or township; . . .\u201d Act of June 2, 1933, P.

Until March 21, 1966, the Supreme Court had never passed upon the legality of juvenile court procedures or of police practices respecting juveniles.\u201d Paulsen, Kent v.

Ct. at 1443.\n\u201c[Tjhere is another observation worth making. Informal methods relying on kindness, expertise, and discretion are most acceptable in contexts of trust. If nearly everyone in a community shares a common faith in institutions, and in the generally prevailing goals, safeguards designed to protect against abuse will not seem so important. . . . [But] this is not the situation in the crisis-ridden cities of today. . . . Divisions in the urban community are deep. Formal procedure, to some extent may be able to dispel mistrust. A judge who is supplied with specific rules regarding the fundamentals of fairness and who follows them may lessen the tensions that both he and the respondents feel. The adversary system that many see as a machine to sow discord does give the dispossessed a voice, and a time and place to be heard, and may offer a sense of participation in the decision-mating that may affect respondents mightily.
