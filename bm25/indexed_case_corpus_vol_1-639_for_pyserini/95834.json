For the reasons that follow, we hold that Mrs. Miletti was entitled to fatal claim benefits; thus, we reverse the decision of the Commonwealth Court.\nMrs. Miletti is the widow of Cresente Miletti (Decedent). Decedent was a firefighter for Appellee City of McKeesport. Decedent had worked for the City for thirty years before retiring on August 31, 1983. On February 25, 1993, Decedent passed away. Thereafter, Mrs. Miletti filed a fatal claim petition, pursuant to the Act, on September 27, 1993. In her petition, Mrs. Miletti alleged that Decedent suffered and died from interstitial lung disease (ILD) as a result of his employment as a firefighter. The City of McKeesport denied the allegations and the parties proceeded to a hearing before a workers\u2019 compensation judge.\nAt the hearing, Decedent\u2019s physician, Dr. Rahat M. Chaudhry, who is board certified in internal medicine, presented deposition testimony, credited by the workers\u2019 compensation judge, that he began treating Decedent on July 24, 1986 for ILD. In Dr. Chaudhry\u2019s opinion, the ILD was caused by on-the-job inhalation of heat, soot, chemicals, and asbestos and which, in turn, caused Decedent\u2019s death. The workers\u2019 compensation judge further found that on January 13, 1993, Mrs. Miletti\u2019s counsel first notified the City of McKeesport that only as of December 7, 1992, did Dr. Chaudhry identify the cause of Decedent\u2019s chronic respiratory problems as being work-related.\nThe workers\u2019 compensation judge granted the fatal claim petition for death from work-related lung disease. Before the workers\u2019 compensation judge, the City of McKeesport argued that Mrs. Miletti had failed to establish that Decedent\u2019s disability arose within 300 weeks of Decedent\u2019s last date of occupational exposure as required by section 301(c)(2) of the Act. 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2). However, the workers\u2019 compensation judge rejected this argument and held that Mrs. Miletti had produced unequivocal and credible medical testimony that Decedent was disabled as a result of ILD prior to July 24, 1986 (the date he first received treatment by his physician). Because this date fell within 300 weeks following Decedent\u2019s retirement in August 1983, Decedent established a compensable disability and satisfied the requirements of section 301(c)(2). The Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board (Board) affirmed. The Commonwealth Court, en banc, reversed the order of the Board. The court determined that Mrs. Miletti failed to meet the limitations for instituting a fatal claim petition under section 301(c)(2) because Decedent did not file a claim for benefits during his lifetime and his date of death was more than 300 weeks from his last date of employment.\nAs noted above, we granted allocatur to address whether the Commonwealth Court erred in reversing the workers\u2019 compensation judge\u2019s decision, granting Mrs. Miletti\u2019s fatal claim petition, on the basis that Mrs. Miletti failed to satisfy the mandates of section 301(c)(2) of the Act.\nThe relevant section of the Act provides that:\nThe terms \u201cinjury,\u201d \u201cpersonal injury,\u201d and \u201cinjury arising in the course of his employment,\u201d as used in this act, shall include, unless the context clearly requires otherwise, occupational disease as defined in section 108 of this act: Provided, That whenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, it shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment in an occupation or industry to which he was exposed to hazards of such disease: And provided further, That if the employe\u2019s compensable disability has occurred within such period, his subsequent death as a result of the disease shall likewise be compensable.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2)(emphasis supplied).\nThe Commonwealth Court interpreted this provision of the Act and determined that Mrs. Miletti was not entitled to fatal claim benefits. In reaching its conclusion, the Commonwealth Court relied upon its decision in Fortely v. WCAB (J & L Steel Corporation (Buckeye)), 117 Pa.Cmwlth. 356, 543 A.2d 1248 (1988). In Fortely, the Commonwealth Court reviewed section 301(c)(2) and found that this section barred an occupational disease death benefit claim where the decedent had not filed a disability claim during his or her lifetime, and the date of death was more than 300 weeks from the last date of employment. Thus, the Fo'rtely court\u2019s focus in interpreting section 301(c)(2) was on whether a lifetime claim petition was filed and when death occurred.\nIn the case sub judice, the Commonwealth Court found that Decedent did not seek benefits for his occupational disease during his lifetime. Thus, based upon Fortely, the Commonwealth Court determined that Mrs. Miletti was required to establish that Decedent\u2019s death occurred within 300 weeks after his last date of employment. As Decedent died over ten years after his retirement as a firefighter, a period in excess of 300 weeks, the Commonwealth Court concluded that Ms. Miletti was not entitled to an award of fatal claim benefits.\nWe find that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s analysis is inconsistent with the plain language of section 301(c)(2). Based upon the explicit language of the statute, it becomes clear that the proper focal point is whether the decedent\u2019s disability occurred within three hundred weeks of exposure. The Commonwealth Court erroneously concentrated on when death occurred and whether a lifetime disability claim was filed. By doing so, the court failed to give meaning to the express words of the legislature.\nThe rales of statutory construction require that when the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of the statute is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(b). The meaning of the words of the statute is unmistakable. Section 301(c)(2) specifically permits fatal claim benefits so long as the disability occurred within 300 weeks of exposure.\nIndeed, as Judge Alexander F. Barbieri (now deceased) explains in his venerable treatise on workers\u2019 compensation:\nif \u2018the employee\u2019s compensable disability has occurred within such period, his subsequent death as a result of the disease shall likewise be compensable.\u2019 The effect of this is that, if the disability occurs within the 300 weeks\u2019 period, the employee\u2019s death thereafter, no matter how long after, even if beyond the period of 300 weeks, is compensable because the disease was compensable during the employee\u2019s lifetime.\nPennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation and Occupational Disease, \u00a7 7.32(2)(Bisel 1999). Contrary to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s analysis, the statute\u2019s mandate is clear: if a disability occurs within 300 weeks of exposure, an employee\u2019s subsequent death is compensable. See Penn Steel Foundry and Machine Co. v. WCAB (Wagner), 122 Pa.Cmwlth. 171, 551 A.2d 653 (1988).\nA second rule of statutory construction leads us to the same conclusion. The rules of statutory construction require that every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all of its provisions. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a). As noted above, the critical language for purposes of this appeal is that if the employee\u2019s \u201ccompensable disability had occurred \"within such period, his subsequent death as a result of the disease shall likewise be compensable.\u201d 77 P.S. 411(2). This statement by the General Assembly is rendered meaningless and is superfluous unless one interprets it to apply only to deaths occurring beyond the 300 week period. The situation where death occurs within the 300 week period is already addressed by the preceding sentence:\nwhenever occupational disease is the basis for compensation, for disability or death under this act, it shall apply only to disability or death resulting from such disease and occurring within three hundred weeks after the last date of employment in an occupation or industry to which he was exposed to hazards of such disease.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2).\nAs demonstrated by reading these sentences, the time of death and the filing of a lifetime claim petition are irrelevant to a determination of the timeliness of a fatal claim petition. Again, it is whether disability occurred within 300 weeks of exposure.\nIn the case sub judice, the evidence, as found by the finder of fact, establishes that Decedent was disabled as a result of work-related interstitial fibrosis prior to July 1986. As this date falls within the 300 week period following Decedent\u2019s last date of employment, i.e., the date of his last occupational exposure, his widow, Mrs. Miletti, is entitled to benefits pursuant to 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(2).\nJustice NIGRO files a dissenting opinion in which Justice ZAPPALA and Justice NEWMAN join.\n. The opinion was reassigned to this author.\n. The workers' compensation judge\u2019s Finding of Fact No. 6(a), based upon Decedent\u2019s physician\u2019s testimony, described ILD as follows:\n[A] progressive and terminal disorder wherein the normal lung tissues are displaced by fibrous tissue and as a consequence lose the ability to expand properly. There are many known causes of ILD, including exposure to noxious materials such as soot, asbestos, metals, chemicals, coal, pesticides, and molds, as well as a pre-existing history of systematic diseases such as lupus and arthritis.\n. Specifically, the workers' compensation judge accepted as credible the testimony of Dr. Chaudhry, that he began treating Decedent in 1986 for ILD. Dr. Chaudhry initially believed decedent\u2019s condition to be idiopathic in nature, and thus, did not discern a causal relationship between Decedent\u2019s work and his disease. However, he subsequently changed his opinion. The workers\u2019 compensation judge credited Dr. Chaudhry\u2019s opinion that Decedent\u2019s lung disease and subsequent death were caused by occupational inhalation of heat, soot, chemicals and asbestos, and credited Dr. Chaudhiy's testimony that he told Decedent that his disease was work-related on December 7, 1992. The judge also accepted as credible the testimony of Decedent\u2019s fellow firefighter of twenty years, Albert Cipicchio, that Decedent was exposed to burning rubber, plastic wiring and asbestos, and that the City of McKeesport provided masks which restricted breathing, and therefore, were not usable. The judge found that Decedent passed away on February 25, 1993 and concluded that his death was caused by a compensable disability.\n. Appellate review of a Commonwealth agency determination is limited. The court shall affirm the adjudication of a Commonwealth agency unless it finds that the adjudication is in violation of constitutional rights, is not in accordance with law, is violative of the practices and procedure of the Commonwealth agency, or any findings of fact made by the agency and necessary to support its adjudication are not supported by substantial evidence. 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 704; Wilson v. W.C.A.B. (Alcoa), 542 Pa. 614, 669 A.2d 338, 340 (1996).\n. Three hundred weeks is the equivalent of five years, nine months and one week.\n. To the extent that ihe Commonwealth Court's decision in Fortely is inconsistent with our decision today, it is hereby rejected.\n. A separate question arises whether section 301(c)(2) would permit death benefits to be awarded in a situation where a claim based upon disability occurring within 300 weeks would not meet the procedural or substantive requirements of the Act as of the time the death claim is filed. In such circumstances, it is arguable that the disability is not \u201ccompensable'' for purposes of section 301(c)(2). For example, the issue would present itself in a case in which, prior to the employee\u2019s death, the three-year limitation period for the filing of a claim petition imposed by section 315 of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 602, expired without a lifetime claim having been filed, and where it is established that the employee was informed of the work-related nature of his disease. In the case at bar, although Decedent did not file a lifetime claim within three years after he suffered total disability, this court has held that the three-year period does not commence until such time as the employee is apprised by competent medical diagnosis that his disability is due to occupational disease. See Price v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd. (Metallurgical Resources), 533 Pa. 500, 626 A.2d 114, 117 (1993). Here, Decedent did not receive such diagnosis until December 1992, and the fatal claim petition was filed within one year\u2019s time thereafter. Thus, section 315 is no impediment to the death claim, and the City of McKeesport has not suggested that the Act otherwise bars the underlying claim for disability."}
