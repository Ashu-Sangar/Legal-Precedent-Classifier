{"id": "551796", "contents": "Mr. Justice Trunkey\ndelivered the opinion of the court March 21st, 1887.\nThe language of the will must be interpreted according to its proper acceptation, or with as near approach to that acceptation, as the context and state of the circumstances existing at the time of its execution will admit. A mistake in the wilL cannot be corrected, unless it clearly appears by fair inference from the whole. In this court the appellant has not contended that parol evidence is admissible of the actual intention of the testator for the purpose of controlling or influencing the construction of his will.\nThis will contains seven \u201citems,\u201d and only the fifth contains no bequest to the testator\u2019s wife. He first bequeaths to her all his personal estate, except a specified portion. The second and fourth items contain devises of real estate, each \u201c subject to the payment of the sum of one hundred and twenty-five dollars per annum unto my widow, Catharine, for and during the term ,of her natural life.\u201d In the third item real estate is devised to William Hellerman, \u201c subject to the payment of the sum of one hundred and twenty-five dollars unto my widow, Catharine, for and during all the term of her natural life.\u201d In the sixth item the testator provides that in case his daughter Caroline should die before his widow, that his widow shall have the rents and profits of certain land \u201cduring the term\u2019of her natural life.\u201d And in the seventh item the testator devises his homestead farm, subject to the right of his widow, Catharine, to reside on the same \u201c during the term of her natural life,\u201d and to receive'one third of the rents and profits \u201c during her life.\u201d\nAfter having made five annual payments of one hundred and twenty-five dollars to the widow, the appellant discovered that the words \u201cper annum\u201d had been omitted in the clause creating the charge on the land devised to him. Being interested, he naturally inferred that the words in said clause, \u201cduring all the term of her natural life,\u201d were meaningless, though so often used in their proper sense in other parts of the will where money and rents are directed to be paid to her during said period. That he did not sooner discover the omission is not surprising. It seems plain that he took the land, subject to an annual payment during the life of the widow.\nThe testator used apt words to express his intention, and the several devises, subject to annual payments to the widow, are in similar phrase as respects the duration of the charge. Had the testator intended to charge one devise with a single small payment, he would have simply directed its payment to his widow, and not have repeated that phrase, omitting a word, thereby rendering the phrase senseless. It is a fair inference from the whole will that the words \u201c per annum\u201d were omitted from said clause by mistake.\nIt is unnecessary to repeat the reference to the authorities, made by the Master and court below, which establish the principle that a word may be supplied when it is a clear inference from the whole will that it Avas omitted by mistake.\nDecree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at costs of the appellant."}
