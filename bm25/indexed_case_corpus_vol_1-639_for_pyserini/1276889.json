{"id": "1276889", "contents": "\u25a0Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThe judgment of the court below is affirmed on the following opinion of President Judge Bok :\n\u201cPlaintiff sued his employer\u2019s compensation carrier: (1) for breach of his statutory duty to provide him with proper medical care, (2) for breach of its agent\u2019s promise to provide him with proper medical care, and (3) for negligently breaching its duty to provide him with proper medical care.\n\u201cPlaintiff first suffered a sprained- ankle, and after gangrene developed, the leg had to be amputated. He asserts that defendant\u2019s failure to provide medical care was the cause.\n\u201cDefendant filed preliminary objections.\n\u201cPlaintiffs sued once before, eodem nomine, at Common Pleas Court No. 7, September Term, 1955, No. 716, on the theory that defendant\u2019s failure to provide medical care was malpractice, a tort independent of the original injury. Judge Sloans sustained preliminary objections and was affirmed by the Supreme Court- in 385 Pennsylvania 464 (1956).\n\u201cThe only difference between the suit' in Common Pleas No. 7 and the instant suit is that counts in assumpsit have been added, the theory now being that defendant breached a contract to provide proper medical care. All three counts of the complaint, however, are expressly founded upon the compensation insurance.\n\u201cWe think that the effort to shift from trespass to assumpsit does not change the situation. The contract that plaintiff seeks to invoke cannot be set up apart from the insurance contract, upon which it depends.\n\u201cAs the Supreme Court said, at page 467: \u2018Thus, the appellant pleads the defendant\u2019s breach of' a gratuitous promise and nothing more. . . . The defendant company\u2019s sole liability to the appellant is under its policy of compensation insurance which it issued \"to the appellant\u2019s employer.\u2019 (Italics ours.)\n\u201cThe preliminary objections are sustained and judgment is entered for the defendant.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents."}
