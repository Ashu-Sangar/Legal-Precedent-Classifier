State Ethics Comm\u2019n, 555 Pa. 149, 723 A.2d 174 (1999), that attorneys may be regulated by the State Ethics Commission as part of a class which includes non-lawyers? Did the lower court exceed the bounds of appellate jurisdiction and act contrary to longstanding judicial precedent\u2014 including its own \u201con point\u201d ruling \u2014 by entertaining this matter as an appeal from an advisory opinion?"}
