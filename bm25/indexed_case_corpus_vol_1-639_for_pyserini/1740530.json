{"id": "1740530", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, Charles H. Lawson, a/k/a Charles H. Lawson El, was convicted at a bench trial of murder of the first degree. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. This direct appeal followed.\nThe facts are as follows. At approximately 10:30 p.m., on July 27, 1974, Arthur Lewis was shot in front of his aunt\u2019s home at 1335 Rodman Street in Philadelphia. The victim\u2019s aunt, Lily Purnell, testified that she heard what sounded like two loud firecrackers. She went to the window of her home and saw Lewis lying on the ground. She noticed a young black man riding a bicycle at a fast rate of speed away from the scene of the shooting.\nOfficer Bernard Brosuski of the Philadelphia police department was in his patrol car on Rodman Street when he heard what he believed were two gunshots. When Officer Brosuski saw two black youths leaving the scene on bicycles, going very fast, he turned his car around and followed the pair. When the bicyclists split up, Officer Brosuski followed appellant and eventually caught up with him. When appellant was arrested, he was on his knees on the ground in a vacant lot. After appellant was taken away in a police wagon, Brosuski returned to the 1300 block of Rodman Street and determined that a shooting had occurred. He then went to the location of appellant\u2019s arrest and found a gun loosely buried in the dirt. The victim died two days later as a result of the gunshot wounds.\nAppellant, a seventeen-year-old minor, arrived at the Police Administration Building at 10:55 p.m. Detective James Richardson attempted to contact appellant\u2019s stepfather, but was unsuccessful originally. At 12 Midnight, appellant was given his constitutional rights, which he allegedly waived. Appellant then gave an inculpatory statement, telling police that he shot the victim to avenge the shooting of a friend.\nDuring this time, police were able to contact appellant\u2019s stepfather, who told police he would go to the stationhouse. Appellant\u2019s stepfather and sister arrived at 4:25 a.m., and were allowed to confer with appellant for approximately thirty minutes. Following this consultation, appellant reiterated his confession, making a few minor changes. Both confessions were introduced at trial.\nAppellant first argues that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction of murder of the first degree. We do not agree.\nIn Commonwealth v. Rose, 463 Pa. 264, 267-68, 344 A.2d 824, 825-26 (1975), we stated:\n\u201cThe test of sufficiency of the evidence is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and drawing the proper inferences favorable to the Commonwealth, the trier of fact could reasonably have found that all of the elements of the crime had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, it is the province of the trier of fact to pass upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence produced. . . . The fact-finder is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence.\u201d (Citations omitted.)\nThe evidence presented at trial meets this standard in showing that this killing was \u201cwillful, deliberate and premeditated. . . . \u201d Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(a).\nAppellant next asserts that the suppression court erred in refusing to suppress the two confessions. He argues that since he was not afforded an opportunity to confer with an interested adult, his waiver of the Miranda rights was ineffectual, thus requiring suppression of the first confession. Further, since the second confession was taken without either explaining the applicable rights to appellant\u2019s stepfather or rewarning appellant in his stepfather\u2019s presence, appellant believes that statement should also be suppressed. We agree with appellant as to both confessions and grant him a new trial.\nIn Commonwealth v. McCutchen, 463 Pa. 90, 343 A.2d 669 (1975), we articulated a rule which held that any waiver of Miranda rights by a juvenile would be ineffectual unless the juvenile had the opportunity to consult with an interested and informed adult before waiving the Miranda rights. Furthermore, in Commonwealth v. Chaney, 465 Pa. 407, 350 A.2d 829 (1975), we held that even though a defendant\u2019s arrest, confession and trial predated our decisions in Commonwealth v. McCutchen, supra; Commonwealth v. Starkes, 461 Pa. 178, 335 A.2d 698 (1975); and Commonwealth v. Roane, 459 Pa. 389, 329 A.2d 286 (1974), any defendant whose case was on direct appeal at the time of those decisions was entitled to their benefit, provided the issue was properly preserved. As appellant was never given such an opportunity for consideration, our McCutchen decisions require suppression of the first confession.\nThe Commonwealth advances three reasons why our McCutchen decisions should not be applicable. The Commonwealth first argues that appellant has waived the issue because of a lack of specificity in his suppression motion. The Commonwealth would have us hold the issue waived merely because the suppression motion contained no mention that appellant was a juvenile. We believe appellant\u2019s suppression motion was sufficient to preserve this issue for our review.\nFirst, and most important, the suppression motion in this case was filed one month before we announced our decision in Roane, supra. A general claim of ineffective waiver of Miranda rights is sufficient to preserve this juvenile confession issue. See Commonwealth v. Walker, 477 Pa. 370, 383 A.2d 1253 (1978). Compare Commonwealth v. Baylis, 477 Pa. 472, 384 A.2d 1185 (1978).\nIn his motion to suppress, appellant did allege:\n1. The Commonwealth secured statements, both oral and written, which were in violation of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights.\n2. The defendant was never warned of his constitutional rights and never waived them in a knowing, intelligent and voluntary manner.\nThe Commonwealth next argues that our decision in Commonwealth v. Hart, 471 Pa. 271, 370 A.2d 298 (1977) renders admission of the confession harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree.\nIn Hart, we held that introduction of an otherwise illegal confession can be rendered harmless if the defendant took the stand and reiterated the confession. Here, however, appellant did not reiterate his confession, for his trial testimony substantially differed from both confessions. In the confessions, appellant told police the killing was motivated by revenge and he did the shooting. At trial, appellant\u2019s testimony indicated that he went along out of fear of gang pressure and that he did not fire the gun. The substantial differences between the confessions and appellant\u2019s trial testimony render Hart inapposite.\nThe Commonwealth also argues that the mandate in Commonwealth v. Futch, 447 Pa. 389, 290 A.2d 417 (1972), required the questioning of appellant before his stepfather arrived. We do not agree. In Futch, this court, in interpreting Pa.R.Crim.P. 118 (now 130) determined that any evidence obtained during a period of \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d between arrest and arraignment was inadmissible at trial if such evidence was reasonably related to the unnecessary delay. The Futch court did not create an exclusionary rule for evidence obtained during periods of necessary delay. We believe that a reasonable delay attributable to waiting for the parents of a juvenile defendant under the McCutchen holding is \u201cnecessary delay\u201d under the Futch rationale. We therefore reject the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that Futch mandated noncompliance with McCutchen.\nAs the Commonwealth\u2019s arguments concerning the inapplicability of McCutchen are unpersuasive, we are convinced appellant\u2019s original confession must be suppressed. Again, this is so because appellant\u2019s waiver of his Miranda rights was ineffectual. We believe the second confession must also be suppressed because appellant was never re-warned of his rights. The Commonwealth states that appellant\u2019s father was told of his son\u2019s rights, but our review of the record reveals no such fact. As the original waiver was ineffectual with no rewarnings, appellant\u2019s second confession must also be suppressed.\nJudgment of sentence reversed and new trial ordered.\nMANDERINO, J., files a concurring opinion.\nNIX, J., concurs in the result.\nPOMEROY, J., files a dissenting opinion in which EAG-EN, C. J., joins.\nPACKEL, J., took no part in the decision of this case.\n. Appellant\u2019s arrest and confession predated our decision in Roane, supra. Further, appellant\u2019s suppression motion was filed approximately one month before Roane."}
