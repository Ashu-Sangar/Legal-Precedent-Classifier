{"id": "1047534", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe learned auditing judge concluded with some hesitation that the word \u201cchildren\u201d as used by the testatrix in making provision for her daughter, Mary Lilly G. Beall, included a grandchild of the daughter. This was approved by the court in banc. The will of Clement B. Grubb, the husband of the testatrix, must be read into her will in determining what she intended by \u201cchildren,\u201d for her words are \u201cAll monies, stock, bonds and mortgages, I bequeath to my daughter Mary Lilly G. Beall I leave in the same strict Trust, as my husband appointed in his will, for my daughter Mary Lilly G. Beall, and after her death to be divided equally, in the same Trust, among Mrs. Beall\u2019s three daughters, or more, should there be more children at the time of Mrs. Beall\u2019s death.\u201d The trust for Mrs. Beall was to be the \u201csame strict trust\u201d as was created for her by her father, and, upon her death, was to be divided \u201cin the same trust.\u201d Turning to the will of the father there is found the express direction in his provision for Mrs. Beall that upon her death the descendants of any one of her children who might die before her should take the deceased child\u2019s share, \u201cper stirpes, upon the principle of representation.\u201d As the testatrix clearly indicated her intention that the trust which she created for her daughter should be \u201cin the same strict trust\u201d......\u201cto be divided in the same trust\u201d as was established by her husband, we have no doubt as to the correctness of the conclusion reached by the court below.\nAppeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
