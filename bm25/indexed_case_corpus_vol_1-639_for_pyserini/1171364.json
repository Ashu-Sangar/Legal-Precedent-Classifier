Securities Commission, 298 U. S. 1, 16; Easton Passenger Ry. Co. v. Easton, 133 Pa. 505, 521; Clark v. Martin, 49 Pa. 289; Cooke v. Boynton, 135 Pa. 102; Whiteman v. Fayette Fuel-Gas Co., 139 Pa. 492. \u201cEquity . . . will not allow itself to be baffled by a wrongful change while its aid is being invoked. The modern cases . . . have established the rule that the status quo which will be preserved . . . is the last actual, peaceable, noncontested status which preceded the pending controversy, and [it] will not permit a wrongdoer to shelter himself behind a suddenly . . . changed status . . . \u201d: Fredericks v.
