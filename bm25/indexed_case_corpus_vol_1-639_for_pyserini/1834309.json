{"id": "1834309", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThe issue presented for our consideration is whether the Superior Court erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the requested defense of entrapment. For the reasons that follow we now reverse the order of the Superior Court.\nAppellant Frantz Borgella was convicted by a jury in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County on two counts of unlawful delivery of a controlled substance. Appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of eleven and one half to twenty-three months on the first count and to a concurrent term of three to six months on the second count. Post-trial motions were filed, argued and denied.\nThe facts presented at trial established that on February 8, 1987, Detective Felino of the Derry Township Police Department received a telephone call from a reliable paid informant, Tim Updegraff, whose information over approximately five years had resulted in a number of arrests. As a result of the telephone conversation, a meeting was set up for 5:30 p.m. with the informant, the detective (posing as the informant\u2019s boss and cousin), and Appellant, at a K-Mart parking lot in Hummelstown. At that meeting, the detective negotiated an agreement for purchase of drugs and paid Appellant $70.00.\nLater that evening, the detective received another call from the informant and a second meeting was arranged for 8:30 p.m. in a barbershop parking lot at the intersection of Route 743 and Gates Road. At the meeting, Appellant handed the detective two packages of substances which later were determined to be marijuana and cocaine. The detective then explored the possibility of future drug transactions with Appellant who volunteered his phone number.\nThe trial court refused to instruct the jury on the defense of entrapment because Appellant\u2019s denial of the crime was logically inconsistent with and factually repugnant to the defense of entrapment. The Superior Court affirmed the conviction on a different basis, concluding that there was insufficient evidence of entrapment for the jury to find in Appellant\u2019s favor. 399 Pa.Super. 645, 573 A.2d 1156.\nIn Commonwealth v. Weiskerger, 520 Pa. 305, 554 A.2d 10 (1989) we addressed the issue of whether defendants who did not testify at trial and who failed to admit their participation either in the crimes charged or in any of the elements of the crimes charged were nonetheless entitled to a jury instruction on entrapment. Weiskerger involved a school board member who was recruited to join a coalition of newly elected board members in exchange for the promise to intercede with the county commissioners to preserve the board members\u2019s wife\u2019s administrative position at the county nursing home. In concluding that the defendants were entitled to a jury instruction on entrapment we stated:\nA defendant is entitled to an instruction on any recognized defense which has been requested, which has been made an issue in the case, and for which there exists evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find in his or her favor. See Mathews v. United States, 485 U.S. 58, 108 S.Ct. 883, 99 L.Ed.2d 54 (1988); Commonwealth v. Carter, 502 Pa. 433, 466 A.2d 1328 (1983); Pa.R.Crim.P. Rule 1119. Moreover the entrapment statute conditions the availability of the defense only on a defendant\u2019s ability to establish its elements. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 313(b). Although it may be difficult for a fact finder to believe that a person who has denied any criminal wrongdoing was entrapped into doing a criminal act, the law of this Commonwealth does not bar a jury instruction on entrapment on the basis of a jury\u2019s potential incredulity.\n520 Pa. at 312-313, 554 A.2d at 14 (1989).\nIn relevant part, our entrapment statute provides:\nEntrapment\n(a) General rule. \u2014 A public law enforcement official or a person acting in cooperation with such an official perpetrates an entrapment if for the purpose of obtaining evidence of the commission of an offense, he induces or encourages another person to engage in conduct constituting such offense by either:\n(1) making knowingly false representations designed to induce the belief that such conduct is not prohibited; or\n(2) employing methods of persuasion or inducement which create a substantial risk that such an offense will be committed by persons other than those who are ready to commit it.\n(b) Burden of proof. \u2014 Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a person prosecuted for an offense shall be acquitted if he proves by a preponderance of evidence that his conduct occurred in response to an entrapment.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 313.\nIn Commonwealth v. Weiskerger, we held that the entrapment statute embodied an objective standard to guide a fact finder in the application of that defense. Specifically, we found that \u201c[t]he burden of proof language was merely intended to explicitly place the burden of proof on the defendant to establish the defense of entrapment as defined in subsection (a) with its language focusing objectively on the conduct of the police officers\u201d. 520 Pa. at 312, 554 A.2d at 14 (emphasis added).\nAppellant argues that his own trial testimony on the events preceding his involvement with Detective Pelino, together with his version of his conversation with Detective Pelino, establish sufficient evidence to submit the question of whether he was entrapped to the jury.\nAppellant testified that in November, 1986, three months prior to the incident in question, Timothy Updegraff appeared as a stranger at Appellant\u2019s home in Lancaster and asked to use his bathroom. After using the bathroom, Updegraff asked Appellant if he could get Updegraff some drugs. Appellant refused. Nevertheless, Updegraff persisted and subsequently returned to Appellant\u2019s house several times seeking drugs. Updegraffs ploy was to play on Appellant\u2019s sympathy by explaining that he was addicted to drugs because of domestic problems and that he could not buy drugs in appellant\u2019s neighborhood because each time he tried he was \u201cripped off\u201d and beaten. Appellant, however, continued to refuse to buy any drugs for Updegraff.\nAppellant also testified that Updegraff ingratiated himself to Appellant, and the two began to spend time together socially. During this time, Appellant, although employed, became involved in construction, Updegraffs ostensible line of work, based on Appellant\u2019s perception, created by Updegraff, of Updegraffs enviable income. Subsequently, Updegraff offered to introduce Appellant to his boss and Appellant eagerly accepted the opportunity. On February 8, 1987, Updegraff drove Appellant from his home to meet his boss (Detective Pelino) in a parking lot in Hummelstown to discuss a potential job in construction.\nApplying an objective standard to the conduct of the police, we find that there was sufficient evidence to entitle Appellant to a jury instruction on entrapment. Appellant, a law abiding citizen of this Commonwealth, was contacted by a paid police informant who through numerous false pretenses secured Appellant\u2019s confidence and friendship. Furthermore, according to Appellant\u2019s testimony, the police informant during this time repeatedly encouraged Appellant to buy drugs for him. Finally, the police informant offered Appellant a more lucrative job opportunity by introducing him to his \u201cboss\u201d, Detective Pelino in Hummelstown. It could reasonably be inferred that the sine qua non for this job opportunity was the agreement to obtain drugs for the \u201cboss\u201d.\nWe reach this conclusion based on a strong belief that [i]n their zeal to enforce the law, government agents may not originate a criminal design, implant in an innocent person\u2019s mind the disposition to commit a criminal act and then induce commission of the crime so that the government may prosecute. Jacobson v. United States, \u2014 U.S. -, 112 S.Ct. 1535, 118 L.Ed.2d 147 (1992) (Where the defense of entrapment was raised in a criminal prosecution, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the prosecution failed as a matter of law to adduce evidence to support the jury verdict that Jacobson was predisposed independent of the government\u2019s acts and beyond a reasonable doubt to violate the Child Protection Act of 1984 by receiving child pornography through the mails.)\nThe order of the Superior Court affirming the judgment of sentence of the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nPAPADAKOS, J., files a dissenting opinion in which McDermott, j., joins.\n.
