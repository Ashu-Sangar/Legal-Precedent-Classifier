{"id": "1275666", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nOn July 23, 1953 a tragic and unfortunate event occurred which has resulted in this litigation. Albert G. Kuhns, 12 years old, was wounded by a bullet from a pistol discharged by his cousin, George A. Brugger, also 12 years old, while in the cottage of their common grandfather, George W. Bach, located at Manchester Beach, Erie County, and, as a result thereof, Kuhns sustained serious physical injuries.\nThrough a guardian, Kuhns instituted a trespass action, joined in by his parents, against George Brugger; later, by permission of court, the executor of the George W. Bach Estate was joined as an additional party defendant. A motion for severance of the actions having been refused, the suit against both defendants proceeded to trial. The jury returned a verdict against both defendants in the amount of $182,-096; the Court below later reduced this amount to $116,604.60 and this reduction was accepted by plaintiffs. From a judgment entered on the verdict these appeals were perfected.\nBoth defendants have appealed, requesting judg: ments n.o.v., or, in the alternative, new trials. In considering these appeals the scope of appellate scrutiny of the evidence varies. Upon an appeal from the refusal to grant a motion for judgment n.o.v. the testimony must be read in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, all conflicts therein must be resolved in his favor, and he must be given the benefit of all facts and inferences from facts reasonably deducible from the evidence: Wolansky v. Lawson, 389 Pa. 477, 481, 133 A. 2d 843; Wilbert v. Pittsburgh Consolidated Coal Co., 385 Pa. 149, 154, 122 A. 2d 406; Lessy v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, 121 Pa. Superior Ct. 440, 444, 183 A. 657. However, this rule does not apply upon appeal from the refusal of a new trial. In determining the propriety of the refusal of a new trial the present Chief Justice Jones stated in Wilbert v. Pittsburgh Consolidated Coal Co., supra (pp. 156, 157) : \u201cPractically all of the evidence was introduced by way of oral testimony the credibility whereof was necessarily for the jury whose verdict will not be set aside as being against tbe evidence unless it appears to be arbitrary and capricious. A determination in sueb regard is, in the first instance, within the province of the trial court whose decision will not be disturbed unless there is clear error of law or palpable abuse of discretion.\u201d In determining the validity. of a refusal to enter judgment n.o.v. we examine the evidence to determine whether or not sufficient proof was adduced at the trial to justify the submission to the jury of each factual question: Ashcraft v. C. G. Hussey and Co., 359 Pa. 129, 134, 58 A. 2d 170. With these principles in mind the following factual narrative emerges.\nBach, an elderly man, owned and occupied \u2014 at least, part of each year \u2014 a one story cottage at Manchester Beach on the shore of Lake Erie. This cottage was located in a somewhat isolated area in the immediate vicinity of which were several commercial fisheries. A hunting devotee, Bach owned various guns and other firearms including the Colt Woodsman .22 calibre automatic pistol which constitutes the focal point of this incident. When this pistol was not in use Bach kept it in a loaded condition in an unlocked dresser drawer in his unlocked bedroom.\nAt approximately noon on July 23, 1953, Bach\u2019s two young grandsons, Kuhns and Brugger, went fishing; upon their return at approximately 3:30 P.M. and during Bach\u2019s absence, the boys entered their grandfather\u2019s bedroom. Katrina Brugger \u2014 Brugger\u2019s 2 year old sister \u2014 was then playing in the bedroom. In a spirit of play Brugger picked up a so-called \u201cunder and over\u201d gun \u2014 a combination shotgun and rifle \u2014 and pointed-it at Kuhns. As he did this, Miss Pries, a great aunt of the boys, entered the bedroom and ordered Brugger to put away the gun which he did. A few minutes later Brugger went to his grandfather\u2019s dresser and found in the top left drawer thereof the Colt automatic pistol, previously mentioned, which was then loaded with a clip of cartridges resting in Its handle. In order to prepare this pistol for firing one draws back an upper slide forcing a cartridge into the firing chamber and the cartridge is then exploded by pulling the trigger. There was some testimony that this pistol at the time was mechanically defective and that, on occasion, if one held his finger on the trigger as he pulled back the slide, the pistol would discharge, without the added requirement of squeezing the trigger \u2014 a one-step, rather than a two-step procedure.\nAccording to Brugger the shooting occurred in the following manner: \u201cAnd I took it [the pistol] out, took it out of the holster, took it in my hand. I believe I had my finger on the trigger. And I pulled the slide back, and then the shot occurred.\u201d The bullet, thus ejected, penetrated Kuhns\u2019 body and perforated the spinal cord, paralyzing the entire lower portion of his body and destroying all voluntary control of his organs in that part of his body. His condition, as portrayed at trial, is such that he can no longer walk, requires constant care and medication and can never be gainfully employed.\nThe defendant Brugger takes the dual position that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish any negligence on his part and that the Court below, in submitting the question of his negligence to the jury, not only held him, a minor, to the standard of conduct required of an adult, but, in effect, charged the jury that he was guilty of negligence per se in that he had violated a criminal statute. We shall first concern ourselves with Brugger\u2019s appeals.\nBrugger\u2019s contention that he is entitled to judgment n.o.v. because of the lack of sufficient evidence of negligence on his part is clearly untenable. This Court, in Fredericks v. Atlantic Refining Co., 282 Pa. 8, 13, 127 A. 615, set forth the required rule of conduct when dealing with any dangerous agency: \u201cA higher degree of care is required in dealing with a dangerous agency than in the ordinary affairs of life or business, . . . every reasonable precaution suggested by experience and the known danger ought to be taken . . .\u201d See also Maternia v. Pa. R. R. Co., 358 Pa. 149, 56 A. 2d 233; Summit Hotel Company v. National Broadcasting Company, 336 Pa. 182, 8 A. 2d 302; Konchar et al. v. Cebular, 333 Pa. 499, 3 A. 2d 913. Any loaded firearm, including a pistol, is a highly dangerous instrumentality and, since its possession or use is attended by extraordinary danger, any person having it in possession or using it is bound to exercise extraordinary care. A person handling or carrying a loaded firearm in the immediate vicinity of others is liable for its discharge, even though the discharge is accidental and unintentional, provided it is not unavoidable: Lindh v. Protective Motor Service Co., Inc., 310 Pa. 1, 4, 164 A. 605; Winans v. Randolph, 169 Pa. 606, 32 A. 622; Knasiak v. Rambo, 57 Pa. Superior Ct. 8; Gaussman v. Philadelphia & Reading Railway Co., 55 Pa. Superior Ct. 542. When a person picks up a firearm, points it at another and operates the firing mechanism, with or without the knowledge that the firearm is loaded, and the firearm is discharged, and the evidence so indicates, then a prima facie case of negligence is established.\nBrugger submits, however, that, because of his age, he was presumptively incapable of negligent conduct and therefore his conduct did not render him iiable for the injury which followed the discharge of the firearm. In short, Brugger relies upon his age to absolve him of any culpability for his actions and the manner in which the Court below instructed the jury to secure a new trial.\nEven though the standard of care applicable to a minor differs from that applicable to an adult, nevertheless a minor may be guilty of actionable negligence. Both an adult and a minor are under an obligation to exercise reasonable care; however, the \u201creasonable care\u201d required of a minor is measured by a different yardstick \u2014 it is that measure of care which other minors of like age, experience, capacity and development would ordinarily exercise under similar circumstances. In applying that yardstick, we place minors in three categories based on their ages: minors under the age of seven years are conclusively presumed incapable of negligence; minors over the age of fourteen years are presumptively capable of negligence, the burden being placed on such minors to prove their incapacity; minors between the ages of seven and fourteen years are presumed incapable of negligence, but such presumption is rebuttable and grows weaker with each year until the fourteenth year is reached. As the late Mr. Justice Allen Stearne said in Koenig v. Flaherty, 383 Pa., supra (page 190) : \u201cThe standard by which actions of children are to be measured is the child\u2019s capacity to appreciate the danger involved: Philadelphia, Baltimore and Wilmington R. R. Co. v. Layer, 112 Pa. 414, 419, 3 A. 874. This capacity is usually determined by the understanding expected from children of like age, intelligence and experience: [Citing cases].\u201d\nBrugger at the age of 12 years was not to be judged by adult standards; on the contrary, it was necessary to inquire whether his conduct was such as should reasonably have been expected of a child of like age, intelligence and experience. Brugger\u2019s culpability or exculpability of actionable negligence depended upon a measurement of his conduct based on variable factors \u2014 his capacity and understanding based upon his age, intelligence, experience, etc.: a measurement properly to be made by a jury with the opportunity to evaluate his individual capacity to perceive danger. Concerning the capability of negligent conduct of a child between the ages of seven and fourteen it has been said: \u201cGenerally their conduct has been determined by a jury. This has been because the ascertainment of the capacity to perceive danger involves the determination of judgment factors, i.e., knowledge, intelligence, experience, character of the danger, which are often associated with questions of fact and hardly ever beyond reasonable doubt . . .\u201d: 51 Dickinson L. Rev. 79, 84, 85. Whether Brugger at his age and under the circumstances had the capacity to understand, comprehend and perceive the danger and risk inherent in handling this pistol Avas most suitably a question for determination by a jury.\nWe have carefully examined the trial judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on the law applicable to the determination of Brugger\u2019s negligence and find such instructions free from error. The trial judge Avas singularly cautious in explaining to the jury the requisite standard of conduct of a 12 year old boy, the presumption in his favor and the yardstick to be applied in measuring his conduct. Appellant\u2019s complaint concerning that portion of the instructions Avhich referred to the possibility that Brugger might have violated a criminal statute in pointing the pistol at Kuhns is Avithout merit. Whoever Avantonly or playfully points a pistol at another offends against our criminal code (Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, \u00a7716, 18 PS \u00a74716) and the violation of a statute may be regarded as negligence per se (Jinks et al. v. Currie et al., 324 Pa. 532, 188 A. 356) even though the violator be a minor (D\u2019Ambrosio et al. v. Phila., 354 Pa. 403, 47 A. 2d 256). The trial judge, referring to the statute, said: \u201cNoav, I can\u2019t instruct you, as a matter of laAV, that that [the statute] applies in this case and therefore makes George Brugger negligent per se, or because of that statute, because the question as to pointing is in dispute. George Brugger says he doesn\u2019t think he pointed it. The plaintiff said he did point it. Actually, the gun Avas pointed but it is a question of intention. If George Brugger was mature enough to know better, and therefore negligent, then you may use that statute as evidence of negligence per s\u00e9, and hold him for it. If he did not point it intentionally, then your determination of his guilt will be based upon carelessness, as we have described it for you, if it existed. . . (Emphasis supplied). At the close of the charge the trial judge reiterated the standard of conduct required of a minor. We fail to find any error of commission or omission at the trial which in any manner prejudiced or harmed the defendant Brugger. The verdict of the jury against Brugger was fully warranted by the evidence and a new trial was properly refused.\nIn considering the defendant Bach Estate\u2019s motion for judgment n.o.v. we must entirely eliminate certain portions of the testimony. Under the Act of 1887, supra \u2014 applicable to trespass actions, including actions to recover damages for personal injuries \u2014 -a surviving or remaining party or any other person whose interest is adverse to one who is dead cannot testify as to matters which took place before the death if the deceased had some rights in the subject matter which have passed to a party on the record who represents his interest. Under this statutory provision the testimony of both Kuhns and Brugger must be eliminated from our consideration as it was in the Court below.\nEliminating such testimony the record reveals that the pistol was owned by Bach, that it was kept in an unlocked dresser drawer in his unlocked bedroom with a clip of cartridges in its handle, that young Brugger not only was aware of the existence of the pistol\u2014 having been shown it on several occasions by Bach\u2014 but also its place of containment in the bedroom, that the unlocked bedroom was open to members of the family, including young grandchildren, that Brugger and Kuhns were accustomed to enter the bedroom, that Kuhns was injured in the bedroom by a shot from a firearm and the pistol was on the top of the dresser immediately after the shooting, that Mrs. Bach related a conversation with Kuhns after the shooting in which he expressed no hard feelings toward Brugger in connection with his injury \u2014 this evidence, with other testimony, was sufficient to establish prima facie negligence upon Bach\u2019s part.\nThe possession of this loaded Colt pistol did not constitute Bach an insurer against liability for injuries arising from its use nor render him liable without fault; it did, however, impose upon him a very serious and grave responsibility. Its possession placed upon him the duty of exercising not simply ordinary, but extraordinary care so that no harm might be visited upon others. We are not called upon to determine whether the possession of other instrumentalities or objects, such as knives, medicines, poisonous substances, etc., would impose the same degree of care under similar circumstances ; we are simply to determine the degree of care imposed upon the possessor of a loaded pistol, a weapon possessing lethal qualities, under the circumstances. In this connection the language of Mr. Justice Gibson in Sullivan v. Creed, 2 (Ir.) K.B.D. 317, 2 BRC 139, is appropriate: \u201cA hatchet, a bottle of poison labeled \u2018poison\u2019, the same bottle unlabeled, a loaded gun, gunpowder, or dynamite, all represent articles of varying degrees of danger, and the greater the danger the higher is the standard of the diligence which the law exacts.\u201d\nThe duty imposed upon Bach encompassed all those persons who might suffer harm or injury from the pistol\u2019s discharge and included the pistol\u2019s use not only by Bach but its use by a third person if Bach knew or had reason to know that such person was likely to use the pistol in such a manner as to create \u201can unreasonable risk of harm to others.\u201d\nOver many years Bach\u2019s grandchildren were visitors and guests at the cottage. Not only were the general living quarters of the cottage unrestricted to them but so also was his bedroom; in this respect the presence of little Katrina Brugger in the bedroom immediately before the shooting incident is highly significant. The grandchildren had the \u201crun of the house\u201d and Bach\u2019s bedroom was not \u201cout of bounds\u201d.\nIn that bedroom were kept not only fishing equipment but, at least, two firearms \u2014 all attractive to interested boys. Not only was Brugger aware of the fact that his grandfather possessed this pistol but he knew that it was kept in the bedroom; of these facts the grandfather was cognizant. Despite knowledge that the grandchildren frequented the unlocked bedroom Bach not only kept the pistol in an unlocked drawer but also in a loaded condition, i.e. the clip of cartridges was in the pistol handle.\nIt is contrary to every human experience to expect that children, particularly boys, would not want to touch and handle a pistol. There is something magnetic about highly engined firearms with their harmonious lines and graceful proportions which attracts both young and old, whether the ordnance be a beautiful revolver, an old-fashioned fowling piece or a piece of artillery. Bach knew or should have known that any 12 year old boy, such as either of his two grandsons, might rummage around his bedroom and, finding the pistol, handle it. Applying either the \u201cforesight\u201d or the \u201chindsight\u201d test, it is evident that Bach could have anticipated and foreseen the likelihood of harm resulting from leaving the loaded pistol in an unlocked drawer in a bedroom frequented by children.\nWhen Brugger came upon this pistol his first impulse \u2014 common to all boys \u2014 was to see if he could operate it. He, of course, entertained no desire to bring harm to his playmate cousin, but was simply overwhelmed by an impulse the existence of which is known to adults and against which Bach should have taken precautions.\nUnder the circumstances Bach was under a duty to keep this pistol away from his young grandchildren. Counsel for the Bach Estate argue that the decedent had a perfect right to keep this pistol in his home if only to protect himself against nocturnal prowlers. It is argued: \u201cWhere else should George Bach, in the exercise of reasonable prudence, have kept a gun for protection against unexpected midnight intrusion except ,in the dresser drawer of his private bedroom, where it would be readily available in case of need?\u201d No one can question the right or the prudence of Bach being .armed against possible midnight prowlers and intruders. However, this shooting did not take place at nighttime, but in the afternoon in a room where the presence of young grandchildren might be anticipated. As common prudence, in behalf of self-protection, justified the possession of the pistol for immediate use at night, equal prudence, in behalf of protecting children, dictated that the pistol be kept under lock and key in the daytime, especially in the grandfather\u2019s absence.\nWe are not confronted with the question of a grandparent\u2019s liability for the tortious conduct of a minor grandchild; on the contrary, we are determining whether the grandparent by his own conduct was guilty of negligence, and whether, if .negligent, his negligence was the proximate cause of Kuhns\u2019 injury. Bach\u2019s liability depends on the nature of the instrumentality involved, the place, the time and the persons , likely to be brought in contact with the instrumentality. The gist of the liability sought to be imposed is that Bach was negligent in permitting a highly dangerous instrumentality to be in a place where the incautious bands of a child might come in contact with it and the handling and discharge of this instrumentality by the child was the natural and probable consequence of Bach\u2019s negligence and such a consequence as might and ought to have been foreseen by Bach as likely to flow from his act. Bach\u2019s act in permitting this weapon, with its deadly potentialities, to remain in a place frequented by young children constituted negligence on his part; the intervention of his young grandchild did not break the chain of causation between his negligence and the injury which occurred and was a natural and probable result to be anticipated from the original negligence.\nThe Restatement of the Law of Torts, supra, \u00a7308, declares: \u201cIt is negligent to permit a third person to use a thing or to engage in an activity which is under the control of the actor, if the actor knows or should know that such person intends or is likely to use the thing or to conduct himself in the activity in such a manner as to create an unreasonable risk of harm to others.\u201d Particularly significant is Comment b thereunder: \u201cThe rule stated in this Section has its most frequent application where the third person is a member of a class which is notoriously likely to misuse the thing which the actor permits him to use. Thus, it is negligent to place loaded firearms or poisons within reach of young children or feeble-minded adults.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). Appellant (Bach Estate) seeks to distinguish the Restatement rule on the ground that Bach did not \u201cpermit\u201d the boy Brugger to use the pistol in that he did not expressly allow him to do so; such a distinction is unrealistic and would render meaningless Comment b. The further argument that, because of the juxtaposition of the words \u201cyoung children\u201d and \u201cfeeble-minded adults\u201d, Comment b is restricted to young children legally incapable of negligence does violence to the language of the Comment. Both the Restatement rule and the comment are apposite to the present situation.\nThe affixation of liability under circumstances similar to the instant situation is neither novel nor without precedent in other jurisdictions.\nA most interesting case is Sullivan v. Creed, supra. The facts were as follows: Sullivan and Creed, the latter a 16 year old boy, were returning from mass along a public road; Creed left Sullivan at a gap leading to Creed\u2019s home; Creed\u2019s father that morning had been shooting rabbits and had left his loaded gun along the path leading from the public road to his home while he went to his home to read the papers; young Creed, enroute home, found the gun, called to Sullivan and, while pointing the gun in the direction of Sullivan, the gun went off and injured Sullivan. The language of Palles, C. B., is particularly apposite: \u201cLastly, I cannot think that it was beyond the province of a jury to hold that he [the father] might have foreseen that the taking of the gun by the boy would not have been an improbable result of his seeing it, in a place where there was not a parent or a person in authority to prevent him. I am, therefore, of opinion that a jury might well have found that the defendant ought, under the circumstances, to have foreseen that the boy might take possession of the gun. But even this is not necessary, for, in my opinion, the liability of the defendant would be the same if he ought to have foreseen that any boy, as distinguished from this particular boy, might have seen and handled the gun; and having regard to the place in which it was placed, I think it would have been wholly impossible to have withdrawn from the jury the question whether he ought to have so foreseen. This alone, however, would not be enough. Ought he then to have foreseen that the boy might \u2014 -I do not say would, but that he might \u2014 -use the gun negligently? This appears to me to be the ultimate and crucial question in the case. . . . However, no one individual can determine what would be done by this hypothetical creature [a reasonable man] under any given state of circumstances otherwise than by his own experience, and, as the experience of one man usually differs from that of another, our law wisely says that what is \u2018reasonable\u2019 is to be determined by the jury \u2014 that is, it is to be the resultant of the, to a certain extent, varying opinions of twelve different persons . . . .\u201d\nThe precise question herein presented is one of first impression in this Court, although somewhat similar situations have been presented in the Superior Court. In Swanson v. Crandall et al., 2 Pa. Superior Ct. 85, the defendant father kept a loaded revolver in the upper drawer of a chiffonier located in a bedroom occupied by his wife and small child; the defendant\u2019s 5 year old daughter discovered and discharged the revolver wounding a nursemaid. The Superior Court held that the facts did not constitute a basis for recovery by the nursemaid. The Swanson decision might be distinguished upon the ground that there was no evidence that the child obtained the revolver from the drawer\u2014 the place where the defendant kept it \u2014 on the day of the accident; however, the language of this decision indicates that the father\u2019s act in keeping a loaded revolver in a place where its discovery and discharge by the child could be reasonably anticipated was not negligent and to that extent the decision in the Stoanson ease must be rejected. In Archibald v. Jewell, 70 Pa. Superior Ct. 247, a father allowed his son to use a device loaded with BB shot and the boy discharged the device and wounded another child; the Court considered the question of the father\u2019s negligence in knowingly permitting his son to possess and use such a device to be a question of fact for a jury to determine.\nMendola et al. v. Sambol, 166 Pa. Superior Ct. 351, 71 A. 2d 827, is very apposite. In that case the defendant-father kept a .22 calibre repeating rifle in his home; on the evening in question the father and a 11 year old son were going hunting for rats; while the father performed some chores he placed the gun unattended behind the living room door; the son found the gun, took it to the car in readiness for the hunting trip and then proceeded to demonstrate the operation of the gun to a 7 year old child and the gun was discharged injuring the child. In upholding a verdict for plaintiffs, the Superior Court found that the defendant was negligent and such negligence was the natural and probable cause of the accident \u201csince it was the natural and probable consequence of his negligent act in making the loaded gun accessible to his son.\u201d It is particularly significant that the Court recognized that there \u201care few things as attractive to a young boy as a gun\u201d and that, both before and since the Restatement of the Law of Torts, it was the accepted rule that a father\u2019s conduct in permitting his child to have access to a dangerous instrumentality and the child\u2019s me of it to the injury of another may be negligence depending on the circumstances. In Fleming et al. v. Kravitz, 260 Pa. 428, 103 A. 831, a 6 year old boy was playing with a toy air gun in the barrel of which was the stem of an ordinary match; the boy discharged the gun with the result that the match struck the eye' of another boy causing an injury. This Court, upholding a nonsuit, said that the alleged negligence \u2014 in permitting the hoy, immature and inexperienced, to be in possession of the gun, after warning from several persons who knew no more than he did that danger of an accident attended such indulgence on his part \u2014 did not involve the father in the accident.\nUnder the circumstances herein presented the question of Bach\u2019s liability was clearly for the jury to determine. The jury having found that he was negligent, and the evidence being sufficient to sustain such finding, judgment n.o.v. was properly refused.\nThe Bach Estate argued that the trial judge erred in refusing to sever the two actions for trial, especially in view of the Act of 1887, supra., which rendered inadmissible the testimony of Kuhns and Brugger as against the Bach Estate. When Kuhns\u2019 and Brugger\u2019s testimony were offered the Court very clearly instructed the jury that they were not to consider such testimony in determining the liability of the Bach Estate. In the trial judge\u2019s charge this question was again discussed and the jury was warned that Kuhns\u2019 and Brugger\u2019s testimony were not to be considered; the trial judge then said: \u201cIt will be necessary for you to determine the liability as to him [Bach], from testimony given otherwise than by Albert G. Kuhns and George A. Brugger as to events during the lifetime of George W. Bach.\u201d The instruction in this respect could not have been more clear. The liability of the Bach Estate was not dependent on the testimony of Kuhns and Brugger: as the Court below said in its Opinion: \u201cEliminating the testimony of Kuhns and Brugger under the direction of the court, the jury had more than sufficient facts and inferences from which to determine Bach\u2019s responsibility and liability. In addition to the facts previously herein recited Dr.- Ray H. Luke testified that about fifteen minutes after the accident he made an examination of the plaintiff, who he found at the foot of the dresser with a bullet in his chest and blood on the floor near him. The defendant Bach\u2019s gun was at the time on top of the dresser with bullets in it. After the accident Bach admitted to the policeman that he always kept this pistol in the dresser in a holster with loaded bullets in a clip inserted in the handle of the pistol but without a bullet in the chamber.\u201d\nThe Bach Estate, moreover, did not present this question in the statement of questions involved. In line with our well established rule this argument which related to a question not presented in the statement of questions involved should not be considered on this appeal : Rule 35, Rules of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania : Kerr v. O\u2019Donovan, 389 Pa. 614, 630, 134 A. 2d 213; Blue Anchor Overall Co. v. Pa. L. Mut. Ins., 385 Pa. 394, 402, 123 A. 2d 413; Burke Appeal, 378 Pa. 616, 108 A. 2d 58.\nIn behalf of their motions for a new trial, both defendants allege trial errors, all of which we have considered. We see no merit in the contention that the Bach Estate was prejudiced in the eyes of the jury because, in his opening statement to the jury, counsel for the plaintiff said that Bach was the president of the American Sterilizer Company. The judge instructed the jury that Bach\u2019s position had nothing to do with the issue. Nor was the Bach Estate prejudiced to its harm becaxise the jury panel was asked whether any of them were stockholders or employees of the American Sterilizer Company.\nThe appellants find fault with various remarks made by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in his summation to the jury. We see nothing in those utterances which go beyond what is generally heard in zealous partisan argumeiits to juries.\nThe difference between allegata and probata alleged by the appellants finds no basis in fact.\nIt is contended further that the Court\u2019s charge was inadequate and misleading both as to negligence and contributory negligence features. Counsel in their briefs quote various portions of the Court\u2019s charge and consider them as isolated from the remaining parts of the charge. Without conceding that any particular statement made by the judge was improper or incorrect, we are convinced that taking the Court\u2019s charge as a whole it properly propounded the law applicable to the particular circumstances under discussion.\nThe appellants submit also that the trial judge erred in sending out a memorandum with the jury on possible verdicts. The evidence introduced on expenses incurred and to be incurred was voluminous and intricate. The memorandum was given for the purpose of guiding the jury, and was in no sense a direction as to what they should do. We find no fault with the lower Court\u2019s explanation, as given in his opinion: \u201cThe first item on the memorandum suggested the verdict for the defendants in case there was no right of recovery because neither defendant was guilty of negligence or the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. The breakdown of the various possible verdicts if a recovery was to be allowed was in the court\u2019s opinion necessary, and it was proper. An examination of that memorandum will indicate the difficulty the jury would have had in correctly considering and allocating the many items involved under the testimony.\u201d\nFinally, it is argued that the verdict was excessive. The jury returned a verdict in the sum of $36,764 for the parents and $145,332 for the minor plaintiff. The Court below reduced these amounts to $30,104.60 and $86,500, respectively, a total reduction of $65,491.40. The evidence justified the final judgment as entered by the Court after the plaintiffs had filed appropriate remittiturs. Without entering into details as to Albert Kuhns\u2019 injury, disability, and incapacity, it is enough to say that, as a paraplegic victim of a gunshot wound, with his spinal cord severed, his lower organs uncontrollable, and his pedal locomotion destroyed, he has practically nothing to look forward to in life economically, and very little to expect in the way of physical comfort and happiness. An indication of his total helplessness, and the reasonableness of the verdict, as reduced, can be gained from the following portion of the lower Court\u2019s Opinion: \u201cIt is further contended that the court erred in permitting the jury to consider as an item of damages $2400.00, the cost of an \u2018ell\u2019 added to the plaintiff\u2019s home for his convenience and to permit him by the installation thereof to do many things for himself which would otherwise require more constant attention at additional expense. The testimony was that this installation was made at cost and without profit to the contractor. Dr. Keck stated that with this room and the equipment in it the plaintiff could without help get in and out of his bath and with the installed crane and pulley also move into the bed and to a commode. Pictures in evidence show the real necessity and usefulness of the installation. Bathing was necessary to remove muscle spasms which frequently and unexpectedly occurred. The doctor stated that this facility furnished better medical care and rehabilitation and saved expense. The court charged, \u2018If you consider this item reasonable, you may allow it as you would a brace. If you consider it was not reasonable under all the circumstances, then you may like any other item, eliminate it.\u2019 We find no error on this point.\u201d\nStrangely enough, the Bach Estate, while arguing that the verdict was excessive, complains as to the manner in which the lower Court reduced the verdict: \u201cBy way of illustration of the arbitrary manner in which the reductions were made by the lower Court, attention is called to the Court\u2019s conclusion that the award for minor plaintiff\u2019s food and education expenses and care should be reduced from the aggregate of $75,175.40 awarded by the jury to $47,540.00.\u201d\nWe find no error which would justify a retrial of this case, and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.\nMr. Justice Cohen dissents.\nGeorge W. Bach, the grandfather, died subsequent to the shooting incident but prior to the time suit was instituted.\nSee footnote in Sherman v. Manufacturers Light and Heat Company, 389 Pa. 61, 68, 132 A. 2d 255, Wherein Mr. Justice Bell said: \u201cIt is sometimes erroneously contended that in considering the grant or refusal of a new trial, just as in a consideration of an appeal from the refusal to take off a nonsuit or from the entry of a judgment non obstante veredicto, all of the evidence must be taken in the light most favorable to the verdict winner. Of course this is not the correct test on an appeal from the grant or refusal of a new trial: [Citing cases]\u201d\nThe words \u201cpistol\u201d and \u201crevolver\u201d are used, in common parlance, indiscriminately; strictly, however, a \u201crevolver\u201d must have a revolving cylinder and chambers for cartridges: Bright v. State, 125 Neb. 817, 252 NW 386.\nThis testimony was inadmissible against the Bach Estate because of the prohibition of the so-called \u201cDead Man\u2019s Rule\u201d (Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, \u00a75(e), 28 PS \u00a7322).\nOur legislature lias recognized tliat a young child and a firearm constitute a dangerous combination. The Penal Code (Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, \u00a7626, 18 PS \u00a74626) declares that any person who knowingly and wilfully sells or causes to be sold a deadly weapon to a person under 18 years of age is guilty of a misdemeanor. It is also unlawful for a person between 12 and 14 years of age to use firearms for hunting unless accompanied by a parent, guardian or adult member of his family: Act of June 3, 1937, P. L. 1225, Art. III, \u00a7316, as amended, 34 PS \u00a71311.316(d).\nThe Uniform Firearms Act (Act of 1939, supra, \u00a762S, as amended, 18 PS \u00a74628) prohibits the delivery of a firearm \u2014 a pistol or revolver with less than a 12\" barrel, a shotgun with less than a 24\" barrel or a rifle with less than a 15\" barrel \u2014 to any person under the age of 16 years.

Brugger on direct examination stated: \u201cWhen I took it [the pistol] out of the drawer, I was facing that way [Albert\u2019s direction]. And when I pulled the slide back, I mean that was the way I was facing, and that was the way it was pointed.\u201d On cross-examination he stated: \u201cQ. The gun was pointed toward Albert? A. Yes sir. Q. Who pointed it? A. I did.\u201d\nThe Restatement of the Law of Torts, \u00a7283, provides: \u201cUnless the actor is a child, the standard of conduct to which he must conform to avoid being negligent is that of a reasonable man under like circumstances.\u201d Comment (e) thereunder states: \u201cA child of tender years is not required to conform to the standard of behavior which it is reasonable to expect of an adult, but his conduct is to be judged by the standard of behavior to be expected from a child of like age, intelligence and experience. The standard of conduct required of such a child is that which it is reasonable to expect of children of like age, intelligence and experience. In so far as concerns the child\u2019s capacity to realize the existence of a risk, the individual qualities of the child are taken into account.\u201d\nBy analogy to the criminal law: Com. v.

Savo et uv., 350 Pa. 350, 352, 39 A. 2d 51, it was stated: \u201cAt common law the mere relation of parent and child imposes upon the parent no liability for the torts of the child, but the parents may be liable where the act of the child is done as the agent \u00f3f the parents or where the negligence of the parents makes the injury possible. The injury committed by the child must have been the natural and probable consequence of the parents\u2019 negligent act, that is, a consequence which, under the surrounding circumstances, might and ought reasonably to have been foreseen as likely to flow from such negligent act. ... \u2018In determining what is the proximate cause, the true rule is, that the injury must be the natural and probable consequence of the negligence \u2014 such a consequence as, under the surrounding circumstances of the case, might and ought to have been foreseen by the wrongdoer as likely to flow from his act\u2019: Hoag & Alger, v.

Crudale, 41 R.

R. 20 (where a father kept a loaded revolver in an unlocked bureau drawer from which his 12 year old son obtained it and shot another person, the court charged the jury that if they found that the father, under the circumstances, was negligent in placing a loaded revolver in an unlocked bureau drawer, within the reach of children too immature to appreciate its danger, and such negligence resulted in injury to the plaintiff, the father could be held liable for the consequences) ; Smith v. Salvaggio, 4 Tenn.

In Warren \u201cNegligence in the New York Courts\u2019\u2019, Vol. 2, \u00a786, p. 439, it is stated: \u201cIn some eases the negligence of the parent consists in permitting a child to use a dangerous instrumentality such as an air rifle or gun. In these eases the negligence of the parent does not arise out of the discharge of the gun by the child but the permitting the child to have it so that through its wrongful discharge injury may result to others. In order for the parent to be held liable even under these circumstances, however, his act must be established by proof as previously indicated. Where the act charged is the wrongful use of a gun, it must be established either by direct evidence or reasonable inference that the gun was used by the child with the parent\u2019s knowledge.\u201d\nIn that case a judgment for defendant was appealed to the King\u2019s Bench Division (Ireland) on plaintiff\u2019s motion to set aside the directed verdict; the King\u2019s Bench Division by a 2-1 vote set aside the judgment and entered judgment for plaintiff; the Court of Appeal (Ireland) sustained the view of the majority of the King\u2019s Bench Division.\nThe use of memoranda is not without precedent: Pa.
