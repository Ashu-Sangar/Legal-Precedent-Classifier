{"id": "1048477", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe first and second assignments complain of the admission of testimony. It was offered and properly received to show malice, hatred and ill will on the part of the prisoner toward the victim of Ms wrath. The remaining assignments, complaining of portions of the charge and answers to points, are utterly without merit, and it remains only to say that the judgment is affirmed, with direction that the record be remitted for the purpose of execution."}
