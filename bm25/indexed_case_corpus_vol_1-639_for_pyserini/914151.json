{"id": "914151", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe think the opinion of the learned court below sufficiently vindicates the conclusion reached that the issue asked for in this case ought to be refused. The case of McGovran\u2019s Est., 185 Pa. 203, cited by the learned judge, clearly rules the present application. This case was followed in refusing the application and we therefore affirm the decree for the reasons stated in the opinion of the court below."}
