{"id": "1906707", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Cohen,\nThis is an appeal by Scott Paper Company (Scott) in connection with its Pennsylvania corporate net income tax for the calendar year 1955. During that year Scott, a major producer of paper products, cut various quantities of timber owned by it and located in states outside of Pennsylvania. This cut timber had a fair market value on January 1, 1955, of $5,128,136; and all of it had been held by Scott for more than six months prior to January 1, 1955. Of this cut timber Scott used in its own business a quantity valued at $3,272,923. The remaining timber, valued at $1,855,213, was sold by Scott to other persons for a total price of $3,390,022.\nUnder specific provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code, Scott realized a capital gain of $4,414,-021 on the cutting of this timber. Section 631(a) of the Code gives to a taxpayer an election to consider timber cut by it during the year either for sale to others or for use in its own business as a \u201csale or exchange\u201d of such timber. Section 1231(a) of the Code states that if gains on sales or exchanges of property used in a taxpayer\u2019s trade or business exceed the losses from such sales or exchanges during the year, these gains and losses shall be considered long-term in nature. Finally, \u00a71231 (b)(2) rounds out this trail of 'artificial tax concepts by stating that the phrase \u201cproperty used in the [taxpayer\u2019s] trade or business\u201d in \u00a71231 (a) shall include timber covered by \u00a7631. By this labyrinthine route a cutting of timber for use in one\u2019s own business may be transformed into a long-term capital gain subject to the attendant tax benefits .applicable to such form of income for federal tax purposes. Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \u00a71201.\nIn its 1955 federal income tax report Scott made tbe election allowed by \u00a7631 (a) and showed the above gain as \u201cnet long-term capital gain\u201d and so included it in federal taxable income. In its Pennsylvania corporate net income tax report it allocated all of this gain outside of Pennsylvania in accordance with the provision of \u00a72 of the Corporate Net Income Tax Act which states that gains realized from the sale or exchange of tangible capital assets situated outside of Pennsylvania shall be allocated entirely outside of Pennsylvania.\nIn settling Scott\u2019s tax, however, the state refused to allocate this amount in accordance with the above provision. Instead, it treated the $4,414,021 as ordinary income subject to the regular three-fraction allocation formula, thereby diverting part of this income (and the tax thereon) to Pennsylvania.\nScott appealed, and the court below divided the income into two categories. As to the gain arising from the cutting by Scott of timber for use in its own business, the court disallowed the specific allocation outside of Pennsylvania, presumably on the ground that there was no sale or exchange. As to the remaining gain\u2014that arising from the cutting of timber later sold to others\u2014the court held there was a sale or exchange of a tangible capital asset and allowed the outside allocation. In reaching each of these conclusions, however, the lower court rejected Scott\u2019s argument that the characterization of the transaction for federal tax purposes controlled the state treatment. Instead, it held that the matter was one solely governed by state law, being a problem of allocation rather than one of computation of taxable income. Only tbe latter, it said, was controlled by federal concepts.\nScott appealed to this Court from tbe adverse ruling on tbe timber used by it in its business. No appeal has been taken by the Commonwealth with respect to the lower court\u2019s allowance of an outside allocation for gain on the sold timber.\nScott relies heavily in this appeal on our recent decision in Commonwealth v. General Refractories Co., 417 Pa. 153, 207 A. 2d 833 (1965), a case in which we dealt with the deduction granted corporations under the Corporate Net Income Tax Act for dividends received from other corporations. The problem there stemmed from Pennsylvania\u2019s allowance of a 100% deduction while the Federal Code only provided for an 85% deduction in computing taxable income. Because of this a special state deduction had to be taken after federal taxable income was computed. We rejected the State\u2019s argument that simply because the deduction was made \u201cafter\u201d taxable income was determined, the state was free to apply its own ideas regarding what was or was not a dividend. In dismissing this \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201cafter\u201d test, we stated the correct rule: \u201c. . . it is whether or not the Corporate Net Income Tax Act requires that the deduction be taken by reference to federal standards or state concepts (if, in fact, there is a difference between them).\u201d 417 Pa. 153, 162, 207 A. 2d 833, 837.\nWe reaffirm this principle. The question in each case cannot be answered by some automatic reference to a \u201cbefore taxable income or after taxable income\u201d test. Rather, the meaning of the Corporate Net Income Tax Act (which may, as in the General Refractories case, or may not require reference to federal concepts) must be determined in the context of the problem involved.\nSimilarly, we find no merit in the Commonwealth\u2019s and lower court\u2019s attempted distinction between the General Refractories case and this one. That distinction was based upon the presence in the Corporate Net Income Tax Act of a specific reference allowing a deduction for dividends to the extent they are included in \u201ctaxable income as returned to and ascertained by the Federal Government\u201d and the absence of any similar reference regarding capital gains. But the quoted language was only added to the C.N.I. Act in 1955 in order to accommodate the 100% dividend deduction policy of that Act to a 1954 change in the Federal Code. It represented no change in the meaning of the Act from the time of its inception as, in our General Refractories opinion, we noted. Therefore, the specific reference to Federal taxable income with respect to dividends was not vital to that decision and is of no importance in determining the present issue.\nSimply reiterating our adherence to the basic principle of the General Refractories case (as Scott urges) and rejecting the State\u2019s distinction between that case and this (again, as Scott urges) is hardly dispositive of the case in Scott\u2019s favor, however. Here, too, as in General Refractories, we must look at the interpretative aids: The language of the C.N.I. Act, the history of the allocation provision and, if any, the administrative practices of the State.\nScott argues that the language of the C.N.I. Act is so similar to the language of the Federal Code that the legislature must have intended to base the State allocation on the Federal concept. In fact, Scott says the use and history of the phrase \u201cgain from the sale or exchange of capital assets\u201d is so peculiarly federal that no other interpretation is possible. We are considerably less certain of this than is Scott, however.\nNeither the federal statutory income tax provisions of 1913, 38 Stat. 166, nor the Revenue Act of 1916, 39 Stat. 756, contained any language whatsoever dealing specially with the sale of capital assets. The Revenue Act of 1918, \u00a7202(a), 40 Stat. 1060, did use the phrase \u201cgain derived or loss sustained from the sale or other disposition of property,\u201d but this use was only in a general section regarding the computation of the amount of gain includible in the income of individuals. There was still no special tax treatment for capital transactions.\nThe Revenue Act of 1921, \u00a7206 (b), 42 Stat. 233, for the first time provided special alternative tax treatment for capital gains but only for individuals. Section 206(a), 42 Stat. 232, defined capital gain as taxable gain from the \u201csale or exchange of capital assets.\u201d Here, then, for the first time, the familiar federal treatment, so common today, is found.\nThe first appearance of this phraseology in Pennsylvania tax law appears in the emergency profits tax Act of June 28, 1923, P. L. 876, 878. The provision in that Act allocated capital gains (for corporations transacting business outside of Pennsylvania) as follows:\n\u201cSection 3 . . . (a) Gains realized from the sale of capital assets, if such assets consist of intangible property, or if they consist of real estate, tangible or personal property, situated in the Commonwealth, shall be allocated to this Commonwealth, (b) Gains realized from the sale of capital assets, if such assets consist of real estate or tangible personal property situated outside of the Commonwealth, shall not be allocated in any part to this Commonwealth.\u201d\nWhat is most striking about this language is not any similarity to the recently enacted Federal Revenue Act of 1921, but its almost complete identification with a Massachusetts Act of 1919 imposing an income tax on corporations. General Acts of 1919, Ch. 355. Section 6 of this Act, for example, provides for allocation of capital gains by domestic corporations in the following language: \u201cGains realized from the sale of capital assets shall, if such assets consisted of intangible property, be determined to be income taxable under this act; but if such assets consisted of real estate or tangible personal property the gains realized from the sale thereof shall be apportioned to the states in which such property is situated.\u201d\nThis provision soon came to be rewritten in form until it provided for allocation as follows: \u201cGains realized from the sale of capital assets, if such assets consist of intangible property, or if they consist of real estate or tangible personal property situated in the commonwealth, shall be allocated to this commonwealth. Gains received from the sale of capital assets, if such assets consist of real estate or tangible personal property situated outside the commonwealth, shall not be allocated in any part to this commonwealth.\u201d\nCompare this to the wording of the Pennsylvania Corporate Net Income Tax Act as it was originally enacted in 1935:\n\u201cSection 2. ... 2. . . (a) Gains realized from the sale of capital assets, if such assets consist of real estate or tangible personal property situated in the Commonwealth, shall be allocated to this Commonwealth, (b) Gains realized from the sale of capital assets, if such assets consist of real estate or tangible personal property situated outside of the Commonwealth, shall not be allocated in any part to this Commonwealth.\u201d\nIn light of this background we are not disposed to agree with Scott that the Pennsylvania statute clearly was written with both eyes on the Federal tax laws. It is equally, if not more, reasonable to conclude that the language of our capital gains provision Avas derived by the legislature from a concept of capital gains allocation of which the Massachusetts statute is a leading example. History, therefore, is far from compelling in Scott\u2019s favor.\nSimilarly, we find no clear history of administrative practice here such as was stipulated by the parties in the General Refractories case. Scott refers to a recent ruling of the Department of Revenue known as Taxing Memorandum No. 56 which ties the amount of allocable capital gain to the amount recognized as capital gain by the Federal Government in the application of \u00a7\u00a71245 and 1250 of the Internal Revenue Code to transactions of the taxpayer and requires the federally denominated \u201cordinary gain\u201d to be allocated as ordinary income. This matter is not before us, of course; but we find it difficult to understand how, under the Corporate Net Income Tans Act, gain from an admitted sale or exchange of an admitted capital asset, can be so divided. If this be so, the administrative memorandum is wrong, and our conclusion here regarding the independence of the State\u2019s determination of what is or is not capital gain subject to allocation is reinforced.\nWe agree with Scott that such an approach creates more difficulties and uncertainties in the administration of Pennsylvania\u2019s Tax laws, but this is a matter for the legislature to correct if it so desires. We believe that the language of the C.N.I. Act and the history of this language do not evidence a legislative intent to deny to the Commonwealth the right to make its own determination of what constitutes the sale or exchange of a capital asset giving rise to gain allocable as stated by the Act. While this determination may parallel the federal one in most cases, it is not automatically governed thereby but must be based on Pennsylvania\u2019s own decision as to what is a capital asset and what is a sale or exchange.\nTherefore, we turn to a consideration of whether the transaction in question here involved the sale or exchange of a capital asset. We have no difficulty in concluding with Scott and the lower court that the timber in question was a capital asset in Scott\u2019s hands, but we cannot find the requisite \u201csale or exchange\u201d in a cutting for one\u2019s own use. Taken in their ordinary sense, these words are not laden with ambiguities. Both denote transfers in one way or another. Here, no transfer occurred. Therefore, we must reject Scott\u2019s claim and sustain the Commonwealth\u2019s refusal to allow a specific allocation for the gain in question.\nThe court below ordered the matter remanded to the Department of Revenue for resettlement. This was improper. State tax appeals are heard de novo by the lower court, \u00a71104 of The Fiscal Code, Act of April 9, 1929, P. L. 343, 72 P.S. \u00a71104; and it is incumbent upon that court to enter a final judgment determining the tax liability. If a resettlement must be made and the court has insufficient information with which to make one, its only proper recourse is to direct the parties to prepare and submit a computation upon which the court can base its judgment. Hence, the proceeding must be remanded to the lower court with a direction that it have such a computation prepared and submitted to it for the entry by it of a final judgment.\nThe judgment of the court below is modified as stated and, as so modified, affirmed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nThis gain was computed by deducting the \u201ccost\u201d (actually, the adjusted basis for depletion) of this timber from the above-noted fair market value. The amount of receipts arising from the timber sold to others are irrelevant to this computation.\nThe state cross-appealed, but the issues raised by it are not before us on tbis appeal.\nIt was not until passage of the Revenue Act of 1942, 56 Stat. 798, in fact, that corporations were given the alternative of treating capital gains in a fashion different from ordinary income. Id. \u00a7150, 56 Stat. 843.\nForeign corporations included such gains only if from real estate or tangible personal property situated within Massachusetts. General Acts of 1919, Ch. 355, \u00a719.\nSee General Laws of Massachuetts, Tercentenary Edition (1932), Oh. 63, \u00a737. This provision remained substantially the same until extensive changes in substance were made in 1966. See General Acts of 1966, Ch. 698, \u00a7\u00a757 and 58.\nIn fact, as if to illustrate Scott\u2019s argument regarding the difficulties inherent in these matters, we note that the capital gain produced from the timber sold by Scott to others was not a gain resulting from a sale or exchange either. It arose, also, from the cutting of the timber; and the subsequent sale by Scott only affected Scott\u2019s ordinary income. See Internal Revenue Code of 1954, \u00a7631 (a) and Regs. \u00a71.631-1 (e). However, since the Commonwealth did not appeal from that part of the lower court\u2019s decision allowing Scott to allocate this part of the gain, we need not review this point further."}
