{"id": "1755602", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nEdward A. Gallagher died on December 18, 1969. Appellee, Provident National Bank (Provident), presented for probate a document which was handwritten on a printed will form. The trial court in the matter before us described this document as one written \u201cin a confused and haphazard manner.\u201d The document contained writing after the signature and contained writing in a vertical direction in the margins. When the handwritten document was presented for probate, Provident also submitted a typed \u201ccopy\u201d of the document. Unlike the handwritten document, all the provisions in the typed copy appeared in an orderly fashion with the decedent\u2019s signature at the end thereof. This typed copy is referred to in the record as a \u201ccopy fair.\u201d Provident was granted letters of administration and proceeded to administer the estate. On May 9, 1975, the trial court\u2019s adjudication confirming Provident\u2019s first and final account was made absolute and distribution proceeded in accordance with the court\u2019s decree.\nApproximately eleven months later, on April 5, 1976, appellant, Daniel Gallagher, a brother and legal heir of the decedent, filed a \u201cPetition for Citation to Show Cause Why Audit Should not be Set Aside and Letters of Administration Revoked.\u201d Appellee, Provident, responded by filing \u201cPreliminary Objections,\u201d following which, the trial court without holding any hearing dismissed appellant\u2019s petition.\nAppellant contends in this appeal that the trial court erred in dismissing the petition without a hearing. We agree.\nAppellant does not dispute the fact that when he filed his petition on April 5, 1976, the normal appeal time had expired. He argues, however, that his petition collaterally attacking probate and the trial court\u2019s final adjudication and decree of distribution, was not subject to the ordinary appeal periods because the petition alleged fraud. The trial court considered the fraud argument but dismissed the petition nonetheless stating that \u201ca mere allegation is not sufficient\u201d and further stating \u201cthe charge of fraud is merely an unsupported declaration.\u201d\nWe agree with appellant that his petition alleging fraud was timely filed and we disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the petition contained \u201ca nebulous claim of fraud.\u201d\nAppellant\u2019s petition read as follows:\n\u201cThe petition of Daniel Gallagher, respectfully represents that:\n1. Your Petitioner resides at 70 Darby Road, Paoli, Chester County, Pennsylvania and is a brother of the decedent, Edward A. Gallagher.\n2. Edward A. Gallagher died December 18, 1969 in Letterkenny County Donegal, Republic of Ireland having first made and published his handwritten last will and testament dated September 28, 1965 which was witnessed by two persons. A copy of said document with subsequent alterations, is attached hereto as Exhibit \u2018A\u2019.\n3. Thereafter, on September 15, 1972, Letters of Administration, C.T.A. were granted to Provident National Bank which presented with the Petition therefore an alleged \u2018fair copy\u2019 of the handwritten will of decedent.\n4. The said \u2018fair copy\u2019 indicated the location of testator\u2019s signature at a place on the will different from that on the original handwritten will (see Exhibit \u2018A\u2019).\n5. The original will, at the time it was executed, was signed at the end thereof but, subsequent to its execution, was altered by the addition of writing after the signature.\n6. At the time said will was offered for probate, Provident National Bank knew, or should have known, that the \u2018fair copy\u2019 submitted did not accurately represent the handwritten will but, notwithstanding such knowledge, Provident fraudulently represented to the Register of Wills that the \u2018fair copy\u2019 of said will as prepared by Provident was a true copy of the will as executed when, in fact, the bequests set forth in the \u2018fair copy\u2019 were added to the will after it had been signed and witnessed.\n7. As a result of fraudulently obtaining Letters of Administration, Provident illegally obtained possession of the assets of the Estate of Edward A. Gallagher resulting in a disposition of those assets to those not legally entitled.\n8. On January 17, and May 6, 1974, Provident presented its First and Final Account for Audit and in continued reliance upon its \u2018fair copy\u2019, fraudulently represented to your Honorable Court that the decedent died testate with respect to all his property, that the will was properly executed and that the residuary estate was to be divided equally among Hanneman Hospital, Jefferson Hospital, Temple University Hospital, University Hospital and Presbyterian Hospital of New York. The account of this estate was approved by the Court on the basis of a will substantially different from that submitted for probate by Provident and upon which letters were granted to Provident.\n9. In the alternative, the probate of the will as aforesaid has resulted in a mistake on the part of the Court in the distribution of the residuary of the Estate of Edward A. Gallagher.\nWHEREFORE, Petitioner asks that a Citation issue upon Provident National Bank to show cause why the audit should not be set aside, the Letters of Administration granted to Respondent revoked and the compensation paid to the Administrator returned.\u201d\nIt is true that a petition alleging fraud without specificity is insufficient. On the other hand, neither a petition nor any other pleading alleging fraud is required to contain in detail all of the evidence in advance of its development during a hearing. The above petition contains more than a mere allegation of fraud. The petition and the reasonable inferences contained therein allege that the appellee when it presented the handwritten document to the register also presented \u201cfair copy\u201d (typed copy) which was different from the original. The petition alleges that the original was not signed at the end thereof but the submitted \u201cfair copy\u201d indicated a signature at the end thereof. The petition further alleges that fraudulent representations were made to the trial court which resulted in the court\u2019s approval of the account on the basis of the \u201cfair copy\u201d which was different from the original.\nThese allegations are specific and are sufficient to allow the petition to successfully withstand the claim that it is \u201cnebulous\u201d or only contains \u201ca mere allegation of fraud\u201d or that the charge of fraud in the petition is \u201cmerely an unsupported declaration.\u201d\nIt may be that at a hearing appellant will be unable to convince the fact finder that fraud existed in the probate of the will or in the administration of the estate. This is not the issue now before us. Appellant is entitled to his day in court on the issue of fraud. From the record before us, there is no evidence concerning the practice of using a \u201ccopy fair.\u201d (The parties interchangeably use \u201ccopy fair\u201d and \u201cfair copy.\u201d) Although this Court was given some information during oral argument about the local practice, this cannot be a substitute for testimony taken under oath during a hearing. Moreover, the record is silent concerning the specific use made of the \u201ccopy fair.\u201d We do not know whether the probate records would reasonably alert a searcher. We do not know whether the trial court had before it the original will or only the typed copy. We do not know whether persons entitled to legal notice during the administration of the estate had any way of knowing that the original existed or that it was different from the typed copy. These matters are only illustrative of what we do not know from the record before us. Appellant is entitled to an opportunity to prove whether or not there was fraud.\nSince appellant\u2019s petition contains a sufficient allegation of fraud, its consideration is not barred by the ordinary time limits for appeals.
