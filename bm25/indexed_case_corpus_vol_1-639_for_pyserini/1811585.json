{"id": "1811585", "contents": "OPINION\nMcDERMOTT, Justice.\nCatherine Love appeals from an order of the Commonwealth Court reversing an order of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas which entered judgment for appellant against the City of Philadelphia, 98 Pa.Cmwlth. 138, 509 A.2d 1388. The facts as found by the trial court are as follows.\nIn approximately August of 1979, Catherine Love, then age 73, began attending the Mann Adult Center which was administered by the City of Philadelphia, Department of Public Health. Mrs. Love was transported to and from the Mann Center in a city owned van driven by Mr. Robert Kitchen. Mrs. Love was blind in one eye and had impaired vision in the other, and therefore required assistance boarding and alighting from the van. Mr. Kitchen usually parked the van at the curb in front of Mrs. Love\u2019s home. He would place a portable step at the doors to the van and would assist Mrs. Love in and out of the van.\nOn the afternoon of February 15, 1980, Mr. Kitchen transported Mrs. Love, the last occupant of the van that day, from the Mann Center to her home. Mrs. Love fell while alighting from the van, landing in the street with her feet approximately three feet from the curb line and her back approximately two feet from the portable step which had been placed next to the van.\nMr. Kitchen became aware that Mrs. Love had fallen and summoned the help of Mrs. Love\u2019s daughter-in-law and granddaughter. The Philadelphia Police were called and Mrs. Love was transported to Episcopal Hospital for treatment of her injuries. Mrs. Love suffered multiple injuries and was subsequently placed in a nursing home.\nCatherine Love filed an action against the City of Philadelphia alleging that the city\u2019s negligence caused her injuries. The case was heard non-jury. At the conclusion of the trial the judge entered a verdict for Catherine Love against the city in the amount of $375,000.00. The court held that Mrs. Love\u2019s injuries were caused by the negligence of an employee of the City of Philadelphia who was acting within the scope of his employment, and that Mrs. Love\u2019s cause of action came within the \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d exception to the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act.\nThe city appealed to the Commonwealth Court which reversed the trial court\u2019s verdict, holding that the facts of this case did not fall under the \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d exception. Hence, the city was held to be immune from suit.\nCatherine Love petitioned this court for allowance of appeal, and we granted allocatur. Her appeal presents one issue: whether the act of entering into or alighting from a motor vehicle constitutes operation of that vehicle under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(1).\nLocal agencies are immune from tort liability except for certain specific exceptions enumerated in the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act. One of those exceptions applies to vehicle liability, and it provides in relevant part that liability may result from \u201c[t]he operation of any motor vehicle in the possession or control of the local agency\"\nThe statute does not define the word \u201coperation\u201d, nor is it defined in the general definition section of the consolidated statutes. It is therefore our responsibility to derive the intent of the General Assembly in using the word. See Statutory Construction Act of 1972. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a).\nIn the recent case of Mascaro v. Youth Study Center, 514 Pa. 351, 523 A.2d 1118 (1987), this Court held that exceptions to governmental immunity were to be \u201cnarrowly interpreted ... given the expressed legislative intent to insulate political subdivisions from tort liability.\u201d Id., 514 Pa. at 361, 523 A.2d at 1123 (1987). See Casey v. Geiger, 346 Pa.Super. 279, 499 A.2d 606 (1985); Vann v. Board of Education of the School District of Philadelphia, 76 Pa.Cmwlth. 604, 464 A.2d 684 (1983). Therefore, we are constrained to strictly construe the crucial term, i.e. \u201coperation\u201d.\nWhere terms are not otherwise defined \u201cwords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903. We have generally used dictionaries as source material for determining the common and approved usage of a term. See e.g. Matthews v. Konieczny, 515 Pa. 106, 527 A.2d 508 (1987), in which we interpreted the meaning of \u201ccustomer\u201d as it pertained to an immunity provision of the Liquor Code.\nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary defines the word \u201coperate\u201d as follows:\nThis word, when used with relation to automobiles, signifies a personal act in working the mechanism of the automobile ... (citations omitted)\nBlack\u2019s further defines \u201coperation\u201d as: the process of operating or mode of action.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, p. 984 (rev. 5th ed. 1979).\nSimilar definitions are found in the Oxford Dictionary. See Oxford English Dictionary, Volume VII, p. 144 (1933). The American Heritage Dictionary defines \u201coperation\u201d as \u201c[t]o run or control the functioning of: operate a machine\u201d; and defines \u201coperation\u201d as \u201c[t]he state of being operative or functioning in operation.\u201d See The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, p. 920 (7th ed. 1971).\nThe trial court eschewed these dictionary definitions, choosing instead to look to the Pennsylvania No-Fault Act. By this analytical method the court found that \u201coperation\u201d included entering into or alighting from the vehicle. However, the definition relied upon by the trial court, found at 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.103 referred to the \u201cmaintenance and use of a motor vehicle.\u201d It did not define \u201coperation\u201d of a vehicle and thus was inapplicable to this case. Furthermore, as the Commonwealth Court noted, the No-Fault Act was intended to be broadly construed to provide coverage wherever possible. As we have noted, that was not the legislative intention behind the motor vehicle exception to governmental immunity.\nReference to the No-Fault Act is instructive, however, on one point, in that it demonstrates that the General Assembly recognized a distinction between the term \u201coperation\u201d and the phrase \u201cmaintenance and use,\u201d since it carefully chose to use one term in one context but not in the other. The General Assembly does not lightly choose its words, and the choice of distinct descriptions cannot be ignored. See Daly v. Hemphill, 411 Pa. 263, 273, 191 A.2d 835, 842 (1963). Thus the term \u201coperates\u201d must have been intended to mean something other than \u201cmaintenance and use.\u201d\nAs we have illustrated, to operate something means to actually put it in motion. Merely preparing to operate a vehicle, or acts taken at the cessation of operating a vehicle are not the same as actually operating that vehicle. Thus, according to the common and approved usage of the word \u201coperation\u201d, the van was not in operation at the time of Mrs. Love\u2019s accident. Getting into or alighting from a vehicle are merely acts ancillary to the actual operation of that vehicle.\nIn summary, we wish to emphasize that the issue here is not whether one may be tortiously injured entering or alighting from a stopped vehicle. Rather, the issue is the confining question of whether a political subdivision is immunized from suit when one is so injured, notwithstanding what may be the actual tort of their employees. The legislature, for reasons of policy, reasons we are not entitled to dilute for sympathy or even outrage at specific instances of blatant tort, has decided that such an immunity does exist, and we must abide, sometimes leaving dreadful injuries, negligently inflicted, uncompensated. See Mascaro, supra.\nThe juridicial concept that where there is a wrong there must be a right often depends on the wisdom and large responsibility of the legislature. What rights for what wrongs are generally their prerogative and apportioned in the exercise of their many responsibilities and competing needs. Their task, like ours, is never easy. However, it is our duty to respect and enforce their judgment, even with heavy hearts in particular instances.\nTherefore, we affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.\nLARSEN and PAPADAKOS, JJ., file dissenting opinions.\n. The Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court on a pure question of law, accepting for the moment the facts as found by the trial judge. We also accept the trial judge\u2019s factual findings at face value, and our recounting of the facts herein should not be interpreted as a ruling on the City\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in support of these findings.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(1) provides that:\nThe following acts by a local agency or any of its employees may result in the imposition of liability on a local agency:\n(1) vehicle liability \u2014 The operation of any motor vehicle in the possession or control of the local agency. As used in this paragraph, \"motor vehicle\" means any vehicle which is self-propelled and any attachment thereto, including vehicles operated by rail, through water or in the air.\n. Since the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision on the immunity issue disposed of the case, the court did not reach the City's additional issues.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b).\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(1).\n. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1991.\n.
