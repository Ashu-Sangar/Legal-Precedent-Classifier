The City filed an answer alleging that Appellees\u2019 claim against it was barred by the City\u2019s government immunity conferred by the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act and moved for Judgment on the Pleadings.\nAppellee contested the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings arguing that pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(3), liability could be imposed against the City in regard to acts involving the \u201ccare, custody or control of real property in the possession of the local agency.\u201d Appellee alleged that her assault was related to the City\u2019s care, custody and control of its real property.\nThe Honorable Alfred J. DiBona, Jr. of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County granted the City\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings in a concise statement that \u201cfailure to supervise or provide adequate police protection is outside the waiver of immunity found at 53 P.S. \u00a7 5311.202 or 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8542(b).\u201d (Trial Court Opinion p. 1). Appellees filed an appeal to the Commonwealth Court which, by its opinion and order of September 11, 1985, reversed the order of the trial court and remanded the record to the trial court for further proceedings. Johnson v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, 91 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 587, 498 A.2d 22 (1985).\nIt was from that order that the City filed its Petition for Allowance of Appeal with this Court. Because of the importance of defining the extent to which the real estate exception to the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act could be invoked, we granted allocatur and, upon review, conclude that the Commonwealth Court was in error in reversing the trial court\u2019s entry of judgment on the pleadings and, accordingly, we now reverse.\nAs already noted, the gravaman of Appellees\u2019 complaint is that the criminal assault that Mrs. Johnson suffered in the subway was directly related to the care, custody or control of real estate in the possession of the City, and that liability can be imposed against the City pursuant to the real estate exception of the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(3). Appellees read the real estate exception to extend to injuries which occur on municipally controlled property and which stem from the inadequate control and supervision of persons who cause injuries to the public. We must disagree with Appellees\u2019 interpretation of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(3).\nWe have recently held that \u201cthe real estate exception can be applied only to those cases where it is alleged that the artificial condition or defect of the land itself causes the injury not merely when it facilitates the injury by the acts of others, whose acts are outside the statute\u2019s scope of liability.\u201d Mascaro v. Youth Study Center, 514 Pa. 351, 523 A.2d 1118 (1987).\nThere is no allegation in Appellees\u2019 complaint that she was injured by a defect of the land itself only that the condition of the land facilitated her injury by another. On these facts, no cause of action exists against the City for the injuries Mrs. Johnson suffered.\nWe find Mascaro to control the disposition of this case and, accordingly, reverse the Order and Opinion of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County granting the City\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.\nZAPPALA, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nHUTCHINSON, J., concurs in the result.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. SEPTA was not involved in the appeal taken to Commonwealth Court and similarly is not involved in this appeal.\n. The Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act in effect when Mrs. Johnson was attacked was the Act of November 26, 1978, P.L. 1399, as amended, 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5311.101-5311.803. This Act was repealed on October 5, 1980, and recodified with little substantive change at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8541, 8542.\n. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(3) provides in pertinent part:\n(b) Acts which may impose liability \u2014 The following acts by a local agency or any of its employees may result in the imposition of liability on a local agency:\n... (3) Real Property \u2014 The care, custody or control of real property in the possession of the local agency, except that the local agency shall not be liable for damages on account of any injury sustained by a person intentionally trespassing on real property in the possession of the local agency."}
