{"id": "1945637", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Robebts,\nAppellant, George Haideman, was tried by a jury and found guilty of bookmaldng, setting up a gambling establishment and conspiracy. He was sentenced to undergo imprisonment for six to twenty-three months and to pay a fine of $500.00. Following a per curiam affirmance by the Superior Court, we granted allocatur and, in a per curiam order, affirmed the conviction by an equally divided Court. Commonwealth v. Haide-\nman, 284 A. 2d 757 (1971). On March 21, 1972, however, we granted appellant\u2019s motion for reargument.\nThe issue presented is whether the trial court erred in permitting testimony that appellant, upon being advised of his Miranda rights, requested counsel and exercised his constitutional right to remain silent. The Commonwealth, in its case in chief, introduced the following testimony of Trooper Kardash: \u201cQ. When you say advised him of the Warrant and the reason of our business, what do you mean, Trooper Kardash? A. He read him his constitutional rights, and he read the Search Warrant to him and the Body Warrant. Q. When the constitutional rights were read to the defendant, did the defendmit say anything? A .He didn\u2019t say nothing; he calmed down and he shut up.\u201d Defense counsel immediately requested a sidebar conference and objected to such evidence. After a lengthy discussion, the trial court overruled the objection and denied the motion for mistrial. Subsequently, the Commonwealth called Trooper Purcell who testified: \u201cQ. What did you do as you entered? A. Again advised the subject of his constitutional rights, and asked him if he understood what I was speaking of, because naturally there is physical emotion and so forth involved, and he was more settled down, and he was advised of his constitutional rights, which he stated he understood, and also requested to remain mute pending counsel.\u201d\nTestimonial reference to an accused\u2019s silence and his request for a lawyer at time of arrest is a constitutionally impermissible violation of the accused\u2019s Fifth Amendment right.. In Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S. Ct. 1229 (1965), the Supreme Court held that the Fifth Amendment \u201cforbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence [at trial] or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt.\u201d Id. at 615, 85 S. Ct. at 1233.\nThe difference between prosecutorial use of an accused\u2019s silence at trial and the use of an accused\u2019s silence at time of arrest is, as one court stated, \u201cinfinitesimal.\u201d Gillison v. United States, 399 F. 2d 586, 587 (D.C. Cir. 1968). In both instances, the defendant\u2019s silence is exploited as evidence of guilt. As the Fifth Circuit observed, \u201c[w]e would be naive if we failed to recognize that most laymen view an assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege as a badge of guilt.\u201d Walker v. United States, 404 F. 2d 900, 903 (5th Cir. 1968). It is clear that \u201c[t]he privilege against self-incrimination would be reduced to a hollow mockery if its exercise could be taken as equivalent either to a confession of guilt or a conclusive presumption of perjury.\u201d Slochower v. Board of Higher Ed. of N.Y., 350 U.S. 551, 557, 76 S. Ct. 637, 641 (1956).\nThe Seventh Circuit in United States v. Kroslack, 426 F. 2d 1129 (7th Cir. 1970), relied on Griffin in concluding that testimony similar to that utilized here was inadmissible. That court said: \u201cIt was reversible error for the agent to testify that when the defendant was questioned he refused to make a statement. Baker v. United States, 5 Cir. 357 F. 2d 11 (1966). Defendant had a constitutional right to refuse to make a statement until his request that a lawyer be present was met. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1964). [sic] We find little difference between the prejudice resulting from the testimony admitted in the case before us, and a prosecutor\u2019s comment before a jury on a defendant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional right not to take the witness stand. Such comments have been held to be reversible error. Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106 (1965). The testimony elicited here could well have led the jury to infer guilt from defendant\u2019s refusal to make the statement. We think exercise of a constitutional privilege should not incur this penalty.\u201d Id. at 1130-31 (footnote omitted). Accord, United States v. Matos, 444 F. 2d 1071 (7th Cir. 1971); United States v. Arnold, 425 F. 2d 204 (10th Cir. 1970); Fowle v. United States, 410 F. 2d 48 (9th Cir. 1969); Walker v. United States, supra; Gillison v. United States, supra; Baker v. United States, 357 F, 2d 11 (5th Cir. 1966); Fagundes v. United States, 340 F. 2d 673 (1st Cir. 1965); People v. Lampson, 129 Ill. App. 2d 72, 262 N.E. 2d 601 (1970); People v. Abdul Karim Al-Kanani, 26 N.Y. 2d 473, 260 N.E. 2d 496 (1970); Galasso v. State, 207 So. 2d 45. (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1968); State v. Dearman, 198 Kan. 44, 422 P. 2d 573 (1967), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 895, 90 S. Ct. 194 (1969).\nIn Fowle v. United States, supra, the court rejected the use of evidence of an accused\u2019s silence at arrest as being constitutionally precluded because such evidence ignores his Fifth Amendment protection and prejudices this guaranteed right. That court reasoned: \u201cWe simply cannot adopt an interpretation of the Fifth Amendment under which one exercising his right to remain silent upon and immediately after his arrest\u2014a right which the Supreme Court has so . earnestly sought to guarantee and preserve\u2014is severely prejudiced by his recourse to that cherished right. It would be anomalous indeed if honorable law enforcement officers were required to elaborate upon the traditional fifth amendment warning and advise arrested persons, in effect: If you say anything, it may be used against you. You have the constitutional right to remain silent, but if you exercise it, that fact may be used against you.\u201d Fowle v. United States, 410 F. 2d at 54.\nThe conclusion we reach is compelled by the Supreme Court\u2019s explicit pronouncement that the prosecution may not\u2014as was done here\u2014introduce at trial the fact that the accused \u201cstood mute or claimed his privilege.\u201d In Miranda, the Court stated: \u201cIn accord with our decision today, it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privi-\nlege when he is under poliee custodial interrogation. The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation. Cf. Griffin v. State of California. . . .\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 468 n.37, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 1624-25 n.37 (1966) (emphasis added).\nIt must, therefore, be held that reversible error was committed in admitting, at trial, evidence of appellant\u2019s request for counsel and his silence at time of arrest. To permit such evidence would certainly impair and burden appellant\u2019s constitutional privilege and impose the very penalty which Miranda specifically forbids.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed, the judgment of sentence is vacated and a new trial granted.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones and Mr. Justice Pomeroy dissent.\nMr. Justice Eagen and Mr. Justice O\u2019Brien joined in the opinion of Mr. Justice Roberts which would have reversed the conviction and granted a new trial. That opinion stated \u201cthat any testimonial reference to an accused\u2019s silence and request for a lawyer at the time of arrest is reversible error, when made in the jury\u2019s presence and over timely objection. As aptly stated by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the factually similar ease of Baker v. United States, 357 F. 2d 11 (1966) : \u2018In asking for counsel before making any statement, appellant was exercising a Constitutional right which the Supreme Court has time and again declared to be guaranteed to all persons accused of crime. To have proven that appellant requested the right of counsel and thereafter made no further statement was, we feel, as objectionable as it would have been to comment on a defendant exercising his Constitutional right not to take the witness stand.' Id. at 13-14.\u201d Commonwealth v. Haideman, 284 A. 2d 757, 758 (1971).\nAppellant also contends that the court erred (1) by admitting into evidence certain incriminating statements; (2) by failing to submit the issue of voluntariness of the statements; (3) by failing to compel the Commonwealth to identify the informant; (4) by refusing a request for a suppression hearing; (5) by denying a request for a bill of particulars; (6) by failing to prove conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt; (7) by limiting defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination; (8) by permitting testimony that appellant was running a layoff house; and (9) by denying numerous motions for mistrial. In view of our disposition, we need not pass upon these challenges.\nMiranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966).\nThe Commonwealth suggests that evidence of appellant\u2019s silence and request for counsel is relevant for the purpose of showing that he was aware of the circumstances, notwithstanding his hysteria. Here, in fact, appellant did not challenge that he was informed of his rights and that he was aware of the police activity. Accordingly, \u201cthis testimony . . . did no more than turn on the red light of potential prejudice involving the defendant\u2019s fifth amendment rights.\u201d United States v. Arnold, 425 F. 2d 204, 206 (10th Cir. 1970)."}
