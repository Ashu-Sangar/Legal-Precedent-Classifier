{"id": "1763769", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nOn October 8, 1974, appellant William Starks was convicted by a jury of murder of the first degree and unlawfully carrying a firearm. He was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of life for the murder conviction and two and one-half to five years for the firearms conviction. On appeal, appellant claimed that his motion for mistrial on the ground of prosecutorial misconduct was improperly denied. This Court agreed with appellant and accordingly granted him a new trial. Commonwealth v. Starks, 479 Pa. 51, 387 A.2d 829 (1978).\nAppellant now contends by pre-trial motion that retrial would impermissibly place him twice in jeopardy. Appellant correctly states that prosecutorial misconduct which rises to the level of \u201coverreaching\u201d will bar retrial. See Lee v. United States, 432 U.S. 23, 97 S.Ct. 2141, 52 L.Ed.2d 80 (1977). Appellant claims here that the prosecutorial misconduct at his first trial, which resulted in this Court vacating judgments of sentence, constitutes prosecutorial overreaching. The court of common pleas disagreed and denied appellant\u2019s motion. We affirm.\nThe United States Constitution, amendment V declares that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb . . . .\u201d Pennsylvania likewise extends such protection to the accused. See Pa.Const., art. I, \u00a7 10; Commonwealth v. Campana, 455 Pa. 622, 314 A.2d 854 (1974). This proscription against double jeopardy means that no one should be harassed by successive prosecutions for a single wrongful act and that no one should be punished more than once for the same offense. See United States v. Wilson, 420 U.S. 332, 342-43, 95 S.Ct. 1013, 1021, 43 L.Ed.2d 232 (1975); Note, Statutory Implementation of Double Jeopardy Clauses: New Life for a Moribund Constitutional Guarantee, 65 Yale L.J. 339, 339-40 (1956). There can be no doubt that this constitutional protection is fundamental to our system of criminal justice, for, as the United States Supreme Court explained:\n\u201cThe underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d\nGreen v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 187, 78 S.Ct. 221, 223, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957); see Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 795-96, 89 S.Ct. 2056, 2063, 23 L.Ed.2d 707 (1969) (constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy applies to states because of its \u201cfundamental nature\u201d); Commonwealth v. Mills, 447 Pa. 163, 286 A.2d 638 (1971). As Mr. Chief Justice Burger wrote, a criminal proceeding \u201cimposes heavy pressures and burdens \u2014 psychological, physical, and financial\u2014 on a person charged. The purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause is to require that he be subject to the experience only once \u2018for the same offence.\u2019 \u201d Breed v. Jones, 421 U.S. 519, 530, 95 S.Ct. 1779, 1786, 44 L.Ed.2d 346 (1975).\nGenerally the double jeopardy clause does not bar retrial of a defendant who obtains a new trial upon his request for a mistrial. See Lee v. United States, supra at 32, 97 S.Ct. at 2147. As the Supreme Court explained in United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470, 485, 91 S.Ct. 547, 557, 27 L.Ed.2d 543 (1971) (plurality opinion) (Harlan, J.):\n\u201c[Wjhere circumstances develop not attributable to prosecutorial or judicial overreaching, a motion by the defendant for mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution, even if the defendant\u2019s motion is necessitated by prosecutorial or judicial error.\u201d\nThis restriction on the double jeopardy clause, however, is not without its own limitations. The Supreme Court has held that double jeopardy will bar retrial if the defendant sought the mistrial as a result of prosecutorial misconduct amounting to overreaching. See Lee v. United States, supra at 32, 97 S.Ct. at 2147; United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 611, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 1081, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976). So too, where, on prosecutorial misconduct grounds, a defendant unsuccessfully moves for a mistrial but then obtains appellate relief, the double jeopardy clause will not bar retrial unless the misconduct amounts to overreaching. Our inquiry here, therefore, is, as the Commonwealth agrees, whether the prosecutorial misconduct at appellant\u2019s first trial, which we held to be reversible error, see Commonwealth v. Starks, supra, constitutes prosecutorial overreaching.\nThe United States Supreme Court has enunciated principally two types of prosecutorial overreaching. First there is the prosecutorial misconduct which is designed to provoke a mistrial in order to secure a second, perhaps more favorable, opportunity to convict the defendant. See United States v. Dinitz, supra at 611, 96 S.Ct. at 1081. Second there is the prosecutorial misconduct undertaken in bad faith to prejudice or harass the defendant. See Lee v. United States, supra at 32, 97 S.Ct. at 2147; United States v. Dinitz, supra at 611, 96 S.Ct. at 1081-82. In contrast to prosecutorial error, overreaching is not an inevitable part of the trial process and cannot be condoned. It signals the breakdown of the integrity of the judicial proceeding, and represents the type of prosecutorial tactic which the double jeopardy clause was designed to protect against.\nThis Court has expressly announced that in \u201cadvocating the cause for this Commonwealth, prosecutors are to seek justice, not only convictions.\u201d Commonwealth v. Cherry, 474 Pa. 295, 301, 378 A.2d 800, 803 (1977) (citations omitted). Indeed, a prosecutor\n\u201cis the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a particular and very definite sense the servant of the law . . . .\u201d\nBerger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 633, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935). This Court in holding that the prosecutorial misconduct at appellant\u2019s first trial was reversible error, identified two instances of misconduct in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. First, we found that the prosecutor\u2019s expressions of personal belief concerning a critical issue in the case, the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s confession, violated our standards of permissible conduct. See Commonwealth v. Starks, supra 479 Pa. at 57, 387 A.2d at 832. Second we found that the prosecutor unnecessarily emphasized the involvement of drugs in the case. See id., 479 Pa. at 57-58, 387 A.2d at 832-33.\nAlthough these instances of misconduct cannot be and were not condoned, and clearly required reversal of appellant\u2019s convictions, they do not constitute overreaching. The prosecutor\u2019s emphasis of drug involvement was in part a response to the intemperate closing argument of defense counsel, see ABA Standards Relating to The Prosecution Function and The Defense Function \u00a7 7.8 (Approved Draft, 1971) (Defense Argument to Jury), and in part an attempt to explain appellant\u2019s choice of vocabulary in his confession. Moreover, appellant\u2019s confession suggested that a drug transaction supplied the motive for the murder, and to this extent the issue of drug use was properly before the jury. In light of these circumstances, it must be concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s emphasis on drug use had some basis in trial strategy, and cannot be considered to be an attempt to provoke a mistrial or a bad faith attempt to prejudice appellant.\nSo too, the prosecutor\u2019s expressions of personal belief as to the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s confession, while error and impermissible, do not constitute overreaching. The voluntariness issue was properly before the jury, and the prosecutor\u2019s statements themselves simply do not suggest a bad faith effort to prejudice or an intent to provoke mistrial. Accordingly, we agree with the court of common pleas that the prosecutorial misconduct in this case, though impermissible, does not amount to prosecutorial overreaching and that the Commonwealth is therefore not precluded from retrying appellant. Accord Commonwealth v. Lee, 490 Pa. 346, 416 A.2d 503 (1980).\nOrder affirmed and case remanded for appropriate proceedings.\nLARSEN, J., concurs in the result.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Under Commonwealth v. Haefner, 473 Pa. 154, 373 A.2d 1094 (1977) and Commonwealth v. Bolden, 472 Pa. 602, 373 A.2d 90 (1977) (plurality opinion), a defendant may appeal an order denying his pre-trial motion for relief under the double jeopardy clause.\n. As we stated in Starks, with respect to the prosecutor\u2019s expressions of personal belief:\n\u201cIn response to [the defendant\u2019s charge that his statement was coerced by the police] . . . , the assistant district attorney in his closing address to the jury stated: \u2018. . think the worst about Detective Morris and think the worst about Detective Richardson, but for Christ\u2019s sake, you cannot believe they were born yesterday.\u2019 Again, he adjured, \u2018If you believe that Detective Richardson and Detective Morris engaged in beating this defendant and beat him into signing a paper that they prepared, that were not the words of this defendant, I want you to understand, I mean, I want you to send him home . . . God help us if the police are going to do what the defendant says. If that is what you believe, ladies and gentlemen, not only let the defendant go, but I would be concerned about staying around myself.\u2019 \u201d\n. As we explained in Starks, with respect to the prosecutor\u2019s statements about drugs:\n\u201c[T]hroughout the closing argument, the prosecutor repeatedly spoke of the defendant as a \u2018pusher\u2019 and a \u2018dealer\u2019:\n\u2018Don\u2019t you think that would be fairer, be fairer to the cocaine pusher, to the cocaine distributor. Don\u2019t you think that would be fairer?\u2019 (Trial Record at 482-483)\n\u2018When the police have a cocaine pusher, cocaine distributor who is involved in the killing of a cocaine pusher on the streets, because the pusher welshed on the deal involving a shipment of cocaine, if you believe that fairness after the defendant has been duly warned, not just by the police but by a defense lawyer that he does not have to talk if he does not want to. . .\u2019 (Trial Record at 481)\nThe drug issue was further emphasized when the assistant district attorney stated:\n\u2018So, I don\u2019t come to this case with what I regard as extraneous principles of philosophy. I come to this case with the cruel, hard knowledge that it is just not this defendant who is supplying the drugs, it is just not Benny Fields who is out there pushing them, it is that somewhere, and I know it, I have seen them, there is some child whose body is being polluted right now by those drugs, right now. Don\u2019t you see, that sight, the sight of that child, that affects my view of what is fair. The sight of that child does have an influence on me, but that kind of fairness has no place in the case. This business about the*bankers and the like, all that philosophy has no place in the case. The law is what governs the facts as you find them.\u2019 (Trial Record at 482-483)\u201d"}
