{"id": "1767218", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nBeaver County Children and Youth Services appeals from a final decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County denying its petition for involuntary termination of the parental rights of V.G., the natural mother of I.L.G. The orphans\u2019 court found that \u201cthe record clearly established that [V.G.] failed to perform her parental duties for a period of at least six months.\u201d See Adoption Act of 1970, Act. of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, \u00a7 311(1), 1 P.S. \u00a7 311(1) (Supp.1980). According to the orphans\u2019 court findings, for nine months, despite repeated communications from Children and Youth Services, V.G. neither asserted nor evinced an interest in I.L.G. Despite its findings, supported by the record, that V.G. failed to perform parental duties for the statutory period, the court refused to terminate V.G.\u2019s parental rights. It did so on the ground that Children and Youth Services failed to render rehabilitative services to V.G. \u201cor at the very least inform [V.G.] of the possible consequences of her failure to perform her parental duties.\u201d\nThe findings of the orphans\u2019 court, supported by the record, may not be disturbed:\n\u201c[I]n reviewing the decision of the orphans\u2019 court, [this Court\u2019s] task is to assure that the record is free from legal error and to determine if the chancellor\u2019s findings are supported by competent and adequate evidence, and are not predicated upon capricious disbelief of competent and credible evidence.\u201d\nCohen Will, 445 Pa. 549, 550, 284 A.2d 754, 755 (1971). Accord, e. g., Hamill Estate, 487 Pa. 592, 410 A.2d 770 (1980); In re C.A.W., 487 Pa. 163, 409 A.2d 16 (1979). Our inquiry here centers upon whether the orphans\u2019 court committed an error of law in refusing to terminate V.G.\u2019s parental rights even though it found she failed to perform her parental duties for the requisite statutory period. It must be concluded that, based on the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s supported findings, the orphans\u2019 court erred in not terminating parental rights.\nThe orphans\u2019 court\u2019s refusal to terminate parental rights on the basis of the claimed failure of Children and Youth Services to provide rehabilitative services to V.G. is contrary to the Adoption Act of 1970 and our case law. Quite recently, in In re I.R.A., 487 Pa. 563, 410 A.2d 755 (1980), this Court rejected imposition of the very duty to provide rehabilitative services which the orphans\u2019 court here sought to impose:\n\u201cSection 311 of the Adoption Act contains no express requirement that child care agencies offer rehabilitative services to parents. The focus of a termination proceeding is upon the conduct of parents. We see no basis for reading into Section 311 a legislative intent that offering rehabilitative services to parents be a prerequisite to petitioning for termination. Appellant cites Title 4300, \u00a7\u00a7 4302 and 4332, of the Department of Public Welfare Regulations as printed in the Children and Youth Manual and entitled \u2018Foster Family Care Under Social Service Auspices\u2019 as requiring that assistance be offered to parents of children in foster care. Notwithstanding, the burden is upon parents to meet their affirmative duties under Section 311: proof of rehabilitative aid having been offered is not a prerequisite to termination of parental rights under the statutory scheme.\u201d\n487 Pa. at 567, 410 A.2d at 757 (footnote omitted). See also In re W.M. III, 482 Pa. 123, 127-28, 393 A.2d 410, 412 (1978). We hold here, as in I.R.A., that \u201cproof of rehabilitative aid having been offered is not a prerequisite to termination of parental rights under the statutory scheme.\u201d\nSo too, neither the Adoption Act of 1970 nor our case law permits a refusal to terminate parental rights because Children and Youth Services did not \u201cinform [V.G.] of the possible consequences of her failure to perform her parental duties.\u201d Refusal to terminate on this ground reflects a misperception of the affirmative parental duties under the Adoption Act. As this Court has stated,\n\u201cA child needs love, protection, guidance, and support. These needs, physical and emotional, cannot be met by a merely passive interest in the development of the child. Thus, this Court has held that the parental obligation is a positive duty which requires affirmative performance. In re Adoption of Orwick, 464 Pa. 549, 347 A.2d 677 (1976); In re Adoption of Mahlon Nichelle McCray, 460 Pa. 210, 331 A.2d 652 (1975); Appeal of Diane B., 456 Pa. 429, 321 A.2d 618 (1974); In re Smith\u2019s Adoption, 412 Pa. 501, 194 A.2d 919 (1963). This affirmative duty encompasses more than a financial obligation; it requires continuing interest in the child and a genuine effort to maintain communication and association with the child. In re Adoption of Mahlon Nichelle McCray, supra; Appeal of Diane B., supra; In re Adoption of Jagodzinski, 444 Pa. 511, 281 A.2d 868 (1971). Because a child needs more than a benefactor, parental duty requires that a parent \u2018exert himself to take and maintain a place of importance in the child\u2019s life.\u2019 Appeal of Diane B., supra, 456 Pa. at 433, 321 A.2d at 620, quoting In Re: Adoption of J.R.F., 27 Somerset L.J. 298, 304-05 (Pa.C.P.1972).\n******\n[P]arental rights may not be preserved by \u2018waiting for some more suitable financial circumstance or convenient time for the performance of parental duties and responsibilities (while others adequately provide the child with [his or] her immediate and continuing physical and emotional needs).\u2019 In re Smith\u2019s Adoption, 412 Pa. at 505, 194 A.2d 922. Parental duty does not require the impossible but may encompass that which is difficult and demanding. A parent may not yield to every problem, but must act affirmatively, with good faith interest and effort, to maintain the parent-child relationship to the best of his or her ability, even in difficult circumstances. See In re Adoption of Orwick, supra; In re Adoption of Mahlon Nichelle McCray, supra; In Re: Adoption of J.R.F., supra.\u201d\nIn re Burns, 474 Pa. 615, 624-25 & 626, 379 A.2d 535, 540 & 541 (1977). Our courts are without authority to engraft upon the Adoption Act a provision conditioning a parent\u2019s obligation to perform affirmative parental duties only upon \u201cwarning\u201d by a children services agency. This the Legislature did not do and we may not intrude into this exclusive province of legislative judgment. As Justice Holmes observed in Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway Company v. May, 194 U.S. 267, 270, 24 S.Ct. 638, 639, 48 L.Ed. 971 (1904), \u201clegislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.\u201d See In re William L., 477 Pa. 322, 339, 383 A.2d 1228, 1236, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 880, 99 S.Ct. 216, 58 L.Ed.2d 192 (1978). See also In re L.L.D., 492 Pa. 454, 424 A.2d 1278 (1980).\nDecree reversed. Each party pay own costs.\nNIX, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nSection 311(1) of the Adoption Act of 1970 provides that parental rights may be involuntarily terminated where\n\u201c[t]he parent by conduct continuing for a period of at least six months either has evidenced a settled purpose of relinquishing parental claim to the child, or has refused or failed to perform parental duties____\u201d\nThis section permits termination of parental rights upon a showing of either the parent\u2019s settled purpose to relinquish parental claims to the child, or a refusal or failure to perform parental duties for six months. See In re Adoption of McCray, 460 Pa. 210, 215 n.6, 331 A.2d 652, 654 n.6 (1975)."}
