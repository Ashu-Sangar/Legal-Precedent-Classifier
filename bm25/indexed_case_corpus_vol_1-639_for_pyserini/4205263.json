{"id": "4205263", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nThe Commonwealth appeals from the portion of the Superi- or Court order reversing appellee Daniel Sinnott\u2019s conviction for ethnic intimidation on the basis of insufficient evidence. We reverse, and reinstate that conviction and judgment of sentence.\nAt about 11:80 a.m. on May 21, 2007, the victim, Evelyn Rojas, was visiting her mother when she heard screaming and cursing outside the house. When Rojas went outside to investigate, she found appellee, a tenant and employee of her father, throwing power tools her father had given him against the concrete steps. When Rojas asked appellee what was wrong, he said her father cheated him, he was going to take every house her father owned, and then told her, \u201c[Y]ou, MF\u2019ers, are going to have to go back to Mexico, you wetbacks.\u201d N.T. Trial, 11/26/07, at 9. He also called Rojas a \u201cfucking bitch\u201d and \u201cfucking whore.\u201d Id., at 9-10. Rojas told appellee she was not Mexican, but Puerto Rican, and therefore had as much right to be in the United States as he did; appellee replied, \u201cNo you don\u2019t, you wetback, go back to the Alamo.\u201d Id., at 10. Rojas testified appellee kept talking about the Alamo and how her father \u201cdid him dirty,\u201d id., and threatened to kill her father for cheating him. Rojas and her mother managed to pacify appellee, who went back inside his house.\nWhen appellee emerged again and approached the women, he was wielding a power drill, which he kept revving. He walked around the block for about 45 minutes, and Rojas called the police. Meanwhile, appellee returned to his house, opened his front window, and pretended to videotape the two women. The police arrived when appellee was still inside his house; however, when they left, he came back outside with the drill in one hand and a hammer in the other. He quickly approached the women, advancing towards Rojas as if he were going to hit her with the hammer; she instinctively put her hands up to stop him. Her long nails got caught in his shirt, and as the two struggled, four of her nails were ripped from their nail beds, causing her fingers to bleed.\nAppellee retreated into his house, and the police returned. Appellee would not come out, but spoke to the officers through the open window, telling them to check Rojas\u2019 \u201cgreen card.\u201d Id., at 17. Once police gained entry into the house, they found a power drill on the floor next to appellee and arrested him.\nAppellee was charged with simple assault, terroristic threats, ethnic intimidation, and possession of instruments of crime. He waived his right to a jury, and the trial court convicted him of all offenses, sentencing him to four to 23 months imprisonment for simple assault and a consecutive four years probation for terroristic threats; no further penalty was imposed.\nAppellee appealed, challenging the sufficiency of the evidence in support of his terroristic threats and ethnic intimidation convictions. In a published opinion, the Superior Court affirmed the terroristic threats conviction, but reversed the conviction for ethnic intimidation, concluding the record failed to establish Rojas\u2019 ethnicity was the \u201cprimary basis\u201d for appellee\u2019s behavior. Commonwealth v. Sinnott, 976 A.2d 1184, 1189 (Pa.Super.2009). The court noted penal statutes are to be strictly construed, id., at 1190 (citing 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(b)(1)), and opined 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2710\u2019s requirement that the underlying offense be committed with \u201cmalicious intention\u201d towards the victim\u2019s ethnicity could be met \u201conly where the circumstances establish that the defendant was motivated by animus toward the victim\u2019s race or ethnicity and targeted the victim expressly on that basis.\u201d Sinnott, at 1190 (emphasis in original) (citing In re M.J.M., 858 A.2d 1259, 1267 (Pa.Super.2004); Commonwealth v. Ferino, 433 Pa.Super. 306, 640 A.2d 934, 938 (1994), affirmed by an equally divided court, 540 Pa. 51, 655 A.2d 506, 507 (1995); Commonwealth v. Rink, 393 Pa.Super. 554, 574 A.2d 1078, 1084 (1990)).\nThe Superior Court concluded the record supported appellee\u2019s contention that his ethnically derogatory remarks and threatening behavior were the product of circumstances unrelated to the victim\u2019s race, ie., appellee\u2019s anger with the victim\u2019s father over their employment relationship. Examining the statute\u2019s language, the court stated it was \u201cnot convinced of the provision\u2019s applicability where the testimony and circumstances suggest a more limited motivation.\u201d Id. Thus, the court held although appellee\u2019s anger did not justify his repeated use of ethnically derogatory terms, it did suggest that his commission of the underlying offense (terroristic threats) \u201cwas driven principally by factors other than the [victim\u2019s] ethnicity.\u201d Id., at 1191 (emphasis added). Accordingly, the court reversed appellee\u2019s ethnic intimidation conviction.\nThe Commonwealth petitioned for allowance of appeal, which we granted, to determine:\nWhether, to prove ethnic intimidation pursuant to 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 2710, the Commonwealth must prove the defendant targeted the victim solely based on the victim\u2019s race, color, religion, or national origin.\nCommonwealth v. Sinnott, 605 Pa. 455, 991 A.2d 305, 305 (2010).\nAs the proper construction of a statute involves a question of law, see Commonwealth v. Bavusa, 574 Pa. 620, 832 A.2d 1042, 1049 (2003), our scope of review is plenary, and our standard of review is de novo. See Commonwealth v. Santiago, 602 Pa. 159, 978 A.2d 349, 352 n. 4 (2009). \u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). When a statute\u2019s words \u201care clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d Id., \u00a7 1921(b). Penal statutes are to be strictly construed, id., \u00a7 1928(b)(1), and the Crimes Code states its provisions are to be \u201cconstrued according to the fair import of their terms but when the language is susceptible of differing constructions it shall be interpreted to further the general purposes stated in this title and the special purposes of the particular provision involved.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 105.\nThe ethnic intimidation statute provides:\n(a) Offense defined. \u2014 A person commits the offense of ethnic intimidation if, with malicious intention toward the race, color, religion or national origin of another individual or group of individuals, he commits an offense under any other provision of this article ... with respect to such individual or his or her property or with respect to one or more members of such group or to their property.\n(c) Definition. \u2014 As used in this section \u201cmalicious intention\u201d means the intention to commit any act, the commission of which is a necessary element of any offense referred to in subsection (a) motivated by hatred toward the race, color, religion or national origin of another individual or group of individuals.\nId., \u00a7 2710(a), (c) (emphasis added).\nThe Commonwealth contends the Superior Court erred in interpreting the ethnic intimidation statute to require that the defendant commit the predicate crime with a single and exclusive improper motive, i.e., ethnic hatred. It argues the co-existence of other motives along with malicious intent toward the victim\u2019s ethnicity does not negate the element of malicious intent; the presence of multiple motives does not diminish the sufficiency of any individual motive. Here, the Commonwealth claims appellee possessed the requisite malicious intent toward the victim\u2019s ethnicity, along with his anger with her father. Thus, the Commonwealth argues, appellee\u2019s hatred toward the victim\u2019s national origin should not be negated by the additional fact that he was angry with her father.\nThe Commonwealth further contends the Superior Court erroneously relied on Ferino, which is not only distinguishable on its facts, but also wrongly decided. Finally, the Commonwealth posits the Superior Court improperly invaded the fact-finder\u2019s province by choosing which of appellee\u2019s two existing motives for the predicate offense was dominant.\nAppellee contends \u00a7 2710 requires the victim be selected because of animus toward the victim\u2019s ethnicity. Appearing to concede such animus need not be the defendant\u2019s sole motivation for committing the predicate offense, he contends some animus must exist, and such motivation was absent in his case. He claims his sole motivation for his conduct toward the victim was his anger with her father, and as in Ferino, there was no evidence of ethnic hatred behind his actions.\nNeither the Superior Court nor this Court has specifically addressed the instant issue. Ferino, cited by the Superior Court, involved the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s singular use of the word \u201cnigger\u201d while firing a gun at two victims, one of whom was Caucasian and one of whom was African-American, was sufficient to support a conviction of ethnic intimidation. The Superior Court observed \u00a7 2710 requires that in the course of committing the predicate offense, \u201cthe actor must manifest a malicious intent toward the intended victim and have as its motivation the hatred of the victim\u2019s \u2018race, color, religion or national origin.\u2019 \u201d Ferino, at 937 (quoting 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2710(a), (c)). This is an accurate summation of \u00a7 2710\u2019s malicious intent requirement, which does not imply ethnic malice must be the sole motivator. Rather, the Ferino court concluded the evidence was insufficient because, based on the unique facts, there was no ethnic malice found present at all. The defendant\u2019s comment was singular, his conduct was isolated, and his words and behavior were directed at both victims, only one of whom was black. Under these circumstances, the court concluded the evidence was insufficient to show a racial motivation for the underlying offense of terroristic threats. Id., at 938. This Court, being evenly divided, affirmed by per curiam order. Here, unlike Ferino, appellee\u2019s ethnic epithets were repeated numerous times over an extended period of time, and were specifically directed at the victim during the commission of the underlying offenses; therefore, Ferino is distinguishable on its facts.\nThe Court of Appeals of Michigan has examined a similar issue; its decision, although not binding, is instructive. In People v. Schutter, 265 Mich.App. 423, 695 N.W.2d 360 (2005), the court addressed \u201cwhether the [ethnic intimidation] statute requires the intent to intimidate or harass to be the sole motivating factor for the underlying criminal act or whether the requisite intent can be formed during the commission of the underlying criminal act, whatever the reason for the underlying predicate criminal act.\u201d Id., at 362.\nSchutter involved an incident of road rage, where the Caucasian defendants and African-American victim almost collided. Both parties continued driving, shouting racial slurs at one another and eventually stopping near each other. More racial slurs were exchanged before the victim threw a punch at the defendants, who responded by severely beating the victim, uttering additional racial slurs as they did so. Charged with ethnic intimidation, and assault and battery, they argued there was no evidence they selected the victim because of his race; rather, they contended he became their victim because he followed them, got out of his car, and threw a punch at them. They claimed the racial epithets they shouted during the beating were merely incidental to the physical contact and were not indicative of race-based selection of the victim.\nThe Michigan Court of Appeals rejected this argument, noting its ethnic intimidation statute:\nrequires an actor to cause physical contact with another person \u201cmaliciously, and with specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person\u2019s race.... \u201d This statutory language is rather straightforward and broad. It contains no limiting language to suggest that ethnic intimidation may only be charged when the specific intent to intimidate or harass is the sole reason for the underlying criminal act. Instead, the statute only requires some act of physical contact committed maliciously and accompanied by a specific intent to intimidate or harass because of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin. The circuit court properly interpreted the statute as being satisfied if this specific intent is formed during the commission of the underlying criminal act. That is so regardless of any other additional motivations for the underlying criminal act that may have existed earlier.\nId., at 363-64 (quoting Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.147b(l)(a)). The court held \u201cthat what may have started out as merely road rage escalated into an act of ethnic intimidation.\u201d Id., at 364. Thus, the court concluded the evidence was sufficient to bind the defendants over for trial on ethnic intimidation charges.\nAs in Sehutter, the language of our ethnic intimidation statute is straightforward and broad: an actor who commits one of the predicate offenses \u201cwith malicious intention toward the race, color, religion or national origin\u201d of the victim is guilty. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2710(a). Malicious intention is defined as \u201cthe intention to commit any act ... motivated by hatred toward the [victim\u2019s] race, color, religion or national origin....\u201d Id., \u00a7 2710(c). Neither definition contains limiting language such as \u201csolely\u201d or \u201conly\u201d; all that is required is that the ethnically malicious intent be present, concurrent with the underlying criminal act. The legislature could have easily inserted specific language to require the ethnically malicious intent be the sole motivation behind the criminal act; however, it did not.\nHuman beings may act with a single, exclusive motive; they may act for multiple reasons. Where one intent is criminal under \u00a7 2710 and the other not, the question is not which is primary or dominant. If the evidence of criminal intent (here, racial animus) is sufficiently established, it cannot be negated by establishing that a second intent coexisted in the mind of the actor. Such a rule would lead to an absurd result which the legislature did not intend. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1) (legislature does not intend result that is absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable). Accordingly, we hold \u00a7 2710\u2019s intent element is satisfied if there is evidence that ethnic malice was a motivator for the defendant\u2019s criminal act; it need not be the sole motivator.\nFurthermore, we note the Superior Court, in crediting appellee\u2019s explanation for his attack on the victim, did not apply the proper standard of review. In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, an appellate court is to consider the evidence admitted at trial and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner. Commonwealth v. Ratsamy, 594 Pa. 176, 934 A.2d 1233, 1237 (2007). An appellate court may not substitute its judgment for that of the fact-finder; the critical inquiry is not whether the court believes the evidence established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether the evidence believed by the fact-finder was sufficient to support the verdict. Id., at 1235-36. The proper question is not whether the defendant\u2019s contentions are supported by the record, but whether the verdict is so supported.\nEvidence existed that appellee was motivated by racial animus; he made repeated references to the victim\u2019s national origin (albeit mistaken) while behaving in a physically menacing manner, committing an assault on her, which he did not contest. Evidence also existed that appellee was motivated by his anger with the victim\u2019s father; during the incident, he asserted her father had cheated him. However, the victim was not the father but the daughter. The trial court, as the fact-finder, concluded sufficient evidence existed to conclude that appellee\u2019s conduct was motivated by malicious intent toward the victim\u2019s ethnicity.\nIn crediting appellee\u2019s contention that his conduct was solely motivated by anger with the victim\u2019s father, the Superi- or Court not only imposed a non-existing requirement that racial animus be the sole or primary motivator, but also failed to view the evidence of appellee\u2019s repeated derogatory ethnic slurs in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner.\nAccordingly, we reverse the portion of the Superior Court\u2019s order reversing appellee\u2019s ethnic intimidation conviction, and reinstate the judgment of sentence for that offense. In all other aspects, the order is affirmed.\nOrder affirmed in part, reversed in part; jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices SAYLOR, BAER, TODD, McCAFFERY and ORIE MELVIN join the opinion.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2701.\n. Id., \u00a7 2706.\n. Id., \u00a7 2710.\n. Id., \u00a7 907.\n. This language reflects the statute as originally enacted. See Act of 1982, June 18, P.L. 537, No. 154, \u00a7 1. The language was amended in 2002 to include additional categories of protected persons, see Act of 2002, Dec. 3, P.L. 1176, No. 143, \u00a7 1; however, the amendment was subsequently deemed unconstitutional. See Marcavage v. Rendell, 936 A.2d 188, 193-94 (Pa.Cmwlth.2007), affirmed, 597 Pa. 371, 951 A.2d 345, 346 (2008) (per curiam). Thus, appellee\u2019s conviction was under the statute without amendment.\n. Our grant of review did not encompass whether an exception for isolated or singular evidence of ethnic malice exists, and we decline to reconsider the issue at this time.\n. The statute\u2019s full text provides:\n(1) A person is guilty of ethnic intimidation if that person maliciously, and with specific intent to intimidate or harass another person because of that person\u2019s race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, does any of the following:\n(a) Causes physical contact with another person.\n(b) Damages, destroys, or defaces any real or personal property of another person.\n(c) Threatens, by word or act, to do an act described in subdivision (a) or (b), if there is reasonable cause to believe that an act described in subdivision (a) or (b) will occur.\nMich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.147b(l)(a).\n. Because the trial court imposed no sentence for appellee's ethnic intimidation conviction, remand for resentencing is unnecessary. See Sinnott, at 1191 n. 2."}
