{"id": "983305", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nAided by tlie able argument of the learned counsel for appellants, we have examined this record, with special reference to the several assignments of error, and have reached the conclusion that there is nothing in either of them that would justify a reversal of the judgment. The case hinged on the alleged agreement referred to in that part of the learned judge\u2019s charge, recited in the second specification, wherein he says: \u201c This presents a very important question of fact to be decided by the jury. If is alleged by the plaintiff that there was an agreement between him and the defendant that, in case Harris did not pay the rent, the defendant would not take plaintiff\u2019s goods in satisfaction of the rent. The defendant denies that such an agreement was made, and, upon the one side and the other, certain circumstances have been called to your attention, tending to corroborate the respective parties in their allegations upon this subject. You are to decide the question,\u2014was that agreement made or was it not?\u201d\nThe submission of this question was warranted by the evidence, and the verdict for plaintiff necessarily implies that the fact was found by the jury against the defendant. The second and other specifications involving substantially the same question are not sustained.\nIt follows that there was no error in submitting the question of damages to the jury; nor is there any error in the instructions as to the measure of damages.\nIn the circumstances, there was no error in admitting in evidence the testimony of Mrs. Perrin, given at the previous trial.\nNeither of the specifications of error is sustained.\nJudgment affirmed."}
