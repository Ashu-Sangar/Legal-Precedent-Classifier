{"id": "485218", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nWe granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal from the order of the Superior Court to determine whether, under the procedure established by the Act of December 22, 1965, P.L. 1187, \u00a7 1, 19 P.S. \u00a7 890 (Supp. 1974), a sentencing court may, in imposing sentence, consider a defendant\u2019s arrest record which does not indicate the disposition resulting from the arrests. Our review of the record, however, discloses that this issue was not preserved for appellate review by a timely objection in the sentencing court. We will not, therefore, consider appellant\u2019s claim. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 36 n. 3, 331 A.2d 213, 215 n. 3 (1975); Commonwealth v. Powell, 459 Pa. 253, 261, 328 A.2d 507, 511 (1974); Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974). On this record the order of the Superior Court must be affirmed.\nOrder affirmed.\nNIX, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case."}
