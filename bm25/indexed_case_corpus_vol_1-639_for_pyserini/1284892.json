{"id": "1284892", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThis is an appeal from the action of the court below in ordering a new trial after a jury had awarded verdicts in the amount of $10,000 to the minor plaintiff and $200 to plaintiff\u2019s parents.\nThe court below in its opinion stated:\n\u201cThe testimony produced by the plaintiffs shows that the minor plaintiff, then six years old, was struck by defendant\u2019s car on July 25th, 1954 while he was crossing Braddock Avenue and Eight Street, in the Borough of Braddock; that he was taken to the Braddock General Hospital and was kept under hospital care until August 1st, 1954, when he was removed to his home. . . .\n\u201cThe mother of the minor testified that the boy was under the care of Dr. Milton . Ohetlin while in the Braddock Hospital and for a short period thereafter and that the child was referred to Dr. David Kosskoff. At the trial, Dr. Chetlin was not called to testify, it being explained that he was then in the State of Florida.\n\u201cThe mother of the injured boy testified that he failed to recognize her after the accident until the afternoon of the next day; that he remained in the hospital for one week and was taken home, where he remained in bed for two weeks; that he experienced night spells, during which he would sit up in bed, shake and tremble; that the boy entered the first grade in the public schooi in September; that his memory was not so good; that he was slower in school and couldn\u2019t grasp like other children and that his grades went down and he missed school during the first year after the accident because of headaches.\n\u201cDr. Kosskoff was the sole medical witness called by- the plaintiffs. He testified that he first saw the minor plaintiff on February 2nd, 1955; that he received a report of the accident and the history from the father; that the child was unconscious for about a half hour and, since the accident, he had' complained of pains in the back of his head and that he was quite sluggish and suffered from night attacks, occurring since the accident once or twice every two weeks, which were characterized by shaking and trembling in the extremities, getting out of bed and and walking about, after which he had complete amnesia of these events.\n\u201cOn February 11, 1955, Dr. Kosskoff performed an electroencephalogram, which was not successful; another one was performed on February 18, 1955, from which he found that the child had a borderline normal record, that is, while there was no pathological record in terms of actual pathology, he felt it was not perfectly normal, at least as normal as it should have been for the boy\u2019s age with this kind of recording and that the boy\u2019s behavior could be associated with this type of recording.\n\u201cOn February 28, 1958 another electroencephalogram was performed, at which time he received from the father a small follow-up history that the child continued to have nocturnal habits of crying and terror and continued to have headaches which have improved. This electroencephalogram was normal and showed that the child had recovered from his initial borderline changes, indicated by the previous record.\n\u201cDr. Kosskoff was of opinion that the child had suffered a cerebral contusion at the time of the accident; that the changes in his behavior were the result of the contusion and that the child had made a relatively favorable clinical recovery. However, he was of the opinion that a blow of this kind to the child\u2019s nervous system and to his emotional stability could alter his general emotional growth; also his ability to work at school, in his thought processes and that the child should have more or less follow-up care in the future. \u2022\n\u201cIt appears that the Doctor\u2019s diagnosis depended heavily upon the history given to him by the child\u2019s parents. His testimony stresses the importance of this history: \u2018if, as you described, the history indicates a confusional state, and the general picture as I have developed. ... I mean if we had another type of history and we saw this record in this child we could assume this was a variant that would not have any significance. . . . [W]e are relying not only on the history that the parents tell us, but the history of the accident, the severity of the blow. This is assuming all this is correct. T'he fact that the child was apparently confused for at least 36 hours. ... It was reported that the child was unconscious, at least in our records, for about a half hour. ... In the history, we like to know the state of consciousness, which is one of the best criteria for concussion as an entity.\u2019\n\u201cIt appears to us from the testimony presented in this case that Dr. Kosskoff was not given an accurate history. The hospital records disclose that the child was not unconscious; in fact, the record indicated that the injuries were bruises, brush burns and a mild concussion. There is no testimony to support the history given to the Doctor to the effect that the child had been confused for about thirty-six hours.\n\u201cThe history concerning the child\u2019s slowness at school, his inability to learn like other children, the lower grades received and the time lost is at variance with the facts as disclosed from the school records, which show that the child did not miss a single day\u2019s school the entire year after the accident; that he was a straight-A student and that in January 1955 he scored 127 on an I. Q. test in a district where the score of 100 is considered very good. Furthermore, his teacher\u2019s entry on the record concerning his behavior was: \u2018Talkative; takes directions well.\u2019 \u201d\nAn examination of the instant record clearly and frankly reveals that plaintiffs\u2019 sole medical witness was compelled to rely upon a medical history of the child-plaintiff as related to him by others as the basis for his diagnosis and for his opinion as to the cause of and the extent of the child-plaintiff\u2019s injuries and physical condition. The record further reveals that the medical history as given to the medical witness was not only inaccurate but contrary to the facts as disclosed by the evidence. Under such circumstances we cannot find that the court below abused its discretion in granting a new trial. As we recently stated in Smith v. L. Blum berg\u2019s Son, Inc., 388 Pa. 146, 151, 130 A. 2d 437: \u201cA reading of the medical testimony presented on behalf of the plaintiff \u2014 even without considering the medical evidence presented by the defendant \u2014 raises very serious doubt as to whether it could justify the verdict. When to this bare record is added the lower Court\u2019s disbelief in the reliability or credibility of plaintiff and \u2022his doctors, it is impossible for us to say that there had been an abuse of discretion in granting a new trial. . . . \u201cThe rule is well settled that where a trial Judge or Court, who saw and heard the witnesses grants a new trial, we will not reverse unless there is a clear abuse of discretion or an error of law which necessarily controlled the grant of the new trial or the outcome of the case. . . .\u2019 \u201d\nOrder affirmed."}
