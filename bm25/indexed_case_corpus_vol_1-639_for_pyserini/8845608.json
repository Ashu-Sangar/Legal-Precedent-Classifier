{"id": "8845608", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nThe appellant states the question involved to be, \u201cShould the value of a retail liquor business and fixtures be accounted for by an administratrix, who, after ineffectual efforts to sell it, continued the business of her deceased husband as her own?\u201d\nThe appellant charged herself with a value of $1,115.15. The orphans\u2019 court adjudged the value inadequate and surcharged the accountant with a difference of $5,384.85. In making this surcharge the court properly said, \u201cThat the value of good will taken in connection with a continuance of a well-established licensed business .... when ascertained, is an asset of a decedent\u2019s estate, even though the original license itself was a mere personal privilege and does not pass to his representatives, is well settled in a line of cases.\u201d These cases are all reviewed in Aschenbach v. Carey, 224 Pa. 303.\nThe decedent\u2019s estate was insolvent, and the appellant took over the business, good will and fixtures; the license was transferred to her, and subsequently to her new husband, who now holds it. Under these circumstances, when the issue was raised, it was for the orphans\u2019 court to decide whether or not the accountant had charged herself with the full value of the good will, business and fixtures. Upon the evidence before him, the learned auditing judge found that she had not, and determined that their real value was $6,500. This is a finding of fact which under our rulings will not be disturbed unless manifest error is apparent. A careful review of the evidence fails to convince us of any such error.\nCounsel for the appellant explains in his printed argument, \u201cIt will be noted that throughout the proceedings in this estate, the term 'license\u2019 is used .... as synonymous with \u2018business\u2019 or \u2018good will.\u2019 It is not contended by either side that the license as such had any value, but only as was said in Buck\u2019s Est., 185 Pa. 57, that 'The opportunity to secure a transfer of the license and a renewal at the end of the year may materially affect the value of the fixtures and good will.\u2019 . . .\u201d\nThe assignments of error are overruled and the decree of the orphans\u2019 court is affirmed."}
