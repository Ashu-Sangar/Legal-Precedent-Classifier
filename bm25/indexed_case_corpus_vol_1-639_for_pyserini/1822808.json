{"id": "1822808", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis case involves the interpretation of the Pennsylvania Recreation Use of Land and Water Act, 68 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 477-1 to 477-8, as pertains to its purpose and applicability. We must determine whether the act provides immunity for all landowners whose land is used for recreational purposes, as it says, or whether its protection is limited to landowners who invite the public to use their land for recreation. We hold that the statute affords protection to owners whose land is used for recreational purposes free of charge, even though the landowner has not donated the land to the public for such purposes.\nThe cause of action arose as follows. In 1984, Robert Friedman, appellant, was hunting on land adjacent to that of Grand Central Sanitation, Inc. Appellant inadvertently wandered onto the land of Grand Central, which was used as a sanitary landfill, though the land was posted with \u201cno trespassing\u201d signs. Appellant allegedly was overcome with fumes from waste material and fell into a large open trench, injuring himself.\nWhen he sued to recover for his injuries, Grand Central defended on several grounds. First, it claimed that in addition to posting its property, it deployed personnel to patrol the property and pursued a policy of prosecuting trespassers. Second, it claimed that appellant was injured in a trench which was so obvious and clearly visible that no one had ever fallen in it before so that appellant was contributorily negligent. Finally, it raised the immunity of the Recreation Use of Land and Water Act, claiming that appellant had entered on its land without charge for recreational purposes, implicating the act, and that Grand Central was therefore not liable for appellant\u2019s injuries, having no duty to keep the premises safe or to give any warning of a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity on its premises.\nThe trial court entered summary judgment for Grand Central after the parties stipulated that a wilful or malicious failure to warn was not at issue, and that Grand Central did not charge a fee to those entering on its property. The court based its decision on 68 P.S. \u00a7 477-3, as interpreted in Gallo v. Yamaha Motor Corp., 363 Pa.Super. 308, 526 A.2d 359 (1987). The statute states:\n\u00a7 477-3. Duty to keep premises safe; warning\nExcept as specifically recognized or provided in section 6 of this act, an owner of land owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for recreational purposes, or to give any warning of a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity on such premises to persons entering for such purposes.\nIn Gallo, supra, the Superior Court rejected the claim that \u201ca landowner must at least indirectly invite the public to recreate on the landowner\u2019s otherwise private property,\u201d holding instead: \u201cBy its terms, Section 3 grants immunity to the \u2018owner of land\u2019 without reference to whether the owner \u2018invites or permits\u2019 others onto his or her property.\u201d Gallo, 363 Pa.Super. at 316, 526 A.2d at 363.\nTo aid in its interpretation, the statute is brief enough to quote in its entirety.\n\u00a7 477-1. Purpose; liability\nThe purpose of this act is to encourage owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes by limiting their liability toward persons entering thereon for such purposes.\n\u00a7 477-2. Definitions\nAs used in this act:\n(1) \u201cLand\u201d means land, roads, water, watercourses, private ways and buildings, structures and machinery or equipment when attached to the realty.\n(2) \u201cOwner\u201d means the possessor of a fee interest, a tenant, lessee, occupant or person in control of the premises.\n(3) \u201cRecreational purpose\u201d includes, but is not limited to, any of the following, or any combination thereof: hunting, fishing, swimming, boating, camping, picnicking, hiking, pleasure driving, nature study, water skiing, water sports and viewing or enjoying historical, archaeological, scenic, or scientific sites.\n(4) \u201cCharge\u201d means the admission price or fee asked in return for invitation or permission to enter or go upon the land.\n\u00a7 477-3. Duty to keep premises safe; warning\nExcept as specifically recognized or provided in section 6 of this act, an owner of land owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for recreational purposes, or to give any warning of a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity on such premises to persons entering for such purposes.\n\u00a7 477-4. Assurance of safe premises; duty of care; responsibility, liability\nExcept as specifically recognized by or provided in section 6 of this act, an owner of land who either directly or indirectly invites or permits without charge any person to use such property for recreational purposes does not thereby:\n(1) Extend any assurance that the premises are safe for any purpose.\n(2) Confer upon such person the legal status of an invitee or licensee to whom a duty of care is owed.\n(3) Assume responsibility for or incur liability for any injury to persons or 'property caused by an act of [sic] omission of such persons.\n\u00a7 477-5. Land leased to State or subdivision Unless otherwise agreed to in writing, the provisions of sections 3 and 4 of this act shall be deemed applicable to the duties and liability of an owner of land leased to the State or any subdivision thereof for recreational purposes.\n\u00a7 477-6. Liability not limited\nNothing in this act limits in any way liability which otherwise exists:\n(1) For wilful or malicious failure to guard or warn against a dangerous condition, use, structure, or activity.\n(2) For injury suffered in any case where the owner of land charges the person or persons who enter or go on the land for the recreational use thereof, except that in the case of land leased to the State or a subdivision thereof, any consideration received by the owner for such lease shall not be deemed a charge within the meaning of this section.\n\u00a7 477-7. Construction of act\nNothing in this act shall be construed to:\n(1) Create a duty of care or ground of liability for injury to persons or property.\n(2) Relieve any person using the land of another for recreational purposes from any obligation which he may have in the absence of this act to exercise care in his use of such land and in his activities thereon, or from the legal consequences of failure to employ such care.\n\u00a7 477-8. Repealer\nThe act of September 27, 1961 (P.L.1696), entitled [section 1629 of Title 12], is repealed.\nAll other acts or parts of acts are repealed in so far as inconsistent herewith.\nThe tension, obviously, arises between the terms of sections one and three. If the purpose of the act, stated in section one, is to encourage owners to make their land available to the public for recreation, why should section three immunize owners whose land is used for recreational purposes without their invitation or permission?\nAppellant argues that any interpretation of section three which grants immunity to appellee is inconsistent with the purpose of the act. He claims that there would be no incentive for a landowner to permit public recreation on his land if a landowner such as appellee, who prohibits entry on his land, is nevertheless granted immunity under the statute.\nThe answer to this argument is given by the Superior Court:\n[T]he Act contains two separate grants of immunity: one in Section 4 and the other in Section 3. By its terms, Section 3 grants immunity to the \u201cowner of land\u201d without reference to whether the owner \u201cinvites or permits\u201d others onto his or her property. Section 4 extends the same immunity to the owner who does somehow invite or permit recreational activity. Unlike Section 3, however, it further provides that those owners who \u201cinvite or permit\u201d recreation do not thereby assure the safety of their premises or confer \u201cthe legal status of an invitee or licensee\u201d upon persons using their premises. The need for this further grant of immunity arises from the complexity of landowner liability in our common law. A landowner traditionally has greater responsibility to persons whom the owner invites or permits onto the land than to mere trespassers. The act makes sense as written only if we view Section 3 as a general grant of immunity and Section 4 as an extension of that immunity to cover the special circumstances long recognized in the case law. If we ignore the plain language of these provisions and hold that the Act as a whole applies only to landowners who \u201cinvite or permit\u201d others to recreate on the land, we will reduce Section 3 to mere surplusage.\nGallo, 363 Pa. at 316, 526 A.2d at 363 (citations omitted).\nIt is understandable that the General Assembly saw fit, in section three, to grant immunity to owners of recreational land even if they did not invite the general public to use their land. The general grant of immunity contained in section three was a replacement for the Act of September 27, 1961, P.L. 1696, which was repealed by the Recreation Use of'Land and Water Act, 68 P.S. \u00a7 477-8. The previous act had provided: \u201cNo landowner of agricultural lands or woodlands shall be liable for the payment of damages for any personal injury suffered by any person while hunting or fishing upon the landowner\u2019s property, except for any deliberate and wilful personal injury inflicted upon such person by such landowner.\u201d The General Assembly enacting the Recreation Use Act, which repealed the broad immunity then existing under P.L. 1696, apparently felt it necessary to replace it with the immunity granted in section three of the Recreation Use Act, even though such immunity was not in direct furtherance of the purpose stated in section one.\nThere is no principle of statutory construction which would permit us to ignore the plain language of section three. As the Superior Court noted in Gallo, supra, if section three is interpreted to apply only to landowners who invite the public to recreate upon their land, the section is a nullity \u2014 mere surplusage to the remainder of the statute. Several principles of statutory construction, codified in Title 1 of Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, prohibit us from rewriting \u201cthe pristine terms of the Recreation Act,\u201d as this Court characterized the language in Commonwealth, Department of Environmental Resources v. Auresto, 511 Pa. 73, 77, 511 A.2d 815, 817 (1986). \u201cWords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a). \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\" 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b) (emphasis added). \u201cEvery statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a).\nMoreover, to interpret section three of the Recreation Use Act as requiring that a landowner invite the public to enter upon his land, in the guise of effectuating the purpose of \u201cencouraging] owners of land to make land and water areas available to the public for recreational purposes,\u201d is to enter a thicket entangled with speculation as to the motives of the landowner in permitting the public to use his land. It would suggest that land which had been open for recreational purposes prior to 1966, when the Recreation Use Act was adopted, would fall outside the terms of the act because immunity could not encourage the owner to make his land available to the public for recreation inasmuch as he had already done so. See, e.g., Livingston by Livingston v. Pennsylvania Power and Light Co., 609 F.Supp. 643 (E.D.Pa.1985); Hahn v. United States, 493 F.Supp. 57 (M.D.Pa.1980). These unnecessary difficulties in applying the statute would exist only if we were to interpret section three as if it required the landowner to invite the public upon his land, just as section four does, thereby equating section three with section four in violation of 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a), supra.\nWe find no authority in any sister state which has squarely addressed the precise question at hand. Several federal courts, however, have applied the statute as written and found no impediment to doing so, even though the immunity in section three seems inconsistent with the stated purpose of the act. A good example is the decision of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, in Barrett v. Pennsylvania Gas & Water Co., 631 F.Supp. 731 (M.D.Pa.1985), applying the Pennsylvania Recreation Use of Land and Water Act. That court stated:\nThe court\u2019s reading of \u00a7\u00a7 477-3 and 477-4 is that an owner of land owes no duty of care to those who use the land for recreational purposes, and further, the landowner does not incur liability to one injured using his land for recreational purposes by virtue of the fact that the person was directly or indirectly invited or permitted onto the land. Thus, the court views \u00a7 477-4 as a further extension of immunity, in other words, a catch-all provision. Were those circumstances in which the owner invited or permitted a person to use his land covered by \u00a7 477-3, there would be no need for \u00a7 477-4. While the purpose of the Act is to encourage landowners to open their land to others, the clear language of the statute provides that an owner of land, regardless of whether he holds open his land to others, owes no duty of care to keep the premises safe for entry or use by others for recreational,purposes. \u00a7 477-3.\nId., 631 F.Supp. at 734. Accord Livingston by Livingston v. Pennsylvania Power and Light Co., supra; Hahn v. United States, supra.\nAccordingly, we hold that the pristine terms of section three of the Recreation Use Act immunize a landowner whose land is used for recreational purposes by the public without charge, whether or not he has invited or permitted the public to enter his land. Therefore, the judgment of the Superior Court, 381 Pa.Super. 662, 548 A.2d 644, must be affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
