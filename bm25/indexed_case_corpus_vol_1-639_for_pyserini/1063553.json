{"id": "1063553", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal involves an attack upon the amount of counsel fees allowed by the court below. In the words of the orphans\u2019 court, the auditing judge was \u201cliberal\u201d; but, again quoting from the court below, we cannot say he was \u201cunduly so,\u201d since there was substantial evidence to support the finding of fact which is here attacked.\nAfter reading the testimony, we are not convinced of reversible error.\nThe decree is affirmed at cost of appellant."}
