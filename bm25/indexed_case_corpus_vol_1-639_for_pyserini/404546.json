{"id": "404546", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nWe granted allowance of appeal in this case to determine whether an arresting officer possesses reasonable and articu-lable grounds to believe that a licensee violated a provision of the Vehicle Code, warranting the stop of the licensee\u2019s car, based upon his observations that the licensee\u2019s vehicle crossed the berm line by six to eight inches on two occasions' for a period of a second or two over a distance of approximately one quarter of a mile. The Superior'Court held that under these circumstances, an arresting officer is justified in stopping the licensee. \u2019\nAs a threshold matter, the Commonwealth argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain Appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal from the Superior Court\u2019s order reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of his pre-trial motion to suppress. For the reasons that follow, we hold that this Court does, in fact, have jurisdiction to entertain discretionary appeals from such orders.\nIn Commonwealth v. Rosario, 538 Pa. 400, 648 A.2d 1172 (1994), a plurality decision of this Court, we addressed the question of whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction to entertain an appeal as of right from an order of the common pleas court reversing the Municipal Court of Philadelphia\u2019s order granting defendant Rosario\u2019s suppression motion. We held that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction under these facts since such an appeal would be interlocutory, and thus, an appeal as of right was unwarranted. We rejected Rosario\u2019s assertion that a footnote found in this Court\u2019s decision in Commonwealth v. Baker, 518 Pa. 145, 541 A.2d 1381 (1988), supported his claim that he was entitled to file an appeal as of right from the order reversing the grant of suppress. In Baker, unlike Rosario, the Superior Court, as here, had reversed an order of the common pleas court granting a suppression motion and discretionary appeal by way of a petition for allowance of appeal was filed with this Court. In discussing whether we lacked jurisdiction to entertain discretionary review, we stated the following:\nWe find no merit in the Commonwealth\u2019s contention that an appeal taken from appellate reversal of a suppression order is interlocutory and that the instant appeal should therefore be quashed. Appeals taken by defendants following appellate reversals of orders suppressing evidence are clearly cognizable by this Court. See Commonwealth v. Hamlin, 503 Pa. 210, 469 A.2d 137 (1983); Commonwealth v. Bosurgi, 411 Pa. 56, 190 A.2d 304 (1963).\nBaker, 541 A.2d at 1382, n. 1.\nIn rejecting Rosario\u2019s contention that this footnote afforded him the avenue to appeal as of right to the Superior Court, Justice Castille, joined by then Justice, now Chief Justice, Flaherty and Justice Papadakos, overruled Baker to the \u201cextent this language ... suggests that appellate reversals of suppression orders are not interlocutory....\u201d He went on to note that\n[w]hile there may be instances in which an appellate court, in exercise of its discretionary powers, may entertain a challenge to the lower court\u2019s reversal of a suppression order if such a claim were properly raised before it in a petition for allowance of appeal, such is not the case here. See e.g. Pa.R.A.P. 1114. Here, a petition for allowance of appeal was not filed.\nRosario, 648 A.2d at 1175.\nLikewise, the concurring opinion authored by Justice Mon-temuro and joined by then Chief Justice Nix, this author and Justice Cappy, distinguished between appeals as of right, as sought by Rosario, and requests for discretionary review, which was the case in Baker. The concurring opinion advocated overruling Baker in a more limited fashion than in the lead opinion, noting that it would do so to the extent that Baker \u201csuggests that appellate reversals of suppression orders are not interlocutory and [are] appealable as a matter of right to the Superior Court in cases such as [Rosario].\u201d Id. at 1176. The concurrence emphasized that it \u201c[did] not believe that Baker should be overruled so as to suggest that all appellate reversals of suppression orders are interlocutory, thus precluding this Court from its longstanding practice of reviewing such orders where special or important reasons are presented.\u201d Id.\nThus, based upon the foregoing, it is clear that a majority of this Court is of the view that we may entertain discretionary review by way of a petition for allowance of appeal in a case where the Superior Court has reversed a lower court order granting suppression. As we conclude that we have jurisdiction to entertain Appellant\u2019s appeal, we now turn to the facts of this case.\nOn July 21, 1998, in the early morning hours, Officer Guy Rosato of the Westtown East Goshen Police Department was on patrol traveling westbound on the West Chester Pike, a/k/a Route 3, in East Goshen Township. The West Chester Pike is a four lane divided highway. Officer Rosato noticed a gray Mazda approximately eight to ten car lengths in front of him. He followed the vehicle and observed it cross the solid fog line on two or three occasions over a distance of approximately one quarter mile. During the period that Officer Rosato was following the vehicle, there were no other vehicles on the roadway. Nevertheless, Officer Rosato decided to investigate as to the reason for this behavior.\nUpon stopping Appellant, Officer Rosato observed signs of intoxication and performed field sobriety tests, which Appellant failed. Appellant was placed under arrest and refused to submit to blood alcohol testing. Officer Rosato then searched Appellant and his vehicle and recovered, among other things, a suspended driver\u2019s license, an uncapped syringe, and a small amount of cocaine. Appellant was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, driving with a suspended license, careless driving, possession of a controlled substance, and possession of drug paraphernalia.\nAppellant subsequently filed a motion to suppress all of the physical evidence seized by Officer Rosato based upon the assertion that the seizure stemmed from an illegal stop of his vehicle. The trial court granted Appellant\u2019s suppression motion concluding that Officer Rosato was not justified in stopping Appellant simply because he observed Appellant swerve onto the berm of the roadway two or three times. The court noted:\nGiven the early morning hour, the fact that there was no other traffic on the roadway and the rather momentary nature of defendant\u2019s vehicle crossing the fog line on two perhaps three occasions, the officer erred in believing he had justification to stop defendant\u2019s vehicle. The observations of Office [sic] Rosato do not warrant a stop on any cognizable legal theory.\nTrial court opinion at 2 n. 1.\nThe Superior Court, 754 A.2d 17, in an unpublished decision with one panel member dissenting, reversed. The court noted that the Commonwealth\u2019s sole argument on appeal was that Officer Rosato possessed a reasonable suspicion to stop Appellant for violating Section 3309(1) of the Vehicle Code. This section provides, in relevant part:\n(1) Driving within single lane. \u2014 A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from the lane until the driver has first ascertained that the movement can be made safely.\nWhile the court conceded that there was no evidence presented at the suppression hearing demonstrating that Petitioner violated this section of the Vehicle Code, the court nevertheless found the stop to be justified based on the following:\nWe cannot agree ... that [Appellant\u2019s] drifting onto the berm of the highway two or three times within such a short distance failed to justify the stop in the within case. Indeed, [Appellant\u2019s] repeated inability to remain on the highway with an intersection approaching reasonably prompted Officer Rosato to \u201ccheck on the operator for his erratic driving[;] [h]is condition, whether he had been drinking or possibly falling asleep.\u201d\nN.T. 1/25/99 at 5-6, 13.\nSlip op. at 4.\nAppellant argues that the Superior Court\u2019s decision conflicts with this Court\u2019s prior decision in Whitmyer, wherein we required that before stopping a vehicle, an officer must be able to articulate specific facts which establish probable cause to believe that the vehicle or its driver was in violation of some provision of the Vehicle Code. Id. at 1116. Appellant argues that in this case the Superior Court applied a less stringent \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d standard in analyzing whether the stop of Appellant\u2019s vehicle was proper rather than the reasonable and articulable grounds standard, i.e., the probable cause standard articulated by this Court in Whitmyer. We agree.\nIn Whitmyer, our Court granted allowance of appeal to determine whether a police officer was legally justified in stopping Whitmyer. There, the arresting officer, Trooper Thomas Kambic, was traveling south on Interstate 81 in Dauphin County when he observed Whitmyer\u2019s vehicle proceeding in the same direction. Whitmyer was behind another vehicle as the two cars approached a point on the Susquehanna River Bridge where two lanes of traffic merged into a single lane. Trooper Kambic then saw Whitmyer drive over the solid white line on the roadway and pass the vehicle in front of him before the vehicle merged into the same lane. There was, however, no evidence that Whitmyer operated his vehicle in a careless or reckless manner while doing so.\nTrooper Kambic continued to follow Whitmyer as he traveled across the bridge into Cumbex-land County. Utilizing his speedometer for two-tenths of a mile, Trooper Kambic estimated Whitmyer\u2019s speed at seventy miles per hour. Shortly thereafter, Trooper Kambic stopped Whitmyer and cited him for driving at an unsafe speed. He also warned Whitmyer about his erratic lane change. The Trooper noticed the smell of burnt marijuana as he approached the vehicle. Whitmyer was ordered out of the vehicle; a search revealed marijuana and rolling papers. Whitmyer was subsequently charged with possession of marijuana and paraphernalia.\nWhitmyer filed a motion to suppress, which the trial court granted. The court held that there was no probable cause to believe that Whitmyer violated the Vehicle Code since he did not fail to yield to an oncoming car when he passed the car in front of him, nor did he pass the vehicle in a posted no passing zone. Furthermore, the court held that the officer\u2019s estimate of Whitmyer\u2019s speed did not constitute probable cause since the officer would have had to time him for three-tenths of a mile pursuant to the Vehicle Code to accurately estimate his speed.\nOn appeal, we affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s decision affirming the trial court. In doing so, we cited to our prior decisions in Commonwealth v. Swanger, 453 Pa. 107, 307 A.2d 875 (1973), and Commonwealth v. Murray, 460 Pa. 53, 331 A.2d 414 (1975). In Swanger, we addressed the question of whether a police officer could stop the driver of an automobile without having observed the driver violate any provision of the Vehicle Code. In concluding that such a stop would not be proper, we first noted that the stopping of a vehicle and the detainment of its passengers constitutes a seizure implicating the Fourth Amendment. We then balanced the need to search and/or seize against the invasion which the search and/or seizure entails. Noting the interests on both sides, we concluded that an individual\u2019s interest in being free from governmental intrusions outweighed the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in ensuring that drivers are in full compliance with the Vehicle Code when operating an automobile, a dangerous instrumentality responsible for numerous deaths each year.\nThus, we held that\nbefore the government may single out one automobile to stop, there must be specific facts justifying this intrusion. To hold otherwise would be to give the police absolute, unreviewable discretion and authority to intrude into an individual\u2019s life for no cause whatsoever.\nSwanger, 307 A.2d at 878.\nIn Murray, this Court reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for theft, holding that the evidence obtained from the search of his vehicle should have been suppressed since police were unable to articulate specific facts \u201cwhich would provide probable cause to believe that the vehicle or the driver was in violation of some provision of the [Vehicle] Code.\u201d Murray, 331 A.2d at 416-17. There, police responded to a burglar alarm that had been activated inside a clothing store. They were unable to apprehend or identify a fleeing suspect. Approximately one hour later, they observed a vehicle pull into a driveway of a house near the store and then depart. Police followed the car, which at no time violated any traffic laws. Police signaled the car to stop and when they approached, they observed a hammer and railroad spike. A further search of the vehicle, conducted pursuant to a warrant, disclosed evidence from the break-in.\nThe Commonwealth, in Whitmyer, attempted to distinguish our decisions in Sivanger and Mmray since those cases were decided prior to the enactment of Section 6308(b) of the Vehicle Code. This Section provides that\n[w]henever a police officer .. . has articulable and reasonable grounds to suspect a violation of this title, he may stop a vehicle, upon request or signal, for the purpose of checking the vehicle\u2019s registration, proof of financial responsibility, vehicle identification number or engine number or driver\u2019s license, or to secure such other information as the officer may reasonably believe to be necessary to enforce the provisions of this title.\nThe Commonwealth posited that our decisions in Swanger and Murt\"ay were needed in order to curb an officer\u2019s virtually unlimited authority under the prior version of the Code, but that \u00a7 6308(b) provided limitations by way of statute.\nWe rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that, given this background, the lower courts improperly applied a heightened \u201cprobable cause\u201d standard to the facts in Whitmyer since Section 6308(b) of the Vehicle Code only requires that an officer have \u201carticulable and reasonable grounds to suspect a violation\u201d in order to stop a vehicle. We noted the following:\nAccording to the Commonwealth, both the trial court and the Superior Court have disregarded the above provision [Section 6308(b) ] in favor of a heightened probable cause standard in assessing the legal justification of the stop of Appellee. We disagree and find that the law has been correctly applied in this case.\nThe crux of the Commonwealth\u2019s argument centers on the semantic difference between the standard articulated in Murray-probable cause to believe that there has been a violation of the Vehicle Code, and the language of the statute \u2014 articulable and reasonable grounds to suspect a violation of the Vehicle Code. However, when we balance the underlying interests of the individual and the government, the two standards amount to nothing more than a distinction without a difference.\nThe Commonwealth has an interest in enacting and enforcing rules and regulations for the safety of those who travel its highways and roads. The police should thus be permitted a sufficient degree of latitude to stop automobiles in order to meet this objective. On the other side, the privacy interest of the individual has been cogently articulated by the United States Supreme Court:\nAn individual operating or traveling in an automobile does not lose all reasonable expectation of privacy simply because the automobile and its use are subject to govem-mental regulation. Automobile travel is a basic, pervasive, and often necessary mode of transportation to and from one\u2019s home, workplace, and leisure activities. Many people spend more hours each day traveling in cars than walking on the streets. Undoubtedly, many find a greater sense of security and privacy in traveling in an automobile than they do in exposing themselves by pedestrian or other modes of travel.\nDelaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 662[, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660] (1979) (footnote omitted).\nWhen previously faced with these two competing interests, we held \u201cthat a stop of a single vehicle is unreasonable where there is no outward sign the vehicle or the operator are in violation of the Vehicle Code____ Before the government may single out one automobile to stop, there must be specific facts justifying this intrusion.\u201d Commonwealth v. Swanger, [453 Pa. 107,] 307 A.2d at 878. Thus, the presence of similar facts in this case should dictate a similar result. The legislature has vested police officers with the authority to stop vehicles whenever they have \u201carticulable and reasonable grounds to suspect a violation\u201d of the Vehicle Code. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308(b). Applying that standard to the instant case, it is apparent that the trial court and Superior Court were correct when they concluded that Trooper Kambic had no justifiable basis for stopping Appellee.\nWhitmyer, 668 A.2d at 1116-17 (emphasis added).\nGiven the foregoing, we conclude that the Superior Court erred in holding that Officer Rosato was justified in stopping Appellant\u2019s vehicle under the facts of this case. As noted previously, the court conceded that \u201cthe lack of any evidence at the suppression hearing that Appellant\u2019s driving created a safety hazard leads us to agree with the trial court that there was insufficient evidence to support a Section 3309(1) violation.\u201d Slip op. at 4. In finding the stop of Appellant to be justified nevertheless, the court lowered the standard necessary for a proper vehicle stop as articulated by this Court in Whitmyer.\nIf the alleged basis of a vehicular stop is to permit a determination whether there has been compliance with the Motor Vehicle Code of this Commonwealth, it is encumbent [sic] upon the officer to articulate specific facts possessed by him, at the time of the questioned stop, which would provide probable cause to believe that the vehicle or the driver was in violation of some provision of the Code.\nWhitmyer, 668 A.2d at 1116, citing Swanger, 307 A.2d at 879 (emphasis added).\nAccordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order granting Appellant\u2019s suppression motion.\nJustice NEWMAN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nJustice CASTILLE files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR dissents.\n. The dissent does not believe that this case presents special or important reasons warranting a grant of allowance of appeal noting that \"this case involves the supremely fact-bound question of the lawfulness of a particular traffic stop, which led to drug- and DUI-related charges.\u201d Dissenting Opinion at 6. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s view, however, the issue is not one focused entirely on the factual scenario of the underlying matter, but instead was granted in order for this Court to determine whether the Superior Court had lowered the standard for determining what constitutes \"articulable and reasonable grounds to suspect a violation\u201d of the Vehicle Code for purposes of Section 6308(b). Specifically, our inquiry focuses upon whether the Superior Court has issued a decision in contravention of our prior decision in Commonwealth v. Whitmyer, 542 Pa. 545, 668 A.2d 1113 (1995), by lowering the probable cause standard required therein. This is the issue for which we concluded special and important reasons existed warranting a grant of allowance of appeal. There are at least two other cases pending resolution of this matter before the Court. See Commonwealth v. Cosnek, 582 WAL 2000, and Commonwealth v. Baumgardner, 138 MAL 2001.\nUltimately, it is concluded herein that the Superior Court did lower the standard previously articulated by this Court in Whitmyer; it is noted that the dissent apparently agrees with such determination.\n. Officer Rosato testified on direct examination that he observed the vehicle cross the log line two to three times; on cross examination, Officer Rosato stated that he saw the vehicle cross a minimum of two times, but that he could not recall whether it crossed the fog line a third time.\n. The Commonwealth now attempts to assert that Officer Rosato had reasonable suspicion to stop Appellant for violating Section 3301 (driving on right side of roadway) of the Vehicle Code; however, since the Commonwealth\u2019s sole basis on appeal to Superior Court was its assertion that Officer Rosato had reasonable suspicion to stop Appellant for violating Section 3309(1), we need not address this contention.\n. Under the previously enacted 75 P.S. \u00a7 1221(b), police had the right to stop any vehicle upon request for the purpose of checking for proof of registration, insurance, etc."}
