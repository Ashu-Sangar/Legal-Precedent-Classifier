{"id": "1095137", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County confirmed an order of the register of wills admitting to probate the will of Alice Cecelia Flaherty, deceased. Appellant contends that decedent\u2019s domicile, at the time of her death, was in West Chester County, New York, and not in Philadelphia; but both the judge who presided at the hearing and the court below in bane decided, that the evidence would not warrant the granting of an issue on the question of domicile, since, on the proofs adduced, \u201ca verdict in favor of a New York domicile could not be sustained.\u201d We see no error and\nThe decree appealed from is affirmed at cost of appellant."}
