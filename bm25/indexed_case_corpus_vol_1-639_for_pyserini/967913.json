{"id": "967913", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIf the instrument in question was testamentary it was of course revocable, and was revoked by the subsequent conveyance.\nIf, however, it was a deed, then the alleged trust created an estate in fee simple or at least in fee tail, which was executed by the statute, in the five heirs of Sarah E. Dinsmore, and the plaintiff, holding a conveyance from all the said heirs, has the entire title.\nIn either view the judgment must be affirmed."}
