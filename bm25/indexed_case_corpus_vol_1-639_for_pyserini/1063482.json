Public Service Commission, 268 Pa. 192, and by our Superior Court, in Borough of Wilkinsburg v. Public Service Commission, 72 Pa. Superior Ct. 423. Counsel for plaintiff borough frankly state that the purpose of the instant appeal is \u201cto induce a reconsideration of all the questions involved, and failing this [should we adhere to our former conclusions], then to carry the case into the Supreme Court of the United States, so that it may be heard in connection with [another] writ of error there pending,\u201d and, as we understand the situation, involving questions closely connected with those at bar.\nWe see no reason to depart from the rulings made and views expressed in the Scranton case.\nThe judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed."}
