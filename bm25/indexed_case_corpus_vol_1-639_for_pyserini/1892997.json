{"id": "1892997", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nBoth parties to a contest in the Orphans\u2019 Court have appealed from its final Decree which dismissed their respective exceptions to an adjudication. The Orphans\u2019 Court decreed (1) that ten entireties accounts should be divided equally between decedent\u2019s wife and decedent\u2019s executor, and (2) that decedent\u2019s wife was entitled solely and absolutely to an alleged tentative trust savings account.\nFrom the facts, most of which were stipulated and others appear in the record, we make the following summary.\nNicholas Brose, a physician, died testate July 10, 1963, in Allegheny County. On June 27, 1944, he had married a nurse an anaesthetist named Irma E. Brose. During their married life together and until May 7, 1963, both continued to practice their respective professions. Money derived from their joint earnings was deposited in ten savings accounts and in one checking account in eight different banks and in one savings and loan association.\n\u201cEntireties\u201d Accounts\nThe parties stipulated that 10 of the aforesaid 11 accounts were \u201centireties\u201d accounts and totaled $131, 621.10. More accurately, each account was evidenced by an executed contract of deposit. Some of the contracts are well drawn and are entitled \u201cNicholas or Irma,\u201d or \u201cNicholas and Irma,\u201d thus clearly creating a tenancy by the entireties. On the other hand, some of the contracts are inartistically drawn and do not accurately reflect the husband-wife relationship. Some of these list the names of \u201cNicholas\u201d and \u201cIrma\u201d but do not connect them either with a conjunction or a disjunction ; others denominate the relationship as a \u201cjoint tenancy\u201d; and yet another merely says, \u201cPayable to either or to the survivor.\u201d\nMoreover, most of the contracts recite, \u201cAll deposits made therein shall be owned by us as tenants by the entireties with the right of survivorship. . . .\u201d Several others were opened as \u201cA joint account of husband and wife,\u201d and were made \u201cpayable to either of us or the survivor.\u201d\nDespite these actual and technical differences, each of the bank accounts and each of the ten contracts above mentioned clearly created (as we shall see) a tenancy by the entireties.\nWhat followed the opening of the aforesaid accounts was very unusual. On May 7, 1963, Irma left the common domicile (concealing her whereabouts from Nicholas) and withdrew $33,000 from their $38,-387.05 checking account at the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company. This was withdrawn without Nicholas\u2019s knowledge or consent. When Nicholas discovered this, he withdrew, without Irma\u2019s knowledge or consent, the entire balance in three other accounts, and almost all of the balance of the checking account in the Mellon Bank. Irma then withdrew 75 percent of one \u201centireties\u201d account, all of two more \u201centire-ties\u201d accounts, as well as the entire balance of another, account held by \u201cIrma in trust for Nicholas.\u201d\nEach withdrawal was appropriated to the with-drawer\u2019s exclusive use; after Irma\u2019s first withdrawal, each was made with the knowledge by the other spouse of preceding withdrawals but without the consent of the other spouse. Subsequent to Nicholas\u2019s death, Irma withdrew all of the remaining balances in the entireties accounts, except the balance in a savings account in the Mellon Bank which had been claimed by the executor and was therefore withheld by that bank pending. Judicial determination.\nA deposit in a banking account or in a checking account or in a.savings account, which is opened or registered in the name of a husband and wife, or of a husband or wife, or of two persons who are husband and wife although not so denominated, creates a tenancy by the entireties, irrespective of whether the money deposited is payable to husband and wife or to husband or wife, or is denominated a joint account or a joint tenancy. Stemniski v. Stemniski, 403 Pa. 38, 41, 169 A. 2d 51; Alcorn v. Alcorn, 364 Pa. 375, 378-379, 72 A. 2d 96; Madden v. Gosztonyi Savings and Trust Co., 331 Pa. 476, 200 A. 624; Wilbur Trust Co. v. Knadler, 322 Pa. 17, 21, 185 A. 319; Berhalter v. Berhalter, 315 Pa. 225, 227, 173 A. 172. Cf. also, Pregrad v. Pregrad, 367 Pa. 177, 179, 80 A. 2d 58.\nMoreover, the law is well settled that an estate by the entireties cannot be terminated at the option of one of the co-tenants but can always be terminated or destroyed by mutual agreement: Reifschneider v. Reifschneider, 413 Pa. 342, 344, 196 A. 2d 324; Stemniski v. Stemniski, 403 Pa., supra; Interboro Bank and Trust Co. Appeal, 359 Pa. 315, 318, 59 A. 2d 101.\nWithdrawing by one tenant and appropriating the money or property to the with drawers own exclusive use without the consent or subsequent approval of the other tenant, terminates the tenancy at the option of the co-tenant, but not the co-tenant\u2019s right to an accounting and to one-half thereof.\nIn Berhalter v. Berhalter, 315 Pa., supra, the Court aptly said (pages 227-228) : \u201c. . . Even though there had been no such agreement [expressly creating an estate by the entireties], a deposit of money in the names of husband and wife, or, of husband or wife, using both names, creates an estate by entireties: Sloan\u2019s Est., 254 Pa. 346; Blick v. Cockins, 252 Pa. 56; Klenke\u2019s Est., No. 1, 210 Pa. 572 . . . with the right of survivorship. At common law, the heirs of the survivor take to the exclusion of the heirs of the first deceased. The theory of joint estates of this character is that each of the tenants holds the entire estate by the half and by the whole. On the death of one, the other does not acquire a new interest by descent. The interest of the surviving tenant in the whole is not increased by the extinguishment of the interest of the other by death, but rather is freed of the restraints imposed upon it by the presence of an interest of like degree and kind which existed while both lived: Cf. Haggerty\u2019s Est., 311 Pa. 503. The whole estate continues in the survivor as it would continue in a corporation after the death of one of the corpora-tors. One of the parties cannot destroy the incidents of the entirety by any act of his or hers: Beihl v. Martin, 236 Pa. 519. It is the contention of appellant that when the parties expressed in the agreement that \u2018either of them\u2019 could withdraw all or any part of the fund, one of the elements essential to an estate by entirety was lacking, . . . The fund withdrawn is still subject to the legal status of the estate, and it has stamped on it in the hands of the one who withdrew it all the elements of a trust. Where both husband and wife have the power to withdraw funds deposited in a joint account, the power must be exercised in good faith for the mutual benefit of both, and cannot be rightly exercised by the fraudulent withdrawal of the corpus of the funds for the exclusive use of one for the purpose of depriving the other of any use thereof or title thereto. We have held that the fact an agreement creating an estate by entirety contains the right to withdraw by either husband or wife, does not destroy the legal effect of the estate. \u2018It is a joint deposit with right of survivorship where the certificates are payable to husband or wife, as well as where payable to husband and wife. In either case it is held by entireties\u2019: Sloan\u2019s Est., Blick v. Cockins, Klenke\u2019s Est., all supra.\u201d\nIn Stemniski v. Stemniski, 403 Pa., supra, the Court, quoting from Berhalter v. Berhalter, 315 Pa. 225, 173 A. 172, said (page 42) : \u201c \u2018When the wife attempted to withdraw more than one-half of this fund [deposited in a joint account], or any of it, from the bank and use it for her individual purposes, she violated the terms of the entirety agreement.\u2019 \u201d\n\u201cFurthermore, all property of the parties held by the entireties is affected, not merely the unit that has been improperly drawn upon. In Watkins there were four bank accounts, and the [lower] Court, we affirming, ordered all four divided, although funds from only two had been diverted by the defendant husband. The Court said: \u2018Therefore, it would be inconsistent with the policy of the Berhalter case to require plaintiff to wait until funds also are diverted from the two hitherto unwithdrawn accounts before suing to protect her interest in them.\u2019 \u201d\nWhile the prior decisions of this Court do not establish exactly what acts or actions are necessary to evidence a mutual agreement to terminate an estate by the entireties, it is clear that the actions of Irma and Nicholas evidenced a mutual intent to terminate not only the accounts from which each withdrew and appropriated the money therein to her or his own exclusive use, but likewise all of the entireties accounts : Stemniski v. Stemniski, 403 Pa., supra; Watkins v. Watkins, 393 Pa. 284, 286-287, 142 A. 2d 6. Cf. also, Alcorn v. Alcorn, 364 Pa., supra.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court therefore properly concluded and decreed (1) that each spouse was entitled to one-half of all the amounts on deposit in the entireties accounts on May 7, 1963; (2) that the amount on deposit in the savings account in the Mellon National Bank and Trust Company totaling $11,627.99 (against which the equivalent of a stop order had been entered) should be paid to Nicholas\u2019s executor, and (3) that Irma must pay to Nicholas\u2019s executor the sum of $14,-627.99, the amount by which her withdrawals exceeded her one-half share of the $131,621.10 which was on deposit in the aforesaid entireties accounts on May 7, 1963.\nThe \u201cIn Trust\u201d Account\nAn account was opened in the Dollar Savings Bank on November 28, 1960, in the name of Irma in trust for Nicholas. The facts relative to this account are meager. The auditing Judge made no findings or conclusion with reference to this account in his adjudication. However, he subsequently filed an amended decree in which, without finding or reciting any facts, he ordered and decreed that this trust account \u201cwas the sole and separate property of Irma E. Brose and she is not required to account for the funds withdrawn by her from this account nor to divide them with [Nicholas\u2019s] executor.\u201d Subsequently, the auditing Judge filed a supplemental opinion in which he said, \u201cThe record also indicates that there was a savings account in the Dollar Savings Bank at the date of Nicholas A. Brose\u2019s death in the name of Irma E. Brose in trust for Nicholas A. Brose, in the amount of $11,226.98. These are funds that clearly belong to Irma E. Brose as the settlor of the said tentative trust, the beneficiary having predeceased her.\u201d This conclusion was reached by assuming that this was a tentative trust.\nIf this trust account had been opened with Irma\u2019s money \u2014 an absolutely essential requisite for a Totten tentative trust \u2014 the Orphans\u2019 Court was correct in concluding that it was a tentative and hence a revocable trust, and upon the death of either, belonged to the survivor. However, the parties agreed that the funds contained in this trust account in the Dollar Savings Bank \u201cwere [derived] from the joint earnings of the respective parties.\u201d The question arises: Was this evidence sufficient to create a tentative Totten trust which, under the authorities, is presumed to be a revocable trust?\nWhere property of any kind (with exceptions hereinafter discussed) is placed in the name of the donor or settlor in trust for a named beneficiary, unless a power of revocation is expressly or impliedly reserved, the general principle of law is well settled that such facts create a trust which is prima facie irrevocable. Ingels Estate, 372 Pa. 171, 92 A. 2d 881; Fishblate v. Fishblate, 238 Pa. 450, 457, 86 A. 469; Rambo v. Pile, 220 Pa. 235, 69 A. 807; Merigan v. McGonigle, 205 Pa. 321, 54 A. 994; Gaffney\u2019s Estate, 146 Pa. 49, 23 A. 163; Scott on Trusts, 2d Ed., Vol. III, Sec. 329A, page 2391, Sec. 330, page 2393. Moreover, the authorities are in accord that the actual intention of the donor or settlor is so uncertain, that it may be shown by parol evidence. Furjanick Estate, 375 Pa. 484, 100 A. 2d 85; Ingles Estate, 372 Pa., supra; Rodgers Esstate, 374 Pa. 246, 97 A. 2d 789; Scanlon\u2019s Estate, 313 Pa. 424, 169 A. 106.\nHowever, an exception to the general principle was engrafted onto and was incorporated in the law of Pennsylvania with respect to a deposit in a savings account by one person of Ms own money in his own name as trustee for another. Scanlon\u2019s Estate, 313 Pa., supra, which adopted the New York rule laid down in Matter of Totten, 179 N.Y. 112, is the leading case. The law is well summarized in the syllabus in Rodgers Estate, 374 Pa., supra, which reads :\n\u201c1. A [savings] bank deposit by one person of Ms own money, in his own name, as trustee for another, standing alone, creates merely a tentative trust, revocable at will, until the depositor dies or completes the gift in his lifetime.\n\u201c2. A tentative trust may be revoked, among other means, by (1) oral declarations of the depositor, and (2) facts and circumstances resulting in inadequacy of the estate assets to satisfy the testamentary gifts, funeral and administration expenses, taxes and other charges.\n\u201c3. Restatement, Trusts, \u00a758, cited.\n\u201c4. It was Held that the testimony of the scrivener of decedent\u2019s will as to his conversations with the testatrix leading to the preparation of her will was admissible to show her intention that the tentative trust be revoked.\n\u201c5. It was Held that the circumstantial evidence was insufficient to establish that settlor intended to make the tentative trust irrevocable.\u201d\nHowever, the tentative trust doctrine has never been extended to any property other than a savings account (or savings share account in a building and loan association) where the donor with his own money opened such an account in his own name in trust for the donee: Ingels Estate, 372 Pa., supra, page 177, and the many cases therein cited; Chadrow v. Kellman, 378 Pa., supra, page 244; Vierling v. Ellwood City Fed. S. & L. Ass\u2019n, 356 Pa., supra, page 354.\nIn Ingels Estate, 372 Pa., supra, the Court said (pp. 176-177) : \u201cThe presumption that a revocable trust is intended by such a deposit is an exception to the general rule that trusts are irrevocable unless ai power of revocation is expressly [or impliedly] reserved: Scott on Trusts (1939), secs. 329A, 330.2; Kraft v. Neuffer, 202 Pa. 558, 561, 52 A. 100; Fishblate v. Fishblate, 238 Pa. 450, 458, 86 A. 469. . . . Because the exception depends on the peculiar circumstances of this type of transaction, we have never extended the doctrine of tentative trusts to any property other than a savings account. See: Tunnell\u2019s Estate, 325 Pa. 554, 560, 190 A. 906; Brown v. Monaca Federal Savings and Loan Association, 352 Pa. 1, 42 A. 2d 50; Scott on Trusts (1939) sec. 58.3: \u2018It is clear that a similar trust of property other than savings hank deposits would be invalid.\u2019 \u201d\nIf such a tentative trust account was created by Irma, Nicholas\u2019s executor would have to produce clear and convincing evidence that Irma intended to make the tentative trust irrevocable. Ingels Estate, 372 Pa., supra.\nHowever, on the present record it would appear that Irma\u2019s trust for Nicholas was not a tentative or revocable trust since it was created from the joint earnings of Irma and Nicholas and not with Irma\u2019s own money. If this is correct, it could not be a tentative trust, as the Orphans\u2019 Court erroneously assumed it to be. Since parol evidence is admissible to prove the intention of the parties with respect to this account and whether a revocable or irrevocable trust was intended to be created, it is only fair and equitable to remand the record to the Orphans\u2019 Court for a further hearing and subsequent determination of this issue in the light of this Opinion.\nDecree as modified affirmed, record remanded with directions, each party to pay own costs.\nhereinafter referred to as \u201cNicholas.\u201d\nhereinafter referred to as \u201cIrma.\u201d\nThe figures submitted by the parties were slightly changed by the Court.\nIrma had instituted divorce proceedings the day before Nicholas\u2019s death.\nAfter learning of Irma\u2019s first withdrawal from the checking account, Nicholas had amended this savings account deposit' contract to read: \u201cTwo Signatures Required.\u201d\nor real estate which is recorded, or a bond or stock certificate which is registered in the name of two persons who are husband and wife.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nItalics in this instance are in the Stemniski Opinion.\nlimited first to a savings account, and subsequently also to a share in a savings and loan association.

The writer of this Opinion still cannot see any reason or justification for this exception, but it is the law of Pennsylvania. See my Dissenting Oxmiion in Ingels Estate, 372 Pa., supra, page 182."}
