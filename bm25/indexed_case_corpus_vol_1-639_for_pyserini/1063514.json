{"id": "1063514", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nOn April 27, 1916, it was agreed between defendant coal company and plaintiff dealer, that the former would furnish the latter his \u201centire requirements\u201d of coal, \u201cfrom date to April 1st, 1917,\u201d other terms of sale, with which we are not now concerned, being set forth in the written contract. Plaintiff, alleging that defendant had refused to perform, brought an action for damages; the court below entered a nonsuit, which it declined to remove, and this appeal followed.\nIn support of the judgment appealed from, defendant contends that the contract in suit is too indefinite to be enforced \u2014 plaintiff\u2019s \u201crequirements\u201d being neither fixed nor capable of establishment by any standard \u2014 and that it lacks mutuality; but, without passing upon these grounds (which, if correct, would be sufficient in themselves to sustain the nonsuit), and assuming, for present purposes, that the contract is valid and enforcible, plaintiff\u2019s own testimony shows that he, himself, breached its obligations, during the summer months of 1916, by buying all of his coal requirements from companies other than defendant.\nPlaintiff offered no evidence of waiver, nor did he show that defendant had any knowledge of these purchases from others. The breach of contract was fatal to plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery, and, on this ground, the nonsuit was properly entered; therefore, it is unnecessary to discuss the other reasons given by the court below in support of its action.\nThe assignments of error are overruled and the judgment is affirmed."}
