{"id": "848199", "contents": "Per. Curiam,\nAn examination of this somewhat confused record has satisfied us that there was no error in allowing the appeals of J. Charles Bedell and others. They were in time, and it would have been error to have refused them. There is nothing in either of the specifications of error that would warrant a reversal of the order complained of.\nOrder affirmed, with costs to be paid by appellant."}
