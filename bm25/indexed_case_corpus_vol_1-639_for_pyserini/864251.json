{"id": "864251", "contents": "Pee Cuetam,\nAs was said in Campbell v. Baker, 46 Pa. 243, \u201c When a guaranty is general, that is, without having any of its terms fixed in the writing, the law adds the usual conditions that there shall be due and unsuccessful diligence used by the creditor to collect the claim from the principal, unless it appears that all diligence would be hopeless. But the law adds or implies no such conditions where the parties themselves fixed the terms of the contract.\u201d In this case, the defendant by his contract und\u00e9r seal, indorsed on the judgment note, guarantees \u201c the payment of the within judgment note and all moneys due and to become due thereon if the same cannot be recovered out of the property purchased of Robert Service\u2019s estate by said Howell McNair by deed this day delivered.\u201d This is a special, not a general guaranty. By forthwith entering judgment on the note and thus acquiring a lien on the real estate mentioned in the guarantee, and then keeping that lien continuously alive, the plaintiff did all that, in good faith, she was bound to do under the terms of the special contract. In view of the terms of the guaranty we think the instructions recited in the assignment of error are substantially correct, and the judgment should not be disturbed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
