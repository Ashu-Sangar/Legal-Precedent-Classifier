{"id": "866871", "contents": "Pee Ctjeiam,\nThe testimony referred to by the learned judge in that part of his charge recited in the first specification, was to the effect that in an interview with Mrs. Shoemaker, after her husband\u2019s death and before letters of administration were granted to defendants, the plaintiffs\u2019 intestate, Thomas Beck, admitted that payments on account of the note in question had been made by Mr. Shoemaker in his lifetime; that he, Mr. Beck, agreed to apply, as credits on the notes, certain sums for which lie was liable on account of bills, relating to the farm owned by him and Mr. Shoemaker as tenants in common, some of which bills had been paid by Mr. Shoemaker, and others by Mrs. Shoemaker after his decease; that after allowing these credits for his eontributive share of the farm bills thus paid by Mr. and Mrs. Shoemaker, plaintiffs\u2019 intestate claimed there was still due on the note a small balance of sixty-seven cents, which was then and there paid by Mrs. Shoemaker and accepted by him in full settlement and discharge of the note. The defendants\u2019 sole contention was that by allowance of said credits, some of which were for payments made by Mrs. Shoemaker after her husband\u2019s death, and by payment of the small balance claimed, the note was fully settled and paid; and, in support of that position, they relied on the testimony referred to. It presented a question of fact which was for the exclusive consideration of the jury, and they doubtless understood it correctly. There was no allegation, nor was there any attempt to prove payment and acceptance, from the maker of the note or his administrator, of any smaller sum than the amount actually due, in satisfaction of the note. Referring to the testimony as to what took place at the interview between Mrs. Shoemaker and defendants\u2019 intestate, the learned judge rightly said to the jury: \u201cIf this testimony is true, then this note was then and there settled and plaintiffs would not be entitled to recover in this action. If you do not believe this to be true, and you believe there was no such conversation \u2014 no such settlement, or that the note then and there referred to was not this note, but some other note, and that the settlement then and there made was not the settlement of this indebtedness, but a settlement of some other matter, then your verdict will be for the plaintiffs for whatever you find due on the note.\u201d This was substantially the only question submitted to the jury. There was no other question in the case. In view therefore of the testimony on which defendants relied, the charge cannot be regarded as misleading. In saying, by way of illustration, what is complained of in the second specification, the learned judge doubtless had in mind the facts of the case, as indicated by the defendants\u2019 testimony, and meant a settlement, not with the maker of a note, but with a third party \u2014 such a settlement as that shown to have taken place between plaintiffs\u2019 intestate and Mrs. Shoemaker after her husband\u2019s death. There is nothing else in the ease to which the language complained of could possibly apply.\nConsidered as a whole, there is no substantial error in the charge.\nJudgment affirmed."}
