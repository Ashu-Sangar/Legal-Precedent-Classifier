{"id": "1263095", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Arnold,\nThis was a complaint in equity seeking to enjoin the City of Williamsport from enforcing its ordinance levying a tax on the privilege and transaction of engaging in the operation of mechanical or electronic phonographs (juke boxes) played by persons who inserted coins into the machines. Plaintiff appeals from the decree of the court below dismissing the complaint.\nThe pertinent provision of the city\u2019s ordinance reads as follows: \u201cSection 2: (a) \u2018Admission\u2019 shall mean monetary charge of any character whatever, charged or paid for the privilege of engaging in amusements as hereinafter .defined, (b) \u2018Amusement\u2019 shall mean all manner and form of entertainment within the City of Williamsport, Pa., including among others, the following: juke boxes, pinball machines, and any other form Of mechanical and/or electronic device for which, admission is charged or paid.\u201d\nThe'authority for the ordinance is the so-called \u201ctax anything\u201d Act of 1947, P. L. 1145, as amended, 53 PS \u00a72015.1. The \u201ctax anything\u201d Act is similar to the Sterling Act and a similar ordinance of Philadelphia was sustained in Phonograph Operators Association v. City of Philadelphia, 54 D. & C. 83.\nObviously and literally, the word \u201camusement,\u201d includes juke boxes or any other form of mechanical or electronic device for which admission is charged or paid. Admittedly the ordinance, section 2 (a), provides that admission shall mean a monetary charge of any character whatsoever charged for engaging in the amusement as defined. The ordinance clearly contemplates taxation of these juke boxes. The tax was not upon a \u201cplace of amusement\u201d but upon the privilege of engaging in amusement as defined in section 2 (b) of the ordinance. The ordinance in its title gave notice of defined meanings thereafter set forth and is unimpeachable.\nDecree affirmed; appellant to pay the costs."}
