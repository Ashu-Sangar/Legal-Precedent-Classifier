{"id": "4197542", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nThe Harrisburg City Council, seeking control of the Harrisburg Authority, enacted Bill Number 36 of 2006, an ordinance giving it sole power to appoint members to the Harrisburg Authority\u2019s Board. Previously, Harrisburg\u2019s mayor, with City Council\u2019s advice and consent, appointed Board members to the Authority. Appellee Reed, then-mayor of Harrisburg, vetoed the ordinance. Council overrode the veto, and on the same day purported to appoint three people to the five-member Authority Board.\nAppellees sued, seeking immediate injunctive, declaratory, and quo warranto relief. Extensive, circuitous litigation regarding the preliminary injunction ensued. See Reed v. Harrisburg City Council, 927 A.2d 698, 706 (Pa.Cmwlth.2007) (en banc) (appellees not entitled to injunction because they failed to show likelihood of irreparable harm). Meanwhile, the trial court held argument regarding the declaratory judgment and quo warranto actions. The trial court distinguished this case from City Council of City of Hazleton v. City of Hazleton, 134 Pa.Cmwlth. 174, 578 A.2d 580 (1990), affirmed, by an equally divided court, 528 Pa. 604, 600 A.2d 191 (1992), which held the Hazleton City Council had the authority to appoint municipal authority boardmembers. The trial court noted Hazleton has an optional Plan B form of government, while Harrisburg\u2019s mayor-council Plan A form of government gives the mayor substantially more power. Interpreting the Optional Third Class City Charter Law, 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 41101-45000, the trial court found the term governing personnel to include both the mayor and the city council. Trial Court Opinion, 1/10/08, at 8-9 (quoting 53 P.S. \u00a7 41402). The trial court concluded Harrisburg\u2019s pre-ordinance method of appointment was the appropriate method under the Municipal Authorities Act (MAA), 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5601-23; it declared the ordinance void, and separately held Council\u2019s appointees to the Board \u201care without warrant to hold membership on the [B]oard of the Harrisburg Authority.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 1/10/08, at 12.\nAppellants appealed to the Commonwealth Court. Appellees objected on jurisdictional grounds and moved to transfer the matter to this Court. In a single-judge order, the Commonwealth Court transferred the case to this Court, noting 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 722(2) grants this Court exclusive appellate jurisdiction over final orders involving the right to public office. However, before reaching this case\u2019s underlying merits, we must determine if appellees have standing to bring this quo warranto action. \u201cAs this is a purely legal question, our standard of review is de novo and scope of review is plenary.\u201d In re Milton Hershey School, 590 Pa. 35, 911 A.2d 1258, 1261 (2006).\nThe parties do not dispute that municipal authority boardmembers are subject to quo warranto actions. Generally, a quo warranto action is the exclusive means of challenging the title or right to public office, and only the Attorney General or local district attorney may institute a quo warranto action. In re One Hundred or More Qualified Electors of the Municipality of Clairton, 546 Pa. 126, 688 A.2d 283, 286 (1996).\n[A] private person, with no special right or interest in the public office, must first seek to have either the Attorney General or local district attorney file a quo wan-anto action. It is only after both the Attorney General and the local district attorney decline to bring such an action that a private person will have standing to seek the removal of the holder of a public office....\nId., at 287 n. 10 (emphasis in original). \u201cA party will be permitted to bring an alternative action to the remedy of quo warranto where the Attorney General and the local district attorney refuse to bring such an action or if it would be a futile exercise to seek the approval of these officials.\u201d Id., at 286-87.\nAppellants contend appellees lack standing to bring a quo warranto action because they filed this action without first asking both the Attorney General and the local district attorney to bring the action. Appellants rely upon recent Commonwealth Court holdings, which state \u201c \u2018[i]t is when both agencies decline that a private person may have standing but only if he or she has a special interest, or if he or she has been specially damaged as distinguished from a right or interest of the public in general.\u2019 \u201d Fraternal Order of Police, Queen City Lodge No. 10 v. City of Allentown, 894 A.2d 224, 227 (Pa. Cmwlth.2006) (emphasis in original) (quoting Bolus v. Murphy, 823 A.2d 1075,1079 (Pa.Cmwlth.2003)).\nAppellees argue, as then-mayor of Harrisburg and as the mayor\u2019s appointee to the Authority\u2019s Board, they are public officials and \u201cmay pursue actions in quo warranto without first consulting either the attorney general or the district attorney.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Brief, at 23. Appellees claim Mayor Reed had an interest in protecting his purported power to appoint Board members to the Authority. Appellee Clark, a Board member who lost his position to a Council-appointed purported member, also claims an interest in protecting Mayor Reed\u2019s appointment power.\nAppellants claim appellees should have notified the Attorney General and Dauphin County District Attorney before bringing this quo warranto action. A private party with a special interest in the matter, or who has been specially damaged, may institute a quo warranto action. See, e.g., In re One Hundred or More Qualified Electors of the Municipality of Clairton, at 286 (\u201cA private person will have standing to bring a quo warranto action only if that person has a special right or interest in the matter, as distinguished from the right or interest of the public generally, or if the private person has been specially damaged.\u201d); Zemprelli v. Daniels, 496 Pa. 247, 436 A.2d 1165, 1167 (1981) (Attorney General, district attorney, or private party with special interest may bring quo warranto action).\nWe have never required a private party with a special interest to notify the Attorney General and local district attorney before filing a quo warranto action. Consistent with our long-standing precedent, we hold a private party -with a special interest in the matter may institute a quo warranto action without first notifying the Attorney General or the local district attorney. We disapprove of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holdings in Fraternal Order of Police, Queen City Lodge No. 10 and Bolus insofar as they are inconsistent with our holding. Our decision today is not carte blanche for anyone adversely affected by a public official\u2019s decision to bring a quo warranto claim against that public official. A private person \u201c \u2018must show in himself an interest in the controversy----He must possess some peculiar, personal interest aside from his general interest as a member of the public.\u2019 \u201d Stroup v. Kapleau, 455 Pa. 171, 313 A.2d 237, 238-39 (1973) (quoting Commonwealth ex rel. Schermer v. Franek, 311 Pa. 341, 166 A. 878, 879 (1933)). Mayor Reed had a strong interest in defending his authority to appoint members to the Board, and Clark was an incumbent Board member, who had an interest in retaining his position by protecting the power of his appointed Mayor Reed, to reappoint him to the Board. Therefore, both appellees have a special interest in the ordinance\u2019s validity. Thus, they are entitled to bring this quo warranto action challenging the right of Council\u2019s purported appointees to sit as Board members.\nThe crux of this dispute is whether the term \u201cgoverning body\u201d in 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5610(a)(1) includes the mayor of a third class city governed under the mayor-council Plan A form. This statutory interpretation matter is a purely legal question; thus, \u201cour standard of review is de novo and scope of review is plenary.\u201d In re Milton Hershey School, at 1261. In statutory interpretation, the General Assembly\u2019s intent is paramount. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). When a statute is unambiguous, the plain meaning of the statute shall control. Id., \u00a7 1921(b).\nAppellants argue the term \u201cgoverning body\u201d encompasses only Council and does not include the mayor. Disputing the trial court\u2019s reliance on the provision of \u201cgoverning personnel,\u201d see 53 P.S. \u00a7 41402, appellants claim the provision is only \u201c \u2018a mere recitation of municipal offices.\u2019 \u201d Appellants\u2019 Brief, at 21-22 (quoting City Council of City of Bethlehem v. Marcincin, 512 Pa. 1, 515 A.2d 1320,1325 (1986)). Appellants observe the General Assembly consistently defined \u201cgoverning body\u201d as \u201ccity council\u201d in various other statutes, and \u201cwhen it desires a mayor to hold appointment power, specifically so designates.\u201d Id., at 15, 17, 515 A.2d 1320; see, e.g., 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 732 (Municipal Consolidation or Merger Act); id., \u00a7 902 (Municipal Reapportionment Act); id., \u00a7 2902 (Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law); id., \u00a7 8422 (Local Taxpayers Bill of Rights Act); 58 P.S. \u00a7 10107 (Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code). Furthermore, when authorizing direct appointment by a mayor, the General Assembly does so explicitly. See, e.g., 35 P.S. \u00a7 1545(b) (mayor appoints members of housing authorities with advice and consent of city council); id., \u00a7 1705 (mayor appoints board members for redevelopment authorities); 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5508(b)(2) (mayor appoints parking authorities).\nAppellees argue the trial court correctly determined Mayor Reed was part of the \u201cgoverning body\u201d under the MAA and thus entitled to appoint the Authority\u2019s Board members with Council\u2019s advice and consent. Appellees observe appointment is a traditionally executive function, and the General Assembly customarily grants appointment power to the mayor. Appellees argue the General Assembly has not defined \u201cgoverning body\u201d in either the MAA or the Third Class City Law, and contend the General Assembly intended \u201ceach municipality\u2019s organic law to identify the governing body.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Brief, at 18. To support the claim that Harrisburg\u2019s organic law included its mayor in its governing body, appellees detail the history of Harrisburg\u2019s charter, which envisioned a strong mayor, and outline the history of the mayor\u2019s appointment power.\nAs appellants\u2019 research demonstrates, when the General Assembly vests appointment authority in either a city council or a mayor, it does so expressly. Neither the MAA nor the Third Class City law defines \u201cgoverning body.\u201d However, \u201cgoverning body\u201d has been defined as \u201cgovernment\u201d or \u201ca group of (especially] corporate) officers or persons having ultimate control....\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 715 (8th ed. 2004).\nWe find the Mayor of Harrisburg \u2014 a third class city operating under the mayor-council Plan A form \u2014 is part of Harrisburg\u2019s government and one of the officers with ultimate control. The mayor is listed amongst the governing municipal officers. 53 P.S. \u00a7 41402; see also Marcincin, at 1325 (\u00a7 41402 is a \u201cmere recitation of municipal offices\u201d). Plan A further vests \u201cexecutive power of the city\u201d in the mayor. 53 P.S. \u00a7 41411. Further, the mayor, with Council\u2019s advice and consent, appoints the heads of city departments and is permitted to remove department heads with notice to Council. Id., \u00a7 41415(c). Plan A thus establishes the mayor as a governing municipal officer and vests the city\u2019s executive power in him. The mayor is one of the \u201cofficers or persons having ultimate control\u201d in a city operating pursuant to the mayor-council Plan A form. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 715 (8th ed. 2004). As the mayor is part of Harrisburg\u2019s governing body, the mayor is entitled to appoint members of the Board, with the advice and consent of Council.\nBecause Council enacted the ordinance here pursuant to Harrisburg\u2019s mayor-council Plan A as chosen by the Harrisburg electorate, pursuant to the Optional Third Class City Charter, appellants contend it is presumptively valid pursuant to the broad powers granted mayor-council Plan A municipalities. It is well-settled \u201c[w]here an ordinance conflicts with a statute, the will of the municipality as expressed through an ordinance will be respected unless the conflict between the statute and the ordinance is irreconcilable.\u201d Marcincin, at 1326. Here, the MAA \u2014 a statute \u2014 already provides that Harrisburg\u2019s \u201cgoverning body\u201d appoints members of the Harrisburg Authority\u2019s Board. We have already determined the mayor is part of Harrisburg\u2019s governing body. The mayor, as executive, has appointment power. The Council attempted to assume this appointment power without holding a referendum to amend Harrisburg\u2019s mayor-council Plan A form of government. Council may not contravene the Optional Third Class City Charter Law selected by Harrisburg\u2019s electorate and substitute its own definition of \u201cgoverning body.\u201d Otherwise, there would be few mayoral powers which Council could not usurp by ordinance. As the ordinance is irreconcilable with the Optional Third Class City Charter Law, it is void.\nBecause the ordinance is void, Council\u2019s purported appointments made pursuant to the ordinance are likewise void, and Council\u2019s appointees are not entitled to hold seats on the Board of the Harrisburg Authority.\nThe trial court\u2019s order is affirmed.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nJustice GREENSPAN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices SAYLOR, BAER, TODD and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\n. Mayor Reed left office in January, 2010; no party has argued this affects this matter, and we will not consider the impact of the end of his mayoralty further. See Rendell v. Pennsylvania State Ethics Commission, 603 Pa. 292, 983 A.2d 708, 717-18 (2009) (case-or-controversy issues are not raised by court sua sponte).\n. The Commonwealth Court properly found this Court has exclusive appellate jurisdiction over cases regarding the right to public office. See Rastall v. DeBouse, 736 A.2d 756, 759 (Pa.Cmwlth. 1999) (this Court has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals concerning right to public office). However, because the Commonwealth Court does not have authority to transfer cases to this Court, we treat appellees\u2019 motion to transfer as a notice of appeal.\n. Appellants also argue the trial court improperly decided this case as a declaratory judgment action when a quo warranto proceeding was the only proper approach. This argument fails; although the trial court opinion summarily discussed the quo warranto claim, its order clearly stated the Board members \"appointed by Council ... are without warrant to hold membership on the [Bjoard of the Harrisburg Authority.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 1/10/08, at 12 (emphasis added). The trial court declared the ordinance void in a separate count of its order. Therefore, the court effectively decided the declaratory judgment and quo warranto claims, properly deciding the entitlement of city council appointees to their Board seats through a quo warranto action.\n. In Hazleton, a divided Commonwealth Court panel ruled Hazleton\u2019s mayor-council Plan B meant city council was the \"governing body\u201d for MAA purposes. Hazleton, at 583-84. The court relied, in part, upon the Optional Plans Law\u2019s definition of \"governing body,\u201d which included city councils. Id., at 582-83 (citing 53 P.S. \u00a7 1-102, repealed December 19, 1996, P.L. 1158, No. 117 \u00a7 2(a)). On appeal, this Court was equally divided and affirmed by per curiam order. See Hazleton, 528 Pa. 604, 600 A.2d 191, 192 (1992). However, Hazleton was an Optional Plan B, pursuant to the Home Rule Charter and Optional Plans Law, 53 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2901-3171, whereas Harrisburg is governed by the Optional Third Class City Charter Law. Further, the General Assembly has since limited the application of the definitional section relied upon by the Hazleton court to municipal charter commissions. Therefore, the statutory definition the Hazleton court relied upon is no longer applicable."}
