{"id": "1223487", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chibe J ustice Maxey :\n. This is an appeal from the decree of the court below concerning a certain schedule of distribution in the above entitled estate. The testator died on February IS, 1890, survived by five lines of descendants. His will, dated January 31, 1890, is in the form of a series of pecuniary legacies of unequal amounts, one legacy for each line of descendants. The residue of the estate is then left proportionately to the pecuniary legatees. Some gifts Avere outright and some were in trust. The gift for the line of descendants represented by his son, George Harrah, was a trust to pay the income to George for life, then to pay % of the income to George\u2019s widoAV for life and subject to the AvidoAv\u2019s interest to pay the entire income to George\u2019s children during the life of each of them \u201cand upon the death of any of such children, to distribute his or her share of said principal sum, according to the intestate laws of Pennsylvania\u201d. The Rule against Perpetuities is involved in this case.\nParagraph III of the will reads as follows: \u201cI give and bequeath to my son Charles J. Harrah, Junior and the Philadelphia Trust Safe Deposit and Insurance Company, their heirs, successors and assigns, the sum of One hundred and fifty thousand ($150,000.) Dollars. In Trust to pay the net income thereof to my son, George W. Harrah, during his natural life, and at and immediately after his death, to pay one-third of said net income to his widow during her life, and two thirds thereof to his children, during their respective lives. And upon the death of said widow, to pay said one-third also of said income to said children, and upon the death of any of such children, to distribute his or her share of said principal sum, according to the intestate laws of Pennsylvania.\u201d\nThe court below adopted the appellees\u2019 view of this case, that is, that the gifts in remainder to the heirs at law and next of kin of Julius T. Harrah are void under the rule against perpetuities. Appellees say: \u201c. . . it is not difficult to imagine that [the testator\u2019s] son, George, might have children, born after the death of the testator, who might, quite conceivably, have children born more than twenty-one years after the death of the last of George\u2019s children who were born in the lifetime of the testator. To the extent, therefore, that the gift in remainder contemplates, among its possible objects, such great-grandchildren and even more remote issue of the testator, it is, by its terms in violation of the rule against perpetuities and consequently void.\u201d\nAppellants contend that \u201csince all of the children of testator\u2019s son, George, including Julius T. Harrah, were born in the lifetime of the testator and since there were, in fact, no children born to George after the death of the testator, the gifts in remainder do not violate the rule against perpetuities. They concede that the will, by its terms, admits of possible gifts in remainder to ineligible persons, but contend that since they have not eventuated, the gifts to persons who meet the tests of eligibility under the rule should not be permitted to fail.\u201d\nParagraph 12 of the will reads as follows: \u201cAll the rest residue, and remainder of my estate, of whatever character, and wherever situate, I give, devise, and bequeath to the legatees named, and in the same manner upon the same trusts, and in the same proportions as I have heretofore devised the bulk of my estate in the first seven paragraphs of this will, . . .\u201d\nTestator\u2019s son George, the primary cestui que trust, died August 13, 1908, and his widow, Thomazinha, died July 16,1916. Four children survived them, all of whom were born prior to the execution of the will and all of whom were alive when testator died. One of the four children, Julius, died on March 24, 1948, leaving three children. As to the three-fourths share of the trust, it continues for the benefit of the three living children of George W. Harrah. The remaining one-fourth share, as to which the trust terminated at the death of Julius, is the share now in controversy.\nThe Auditing Judge says: \u201cAfter the death of testator\u2019s son, George, and of his widoAV, the entire income from the $150,000 trust goes to his children. The Avill then provided: \u2018. . . and upon the death of any of such children, to distribute Ids or her share of said principal sum, according to the intestate laws of Pennsylvania.\u2019 (Italics supplied by the Auditing Judge) . . . disposition of the principal \u2018according to the intestate laws\u2019, in such a gift, is tantamount to a gift of the principal in remainder to the heirs at law and next of kin, as determined by the intestate laws, of the person or persons Avhose \u2018shares\u2019 thus become the subject of the prescribed method of distribution: Schoch\u2019s Estate (No. 2), 271 Pa. 165 (1921); Schell\u2019s Estate, 30 D. R. 335 (1921). It is as though testator had said: \u2018. . . to distribute Ms or her share of said principal (to his or her heirs at law) according to the intestate laws of Pennsylvania\u2019, i.e. to the heirs at law of the children of testator\u2019s son, George, at their respective deaths, and the Auditing Judge so finds.\u201d (Italics supplied by the Auditing Judge)\nThe Auditing Judge, after citing the above referred to argument of appellants\u2019 counsel, points out that: \u201cIt has frequently been held in Pennsylvania that where succeeding estates in futuro are limited one upon another beyond the permissible period under the rule against perpetuities, such of those estates as must by every possible interpretation vest within the limits of the rule may be sustained, even though the vesting of succeeding estates may transgress the rule, unless the principal purpose of the testator appears to be the postponement of ultimate vesting in remainder beyond the limits of the rule. Thus, life estates, which inevitably must vest in the period of a life or lives in being and twenty-one years, are sustained, however remote the vesting of remainders limited upon them, if the primary object of the creation of the trust appears to be merely to insure the eligible life tenants the benefits of the estate for their lives: Lawrence\u2019s Estate, 136 Pa. 354, 20 A. 521 (1890) ; Whitman\u2019s Estate, 248 Pa. 285, 93 A. 1062 (1915) ; Jones\u2019s Trust Estate, 284 Pa. 90, 130 A. 314 (1925); McCaskey\u2019s Estate, 293 Pa. 497, 143 A. 209 (1928); Kern\u2019s Estate, 296 Pa. 348, 145 A. 824 (1929) ; Hecht\u2019s Estate, 316 Pa. 12, 173 A. 324 (1934) ; McCreary\u2019s Trust Estate, 328 Pa. 513, 196 A. 25 (1938); Quigley\u2019s Estate, 329 Pa. 281, 198 A. 85 (1938) ; Kamerly Estate, 348 Pa. 225, 35 A. 2d 258 (1944) ; Schmick Estate, 349 Pa. 65, 36 A. 2d 305 (1944).\u201d\nHe adds: \u201cAll of these authorities admittedly support the argument that were the gift is to a class some of whose members may, under the rule, be eligible and some of whose members may not be eligible, the gifts to eligible members may be sustained and only the gifts to ineligibles must be struck dOAvn. Moreover, the Estates Act of 1947, Section 4(b) now provides that the validity of limitations in remainder shall be \u2018measured by actual rather than possible events\u2019 and would, if applicable to the present case, clearly sustain the remainders to all of the children of testator\u2019s son, George, since they were all, in fact, born before the date of the death of the testator. Unfortunately, however, the testator died in 1890, and the Act of 1947 does not apply. We are therefore obliged to view the possibilities in this case under Pennsylvania law as it stood prior to the enactment of the Estates Act and to apply the rule strictly according to its exact requirements.\u201d He then cites the case of Friday\u2019s Estate, 313 Pa. 328, 170 A. 123, in Avhich this Court said, inter alia: \u201cThe rule against perpetuities . . . should be applied boldly ... If the period testator has chosen may extend beyond the limits fixed by the rule, his provisions are void; but if that period may not, under any circumstances, by the occurrence of events, extend beyond those limits, testator\u2019s bequests are valid.\u201d\nThe auditing Judge then says that \u201cthe Supreme Court has consistently held that Avhere gifts in remainder to a class are void as to any member of the class, they are void as to all members of that class: [citing cases]\u201d He claims that this is the answer to the Restatement [post] and also to the English case of Cattlin v. Brown, 11 Hare 372 (Ch. 1853), and that \u201cThey may represent the state of the law in other jurisdictions \u2014 may even represent the most desirable state of law. But they do not, perhaps unfortunately, represent the state of the law in Pennsylvania as it applies to the present case.\u201d\nThe auditing Judge therefore concludes that \u201cthe gifts in remainder to the heirs at laAV and next of kin of Julius T. Harrah are void under the rule against perpetuities. They therefore fall into the residuary estate, and as the gift thereof is, by its terms, identical with the original trust of $150,000, an intestacy results with respect thereto and the gift over upon the death of Julius T. Harr ah passes to the next of kin of the testator. We reach this conclusion regretfully because it not only frustrates the intention of the testator, but results in an awkward and diffused distribution to widely scattered persons, some of whom are, no doubt, strangers to the testator\u2019s blood, instead of to the three children of the deceased life tenant, who are the natural objects of testator\u2019s bounty and were obviously intended to be the recipients of the share from which their deceased parent received the income.\u201d\nThe Court\u2019s opinion, upon the exceptions to the adjudication, said, inter alia: \u201cWe share in his [the Auditing Judge\u2019s] regrets that the application of the rule in this case results in an award to the testator\u2019s next of kin rather than to those of the deceased grandchild. The change of public policy evinced by the Estates Act of 1947, Section 4, wherein the rule of remoteness must now be measured by actual rather than possible events, so far as instruments becoming effective after January 1, 1948, are concerned, makes our decision the more regrettable, but only the Supreme Court can overrule the former decisions which control us, and so bring about a desirable uniformity of construction that could be applied to all instruments, whether effective prior to or after January 1, 1948.\u201d The adjudication was then confirmed absolutely.\nWe find no reason in logic or in public policy why the whole remainder should be adjudged void because the remainder to the heirs of George\u2019s hypothetical child born after testator\u2019s death would violate the rule against perpetuities. The remainder of the shares held for such of George\u2019s children as were living at the time of his death are clearly valid. We have upheld life estates as valid even though the remainder was found to be invalid. In Kern\u2019s Estate, 296 Pa. 348, 145 A. 824, the question arose as to whether certain provisos in a will breached the rule against perpetuities \u201csince it might have eventuated that the power of appointment vested in female grandchildren could not, in some instances, have been exercised until a period had elapsed sufficient in length to outlaw the power\u201d. We said: \u201cThe weakness in appellants\u2019 contention is in treating the testamentary provisions for decedent\u2019s daughters and those for his granddaughters as though they were inseparable. Gray, in his \u2018Rule against Perpetuities\u2019 (3d ed., p. 342) states, \u2018When gifts are made. to several persons by one description, but the amount of the gift to one is not affected by the existence or nonexistence of the others, then the gifts are separable\u2019; again he states (p. 343), \u2018Although the amount of each legacy is dependent upon the number of legatees, yet, if this number must be determined within the required limits, the gifts are separable\u2019; still again (p. 345), \u2018When, on a gift to a class, the number of shares is definitely fixed within the time required by the ru]e against perpetuities, the question of remoteness is to be considered with reference to each share separately.\u2019 \u201d\nSection 389 of the Restatement of the Law of Property reads as follows: \u201cWhen the provisions of a dis-positive instrument include (a) a limitation in favor of a class under which membership in the class can increase, but can neither increase nor decrease for longer than the maximum period described in \u00a7374; and (b) a further limitation, with regard to each of the shares in which the members of the class described in Clause (a) have been given interests, in favor of the children, or issue, or heirs, of such class member, or in other-language of similar import, then the attempted disposition is treated as consisting of separable limitations with respect tp the distinct \u00a1shares of the several members of the class described in Clause (a), and the validity of the disposition, attempted with respect to each such severed share and described in Clause (b), is determined separately under the rule against perpetuities. Illustration : 1. A, having assets worth $250,000, makes an otherwise effective devise of them to Trustee B, to pay the income to C (brother of A) for life, and after the death of C, to pay the income in equal shares to the children of C for life, and, on the death of each of these children of C, to distribute the corpus to the descendants of such deceased child per stirpes. At the time A dies, C has two children D and E. More than a year after the death of A, C had a third child F. The class gift of income in favor of the \u2018children of C\u2019 is valid (\u00a7387).'The attempted ultimate gift of corpus is to a series of classes, one for each child of C. The disposition is divided into three separate limitations, one for D and his descendants, a second for E and his descendants, and a third for P and his descendants. Determining separately the validities of these three limitations under the rule against perpetuities, the first two are completely valid and the third is invalid as to its attempted disposition of the corpus to a group not ascertainable until the end of a life (P) not in being when A died.\u201d\nIn the instant case the testamentary disposition involves a class gift to life beneficiaries, which is clearly valid, and separate remainders over, of that portion of the corpus for which each life beneficiary had received the income. All of the children of testator\u2019s son George, including Julius, were born in the lifetime of the testator, and since, in fact, there were no children born to George after the death of the testator, it would be an extreme and socially unwise application of the Rule against Perpetuities to hold that all the gifts in remainder were void as violative of that rule.\nAppellees argue that under the Law of Pennsylvania the validity of prior limitations is affected by the fact that ultimate limitations may transgress the Rule against Perpetuities and that the contention that remainders that do not transgress the Rule may be separated and sustained, in spite of the fact that they coexist with remainders that might transgress the Rule, is contrary to the decisions of this Court.\nThe appellants\u2019 brief correctly sets forth: \u201cThe great majority of Pennsylvania cases dealing with class gifts involve Leake v. Robinson, [2 Mer. 363, 35 Eng. Reports 979 (1817)] situations \u2014 i.e., a single remainder to a single class which remains open until the death of the survivor of the class of secondary life tenants. Kountz\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 213 Pa. 390 (1906); Wanamaker\u2019s Estate, 335 Pa. 241 (1939); Rice\u2019s Estate, 16 D. & C. 123 (1929); Miller\u2019s Trust, 48 D. & C. 659 (1943). In others, the life estates are upheld and the decision on the remainders postponed, so that the question is not reached, as in Whitman\u2019s Estate, 248 Pa. 285 (1915) and others of the genus of Quigley\u2019s Estate, 329 Pa. 281 (1938). Smith\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 492 (1879), deals with powers of appointment and presents facts where a special branch of the rule of Cattlin v. Brown could have been applied, although it was not argued.\u201d\nAppellants also correctly point out that in Kern\u2019s Estate, supra, this Court recognized with approval the principle set forth in Cattlin v. Brown, 11 Hare 372, 68 Eng. Reports 1319 (1853), and that the ratio decidendi was the same in each of these two cases. In the Cattlin case the court said, inter alia: \u201c. . . where there is a gift or devise of a given sum of money or property to each member of a class, and the gift to each is wholly independent of the same or similar gift to every other member of the class, and cannot be augmented or diminished whatever be the number of the other members, then the gift may be good as to those within the limits allowed by law. This was settled in the case of Storrs v. Benbow (2 Myl. &K. 46) . . .\u201d\nThere are cases in other jurisdictions which sustain the position the appellants contend for in this case. In Albert v. Albert, 68 Md. 352, 12 A. 11 (1888), the court held that in those cases where it cannot be ascertained what is the share of each member of the class, the gift is void as to all, but when the children of each child form a separate class, the share of each class is separately ascertainable. The gifts to those in the separate class is valid. See also Bowerman v. Taylor, 126 Md. 203, 94 A. 652 (1915).\nIn Hills v. Simonds, 125 Mass. 536 (1878), there was a gift of income to A for life, then to the children of testator\u2019s brothers and sisters equally for their lives \u201cand after their decease to be equally divided among their children or their legal representatives.\u201d It was held that the remainders following the deaths of nephews and nieces who were actually alive when the testator died were good even though it was admitted that the remainders following the deaths of nephews and nieces born after testator\u2019s death were necessarily invalid. The court cited and approved Leake v. Robinson but said that \u201cIn such cases, the person incapable of taking may be the sole representative of the class at the time the estate is to vest, and thus it is possible, at the death of the testator, that the whole estate may vest at a period too remote. But, in the c\u00e1se at bar, the limitation over upon the death of the several nephews and nieces, is not a devise to a single class, of which a child of an after-born nephew or niece may be a member. It is, in legal effect, equivalent to several and distinct devises to different classes [Cattlin v. Brown].\u201d\nIn Dorr v. Lovering, 147 Mass. 530, 18 N. E. 412 (1888), where the facts were strikingly similar to the facts in the instant case, the court followed the rule laid down in the English case of Cattlin v. Brown. The same rule has been applied in the following cases: Shepard v. Union & New Haven Trust Co., 106 Conn. 627, 138 A. 809 (1927); Lowry v. Muldrow, 8 Rich Eq. 241 (S. C. 1856). See also Judge Goodrich\u2019s opinion in Smith\u2019s Estate v. Comm., 140 P. 2d 759 (1944).\nThat the decisions of this Court have, in applying the Rule against Perpetuities separated valid life estates from invalid remainders is conceded. In Quigley\u2019s Estate, 329 Pa. 281, 198 A. 85, we said: \u201cOrdinarily the validity of prior limitations is not affected or disturbed by reason of ultimate ones which transgress the rule against perpetuities. There is a well nigh continuous current of authorities in Pennsylvania establishing this principle: (citing numerous cases).\u201d In that case we cited the following from McCaskey\u2019s Estate, 293 Pa. 497, 508, 143 A. 209, saying that it would be better to inquire whether \u201c \u2018the striking down of the void gifts would, in vital matters, so emasculate his (the testator\u2019s) plan of distribution, as to render it reasonably certain he would not have made the will in the way he did had he known it could not be sustained in the respects in which it must be set aside.\u2019 \u201d We added: \u201cSuch a test makes the question analogous to the familiar subject whether the remaining portions of a statute should be held valid and in effect after part of the act has been declared to be unconstitutional.\u201d We also said in Quigley\u2019s Estate: \u201c ... none of the factual circumstances (here) exist which would justify a judicial invalidation of the prior life estates as being inextricable parts of a frustrated testamentary purpose,\u201d and that to separate these bequests would not defeat \u201cthe organic plan of the testator.\u201d The separability which we thus applied is sometimes referred to as \u201chorizontal separability.\u201d\nThe rationale of the Quigley case applies here. There is no reason why, in determining whether a testamentary provision is void as to a remainder to the heirs of a hypothetical child of the cestui que trust, which child might possibly have been born after the death of the testator whose will created the trust, this court should not apply tlie doctrine of separability as to the remainders of the heirs of each child of the cestui que trust, which later children were living when the testator died. In upholding those remainders which are legal because not violative of the rule against perpetuities we are not defeating the \u201corganic plan of the testator.\u201d That separation of legal remainders from illegal remainders may be called \u201cvertical separability.\u201d\nApril 10, 1950:\nThere is no legal compulsion for us to sustain (and it would be unjust if we did so) the attack which is here made upon the whole remainder under testators will because (1) a gift of income to George\u2019s \u201cchildren\u201d would have included such a child born after the testator\u2019s death and (2) the remainder to the heirs of that hypothetical child is violative of the rule against perpetuities. We decide that the successive remainders provided for in the will of Charles J. Harrah to the heirs of the various children of his son, George W. Harrah, living when the testator died are separable from the remainder to the heirs of a possibly \u201cafter-born\u201d child of George W. Harrah.\nThe decree of the court below is reversed and the record is remitted for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion, costs to be paid out of the estate.\nPer Curiam,\nThe foregoing opinion was prepared by the late Chief Justice Maxey before his death on March 20,1950. It is now adopted and filed as the opinion of the Court."}
