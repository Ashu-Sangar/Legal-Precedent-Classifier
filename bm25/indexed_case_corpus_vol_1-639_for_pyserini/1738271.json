{"id": "1738271", "contents": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nWhen collective bargaining between appellant, the Fraternal Order of Police, Jeannette Lodge No. 24 (referred to as F.O.P.) and appellee, the city of Jeannette (a city of the third class referred to as Jeannette), reached an impasse, a board of arbitration was empaneled in accordance with the Act of June 24, 1968, P.L. 237, No. Ill, \u00a7 1 et seq., 43 P.S. 217.1 et seq. (herein referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d). F.O.P. selected Raymond F. Sekula, its attorney, as its representative on the board while Jeannette chose George A. Conti, Jr., its solicitor, as its representative on the board. Pursuant to the procedure mandated by the Act, those two arbitrators chose an independent arbitrator from the American Arbitration Association to fill the third position on the board.\nAfter an arbitration hearing was held, the independent arbitrator submitted an award. This award provided (among other things) that members of Jeannette\u2019s police force could retire from the force with full benefits after a straight twenty years of service. Copies of the independent arbitrator\u2019s award were forwarded to Conti and Sekula for review.\nOn January 20, 1976, after review Sekula (the F.O.P. arbitrator) concurred in writing to the independent arbitrator\u2019s award, Sekula forwarded his copy of the award to Conti (Jeannette\u2019s arbitrator). On January 21, 1976, Conti dissented from the award and forwarded Conti\u2019s and Sekula\u2019s copies of the award to the independent arbitrator. The independent arbitrator forwarded same to the American Arbitration Association and on February 2, 1976, the American Arbitration Association sent copies of the award to all parties concerned. Receipt of these copies occurred on February 5, 1976.\nOn March 8, 1976, Jeannette filed an application in Commonwealth Court for review of the board\u2019s award. The Commonwealth Court granted said application.\nF.O.P. filed a motion to quash Jeannette\u2019s application for review, claiming that said application for review was untimely because it was not filed \u201cthirty days after the date of the award\u201d as mandated by Pa.R.J.A. 2101. (Emphasis added.)\nWithout addressing the timeliness of Jeannette\u2019s application for review, the Commonwealth Court set aside the board\u2019s award. That court held that the board\u2019s award was illegal because the award required that Jeannette pay increased police pension benefits in an amount which would force Jeannette to violate the act of June 21, 1957, P.L. 378, No. 202, \u00a7 3 as amended, 53 P.S. 39305, which prohibits a third class city from contributing more than three percent of its tax revenue to a police pension fund.\nF.O.P. filed a petition for allowance of appeal with this Court which was granted.\nIn its appeal to this Court, F.O.P. raises two issues: 1) that the Commonwealth Court erred in hearing Jeannette\u2019s application for review since said review was untimely 2) that the Commonwealth Court, in holding that the board\u2019s award was illegal, erred in setting aside said award.\nWe hold that while it was proper for the Commonwealth Court to hear Jeannette\u2019s application for review, the Commonwealth Court erred in setting aside the board\u2019s award.\nAll applications for review (appeal) of a board of arbitration award must be filed within \u201cthirty days after the date of the award\u201d. Pa.R.J.A. 2101. Section 217.7 of the Act requires that \u201cthe determination of the majority of the board of arbitration shall be final on the issue or issues in dispute . . . . Such determination shall be in writing and a copy thereof shall be forwarded to both parties to the dispute.\u201d F.O.P.\u2019s contention that January 20, 1976 (the day that a majority of the board executed the award) should be considered \u201cthe date of award\u201d and that, therefore, Jeannette\u2019s March 8, 1976 application for review was not filed within thirty days is without merit. The date that the parties received a copy of the award, February 5, 1976, is \u201cthe date of the award\u201d. Therefore, Jeannette\u2019s March 8, 1976 filing was within thirty days and, thus, timely.\nF.O.P.\u2019s second contention, that the Commonwealth Court erred in setting aside the board\u2019s award, is correct. The Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding was predicated upon an assumption that the awarding of increased pension benefits would require Jeannette to contribute more than three percent of its tax revenues to the. police pension fund in violation of 53 P.S. 39305. The aforementioned assumption is erroneous since police pension funds may receive contributions from many sources other than Jeannette, such as the Commonwealth, private gifts, as well as police fund raising activities.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and the board of arbitration\u2019s award is reinstated.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which O\u2019BRIEN and POMEROY, JJ., joined.\nNIX, J., concurred in the result.\nEAGEN, C. J., dissents.\n. This was rescinded by Pa.R.A.P. 5104, effective July 1, 1976.\n. The thirtieth day, March 6, 1976, was a Saturday. Since appeals cannot be filed on Saturday or Sunday, the \u201cthirtieth day\u201d was extended to Monday, March 8, 1976.\n. For instance, 53 P.S. 39307 allows a third class city to take \u201cgift(s), grant(s), devise(s) or bequest(s), (and) mon(ies) or propert(ies)\u201d that are contributed for the benefit of a police pension fund. Act of June 23, 1931, P.L. 932, art. XLIII, \u00a7 4307 as amended, 53 P.S. 39307."}
