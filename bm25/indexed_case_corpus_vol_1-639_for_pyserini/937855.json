{"id": "937855", "contents": "Peb Cubiam,\nThe evidence in these cases does not raise the slightest doubt about the guilt of the appellants, or the degree of it, the fairness of their trial, or the correctness of the rulings of the trial judge on the law as applicable to the evidence.\nThe specifications of error are all of them immaterial and most of them frivolous. So far as the points raised would justify notice they are sufficiently discussed, in the opinion of the court below refusing a new trial.\nThe judgments are affirmed and the records remitted for purpose of execution."}
