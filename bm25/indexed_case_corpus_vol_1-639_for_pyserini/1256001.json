{"id": "1256001", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nRelator\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus re extradition proceedings could be dismissed because of petitioner\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 45 of this Court relating to the service of copies of brief and record. Since, however, the appeal relates to the extradition of relator to a sister state, and the single question is one of identity, we have concluded to pass upon the merits and have examined the original record with the notes of testimony. We agree with the hearing judge that relator was sufficiently identified by two witnesses.\nThe denial of relator\u2019s petition by the court below is affirmed on the opinion of Judge Bok."}
