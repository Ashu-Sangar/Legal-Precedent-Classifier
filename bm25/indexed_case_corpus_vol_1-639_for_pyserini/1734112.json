{"id": "1734112", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nNIX, Justice.\nThis is an appeal by the Commonwealth from an Order of the Superior Court affirming the suppression of a statement sought to be introduced by the Commonwealth at the trial of Patrick McLaughlin. Appellee, McLaughlin, was indicted on charges of having defrauded the City of Philadelphia of more than $20,000.00 by submitting to the City Comptroller\u2019s Office forged and fraudulent reimbursement vouchers.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at the hearing adduced the following facts. Appellee was employed by contract with the City of Philadelphia as a Federal Coordinator in Washington, D. C. The annual contract provided for a maximum of $5,000.00 in expenses to be reimbursed, in addition to a salary. On April 23, 1971, McLaughlin received an administrative subpoena from the Office of the City Comptroller requesting that he explain certain allegedly falsified expense vouchers. Accordingly, McLaughlin appeared on April 29, 1971, was sworn and then questioned by Mr. Gilbert Stein, First Deputy Comptroller. A statement by McLaughlin was recorded by a stenographer.\nThe City Comptroller thereafter sent to the Philadelphia District Attorney a report of his investigation and, after further investigation, prosecution of McLaughlin for multiple fraud offenses was initiated, and indictments were issued. Appellee filed a motion to suppress the statement taken on April 29, 1971, and, after a hearing held on August 1, 1972, the motion was granted by the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. The statement was held to be inadmissible on the grounds that 1) appellee did not \u201cknowingly and willingly waive his constitutional rights,\u201d and 2) the statement was the product of \u201cofficial compulsion\u201d and \u201cpsychological coercion.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court which entered an order quashing the appeal on the ground that the Commonwealth failed to show that it would be substantially handicapped by the absence of the suppressed evidence. This Court subsequently reversed and remanded the case back to the Superior Court for a determination on the merits of the motion. Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, an order of May 8, 1974. On remand, the Superior Court affirmed the suppression order on the ground that appellee had not been given Miranda warnings prior to questioning by the Comptroller\u2019s Office, but specifically did not reach the question whether appellee\u2019s statement was \u201cvoluntary\u201d. This appeal followed.\nAppellant challenges the suppression of appellee\u2019s statement. First they contend the statement should not have been suppressed because Miranda warnings are not required before questioning pursuant to a non-custodial administrative investigation.\nThe Miranda decision established that a person must be warned of his Fifth Amendment rights before any \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d takes place, and that \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d means \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). In Pennsylvania \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d has been interpreted to mean either questioning \u2018while in custody or while the object of an investigation of which he is the focus, . . . \u2019 Commonwealth v. Feldman, 432 Pa. 428, 432-33, 248 A.2d 1, 3 (1968).\u201d Commonwealth v. D\u2019Nicuola, 448 Pa. 54, 57, 292 A.2d 333, 335 (1972) (Emphasis added). Subsequent to these Pennsylvania cases, the United States Supreme Court in Beckwith v. United States, 425 U.S. 341, 96 S.Ct. 1612, 48 L.Ed.2d 1 (1976) explained that the Miranda Court \u201cspecifically defined \u2018focus,\u2019 [of an investigation] for its purposes, as \u2018questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his action in any significant way.\u2019 384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. [1602] at 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d at 706 (emphasis supplied).\u201d Id. at 347, 96 S.Ct. at 1616. See also, Oregon v. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 492, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977). In the Beckwith case, the Supreme Court held that even though the focus of an investigation may have been on Beckwith at the time of the interview in that his tax liability was under scrutiny, he was not in the custodial situation described by the Miranda Court as the basis for its holding.\nAlthough by our placing of \u201cobject of an investigation\u201d in the disjunctive with the custodial requirement, it might appear as though the Pennsylvania interpretation of when Miranda warnings are required was broader than the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation, an examination of the facts taken with the language of the Pennsylvania cases indicates those cases may be interpreted as being harmonious with Beckwith. In each case recognizing the defendant as the focus of an investigation, there was also present a degree of \u201cdeprivation of liberty\u201d which the Beckwith Court found Miranda to require. Commonwealth v. D\u2019Nicuola, supra; Commonwealth v. Simala, 434 Pa. 219, 252 A.2d 575 (1969); Commonwealth v. Jefferson, 423 Pa. 541, 226 A.2d 765 (1967). In D\u2019Nicuola, the police found D\u2019Nicuola in his car with a revolver which had recently been fired. He was in a comatose condition as a result of an apparent suicide attempt by drug overdose. The police questioned him in a hospital where he was a patient and they had reason to believe D\u2019Nicuola was acquainted with a person who the police knew was missing. In that case this Court said:\n\u201cClearly, while appellant was confined to his hospital room his \u2018freedom of action\u2019 was restricted and this \u2018custody\u2019 coupled with the accusatory nature of the interview, mandates our conclusion that appellant\u2019s constitutional rights were violated when he was not given the Miranda warnings before the \u2018custodial interrogation\u2019 began.\u201d Id. 448 Pa. at 58, 292 A.2d at 336.\nSimilarly, in Jefferson, a statement was made by the accused in response to questions in a hospital by a policeman who knew there had been a stabbing in the hospital and that Jefferson, by her own admission, was the perpetrator. There we held that custodial interrogation is not limited to the police station so that Jefferson should have been given Miranda warnings before the questioning. Jefferson simply stands for the proposition that the critical factor is not the location of the interrogation but the degree of deprivation of liberty by police authorities. Likewise, in those cases where this Court declined to characterize the speaker as the focus of an investigation, there was no deprivation of liberty. Commonwealth v. Columbia Investment Corporation, 457 Pa. 353, 325 A.2d 289 (1974); Commonwealth v. Feldman, supra. Therefore, it is clear that under the Beckwith interpretation of Miranda, the instant appellee would not have been entitled to Miranda warnings since he was clearly not in \u201ccustody\u201d during this interrogation.\nEven if we were to accept the view that our cases have delineated a broader protection for Pennsylvania pursuant to the mandates of its Constitution, we nevertheless under the facts of this case would reach the same result. There have been no cases in this jurisdiction that have ever suggested that Miranda warnings were to be required in investigations which were non-criminal in nature. McLaughlin was only the object of an administrative investigation at the time of the interview on April 29, 1971. The purpose of the investigation pursuant to the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, Section 6-402 was to determine whether McLaughlin was entitled to be reimbursed for his alleged expenses. It was conducted by a City official, not a law officer. He voluntarily appeared in response to an administrative subpoena which carried no sanction for failure to appear except non-payment of the questioned expense vouchers and he was free to leave the interview at all times. The fact that information obtained during the course of this interrogation ultimately resulted in the initiation of criminal prosecution does not change the character of the interrogation itself.\nIn more compelling situations than the present instance this Court has declined to find that the accused was entitled to Miranda warnings. In Feldman, we held that the initial interrogation of the accused at a police station was permissible although it was conducted at a time that police officials had reason to believe that on the night of the killing the accused had blood on her person and that she had stated that she was leaving for a \u201cshort vacation\u201d. Clearly the facts in Feldman would be more persuasive in affording the Miranda protection than the fact that information that might be gleaned during the course of an administrative investigation might ultimately result in criminal prosecution.\nAn even closer parallel to the facts presented in this appeal can be found in our decision in Commonwealth v. Columbia Investment Corporation, supra. There we concluded that even though the functions of investigating grand juries include uncovering criminal activity and recommending criminal indictments in accordance with their evidence, witnesses before such grand juries are not in the status of accused persons. Id. 457 Pa. at 356, 325 A.2d 289.\nThe finding of the suppression court that the statement was involuntary must also be rejected. Appellant properly points out that at no point during the suppression proceeding did the appellee raise the issue of involuntariness. In the appellee\u2019s application to suppress there was no allegation that the statement was involuntary. Further, when the Assistant District Attorney asked the Deputy City Comptroller whether he threatened to break the contract that the appellee had with the City if he did not sit down and talk with him, appellee\u2019s attorney objected to the question as immaterial and stated there was no allegation of threats in the motion. Commonwealth v. Clair, 458 Pa. 418, 326 A.2d 272 (1974).\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent herewith.\nROBERTS, J., concurs in the result.\nMANDERINO, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nJONES, former C. J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\n. This Court\u2019s jurisdiction is based on the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 204(a), 17 P.S. 211.204(a) (Supp. 1976-77).\n. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966); U.S.Const. amends. V, XIV; Pa.Const., art. I, Section 9 (1968).\n. See also, Commonwealth v. Jefferson, 423 Pa. 541, 226 A.2d 765 (1967) where this Court explained that \u201c[c]ustodial interrogation is not limited to police station questioning or that occurring after a formal arrest.\u201d Id., 423 Pa. at 546, 226 A.2d at 768.\n. The Commonwealth has the power to embellish the minimum rights guaranteed in the United States Constitution based on our Pennsylvania Constitution, art. I, Section 9. For cases indicating a state\u2019s power to provide a higher standard of protection than the constitutional minimum declared necessary by the United States Supreme Court see Cooper v. California, 386 U.S. 58, 62, 87 S.Ct. 788, 17 L.Ed.2d 730 (1967); Commonwealth v. Triplett, 462 Pa. 244, 249, 341 A.2d 62, 64 (1975); Commonwealth v. Harris, 429 Pa. 215, 219, n. 2, 239 A.2d 290, 292, n. 2 (1968).\n. Since the Superior Court did not reach the question of voluntariness, the normal procedure on review by this Court would be to remand the matter for their consideration of this issue. However, since the record clearly establishes that this claim was not raised in the trial court, judicial economy is best served by our disposing of the question and avoiding the necessity of a second remand in this case.\n. Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 323(d) states:\n\u201cThe application shall state specifically the evidence sought to be suppressed, the specif\u00edc constitutional grounds rendering the evidence inadmissible, and shall state with particularity the facts and events in support thereof.\u201d (Emphasis added)."}
