It was said in the opinion of this court: \u201cIt may be conceded that upon the question of the contributory negligence of the appellee this is a close case, but after a careful review of all the testimony we have concluded it was for the jury.\u201d See Reitler v. Railroad, 238 Pa. 1. At the second trial the testimony was substantially the same as at the first, and we find no error in the conduct of the trial.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
