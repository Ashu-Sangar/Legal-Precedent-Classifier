{"id": "1308387", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin B. Jones,\nA jury in a trespass action in the Court of Common Pleas No. 2 of Philadelphia County on May 9, 1960 returned a verdict in favor of Walter Rutecki, defendant, and against Andrew Clark, plaintiff. On May 11, 1960, Clark\u2019s counsel filed a motion for a new trial averring that the verdict was (a) against the law, (b) against the evidence, (c) against the law and evidence, (d) against the weight of the law, (e) against the weight of the evidence and (f) against the weight of the law and evidence. At the same time Clark\u2019s counsel reserved the right to file additional reasons for a new trial after the transcription of the notes of evidence.\nFor a period of approximately sixteen months Clark\u2019s counsel did nothing about the motion for a new trial, neither filing additional reasons for a new trial nor ordering the motion on the argument list. Finally, on September 29, 1961, Rutecki\u2019s counsel filed a motion to dismiss the motion for a new trial for lack of prosecution and to that motion an answer was filed. The motion to dismiss came up for hearing before Judge Vincent Carroll on October 31, 1961 and at that time Clark\u2019s counsel filed no brief nor did lie appear at the hearing. On that date Judge Carroll dismissed the motion for a new trial for lack of prosecution.\nAlmost ten weeks later Clark\u2019s counsel entered a judgment on the verdict in favor of Rutecki and against Clark. About ten days later Clark\u2019s counsel took an appeal from that judgment.\nOn this appeal Clark seeks to raise three questions: (1) that the court below erred in permitting the introduction into evidence of certain Unemployment Compensation and Workmen\u2019s Compensation payments to Clark; (2) that the court below erred in referring to an Act of God in its charge to the jury; (3) that the court below was prejudiced against Clark. Tlie motion for a new trial made no reference whatsoever to these questions nor were they raised in or presented for the consideration of the court below.\nTime and again we have stated that questions which are not raised in the court below will not be considered on appeal: Bechler v. Oliva, 400 Pa. 299, 303, 161 A. 2d 156; Robinson v. Philadelphia, 400 Pa. 80, 89, 161 A. 2d 1; Rosenfeld v. Rosenfeld, 390 Pa. 39, 133 A. 2d 829; Sherwood v. Elgart, 383 Pa. 110, 117 A. 2d 899. Since the only questions sought to be argued on this appeal were not raised in the court below we have no alternative than to affirm the judgment in the court below.\nJudgment affirmed.\nForty days after the new trial motion was filed \u2014 June 20, 1960 \u2014 the transcribed notes of evidence were filed.\nApparently Clark\u2019s counsel did contact Rutecki\u2019s counsel asking that the motion to dismiss be withdrawn. According to Kutecki\u2019s counsel, he agreed that if Clark\u2019s counsel would file a j)etitiori to reinstate the motion for a new trial he would not oppose such a petition. No such petition was filed and Rutecki\u2019s counsel heard nothing further until he was served some months lates1 with a notice of this appeal.\nRutecki\u2019s counsel knew nothing of this until after the appeal was taken.\nIn violation of Rule 63 of this Court, Clark\u2019s counsel failed to notify the court below of the appeal and did not serve a statement of the matters to be complained of on appeal."}
