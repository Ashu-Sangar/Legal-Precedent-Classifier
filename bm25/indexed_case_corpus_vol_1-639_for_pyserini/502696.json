The question now is whether the prothonotary improvidently issued the writ, without recognizance or security having previously been entered or given in the Orphans\u2019 Court?\nUnder the Act of 11th March 1809, this court had concurrent jurisdiction with the Orphans\u2019 Court to take all such security : Smith v. Ramsay et al., 6 S. & R. 573. This power continued tc exist until the passage of the Act of 29th March 1832, Pur. Dig. 1110, pl. 50. This provided in cases of a definitive sentence or decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, the'party appealing therefrom should give security by recognizance with sufficient surety, in the Orphans\u2019 Court or before one of the judges thereof. It gave to the Orphans\u2019 Court and to its judges exclusive power to take the recognizance on appeal from its decree: Chew\u2019s Case, 8 W. & S. 375.\nIt was urged on the argument if no such power previously existed in this court, it is given by the Act of 8th June 1881, P. L. 80. We are not able to find any such grant of power either expressed or implied in that Act. It does not profess to declare in what court the recognizance shall be entered. That is not the object of the Act. Its purpose is to more effectually secure the payment of costs made in this court, and make the return of the record to the court below, obligatory on the party-bringing it here. In order to effect these objects it imposes an additional liability on the party appealing or obtaining a writ of certiorari or of error. It leaves wholly untouched the question in what court the security shall be given.\nThe discretionary power of the Orphans\u2019 Court as to the extent of the security which it may require on an appeal from one of its decrees is expressly affirmed in Commonwealth v. The Judges of the Orphans\u2019 Court, 10 Barr 37. Leaving this power with the judges of that court evinces wise legislative forethought. They know better than any other tribunal what security is necessary to protect the vast and complicated interests which they are required to guard. It follows that the judges of the Orphans\u2019 Court of the county of Philadelphia violated no law in declining to send up the record in the case wherein the relator had not given such security as the statute requires.\nWe will direct the prothonotary to hereafter issue no certiorari to bring up the record on an appeal from the Orphans\u2019 Court without being furnished with satisfactory evidence that security has been duly given in that court.'\nMotion for a peremptory7 mandamus refused, and rule discharged."}
