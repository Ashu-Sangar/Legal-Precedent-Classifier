{"id": "1249621", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nThe Federation of JeAvish Charities presented to the Orphans\u2019 Court a petition for a declaratory judgment. All of the persons having any possible interest, present or remote, vested or contingent, Avere joined in the 'petition.\nIn Eureka Casualty Co. v. Henderson, 371 Pa. 587, 92 A. 2d 551, Mr. Chief Justice Stern said (pages 591, 592) : \u201c. . . whether or not a court will take jui-isdiction of a petition for a declaratory judgment or decree is purely a matter of judicial discretion. . . . It was said in Capital Bank and Trust Company\u2019s Petition, 336 Pa. 108, 111, 6 A. 2d 790, 792; . . the vital factor in the assumption of jurisdiction is the presence of antagonistic claims indicating imminent and inevitable litigation, coupled with a clear manifestation that the declaration sought will be a practical help in ending the controversy: . . \u201d\nThe facts in the instant case bring it within the aforesaid requirements; the problems involved are so unusual and difficult, litigation was so imminent and inevitable, and the peril to the Federation was so great and immediate that we consider this to be an appropriate matter for a declaratory judgment.\nMorris Lifter died August 16, 1948, leaving a wife, but no issue. His will dated January 24, 1947, was long and very involved \u2014 it covered 19 printed pages. Testator, after the usual provisions with respect to his debts and funeral expenses, made certain pecuniary gifts. In the 7th paragraph of his will he created a trust to pay |!60 a month to his sister, who has since died, and gave all the rest of the net income to his wife for her life, with a discretionary power in the trustees to expend principal in her behalf. His wife is still living.\nWe then come to the pertinent and important provisions here involved: \u201cEIGHTH: Upon the death of my wife this trust shall terminate and the principal of the same, as it may then be, shall he paid over and distributed as follows:\n\u201cA. Personal Bequests [There then follow 12 bequests, some of them conditional and detailed.]\n\u201cB. Charitable Bequests [Testator made 5 charitable bequests.]\u2019 -\n\u201c(C)- Residuary Estate\n\u201c(r) All the rest, residue and remainder of the said trust estate shall.be paid over to the Federation of Jewish Charities of Philadelphia for the purpose of erecting, and provided they shall erect (beginning such erection within a period of not more than five years from the date of my death) a building for such humanitarian purpose or purposes as in the judgment of said Federation is most urgently needed at the time of such distributionsuch building to be known as Morris and Effie B. Lifter Building; provided,\n\u201c1st \u2014 that if at the time of the death of my said wife, my said sister Annie Lang is living, the Federation shall bind itself legally to continue the payment to her of the sum of $60 a month as long as she lives; and provided,\n\u201c2nd \u2014 that the building so to be erected shall be free of all mortgages and ground rents and shall be paid for fully with the amount bequeathed to the Federation by me.\n\u201cIn case the conditions of the foregoing bequest to the Federation of Jewish Charities of Philadelphia are not met within 60 days from the date of my death and the gift to the Federation therefore does not become operative, or if for any other reason or reasons the gift to the Federation does not become operative, then and in such case I direct that the remainder of my residuary estate shall be distributed among, and I give, devise and bequeath the same to, .subject to an agreement among them to pay my sister $60 a month as aforesaid, those persons-to whom I have made-bequests -under items (a) to (1) both inclusive, of this paragraph, each in the same proportion, as the amount distributable to him, her or it, bears to the aggregate total to which all such persons are entitled to take under said items (a)'to (1) both inclusive.\u201d .......\nA reading of the will makes it apparent that some of the provisions in the Eighth Paragraph are conflicting or at least create uncertainty:- -'.W\u00ab.-shall -therefore approach the problems in the light of the following principles:\nThe intention of the testator is the pole star in the interpretation of every will and that intention must be ascertained from a consideration of the entire will, including its scheme of distribution as well as its language, together with all the surrounding and attendant circumstances: Lyle Estate, 374 Pa. 344, 97 A. 2d 830; Brumbach Estate, 373 Pa. 302, 95 A. 2d 514; Newlin Estate, 367 Pa. 527, 80 A. 2d 819; Anderson Estate, 373 Pa. 294, 95 A. 2d 674.\nA Court has no power to rewrite a will to supply a testator\u2019s unexpressed intent, or to cover circumstances or conditions or contingencies which he apparently did not for see or provide for.\nMoreover: \u201cThe Court is always reluctant to supply words of material import to a will: Elkins\u2019 Estate, 339 Pa. 193, 12 A. 2d 83. \u2018. . . interpretation is never to assume the proportions of reformation. . .\u2019 \u201d Berger Estate, 360 Pa. 366, 371, 61 A. 2d 855.\n\u201c \u2018Words and phrases may be supplied or rejected when warranted by the immediate context or the general scheme of the will, . . .\u2019: Bender v.

Oliver, 352 Pa. 244, 247-248, 42 A. 2d 602.\nWe shall first analyze, in the light of the foregoing principles, the various- provisions of the residuary gift to the Federation contained in the Eighth Paragraph of the will.. . Mr.: Lifter , directed that- the remainder- of his residuary estate, which arose and, became payable and distributable upon the death of his wife, shall be paid to the Federation for the purpose of erecting and provided they shall erect, a building for such humanitarian purposes as in the judgment of the Federation is most urgently needed at the time of such distribution. Were that all of the testamentary provision its meaning would be clear. However, there was inserted after the word \u201cerect\u201d the following parenthetical clause which is the cause of the present controversy: \u201c(beginning such erection within a period of not more than five years from the date of my death)\u201d. The appellants, who are the ultimate contingent beneficiaries, contend that this parenthetical clause was a condition precedent and that it necessitated and required, as, in its isolated context, it clearly and expressly stated, the Federation to begin the erection of such building within five years of the testator\u2019s death. Cf. Thompson\u2019s Estate, 304 Pa. 349, 155 A. 925; Wanamaker\u2019s Estate, 312 Pa. 862, 167 A. 592. It would be unlikely that the testator intended, and as it turned out, it would be impossible for the Federation to begin the erection of the building within five years of his death in the light of the other provisions of the Eighth Paragraph, because (a) the gift to the Federation takes place only upon the death of testator\u2019s wife and she is still living and (b) no one can possibly know until after, his wife\u2019s death the kind of. a building- which .will be- most .urgently needed, at the time of distribution of his residuary estate (after his wife\u2019s death)'; and because (c) \u201cthe building .so .to be erected shall be free of all mortgages and ground rents and shall be paid for fully with the amount bequeathed to' the Federation by me.\u201d, which as above noted was not payable until after his wife\u2019s death.\n. . Appellants, would-avoid these conflicts and absurdities, by. the .ingenious .contention'that .the testator '.meant by the parenthetical clause that the gift to the Federation should take effect only if testator\u2019s wife died within five years after his death, and only if the Federation commenced to erect the building within that five year period. The testator not only did not say that, but equally important, such a construction is contrary to and would utterly defeat testator\u2019s main intent, as well as the general scheme of his will, and it is so far-fetched and unreasonable that it cannot be adopted.\nTestator further provided: \u201cIn case the conditions of the foregoing bequest to the Federation . . . are not met within 80 days from the date of my death and the gift to the Federation therefore does not become operative, . .. then and in such case I direct that the remainder of my residuary estate shall be distributed among, ...\u201d. The Federation, as we have seen, did not commence erecting the building within the period of five years from testator\u2019s death, and obviously they could not pay for such a building in full with the testamentary bequest until they received it after his wife\u2019s death; but they did accept formally and in writing the bequest and agreed to the conditions thereof within 60 days from testator\u2019s death.\nWe hold that this was a sufficient compliance with the language, meaning and intent of this paragraph. The Federation has met or complied with the conditions or requirements. \u201cMet\u201d as used in this sentence does not mean \u201cperformed\u201d; it means \u201cagreed to\u201d.\nWe believe it is clear from a study of the entire will that the testator wished and intended (1) generally, (2) particularly, and (3) by the scheme of his will, to give the remainder bf his residuary estate to the Federation of Jewish Charities, subject, however, to certain conditions: (a) provided they would erect a building for humanitarian purposes; (b) provided tbe building was. known -as \u201cMorris and. Effie B. Lifter Building\u2019? ;Jo) provided; the building- - so \u2022 erected. should be free of.-all mortgages .and ground ren.ts;,(d) provided it woukl not cost.more than the amount bequeathed to the Federation bythet estator; (e) provided the erection of the: building was commenced within five years after, his wife\u2019s death; and (f) provided that the,Federation would agree to accept the bequest with all its conditions, within\u201860 .days. from, the testator\u2019s death., ; ,.t .\nWe are convinced that, the parenthetical clause erroneously expressed testator\u2019s;intention; and that it is clear from the language and scheme of his entire will that the .wqrd \u201cwife\u2019s\u201d .was omitted by mistake from the; ,parenthetical clause; and, .that. his .intention was, as found by the auditing Judge and the Court ,en banc, that the building in question should be commenced ;within a period of -five years from the date of , \u201cmy wife\u2019s death\u201d... .This \u00a1mistake, was- , corrected in and .by the. decree \u00a1of \u00a1the., Orphans\u2019 Court .which interpolated the Word \u201cwife\u2019s\u2019\u2019 in, the proper position in the parenthetical clause,',., thus, 'carrying ,opt., the testator?s>,.general ,;and particular intent;;, \u201e , >\n\u2022 Decree, affirmed.; rall- costs,. as. well; as the fees, and expenses of the guardian and trustee ad litem, to be paid by, the Federation of .Jewish Charities.\n; M,r. , , Chief .
