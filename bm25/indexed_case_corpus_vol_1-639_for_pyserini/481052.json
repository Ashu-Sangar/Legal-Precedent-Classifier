{"id": "481052", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed. Appellant, William Ray Blevins, failed to raise the alleged assignments of error in his motions for new trial and arrest of judgment and, hence, is precluded from raising these questions on appeal. See, e. g., Commonwealth v. Reid, 458 Pa. 357 326 A.2d 267 (1974); Commonwealth v. Clair, Pa., 326 A.2d 272 (1974); Commonwealth v. Goodman, 454 Pa. 358, 311 A.2d 652 (1973); and Commonwealth v.
