{"id": "972704", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nIt does not follow that because a man is a drunkard he cannot make a will. This testator, for anything that appears, was entirely sober when he made his will, and possessed testamentary capacity. Nor is there sufficient evidence to submit to a jury that his will was the result of undue influence. The court below was right in refusing an issue.\nDecree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
