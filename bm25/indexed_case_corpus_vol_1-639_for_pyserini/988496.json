Whether the Commonwealth Court erred in holding that the Borough\u2019s notice of land use appeal was untimely filed where the Borough, an aggrieved third-party objector, filed its appeal within 30 days of the Township\u2019s entry (mailing) of its written decision pursuant to Section 1002-A of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (the \u201cMPC\u201d), 53 P.S. \u00a7 11002-A, and not within 30 days of the Township\u2019s oral vote?\n2. Whether the Commonwealth Court erred in retroactively applying a ruling where the Commonwealth Court acknowledged the state of the law to be uncertain, where the Borough relied in good faith upon the equivocal language of the MPC, and where the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding conflicts with this Court\u2019s holding in August v. Stasak, 492 Pa. 550, 424 A.2d 1328 (1981)?"}
