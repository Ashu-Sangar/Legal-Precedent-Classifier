{"id": "1792385", "contents": "OPINION\nMcDERMOTT, Justice.\nPetitioner is a judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia who desired to be a candidate for election to the seat on the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania vacated by the resignation of Judge Robert Williams on February 6, 1985. On that date petitioner initiated a declaratory judgment action in the Commonwealth Court requesting the court to declare that the vacant seat be filled at the 1985 municipal election and order respondent, the Secretary of the Commonwealth, to send to the county board of each county a written notice designating the vacant seat as one for which candidates were to be nominated at the May 21, 1985 primary election. On February 8, 1985, a petition to assume plenary jurisdiction was filed with this Court. The petition was granted on March 1, 1985 and argument was heard on March 7, 1985. On March 12, 1985, we issued an order denying petitioner\u2019s requested relief.\nThe question before us is how and when that vacancy may be filled. The Constitution plainly gives the answer. Section 13 of Article V of the Pennsylvania Constitution provides:\n\u00a7 13. Election of justices, judges and justices of the peace; vacancies\n(a) Justices, judges and justices of the peace shall be elected at the municipal election next preceding the commencement of their respective terms of office by the electors of the Commonwealth or the respective districts in which they are to serve.\n(b) A vacancy in the office of justice, judge or justice of the peace shall be filled by appointment of the Governor. The appointment shall be with the advice and consent of two-thirds of the members elected to the Senate, except in the case of justices of the peace which shall be by a majority. The person so appointed shall serve for a term ending on the first Monday of January following the next municipal election more than ten months after the vacancy occurs or for the remainder of the unexpired term whichever is less, except in the case of persons selected as additional judges to the Superior Court, where the General Assembly may stagger and fix the length of the initial terms of such additional judges by reference to any of the first, second and third municipal elections more than ten months after the additional judges are selected. The manner by which any additional judges are selected shall be provided by this section for the filling of vacancies in judicial offices. (Emphasis added).\nReduced to its simplest terms, an election is required to fill a vacancy at the next municipal election that occurs more than ten months after the vacancy arises. In the case sub judice, the vacancy occurred on February 6, 1985. The 1985 municipal election is scheduled for November 5, 1985, approximately nine months subsequent. The mathematics are clear enough. The petitioner, however, contends that while the numbers are incontestable they do not mean what they seem to mean.\nThe petitioner notes that the effect of the date of vacancy has in our decisions varied, in different cases, and that because it has varied, he has a case amenable to variation from the ten month requirement. We do not agree.\nRelying on Barbieri v. Shapp, 476 Pa. 513, 383 A.2d 218 (1978) and Berardocco v. Colden, 469 Pa. 452, 366 A.2d 574 (1976), petitioner would have us ignore the ten month requirement of the Constitution and hold that where the vacancy arises before the commencement of the electoral process, the vacancy should be filled through election. He contends that the seat should be put up for election since Judge Williams resigned before the initiation of the electoral process which, according to petitioner, began on February 19, 1985, the date on which respondent sent written notice to the county boards of elections designating offices for which candidates were to be nominated at the municipal primary. See fn. 1 supra.\nPetitioner contends that in fact such is the rule plainly implied in the case of Barbieri, supra, where we allowed a vacancy which occurred less than ten months before the municipal election to nonetheless be filled by election. We did so, not to avoid the ten month requirement, but to fulfill its purpose. The ten month requirement is designed to give notice that a vacancy exists and that it will be filled in the ensuing municipal election. The purpose of the notice is that all know beforehand that an election to fill a vacancy will occur; and that election officials, party officials, potential candidates, and the voting public can prepare to present and hear in a full measure of time the candidates for election.\nIn Barbieri, supra, we held that when a vacancy has occurred because a judge reaches mandatory retirement age less than ten months before an election, or between election day and inauguration day, that this situation constitutes an exception to the constitutional mandate. In that case, the vacancy occurred not because the incumbent resigned, but because the incumbent could not stand for election. The incumbent could not run because he was mandated to retire. The date of his mandatory retirement was known from the day he was born, seventy years before. Thus, we deemed the certain knowledge that a vacancy was mandated, a fact known and knowable to all well before any type of electoral process commenced, that on a given, ineluctable date a vacancy would occur, was sufficient to satisfy the need to know beforehand that a vacancy would exist; and we found that such certainty satisfied the intention and purpose of the ten month requirement. One may choose his resignation for a host of reasons, or be compelled by unanticipated causes, all of which can take the electoral process by surprise and swallow that reasonable period given the public to consider matters of such importance. On the other hand, one\u2019s seventieth birthday, however seeming remote, can be calculated by waning moons and rising suns almost quicker than it seems to come.\nIn Berardocco, supra, a vacancy occurred in the office of district justice, approximately eight months before the municipal election. The vacancy resulted from the decision of the incumbent, Frank T. Hazel, to resign prior to the scheduled expiration of his six year term. At the time of his resignation the district justice seat was already designated by the Secretary as an office for which candidates were to be nominated, since by operation of law the incumbent was in his last year of office. Regardless of the Secretary\u2019s designation the Governor appointed Richard Colden, Jr. to fill the vacancy. Subsequently, Albert J. Berardocco was duly elected, yet the Governor refused to issue him a commission. Mr. Colden remained in office, asserting that his term of office lasted until January, 1978, which was the \u201cJanuary following the next municipal election more than ten months after the vacancy occurred].\u201d Mr. Berardocco commenced a quo warranto action in this Court, and we held that the ten month provision of Section 13(b) does not operate when the normal electoral process of judicial selection \u201chas been triggered by the anticipated expiration of the incumbent\u2019s term.\u201d Id., 469 Pa. at 457, 366 A.2d at 576.\nBarbieri and Berardocco are clearly distinguishable from the present case. Here there was not an anticipated expiration of Judge Williams\u2019 term prior to the ten month period. Judge Williams did not reach mandatory retirement age, and his term of office was not due to expire until 1990. The basis for the exception to the \u201cten month\u201d provision carved out in the above cases, i.e., an anticipated expiration of an incumbent\u2019s term, known to the public prior to ten months preceding the municipal election, does not exist in this case.\nPetitioner argues that despite this distinction, the instant case is consistent in principle with Barbieri and Berardocco, in that the certainty of the vacancy arose before the commencement of the electoral process. However, petitioner has mistakenly assumed that the electoral process commences on the date on which the Secretary of the Commonwealth is scheduled to send notice of the offices for which candidates are to be nominated. Although no specific commencement date can be assigned, the framers of Section 13 determined that the electoral process requires at a minimum a ten-month period to allow candidates and election officials ample time to prepare for both primary and municipal elections. Berardocco, supra, 469 Pa. at 457, 366 A.2d at 576. When, as here, an unanticipated vacancy arises we are not at liberty to deviate from that determination however small the intervening time. Otherwise the ten month provision of Section 13(b) is deprived of its purpose.\nAccordingly, on March 12, 1985, we issued the following:\nORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW this 12th day of March, 1985, Petitioner\u2019s requested relief is denied.\nZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion in which LARSEN, J., joins.\nNIX, C.J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\n. Pursuant to the Act of June 3, 1937, P.L. 1333, art. IX, \u00a7 905, as amended, 25 P.S. \u00a7 2865, on or before the thirteenth Tuesday preceding each primary, the Secretary of the Commonwealth is charged with the duty of sending to the county board of each county a written notice designating all the offices for which candidates are to be nominated at the ensuing primary. In this case, the Secretary was unwilling to certify the vacant seat for the 1985 municipal election because the vacancy did not occur more than ten months before the municipal election. He maintains that an election for the seat is not authorized by the terms of the Constitution since the municipal election on November 5, 1985 will not take place more than ten months after the vacancy arose.\n. We assumed plenary jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to the Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. 586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 726."}
