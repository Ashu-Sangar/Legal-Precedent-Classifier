{"id": "579896", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Jones,\nAt about 4:15 p.m. on September 14, 1969, Henry Stevenson (decedent), sixty-nine years of age, was found lying on the floor behind the counter in his grocery store, at 2801 North Ringgold Street in Philadelphia, suffering from numerous knife wounds; he died at the store at about 5:30 p.m. Appellant was subsequently arrested, on September 23, 1969, and indicted for burglary, murder and aggravated robbery. On June 14, 1971, appellant was brought to trial and pleaded not guilty. The jury, on June 24, 1971, found appellant guilty of first-degree murder, burglary and aggravated robbery. Appellant\u2019s post-trial motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment were argued before the court en banc on April 13, 1972, and denied in an opinion and order filed on July 3, 1972. Sentence was fixed at ten to twenty years on both the burglary and aggravated robbery charge to run concurrent with a sentence of life imprisonment for the murder charge. This appeal followed.\nIn a signed statement, which was admitted into evidence at trial, appellant described the incident that resulted in decedent\u2019s death, alleging that a friend named \u201cMingo\u201d also participated. According to appellant, he was walking with \u201cMingo\u201d at approximately 3:00 p.m., approaching the street where decedent\u2019s store was located, when \u201cMingo\u201d said that he wanted some money and suggested that they go into decedent\u2019s store. Decedent unlocked the door and appellant and \u201cMingo\u201d entered. \u201cMingo\u201d pushed decedent as decedent was going behind the counter. Decedent then turned around, picked up a knife and started swinging. \u201cMingo\u201d ran around to the other side of the counter. Appellant backed away and was cut on the left forearm by decedent. As appellant backed away he saw \u201cMingo\u201d with a knife in his hand \u201ccharging\u201d decedent. Appellant looked at his arm and then decedent hit the floor. Appellant did not see \u201cMingo\u201d stab decedent. Appellant and \u201cMingo\u201d left after searching the store for money. When they got outside \u201cMingo\u201d gave appellant a paper bag full of change\u2014\u201cMingo\u201d kept an envelope. Appellant bandaged the cut himself at his grandmother\u2019s house immediately after the incident.\nThe record further discloses that the left front pocket of decedent\u2019s pants was turned inside out and cut and that his body was blood soaked. Four prosecution witnesses saw appellant on the afternoon of the killing: all four testified that his left arm was bandaged and three testified that he was wearing blood-spotted clothing. One witness stated that when he saw appellant, appellant was carrying a brown paper bag containing change. Appellant told one of the prosecution witnesses that he hurt his arm playing football. He told another prosecution witness, however, that he cut it going through a window on Ringgold Street and that he (appellant) got some money. At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the defense rested.\nAppellant\u2019s initial argument stems from the testimony of Detective Francis McGurk of the Homicide Division of the Philadelphia Police Department, who was assigned to investigate decedent\u2019s death and to question appellant. On direct examination, testifying for the Commonwealth, Detective McGurk read appellant\u2019s signed statement to the jury. Although the statement contained numerous references to \u201cMingo\u201d, at no time during direct examination was Detective McGurk questioned concerning \u201cMingo\u2019s\u201d identity or his alleged participation in the killing. Nor did any of the other Commonwealth witnesses mention that a person named \u201cMingo\u201d was also involved in the killing. On cross-examination Detective McGurk was questioned about \u201cMingo.\u201d Appellant\u2019s attorney established that a person known as \u201cMingo\u201d had been apprehended on September 24, 1969, and had given a statement but was later released and not charged with the crime. On redirect examination, over the objections of appellant\u2019s attorney, Detective McGurk testified that \u201cMingo\u201d denied participating in this incident in his statement and when confronted with appellant on two occasions. In addition, Detective McGurk stated that \u201cMingo\u201d was not arrested since appellant\u2019s statement was the only evidence connecting \u201cMingo\u201d with the crime.\nAppellant contends that Detective McGurk\u2019s testimony as to the statements made by \u201cMingo\u201d were hearsay and that the lower court denied his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation by admitting these statements into evidence. We disagree. Testimony as to an out-of-court statement is not hearsay if offered to prove, not that the content of the statement was true, but that the statement was made. Commonwealth v. Jacobs, 445 Pa. 364, 284 A. 2d 717 (1971); Commonwealth v. Ricci, 332 Pa. 540, 300 A. 2d 404 (1939); Henry, Pennsylvania Evidence \u00a7441 (Supp. 1972); 6 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a71766 (3d Ed. 1940). The statements by \u201cMingo\u201d that he was not involved in the killing of decedent were offered not for their truthfulness, but to show that the statements were made, thus explaining, in part, why the police did not arrest and charge \u201cMingo.\u201d In a similar situation, in Commonwealth v. Tselepis, 198 Pa. Superior Ct. 449, 181 A. 2d 710 (1962), the Court held that police testimony that they had been \u201ctipped\u201d that defendant was conducting a lottery at his store was admissible to show why the police followed a certain course of action.\nAppellant\u2019s claim that he was denied his right of confrontation is also without merit. The Sixth Amendment as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment provides in part that: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him. . . .\u201d The accused\u2019s right of confrontation, which has been held to include the right to cross-examine accusing witnesses, is violated when an out-of-court statement of a third person implicating the accused is introduced at trial. Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1967). As was pointed out in the lower court\u2019s opinion, \u201cMin-go\u2019s\u201d statement did not incriminate or even concern appellant; it merely exculpated \u201cMingo.\u201d Moreover, it was proper for the district attorney to bring such information out on indirect examination so that the jury would not receive distorted impressions of the facts from the new matter brought out by cross-examination. Commonwealth v. Kauffman, 155 Pa. Superior Ct. 347, 38 A. 2d 425 (1944).\nAppellant\u2019s claim that he was denied his confrontation rights is based on Commonwealth v. Ransom, 446 Pa. 457, 288 A. 2d 762 (1972). Ransom, however, is distinguishable since there the out-of-court statements were made by co-conspirators, implicated the accused and were inadmissible hearsay.\nAppellant next claims that a portion of the district attorney\u2019s closing argument was prejudicial and improper. However, appellant\u2019s counsel neither objected during or at the end of the district attorney\u2019s closing argument, nor filed a motion to strike or a motion for mistrial. Appellant, therefore, is precluded from raising the issue now, since he failed to object at a time when any error could have been cured by the court. Commonwealth v. White, 442 Pa. 461, 275 A. 2d 75 (1971).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nMr. Justice Roberts concurs in the result.\nPointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400 (1964).\nId. at 401, 406-07."}
