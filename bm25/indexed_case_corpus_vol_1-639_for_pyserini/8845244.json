{"id": "8845244", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThe plaintiff sued in assumpsit to recover from the defendant the value of approximately twenty tons of peanuts which the plaintiff had stored in bags in the defendant company\u2019s warehouse in Pittsburgh. On March 21, 1946, while the bailment endured, there was a fire of considerable magnitude in the warehouse. Thereafter, the plaintiff made demand for delivery of tbe peanuts, but tbe defendant failed to deliver them. Upon trial of the case, tbe jury returned a verdict for tbe plaintiff in an amount representing tbe full value of tbe peanuts and some interest. Tbe defendant filed motions for a new trial and for judgment n.o.v. Tbe court below in separate orders refused tbe motion for judgment but granted a new trial. Both parties have appealed, tbe plaintiff from the order granting a new trial and tbe defendant from tbe order refusing judgment n.o.v.\nWe shall consider first tbe motion for judgment. That the plaintiff made out a prima facie case in chief is not open to question. He proved delivery of \u2018the peanuts to the defendant, bis demand for them and tbe defendant\u2019s failure to return them. In Farnham v. The Camdem and Amboy Railroad Company, 55 Pa. 53, 61, which was a suit for damages for tbe unreturned subject matter of a bailment for hire, this court observed that \u201c. . . tbe plaintiff in tbe first instance . . . must have shown . . . that he delivered tbe goods to the defendants . . . [and] that their agent called for them and could not get them. There be might have rested to bear tbe reply . . . .\u201d As was said in Schell v. Miller Forth Broad Storage Company, Inc., 142 Pa. Superior Ct. 293, 296, 16 A. 2d 680, citing Logan v. Mathews, 6 Pa. 417, 418, \u2014 \u201cWhen tbe bailee . . . fails to return [tbe goods] at all tbe law requires him \u2018to give an account of tbe matter\u2019 or assume responsibility for tbe loss.\u201d In order to cast upon tbe bailor tbe duty of proving that tbe loss of bis goods was due to negligence of tbe bailee, it is incumbent on tbe latter to show by clear and satisfactory proof that tbe goods were lost and tbe manner in which they were lost: Clark & Co. v. Spence, 10 Watts 335, 337. On tbe other band, \u201cWhen tbe bailee has furnished such proofs satisfactory to tbe court and jury and if such proofs do not disclose lack of due care on bis part, then tbe bailor, if be would recover, must prove negligence on tbe part of tbe bailee and tbe bailee\u2019s negligence becomes tbe vital issue\u201d: Schell v. Miller North Broad Storage Company, Inc., supra, at p. 301.\nIt is tbe defendant\u2019s contention that, upon its proving tbe destruction of tbe plaintiff\u2019s goods by fire and tbe water incident to fighting tbe fire, tbe burden of persuasion shifted to tbe plaintiff to establish tbat the loss was due to negligence of the defendant. That, of course, presupposes tbat the defendant\u2019s exculpatory evidence is credible and will, perforce, be so accepted by tbe jury. But, of course, no such assumption is permissible. The defendant\u2019s proofs in material regard being oral, binding instructions in its favor on the. basis thereof could not be given: Nanty-Glo Boro. v. American Surety Co., 309 Pa. 236, 238, 163 A. 523; Satterwhite v. National Powder Company, 362 Pa. 133, 139, 66 A. 2d 278; MacDonald v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 348 Pa. 558, 562-563, 36 A. 2d 492.\nTbe testimony for tbe respective parties on tbe issue whether tbe plaintiff\u2019s peanuts were destroyed by tbe fire and incidental water was conflicting. Opposed to tbe defendant\u2019s proofs, to which we have already referred, tbe plaintiff offered testimony tbat his peanuts, or a considerable portion of them, were seen in the warehouse after the fire, unharmed. If tbe jury chose to believe, as their verdict implies they did, that tbe plaintiff\u2019s peanuts were unaffected by tbe fire, then, obviously, tbe defendant did not account satisfactorily to tbe jury for its failure to turn them over to tbe plaintiff when demanded. Judgment for tbe defendant n.o.v. was therefore properly refused.\nIn disposing of tbe motion for a new trial, tbe learned court below said, \u2014 \u201cThe evidence has been carefully considered. Tbe jury\u2019s conclusion tbat tbe plaintiff\u2019s peanuts were unaffected by tbe fire \u2014 were still fit for food \u2014 was arbitrary and against tbe weight of the evidence. For this reason, and others which need \u2022not he discussed, a new trial is essential to a just determination of the' case.\u201d In Marko v. Mendelowski, 313 Pa. 46, 47, 169 A. 99, it was said that \u201cwe will not reverse an order awarding a new trial unless a palpable abuse of discretion on the part of the trial judge is disclosed or unless an erroneous rule of law, which in the circumstances necessarily controls the outcome of the case, is certified by the trial judge as the sole reason for his action.\u201d This language has since been quoted with approval' by this court a number of times: see Girard Trust Company v. George V. Gresson Company, 333 Pa. 418, 422, 5 A. 2d 221; Tupponce v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 358 Pa. 589, 590, 57 A. 2d 898; and Held v. Van Tiggelen, 364 Pa. 317, 318-319, 72 A. 2d 73. \u201cOne of the least assailable - grounds for the exercise of such power [i.e., granting a new trial] is the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that the interests of justice therefore require that a new trial be awarded; especially in such a case is an appellate court reluctant to interfere [citing cases]\u201d: Frank v. W. S. Losier & Co., Inc., 361 Pa. 272, 276-277, 64 A. 2d 829.\nThe plaintiff\u2019s contention that the trial court abused its discretion in granting a new trial is based on an erroneous assumption that, by so doing, the court in effect violated the jury\u2019s province of resolving the issues of fact. That idea is, of course, in conflict with the host of eases to the effect that it is the duty of a trial court to pass upon the weight of the evidence and to grant or withhold \u00e1 new trial accordingly. Necessarily, a jury\u2019s verdict will eventually determine the facts. In the instant case there was quite a bit of evidence, offered by the defendant, that many, if not all, of the plaintiff\u2019s bags of peanuts were destroyed in the fire or soaked with water during the fighting of the fire and thereby became unfit for food whei\u00bbeupon they were condemned by local health authorities. There was also evidence that peanuts other than the plaintiff\u2019s were stored in the building at. the -time of the fire so that whether the peanuts observed- by the plaintiff\u2019s witness after the fire were actually the plaintiff\u2019s depended upon the credibility of that testimony. True enough, the case for the plaintiff is sufficient to justify the verdict if his evidence ,is believed, and the defendant\u2019s discarded. It is also true that the special finding of the jury that none of the plaintiff\u2019s; peanuts were in the building at the time the health authorities condemned the remaining peanuts is: consistent with the verdict. But, the fact remains, that the' trial judge felt that the defendant\u2019s evidence was entitled t\u00f3 more consideration than what the jury had. apparently given it.\nThe words of Mr. Justice Shakswood in Reel v. Elder, 62 Pa. 308, 316, are particularly apposite to both of the instant appeals, where he said that, \u201cHowever clear and indisputable may be the proof when it de: pends upon oral testimony, it is nevertheless the province of the jury to decide, under instructions from .the court, as to the law applicable to the facts, and subject to the salutary power of the court to award a new trial if they should deem the verdict contrary to the weight of the evidence.\u201d Entry of judgment n.o.v. would have been improper and the granting of a -new trial was in the exercise of a sound discretion of the learned court below.\nOrders affirmed; costs to abide the judgment."}
