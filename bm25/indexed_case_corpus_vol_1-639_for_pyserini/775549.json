The trial court held that he does not have such power to arrest, and suppressed evidence seized pursuant to what the court considered to be an illegal arrest. A divided Superior Court affirmed, 401 Pa.Super. 490, 585 A.2d 1033.\nOn May 17, 1988, while driving a marked sheriffs vehicle in Armstrong County, Deputy Sheriff Kevin Gibbons observed the vehicle driven by Marshall Leet pass a line of traffic stopped in a no passing zone. Gibbons directed Leet to pull off the road, approached the car, and observed an open can of beer on the front seat. He asked Leet to exit the car to perform a field sobriety test. Leet complied and successfully performed the test administered by Gibbons. Gibbons asked Leet for his papers, and Leet had no driver\u2019s license. Gibbons made a radio check of the status of Leet\u2019s driving privileges and was informed that Leet\u2019s license had been suspended. About this time, municipal police officer Donald Weber arrived on the scene to assist Gibbons.\nWith Leet\u2019s consent, Gibbons moved Leet\u2019s car to a safer parking place; while in the car, Gibbons saw a live round of .357 ammunition on the floor and two paper bags behind the front seat. Subsequently, marijuana was found in one of the paper bags, and methamphetamine was found in the tape deck. Officer Weber then issued citations for driving with an expired license, in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1501; driving with an open can of beer, violating 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3715; and passing in a no passing zone, a violation of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3307. Leet was subsequently charged with the additional offenses of unlawful possession of a controlled substance, and possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance.\nIn the trial court, Leet moved to suppress all physical evidence obtained by the police following Gibbons\u2019 allegedly unauthorized stop and detention of Leet. The suppression court determined, after hearing, that Gibbons had lacked authority to stop Leet for a traffic violation, and suppressed the evidence.\nThe lower courts both concluded that when Gibbons stopped Leet, administered field sobriety tests, and detained Leet while the sheriff radioed for a license status report, Leet was in custody. We agree. Leet\u2019s freedom was sufficiently restricted, and Leet\u2019s reasonable perception that his freedom had been removed was sufficient to establish that he was in custody. Commonwealth v. Lagana, 517 Pa. 371, 537 A.2d 1351 (1988).\nThe lower courts also concluded that Gibbons, whether or not authorized to stop Leet, was acting under color of law, so that state action is implicated and suppression of evidence was appropriate if the stop was illegal. We agree. See Commonwealth v. Corley, 507 Pa. 540, 491 A.2d 829 (1985); Commonwealth v. Eschelman, 477 Pa. 93, 383 A.2d 838 (1978).\nIn addressing the question whether a sheriff may enforce the motor vehicle code as Gibbons did, the Superior Court treated the issue as one of statutory interpretation. The court reasoned that 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308(a) places a duty on motorists to exhibit their vehicle registration and driver\u2019s license upon request only when requested by a \u201cpolice officer,\u201d a designation which does not include the sheriff or his deputies. The court also recited dozens of provisions of the motor vehicle code which refer to the powers and duties of \u201cpolice officers\u201d in the control of traffic and vehicles. The court rejected the argument of the Commonwealth that, on the basis of the common law, \u201csheriffs and deputy sheriffs have inherent power and authority to arrest without a warrant for all crimes, however, committed in their presence, including Vehicle Code violations.\u201d The court reasoned that \u201can attempt to imply power where the same has not been granted by statute would be in direct violation of the legislature\u2019s mandate that sheriffs and deputy sheriffs shall perform the duties imposed by statute.\u201d\nWe hold, however, that the common law powers of the sheriff include the power to enforce the motor vehicle code, and that such powers have not been abrogated by statute or otherwise.\nHistory records that, even prior to the Conquest, the sheriff was a powerful officer, with both judicial and executive powers. Lady Doris M. Stenton, in her historical masterwork English Justice Between the Norman Conquest and the Great Charter: 1066-1215 (1964), provides many details of the powers and duties of the sheriff. The work deals entirely with civil and ecclesiastical law to the exclusion of criminal law, though mention is made of enforcing \u201cthe peace of the sheriff\u2019 as well as \u201cthe peace of the king.\u201d Id. at 79; The Earliest Lincolnshire Assize Rolls, case 542, pp. 95-96. The sheriff nonetheless played a central role in the English civil courts from before the Norman Conquest until the Magna Carta; the sheriff was, at the beginning of the period, \u201ca great local lord.\u201d Stenton, English Justice: 1066-1215, at 80. Prior to the Conquest and in the decades immediately thereafter, the sheriff was more akin to a judge than a law enforcement officer, id. at 48, 55, 74, sheriffs serving at times as appellate judges, id. at 57. Then, in the gradual development of an official judicial class, pleas of the crown began to be removed from the jurisdiction of the sheriff and to be heard by a local justiciar in each shire. Id. at 65-67. Thus, in the civil realm, at least, the sheriffs role evolved from that of judge to that of court officer with authority \u201cto summon suitors to the court, to collect amercements from defaulters and carry out the judgments of the court.\u201d Id. at 67. Throughout the period 1066-1215, sheriffs were \u201cmen with powerful local connections,\u201d id., and often, indeed, with powerful royal connections, id. at 80, 163, 171, 175.\nDespite other historians\u2019 claims that the sheriff assumed \u201cthe air of the errand boy of the royal courts,\u201d Lady Stenton asserts that such a conclusion \u201cis hardly fair\u201d and \u201cis surely an exaggeration.\u201d Rather, \u201c[t]he thirteenth-century sheriff was the head within his shire of a complex system of local government centered on the county town, often on the royal castle, and employing an undersheriff and a large staff of bailiffs or serjeants and clerks.\u201d Id. at 80. Even in the enforcement of court orders, the sheriff was no \u201cerrand boy,\u201d but was authorized and expected to employ often-necessary force. \u201cMany of the early writs ... are addressed to the sheriff ordering him to restore the complainant to seisin.\u201d Id. at 80-81. The procedure replaced the Anglo-Saxon \u201cself-help\u201d remedy, and, in those far-off days, frequently involved the occurrence or risk of violence. Id. at 22-24. <See also id. at 171-172. Even late in the period,\nmany writs [authorized] the sheriff to act on the king\u2019s behalf in a judicial or an executive capacity____ The number and variety of the justices and viscontiel writs directed to the sheriff increased with the increasing volume of business in the royal courts held before justices itinerant. The very word justices implies that the sheriff in obeying such writs was acting through the shire court as a judge in the modern sense. In obeying many viscontiel writs he was certainly acting in an executive capacity only, but it must have been difficult for a hard-pressed sheriff to be mindful of the distinction. But whether the suitors of the shire court were giving judgment in a case brought by one of their number by plaint, or the sheriff was acting on a justicies writ, or was leading the posse comitatus without writ to force a lord to replevy plough-beasts, all these pleas were part of the sheriffs work in the shire court.\nId. at 81-82; see T.F.T. Plucknett, A Concise History of the Common Law (5th ed., London, 1956), p. 92. Mention should also be made of the Assize of Clarendon, 1166 A.D., which clearly establishes the sheriff\u2019s power to arrest in criminal cases.\nIt is a commonplace that in times going back to the Magna Carta, the sheriff was the chief law enforcement officer of the shire or county. Pollock and Maitland, in their opus The History of English Law, provide the following enlightenment:\nThe law of arrest is rough and rude; it is as yet unpolished by the friction of nice cases. Before we say more of it we must call to mind two points in our criminal procedure. In the first place, any preliminary magisterial investigation, such as that which is now-a-days conducted by our justices of the peace, is still in the remote future, though the coroners are already making inquest when there is violent death.... Secondly, there is no professional police force. The only persons who are specially bound to arrest malefactors are the sheriff, his bailiffs and servants and the bailiffs of those lords who have the higher regalities.\nPollock and Maitland, The History of English Law: Before the Time of Edward I, Cambridge, Boston, 2d ed., Vol. II, at 582 (1899) (emphasis added.) Though it may be unnecessary to cite additional authority, Blackstone confirms the common law power of the sheriff to make arrests without warrant for felonies and for breaches of the peace committed in his presence. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Common Law, Vol. IV, at 289. Indeed, such powers are so widely known and so universally recognized that it is hardly necessary to cite authority for the proposition. To make the point, how few children would question that the infamous Sheriff of Nottingham had at least the authority to arrest Robin Hood.\nUnless the sheriff\u2019s common law power to make warrantless arrests for breaches of the peace committed in his presence has been abrogated, it is clear that a sheriff (and his deputies) may make arrests for motor vehicle violations which amount to breaches of the peace committed in their presence. Thus, we search the statutes for authority abrogating the common law power of the sheriff, rather than statutory authority for the sheriff to enforce the law\u2014authority he has always possessed under common law. In other words, although the Superior Court searched in vain for a provision which grants the sheriff an enforcement power under the motor vehicle laws, it is instead necessary to search for a statutory provision which removes the enforcement power of the sheriff (which pre-existed the statute). The latter search is equally vain; there is, in the motor vehicle code, no unequivocal abrogation of the sheriffs common law power to arrest. It is evident, moreover, that the power to arrest subsumes the power to stop, detain, and investigate a motorist who breaches the peace while operating a motor vehicle in the presence of the sheriff.\nIn short, it is not necessary to find a motor vehicle code provision granting to sheriffs the power to enforce the code\u2014 sheriffs have had the power and duty to enforce the laws since before the Magna Carta; rather, it would be necessary to find an unequivocal provision in the code abrogating the sheriffs power in order to conclude that the sheriff may not enforce the code.\nIt has been argued that to protect public safety, anyone who enforces the motor vehicle laws should be required to undergo training appropriate to the duties. It is certainly within the proper function of government and in keeping with the realities of the modem world to require adequate training of those who enforce the law with firearms. Policemen, to whom the legislature has given primary responsibility for enforcement of the motor vehicle code, are required by statute to undergo formal training prior to enforcing the law. We deem this requirement to apply equally to sheriffs who enforce motor vehicle laws. Thus a sheriff or deputy sheriff would be required to complete the same type of training that is required of police officers throughout the Commonwealth.\nAs the record is incomplete in this respect, we must remand the case for a finding as to whether deputy sheriff Gibbons had completed appropriate law enforcement training, and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nCase remanded.\nMr. Justice LARSEN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nSenior Justice MONTEMURO, who was an appointed justice of the court at the time of argument, did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nMr. Justice CAPPY concurs in the result.\nMr. Chief Justice NIX files a dissenting opinion.\n. This opinion was reassigned to this author.\n. The Assize of Clarendon states in part:\nAnd when a robber or murderer or thief, or harbourers of them, shall be taken on the aforesaid oath, ... the sheriffs shall send word to the nearest Justice through some intelligent man, that they have taken such men; and the Justices shall send back word to the sheriffs where they wish those men to be brought before them; and the sheriffs shall bring them before the Justices....\nAnd the sheriffs who take them shall lead them before the Justice without other summons than they have from him. And when the robbers or murderers or thieves, or receivers of them, who shall be taken through the oath or otherwise, are given over to the sheriffs, they also shall receive them straightway without delay....\nAnd if any sheriff shall send word to another sheriff that men have fled from his county into another county on account of robbery or murder or theft, or the harbouring of them, or for outlawry, or for a charge with regard to the forest of the king, he (the sheriff who is informed) shall capture them; and even if he learn of it himself or through others that such men have fled into his county, he shall take them and keep them in custody....\nHenderson, Ernest F., trans. and ed., Select Historical Documents of the Middle Ages, pp. 17-19, Biblo and Tannen: New York (1965).\n. The issue of the status of a sheriff or deputy sheriff in labor relations law, specifically under Act 111, 43 P.S. \u00a7 217.1 et seq., is not presented in this case. Whether a sheriff is a \"policeman\u201d entitled to compulsory binding arbitration under Act 111, as addressed in Venneri v. County of Allegheny, 12 Pa.Cmwlth. 517, 316 A.2d 120 (1974), is a question not determined by the sheriff\u2019s arrest powers and is a question we do not address in this case.\n. See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6304.\n. See \"Act 141,\u201d or \"Municipal Police Jurisdiction Act,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8951 et seq., and \u201cAct 120,\u201d or \"Municipal Police Officers\u2019 Education and Training Act,\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 741 et seq.\n. We are aware of the Deputy Sheriff\u2019s Education and Training Act, 71 P.S. section 2101, et seq. which will be considered by the fact finder in the determination of whether appropriate law enforcement training has been completed."}
