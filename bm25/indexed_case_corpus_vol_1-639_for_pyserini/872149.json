{"id": "872149", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis case was argued with No. 461, January term, 1894, in which an opinion affirming the judgment has just been filed. The first and second specifications relate to the competency of the witnesses mentioned therein respectively. We are not convinced that there was any error in receiving the testimony of the one or rejecting that of the other. Nor do we think there was any error in the learned judge\u2019s answer to the defendant\u2019s point recited in the third specification.\nJudgment affirmed."}
