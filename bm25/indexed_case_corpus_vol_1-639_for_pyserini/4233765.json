{"id": "4233765", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 25th day of March, 2013, the June 3, 2004 order of the PCRA court is VACATED. For the reasons stated below, the PCRA petition and its amendments are reinstated, and the matter is REMANDED to the PCRA court for review and disposition limited to the issues raised in the PCRA petition as amended, including holding an evidentiary hearing on any claim which the court believes raises a material issue of fact and is not resolvable as -a matter of law, in accordance \"with applicable rules and decisional law.\nOn May 14, 2004, in response to Appellant\u2019s amended Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d) petition, the PCRA court filed a form entitled \u201cNotice of Dismissal\u201d pursuant to Pa. R.Crim.P. 909, indicating that Appellant\u2019s petition would be dismissed, offering that \u201c[t]he issues raised in the amended PCRA Petition filed by your attorney are without merit and/or are waived.\u201d Significantly, on June 3, 2004, the 20th day after the notice, but still within the time period under Rule 909 in which a petitioner may file a response to a proposed dismissal, the PCRA court issued an opinion and order dismissing the petition. On June 4, 2004, Appellant filed a \u201cMotion for the Court to Rescind its Premature Dismissal of Petitioner\u2019s PCRA in Violation of Pa.R.C.P. 909,\u201d claiming that his statutory and constitutional due process rights were violated by the court\u2019s failure to comply with Rule 909. The PCRA court, on June 10, 2004, denied petitioner\u2019s motion.\nRule 909 requires the PCRA court to provide a capital defendant with notice of the court\u2019s intent to dismiss the PCRA petition, and further obliges the PCRA court to \u201cstate in the notice the reasons for the dismissal.\u201d Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(B)(2)(a). Once such notice is delivered to the petitioner, Rule 909 gives the capital defendant 20 days in which to respond and cure the perceived deficiencies. Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(B)(2)(b).\nHere, the PCRA court did not give Appellant the full 20 days to respond to its pre-dismissal notice mandated by Rule 909. As the issuance of the PCRA court\u2019s opinion was the first time Appellant was notified of the specific reasons for dismissal of his petition, he did not have a meaningful opportunity to \u201ccure\u201d the defects in his\u2019petition as contemplated by our rules. See Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(B)(2). This non-compliance with the requirements of Rule 909 necessitates a global remand. See Commonwealth v. Williams, 566 Pa. 553, 782 A.2d 517 (2001); Commonwealth v. Rush, 576 Pa. 3, 838 A.2d 651 (2003).\nAppellant\u2019s application to file supplemental exhibits is dismissed as moot.\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the decision of this case."}
