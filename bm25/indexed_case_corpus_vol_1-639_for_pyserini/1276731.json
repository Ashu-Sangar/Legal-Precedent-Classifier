{"id": "1276731", "contents": "OPINION\nSAYLOR, Justice.\nThe present appeal concerns the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction for simple assault where the defendant has asserted a claim of self-defense.\nOn March 15,1986, at 2:20 p.m., a Philadelphia police officer responded to a radio call at 3142 North Ninth Street. When the officer arrived on the scene, the victim, James Pleasant, emerged from the house and approached him in an agitated state, shouting, cursing, waving a fist in the air, and holding his head with his other hand. Pleasant told the officer that he had been struck on the head with a wrench and pointed to Appellant, Raul Torres, who was on the street about half a block from Pleasant\u2019s home. The officer then proceeded with Pleasant to Appellant\u2019s location. Pleasant there identified Appellant as the man who had hit him, and the officer arrested Appellant. Upon immediate investigation, the officer was unable to locate the wrench with which Pleasant alleged he was struck, and Appellant denied having such a tool in his possession that day.\nPleasant failed to appear to testify at Appellant\u2019s non-jury trial; however, the statements he made to the arresting officer on the day of the incident were deemed admissible by the trial court under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. Appellant then testified in his own defense as to his version of the events. Appellant works as an automobile mechanic, and he claimed that Pleasant arrived at his house around 11:00 a.m. on the morning of the incident, shouting that he wanted his car repaired immediately. According to Appellant, when he informed Pleasant that he could not immediately begin work on his car, Pleasant punched him in the face. Appellant testified that he pushed Pleasant away from him, but that Pleasant threw another punch, and that he then punched Pleasant, causing him to fall and strike his head on some nearby steps. The parties stipulated that Pleasant had received medical treatment for a five-to-eight centimeter wound on the back of his head; that Pleasant was on parole from a state sentence of three to ten years for aggravated assault; and that Appellant had a reputation for peacefulness and honesty in the community.\nThe trial court, crediting Pleasant\u2019s hearsay statements, and disbelieving Appellant\u2019s testimony, found Appellant guilty of simple assault and sentenced him to two years probation and two hundred hours of community service. Appellant appealed to the Superior Court, which, in a memorandum opinion, affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the hearsay statements of the alleged victim in the case after he failed to appear for trial. The appellate court also concluded that the Commonwealth had produced sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction.\nAppellant presents two questions for review. Appellant first argues that the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay statements of the victim under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. Second, Appellant argues that, even accepting arguendo the admissibility of the hearsay statements, the evidence was insufficient to support Appellant\u2019s conviction as a matter of law. We need only treat this latter issue, as it is dispositive.\nAppellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for simple assault because the Commonwealth failed to disprove his claim of self-defense. In reviewing a claim based upon the sufficiency of the evidence, the appellate court must view all the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict winner, giving that party the benefit of all reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. See Commonwealth v. Widmer, 560 Pa. 308, 318, 744 A.2d 745, 751 (2000). A person commits simple assault if he \u201cattempts to cause or intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly causes bodily injury to another.\u201d See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2701(a)(1). Bodily injury is the \u201cimpairment of physical condition or substantial pain.\u201d See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2301. In order to obtain a conviction for simple assault, the Commonwealth was required to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant knowingly injured the victim. See In re Maloney, 431 Pa.Super. 321, 326-27, 636 A.2d 671, 673-74 (1994). Appellant\u2019s own testimony enabled the Commonwealth to establish these elements, as Appellant acknowledged that he intentionally struck the victim and that Pleasant was injured when he fell. However, Appellant, after admitting these facts, offered an affirmative defense to the charge, claiming that he performed the act in self-defense.\nThe use of force against a person is justified when the actor believes that such force is immediately necessary for the purpose of protecting himself against the use of unlawful force by the other person. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 505(a). When a defendant raises the issue of self-defense, the Commonwealth bears the burden to disprove such a defense beyond a reasonable doubt. See Commonwealth v. Samuel, 527 Pa. 298, 303, 590 A.2d 1245, 1247 (1991); Commonwealth v. Upsher, 497 Pa. 621, 624, 444 A.2d 90, 91 (1982). While there is no burden on a defendant to prove the claim, before the defense is properly at issue at trial, there must be some evidence, from whatever source, to justify a finding of self-defense. See Commonwealth v. Black, 474 Pa. 47, 53, 376 A.2d 627, 630 (1977). If there is any evidence that will support the claim, then the issue is properly before the fact finder. See Commonwealth v. Mayfield, 401 Pa.Super. 560, 564, 585 A.2d 1069, 1071 (1991).\nAppellant testified that Pleasant approached him and struck him in the face, that he then pushed Pleasant away, but that Pleasant threw another punch at him. Appellant then hit Pleasant, causing him to fall. Appellant stated that he did not touch Pleasant after he fell. These facts, if believed, would establish Appellant\u2019s claim of self-defense, as it indicates Appellant used force only to protect himself from Pleasant\u2019s unlawful attack. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 505(a). Once this evidence was adduced, the burden was on the Commonwealth to disprove Appellant\u2019s defense beyond a reasonable doubt. See Commonwealth v. Schaller, 493 Pa. 426, 438, 426 A.2d 1090, 1096 (1981).\nDrawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the verdict winner, we conclude that the Commonwealth has failed to produce sufficient evidence to disprove the claim of self-defense. The Commonwealth\u2019s case consisted of the testimony of the police officer, including his recounting of Pleasant\u2019s statements at the scene, and Pleasant\u2019s medical records. This evidence serves only to establish what Appellant concedes: an altercation occurred between Pleasant and himself. The defense\u2019s explanation of the cause of the violence remains uncontradicted, since Pleasant\u2019s statements did not address this point. Furthermore, the Commonwealth did not suggest a motive for the Appellant\u2019s use of force, if not self-defense; nor does the physical evidence presented disprove Appellant\u2019s claim, as it is consistent with both the prosecution\u2019s and the defense\u2019s version of events.\nFinally, we note that the Commonwealth cannot sustain its burden of proof solely on the fact finder\u2019s disbelief of the defendant\u2019s testimony. The \u201cdisbelief of a denial does not, taken alone, afford affirmative proof that the denied fact existed so as to satisfy a proponent\u2019s burden of proving that fact.\u201d Commonwealth v. Graham, 528 Pa. 250, 252, 596 A.2d 1117, 1118 (1991). The trial court\u2019s statement that it did not believe Appellant\u2019s testimony is no substitute for the proof the Commonwealth was required to provide to disprove the self-defense claim. As the Commonwealth has failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellant did not act in self-defense, the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to support the conviction.\nAccordingly, the order of the Superior Court is reversed and Appellant is discharged.\nNIGRO, J., files a concurring opinion.\n. In addition to the absence of evidence in the record to prove that Appellant was the aggressor, there were facts before the trial court substantiating Appellant\u2019s testimony, for example, the stipulations to Appellant's reputation for peacefulness in the community, as well as to Pleasant\u2019s history of violent behavior."}
