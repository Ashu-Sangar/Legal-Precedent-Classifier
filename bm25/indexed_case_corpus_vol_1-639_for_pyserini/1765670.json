{"id": "1765670", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is a direct appeal from a judgment of sentence imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County on a jury verdict of guilty of murder of the third degree. We affirm for want of compliance with the written post-verdict motion specificity requirement of Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 1123(a) and Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975).\nOn February 15, 1979, appellant filed a written \u201cMotion For New Trial And/Or Arrest Of Judgment.\u201d Contained in the written motion was only the following allegation:\n\u201c1. The jury verdict was against the weight of the law and the evidence in this case.\u201d\nThe post-verdict court denied relief and entered judgment of sentence. On this appeal, appellant contends (1) that he should be discharged for want of sufficient evidence of malice and (2) that he should be awarded a new trial because the Commonwealth failed to produce allegedly existing handwritten notes of the investigating officer to whom appellant gave a statement.\nRule 1123(a) of our Rules of Criminal Procedure (adopted June 8, 1973) provides:\n\u201cWithin ten (10) days after a finding of guilt, the defendant shall have the right to file written motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment. Only those grounds may be considered which were raised in pre-trial proceedings or at trial, unless the trial judge, upon cause shown, allows otherwise. Argument shall be scheduled and heard promptly after such motions are filed, and only those issues raised and the grounds relied upon in the motions may be argued.\u201d\nIn Blair, this Court (on January 29, 1975) unanimously stated:\n\u201cThe practice in some judicial districts of ignoring the requirements of Rule 1123(a) is condemned. Henceforth, issues not presented in compliance with the rule will not be considered by our trial courts and appellate courts.\u201d\n460 Pa. at 32 n.1, 331 A.2d at 214 n.1. See also Wiegand v. Wiegand, 461 Pa. 482, 337 A.2d 256 (1975) (appellate courts shall not dispose of cases on substantive issues raised sua sponte). Here, well over five years after the promulgation of Rule 1123(a) and over four years after Blair, appellant failed to present his allegations of error in writing to the post-verdict court. See Commonwealth v. Meadows, 471 Pa. 201, 208-209, 369 A.2d 1266, 1270 (1977). Consistent with Rule 1123(a) and Blair, this Court will not consider appellant\u2019s claims.\nFrom the opinion of the post-verdict court in response to appellant\u2019s \u201cStatement of Matters Complained of on Appeal,\u201d see Pa.R.App.Proc. 1925(b), it would appear that appellant orally argued his present contentions and that the post-verdict court considered them. The post-verdict court\u2019s violation of Rule 1123(a) and Blair, however, does not alter our conclusion that appellant\u2019s present contentions are not properly preserved. This Court uniformly has held that a post-verdict court\u2019s erroneous consideration of orally presented allegations of error will not suffice to preserve the allegations for appellate review. E. g., Commonwealth v. Gamble, 485 Pa. 418, 402 A.2d 1032 (1979); Commonwealth v. Hagans, 483 Pa. 415, 397 A.2d 412 (1979); Commonwealth v. Waters, 477 Pa. 430, 384 A.2d 234 (1978). As this Court stated in Waters,\n\u201cWhere boilerplate variety motions are filed it is often difficult, if not impossible, to determine with precision the issues actually argued before the court below.\u201d\n477 Pa. at 435, 384 A.2d at 237. See also Commonwealth v. Hilton, 461 Pa. 93, 95 n.1, 334 A.2d 648, 649 n.1 (1975). Indeed, the post-verdict court\u2019s authority here to direct appellant to file a \u201cStatement of Matters Complained of on Appeal\u201d arose because of its \u201cuncertainly] as to the basis for the appeal. . . . \u201d Pa.R.App.Proc. 1925(b). This record, therefore, fails to disclose any basis for disturbing the judgment of sentence.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed."}
