{"id": "1893044", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nAn examination of the record in this appeal indicates that the amount in controversy is such that this court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. As in Kungsgaten, Inc. v. Phila., 416 Pa. 352, 206 A. 2d 8 (1965), this appeal under our Rule 68-1/2, was improvidently permitted, and the case must be remitted to the Superior Court.\nThe matter is remitted to the Superior Court."}
