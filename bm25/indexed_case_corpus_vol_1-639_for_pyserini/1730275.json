{"id": "1730275", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThe question presented in this appeal is whether the regulation promulgated by the Pennsylvania Department of Health (Department) subjecting office laboratories of private physicians to regulation under the Clinical Laboratory Act (the Act) is a valid exercise of the Department\u2019s rule-making power.\nThe Act provides that \u201cclinical laboratories\u201d are subject to regulation by the Department. Section 2152 of the Act defines a \u201cclinical laboratory\u201d as \u201cany place, establishment or institution organized and operated primarily for the performance of all or any bacteriological, biochemical, microscopical, serological, or parasitological tests.\u201d On August 16, 1975, the Department promulgated a regulation subjecting clinical laboratories of private physicians to regulation under the Act. Appellants, individual physicians and members of the Pennsylvania Medical Society, brought an action in equity in the Commonwealth Court alleging that the regulation exceeded the Department\u2019s rule-making power. Appellants sought injunctive relief and an order rescinding the regulation. The parties agreed that there were no disputed issues of fact and filed cross-motions for summary judgment pursuant to Pa.R.Civ.P. 1035. Because the Commonwealth Court was evenly divided on the issue whether office laboratories of private physicians are subject to regulation under the Act, it held that the issue was \u201cnon-justiciable\u201d and dismissed the complaint. The Commonwealth Court enjoined the enforcement of the regulation pending appeal.\nWe hold that the regulation is a valid exercise of the Department\u2019s rule-making power. Therefore, we vacate the decree of the Commonwealth Court dismissing the complaint and enter summary judgment in favor of appellees. The injunction is dismissed.\nI\nThe Clinical Laboratory Act, originally enacted as the Analytical-Biochemical-Biological Laboratory Act in 1951, was enacted to ensure that clinical laboratory, testing was accurately performed by competently supervised professionals. The preamble to the Act provides:\n\u201cWhereas, the health and lives of the citizens of this Commonwealth are endangered by incompetent supervision of clinical laboratory tests; and\n\u201cWhereas, a due regard for public health and preservation of human life demands that none but scientists competent and properly qualified by sufficient training in the fundamental sciences and experienced in their applications in the clinical laboratory shall be permitted to supervise the work of such laboratories.\u201d\nThe Act requires that clinical laboratories obtain permits, operate under a qualified supervisor, and satisfy regulations promulgated by the Department regarding the adequacy of equipment, facilities and laboratory procedures. Prior to 1972, the Act applied to laboratories within the definition of an \u201canalytical-biochemical-biological laboratory,\u201d defined as any \u201cplace, establishment or institution organized and operated primarily for the performance of all or any bacteriological, biochemical, microscopical, serological, or parasitological tests.\u201d Originally, the Act exempted: (1) laboratories maintained and operated by the federal, state, county or municipal government; (2) laboratories maintained and operated for research or teaching purposes; (3) laboratories of private physicians who were licensed to practice in Pennsylvania; (4) hospital laboratories; and (5) laboratories operated in industrial organizations and administered by a duly licensed physician. Thus, the broad scope of the exemption suggests that independent commercial laboratories were the primary targets of the original Act.\nIn 1961, the Act was amended. The Department was authorized to adopt rules and regulations for the proper enforcement of the Act regarding:\n\u201c(1) Contents of application;\n(2) Adequacy of laboratory quarters and equipment;\n(3) Means and standards of accuracy of laboratory procedures;\n(4) Definition of unethical practice and unethical advertising ;\n(5) Any other matters it may deem advisable for the protection of the public and for carrying out the provisions and purposes of this act.\u201d\nThe Department was also empowered to verify the accuracy of the work of each laboratory \"using such means and standards as the department shall specify by rule or regulation.\u201d The 1961 amendments also narrowed the exemption for private physicians. Whereas the Act originally exempted all laboratories operated by a physician licensed to practice in Pennsylvania, after the 1961 amendments, only laboratories of private physicians \u201coperated solely in connection with the diagnosis and treatment of his own patients\u201d were exempt.\nIn 1972, the Legislature amended the Act again, changing its title to the Clinical Laboratory Act. The Legislature retained the preamble and the definition of a \u201claboratory\u201d from the original Act, but substituted the phrase \u201cclinical laboratory\u201d wherever \u201canalytical-biochemical-biological laboratory\u201d had been used. In addition, the 1972 amendments eliminated the exemptions for the following types of laboratories: (1) laboratories maintained and operated by state, county or municipal governments; (2) office laboratories operated by private physicians solely for the diagnosis and treatment of his or her own patients; (3) hospital laboratories; and (4) industrial laboratories. Following the 1972 amendments, the only remaining exemptions are for laboratories maintained and operated by the federal government and those operated solely for research or teaching purposes.\nTo implement the 1972 amendment, the Department promulgated a regulation which subjected previously exempt clinical laboratories to regulation under the Act. The regulation defines \u201cclinical laboratory\u201d to include \u201call independent, hospital, industrial, state, county and municipal laboratories and all clinical laboratories operated in private offices and clinics of practitioners of the healing arts.\u201d This regulation applies to all laboratories which were previously exempt under the original Act but whose exemption was deleted by the Legislature in 1972.\nII\nA. Appellants assert that, by its terms, the Act does not extend its coverage to office laboratories of private physicians. The Act is applicable to \u201cclinical laboratories,\u201d defined as \u201cany place, establishment or institution organized and operated primarily for the purpose of . tests.\u201d Appellants contend that the portion of a physician\u2019s office which is set aside for laboratory testing is not a \u201cplace\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Rather, they maintain that a physician\u2019s entire office is a \u201cplace.\u201d Since a physician\u2019s office is organized primarily for the examination and treatment of patients, they argue that a physician\u2019s office laboratory, which is only operated as an incident to that purpose, cannot be regulated under the Act. We do not agree.\nThe Department. interprets the Act to include office laboratories of private physicians as \u201cplaces\u201d within the meaning of the Act. We find the Department\u2019s interpretation to be more reasonable than appellants\u2019 interpretation. The use of the word \u201cplace,\u201d in addition to the words \u201cestablishment\u201d or \u201cinstitution,\u201d is consistent with the legislative intent to focus on the primary purpose for which a particular area is used, in addition to the primary purpose of the larger organization or institution of which it may be a part. By its common usage, the word \u201cplace\u201d may refer to a particular room or area within a larger building or facility, and certainly could be used to refer to the part of a physician\u2019s office set aside for tests. Thus, while the word \u201cplace\u201d may not be entirely free from ambiguity, we believe that the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Act follows from the natural meaning of the statutory language.\nB. An examination of the legislative history of the Act resolves any question of the meaning of the Act in favor of the Department\u2019s interpretation. The 1972 amendments, which deleted most of the previous exemptions, including the exemption for office laboratories of private physicians \u201coperated solely for the treatment and diagnosis of . [their] patients,\u201d evince a legislative intent to regulate these laboratories.\nA change in the language of a statute ordinarily indicates a change in legislative intent. As originally enacted in 1951, the Act exempted all laboratories operated by a physician licensed to practice in Pennsylvania. The Act provided in pertinent part:\n\u201cThis act shall include nor apply to . .a laboratory operated by a physician licensed to practice in this Commonwealth.\u201d\nIn 1961, the Act was amended to narrow the exemption for laboratories of private physicians. Only laboratories used solely for the treatment and diagnosis of a physician\u2019s own patients were exempt from the requirements of the Act. In 1972, the Legislature deleted this specific exemption for laboratories of private physicians and thereby mandated that even office laboratories of private physicians which were used solely for the treatment and diagnosis of the physician\u2019s own patients should be subject to regulation.\nThe Legislature\u2019s elimination of the exemption for private physicians was part of a major substantive change in the coverage of the Act. Prior to 1972, the Act was primarily directed at independent commercial laboratories. In 1972, the Legislature decided that the purposes of the Act could only be achieved if all the laboratories within the Commonwealth\u2019s jurisdiction which performed laboratory tests for Pennsylvania citizens were regulated. All exemptions were abolished except the exemption for laboratories maintained by the federal government, where considerations of federal supremacy are involved, and for laboratories operated solely for teaching or research, where the impact on the public is minimal.\nThe obvious purpose of the 1972 amendments was to enlarge the scope of the Act to encompass all clinical laboratories which perform tests which affect the diagnosis and treatment of patients in the Commonwealth. The Department\u2019s regulation only seeks to effectuate this legislative intent and is clearly within the Department\u2019s rule-making power. The Department\u2019s interpretation is entitled to some deference as the Department is the agency charged with implementing the Act. The Act empowers the Department to \u201cadopt rules and regulations for the proper enforcement of this act with regard to . . . (5) . . . matters which it may deem advisable for the protection of the public and for carrying out the provisions and purposes of this act.\u201d Therefore, where the Department, the specialized agency entrusted with implementing the Legislature\u2019s intent, interprets the 1972 amendments to the Act to encompass office laboratories of private physicians, we find their interpretation entitled to significant weight.\nAppellants assert that the 1972 amendments deleting the specific exemption for private physicians only \u201ccured a redundancy\u201d in the Act because office laboratories of private physicians are excluded in the definition of a \u201cclinical laboratory.\u201d If appellants\u2019 interpretation of the definition of \u201cclinical laboratory\u201d is correct, there would have been no need for the specific exemption in the original Act or as amended in 1961. In effect, appellants argue that the earlier exemptions for private physicians were only surplusage. This is contrary to the principle that the Legislature is not presumed to have intended the provisions of its enactments as mere surplusage.\nIn addition, we find it significant that in 1961 the Legislature narrowed the original exemption for private physicians to exempt only laboratories operated solely for the treatment and diagnosis of their own patients. It is extremely unlikely that the Legislature would have found it necessary to reword the exemption for private physicians, and narrow its scope, if the Legislature believed that the exemption made no difference because physicians\u2019 office laboratories were not within the definition of \u201cclinical laboratory\u201d to begin with.\nC. Finally we do not agree with appellants that the Department\u2019s interpretation of the Act to include clinical laboratories of private physicians is an \u201cexpansive reading\u201d of the statute which violates the rule of construction that penal statutes should be strictly construed. Appellants misinterpret this rule of construction and ignore our case law. In Commonwealth v. Monumental Properties, Inc., 459 Pa. 450, 329 A.2d 812 (1974), this Court rejected the Commonwealth Court\u2019s ruling that the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law must be strictly construed because it contained a penal provision. We noted:\n\u201cThe logical flaw in the reasoning of the hearing court is that, if a statute \u2018contains\u2019 a penal provision, the entire statute must be strictly construed. This notion is strikingly at odds with 1 Pa.S. \u00a7 1928 (Special Pamphlet, 1973). [Statutory Construction Act of 1970, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1928 (Supp.1976)]. Section 1928 directs that although penal provisions are to be strictly construed, all others \u2018shall be liberally construed to effect their objects and to promote justice.\u2019 Id. \u00a7 1928(c). The legislative emphasis is on provisions, not statutes in their entirety. Our cases are in accord. See Commercial Banking Corp. v. Freeman, 353 Pa. at 567, 46 A.2d at 235-236; Verona v. Schenley Farms Co., 312 Pa. at 65, 167 A. at 320; Commonwealth v. Shaleen, 215 Pa. at 597, 64 A. at 798; Koch\u2019s Estate, 5 Rawle 338, 340 (Pa.1835); Commonwealth v. Yaste, 166 Pa.Super. 275, 70 A.2d 685 (1950); Commonwealth v. Hagy, 58 Lancaster L.Rev. 47, 49 (Pa.Q.S. Lancaster County 1962).\u201d (emphasis added)\n459 Pa. at 460-61, 329 A.2d at 817.\nHere, as in Monumental, we are concerned with the interpretation of provisions which are in no sense penal. The Act was enacted to protect the citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania from faulty laboratory testing. The issue whether office laboratories of private physicians come within the Act does not involve the interpretation of a penal provision and there is no need to construe the Act narrowly.\nIll\nThe Clinical Laboratory Act was enacted to protect the health of the citizens of the Commonwealth by ensuring that laboratory tests are performed by competently supervised professionals. Originally the Act was primarily directed at independent commercial laboratories. In 1972, the Legislature decided that the purposes of the Act could only be achieved if all clinical laboratories performing tests which affect the treatment of patients in the Commonwealth were regulated. Therefore, the Legislature deleted all previous exemptions to the Act except laboratories operated by the federal government and those operated solely for research or teaching. The deletion of the specific exemption for office laboratories of private physicians operated solely for the treatment and diagnosis of their own patients manifests a legislative intent to subject office laboratories of private physicians to regulation under the Act. The Department\u2019s regulation including clinical laboratories of private physicians within the Act is a valid exercise of the Department\u2019s rule-making power and is necessary to implement the Legislature\u2019s intent in amending the Act.\nThe decree of the Commonwealth Court dismissing the complaint is vacated and summary judgment is entered in favor of appellees. The injunction enjoining the Department from implementing the regulation is dismissed. Each party pay own costs.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which O\u2019BRIEN, J., joins.\n.
