{"id": "1250889", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nThis is an appeal from a compulsory nonsuit. In such an appeal plaintiffs must be given the benefit of all the favorable testimony and every reasonable inference of fact arising therefrom; and all conflicts therein must be resolved in their favor: Parker v. McCrory Stores Corp., 376 Pa. 122, 101 A. 2d 377; Lewis v. Quinn, 376 Pa. 109, 101 A. 2d 382.\nAll of the facts, including the place and the cause of the accident, are very meagre, but viewed in the light of the foregoing authorities may be thus stated:\nDefendant was driving his automobile south on Constitution Boulevard in the City of New Kensington, Westmoreland County, on December 24, 1951 at about 11:30 o\u2019clock A.M. Constitution Boulevard is a 25 foot wide street running (generally speaking) north and south and paralleling the railroad tracks Avhich were very close to the street. A walk for pedestrians runs along the railroad tracks parallel with the Boulevard and is separated from the Boulevard for a considerable distance by a concrete wall and then by a continued iron pipe fence 3 feet high. The traffic light on Constitution Boulevard was green for defendant at its intersection with MeCargo Street, which ran into but did not intersect the Boulevard, forming as it were a T. Unfortunately young Finnin, who was 11% years old, could not remember or relate any details of the accident. He was badly injured and was lying on the west side of Constitution Boulevard approximately 8 to 10 feet east of the concrete wall and 3 to 5 feet from the intersection of the wall and the fence, with his head toward the wall or fence and his body virtually perpendicular to the wall or fence.\nThe only witnesses of the accident w\u00e9re Mr. and Mrs. Neubert. Mr. Neubert, the defendant, was called by plaintiffs as for cross-examination and testified as follows: . . my wife and I were coming down Constitution Boulevard and we were approaching the light and as we came down the light was red and I was slowing for the light and then the light turned green and I went on through and we were about half way through, across the intersection when my wife turned and yelled to me, look out for that kid and then the next thing I knew I then saw his feet were up in front of the windshield like. . . . Q. Where was Robert Pinnin when you first saw him? A. Well, whenever I first saw him, when his feet hit, whenever I saw in front, fly up in front of the car. Q. That is when you saw his body fly in front of the car is the first you saw him? A. Yes, sir.\u201d\nPlaintiffs\u2019 witness, Trzeciak, a police officer, testified that he interviewed defendant right after the accident and defendant said that Finnin jumped the rail. Another witness, Miles Cable, testified for plaintiffs that he was driving his automobile about a block in back of defendant and \u201c. . . all of a sudden I seen something flying through the air that looked like a card board at a distance, I couldn\u2019t make it out, it went up in the air, came down and went up a second time, . . .\u201d.\nIt is uncertain whether the accident happened opposite the concrete wall or opposite the rail fence, but it was probably the latter.\nDefendant\u2019s car stopped 30 to 50 feet from the spot where young Pinnin was supposed to have been hit.\nDeep sympathy for this boy does not justify a Court\u2019s finding negligence unless the evidence justifies it. We said in Brusis v. Henkels, 376 Pa. 226, 102 A. 2d 146, \u201c . . \u201cThe mere happening of an accident is no evidence of negligence. . . . Plaintiff has the two-fold burden of proving that the defendant was negligent and that his negligence was the proximate cause of the accident:\u201d . . .\u2019: Lanni v. P. R. R. Co., 371 Pa. 106, 109, 88 A. 2d 887. . . . \u2018It is well settled that conduct is negligent only if the harmful consequences thereof could reasonably have been foreseen and prevented: Leoni v. Reinhard, 327 Pa. 391, 194 A. 490; Franzen v. Goodman, 325 Pa. 518, 190 A. 888; White v. Roydhouse, 211 Pa. 13, 60 A. 316; Gaupin v. Murphy, 295 Pa. 214, 145 A. 123.\u2019: Rockey v. Ernest, 367 Pa. 538, 541, 80 A. 2d 783.\n\u201cIn Tua v. Brentwood Motor Coach Co. et al., 371 Pa. 570, 92 A. 2d 209, the Court said (page 575) : c. . . But it is a cardinal rule of law that \u201cWant of ordinary care consists in failure to anticipate what is reasonably probable \u2014 not what is remotely possible\u201d : Camp v. Allegheny County, 263 Pa. 276, 282, 106 A. 314. . .\u2019 \u201d\nIn Lanni v. P. R. R. Co., 371 Pa. 106, 88 A. 2d 887, the Court said (p. 110) : \u201cNegligence is the absence or want of care which a reasonable man would exercise under the circumstances. Maternia v. P. R. R., 358 Pa. 149, 56 A. 2d 233. We said in Miller v. Hickey, 368 Pa. 317, 325, 81 A. 2d 910: \u2018. . . negligence need not be proved by direct evidence, but may be inferred from attendant circumstances if the facts and circumstances are sufficient to reasonably and legitimately impute negligence: Rockey v. Ernest, 367 Pa. 538, 80 A. 2d 783; Bills v. Zitterbart, 363 Pa. 207, 69 A. 2d 78; Turek v. Pennsylvania R. R. Co., 361 Pa. 512, 64 A. 2d 779; Randolph v. Campbell, 360 Pa. 453, 62 A. 2d 60; Wright v. Straessley, 321 Pa. 1, 182 A. 682.\u2019 \u201d\nEbersole v. Beistline, 368 Pa. 12, 82 A. 2d 11, is very similar to and in principle rules the instant case. In that case the defendant driver of an automobile going 35 miles per hour through city streets ran into the rear of a bicycle and killed the 9 year old boy who was riding it. A directed verdict for defendant was sustained by this Court, because even when giving plaintiff the benefit of all facts and all reasonable inferences favorable to him, the facts and circumstances proved by plaintiff were not sufficient to enable a jury to reasonably and legitimately find a want of due care. The Court said (pp. 16, 17, 18) : \u201cThe evidence is insufficient to warrant recovery if it fails to describe, picture or visualize what actually happened sufficiently to enable the fact-finding tribunal reasonably to conclude that the defendant was guilty of negligence and his negligence was the proximate cause of the accident. A verdict cannot be supported on the basis of mere speculation or conjecture. Proof of negligence may be furnished by the circumstances themselves and it is not essential to have eye-witness testimony, but where the circumstantial evidence is offered because direct proof is not available it must provide as the only reasonable inference the conclusion that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant. . . . In order to determine the question of defendant\u2019s negligence the crucial fact to be ascertained was whether the boy, riding his bicycle, was ever in front of defendant\u2019s car at such a distance ahead of it and for such an interval of time that defendant, had he been properly alert, would have been able to stop his automobile and thus avert a collision. . . . The testimony does not furnish answers to any of these questions, [how and when he got onto or in front of defendant\u2019s car] but leaves everything to mere conjecture and speculation; the manner in which the accident happened is not described or pictured so as to be capable of visualization. . . .\u201d\nIn the light of these authorities plaintiffs failed to make out a prima facie case of negligence. There was no proof of absence or want of due care on the part of the defendant and conjecture, speculation, guess or suspicion do not amount to proof. The circumstantial evidence does not provide as the only rea sonable inference the conclusion that the accident was caused by the negligence of the defendant; on the contrary the reasonable inference is that Pinnin jumped off the fence on to or directly in front of defendant\u2019s ear which was lawfully proceeding on Constitution Boulevard with a green light in its favor.\nPlaintiffs contend that the fact that defendant\u2019s wife saw the boy a split second before he was hit is sufficient to prove defendant could have avoided hitting him if he had been exercising due care. The evidence does not support or justify this conclusion. There was no evidence of speed and the fact that defendant\u2019s automobile went 30 to 50 feet before it was brought to a stop is not sufficient under the facts in this case to prove negligence.\nIf a boy suddenly and unexpectedly alights on your automobile in front of your windshield, or even suddenly jumps in front of your car from a fence, it is easy to understand how a startled driver of an automobile could not bring his automobile to a stop as quickly as under ordinary conditions because of the inevitable shock which this startling jump or darting would cause.\nIn this case there was no reason for defendant to anticipate that a child might suddenly jump (or dart) from the fenced off side of this street onto or in front of his car, and consequently there was not sufficient evidence of negligence to take the case to the jury. Cf. Purdy v. Hazeltine, 321 Pa. 459, 184 A. 660; Wilson v. Butler Motor Transit Co., 368 Pa. 479, 84 A. 2d 207.\nAppellants rely on Jones v. Carney, 375 Pa. 32, 99 A. 2d 462, but that case is clearly distinguishable, because the three year old boy had been standing or playing in the street for several seconds before he was struck by defendant\u2019s automobile, and defendant\u2019s explanation of why he failed to see him conflicted with plaintiff\u2019s testimony.\nThe order of nonsuit is affirmed.\nItalics ours.\nIn the Digest of Vehicle Code of Pennsylvania, January 1, 1953, compiled and issued by the Department of Revenue, their chart on \u201cSpeed and stopping distances\u201d shows (page 29) that if a man is driving 20 miles per hour, alertly under normal conditions and under ordinary circumstances, with perfect four-wheel brakes on best type of road surface \u2014 with nothing to startle him, as in the instant case \u2014 a car\u2019s minimum, stopping distance is 40 feet (\u201c18 feet of which are travelled while thinking to apply brakes\u201d). It adds, \u201cHowever in cases of emergency there is invariably momentary indecision on the part of the driver.\u201d"}
