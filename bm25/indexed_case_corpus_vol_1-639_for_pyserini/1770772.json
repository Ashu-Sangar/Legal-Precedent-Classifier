{"id": "1770772", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Justice.\nGerard M. Kenny (Kenny) and his wife, Kathleen Kenny, instituted suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County as a result of injuries sustained by Kenny on November 8, 1973 while riding on a construction elevator powered from ground level by a hoist. The elevator dropped from a high elevation at a construction site in Philadelphia.\nEdmund Kollhoff (Kollhoff) and his wife, Helen Kollhoff, also instituted suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County for injuries sustained by Kollhoff as a result of the same occurrence while riding on the elevator with Kenny.\nKenny and Kollhoff were a pipefitter and sheetmetal worker, respectively, in the employ of Wm. M. Anderson Company (Anderson) which was engaged in construction of the Federal Court Building in Philadelphia. Their respective complaints, which were identical except as to personal data of the individual plaintiffs, named as defendant Alex-son Equipment Company (Alexson) (appellee herein). The complaints alleged that Alexson had leased the hoist elevator to their employer Anderson.\nAlexson joined Piracci Construction Co., a Maryland corporation, as an additional defendant alleging it was the seller of the hoist which powered the elevator. Thereafter, Alexson petitioned the court and was granted leave to join Dominic A. Piracci, Sr., (Piracci, Sr.) (appellant herein) as an additional defendant on the grounds that Alexson had purchased the hoist from Piracci, Sr. rather than Piracci Construction Co.\nOn December 23, 1976, Alexson filed a praecipe pursuant to which a Writ of Summons was issued to join Piracci, Sr. as an additional defendant. The sheriff served the writ by registered mail to the Secretary of the Commonwealth in Harrisburg and to Piracci, Sr. at 2552 Woodbrook Avenue, Baltimore, Maryland, pursuant to the Long-Arm Statute then in effect.\nOn January 24, 1977, Piracci Sr. filed a preliminary objection to the Writ of Summons on the ground that the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County was without personal jurisdiction over him. The Court of Common Pleas dismissed the preliminary objection and denied the motion to dismiss the Writ of Summons. Consolidated appeals from the orders of the Court of Common Pleas were filed in the Superior Court and heard by a panel of that court which affirmed. 428 A.2d 253. We granted allowance of appeal and now reverse.\nPiracci, Sr. is an individual who is not and has never been a resident of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. At all times relevant to this action he was and continues to be a resident of Maryland. Piracci, Sr. does not and has never done business in Pennsylvania nor has he maintained an office or usual place of business here.\nThe hoist alleged by Alexson to have been defective and to have caused injuries to Kenny and Kollhoff, was sold by Piracci, Sr. to Alexson. The sale was negotiated in Maryland where delivery and payment were made. Alexson maintained an office in Baltimore, Maryland to which Piracci, Sr. invoiced the sale of the hoist. Alexson also maintained offices in Gloucester City, New Jersey and Philadelphia.\nThe record fails to disclose what use Alexson made of the hoist after it was purchased from Piracci, Sr. on January 21, 1972. However, almost eleven months later, it appears that the hoist was to be shipped by Alexson, from its Gloucester City, New Jersey location, where it apparently was then located, to Anderson in Philadelphia, where the accident occurred.\nThe facts upon which the lower courts relied as the basis for bringing Piracci, Sr. within the reach of the Long-Arm Statute was that the check with which Alexson paid Piracci, Sr. for the hoist was drawn on a Philadelphia bank and was imprinted with the address of Alexson\u2019s Philadelphia office. The lower courts reasoned that Piracci, Sr. was, thus, put on notice that the hoist would be shipped to Philadelphia. The Court of Common Pleas concluded that it had jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8309(a)(3) which stated that the shipping of merchandise \u201cdirectly or indirectly into or through this Commonwealth\u201d shall constitute \u201cdoing business.\u201d The Superior Court, on the other hand, held that jurisdiction over Piracci, Sr. was obtained under 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 8305 which provided for jurisdiction over any non-resident individual who shall have caused any harm within this Commonwealth.\nThe Long-Arm Statute then in effect set forth three bases for the exercise of jurisdiction over non-resident individuals. Those sections provided that any non-resident individual who commits a tortious act or does business within the state or causes harm within the state by way of an action outside the state will be subject to the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania.\nAlexson argues that Piracci, Sr. should be amenable to jurisdiction under section 8304 which permits the exercise of jurisdiction over a non-resident individual \u201cdoing business\u201d in Pennsylvania. Doing business is defined in section 8309. Subsection 8309(a)(3) states that \u201c[t]he shipping of merchandise directly or indirectly into or through this Commonwealth\u201d shall constitute doing business.\nIn the past, several lower federal and Pennsylvania courts have held that a non-resident defendant indirectly ships merchandise into the Commonwealth when it is reasonably foreseeable that such merchandise will find its way into this jurisdiction. Testa v. Janssen, 482 F.Supp. 1195 (W.D.Pa.1980) citing Washington v. U. S. Suzuki Motor Corp., 257 Pa.Super. 482, 390 A.2d 1339 (1978), see also Kerrigan v. Clarke Gravely Corp., 71 F.R.D. 480 (M.D.Pa.1975). This rule has been held applicable even if an independent middleman ships the product into the jurisdiction and is himself a nonresident. Testa v. Janssen, supra. Furthermore, \u201c[a] single shipment is sufficient to subject a foreign individual or corporation to personal jurisdiction under [sub] section 8809(a)(3).\u201d Columbia Metal Culvert Co. v. Kaiser Industries, Inc., 526 F.2d 724, 728 (3d Cir. 1975). This section is a formulation of what has been referred to as the \u201cstream of commerce\u201d theory of jurisdiction. \u201cThe \u2018stream of commerce\u2019 theory asserts that a manufacturer or seller, by marketing its product in interstate commerce, has submitted voluntarily to the jurisdiction of a state to which it\u2019s product travels.\u201d See: Donohue, Pennsylvania\u2019s New Long-Arm Statute, 79 Dick.L.Rev. 51 (1974); Henegan, Long-Arm Jurisdiction in Products Liability Actions: An \u201cEffects Test\u201d Analysis of World-Wide Volkswagon Corp. v. Woodson, 45 Alb.L.Rev. 179, 189 (1980).\nCausing harm by individuals\nAny nonresident of this Commonwealth who, acting outside of this Commonwealth, individually, under or through a fictitious business name, or through an agent, servant or employee, shall have caused any harm within this Commonwealth on or after August 30, 1970, shall be subject to service of process in any civil action or proceeding instituted in the courts of this Commonwealth arising out of or by reason of any such conduct. Service of process in any such civil action or proceeding shall be effected through the Department of State as provided in this chapter.\nIn the present case, Piracci, Sr. sold the hoist to Alexson which was engaged in the business of leasing hoists in Maryland, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Alexson then shipped the equipment into the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Alexson is essentially arguing that it was foreseeable that the hoist sold by Piracci to Alexson would be shipped by Alexson to Pennsylvania and urges us to find Piracci, Sr. amenable to jurisdiction under section 8304 and subsection 8309(a)(3).\nAlexson has also argued, and the Superior Court agreed, that the hoist sold by Piracci, Sr. caused harm within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, thus bringing Piracci, Sr. within the reach of section 8305. Section 8305 \u201c. . . requires that (1) the non-resident [shall] have acted outside of Pennsylvania, (2) his action [shall] have caused \u2018any harm\u2019 within Pennsylvania, and (3) the cause of action [shall] have arisen out of the conduct causing the harm.\u201d B.J. McAdams, Inc. v. Boggs, 426 F.Supp. 1091, 1098 (E.D.Pa.1977). This section is a formulation of what has been termed the \u201ceffects test\u201d of extra-territorial jurisdiction. Under the \u201ceffects test,\u201d derived from the American Law Institute\u2019s Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 37 (1971):\nA state has power to exercise judicial jurisdiction over an individual who causes effects in the state by an act done elsewhere with respect to any cause of action arising from these effects unless the nature of the effects and of the individual\u2019s relationship to the state make the exercise of such jurisdiction unreasonable.\nUnquestionably, the sale of the hoist in Maryland from Piracci, Sr. to Alexson constituted an act outside the Commonwealth. The alleged resulting harm was the personal injuries sustained by Kenny and Kollhoff in Philadelphia. In support, Alexson maintains that Piracci, Sr. failed to inspect the hoist and to maintain it in a safe and proper manner. In addition, Alexson alleges that Piracci, Sr. failed to warn of defects and/or unsafe conditions of the hoist when the sale was made. Alexson urges us to find that the facts of this case also come within the purview of section 8305.\nWhile we may agree with appellees\u2019 initial statutory analysis of both the \u201cstream of commerce\u201d and \u201ceffects test\u201d theories, the issue of whether Piracci, Sr. can be subjected to the jurisdiction of the courts of this Commonwealth does not end with a finding that his activities allegedly come within the literal language of the Long-Arm Statute.\nThe analysis of whether a state may exercise jurisdiction over a non-resident individual must be tested against both statutory and constitutional standards. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes a limit on the state\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant. McGee v. International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223 (1957).\nIt is well settled that a state court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant only so long as there exist \u201cminimum contacts\u201d between the defendant and the forum state. International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945). The due process clause \u201cdoes not contemplate that a state may make binding a judgment in personam against an individual or corporate defendant with which the state has no contacts, ties or relations.\u201d Id. at 319, 66 S.Ct. at 159, 90 L.Ed. at 104. This requirement is based on the proposition that maintenance of suit against a non-resident defendant must not offend traditional notions of \u201cfair play and substantial justice.\u201d International Shoe, supra.\nIn order for a state to assert jurisdiction over a non-resident defendant, the nature and quality of the defendant\u2019s activity must be such that it is reasonable and fair to require him to conduct his defense in that state. Kulko v. Superior Court, 436 U.S. 84, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 56 L.Ed.2d 132 (1978). \u201cLike any standard that requires a determination of \u2018reasonableness,\u2019 the \u2018minimum contact\u2019 test of International Shoe is not susceptible of mechanical application; rather the facts of each case must be weighed to determine whether the requisite \u2018affiliating circumstances\u2019 are present.\u201d Id. at 92, 98 S.Ct. at 1697, 56 L.Ed.2d at 141. It is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails himself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum state. Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 78 S.Ct. 1228, 2 L.Ed.2d 1283 (1958).\nMoreover, the minimum contacts requirement serves two distinct interests. It protects a non-resident defendant from the burden of litigation in an inconvenient or distant forum and also insures that the individual states, through their courts, do not exceed the limits imposed on them by their status as co-equal sovereigns under our federal system. World-Wide Volkswagon v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 292, 100 S.Ct. 559, 564, 62 L.Ed.2d 490, 498 (1980). Explaining the notion of interstate federalism as a separate due process interest, the Court in World-Wide Volkswagon, stated:\n. . . [T]he Framers . . . intended that the States retain many essential attributes of sovereignty, including, in particular, the sovereign power to try causes in their courts. The sovereignty of each State, in turn, implied a limitation on the sovereignty of all of its sister States \u2014 a limitation express or implicit in both the original scheme of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment.\nHence, even while abandoning the shibboleth that \u201c[t]he authority of every tribunal is necessarily restricted by the territorial limits of the State in which it is established,\u201d Pennoyer v. Neff, supra, 95 U.S. [714], at 720 [24 L.Ed. 565], we emphasized that the reasonableness of asserting jurisdiction over the defendant must be assessed \u201cin the context of our federal system of government,\u201d International Shoe Co. v. Washington, supra, 326 U.S. [310] at 317 [66 S.Ct. 154] at 158, [90 L.Ed. 95] and stressed that the Due Process Clause ensures, not only fairness, but also the \u201corderly administration of the laws,\u201d id. at 319 [66 S.Ct. at 159].\n444 U.S. at 293-294, 100 S.Ct. at 565, 62 L.Ed.2d at 499. Finally in stressing the importance of interstate federalism served by minimum contacts, the Court in World-Wide Volkswagon stated:\n. . . Even if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment. 444 U.S. 294, 100 S.Ct. at 565-66, 62 L.Ed.2d at 499-500.\nIn World-Wide Volkswagon, supra a products liability action was instituted in an Oklahoma state court by respondents, husband and wife. Respondents sought to recover for personal injuries sustained in Oklahoma in an accident involving an automobile that they purchased in New York while New York residents. Respondents were driving their car through Oklahoma at the time of the accident. The defendants included the automobile retailer and its wholesaler, both New York corporations that did no business in Oklahoma. The Supreme Court held that the fortuitous circumstance that a single automobile, sold in New York to New York residents, happened to suffer an accident while passing through Oklahoma did not constitute sufficient minimum contacts to render the New York corporations amenable to suit in an Oklahoma state court.\nThe Court in World-Wide Volkswagon also rejected the use of foreseeability as the essential factor in determining whether the exercise of jurisdiction by the forum state over a non-resident defendant satisfies Due Process.\n\u201c.. . [T]he foreseeability that is critical to due process analysis is not the mere likelihood that a product will find its way into the forum state. Rather, it is that the defendants conduct and connection with the forum State are such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there.\u201d [Citations omitted.] 444 U.S. at 297, 100 S.Ct. at 567, 62 L.Ed.2d at 501.\nThus, although foreseeability of the indirect shipment of a product into this Commonwealth or the foreseeability that an act outside the Commonwealth may cause an effect within the Commonwealth may satisfy the requirements of the Long-Arm Statute, \u201cforeseeability alone has never been a sufficient benchmark for personal jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause.\u201d 444 U.S. at 295, 100 S.Ct. at 566, 62 L.Ed.2d at 500.\nIn Jacobs v. Lakewood Aircraft Serv. Inc., 493 F.Supp. 46 (E.D.Pa.1980) plaintiff brought an action for wrongful death against Lakewood Aircraft (Lakewood), a New Jersey corporation engaged in the maintenance, overhaul, painting and repair of airplanes. The underlying facts as stated in the district court\u2019s opinion are as follows:\nAt some unspecified date, some unspecified person flew from an unspecified location an airplane to be repaired by Lakewood. Defendant, however, knew that the airplane would be returned to Pennsylvania after the repairs had been made. On March 24, 1978, plaintiffs decedent was killed when the aircraft crashed near the North Philadelphia Airport, allegedly because the repairs were negligently done by Lakewood.\nId. at 48.\nLakewood was not licensed to do business in Pennsylvania. In 1977 Lakewood did place a single advertisement in both a brochure specifically for the Reading Air Show and one ad in a general aviation journal. However, there was no evidence that either publication was ever circulated in Pennsylvania. The court held that in the absence of a sustained promotional campaign on behalf of Lakewood, such ads in themselves were insufficient to constitute minimum contacts and therefore Lakewood could not be considered to have purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the fact that Lakewood knew the airplane would be returned to Pennsylvania. Id. at 50.\nIn refusing to find minimum contacts, the district court further elaborated the constitutional limits on the \u201ceffects test\u201d of jurisdiction contained in the Pennsylvania Long-Arm Statute and in the A.L.I., Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 37.\nNeither the Restatement nor the Pennsylvania statute, however, is effective if it does not pass constitutional inspection. As Kulko pointed out: \u201cEven in such situations, moreover, the Restatement recognizes that there might be circumstances that would render \u2018unreasonable\u2019 the assertion of jurisdiction over the nonresident defendant.\u201d 436 U.S. at 96, 98 S.Ct. at 1699.\nI take this to mean that if the actual contacts with the forum state are both quantitatively and qualitatively below constitutional demands for fairness, the extrastate act with in-state consequences will not alone sustain jurisdiction. This I think is the case here.\nId. at 50.\nIn De James v. Magnificence Carriers, Inc., 491 F.Supp. 1276 (D.N.J.1980) plaintiff brought suit under federal admiralty jurisdiction to recover for personal injuries suffered while working aboard the vessel M. V. Magnificence Venture. The injuries occurred while the vessel was moored at a pier in Camden, New Jersey.\nHitachi Shipbuilding and Engineering Company Ltd. (Hitachi) entered into a contract in Japan with defendants Magnificence Carriers, Inc., Ventures Shipping and Nippon Yusen Kaisha, the charterers of the vessel, M. V. Magnificence Venture, whereby Hitachi agreed to convert the vessel into an automobile carrier. Plaintiff alleged that the conversion work performed by Hitachi was defective and the direct cause of his injuries.\nHitachi completed all work on the vessel at issue in its Japanese shipyard and had no further contact or involvement with the ship once it left Japan. Moreover, Hitachi did not maintain an office in New Jersey, nor did it have an agent of any type there or transact any business in the state.\nAt issue in De James was whether the presence of a ship in New Jersey upon which the defendant, Hitachi, had performed conversion work in Japan and the occurrence of an injury caused by that work, were sufficient bases upon which to subject Hitachi to suit in New Jersey pursuant to its Long-Arm Statute. Plaintiff argued in support of the exercise of jurisdiction over Hitachi \u201cthat a company which delivers ships into the stream of commerce should reasonably anticipate that its \u2018product\u2019 will touch ports throughout the world and concomitantly, should expect to be haled into court in any forum where a defect in one of its ships causes harm.\u201d Id. at 1279.\nIn rejecting plaintiff\u2019s reliance on Benn v. Linden Crane Co., 326 F.Supp. 995 (E.D.Pa.1971) and distinguishing other \u201cstream of commerce\u201d cases the court stated:\nA close analysis of the \u201cstream of commerce\u201d decisions reveals that the manufacturers or distributors involved in those cases had all made a deliberate decision to market their products in the forum state either directly or indirectly by utilizing an interstate distribution network. While most of the parties involved did not themselves deal with anyone in the forum state, the courts took the position that the companies had placed their products into the forum by virtue of their knowing use of a distributive scheme. In the instant case, by contrast, there was no distributive or marketing scheme whereby Hitachi sought to have the vessel in question marketed and sold through channels to a New Jersey resident. Hitachi\u2019s sole involvement with the vessel was under a contract made in Japan between itself and the ship\u2019s owners under which Hitachi performed certain conversion work on the ship. It had no control over the ship once it left Japan. It made no decision to send the ship into New Jersey, nor did it seek to benefit from the laws of New Jersey or derive any profit there, either directly or indirectly.\nId. at 1280.\nThe court in De James held that Hitachi did not have sufficient minimum contacts with New Jersey in order to render it amenable to jurisdiction pursuant to its Long-Arm Statute.\nIn Kerrigan v. Clarke Gravely Corp., supra, plaintiffs, husband and wife, both Pennsylvania residents, sought to institute suit for personal injuries against a New Jersey partnership (Kenvil) which had repaired a tractor belonging to them. Plaintiffs had taken the tractor to Kenvil in New Jersey and picked it up there once the repairs were performed. Plaintiffs alleged that the wife\u2019s injuries resulted from the negligent repair of the tractor.\nKenvil had no store, representative, agent or distributor in Pennsylvania. It did not advertise nor did any business in Pennsylvania. All of its sales were made in New Jersey. Plaintiffs sought to have the federal diversity court assert jurisdiction over Kenvil under section 8305 of the Pennsylvania Long-Arm Statute. In rejecting the significance of plaintiffs\u2019 argument that it was foreseeable that the tractor would be returned to Pennsylvania and in denying jurisdiction because it violated due process the district court stated:\n. . . [T]his argument overlooks the Supreme Court\u2019s caveat that there are \u201cterritorial limitations on the power of the respective States.\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, supra, 375 U.S. at 251, 78 S.Ct. at 1238. Taken to its logical conclusion, it would subject any non-resident business, which by its nature has interstate ramifications, to the in personam jurisdiction of any state where the business\u2019s product comes to rest and causes injury. Cf. Erlanger Mills v. Cohoes Fibre Mills, 239 F.2d 502, 507 (4th Cir. 1956), Uppgren v. Executive Aviation Services, Inc., 304 F.Supp. 165, 170 (D.Minn.1969); Jack O\u2019Donnell Chevrolet, Inc. v. Shankles, 276 F.Supp. 998 (M.D.Ill.1967). Such a per se rule can produce consequences which offend \u201c \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d Interna tional Shoe Co. v. Washington, supra, 326 U.S. at 316, 66 S.Ct. at 158.\n71 F.R.D. at 486.\nFinally, appellee asserts that the acceptance of a check drawn on a Philadelphia bank, in payment for the hoist, was sufficient to constitute the requisite minimum contacts necessary to satisfy due process.\nIn the instant case, the sale of the hoist from Piracci, Sr. to Alexson was negotiated and consummated in the state of Maryland. Piracci, Sr. invoiced the hoist to Alexson\u2019s Maryland office. Certainly the acceptance of a check, which was merely ancillary to the sale that occurred exclusively in Maryland cannot be said to constitute purposeful activity within Pennsylvania. To accept the reasoning that acceptance of a check drawn on an out-of-state bank is sufficient to constitute minimum contacts with that state is patently absurd. Amenity to suit could be established in any jurisdiction merely on the basis of where the maker of a check decided to maintain a checking account. As the Court stated in Hanson v. Denckla, supra:\nThe unilateral activity of those who claim some relationship with a nonresident defendant cannot satisfy the requirement of contact with the forum State . . . [I]t is essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant purposefully avails [him]self of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State . . . [Emphasis added.] 357 U.S. at 253, 78 S.Ct. at 1239-1240, 2 L.Ed.2d at 1298.\nMoreover, the act of cashing the check was wholly unrelated to the cause of action for personal injuries which arose in Pennsylvania. In order for jurisdiction to attach in this situation, the nonresidents\u2019 activities in the forum state must be \u201cso continuous and substantial as to make it reasonable for the Commonwealth to exercise jurisdiction over [an] admittedly unrelated cause of action.\u201d Bork v. Mills, 458 Pa. 228, 232, 329 A.2d 247, 249 (1974). Piracci, Sr. did not conduct any continuous business activity within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He cannot be said to have purposefully availed himself of the privilege of conducting activities within the Commonwealth nor purposefully availed himself of the benefits of the protection of the laws of Pennsylvania. Hanson v. Denckla, supra. To hold Piracci, Sr. amenable to suit in Pennsylvania on the basis of the receipt of a check drawn on a Philadelphia bank or upon the fortuitous circumstance that the hoist, some eleven months later, found its way into Pennsylvania, would have the effect of appointing the hoist his agent for service of process. His amenability to suit would travel with the hoist. World-Wide Volkswagon, supra.\nWe therefore hold that when an individual seller, not doing business within the Commonwealth, transacts an isolated sale outside the Commonwealth to an unrelated buyer, the causing of a harmful effect in itself, within the Commonwealth or the mere entry of that single product into the stream of commerce within the Commonwealth, in the absence of purposeful participation by the seller in a continuous distributive chain of such product is insufficient to satisfy the minimum contacts requirement of due process and such seller cannot be found amenable to in personam jurisdiction pursuant to Pennsylvania\u2019s Long-Arm Statute. On these facts, Piracci, Sr. cannot be said to have reasonably anticipated being haled into court in Pennsylvania nor be found to have maintained sufficient minimum contacts with this jurisdiction.\nAccordingly, the Orders of the Superior Court are reversed and the Writ of Summons against Piracci, Sr. is dismissed.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nLARSEN and KAUFFMAN, JJ., concurred in the result.\nO\u2019BRIEN, C. J., did not participate in the consideration or decision in this case.\n.
