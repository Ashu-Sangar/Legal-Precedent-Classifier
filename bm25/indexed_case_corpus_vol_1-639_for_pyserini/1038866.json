{"id": "1038866", "contents": "Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court, May 25th 1874.\nPer Curiam.\nThis case is so well stated in the opinion of the court below, it is unnecessary to discuss it. The estate of the widow is land, and not money. When she renounced her provision under the will and took under the law, the Intestate Law superseded the will as to her estate, and excluded the power of conversion under the will, so far as it affected her estate under the Intestate Law.\nJudgment is therefore affirmed."}
