{"id": "466036", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThis is an appeal from an Orphans\u2019 Court decree dismissing a petition for adoption. The mother of the girl child involved refused her consent and appeared in opposition to the petition. The appellant petitioners are an uncle and a paternal aunt with Avhom the child has lived and by whom she has been reared and cared for exclusively since her earliest infancy. The only matter in issue is whether the mother,- Avho is the sole surviving parent, abandoned the child thereby rendering unnecessary her consent to the proposed adoption: see Act of April 4, 1925, P. L. 127, Sec. 2 (c), as amended (1 P.S. \u00a72). The learned trial judge found as a fact and concluded as a matter of law that the abandonment \u201crequired under the provisions of the Act of Assembly\u201d had not been proven; and, the final decree from which the petitioners have appealed was thereupon entered. The question involved is whether the alleged abandonment Avas proven with required legal sufficiency.\nThe appellee urges upon us that under the Pennsylvania Adoption Act, loo. eit. supra, the fact of abandonment, as the alternative of a parent\u2019s consent to an adoption, must be \u201c. . . proven to the satisfaction of the court or judge hearing the petition . . .\u201d and that the trial judge in the instant case \u201cfound there Avas no abandonment\u201d. The conclusion of a trial court in such, regard is reViewable none the less: Weinbaeh\u2019s Appeal, 316 Pa. 333, 336, 175 A. 500. Cf: also Hazuka\u2019s Case-, 345 Pa. 432,435,29 A. 2d 88. While it so happens that in both the Haznka and Weinb\u00e1eh cases, supra, abandonment was proven to tlie satisfaction- of the respective trial courts, our power to review, is no different where the hearing judge, is not satisfied that abandonment was proven. The term \u201csatisfaction\u201d, when used, to specify the degree of persuasion which- a trier, of facts must, experience from the evidence to warrant his niaking a particular finding, has \u201ca clear legal meaning\u201d. The standard of proof so required does not .mean that the fact-finder may \u201cdecide the issue arbitrarily\u201d.: See Toplis & Harding, Inc. v. Murphy, 384 Ill. 463, 5 N.E. 2d 505, 509.\nIt could not have been the legislature\u2019s intention in the Adoption Act to authorize a court or judge hearing a petition to ignore out of hand a conclusion with respect to the proofs of abandonment which the evidence, as accredited by such court or judge, legally warrants and impels. We hold, therefore, that the. requirement; that the fact of abandonment is to be \u201c. . . proven to the satisfaction of the court or judge hearing the petition ...\u201d means that the evidence shall be legally-sufficient to support the finding and that it does not mean that the finding of a trial judge in such connection is. ipso facto binding and conclusive without right to the party aggrieved to appellate review of the court\u2019s action. .It has been held, however, that upon an appeal;-from a final decree or order in an adoption proceeding, the matter!^ befor\u00e9 the reviewing court as on certiorari. In that, situation our examination of the notes of testimony taken on the hearing below is limited to determining, whether there is any evidence to support the findings and . ultimate conclusion of the trial judge: Weinbach\u2019s Appeal, supra, at pp. 336-337.\nThe sustainable findings in this case as amplified and explained by the testimony of witnesses whom; the .trial judge accredited disclose the following factual, situation.\nThe child in controversy was born on March 13,. 1942, in a hospital in Washington, D; C.-, where the mother, a native of\u2019 Scranton, Pennsylvania,, was employed as a typist in a government office. The father, Joseph Davies, who also was from Scranton, was in the military service of the United States. Anticipating the baby\u2019s birth, he obtained a leave and, arriving at the hospital the day following the birth, he visited the mother and-child there.\nOn April 18,1942, when the baby was but five weeks old,- the mother, accompanied- by a woman friend, took the child on an all-night bus trip from- Washington to Scranton to the home of Mrs. Ruth Davies,- Joseph\u2019s mother, with -whom resided her daughter, Esther (Davies) Phillips, and the latter\u2019s husband, Walter P. Phillips, the present appellants.\nWhen the child\u2019s mother and her companion (the latter carrying the baby) entered the Davies home, the companion handed the baby to Mrs. Phillips, the mother saying at the same time, \u201cHere she is, she is yours; I don\u2019t want no part of her.\u201d The mother and her friend remained in the Davies home overnight. The next morning (Sunday), upon being bidden by Mrs.\u25a0 Phillips .to hold the baby after she had bathed it, the mother refused to do so and repeated, \u201cI don\u2019t want no part of her.\u201d It was testified at the hearing, without denial from the mother, that, on the same day she had said that, had it not been for the fact that the father had come to the hospital and had there seen the baby alive, she would have placed it in \u201ca home\u201d and have told him that it was stillborn. The 'court below justifiably found that the respondent \u201c. . . did not deny the statements she was alleged to have made on that occasion\u201d (i.e., the time of the delivery of the baby to the Davies home).\nLate in the-afternoon of the.day last above-mentioned the mother \u201c. . . left the Davies home and her child and resumed her work in Washington, D. C. She visited the child some three or four months later but did not again return for two years.\u201d The fact is that the one time that she saw the child (in what was actually more than two years) was around June 1942 when Joseph Davies was \u25a0on a visit to his mother at her home in Scranton.. During the better than two-year period following that visit, the mother of the child was in Scranton twice, once before going to Atlantic City on vacation and again to attend the funeral of an uncle, but on neither of those occasions did she go to see the child, as she. herself admitted. In the meantime (September 1943) Joseph Davies, the father, was sent overseas in military service.\nIn June of 1944 (the child then being over two years old), Walter Phillips wrote to Mrs. Joseph Davies in Washington offering her the use of his cabin for her vacation. To that invitation she responded by letter which, in material part, reads as follows:\n\u201cJune 22nd [1944]\n\u201cDear Walter,\n\u201cI\u2019ve received your letter in which you so generously offer to arrange for my spending my vacation at your cabin. While I thank you Walter, for all your thoughtfulness, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to have to decline. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m quite ready to spend any time at all with the child yet. I feel nothing but resentment for her and all she stands for. I know you will say that I have absolutely no reason for thinking as I do. . . . However, I still resent her presence. I think the only thing that will make me able to stand her is the feeling Joe has for her and sometimes I even wonder if I think enough of him to make myself put up with something I have absolutely no desire to be with. All this may work itself out in time, I do ask that I have a little time alone with Joe \u2014 a feAV weeks will be adequate \u2014 and try to reach a decision with myself as to how I\u2019m going to manage the rest of my life.\n\u201cI want to thank you and the folks for having so much patience with me. I know that if it were anyone else their patience would have reached an end long ago. I\u2019m afraid there isn\u2019t anything I can do about it though except let things take a natural course and hope that sometime in the near future I get some much needed sense. For the present, though, everything will have to remain as it is.\u201d\nNear tlxe end of October 1944, Mrs. Ruth Davies received a telegram from the War Department notifying her that her son, Joseph, had been killed in action in Germany on- September 29, 1944. Walter Phillips immediately so notified Mrs. Joseph Davies in- Washington by telegram. A few days later (which would be the last of October or the first part of November 1944) she went to Scranton and on that occasion saw the child three times. On one of her visits to the Davies home at that time she brought - with her her mother, Mrs. Mary Casey. Although Mrs. Casey lives in Scranton and has lived there many years, that was the first and only time that she ever saw her daughter\u2019s child up to the time of the hearing in this matter in January 1945.\nAfter a few days in Scranton following the word of her husband\u2019s death, Mrs. Joseph Davies returned to Washington. On December 15, 1944, she- wrote the Phillips a letter, which they received the following day, wherein she asked them to have the child ready for her to take away to another home. Six days later the Phillips initiated the proceeding here involved.\nIn her letter of December 15th to the Phillips, Mrs. Davies enclosed ten dollars to be used in buying a Christmas gift for the child who was then well along in her third year. ' That was the first time the mother had ever sent the child anything. Mrs. Ruth Davies and the Phillips had made many friendly efforts to induce in Mrs. Joseph Davies a more natural feeling for her child but to no avail. In their letters to her, which she put in evidence, they uniformly spoke of the child in loving terms; told glowingly of her progress and development; and, as Mrs. Joseph Davies admitted, they had enclosed pictures of the baby, \u201cmaybe four at a time\u201d, for an estimated total \u201cof 25\u201d. Yet, in her responses, Mrs. Joseph Davies never even- mentioned the child except for her letter of June 22,1944, to Walter Phillips (expressing her bitter resentment of the child) and her letter of December 15, 1944, demanding its return.\nThe Phillips have no children of their own. From the day they received the Davies hahy, they have continuously given it the love, care and training which devoted- and responsible natural parents are accustomed to give, to their children. In all respects, they have treated the child as if it were their own. They have provided it with the medical supervision and attention which an infant or child of tender years requires; they had it baptized in the church of its deceased father; they have furnished it with its food and clothing and have supplied it with its toys and entertainment. In short, they have at all times ministered to the child\u2019s care, comfort and health. From the outset, they assumed to exercise and, ever since, have faithfully discharged the responsibility of parents to the child who has known no other parent.\nThe respondent expressly admitted at the hearing that the Phillips are law-abiding citizens; that they bear a good reputation; that they \u201care able to provide a proper home\u201d for the child; that they \u201care able to care for, support, maintain and educate her in a manner conducive to her welfare\u201d; and that they \u201cwill perform all the duties of parents toward her.\u201d In connection with the petitioners\u2019 averred belief that the child\u2019s welfare would be promoted by the proposed adoption, the respondent also expressly admitted, as supporting such belief, the fact that the child, if adopted, would thereby be \u201cassured of a good home and education and the proper rearing and treatment necessary for her welfare.\u201d\nThe respondent\u2019s case consisted entirely of her objection to the adoption; her subjective testimony that she had had a change of \u201cattitude\u201d toward the child since her husband\u2019s death; that she had established a bank account to the joint credit of herself and her mother, Mrs. Casey, wherein was deposited \u201cthe proceeds of the United States Government allotment made to her as the wife of Joseph Davies\u201d; and that, out of her government allotment of fifty dollars a month, she had sent, beginning in January 1944, \u201c$20.00 [a month] for the support of the child\u201d up to September 1944. The petitioners admitted that during the period last mentioned Mrs.'Joseph Davies had enclosed money in letters to members of the Davies household, sometimes a twenty and sometimes a ten dollar bill, for an estimated total of sixty dollars. But, as the letters made no mention of the child, it had been assumed by Mrs. Ruth Davies and the Phillips that the money was being sent to Mrs. Ruth Davies at the instance of her son, Joseph, on account of what she had given him in the past. The trial court made no specific finding in this connection, merely reciting that the respondent had said \u201cthat she . . . sent twenty dollars a month to Mrs. Phillips for the child. . . .\u201d Treating that recital most favorably to the respondent, it can mean no more than the most that she testified to, viz., that from January 1944 to September 1944 she had sent twenty dollars a month, for a total of one hundred and sixty dollars, for the support of the child.\nWhat the change of \u201cattitude\u201d was, that the respondent experienced toward the child, she did not say. It is certain, however, that she neither expressed nor evinced any desire or intention to assume responsibility for the child\u2019s care and training. She testified that under \u201cthe arrangements\u201d she had in mind for the child \u201cShe is to stay with my mother, [in Scranton]. . . . While my mother [Mrs. Casey] is physically able to care for the child with the aid of my sister, I will keep my job [in Washington].\u201d As will be recalled, the child was in Scranton two and a half years before Mrs. Casey went to see it.\nThere was no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s ultimate conclusion that abandonment had not been proven in this case. Our courts have not hesitated to find abandonment from circumstances not as conclusive in relevant regard as were here shown nor have they refrained from raising the disqualification to consent against an offending parent even though such parent was the mother: cf. Hazuka\u2019s Case, supra; Weinbach\u2019s Appeal, supra; In Re: Adoption of Elizabeth McCann, 104 Pa. Superior Ct. 196, 159 A. 334; In Re Adoption of Shirley Jane Curry, 15 Lehigh County Law Journal 354; Adoption of Dorothy H. Moul, 50 York Legal Record 205; Adoption of Pauline Fay Ogurcalc, 35 Berks County Law Journal 127; In re Adoption of Walter Malek, 34 Berks County Law Journal 7; Adoption of Lee Clark, a Minor, 37 Luzerne Legal Register Reports 329. The facts of the case last, cited are strikingly similar to the present. The hearing judge in that case had no difficulty in finding that the abandonment was proven to his satisfaction. Nor did the paper which that mother had signed, upon giving up her child, operate as a binding waiver of her rights to the .child. The mother at the time of sign-, ing it was not of legal age. It was but a piece of evidence of her intent to abandon. .\nAbandonment is not an ambulatory thing the legal effects of which a delinquent parent may dissipate at will by the expression of a desire for the return'of the discarded child. We do not mean to say that the natural parental right to a child,- which has been nullified by abandonment, may not later be retrieved. It may be. But, as the parent\u2019s consent to an adoption is no longer necessary, once abandonment, has been proven with required legal sufficiency, the welfare of the abandoned child is the primary and paramount concern of the court unaffected by the desire or caprice of the abandoning parent.\nWhen, then, does abandonment become complete? That is a question of fact to be determined from the evidence. It requires an intent to escape parental responsibility, and conduct in effectuation of such intent : see Hazuka\u2019s Case, supra. However, the inexorable circumstances of. a child that has been abandoned may soon render the abandonment effectual. That is necessarily so. A child\u2019s natural needs for food, clothing and shelter demand that someone immediately assume the attendant responsibility which an abandoning parent has ignored; and, that responsibility endures constantly. It does not await the capricious decision of an uncertain parent, perhaps; years later. The longer the responsibility continues to be discharged capably by the foster parentj th\u00e9 stronger become the ties that form out of the new relationship until there comes a time \u2014 possibly, not long deferred, \u2014 when the welfare of the child may' justly require that the parental responsibility be allowed to remain where the abandoning parent has willingly permitted it to be.\nIn Weinbach's Appeal, supra, we quoted at length (pp. 339-340) from Winans v. Luppie, 47 N. J. Eq. 302, 304, 20 A. 969, \u201cas indicating the wise view of cases of this class\u201d. The pertinency of the law, as there stated, to the findings and undisputed evidence of the instant case justify our quoting again, but more briefly, from the same source as follows: \u201cIt [i.e., abandonment] fairly may, and in o\u00fcr judgment does, import any conduct on the part of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claim to the child. ... - when once the abandonment is - shown to have existed, it becomes a judicial question whether it really has been terminated or can b\u00e9; consistently with the. welfare' of the child. When, in pursuance perhaps of the abandonment, new -ties have been formed and a new station in life has been taken by the child, it might be unjust that, solely because of the parents\u2019 caprice, legal sanction should be refused to the new conditions.\u201d The emotional disturbance to- a child that would threaten from its being removed summarily and permanently from familiar and agreeable surroundings and associations, incident to- the only parental control and supervision it has \u2019 ever known, could have a very harmful effect on the \u25a0 child\u2019s whole life. Fortunately^ the' law?s regard for- a child\u2019s welfare does not admit of any such injury or harm being done it.\nThe overwhelming proofs in this case are that the mother abandoned the child on April 18, 1942. And, from that day down to December 15, 1944, her every word and act was in effectuation of an. intent to render her separation from the child as. complete as possible. That she succeeded admits of no doubt. - In furtherance of her undenied declarations of such a desire and intent, there was but her one visit to the child when it was three or four months old and then not another for. more than two years although she was in Scranton twice during that period with time Available to see the child had she cared to do so. And, throughout th\u00e9 sam\u00e9 relatively long period she made no inquiry concerning the child; she sent it no gift, no bit of.clothing; no toy, not even a card of greeting to evidence a thought for the child. Her letter of June 22,- 1944, to Walter Phillips (more than two years after she had deliberately given up the child\u2019s care and custody) not only plainly stated a continued dislike of the child but clearly indicated that,' even then, she had. neither a desire to assume parental responsibility nor thought of* changing the child\u2019s situation. Certainly, the child\u2019s welfare was not to be subject to the precariousness of a later asserted change of mind on the mother\u2019s part. So far as human, efforts enter into the circumstance of continued life and health, the fact that the child has lived and has thriven since April 18, 1942, is not due to any care or attention given it by its mother. She has never yet evinced- the least desire to assume responsibility .for the child\u2019s care and training: Nor, in so saying, do we disregard her temporary pecuniary contribution to the child\u2019s support. That was belated and relatively small. In any event \u201cThe statutory notion of abandonment\u201d does not require that the parent cease to feel any concern for the child\u2019s interests: Winans v. Luppie, supra. Incidentally, in all of the cases cited, supra, where adoption was awarded over the objections of abandoning mothers,.each of the latter had sought, by her objection, to reassume parental responsibility and not merely to obtain control of; the child in order to hand it over to .someone else.\nThere is no merit and certainly no pertinency in the appellee\u2019s contention that, inasmuch as the father was alive when the mother deposited the child with the Phillips, there could have been no abandonment. Parenthetically, it may be noted that there is testimony in the record, elicited by the respondent\u2019s cross-examination of Walter Phillips, to the effect that the father, cognizant of the mother\u2019s abandonment of the child, fully realized the situation and that he, before going overseas, had solicited the Phillips to adopt the child which, out of a regard for the father\u2019s love for the child and his rights with respect to it, they were reluctant to do while he was necessarily separated from the child. But, however, that may be, the question here involved is whether the mother abandoned the child. As the surviving parent, it was only Tier consent to the adoption that was necessary or, failing that, proper proof that she had abandoned the child. An abandoning parent- can claim no right to control or determine the destiny of a child on the ground that the other parent had remained faithful to it.\nThe trial judge erred in concluding that the \u00a1 abandonment alleged in this case had not been proven. It was established with required legal sufficiency. The provision in the statute that the proofs be \u201cto the satisfaction of the court or judge hearing the petition\u201d was therefore met. Consequently, the mother\u2019s consent to the adoption was unnecessary. It also, clearly appears that the child\u2019s welfare will best be served and promoted by her being continued under the parental authority, control and responsibility of the petitioners. Their qualifications to act as the child\u2019s legal parents were not only competently established but are unquestioned. It was therefore error for the trial court to dismiss the petition. .\nThe decree of the court below is reversed, at the appellee\u2019s costs, with directions that a decree of adoption be entered as prayed for."}
