State Ethics Commission, 503 Pa. 358, 469 A.2d 593 (1983), and In Re Nomination Petitions of Owen, 922 A.2d 973 (Pa.Cmwlth.2007).\nIt is further ordered that David Howells, Jr., is to remain on both the Republican and Democratic ballots as a candidate for the office of Magisterial District Judge for District 31-1-04.
