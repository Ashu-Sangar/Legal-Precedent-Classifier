The issue, as stated by petitioner, is:\nDid the Superior Court override controlling authority establishing that in a joint trial, where the Commonwealth properly redacted a co-defendant\u2019s statement and did not use it to directly establish defendant\u2019s guilt, and where the trial court properly instructed the jury regarding that statement, the narrow exception to the presumption that a jury will follow its instructions established in Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), does not apply?"}
