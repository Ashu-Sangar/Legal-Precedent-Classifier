{"id": "1915718", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThis appeal presents a narrow question: does a judgment entered in a trespass action brought in the name of the plaintiff, for both his benefit and that of his subrogated insurance carrier, to recover property damages resulting from an automobile accident, bar a later trespass action between the same parties for personal injuries suffered by the plaintiff in the same accident?\nOn May 12, 1966, an automobile, owned by Samuel Schlessinger and operated by Earl Maxwell, collided with another automobile, owned and operated by Joseph Spinelli, and, as a result, allegedly, Spinelli suffered not only damage to his automobile but also injuries to his person.\nThe damage to Spinelli\u2019s automobile amount to $1300; of that amount Spinelli\u2019s insurance carrier, Calvert Fire Insurance Company, paid Spinelli $1200, the difference between the $1300 damage and the $100 deductible provision in the insurance policy. Upon receipt of payment, Spinelli executed a subrogation receipt and signed the following request: \u201cThe undersigned, having suffered a property loss of $100.00 in excess of the $1200.00 named in the foregoing subrogation receipt, does hereby request the said insurance company to employ counsel for and on his behalf, to effect recovery thereof, only, however, in the event that said insurance company employs counsel on its own behalf. It being herein agreed, that, in event of recovery the net proceeds thereof (after payment of costs and Attorneys\u2019 fees) shall be apportioned between the undersigned and the said insurance company as the interest of each herein appears.\u201d\nOn October 6, 1966, a trespass action was instituted in the name of Spinelli against Schlessinger and Maxwell in the County Court of Philadelphia County and in that action Spinelli asserted a claim against Schlessinger and Maxwell only for the $1300 damage to his automobile. Approximately seven months later, an arbitration panel made an award in favor of Spinelli and against Schlessinger and Maxwell in the amount of $1300 and, upon payment of this award, a judgment was entered of record on May 31, 1967 in favor of Spinelli and against Schlessinger and Maxwell and then marked satisfied.\nOn April 4, 1967, Spinelli instituted the instant trespass action against Schlessinger and Maxwell in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County wherein Spinelli claimed damages only for his personal injuries. In answer to Spinelli\u2019s complaint, Schlessinger and Maxwell, under new matter, recited the record facts of the prior trespass action and then moved for judgment on the pleadings. Judge Bernard J. Kelley of the court below entered a judgment for Schlessinger and Maxwell. From that judgment the present appeal was taken.\nWhen personal injuries to a person and damages to his property arise from the same cause and the same tortious act, the person who has sustained such personal injuries and property damage must seek recovery for both in a single action and, if separate actions are instituted for each category of damage and a judgment is rendered in one of such actions, the entry of such judgment has the effect of res judicata and bars recovery in the other action. Such is the view of a substantial majority of jurisdictions in the United States, and to this view Pennsylvania has long adhered. See: Fields v. P.R.T. Co., 273 Pa. 282, 117 A. 59 (1922); Fisher v. Hill, 368 Pa. 53, 81 A. 2d 860 (1951); Saber v. Supplee-Wills-Jones Milk Co., 181 Pa. Superior Ct. 167, 124 A. 2d 620 (1956).\nBasically, the question turns on whether there is only one cause of action or more than one cause of action. In Fields v. P.R.T. Co., supra, this Court took the position that: . . If the cause of action is a wrongful act, and we so hold, then all of the damages sustained thereby, whether to person or property, are properly sought in one suit . . . .\u201d (p. 286). (Emphasis added). The views expressed in Fields are sound and have long represented the law in this Commonwealth and to the ruling in Fields we continue to adhere.\nThe Fields ruling is salutary: (a) it relieves defendants of subjection to more than one suit by the same person for a single tort; (b) it avoids a multiplicity of suits; (c) it provides a simple and direct method of determining all the claims of an individual arising from the same tortious act.\nIn the case at bar, Spinelli\u2019s counsel, recognizing, but not conceding the soundness of, the rule enunciated in Fields, takes the position that the Fields rule should be subjected to an exception so as not to bar recovery in the present action. Non-application of the Fields rule is urged in the case at bar because: (a) the County Court action for property damage was brought for the benefit of Spinelli\u2019s insurance carrier and that it was such carrier and not Spinelli who was the real party in interest in that action; (b) the execution by Spinelli of a \u201csubrogation receipt\u201d rather than a \u201cloan receipt\u201d, when he was paid $1200 by his insurance carrier, reaffirms Spinelli\u2019s contention that it was the insurance carrier, not Spinelli, who was \"the actual party in the County Court action; (c) at all times Sehlessinger, Maxwell and their insurance carrier knew that the County Court action was based upon a claim to which Spinelli\u2019s collision carrier was subrogated.\nIt must be noted, even at the sake of repetition, that the amount claimed (and recovered) in the County Court action was $1300 an amount which included $1200 paid to Spinelli by his carrier and the $100 deductible amount which represented Spinelli\u2019s uncompensated property damage. Thus, the amount sought and the amount eventually paid covered not only the loss of the insurance carrier but also Spinelli\u2019s own loss.\nSaber v. Supplee-Wills-Jones Milk Co., supra, effectively answers the first two contentions of Spinelli, i.e., as to the insurance carrier being the real party in interest and the \u201csubrogation receipt\u201d. In Saber, Saber had received from his insurance carrier payment for the property damage to his motor vehicle, less a $50 deductible amount and had executed a \u201cloan receipt\u201d upon payment to him by his carrier. Saber first instituted a suit for his personal injuries and in that action recovered a judgment. His insurance carrier later brought suit in Saber\u2019s name for the amount of the property damage including the $50 deductible loss not paid by the carrier. The trial court granted a motion for judgment on the pleadings on the ground that the judgment in the prior suit barred recovery in the second action and from the entry of such judgment Saber appealed. In affirming the entry of such judgment, the Superior Court held that the rule prohibiting the splitting of a cause of action was unaffected by the presence of the insurance carrier in the action as a \u201csubrogee\u201d. The distinction which Spinelli\u2019s counsel seeks to draw between Saber and the case at bar to the effect that Saber was under a \u201cloan receipt\u201d rather than a \u201csubrogation receipt\u201d was considered by the Superior Court and rejected. A reading of Saber clearly reveals that it was not only argued but determined by the Court upon the theory of a subrogation in fact and not upon the theory of a \u201cloan receipt\u201d. See also: Frantz Tractor Co. v. Providence Washington Insurance Co., 383 Pa. 542, 545, 119 A. 2d 495 (1956). That Maxwell, Schlessinger and their carrier knew Spinelli\u2019s carrier was a subrogee in the first action does not render the Fields rule inapplicable.\nWe believe it to be sound policy to avoid subjecting a person to a multiplicity of lawsuits by splitting up a single claim arising from the same tortious act because of the difference in the damage sustained. We see no reason, in the factual posture of this litigation, to make an exception to the well-settled rule in this Commonwealth.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents.\nSee' 62 A.L.R. 2d pp. 982-989, inc. As to the minority jurisdictions, see: 62 A.L.R. 2d pp. 1001-1008, inc.\nCf. Sustrik v. J. & L. Steel Corp., 413 Pa. 324, 327, 328, 197 A. 2d 44 (1964); London v. Philadelphia, 412 Pa. 496, 500, 194 A. 2d 901 (1963).\nPrior to the ruling in Fields, it was customary to include in one action claims for property damage and personal injuries inflicted at the same time. See: Standard Pennsylvania Practice, vol. 3, \u00a763 and footnote, p. 73.\nSome jurisdictions which follow the majority rule recognize an exception where one element of the injured party\u2019s damage is the subject of insurance. See: 62 A.L.B. 2d 977, \u00a75(b), pp. 989-995, inc.\nAs appellees\u2019 brief indicates, the practice of using \u201cloan receipts\u201d antedated the promulgation of Pa. R.C.P. 2002(d) which now allows a subrogee to sue in the subrogor\u2019s name.\nSpinelli not only signed the \u201csubrogation receipt\u201d but expressly requested and authorized his insurance carrier to employ counsel for him in the county court action."}
