{"id": "1827691", "contents": "OPINION\nCAPPY, Justice.\nThe issue before this Court is whether trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object, during closing argument, to the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of appellant as a liar. We find that this claim of ineffectiveness is without merit and, therefore, affirm the order of the Superior Court. 382 Pa.Super. 643, 549 A.2d 1340.\nFollowing a trial by jury, appellant was convicted of rape and criminal conspiracy. Trial counsel filed timely post-verdict motions, however, prior to any ruling thereon, appellant filed a pro se motion alleging ineffective assistance of counsel. Trial counsel was granted leave to withdraw and new counsel was appointed who filed supplemental post-verdict motions which included claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. An evidentiary hearing was held, following which the trial court denied the post-verdict motions and imposed a total sentence of eight to sixteen years incarceration. The Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. This appeal by allowance followed.\nAppellant and the victim essentially agree on the following preliminary facts surrounding the incident: On June 19, 1982, the victim, who was then sixteen years old, left her home to meet Lena Goode with whom she planned to attend a neighborhood party. On their way to the party, the two girls met appellant, his brother, Wayne, and appellant\u2019s friend, Rick Ellis and invited them to attend the party. The five proceeded to the party together, spent the majority of the time with one another while at the party and left the party together. After leaving the party, appellant drove the group to a lounge where they stayed until approximately 2:00 a.m. Appellant next drove the group to North Philadelphia. It was the victim\u2019s testimony that appellant intentionally passed by the street where she lived because he wanted to take his brother Wayne home first. However, a few minutes later appellant stopped the van at 24th and Berks Street whereupon Lena Goode and appellant exited the van, ostensibly to go to the restroom. The victim, Mr. Ellis and Wayne remained in the van. It is at this point that appellant\u2019s version and that of the victim diverge significantly.\nThe victim testified that when Lena and appellant failed to return in a few minutes, she and Rick left the van to look for them. They entered a nearby house, which was later determined to be appellant\u2019s residence, where they encountered appellant who directed them to a bedroom on the second floor where he claimed they would find Lena. The victim testified that upon entering the bedroom, appellant pushed her onto a mattress and raped her while Rick Ellis stood there pointing a gun at her demanding that she let appellant do as he wished. When appellant finished, Rick Ellis also raped her.\nWhile Rick was raping her, the victim heard Lena call her name, whereupon appellant ran from the room and Rick got off of her, told her to dress, and threatened her if she told anyone about what had just occurred. After leaving the house, she saw Lena and appellant approaching her but was unable to tell Lena what had occurred because she was crying and having trouble breathing, apparently due to a pre-existing asthma condition.\nThe five of them then got back into the van and drove away, but within a few minutes, Rick Ellis announced that he wanted out of the van because he was annoyed at the victim\u2019s hysterical behavior. Appellant then stopped at a restaurant, at Lena\u2019s request, to get some tissues for the victim.\nAfter appellant exited the van, the victim saw her stepbrother across the street and she and Lena ran to him. She was still unable to communicate what exactly had occurred at the house, but, did manage to tell him that it had something to do with the people in the van. Upon seeing the girls talking and pointing in his direction, appellant took off in the van. The step-brother summoned a taxi for the two girls after the victim refused his offer to take them to the police. However, upon seeing the victim\u2019s state, the cab driver stopped a police officer who was passing by, who then took the victim to a hospital.\nAppellant, on the other hand, denied having any sexual contact with the victim. Rather, he maintained that he and Lena had gone into his house and engaged in consensual sex while the others remained in the van. He testified that when he and Lena returned to the van, the victim and Rick were not there so he and Lena retraced their steps to look for them. Thereafter, they saw the victim and Rick walking towards them from a nearby housing project. The victim asked appellant if she could use his bathroom and both she and Rick went into appellant\u2019s house. According to appellant\u2019s testimony, nothing remarkable happened while the victim was in his presence except that she was noticeably upset as they were driving to the restaurant.\nDuring closing argument, the prosecutor first summarized the testimony of each of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. He then addressed appellant\u2019s testimony, concluding that it did not fit with the other evidence presented and repeatedly stated that appellant had lied. Appellant argues that, in making these comments, the prosecutor improperly expressed his personal belief as to appellant\u2019s credibility and that, therefore, trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to that portion of the Commonwealth\u2019s closing.\nIn reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we must first determine whether the issue underlying the claim has arguable merit. Commonwealth v. Evans, 489 Pa. 85, 413 A.2d 1025 (1980). If the claim lacks merit, our inquiry ceases, as counsel will not be deemed ineffective for failing to pursue a baseless or meritless issue. Commonwealth v. Nelson, 514 Pa. 262, 523 A.2d 728 (1987). If, however, the claim has merit, we must then determine whether the course of action chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests. Commonwealth v. Hentosh, 520 Pa. 325, 554 A.2d 20 (1989). Finally, appellant must show that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness so prejudiced his case that he was denied a fair trial. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987).\nIt is well settled that a prosecutor is not permitted to express a personal belief as to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence or as to the defendant\u2019s or other witness\u2019 credibility. Commonwealth v. Carpenter, 511 Pa. 429, 515 A.2d 531 (1987). In Commonwealth v. Bricker, 506 Pa. 571, 487 A.2d 346 (1985), we held that it was reversible error for the prosecutor to state, during cross-examination of a defense witness, that the witness \u201clied.\u201d However, in Bricker there was no basis whatsoever for the prosecutor\u2019s remarks. In other words, the evidence presented in that case did not support an inference that the witnesses had lied. Similarly, in Commonwealth v. Harvey, 514 Pa. 531, 526 A.2d 330 (1987) which was a non-jury case, we noted that had the case been tried by a jury, the prosecutor\u2019s remarks, both during cross-examination of the defendant and in the course of his closing argument, would have constituted reversible error since the remarks were completely unsupported by the record.\nHere, the prosecutor\u2019s comments that appellant had lied were given in response to defense counsel\u2019s comments regarding the credibility of the victim and were supported by the evidence. During closing argument, defense counsel stated as follows:\nNow, what type of facts did you hear in this case?\nYou heard two conflicting stories.\nSo how are you going to determine who\u2019s telling the truth?\nWell, it\u2019s tough because when a person\u2019s on that witness stand and telling a lie, a bell doesn\u2019t go off to let you know they\u2019re lying. Just the same as when they\u2019re telling the truth, the light doesn\u2019t come out and shine upon them, so how do you determine whether someone\u2019s telling the truth or telling a lie?\nYou have to use your common sense. You take your everyday experiences, and that\u2019s why you were selected as jurors, because you have common sense, everyday experiences, and how to judge the witnesses.\nNow, take your everyday experiences, and let\u2019s see how Deirdre Hayes testified in this case. She got on that witness stand and she was shaking. She was upset.\nUse your experience. Think back, when you\u2019re trying to deceive somebody and you\u2019re being confronted with them one on one, how you feel that knot in the pit of your stomach and how it grows, and how you shake, and how you feel nauseated, and then also think of how when you have to go up on that witness stand and take an oath to tell the truth before God, and you\u2019re testifying before God, and you\u2019re testifying before a Judge such as Judge Clarke and 14 people, two attorneys, and the person that you\u2019re telling that lie about.\nHow are you going to feel? How would you react?\nIsn\u2019t that also consistent with the way Miss Hayes acted on that witness stand? Isn\u2019t that also consistent?\nYou saw Miss Hayes. You saw her testify. Do you think she acted that way when she was meeting the young men?\nUse your common sense. Think about it when you\u2019re going through and reviewing the testimony.\nNow, I\u2019m not going to review all of the testimony with you. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to review it all or even proper because just last week is when you heard the case. It\u2019s just two days, so most of the evidence is still fresh in your mind, but there are a few facts and a few gaps, and a few failures to ring of truth, as Mr. McGettigan told you, a ring of truths that are problems with Miss Hayes\u2019 testimony.\nIn response, the prosecutor first reviewed the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and then made the following comments:\nI submit to you that Mr. Wilkins is truthful and the defendant lied, and he lied to you from beginning to end of his testimony.\nHe lied to you when he said he was in Philadelphia all the time after this event.\nHe lied to you when he said he was driving towards the Germantown area with Wayne and Lena and Deirdre just because he thought that would be a good idea, and what did he tell you from that witness stand?\nHe told you that Wayne was concerned, I was concerned, Deirdre was hysterical, and her friend got hungry so we went to get something to eat.\nThat\u2019s what he told you: I was concerned.\nWas he concerned when he wrote this letter? He was concerned. He was very concerned when he came out of that Steak and Eggs and he saw Deirdre talking to her brother, and his concern, I submit to you, was the same concern that he had throughout that entire night, concern with himself, and as he testified: I didn\u2019t know what she was telling her brother.\nI submit to you he knew what she was telling her brother. She was telling her brother of what he had done, but he didn\u2019t want to get involved.\nHis concern apparently for Deirdre Hayes ended then, and he\u2019s gone.\nAnd he testified then he went to Mount Holly and he\u2014 or he took Sylvia, and he went back to 1932 North 24th Street, but that was later, and he said it wasn\u2019t his face in that window.\nHe says that Officer Keenan\u2019s wrong and Officer Merritt\u2019s wrong, and Deirdre Hayes is wrong, and her mother is wrong, and it wasn\u2019t his face, but he doesn\u2019t tell you\u2014 he doesn\u2019t know whose face it was in his house with Sylvia, the mother of his children, doesn\u2019t know.\nNot my face, he says. That\u2019s what the defendant tells you.\nFor you to believe that, you have to believe that Officer Merritt\u2019s lying, Deirdre Hayes is lying, Officer Keenan\u2019s lying, and Mrs. Harris lying; Mrs. Harris, who I submit to you, testified with the candor and truthfulness of a mother of a victim.\nThat\u2019s some of the testimony of the defendant\u2019s that you\u2019re going to have to weigh and judge the truthfulness and credibility of.\nBut there\u2019s so much more of the defendant\u2019s testimony; his testimony as to having what he called an affair, and if I recall his response to my question, \u201cHow long did this last,\u201d well, he used the word \u201cordeal.\u201d He said, \u201cThis ordeal lasted about a half an hour.\u201d\nWell, I submit to you that\u2019s a slip of the tongue. He\u2019s not talking about his ordeal. He\u2019s talking about Deirdre Hayes\u2019 ordeal, or else he has a strange word for an affair which is a strange word for what he did, and I submit to you that what he did was a violent, criminal act that\u2019s called sex only in the broadest terms, broadest definitions, and it\u2019s violent.\nBut the defendant testified that he didn\u2019t know anything about this; he had an idea the police were after him, and he testified: That they didn\u2019t have no warrant or nothing so I wasn\u2019t looking for them.\nAnd I submit to you then he fled. He fled this jurisdiction because he knew. He knew what he was wanted for and why he was wanted, and knew what would happen to him when he was caught because he wasn\u2019t seen again until Officer Merritt arrested him on the 24th of April of 1984.\nAnd he never quit his job. He just abandoned the van and his job and his check and his house, and the mother of his children, and his children, and he fled the jurisdiction. And he fled because of what he did.\nAnd he sat there before you and testified under oath, under oath, moments before another witness would come in and say: That\u2019s a lie, and he drew you a map. He drew you a map to demonstrate how this couldn\u2019t happen and that couldn\u2019t happen, and he did that right after she told you what did happen.\nI don\u2019t have that much more to say. This is not testimony. I can\u2019t add or detract from what any of the witnesses said by testimony.\nI certainly can\u2019t add to or detract to what Deirdre told you. If the words existed for Deirdre to say to make this event not have occurred, I submit to you she would have said them.\nIf her mother knew the words that she could say that would make this event not have occurred, would her mother say them? If I knew the words that would make this event not have occurred, would I be a human being if I did not say the words that would make that rape of Deirdre Hayes not have occurred?\nBut the facts are the facts. The testimony demonstrates she was raped and he did it and stood up here, and I submit to you he gave you lie after lie after lie, and he had an answer for everything.\nBut when you look, even the most superficial response of the defendant, you see lie, you see lie, you see lie.\nWhile the prosecutor did state during his closing argument that appellant had lied, when taken in context and after review of all of the evidence, it becomes clear that his remarks were neither unfair nor prejudicial. Clearly, the outcome in this case involved a credibility determination by the jury. The victim and appellant were the only two who testified regarding the events of that evening despite the fact that there were three other people present during most of the evening. The jury was acutely aware that the victim\u2019s and appellant\u2019s stories conflicted. Even the trial judge, during a side bar conference, commented that the case would rest on a credibility determination between appellant and the victim. Moreover, it was defendant\u2019s counsel who first commented on the credibility of the witnesses. Indeed, defense counsel quite clearly indicated his belief that one of the prosecution witnesses was in fact lying. The prosecutor then responded to this attack on one of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. Given these circumstances, it would be difficult to conceive of any other approach when closing to the jury than that employed by the prosecutor here. Viewed in this context, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were neither unfair nor prejudicial, but, merely reinforced the fact that the jury had been presented conflicting stories. Because appellant\u2019s claim lacks merit, we cannot find counsel ineffective for failing to object to these remarks. See, Commonwealth v. D\u2019Amato, 514 Pa. 471, 526 A.2d 300 (1987).\nThe Superior Court found that the remarks were not improper nor prejudicial noting that the prosecutor, in arguing to the jury that appellant\u2019s version of the facts was untrue, employed the terms \u201cI submit.\u201d While this Court agrees that the comments made in the instant case were not prejudicial given the atmosphere of the entire trial, we do not today hold that the mere use of the terms \u201cI submit\u201d necessarily cures an otherwise prejudicial remark. To reiterate, we conclude only that because of the unusual circumstances presented in the instant case, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were neither unfair nor prejudicial. In so holding, we do not wish to sanction the use of the terms, \u201cyou lied.\u201d A prosecutor must act properly during the entire trial. His or her conduct during trial should neither be vindictive nor should he or she attempt in any manner whatsoever to influence the jury by arousing their prejudices.\nAccordingly, we affirm the Order of the Superior Court.\nMcDERMOTT, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3121.\n. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 903."}
