{"id": "1941717", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThis appeal requires that we consider the value of a prosecutrix\u2019s recantation subsequent to trial, when her testimony at trial was the sole evidence upon which the Commonwealth depended to support the indictments against appellant for various sex crimes. We believe that on the record before us a new trial is necessary so that a new jury may pass on the prosecutrix\u2019s credibility in light of subsequent events.\nAppellant was convicted of incest, statutory rape, and corrupting the morals of a minor in a trial before a jury on June 12 and 13, 1968. The Commonwealth\u2019s case rested entirely upon the testimony of Frieda Hos-teller, appellant\u2019s fifteen year old daughter. Under oath at trial, she recounted how on the afternoon of January 23, 1968, her father entered the bathroom where she was bathing and \u201cstarted playing with my busts.\u201d According to Frieda, her father then told her to come visit him nude in his bedroom, which she did. She lay on the bed on her back, and her father allegedly had intercourse with her. She testified she was penetrated for approximately five minutes; she experienced no pain, and no emission occurred.\nFrieda stated she then dressed and went downstairs while her father went to sleep. When her sister returned from school some fifteen minutes later, Frieda told her of the alleged incident. The story was repeated to her mother shortly thereafter.\nThe following day, Frieda was called for at school by her step-brother and his wife, who had heard of Frieda\u2019s accusation. They took the girl to the Easton police, who in turn had her examined at the hospital.\nDr. Linwood Pearson, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology, appeared as a witness on behalf of the Commonwealth. He testified that his examination of Frieda on January 24, 1968 in the emergency ward at the Easton Hospital disclosed no evidence of perineal or labial laceration; her hymen was intact and uninjured. A vaginal cotton swab test and a rectal examination were also negative.\nMrs. Mosteller, Frieda\u2019s mother, testified for the defense. She stated that after she had been informed of what had allegedly occurred, she took Frieda into the bathroom and examined her, at which time \u201cI seen everything normal.\u201d She also stated that when she returned home, Frieda was sitting downstairs and in no way appeared disturbed or upset.\nAppellant himself took the stand and strenuously denied having done any of the acts attributed to him by his daughter. He admitted being home alone with Frieda but asserted he had been asleep the entire time.\nFollowing his conviction, appellant submitted motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment, which were argued on March 4, 1969. In his argument, appellant abandoned the original grounds for his written motion of June 17, 1968, contending instead that he was entitled to a new trial because of after-discovered evidence taken on June 28,1968, in the form of a sworn statement made by Frieda and later testimony of Mrs. Mabel Yulcano, Frieda\u2019s great aunt at a court hearing.\nFrieda had returned to live with her parents shortly after the alleged incident occurred in January, 1968. She remained at home until May 1, 1968, when she was adjudged a dependent child by the Juvenile Court of Northampton County. Protective service was ordered for her through the Northampton County Children\u2019s Bureau, and she was instructed to live with her maternal grandmother, with whom she stayed until June 25, 1968 (thirteen days after the verdict). Frieda then voluntarily returned home. Two days later her sister telephoned their father\u2019s attorney and informed him that Frieda wished to retract her trial testimony.\nFrieda was examined by the district attorney in the presence of defense counsel and a representative of the Children\u2019s Bureau on June 28, 1968. She stated under oath that her testimony at trial had been untrue, and stressed, \u201c. . . [h]e did not do it, and I don\u2019t want to see him go to jail for something he didn\u2019t do, and I want to be home with my parents.\u201d Her explanation for her earlier falsehoods was, \u201c. . . [b] ecause people was telling me to do one thing and other people were telling me to do another thing, and I was so mixed up I didn\u2019t know what to say.\u201d According to Frieda, her grandmother and her uncle had pushed her into testifying at trial. She had merely told her sister that \u201cmy father got after me,\u201d and her sister then relayed this information to their mother. She was scared to tell the truth at trial because her \u201c. . . grandmother and them was in court, and if I turned around and told the other story, that he didn\u2019t touch me, then I didn\u2019t know what they would think.\u201d\nFrieda continued by persistently denying every aspect and detail of her previous trial testimony despite numerous warnings from the district attorney that she was in effect admitting the crime of perjury, which, it was explained to her, carried a penalty \u201cof up to |3,000 fine and up to seven years in jail.\u201d Frieda did not waiver in her recantation.\nA hearing was held before the court on February 3, 1969, at which time Mrs. Mabel Vulcano, Frieda\u2019s great aunt, testified that on May 14, 1968, (approximately one month prior to appellant\u2019s trial) she had asked Frieda if her father had actually done anything at all to her, and Frieda replied in the negative. Mrs. Vulcano explained that she had not made this fact known previously because her brother had instructed her to remain quiet. Frieda did not testify at this hearing.\nThe court en banc concluded that a new trial was not warranted under the circumstances. The Superior Court affirmed per curiam without opinion on March 19, 1970, with Judge Hoffman filing a dissenting opinion. We granted allocatur.\nThis Court has often reiterated that: \u201c. . . \u2018A new trial in a criminal case will be awarded on the ground of after-discovered evidence where the evidence in question (1) has been discovered after the trial and could not have been obtained at or prior to the conclusion of the trial by the exercise of reasonable diligence; (2) is not merely corroborative or cumulative; (3) will not be used solely for impeaching credibility of a witness; and (4) is of such nature and character that a different verdict will likely result if a new trial is granted.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Coleman, 438 Pa. 373, 376-77, 264 A. 2d 649, 651 (1970).\nOur general view of recanting testimony is equally settled: \u201cThe well-established rule is that an appellate court may not interfere with the denial or granting of a new trial where the sole ground is the alleged recantation of state witnesses unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Green, 387 Pa. 515, 128 A. 2d 577 (1957); Commonwealth v. Sholder, 201 Pa. Superior Ct. 642, 644-645, 193 A. 2d 632 (1963).\n\u201cRecanting testimony is exceedingly unreliable, and it is the duty of the court to deny a new trial where it is not satisfied that such testimony is true. Commonwealth v. Scull, 200 Pa. Superior Ct. 122, 130, 186 A. 2d 854 (1962). There is no less reliable form of proof, especially when it involves an admission of perjury. Commonwealth ex rel. Leeper v. Russell, 199 Pa. Superior Ct. 93, 96, 184 A. 2d 149 (1962), Commonwealth v. Sholder, supra.\u201d Commonwealth v. Coleman, supra at 377, 264 A. 2d at 651.\nHowever, we have not previously been presented with precisely the factual situation that now confronts us. Frieda gave the only testimony which could possibly have led to appellant\u2019s conviction. Not an iota of other corroborating evidence was offered. To the contrary, the testimony of Frieda\u2019s mother and the medical evidence supported appellant\u2019s version of the incident and the recantation testimony. Furthermore, Frieda\u2019s retraction was corroborated by her great aunt.\nWe are in accord with the court en banc and Judge Hoffman's dissent that \u2019Frieda\u2019s deposition of June 28 constituted after discovered evidence. It was not available until after the trial, it was not merely corroborative, it will not he used for mere purposes of impeachment, and it unquestionably is of such character as to probably result in a different verdict if a new trial is held.\nUpon careful consideration, we believe it was a clear abuse of discretion not to award a new trial under these circumstances and thereby allow a new jury to pass on the child prosecutrix\u2019s credibility. Rape, as Lord Hals observed in the seventeenth century, \u201c. . . is an accusation easily to be made and hard to be proved; and harder to be defended by the party accused, tho never so innocent.\u201d I M. Hale, Pleas of the Crown 635. In recognition of this truism, some jurisdictions have adopted the rule that uncorroborated testimony of a prosecutrix is insufficient evidence to support a conviction of rape. See, e.g., N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7130.15 (McKinney 1967); see generally 7 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a72061 (3d ed. 1940).\nFalse accusations in sex crimes are generally conceded to be far more frequent than untrue charges of other crimes. As one author has summarized: \u201cA woman may accuse an innocent man of raping her because she is mentally sick and given to delusions; or because, having consented to intercourse, she is ashamed of herself and bitter at her partner; or because she is pregnant, and prefers a false explanation to the true one; or simply because she hates the man whom she accuses.\u201d Note, Corroborating Charges of Rape, 67 Col. L. Rev. 1137, 1138 (1967) (footnote omitted). See also, Wedmore v. State, 237 Ind. 212, 231-37, 143 N.E. 2d 649, 657-61 (1957) (dissenting opinion which extensively reviews medical authorities on subject).\nWe do not mean to imply that we are today in any way altering the established rule in this Commonwealth that uncorroborated testimony of one witness\u2014the victim\u2014can be sufficient to sustain a conviction of rape. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Ebert, 146 Pa. Superior Ct. 362, 22 A. 2d 610 (1941); Commonwealth v. Oyler, 130 Pa. Superior Ct. 405, 197 Atl. 508 (1938). However, where as here the defendant\u2019s conviction is based completely on testimony of the child prosecutrix and the truth of that testimony is open to serious question because of the testimony of a disinterested medical witness, a subsequent recantation of testimony as supported by this record necessitates a new trial.\nThe Superior Court has previously arrived at a similar result in a remarkably analogous situation. In Commonwealth v. Krick, 164 Pa. Superior Ct. 516, 67 A. 2d 746 (1949), the defendant was convicted of statutory rape of a twelve year old girl. Slightly more than two weeks after the end of the trial the girl retracted her testimony, stating her father had told her to give false evidence, which she did out of revenge for the mother\u2019s leaving home. In a unanimous opinion the Superior Court declared: \u201cFreda\u2019s letter and affidavit do not merely impeach her credibility but completely destroy and obliterate the testimony of the one witness upon whose testimony the defendant was convicted. The jury\u2019s verdict cannot be sustained without her testimony. In effect the young girl says that she committed perjury, and it was upon her perjured testimony that the defendant was convicted. ... In the absence of sworn evidence impeaching the girl\u2019s retraction a new trial should have been granted.\u201d Id. at 520, 67 A. 2d at 749.\nIn the present case, not only is there nothing to contradict Frieda\u2019s recantation, there is evidence from her great aunt that Frieda admitted a month prior to trial that she had fabricated the story. Additionally, Frieda persisted in her retraction despite having been informed that she was thereby subject to criminal charges for perjury and a substantial prison term. This was a clear declaration against interest entitled to considerable credibility, unlike the normal retraction by a co-conspirator who is already in prison and realistically has little to lose by attempting to free his partner. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Coleman, supra; Commonwealth v. Collins, 436 Pa. 114, 259 A. 2d 160 (1969).\nAccordingly, the order of the Superior Court is reversed and the motion for a new trial granted.\nMr. Justice Barbieri dissents."}
