{"id": "1008552", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nFebruary 21, 1910:\nWe concur in the conclusion stated in the opinion of the learned president judge of the orphans\u2019 court that the rights of the appellants were fixed by the adjudication of the orphans\u2019 court filed in 1903 and by the decree of that court on a petition for review, which was affirmed by this court, in Michener\u2019s Est., 225 Pa. 60. But aside from the question of res adjudicata, the contention of the appellants is not well founded. The gift to them was not of a moiety of the entire income, but of the income of a moiety of the estate. The direction in the seventh item of the testator\u2019s will is to \u201caverage the income of all the investments of my estate and to pay over to my sister Mary Michener the income of the sum of ten thousand dollars for and during the term of her natural life \u2014 And also to pay over to my niece Emma G. Rurnsey the income of the sum of five thousand dollars for and during the term of her natural life \u2014 And also to pay over to my niece Anna G. Rumsey the income of the sum of five thousand dollars for and during the term of her natural life.\u201d This direction applied to the income while the estate was held in trust and until the direction to distribute became operative upon the death of his wife and daughter. Otherwise the direction to distribute upon their deaths was meaningless. All of the trusts except those for the appellants having terminated and the gift of income to them having been secured by the setting aside of an ample sum, there is no reason why the balance of the estate should not be distributed.\nThe decree is affirmed."}
