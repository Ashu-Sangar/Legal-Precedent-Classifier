{"id": "941851", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Potteb,\nLouis C. Vanuxem, Esq., of Springfield township, Montgomery county, made his last will and testament dated October 16, 1903. By item seven of his will he gives his executors full power and discretion to sell any or all of his real estate, whenever any such sale be necessary or expedient for any purpose of his estate, of administration, distribution or otherwise. -He was seized of certain real estate in Tennessee and Illinois, and upon this property, the appraiser of collateral inheritance tax, assessed taxes. This was done upon the ground that the directions in the will worked an equitable conversion of the lands into personal property, by authorizing the executors in their discretion to sell for distribution, and the further fact that it became necessary to sell in order to pay the pecuniary legatees.\nThe orphans\u2019 court sustained the action of the appraiser. It was not pretended that the real estate in other states could be charged with collateral inheritance tax as real estate, but only by reason of the fact that it was necessary for the executors to sell it, in order to provide the money to pay the pecuniary legacies. And that being the case, the power to sell if 'necessary to make distribution, became -under the manifest intent of the testator, a direction to sell.\nThe judge of the orphans\u2019 court thus reasons it out in his opinion : \u201c The pecuniary legacies are to be paid before those to whom the residuary is given shall receive anything, because it is only what remains of the estate, after the specific legacies are paid, that passes as residue or remainder. These legacies pass to the legatees as money. The testator intended them to be paid in cash. There is nothing in the language of the will to show they are to be paid in any other way. Their character is personalty. He must have foreseen the necessity for the sale of his real estate to carry out his scheme of dividing his estate by first bestowing gifts upon the beneficiaries in the form of pecuniary legacies, else how were they to be paid ? \u201d\nThe pecuniary legacies aggregated nearly $700,000, or very much more than the amount of the personal estate, so that we cannot see any way by which the executors can escape converting the land into money, in order to carry out the provisions of the will. We agree with the conclusion of the court below, that \u201c an equitable conversion is as effectually accomplished by the will, and the duties of the executors under it are the same as if it contained a positive direction to sell.\u201d It follows as a matter of course that if sold, the proceeds of these lands must come' into the courts of Pennsylvania for distribution. The tax, therefore, falls upon the legacies themselves, rather than upon the lands which are now appraised in order to determine the amount of the tax.\nThe opinion of the court below has met so clearly the questions involved in this appeal and has disposed of them so fully, that further elaboration, upon our part, is both difficult and unnecessary.\nThe assignments of error are overruled and the decree of the orphans\u2019 court is affirmed."}
