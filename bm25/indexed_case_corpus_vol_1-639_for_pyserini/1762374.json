{"id": "1762374", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an Order of the Superior Court which reversed an Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County holding in favor of appellant, Ohio Valley Provision Company (Buyer), in an action for breach of contract brought by appellee, Atalanta Corporation (Seller). Seller, engaged in the business of distributing meat products to processors, brought suit to recover damages for the alleged failure of Buyer, a large meat processing business, to provide a bank guaranty to secure payment for a quantity of meat ordered from Seller.\nIn January, 1974, Seller\u2019s salesman solicited from Buyer a $19,000 order for Irish beef trimmings. Subsequently, the salesman requested that Buyer furnish a bank guaranty securing payment of the purchase price and, consequently, on February 20, 1974, Buyer\u2019s bank sent a letter to Seller containing language identical (except for date and dollar amount) to the subsequent letter dated May 8, 1974 which appears hereafter. On February 22, 1974, Seller\u2019s credit manager received the letter but was dissatisfied with the language therein because of an ambiguity as to whether the letter constituted a guarantee or a mere credit reference. The credit manager telephoned the president of Buyer\u2019s bank who said the letter was a guarantee. The Irish beef trimmings were then released to Buyer in March of 1974 and payment was made by Buyer.\nOn or about February 22, 1974, the same salesman solicited a much larger order for a $33,000 sale to Buyer of Australian Shank Meat. A written confirmation of sale containing the words \u201cbank guarantee due prior to delivery\u201d was mailed to Buyer but due to an incorrect address was never received. On May 8, 1974, when no bank guarantee had been forthcoming, the salesman visited Buyer and demanded such a guaranty. Buyer\u2019s president agreed to have one furnished, dispatched the salesman to go the bank, and telephoned ahead to the bank\u2019s vice president instructing him to prepare a guaranty. While at the bank, the salesman telephoned Seller\u2019s credit manager who stated he wanted a letter of credit from the bank rather than a bank guarantee. Buyer\u2019s president, however, declined to agree to have a letter of credit supplied so the following letter was sent by the bank instead:\n\u201cMay 8, 1974\nAtalanta Corporation\n1725 Varick Street\nNew York, New York 10013\nAttention: Credit Manager\nGentlemen:\nOne of our valued customers, Ohio Valley Provision Company has placed an order with your company in the amount of approximately $33,000.00 and we understand that you want a guarantee before releasing the meat products to them.\nYou may be assured that this amount will be paid by the above mentioned company within 10 days. This company has been a customer of ours since their organization and maintains substantial balances with us.\nVery truly yours,\n(s) E. R. MILLER\nE. R. MILLER\nPresident\u201d\nAfter receipt of this letter, Seller communicated to Buyer and the bank that a sufficient bank guaranty had not been received; hence, shipment of the goods was never made.\nOn May 8, 1974 a contract was formed requiring a bank guarantee as a term of payment. Buyer contends that Seller\u2019s request for a letter of credit constituted a material breach of contract which excused Buyer from further performance including the furnishing of a bank guarantee. We disagree. By asking for a letter of credit, after a contract had been formed between Buyer and Seller\u2019s sales agent, Seller did not breach the contract but rather requested a material change in contract terms which was objected to and did not become part of the contract. Hence, the contract remained in its original form requiring a bank guarantee. After receipt of the bank\u2019s letter of May 8, 1974, Seller communicated to Buyer and to Buyer\u2019s bank that a sufficient guaranty had not been received. Consequently, Seller never shipped the ordered goods.\nIf the letter of May 8, 1974 constituted the promised bank guarantee then Seller breached its obligation to deliver the goods. Buyer and Seller do not dispute the existence of a contract binding them but rather implicitly focus their arguments on an analysis of whether, based on the bank\u2019s letter of May 8, 1974 and the attendant circumstances, the letter would likely have created bank liability to Seller in the event the goods had been delivered and Buyer refused to pay. It is not necessary to determine the probable ultimate effect of the letter in question. The overriding issue is simply whether the parties exchanged that which was bargained for by the parties and reasonably contemplated by the same as the mode of performance, termed by them as a \u201cbank guaranty\u201d.\nBy requiring a bank guaranty in a transaction, the Seller\u2019s purpose, obvious to both parties, is to avoid the risk of default in payment. Both parties are, therefore, chargeable with knowledge when a \u201cbank guarantee\u201d is bargained for that the Seller is not bargaining for a document of such uncertain meaning that, in light of the circumstances, acceptance of the same would force a reasonably cautious businessman to knowingly be exposed to the very risk of non-payment against which he sought to ensure. This case, then, is to be distinguished from those where the effect of a purported guaranty which has already been accepted by a Seller is to be determined. A guaranty is a promise to pay the debt of another when the creditor is unable, after due prosecution, to collect the amount owed by the debtor. Strohecker v. Farmers Bank, 6 Pa. 41, 44 (1847). The alleged guarantee in question, without regard to whether under rules of construction and in light of the circumstances an arguable liability for the bank in a suit by Seller may have existed, could not have constituted the \u201cBank Guarantee\u201d necessarily contemplated as suitable for commercial reliance by the parties. A cautious Seller could reasonably interpret the letter of May 8, 1974 as a carefully worded attempt by the bank to avoid obligating itself by giving only an opinion as to the customer\u2019s reliability and credit-worthiness without promising that the bank would pay the obligation upon the customer\u2019s failure to do so. In the prior sale in which Seller was furnished with a letter dated February 20, 1974 like that dated May 8, 1974, the Seller questioned the sufficiency of the language and although the goods were subsequently released in that one smaller transaction a sequence of prior dealing is not present to support a conclusion that in the transaction in question, where Seller had more of a financial stake, the parties intended less than a reasonably unambiguous guaranty to be furnished.\nOrder affirmed.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which EAG-EN, C. J., joins.\nLARSEN, J., concurs in the result.\nKAUFFMAN, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nROBERTS, Justice,\nconcurring.\nI concur in the result reached by the majority. It is clear that the buyer promised the seller, as part of their sales contract, to provide a bank guarantee for the purchase price, and that the buyer breached this material term of the contract.
