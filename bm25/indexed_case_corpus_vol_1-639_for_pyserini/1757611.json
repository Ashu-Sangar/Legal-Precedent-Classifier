{"id": "1757611", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, Arthur Pitts, was tried by a judge sitting with a jury for the homicide of Edward Carter on December 23, 1975. The jury found appellant guilty of murder of the third degree and possessing instruments of crime. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to ten to twenty years in prison for the conviction of murder of the third degree and two and one-half to five years on the instruments of crime conviction, both sentences to be concurrent. This appeal followed.\nAppellant first argues the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain his conviction for murder of the third degree. This argument centers on appellant\u2019s belief the jury should have accepted defense testimony of voluntary intoxication, rather than the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence.\nThe facts surrounding this issue are as follows. On December 23, 1975, appellant and decedent, Edward Carter, were drinking alcoholic beverages during the day. The testimony indicates a quantity of wine and large quantities of whiskey were consumed by appellant, decedent and a mutual friend, \u201cMr. Lumpkin.\u201d At approximately 6:00 p. m., Roberta Johnson, decedent\u2019s paramour, helped decedent upstairs to the bedroom. Johnson\u2019s assistance was necessary as Carter was intoxicated. Both Carter and Johnson lie on the bed, Johnson watching television and Carter sleeping. Appellant entered the room, attempted to wake up Carter, and complained that Carter was involved with \u201chis woman.\u201d During this argument, Johnson left the bedroom, but asked Lumpkin to go up to the bedroom to watch decedent and appellant. Upon .her return to the bedroom, Johnson was asked by Lumpkin to call the police. She entered the room and saw Carter on the couch. He had sustained stab wounds of the stomach and leg, which caused his death. As Johnson went to the house next door to call police, she noticed appellant leaving the house where the stabbing had occurred. She saw him drop a kitchen knife and then retrieve it. Subsequently, when the police arrived at the scene of the Carter slaying appellant returned to the house and attempted to conceal the knife in a flower pot. The knife was found by the police and it was later determined the knife had human blood on it. Appellant was then arrested. The arresting and interrogating officers both testified that although appellant\u2019s breath did smell of alcohol, his reflexes and ability to understand and discuss events surrounding the stabbing appeared unimpaired.\nIn Commonwealth v. Firth, 479 Pa. 333, 388 A.2d 683 (1978), this court reiterated the standard of appellate review in judging the sufficiency of the evidence:\n\u201cIn Commonwealth v. Rose, 463 Pa. 264, 267-68, 344 A.2d 824, 825-826 (1975), we stated:\n\u201c \u2018The test of sufficiency of the evidence is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and drawing the proper inferences favorable to the Commonwealth, the trier of fact could reasonably have found that all of the elements of the crime had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, it is the province of the trier of fact to pass upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence produced. . . . The fact-finder is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence.\nA review of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence reveals that evidence to be sufficient, if it is believed. The factfinder can believe all, part or none of the testimony.\nAppellant next argues that the court below erred in failing to instruct the jury on the relationship of voluntary intoxication to the intent element of voluntary manslaughter.\nThe trial court charged:\n\u201cIn the event you should be persuaded to entertain the question of finding the defendant guilty of only voluntary manslaughter, whether he might have been intoxicated would then be no part whatever of your reasoning, and you must as to that determination dismiss all evidence of his intoxication from your consideration.\u201d (N.T. 434).\nThe relevant statute, in effect at the time of this crime, stated:\n\u201cIntoxication or drugged condition are not, as such, defenses to a criminal charge; but in any prosecution for any offense, evidence of intoxication or drugged condition of the defendant may be offered by the defendant whenever it is relevant to negative an element of the offense.\u201d Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, eff. June 6, 1973. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 308.\nSection 308 makes clear that evidence of intoxication is relevant and admissible to negate an element of a crime.\nThis court, in Commonwealth v. Graves, 461 Pa. 118, 122-23, 334 A.2d 661 (1975), stated:\n\u201cThe only permissible probative value evidence of intoxication may have in criminal proceedings is where it is relevant to the question of the capacity of the actor to have possessed the requisite intent of the crime charged. Where the legislature, in its definition of a crime, has designated a particular state of mind as a material element of the crime, evidence of intoxication becomes relevant if the degree of inebriation has reached that point where the mind was incapable of attaining the state of mind required. It must be emphasized that although evidence of intoxication never provides a basis for exoneration or excuse, it may in some instances be relevant to establish that the crime charged in fact did not occur.\n\u201cRejecting the view that an evidentiary rule relating to the introduction of evidence of intoxication must be strictly construed to avoid condoning voluntarily induced intoxication, most text writers have recognized the issue as being whether the crime in fact has been committed and considered the question accordingly:\n\u201c 'Where a particular purpose, motive or intent is a necessary element to constitute the particular kind or degree of crime, it is proper to consider the mental condition of accused, although produced by voluntary intoxication, and, where he lacked the mental capacity to entertain the requisite purpose, motive, or intent, such incapacity may constitute a valid defense to the particular crime charged, and the same rule applies to voluntary intoxication resulting in mental incapacity to indulge premeditation or deliberation, which precludes conviction of an offense wherein premeditation is essential .\n\u201c \u2018The majority rule, holding intoxication to an extent precluding capacity to entertain a specific intent or to premeditate to be a defense, does so not because drunkenness excuses crime, but because, if the mental status required by law to constitute crime be one of specific intent or of deliberation and premeditation, and drunkenness excludes the existence of such mental state, then the particular crime charged has not in fact been committed.\n\u201c \u2018Where a specific intent is an ingredient of the crime charged, the fact that that accused\u2019s drunkenness is voluntary does not render the defense of intoxication incompetent, since the intent to become intoxicated does not tend to prove an intent to commit the offense.\u2019 (Footnotes omitted.) 22 C.J.S. Criminal Law \u00a7 68, pp. 217-219.\u201d\nIn Commonwealth v. Mason, 474 Pa. 308, 378 A.2d 807 (1977), this court stated:\n\u201cThe trial court\u2019s refusal to charge the jury concerning the element of intent necessary to convict of voluntary manslaughter was error. The term \u2018voluntary manslaughter\u2019 contemplates an intentional or voluntary (emphasis in original) act on the part of the defendant. In Commonwealth v. Moore, 398 Pa. 198, 202 n. 2, 157 A.2d 65, 68 n. 2 (1959), the Court stated \u2018that where there is a nonmalicious felonious killing with a specific intent either to kill or to seriously injure, it is voluntary manslaughter. \u2019 (Emphasis added.) In Commonwealth v. Campbell, 451 Pa. 465, 468, 304 A.2d 121, 122 (1973), the court again speaking of voluntary manslaughter stated \u2018that it is an intentional killing (emphasis added in Mason) which is perpetrated while under the influence of overriding passion, . . . \u2019 In Commonwealth v. Butcher, 451 Pa. 359, 364, 304 A.2d 150, 153 (1973), this Court indicated that a necessary element of both murder in the first degree and voluntary manslaughter is the specific intent to kill.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)\nIn light of Commonwealth v. Mason, and the then applicable \u00a7 308 of the Crimes Code, the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury on the relationship of voluntary intoxication and the specific intent requirement of voluntary manslaughter. However, the Commonwealth argues the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree.\nThe jury in the instant case found appellant guilty of murder of the third degree. Murder of the third degree is a killing done with legal malice but without specific intent to kill. Murder of the third degree can, however, in some cases involve the specific intent to harm a victim as long as said intent falls short of the specific intent to kill. Voluntary manslaughter, on the other hand, involves the specific intent to kill but, by reason of passion and provocation, contains no legal malice.\nIn the instant case, appellant was found guilty of murder of the third degree. The jury thus found appellant had no specific intent to kill the victim. By such a finding, the jury found voluntary manslaughter was not applicable to this case. The error in the instant case could not harm appellant, unless he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, for only then would the issue of intoxication become relevant. We thus agree with the Commonwealth that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAppellant\u2019s third argument is that the district attorney misstated the law, thereby depriving him of a fair trial. The district attorney, in his closing, stated:\n\u201c . . . drinking, perhaps, all day, but, ladies and gentlemen, the Commonwealth also submits \u2014 and of course the Judge will give you the law; this is just the Commonwealth\u2019s submission to you \u2014 that intoxication is not a defense to third degree murder or to voluntary manslaughter; that voluntary intoxication is no defense to the events or to the incident with which the defendant is charged in this case.\n\u201cIf you believe, for example, that the defendant after drinking all day \u2014 if you believe that he drank what he says he drank\u2014\n\u201cMR. ZWANETZ: Your Honor, objection. The objection is to the statement of law, as not coming from the Court.\n\u201cTHE COURT: He is free to comment on the law. The jury will take the law as the Court instructs them, but counsel are free to discuss the law. As to the facts, the jury determines what the facts are.\n\u201cI will overrule your objection.\u201d\nCounsel did not contest the correctness of the statement at trial. Counsel only objected to the statement of law by the district attorney. On appeal, appellant now attempts to argue that the statements were erroneous.\n\u201c . . .It has long been the rule in this jurisdiction that if the ground upon which an objection is based is specifically stated, all other reasons for its exclusion are waived, and may not be raised post trial. Commonwealth v. McNeal, 456 Pa. 394, 398, 319 A.2d 669 (1974); Commonwealth v. Budd, 443 Pa. 193, 195, 278 A.2d 879 (1971); Commonwealth v. Raymond, 412 Pa. 194, 202-203, 194 A.2d 150 (1963).\u201d Commonwealth v. Stoltzfus, 462 Pa. 43, 337 A.2d 873 (1975).\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.\nEAGEN, C. J., and NIX, J., concur in the result.\nROBERTS, J., files a dissenting opinion in which MANDERINO, J., joins.\n. Appellant properly appealed the murder conviction to this court and the possession of instruments of crime conviction to the Superior Court, which certified the appeal to this court for disposition.\n. The medical examiner testified that Carter had received nine stab wounds.\n. Section 308 was subsequently amended to read:\n\u201cNeither voluntary intoxication nor voluntary drugged condition is a defense to a criminal charge, nor may evidence of such conditions be introduced to negative the element of intent of the offense, except that evidence of such intoxication or drugged condition of the defendant may be offered by the defendant whenever it is relevant to reduce murder from a higher degree to a lower degree of murder.\u201d As amended April 7, 1976, P.L. 72, No. 32, \u00a7 1, imd. effective.\n. In Graves, \u00a7 308 was not applicable.\n\u201c3 \u2018Suppose on the other hand D has been arrested for larceny, having been found walking off with X\u2019s glass which he had no privilege or authority to carry away. Suppose again the only explanation he has to offer is that he was voluntarily drunk at the time and did not know what he was doing, the evidence indicating that he staggered away from the bar where he had been over-indulging and walked out into the street still clutching the glass from which he had been drinking, but too befuddled by liquor to know he was holding anything in his hand, \u2014 and when the glass was taken from him by the apprehending officer D stared at it blankly with no idea where it came from. The actus reus of larceny is the trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another. D has done this and his voluntary intoxication is no excuse, but the facts stated fail to establish larceny.\u2019 (Footnotes omitted). Perkins, Criminal Law, ch. 8, \u00a7 3 at 788 (1957)."}
