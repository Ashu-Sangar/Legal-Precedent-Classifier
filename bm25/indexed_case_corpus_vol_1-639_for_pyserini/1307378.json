{"id": "1307378", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nPlaintiff brought an action in equity to enjoin the erection of a second building upon a tract of land which defendant had purchased from Mary E. McWilliams.\nOn April 15, 1959, the nominees of the parties entered into an agreement of sale for a tract of 1.1 acres on the south side of Presidential Boulevard North in Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County, Pa. The Agreement provided, inter alia:\n\u201c12. Buyer agrees to improve the site with an office building; final plans and specifications for said building to be subject to the approval of the Owner, \u25a0 which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.\u201d\nOn July 13, 1959, the property was conveyed to the defendant and on July 22,1959, she applied for a building permit to erect an office building on the property in accordance with a plan which had been approved by the plaintiffs. The permit was granted and the building has been erected.\nOn January 3, 1961, defendant filed a plan for subdividing her tract. This plan was withdrawn because it would require a special exception. Thereafter, a new subdivision plan was filed which was approved by the municipal authorities, and defendant filed a new application for a building permit to erect a second building upon the aforesaid 1.1 acre tract. This permit was also granted by the township. Thereupon plaintiffs brought the present equitable action.\nPlaintiffs at the trial of this suit asked one of their witnesses \u201cWhat was your discussion with Mr. Strouse?\u201d Defendant's objection to this was sustained. Plaintiffs then offered to prove that prior to the written Agreement the parties intended the word \u201can\u201d to mean \u201conly one\u201d office building and that throughout the negotiations for a sale of the property \u2014as well as in the written Agreement itself \u2014 that was the intention of the parties as shown by their conversations and by certain correspondence which we note, parenthetically, did not support plaintiffs\u2019 contentions. The offer of proof was rejected by the Court and this is the basis for the appeal.\nThe Chancellor filed an adjudication and decree nisi in which he dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint and ordered judgment to be entered for the defendant. Plaintiffs filed no exceptions to the Chancellor\u2019s findings of fact, but excepted to his conclusions of law and to the Court\u2019s Order and Decree.\nIf the parties had intended to limit the land to one office building it would have been very easy to have used the word \u201cone\u201d. The Agreement contains no such restriction, nor any affirmative promise by the buyer to build only one office building. The fact that the buyer originally built an office building in compliance with the Agreement of Sale does not prove that the Agreement restricted buyer to only one office building or compelled her to erect on the land only one office building. Since the defendant-appellee agreed to improve the site with an office building which met with the approval of the plaintiffs-appellants, the obligation imposed by that provision of the contract has been complied with and ceases to have any further force and effect. To attempt to interpret the provision of the agreement as a perpetual covenant running with the land would impose restrictions on the future use of the land and impinge upon its alienability. Clear and explicit language is required to impose such a restriction.\nMoreover, the Agreement provides: \u201cThis agreement contains the whole agreement between the Seller and Buyer and there are no other terms, obligations, covenants, representations, statements or conditions, oral or otherwise, of any kind whatsoever.\u201d We note parenthetically, that this contention of plaintiffs would make this clause meaningless, and consequently such contention is devoid of merit: Bardwell v. The Willis Company, 375 Pa. 503, 508, 100 A. 2d 102.\nIt is difficult to understand, in view of the Parol Evidence Rule, how plaintiffs could be entitled to prove oral conversations or understandings which preceded the written agreement and thereby alter and vary the written Agreement as to one of the subjects provided for therein. To admit such evidence would make a mockery of the Parol Evidence Rule, as well as of the above mentioned clause of this Agreement.\nPlaintiffs next contend that the evidence should have been admitted under the well established rule that parol evidence is admissible \u2014 not to vary, alter, contradict or add to, but \u2014 to aid in the interpretation of the language of a written contract whenever the language is ambiguous or not clear: Foulke v. Miller, 381 Pa. 587, 593, 112 A. 2d 124.\nDefendant, on the other hand, contends that the written Agreement is clear and unambiguous and that the plaintiffs are in reality attempting to reform, alter and change the contract by substituting the words \u201conly one office building\u201d for the words \u201can office building\u201d.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 contention is devoid of merit. There is no ambiguity in the written Agreement of Sale. Plaintiffs\u2019 construction of the Agreement is erroneous and unjustifiable, and evidence of the alleged prior negotiations or understandings or oral agreements, flies in the teeth of the Parol Evidence Rule and was clearly inadmissible: Pellegrene v. Luther, 403 Pa. 212, 169 A. 2d 298; Bardwell v. The Willis Company, 375 Pa., supra; Caplan v. Saltzman, 407 Pa. 250, 180 A. 2d 240, and cases cited therein.\nDecree affirmed; costs to be paid by appellants.\nItalics, ours.\nReal estate agent for buyer."}
