{"id": "1933861", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Jones,\nThis is a direct appeal from the imposition of a life sentence following a jury determination that appellants, all of whom were represented by court-appointed counsel, Avere guilty of murder in the first degree.\nOn the morning of December 20, 1967, around 10:45 a.m., Hattie Littlestone, seventy-one years of age, was set upon and robbed of her purse by three youths. In the ensuing struggle to prevent the purse-snatching, she fell to the ground and the youths fled. Miss Little-stone was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. While a variety of contentions are raised, because of our disposition of this appeal we can confine our discussion to one point: whether sufficient evidence was introduced to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Hattie Littlestone\u2019s death was caused by a criminal agency.\nIn Com. v. Radford, 428 Pa. 279, 236 A. 2d 802 (1968), we clearly indicated that proof of causation must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. Attempting to meet this burden, the Chief Forensic Pathologist for the Coroner\u2019s Office of Allegheny County, Cyril H. Wecht, M.D., who performed the autopsy, testified for the prosecution that the sole cause of death was a myocardial infarction, commonly termed a \u201cheart attack.\u201d Despite the existence of a past history of cardiac-related problems, Dr. Wecht further opined, \u201cwith a reasonable degree of medical certainty,\u2019\u2019 that the myocardial infarction was caused by physical and emotional stress occasioned by the purse snatching and ensuing struggle. No other evidence was presented by the Commonwealth to directly link the purse snatching with Miss Littlestone\u2019s death.\nUpon cross-examination by the defense attorneys as well as questioning by the trial judge, Dr. Wecht expressly admitted that while he was positively certain that death occurred due to the infarction, he was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the struggle produced the stress which, in turn, could have caused the myocardial infarction. Instead, he was only able to reconstruct the chain of causation with a \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty.\u201d That the witness was not confused by this language is evidenced by his later testimony that in a proper case he could find causation beyond a reasonable doubt.\nIn Radford, the Commonwealth\u2019s witness was similarly unable to resolve the issue of causation beyond a reasonable doubt. To semantically distinguish Rad-ford\u2019s \u201cprobable\u201d from this appeal\u2019s \u201creasonable degree of medical certainty\u201d would be irrelevant since causation must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Although it is hornbook law that a jury is never bound by an expert witness, when only one witness is presented by the Commonwealth to establish causation and that witness cannot do so beyond a reasonable doubt, a necessary element of the proof of that crime is miss-Mg.\nJudgment of sentence reversed.\n.. Mr Justice Cohen took no part in the decision of this case.\nDr. Wecht testified that the autopsy also revealed the victim had \u201cevidence of long-standing disease of the coronary arteries\u201d and \u201cevidence of old scarring in the heart from previous heart attacks, previous myocardial infarctions.\u201d"}
