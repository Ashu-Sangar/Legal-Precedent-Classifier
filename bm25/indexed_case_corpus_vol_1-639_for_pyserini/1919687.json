{"id": "1919687", "contents": "Opinion by Mb.\nJustice Eagen,\nDuring the early morning hours of April 5, 1965, an unknown male surreptitiously entered the Philadelphia apartment of a female medical student at Jefferson Medical College, and brutally beat and raped her. Charles Holton was arrested for these crimes and eventually was convicted by a jury of assault and battery, aggravated assault and battery, assault and battery with intent to ravish, rape, and larceny. Post-trial motions in arrest of judgment and for a new trial were denied, following which an aggregate prison sentence of 21% to 43 years was imposed. On appeal the Superior Court affirmed without opinion. Judge Hope-man filed a dissenting opinion. See 209 Pa. Superior Ct. 22, 223 A. 2d 754 (1966). We granted allocatur and now reverse and order a new trial, because we conclude that Holton\u2019s trial violated the requirements of due process of law.\nHolton was taken into custody by two investigating police officers without a warrant on April 7, 1965, at about 11:30 a.m., and escorted to the police administration building. At about 4:30 p.m., or after a delay of approximately 5 hours, occasioned by the fact that the officers were attempting to ascertain whether the victim was physically able to confront Holton, a \u201cformal interrogation\u201d commenced. Within minutes thereafter, according to the police officers whose testimony was offered by the Commonwealth, Holton spontaneously stated: \u201cLook, I broke into that house, but I don\u2019t remember raping that girl.\u201d He was immediately warned by one of the questioning officers: \u201cNow I have to advise you anything you say is going to be used either for or against you. Now you don\u2019t have a lawyer, so you still don\u2019t have to make a statement. But if you want a lawyer you will either get one at a hearing tomorrow morning. ... If you care not to make a statement now, don\u2019t make it.\u201d Holton was then taken downstairs to a cafeteria for a cup of coffee and minutes later, upon being returned to the \u201cinterview room,\u201d he orally admitted his guilt. Evidence of his statement was introduced, over objection, at trial.\nHolton was taken into custody solely on the basis of a tip given to the police by an unidentified informer. This informant concededly was not an eyewitness to the crimes and did not have personal knowledge of Holton\u2019s whereabouts at the time of the occurrence. Neither at the hearing on the motion to suppress the evidence of Holton\u2019s incriminating statement, nor at the trial itself, did the arresting officers reveal any facts or circumstances disclosed by the informant which led to the belief Holton had committed the crimes involved. Hence, as far as this record is concerned, the arrest was illegal.\nAn arrest without a warrant must be based on probable cause, i.e., there must be facts available to the officers at the moment of the arrest which \u201cwould warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief\u201d that the individual arrested has committed an offense. Carroll v. United States, 267 U.S. 132, 162, 45 S. Ct. 280 (1925); McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, 87 S. Ct. 1056 (1967). Mere suspicion is not enough and the burden is upon the Commonwealth to show with reasonable specificity facts sufficient to establish that probable cause existed. Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 85 S. Ct. 223 (1964). The instant record is barren of such proof.\nThe illegality of Holton\u2019s arrest does not necessarily preclude the use of his subsequent incriminating statement as evidence. This depends upon a determination of whether or not the statement was the product of the exploitation of the initial illegality or was secured by means sufficiently distinguishable from that illegality to purge it of the primary taint. United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S. Ct. 1926 (1967); Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S. Ct. 407 (1963); Commonwealth ex rel. Craig v. Maroney, 348 F. 2d 22 (3d Cir. 1965); and Commonwealth v. Bishop, 425 Pa. 175, 228 A. 2d 661 (1967). However, since we conclude that the use of Holton\u2019s statement was precluded for another equally important reason, we need not resolve this question.\nAt the suppression hearing and at trial, Holton testified that while he was in custody and questioned by the police, he was \u201cgetting the d.t.\u2019s\u201d as an aftermath of prior consumption of too much alcohol; that he was continuously sick and suffered from nausea and pains in the stomach and head; that he was cold, sweaty and shaking all over; that he requested medical assistance which was refused but promised \u201cwhen it was all over\u201d; that after relentless questioning by several police officers he finally agreed to admit anything they wanted him to in order \u201cto get out of the place for a while . . . and get some fresh air.\u201d While the police officers\u2019 testimony denied much of the foregoing and painted a different picture of Holton\u2019s physical condition at the pertinent time, uncontradicted facts in the record reveal that Holton\u2019s condition was more or less as he himself described.\n(1) At the hearing before the committing magistrate on April 12, 1965, when asked a question relating to Holton\u2019s condition during the police questioning, the chief investigating officer and interrogator testified as follows: \u201cHe [Holton] had problems with his drinking and blackouts in certain areas. And he wasn\u2019t very coherent on that day I questioned him;\u201d (2) During the period Holton was in custody he requested and drank an unusually large amount of water; (3) During the period of questioning Holton complained of pains in the stomach and was given an antacid pill by the police; (4) Immediately after he admitted his guilt, Holton was permitted to lie down on the floor for about 30 minutes; (5) Shortly thereafter, Holton was taken via automobile to the place where he told the police he had hidden certain articles stolen from the victim\u2019s apartment (but Avhich were not there when the searching party arrived). During the return trip Holton\u2019s condition was such that the accompanying police officers stopped at a bar and got him a glass of wine; (6) On the morning of April 8th, a physician at the Detention Center of the Philadelphia Prison system, after examining Holton, concluded that he was \u201ca chronic alcoholic who has had several episodes of d.t.\u2019s\u201d and directed that he be placed on the center\u2019s \u201calcohol withdrawal regime,\u201d which included, inter alia, the consumption of medicine three times a day to arrest the withdrawal incidents; (7) On April 9th, a consulting psychiatrist of the Philadelphia Prison system saAV Holton and diagnosed and described his condition as folloAVS: \u201cIn the state of withdrawal from alcohol .... In a withdrawal state but not full-bloAvn d.t.\u2019s . . . exceptionally anxious, nervous, overwrought, gave indications of being somewhat agitated . . . This was possible prodrome to a delirium tremens state.\u201d\nDue process prohibits the evidentiary use of a criminal defendant\u2019s incriminating statements unless it is first established that those statements were \u201cthe product of a rational intellect and a free will.\u201d Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U.S. 528, 83 S. Ct. 917 (1963), and Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S. Ct. 745 (1963). The determination of whether or not such evidence meets these required standards depends on a consideration of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d Davis v. North Carolina, 384 U.S. 737, 86 S. Ct. 1761 (1966); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 80 S. Ct. 274 (1960); Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U.S. 596, 64 S. Ct. 1208 (1944); and Commonwealth ex rel. Gaito v. Maroney, 422 Pa. 171, 220 A. 2d 628 (1966). And the accused\u2019s physical and mental condition must be considered, for sickness or ill health may well influence his will to resist and make him prone to overbearing and improper questioning. Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433, 81 S. Ct. 1541 (1961). For the inquiry as to the voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s incriminating statements cannot be narrowed to a consideration of whether or not the police resorted to physical abuse in procuring them; equally relevant on the issue of voluntariness is the determination of whether or not the accused\u2019s will was overborne at the time he made the statements. Reck v. Pate, supra.\nAfter a careful consideration of all the relevant circumstances disclosed by this record, particularly the unchallenged facts related before, we unhesitatingly conclude that Holton\u2019s incriminating statement should have been excluded. These words of Mr. Justice Roberts, speaking for a unanimous Court, in Commonwealth ex rel. Caito v. Maroney, supra, at 179 are most apt: \u201cOur judgment is based not only on the lack of a rational choice on the part of appellant but also on \u2018a strong conviction that our system of law enforcement should not operate so as to take advantage of a person in this fashion.\u2019 \u201d\nAt least one other incident at trial requires discussion.\nAfter the jury had deliberated for 22 hours without reaching a verdict, further instructions were requested \u201con the identification and alleged statement of the defendant.\u201d These instructions were given and then the tidal judge finalized his remarks in this manner: \u201cNow, you have taken a long time considering this case. You are citizens of this city, and you are citizens of America, and act as such. You are not living in a foreign country. You are here in a land of freedom where we try to protect people, and that\u2019s all the people, not just some of the people, everybody needs protection of the courts. If they don\u2019t get protection of the courts, you won\u2019t get protection of the courts either when your day comes in court. Remember that. You destroy the principles upon which democracy sits in America by not giving proper and adequate consideration, they won\u2019t be existing for you when you have your day in court. I\u2019m not telling you what kind of verdict to bring in, but I\u2019m telling you to stand up like men and women and do what you should do before your God to whom you will answer some day whether you answer to this court or not. You will answer to God some day for the way you conduct yourselves in this case. The chips will be down, and He Avill know everything you have done. You won\u2019t withhold one thing from Him.\u201d Twenty minutes later, the jury found Holton guilty.\nWhile we are admiringly aware of the trial judge\u2019s intense patriotism and dedication to his religious convictions, it is our view that the portion of his supplemental charge, quoted above, was improper. Judge Hoffman pointedly expressed the sin and prejudicial effect thereof in his dissenting opinion. 209 Pa. Superior Ct. 22 at 27: \u201cAppellant contends that this exhortation amounted to binding instructions to the jury to bring in a verdict of guilty. The Commonwealth argues, on the other hand, that this charge suggested to the jury that it should acquit appellant.\n\u201cIt is not for us to determine the court\u2019s intent in making this statement or the jury\u2019s inference from it. What is significant is that both interpretations are equally plausible. More importantly, individual jurors might have concluded, as appellant suggests, that the court was threatening them with the wrath of God should they bring in a verdict of not guilty.\u201d\nThe order of the Superior Court and the judgments of the Courts of Oyer and Terminer and Quarter Sessions are reversed and a new trial is ordered.\nBecause of the seriousness of her injuries, the victim was hospitalized.\nHolton\u2019s testimony differed in material part, but for the purposes of this appeal we accept the Commonwealth\u2019s testimony as true.\nA pretrial motion to suppress was denied after hearing.\nSome of tMs testimony was of a negative nature, sucli as, \u201cI didn\u2019t see any sweating.\u201d"}
