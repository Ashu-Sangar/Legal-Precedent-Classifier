{"id": "1099657", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Walling,\nElizabeth P. Fairman, wife of W. M. Fairman, Esq., of Jefferson County, died May 1, 1921, her last will being as follows: \u201cFirst. I give and bequeath to my husband, W. M. Fairman, all my property, personal, real and mixed, to him and his assigns, forever. 2nd. At his death if any is left I direct it to go to my sister, Mary A. Jefferson, if living at the death of W. M. Fair-man, if not then to my brother\u2019s children, share and share alike. 3rd. I hereby appoint my husband W. M. Fairman, sole executor of this my last will and testament.\u201d W. M. Fairman, who survived his wife, died May 31, 1925, and his last will purports to give the property acquired, by virtue of his wife\u2019s will, to the same legatee, Mary A. Jefferson. The latter\u2019s title is unquestioned, the only point is under which will it vested; if under that of Mr. Fairman, it is subject to the transfer inheritance tax here claimed. Upon the death of Mrs. Fairman an inheritance tax was charged against her estate and paid. The trial court found her will conferred upon her husband a life estate with right of consumption, and what was not consumed, practically her entire estate, passed under her will to her sister, the appellee, not subject to be taxed as the husband\u2019s estate; thereupon the Commonwealth brought this appeal.\nIn our opinion the case was rightly decided. True, the language of the first clause of the will was sufficient to vest in Mr. Fairman a fee simple estate; the word \u201cheirs\u201d not being necessary in a will under the Act of April 8, 1833, P. L. 250 (4 Stewart\u2019s Purdon\u2019s Digest 5137), or as reenacted by the Wills Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 407. It is also true that an estate devised in fee cannot by subsequent limitations be stripped of its legal incidents, like the power of alienation: Pattin v. Scott, 270 Pa. 49. But a will must be construed as a whole and if reasonably possible every word must be given effect (Ludwick\u2019s Est., 269 Pa. 365), and if by subsequent provisions it appears with reasonable clearness that, notwithstanding the fee simple gift implied from the language first employed, only a life estate was intended, such intention will control. See Long\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 480; Fassitt v. Seip, 240 Pa. 406; Good v. Fichthorn, 144 Pa. 287. It is not a question of depriving an estate of its legal incidents but of what estate the will in fact gave the first taker. Doubtless Mr. Fairman might have disposed of the estate in his lifetime, but he did not, and the language in her will, \u201cat his death if any is left I direct it to go to my sister,\u201d etc., is mandatory and not merely precatory. It is clearly testamentary language. No power is given the husband to dispose of the estate by will; otherwise the case would be in line with Robinson\u2019s Est, 282 Pa. 531. The trial judge properly held there was no controlling difference between the instant case and Stanton et al. v. Guest et al., 285 Pa. 460, which holds, \u201cWhere a testator in the first instance uses language suitable to the grant of a fee simple estate, but, by subsequent words, immediately following in the devise, indicates a dominant intent to give only a less estate, the latter purpose will be upheld.\u201d The reasoning of Mr. Justice Frazer there and the authorities cited are equally applicable here and need not be repeated. In Wettengel\u2019s Est., 278 Pa. 571, the Chief Justice, speaking for the court, says (p. 573): \u201cWe have repeatedly held that where the dominant purpose shown by a devise is to vest a fee, this estate cannot be stripped of its inherent attributes by subsequent words indicating an intent so to do: Pattin v. Scott, 270 Pa. 49, 51, and cases there cited: Long\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 480, 485-6. On the other hand, we have probably as often held that, in finding the controlling intention, all the words used by testator should be taken into account, and, if the intent to restrict the gift is clear, it must be given effect: Smith v. Piper, 231 Pa. 378, 384; Schuldt v. Reading Tr. Co., 270 Pa. 360, 364; Edwards v. Newland, 271 Pa. 1, 4\u201d; reaffirmed in Deeter\u2019s Est., 280 Pa. 135, 141. See also McCullough\u2019s Est., 272 Pa. 509. Fidelity Title & Trust Co., Guardian, v. Nibozin et al., 4 Adv., p. 390, (Advance Reports for September 24, 1926) [88 Pa. Superior Ct. 113], states (we quote from the syllabus) that, \u201cA gift of all testator\u2019s property to his wife, To her and her heirs and assigns forever and after her death whatever property there may be left, shall be equally divided among my children,\u2019 passed a life estate only with power to consume and any part undisposed of at her death goes to testator\u2019s children.\u201d These very recent decisions are so strikingly like the instant case as to render further discussion unnecessary. Appellee having received the estate as Mrs. Fairman\u2019s legatee, it is not subject to a transfer tax as property of Mr. Fairman.\nThe decree is affirmed."}
