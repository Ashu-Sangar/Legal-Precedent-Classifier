{"id": "1084515", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nJacob Margolis, attorney-at-law, was disbarred by the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County on September 15, 1920, and February 14, 1921, the decree was affirmed by this court: Margolis\u2019s Case, 269 Pa. 206. He has filed a petition asking us to \u201creadmit\u201d him and issue \u201ca certificate to that effect\u201d so that he may \u201cpractice law outside of the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d\nThe rules of this court provide that all proceedings for disbarment shall be had in the \u201cproper court\u201d of the county where the attorney \u201cmisbehaved himself,\u201d or where \u201chis office\u201d is located, or in \u201cthe proper court of another county near thereto\u201d; see Buie 17. This court acts purely as an appellate tribunal; though, when we affirm a disbarment order, the effect, under the above rule, is to, strike the name of the attorney from our roll. A petition such as the one at bar, which asks us to reconsider the facts on which the decree is based, should be made to the court that found those facts, and not to us.\nThe petition is dismissed."}
