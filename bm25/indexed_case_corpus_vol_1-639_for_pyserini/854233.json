{"id": "854233", "contents": "Per Curiam:,\nAn examination of the testimony relied on by the defendants in this case has satisfied us that the learned court was right in discharging the rule to open the judgment. It is unnecessary to enter upon a detailed consideration of the testimony. It would require more time than we can command, and, in the end, it would serve no useful purpose.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by the defendants."}
