{"id": "870560", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nThe learned judge instructed the jury that the plaintiff must recover, if at all, on the testimony of Lowry and Harvey, the other witnesses being \u201c in a measure corroborative,\u201d but not sufficient to make out the case if those two did not do so.\nLowry testifies positively to the promise to pay, \u201c she promised that she would give Byron the money that fall,\u201d but he does not identify the debt. He not only fails, but distinctly declines to say how much it was, but says the plaintiff went and got a paper, and his mother said \u201c the money that was on the paper was all right.\u201d This paper is not produced, or accounted for, and without it the testimony amounts to nothing. It is not nearly so strong as that which was held insufficient in Landis v. Roth, 109 Pa. 621.\nHarvey also refers to the paper but fixes the amount at $320. But he does not make out any sufficient promise to pay. According to him, the decedent said, \u201c if she couldn\u2019t raise the money why he (the plaintiff) could have it out of the land.\u201d This was at most a conditional promise to pay when able, and the additional statement that if she was not able plaintiff could have it out of the laud, is not a promise but a remission of plaintiff to his legal rights for a recovery. In Lowry v. Robinson, 141 Pa. 189, the promise was to pay \u201c when he got ready \u201d and \u201c he said he didn\u2019t have the money just at present, but he intended to pay it when he had it,\u201d and this court said emphatically that \u201c a claim twice barred by the statute of limitations should have a better foundation.\u201d See also Linderman v. Pomeroy, 142 Pa. 168.\nNeither of these witnesses by himself makes out a positive promise to pay an identified debt, and without that plaintiff cannot recover, for even if a clear acknowledgment of the debt were made out, which it is not, the decedent being a married woman at the time of the alleged loan and the alleged promise, would not be bound by it: Kelly v. Eby, 141 Pa. 176.\nNor can the testimony of the two witnesses be combined to bring either of them up to the required standard. As our brother McCollum said in Patterson v. Neuer, 165 Pa. 66, if an acknowledgment \u201c does not appear in either of their conversations it cannot be inferred from both. In other words several insufficient acknowledgments will not constitute a sufficient-one.\u201d\nThe plaintiff\u2019s claim is brought forward under circumstances that raise every presumption against it. His alleged loan was made to his mother, a married woman at the time, and he waited twenty-five years and until she was dead before taking any steps to get payment. Parties who do this must understand that they will be held to strict proof of every step towards their claim. The plaintiff failed to make out his case, and the request for a binding instruction for the defendant should have been granted.\nJudgment reversed."}
