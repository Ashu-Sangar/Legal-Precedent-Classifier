Did \u201cmanifestation\u201d of the \u201cproperty damage\u201d to the St. Johns\u2019 dairy herd take place in late March 2006 when the cows were concurrently observed thrashing their heads about in their water bowls, refusing to drink, and giving dramatically less milk; rather than, as held by the trial court, in April 2004 based on a mere economic downturn from a decrease in milk production?\nb. Does \u201cmanifestation\u201d of \u201cproperty damage\u201d for purposes of triggering a commercial general liability insurance policy take place only after the injured party has the ability to ascertain the source of injury or damage is traceable to something out of the ordinary and usual course of events for which another may bear responsibility?\nc. Does the \u201cmultiple trigger\u201d theory of liability insurance coverage adopted by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in J.H. France Refractories Co. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 534 Pa. 29, 626 A.2d 502, 507 (1993), apply to cases presenting continuous, progressive \u201cproperty damage,\u201d so that all policies on the risk from exposure to the harmful condition through \u201cmanifestation\u201d of the injury are triggered?"}
