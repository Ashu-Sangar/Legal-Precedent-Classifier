Three youths, one readily identified by a bystander as Norman Lyons, were seen fleeing the scene of the crime, which occurred at approximately 2:50 p. m. In the course of their investigation that afternoon, the police talked to many young men in the neighborhood, including appellant, Daryl Roane, but all were released without being arrested. That evening, Norman Lyons was arrested and he made a statement to the police in which he admitted his involvement in the robbery and named appellant as the man who had pulled the trigger. The police thereupon went to the home where appellant, who was then sixteen years old, lived with his mother, Mrs. Roane. At approximately 10:40 p. m., they informed appellant and Mrs. Roane that appellant was under arrest and took him to the police station at 22nd and Hunting Park Avenue in Philadelphia. Before they left the Roane home, Mrs. Roane told the police that she would be following them to the station. However, when Mrs. Roane arrived at the police station, at approximately 11:00 p. m., Daryl and the arresting officers were nowhere to be seen. Mrs. Roane waited for over an hour, during which time she was given no information concerning the whereabouts of her son. At approximately 12:10 a. m., Mrs. Roane happened to notice her son, accompanied by a detective, proceeding to a water fountain in the hallway where Mrs. Roane had been sitting. Mrs. Roane attempted to talk with Daryl, but the opportunity was denied to her when the detective took appellant away to another interrogation room. Mrs. Roane inquired of the detective but received no answer. Since she had no idea where her son had been taken, she continued to wait. After another wait, for a period which Mrs. Roane estimated to have been approximately an hour, Mrs. Roane again saw the police taking her son across the hallway into another interrogation room. This time the door was left ajar, so Mrs. Roane, uninvited, entered. She asked the police for an opportunity to talk with Daryl to find out what had happened since his arrest. The police gave her permission, but urged her to speak up so that they could hear what she said. According to Mrs. Roane, however, her son was uncommunicative. Soon after, a police officer brought a typewriter into the room, and a detective began reading appellant his constitutional rights. When he came to appellant\u2019s right to have an attorney present before any statement was made, Mrs. Roane told the police that she wanted to obtain a lawyer for her son and she did not want any statement taken. Mrs. Roane\u2019s request was ignored, and the police began taking appellant\u2019s formal statement. When Mrs. Roane protested, one of the detectives in the room told her, \u201cLet him talk, maybe it will make him feel better.\u201d\nIt was during the taking of the formal statement that Mrs. Roane learned for the first time that Daryl had already orally confessed his involvement in the killing immediately after being told that Norman Lyons had implicated him.\nThe formal typewritten statement was concluded at approximately 5:55 a. m. Daryl signed the statement but his mother and sister (who had arrived in the middle of the interrogation) refused to sign because, as Mrs. Roane explained, they didn\u2019t \u201cwant him to make the statement.\u201d\nThe principal question presented in this appeal from Daryl\u2019s ten-to-twenty-year sentence, imposed after a jury had convicted him of second-degree murder, is whether Daryl\u2019s formal statement was properly admitted into evidence.\nAppellant argues that since his statement was obtained only by ignoring Mrs. Roane\u2019s request for counsel, it should have been suppressed. He first emphasizes the case of In Re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 41, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1451, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967), where, in discussing an accused juvenile\u2019s right to counsel, the United States Supreme Court said:\n\u201cWe conclude that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that in respect to proceedings to determine delinquency which may result in commitment to an institution in which the juvenile\u2019s freedom is curtailed, the child, and his parents must be notified of the child\u2019s right to be represented by counsel retained by them, or if they are unable to afford counsel, that counsel will be appointed to represent the child.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nIn Gault, supra, the court specifically dealt only with the adjudicatory stage, specifically refusing to deal with the role of a parent or guardian in the pretrial stage of the juvenile process. We hold only that when a parent specifically refuses to consent, the Commonwealth has a heavy burden to meet in establishing that the juvenile\u2019s waiver was a knowing and voluntary one.\nIn so holding, we are following the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in Gault, supra, where it went on to say, in discussing an accused juvenile\u2019s pretrial waiver of his privilege against self-incrimination:\n\u201c. . . We appreciate that special problems may arise with respect to waiver of the privilege [against self-incrimination] by or on behalf of children, and that there may well be some differences in technique \u2014but not in principle \u2014 depending upon the age of the child and the presence and competence of the parents. The participation of counsel will, of course, assist the police, Juvenile Courts and appellate tribunals in administering the privilege. If counsel is not present for some permissible reason when an admission is obtained, the greatest care must be taken to assure that the admission was voluntary, in the sense not only that it has not been coerc\u00e9d or suggested, but also that it is not the product of ignorance of rights, or of adolescent fantasy, fright or despair.\u201d At page 55, 87 S.Ct. at page 1459.\nAn important factor in establishing that a juvenile\u2019s waiver of his constitutional rights was a knowing and intelligent one would be evidence that, before he made his decision to waive those rights, he had access to the advice of a parent, attorney, or other adult who was primarily interested in his welfare. As the United States Supreme Court said in Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U.S. 49, 54-55, 82 S.Ct. 1209, 1213, 8 L.Ed.2d 325 (1962):\n\u201c[The juvenile defendant] cannot be compared with an adult in full possession of his senses and knowledgeable of the consequences of his admissions. He would have no way of knowing what the consequences of his confession were without advice as to his rights \u2014from someone concerned with securing him those rights \u2014 and without the aid of more mature judgment as to the steps he should take in the predicament in which he found himself. A lawyer or an adult relative or friend could have given the petitioner the protection which his own immaturity could not. Adult advice would have put him on a less unequal footing with his interrogators. Without some adult advice against this inequality, a 14 year old boy would not be able to know, let alone assert, such constitutional rights as he had. To allow this conviction to stand would, in effect, be to treat him as if he had no constitutional rights.\u201d\nIn Commonwealth v. Harmon, 440 Pa. 195, 269 A.2d 744 (1970), we held that a confession taken from a juvenile was properly suppressed upon evidence that his parent\u2019s repeated requests to be present during his interrogation were refused. The instant situation is in one way analogous to the facts in Harmon, supra.\nHere, Mrs. Roane informed the police at the time of Daryl\u2019s arrest that she would be following the police car to the station, thereby making it clear that she expected to be present during her son\u2019s interrogation. Rather than waiting for Mrs. Roane, the police ignored her. When she got to the station, no one helped her to locate her son. Even after she happened to spot him when he was brought out to a water fountain, the police ignored her presence and returned him to the interrogation room. It was only when he was moved to a second interrogation room, one hour later, and the door of that room was left ajar, that Mrs. Roane was finally able to gain access to the interrogation room.\nThe Commonwealth seems to contend that the fact that Mrs. Roane was excluded during the early periods of Daryl\u2019s interrogation should have no effect on the admissibility of his formal statement because Mrs. Roane finally did gain entrance, was present during a full reading of Daryl\u2019s rights, and still was unable to dissuade Daryl from making a full confession. However, in our view, Mrs. Roane\u2019s mere presence is not enough. In order to support a finding that Daryl\u2019s waiver of his rights was knowing and intelligent, we believe that the record must indicate that Mrs. Roane had an opportunity to give Daryl the kind of helpful advice discussed in Gallegos, supra. The instant case reveals no such opportunity. Instead, the record makes clear that at no time was Mrs. Roane permitted to talk with her son alone. Rather, when she did try to talk with Daryl, one officer intruded, asking her to speak up so that she and her son could be heard, and another tried to dissuade her from the advice she was attempting to give by urging her to \u201clet him talk, maybe it will make him feel better.\u201d\nSince the record indicates that the Commmonwealth first attempted to exclude appellant\u2019s mother from the interrogation and then, when she finally gained access, did not afford her an opportunity to advise her son privately about his constitutional rights, although she indicated that she wished him to be afforded the right of counsel, we hold that the Commonwealth failed to establish that appellant\u2019s waiver of his rights was a knowing and intelligent one. Accordingly, his confession should have been suppressed.\nJudgment of sentence reversed and case remanded for a new trial.\nEAGEN, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which JONES, C. J., and POMEROY, J., join.\nNIX, J., concurs in the result.\n. Daryl Roane was born February 8,1953."}
