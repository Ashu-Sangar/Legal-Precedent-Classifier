{"id": "3788320", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice NEWMAN.\nWe granted allocatur in this case to consider the extent to which courts can limit parents from advocating religious beliefs that, if acted upon, would constitute criminal conduct.\nFacts and Procedural History\nStanley M. Shepp (Father) and Tracey L. Shepp, a/k/a Tracey L. Roberts (Mother) married in June of 1992. They converted to the Mormon faith prior to their marriage. Their child, Kaylynne Marie Shepp (Kaylynne), whose custody is at issue in this case, was born on February 3, 1993. The parties separated in April of 2000, and they divorced in February of 2001. Shortly after the divorce, the Mormon Church excommunicated Father because he is a fundamentalist who believes in polygamy.\nFollowing the parties\u2019 separation, Kaylynne lived with Mother and her three other daughters from previous marriages. On January 2, 2002, Father filed a Petition seeking an order of shared legal and physical custody of Kaylynne. The trial court issued an Interim Order for Custody on January 30, 2002, which provided that the parties would share legal custody and that Mother would have primary physical custody. The Interim Order notes, \u201cFather\u2019s position is that he requests primary physical custody, although the Petition does indicate shared physical custody.\u201d Order dated January 30, 2002, at 3.\nThe trial court held a hearing on May 6, 2002. Father testified that he practices Mormon fundamentalism and the teachings of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. He further stated that fundamentalism \u201cincludes plural marriage.\u201d Notes of Testimony (N.T.), dated May 6, 2002, at 72. He testified that he has not set a limit on the number of wives he would like to have, but would have no problem with additional wives if they love his family and get along. Id. at 107. With respect to discussing plural marriage with Kaylynne, Father stated that he has told the child of the possibility that she could have another mother who comes into the family through plural marriage. Id. at 75. He indicated his belief that it is important for children to know, while they are young, about any lifestyle the family may practice, rather than to \u201call of a sudden pop something on them like that\u201d when they are seventeen. Id. When asked if he would try to marry Kaylynne into a polygamist relationship, he replied that he would not, but that in order for her to be happy, she has to have choices, and that as a father it is his job to help her learn about and understand alternatives. Id. at 77-78. Father\u2019s current wife testified that she accepts the idea of plural marriage and that she is comfortable with the idea of participating in a family with more than one mother. She stated that there are no plans at the present time for her marriage to become a plural marriage. Id. at 123.\nMother testified that Father\u2019s belief in polygamy was the reason for the parties\u2019 divorce. She stated that Father would like to have five wives, id. at 13, and expressed concerns that he would introduce Kaylynne to men so that she would be ready to engage in polygamy once she reaches the age of thirteen. Id. at 16. She stated that she did not wish her daughter to interact with polygamist families or \u201cto be taught polygamy in any way.\u201d Id.\nManda Lee (Manda), Mother\u2019s daughter from a previous marriage, testified that when she was thirteen years old, Father (who is her stepfather) told her \u201cthat if you didn\u2019t practice polygamy or you didn\u2019t agree with it, but mostly if you didn\u2019t practice it, that you were going to hell.\u201d Id. at 164. She further testified that Father told her that in Pennsylvania a fourteen-year old can get married with a parent\u2019s permission, and \u201csince I was already living in the house and we were already related, that it would be a good idea for us to be married.\u201d Id. at 165. On rebuttal, Father denied Manda\u2019s allegation that' he suggested they participate in a polygamous relationship. Id. at 175.\nAt the conclusi\u00f3n of the hearing, the trial court noted:\nContact [between a parent and a child] can be limited only when the parent has been shown to suffer from severe mental or moral deficiencies that constitute a grave threat to the child.\nWhile we may have evidence of moral deficiency of [F]ather because of his belief in having multiple wives, there has been no evidence of a grave threat to the child in this case.\nId. at 180. In its final Order, the court awarded joint legal custody to both parents, and primary physical custody to Mother. Noting that the parties had raised Kaylynne in the Mormon faith, the court directed, \u201cthe child will continue with that religious upbringing.\u201d Id. at 181. However, the court ordered, \u201cFather is specifically prohibited while the child is a minor from teaching her about polygamy, plural marriages or multiple wives.\u201d Id.\nFather filed a timely appeal to the Superior Court, which affirmed the decision of the trial court. However, the Superi- or Court disagreed with the conclusion of the trial court, stating, \u201c[t]he court\u2019s factual findings as to the nature of the practice endorsed by [Father] and as to [Father\u2019s] own character render its conclusion that [Father] poses no grave threat to his daughter both erroneous and unreasonable.\u201d Shepp v. Shepp, 821 A.2d 635, 638 (Pa.Super.2003). The Superior Court made this determination based on the following facts elicited during the testimony of Father\u2019s stepdaughter, which the trial court and the Superior Court deemed credible:\n[Father\u2019s] promotion of his beliefs to his stepdaughter involved not merely the superficial exposure of a child to the theoretical notion of criminal conduct, but constituted a vigorous attempt at moral suasion and recruitment by threats of future punishment. The child was, in fact, warned that only by committing an illicit act could she comply with the requirements of her religion.\nId. The court further expressed concern that Father\u2019s intention to inculcate a belief in polygamy in his own daughter \u201cmay perhaps, as the child matures, even become insistence that she engage in such conduct.\u201d Id. While recognizing the difference between discussion and coercion, the court held that the best interests of the child would be served by restricting Father from discussing polygamy with Kaylynne until she is eighteen years old.\nDiscussion\nThis case implicates two highly important values: the free exercise of religion as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and the public policy of this Commonwealth, as set forth in Section 5301 of the Domestic Relations Code, \u201cwhen in the best interest of the child, to assure a reasonable and continuing contact of the child with both parents after a separation or dissolution of the marriage and a sharing of the rights and responsibilities of child rearing by both parents.\u201d 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5301.\nThe essence of Father\u2019s position is that he is simply a parent who wishes to share his sincere religious beliefs with his child. In support of his view that the courts may not interfere with this right, he relies on Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972). In Yoder, the United States Supreme Court affirmed a decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, which held that the convictions of Amish parents for violating the State\u2019s compulsory school attendance law were invalid pursuant to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Although the relevant statute required that all children between the ages of seven and sixteen attend school, Yoder and other parents refused to send their children to school beyond the eighth grade. The United States Supreme Court recognized the importance of the State\u2019s interest in universal education, but nevertheless concluded that such interest \u201cis not totally free from a balancing process when it impinges on fundamental rights and interests, such as those specifically protected by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, and the traditional interest of parents with respect to the religious upbringing of their children.\u201d Id. at 214, 92 S.Ct. 1526. Furthermore, \u201conly those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise' of religion.\u201d Id. at 215, 92 S.Ct. 1526.\nBased on a review of the record, the United States Supreme Court noted that the Amish way of life, which the parents wished to maintain by prohibiting formal education beyond the eighth grade, was a matter of deep religious conviction. The Court stated:\n[T]he Court\u2019s holding in Pierce [v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) ] stands as a charter of the rights of parents to direct the religious upbringing of their children. And, when the interests of parenthood are combined with a free exercise claim of the nature revealed by this record, more than merely a \u2018reasonable relation to some purpose within the competency of the State\u2019 is required to sustain the validity of the State\u2019s requirement under the First Amendment.\nId. at 233, 92 S.Ct. 1526. Unchallenged expert testimony established that the \u201cenforcement of the State\u2019s requirement of compulsory formal education after the eighth grade would gravely endanger if not destroy the free exercise of respondents\u2019 religious beliefs.\u201d Id. at 219, 92 S.Ct. 1526. The United States Supreme Court determined that exposing Amish children to the worldly influences of secondary school \u201ccontravenes the basic religious tenets and practice of the Amish faith, both as to the parent and the child.\u201d Id. at 218, 92 S.Ct. 1526. The State maintained that its interest in compulsory education was \u201cso compelling that even the established religious practices of the Amish must give way.\u201d Id. at 221, 92 S.Ct. 1526. The Court disagreed, noting that \u201c[w]here fundamental claims of religious freedom are at stake ... we must searchingly examine the interests that the State seeks to promote____\u201d Id. Because the record established that persons who practice the Amish faith are able to fulfill their responsibilities of citizenship without compulsory education beyond the eighth grade, and receive vocational education that allows them to be self-reliant, the Court determined that Yoder had introduced \u201cpersuasive evidence undermining the arguments the State ha[d] advanced to support its claims in terms of the welfare of the child and society as a whole.\u201d Id. at 234, 92 S.Ct. 1526. The United States Supreme Court concluded by explaining that accommodating the religious objections of the Amish by foregoing an additional year or two of secondary education would not impair the health of the children or in any way harm society.\nIn the case sub judice, Father asserts that where the State interferes in matters of religious speech between parent and child, such action is subject to strict scrutiny, or a showing that a compelling governmental interest outweighs the fundamental right of a parent to make decisions concerning a child\u2019s upbringing.\nMother disagrees with Father\u2019s position that polygamy is a constitutionally protected practice within a religious context. In the nineteenth century, the United States Supreme Court issued four decisions in which it took a firm position against Mormon polygamy: Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. 145, 25 L.Ed. 244 (1878); Murphy v. Ramsey, 114 U.S. 15, 5 S.Ct. 747, 29 L.Ed. 47 (1885); Davis v. Beason, 133 U.S. 333, 10 S.Ct. 299, 33 L.Ed. 637 (1890); Late Corp. of the Church of Latter Day-Saints v. United States, 136 U.S. 1, 10 S.Ct. 792, 34 L.Ed. 478 (1890). See, Keith E. Sealing, Polygamists Out of the Closet: Statutory and State Constitutional Prohibitions Against Polygamy are Unconstitutional Under the Free Exercise Clause, 17 Ga. St. U.L.Rev. 691, 710-710 (2001). The Reynolds Court referred to polygamy as \u201codious among the northern and western nations of Europe.\u201d Reynolds, 98 U.S. at 164. The Late Corp. Court stated that Mormon polygamy is \u201ca crime against the laws, and abhorrent to the sentiments and feelings of the civilized world.\u201d 186 U.S. at 48, 10 S.Ct. 792. In Davis, the Court upheld a law in the territory of Idaho that required an individual registering to vote to swear or affirm, inter alia, that he was not a bigamist or a polygamist, was not a member of an order that practices bigamy or polygamy, and that he did not and would not counsel or advise others to commit bigamy or polygamy. The Court stated:\nBigamy and polygamy ... are crimes by the laws of the United States, and they are crimes by the laws of Idaho.... If they are crimes, then to teach, advise, and counsel their practice is to aid in their commission, and such teaching and counseling are themselves criminal, and proper subjects of punishment, as aiding and abetting crime are in all other cases.\nDavis, 133 U.S. at 341-42, 10 S.Ct. 299.\nPlural marriage is a crime in Pennsylvania. Section 4301 of the Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4301 provides:\n(a) Bigamy. \u2014 A married person is guilty of bigamy, a misdemeanor of the second degree, if he contracts or purports to \u25a0 contract another marriage, unless at the time of the subsequent marriage:\n(1) the actor believes that the prior spouse is dead;\n(2) the actor and the prior spouse have been living apart for two consecutive years throughout which the prior spouse was not known by the actor to be alive; or\n(3) a court has entered a judgment purporting to terminate or annul any prior disqualifying marriage, and the actor does not know that judgment to be invalid.\n(b) Other party to bigamous marriage. \u2014 A person is guilty of bigamy if he contracts or purports to contract marriage with another knowing that the other is thereby committing bigamy.\nIn the instant matter, the illegal nature of polygamy becomes important when determining the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to Father\u2019s free exercise claim. The decision of the United States Supreme Court in Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990) (Smith II), is critical to this issue. Alfred Smith (Smith) and Galen Black (Black) were fired from their employment with a private drug rehabilitation organization because they ingested peyote while participating in a religious ceremony of the Native American Church. Pursuant to the relevant Oregon statute, persons in possession of peyote are guilty of a felony. Smith and Black applied for unemployment compensation benefits, which the Employment Division denied because their employer had discharged them for work-related misconduct. The Oregon Court of Appeals reversed based on its conclusion that the denial of benefits violated the free exercise rights of Smith and Black as protected by the First Amendment. The Oregon Supreme Court affirmed, holding that the criminality of the use of peyote was irrelevant because the purpose of the misconduct provision, pursuant to which the Employment Division denied relief, was not to enforce criminal laws, but to preserve the financial stability of the unemployment compensation fund. The Oregon Supreme Court held that this purpose did not justify the burden that denial of compensation placed on the religious practice of Smith and Black. On appeal, Employment Division, Department of Human Re sources of Oregon v. Smith, 485 U.S. 660, 108 S.Ct. 1444, 99 L.Ed.2d 753 (1988) (Smith I), the United States Supreme Court held, \u201cif a State has prohibited through its criminal laws certain kinds of religiously motivated conduct without violating the First Amendment, it certainly follows that it may impose the lesser burden of denying unemployment compensation benefits to persons who engage in that conduct.\u201d Id. at 670, 108 S.Ct. 1444. However, because the Oregon Supreme Court had not determined whether an exception to the controlled substance law existed for the sacramental use of peyote, the United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded to the Oregon Supreme Court for further proceedings. On remand, the Oregon Supreme Court held that there was no sacramental use exception to the criminal statute. It then determined that the prohibition was invalid pursuant to the Free Exercise Clause and, accordingly, reaffirmed its previous ruling..\nThe Employment Division again sought certiorari, which the United States Supreme Court granted. The Court, in an Opinion by Justice Scalia, reversed, determining that the Sherberi test, which requires a compelling government interest, does not apply where the challenged State action that is claimed to inhibit the free exercise of religion is a generally applicable criminal law. The Court noted:\nThe government\u2019s ability to enforce generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful conduct, like its ability to carry out other aspects of public policy, \u2018cannot depend on measuring the effects of a governmental action on a religious objector\u2019s spiritual development.\u2019 To make an individual\u2019s obligation to obey such a law contingent upon the law\u2019s coincidence with his religious beliefs, except where the State\u2019s interest is \u201ccompelling\u201d \u2014 permitting him, by virtue of his beliefs, \u2018to become a law unto himself,\u2019 Reynolds v. United States, 98 U.S. at 167 \u2014 contradicts both constitutional tradition and common sense.\nSmith II, 494 U.S. at 885, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (internal citation omitted).\nLike the Oregon law prohibiting the use of peyote, the Pennsylvania statute prohibiting bigamy is a law of general application. Therefore, pursuant to Smith II, a neutral law criminalizing polygamy overrides a claim that such law places an improper limitation on the free exercise of religion. Based on Smith II, Mother asserts, \u201c[s]ince 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4301 is a valid and otherwise neutral law, it follows that the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has the right to enforce, regulate, and prohibit such conduct or speech that may be incidental to such conduct, whether it be the use of peyote, enforcement of social security taxes, or the practice of polygamy.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 14 (citation modified).\nSmith II further recognized:\nThe only decisions in which we have held that the First Amendment bars application of a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously motivated action have involved not the Free Exercise Clause alone, but the Free Exercise Clause in conjunction with other constitutional protections, such as freedom of speech and of the press ... or the right of parents, acknowledged in Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925), to direct the education of their children, see Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972)....\n494 U.S. at 881, 110 S.Ct. 1595. Justice Scalia referred to such claims as presenting \u201ca hybrid situation[,]\u201d id. at 882, 110 S.Ct. 1595 which is subject to strict scrutiny. Id. at 881 n. 1, 110 S.Ct. 1595 (reaffirming a higher level of scrutiny for cases involving a free exercise claim made in conjunction with other constitutional protections, such as the right of a parent to direct the upbringing and education of his child). The instant matter, combining free exercise claims with the fundamental right of parents to raise their children, is a hybrid case. As such, Smith II, which presents a \u201cfree exercise claim unconnected with any communicative activity or parental right;\u201d id., does not directly answer the question of whether a court may prohibit a parent from advocating religious beliefs, which, if acted upon, would constitute a crime.\nIn light of the fact that Smith II does not apply to hybrid cases, we must reject the position advanced by Mother that a court may prohibit a parent from discussing religious beliefs with a child solely because acting upon those beliefs would result in the commission of a crime. Instead, we believe that Yoder provides the appropriate standard by which to consider the issue before us. As previously noted, \u201conly those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion.\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215, 92 S.Ct. 1526. Based on the record before us, it is clear that the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in promoting compliance with the statute criminalizing bigamy is not an interest of the \u201chighest order\u201d that would supersede the interest of a parent in speaking to a child about a deeply held aspect of his faith. However, this does not end our inquiry because Yoder also provides:\nTo be sure, the power of the parent, even when linked to a free exercise claim, may be subject to limitation under Prince [v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944),] if it appears that parental decisions will jeopardize the health or safety of the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens.\nId. at 233-34, 92 S.Ct. 1526. Yoder recognized that government has an interest in protecting \u201cthe physical or mental health of the child.\u201d Id. at 230, 92 S.Ct. 1526. Applying strict scrutiny,\n\u201cThe Government may ... regulate the content of constitutionally protected speech in order to promote a compelling interest if it chooses the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest. We have recognized that there is a compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological well-being of minors.\u201d\nSable Communications of California v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 106 L.Ed.2d 98 (1989). The state\u2019s compelling interest to protect a child in any given case, however, is not triggered unless a court finds that a parent\u2019s speech is causing or will cause harm to a child\u2019s welfare. Cf. Denver Area Educational Telecommunications Consortium, Inc. v. F.C.C., 518 U.S. 727, 765-66, 116 S.Ct. 2374, 135 L.Ed.2d 888 (1996).\nIn the instant matter, the trial court determined that Father believed in polygamy, and that acting on that belief \u201cwould be not only illegal in Pennsylvania, but would also be immoral and illogical.\u201d N.T., May 6, 2002, at 179. The court noted that Father had approached his stepdaughter and \u201cinformed her that she would go to hell if she did not believe in polygamy,\u201d id. at 180, and that the stepdaughter recalled that Father \u201chad suggested that when she became of age, that they would perhaps be married.\u201d Id. Nevertheless, the trial court stated that there was, \u201cno evidence of a grave threat to the child in this case.\u201d Notes of Testimony, May 6, 2002 at 181. Engaging in speculation that Father\u2019s statements to his stepdaughter might lead to insistence that his own child engage in polygamy, the Superior Court improperly substituted its judgment for that of the trial court, and concluded that the teaching of plural marriage constituted a grave threat. In light of the fact that the trial court did not find a grave threat, it erred in restricting Father from teaching Kaylynne about polygamy.\nBy their very nature, decisions involving child custody must focus on the character and conduct of the individual parents and children involved. Accordingly, there may be instances where restricting a parent from teaching a child about a sincere religious belief involving illegal conduct is appropriate. However, we emphasize that the illegality of the proposed conduct on its own is not sufficient to warrant the restriction. Where, as in the instant matter, there is no finding that discussing such matters constitutes a grave threat of harm to the child, there is insufficient basis for the court to infringe on a parent\u2019s constitutionally protected right to speak to a child about religion as he or she sees fit.\nConclusion\nFor these reasons, we conclude that a court may prohibit a parent from advocating religious beliefs, which, if acted upon, would constitute a crime. However, pursuant to Yoder, it may do so only where it is established that advocating the prohibited conduct would jeopardize the physical or mental health or safety of the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens. Because such harm was not established in this case, there was no constitutional basis for the state\u2019s intrusion in the form of the trial court\u2019s Order placing a prohibition on Father\u2019s speech. That being the case, the second facet of the strict scrutiny test \u2014 whether the trial court\u2019s Order was narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling end \u2014 was not implicated. Accordingly, we reverse the Order of the Superior Court.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justice CASTILLE and SAYLOR join the opinion.\nFormer Justice NIGRO did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustice EAKIN files a concurring opinion.\nJustice BAER files a dissenting opinion.\n. The official name of the Mormon Church is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n. \u201c \u2018Mormon Fundamentalism\u2019 denotes the beliefs and practices of contemporaiy schismatic groups that claim to follow the teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith. The Fundamentalist movement began after the issuance of the Manifesto of 1890, which publicly declared an official end to plural marriage in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Fundamentalists held that God requires all \u2018true\u2019 believers to abide by the principle of polygamy, irrespective of Church mandate. ... The thread that binds all Fundamentalists together is their belief that the LDS Church has improperly changed doctrines and practices.\" Abstracted from J. Max Anderson, \"Fundamentalists\" in Encyclopedia of Mormonism, ed. Daniel H. Ludlow, 4 vols. (New York: Macmillan, 1992), 2:531-32. Abstract prepared by Brigham Young University Studies staff and interns at ht1p://ldsfaq.byu.edu/view. asp?q=316 (last visited January 19, 2006).\n. Father\u2019s testimony was as follows:\nQuestion: As part of your fundamentalist Mormon philosophy, would you try to marry off Kaylynne into a polygamist relationship?\nAnswer: There is no way. Kaylynne has the same agency that anybody has. I can\u2019t marry her off any more than I could marry off anybody.\nN.T. at 77-78. In his Dissenting Opinion, Mr. Justice Baer, purporting to correct this Court as to the facts, indicates that the trial court concluded that Father \" \u2018clearly would\u2019 seek to act and use his parental control to convince Child to act illegally and immorally. Id. at 709, 906 A.2d at 1176.\u201d In making this assertion, Mr. Justice Baer quotes two words from the Opinion of the trial court, i.e., \u201cclearly would.\u201d and then supplies his interpretation. However, these two words appear in a broader passage:\nWe have also taken into consideration character, conduct, and fitness.\nBoth of the parties seem to have adequate character, conduct, and fitness, with one exception, and that is the fact that father acknowledges a belief in polygamy. That belief, if he would follow through with it, would be not only illegal in Pennsylvania, it would be immoral and illogical.\nThe issue is not having such a belief, but his interest in pursuing this belief, which the testimony indicates that he clearly would.\nTrial Court Opinion at 5. Thus, facially, it is less than evident that the court intended to memorialize a finding that Father would coerce Kaylynne into practicing polygamy. Indeed, in context it appears more plausible that the court was discussing Father\u2019s own marital plans. Moreover, to the extent that there is any ambiguity, the trial court\u2019s subsequent pronouncement clarifies the point:\nWhile we may have evidence of moral deficiency of father because of his belief in having multiple wives, there has been no evidence of a grave threat to the child in this case.\nId. at 6. The conclusion that there has been no evidence of a grave threat to the child would be difficult to explain if the court had previously found that Father \"clearly would\u201d coerce Kaylynne into polygamy, a practice that it has already noted was \"illegal,\u201d \"immoral,\u201d and \"illogical.\u201d\n. Section 1304(b)(1) of the Marriage Law, 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1304(b)(1), provides, \"No marriage license may be issued if either of the applicants for a license is under 16 years of age unless the court decides that it is to the best interest of the applicant and authorizes the issuance of the license.\u201d\n. In Yoder, the United States Supreme Court referred to Sherbert v. Vemer, 374 U.S. 398, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963), in which the appellant, a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, was dismissed from her job because she refused to work on Saturday, which her religion considers the Sabbath. Unable to find employment that would not require her to work on Saturday, she sought unemployment compensation benefits. The South Carolina Employment Security Commission denied benefits because the appellant failed to accept suitable work when offered. The Court of Common Pleas for Spartan-burg County and the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Commission. The United States Supreme Court reversed. The Court effectively created a balancing test that any burden on the free exercise of the appellant\u2019s religion must be justified by a compelling state interest.\n. In Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620, 116 S.Ct. 1620, 134 L.Ed.2d 855 (1996), the United States Supreme Court stated:\nTo the extent Davis held that persons advocating a certain practice may be denied the right to vote, it is no longer good law. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969). To the extent, it held that the groups designated in the statute may be deprived of the right to vote because of their status, its ruling could not stand without surviving strict scrutiny, a most doubtful outcome.
