{"id": "1806031", "contents": "OPINION\nMcDermott, Justice.\nDennis Landis worked for Hershey Equipment Company for over three years. His job was to install and service poultry equipment in chicken houses, tasks which often placed him in enclosures abounding with chicken excrement. While so employed, Landis began to experience peculiar visual problems manifested by a distortion and loss of central vision in his right eye.\nAn ophthalmologist informed Landis that his sight was affected by a condition associated with his work environment. The specific diagnosis was \u201cpresumed ocular histoplasmosis,\u201d a rare disease the etiology of which is not clearly understood. Landis\u2019 ophthalmologist explained the working hypothesis of how the disease progresses as follows. There is a fungus called histoplasma which exists in soil and flourishes in accumulations of fowl excrement. The spores of this fungus become airborne and are inhaled by humans. In a small number of those persons so invaded, the presence of the histoplasma triggers an \u201callergic\u201d reaction in the host\u2019s eyes characterized by inflammation of the macular area, that part of the eye enabling clear central vision. This enhanced reaction to the histoplasma organism is designated \u201cpresumed ocular histoplasmosis.\u201d The doctor explained that the adjective \u201cpresumed\u201d is used \u201cbecause the organism which causes the reaction has never been found in the ocular tissue in patients that have had all the clinical findings of the syndrome;\u201d and that the designation \u201cpresumed ocular histoplasmosis\u201d is \u201cthe working hypothesis that this is the type of allergic reaction in the eye to the presence of the organism elsewhere in the body.\u201d\nIn the case of Mr. Landis the inflammation was accompanied by hemorrhaging and subsequent scarring that affected the central vision in his right eye. Though he could still perform his duties, Landis feared further damage to his eyesight and prudently chose to abandon his employ with Hershey Equipment. Unfortunately, this change came too late to prevent the permanent loss of central vision in his right eye. This loss prompted Landis to file a claim for benefits under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nThe referee who initially heard Landis\u2019 claim determined that a showing of an occupational disease within section 108(n) of the Act had not been made and denied the claim. Landis appealed to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, which affirmed the referee\u2019s decision with the added rationale that the claimant\u2019s medical expert had given equivocal testimony.\nOn appeal the Commonwealth Court reversed the Board\u2019s conclusion that the medical testimony was equivocal and further ruled that Landis had made an adequate showing to satisfy section 108(n). In support of that decision the court analyzed the testimony of Dr. Paul Nase, the claimant\u2019s ophthalmologist, and determined that it was sufficient as to the three required proofs of section 108(n), i.e., that Landis was exposed to presumed ocular histoplasmosis by reason of his employment with Hershey Equipment; that this disease was causally related to that employment; and that the incidence of this disease is substantially greater in the claimant\u2019s occupation at chicken houses than in the general population. Landis v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Hershey Equipment Corp.), 91 Pa.Cmwlth. 238, 496 A.2d 1324 (1985).\nUpon petition we granted allowance of appeal.\nAppellant\u2019s principal argument is that the Commonwealth Court erred in concluding that appellee had successfully carried his burden of proving that \u201cpresumed ocular histoplasmosis\u201d was \u201csubstantially greater in his industry\u201d than in the general population. See section 108(n)(3); 77 P.S. \u00a7 27.1(n)(3). We agree.\nAt the hearing, the claimant\u2019s physician offered the following limited testimony on this issue:\nQ. Doctor, to the best of your knowledge, is this histoplasmotic condition characterized \u2014 how would you characterize the rate of occurrence of this disease?\nA. I have no idea in this area.\nQ. In your opinion, Doctor, would an individual in an occupational capacity such as Mr. Landis, have a greater risk of exposure than say you or I?\nA. Yes.\nQ. Is there any information or knowledge as to how much a greater risk is available to him at the present time?\nA. Not to my knowledge.\nIn their opinion the Commonwealth Court glossed over this specific testimony and focused on the factors which tended to show that Mr. Landis contracted the disease at his work place. See Landis, 91 Pa.Cmwlth. at 245, 496 A.2d at 1327. Unfortunately, this analysis was incorrect.\nIn County of Allegheny v. Gallo, 49 Pa.Cmwlth. 506, 411 A.2d 877 (1980), the Commonwealth Court correctly interpreted section 108(n) as requiring \u201csomething more than a greater incidence of disease in a particular industry.\u201d Id. at 509, 411 A.2d at 878 (emphasis added). See Colt Industries v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 57 Pa.Cmwlth. 463, 426 A.2d 743 (1981). However, for whatever reason, the Commonwealth Court ignored this precedent and ordered recovery where claimant\u2019s evidence demonstrated nothing more than he had a \u201cgreater risk of exposure\u201d to the disease by virtue of his employment. This evidence was deficient in two critical aspects. First, the claimant\u2019s witness never qualified what he meant by \u201cgreater.\u201d A one percent increase in risk of exposure constitutes a greater risk, but it does not constitute \u201ca substantially greater\u201d risk as required by the statute. Secondly, \u201crisk of exposure\u201d is not the same as \u201cincidence of disease.\u201d The first description, which merely identifies potential, is in no way equal to the latter description, which identifies actual injuries attributable to the conditions of the workplace. The statute mandates proof of the latter.\nTherefore, we find that as a matter of law the Commonwealth Court was incorrect when it reversed the Board\u2019s determination that claimant had failed to show \u201cthat the incidence of the aforementioned disease is substantially greater in the claimant\u2019s occupation than in the general population.\u201d Opinion of Board, A-85276, p. 3. Our inquiry, however, is not at an end.\nRecently, we have established that a claimant whose injury is in the nature of an insidious \u201coccupational disease\u201d is not precluded from benefits merely because he does not fall within section 108. Pawlosky v. Workmen\u2019s Compen sation Appeal Board, 514 Pa. 450, 525 A.2d 1204 (1987). Such a claimant may still prove his claim by showing the existence of a work-related injury under section 301(c), 77 P.S. \u00a7 411. Neither the Board, nor the referee considered whether claimant\u2019s medical evidence was sufficient to show causation under the general injury section of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, section 301(c), 77 P.S. \u00a7 411. In addition, because at the time of Mr. Landis\u2019 claim the Board considered section 108(n) the exclusive means by which a claimant could recover for an unenumerated insidious disease neither of the parties presented their cases as a section 301(c) claim. Therefore, we think it is necessary to remand this to the Board for a new hearing at which time new evidence can be adduced concerning Mr. Landis\u2019 claimed injury.\nAccordingly, the Order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and this case is remanded to the Board for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nHUTCHINSON and PAPADAKOS, JJ., file dissenting opinions.\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, art. 1, \u00a7 101 et seq., as amended; 77 P.S. \u00a7 l et seq.\n. 77 P.S. \u00a7 27.1(n), which provides in relevant part:\nThe term \u201coccupational disease,\u201d as used in this act, shall mean only the following diseases.\n(n) All other diseases (1) to which the claimant is exposed by reason of his employment, and (2) which are causally related to the industry or occupation, and (3) the incidence of which is substantially greater in that industry or occupation than in the general population ..."}
