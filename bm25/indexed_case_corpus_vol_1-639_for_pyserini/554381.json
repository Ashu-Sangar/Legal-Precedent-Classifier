{"id": "554381", "contents": "Per Curiam :\nThe learned judge committed no error in entering judgment in favor of the plaintiff below, on the special verdict. The attempt was to assign that which had no existence, either substantial or incipient. There was no foundation or contract on which an indebtedness might arise. It was the mere possibility of a subsequent acquisition of property. This is too vague and uncertain. It cannot be sustained as a valid assignment and transfer of property: Jermyn v. Moffitt, 75 Penn. St. 402.\nJudgment affirmed."}
