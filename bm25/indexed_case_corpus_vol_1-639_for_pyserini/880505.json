{"id": "880505", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn view of the practically undisputed evidence in support of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, the learned trial judge was clearly right in withdrawing the case from the consideration of the jury and \u2022directing them to render a verdict in favor of the bank for the .amount of the mortgage debt with interest from November 29, 1891. There is no question in the case that requires discussion. The assignments of error are both dismissed, and the judgment is affirmed."}
