{"id": "8732764", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware County appointing David Van Dyke to serve as a co-trustee of a testamentary trust established by John Crozer. We agree with appellant, objecting beneficiary William Lober, that the appointment of Van Dyke is impermissible under the terms of the trust. Hence we reverse.\nI.\nSettlor Crozer died testate in 1926. In his will, Crozer created a trust for the benefit of family members, including his wife, his four daughters, his grandchildren, and his great grandchildren. The trust presently is active, and will remain so until the death of the last of Crozer\u2019s grandchildren who were living at his death.\nBy paragraph 11 of his will, Crozer provided:\n\u201cI do hereby nominate, constitute and appoint my beloved wife, Elizabeth W. Crozer, William I. Schaffer, of the Township of Haverford, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, John B. Hannum, Jr., of the Township of Middletown, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and Bank of North America & Trust Company, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania [(now First Pennsylvania Bank)], as the Trustees of the several trusts created in this, my last Will and Testament. In the event of the death, renunciation, refusal or inability of any of the said persons, so named as Trustees to act as such Trustees, then the rights, powers and duties hereby conferred or imposed upon said Trustees shall be exercised by the survivors or survivor of them.\u201d\nOf the named trustees, only appellee, the corporate fiduciary First Pennsylvania Bank, has continued to serve throughout the life of the trust. Elizabeth Crozer and William Schaffer resigned in 1938, and John Hannum died in 1942. On the death of Hannum, the Orphans\u2019 Court of Delaware County, without objection, appointed Jay Allen Hodge to serve with the corporate fiduciary. Hodge died in 1966. Since then, First Pennsylvania has served alone.\nIn August of 1977, upon the death of the last of settlor\u2019s daughters, First Pennsylvania filed a thirteenth account. Additionally, First Pennsylvania petitioned the orphans\u2019 court to appoint Van Dyke as co-trustee, at a rate of compensation of one per cent of trust income. First Pennsylvania expressed no willingness to accept a corresponding reduction of its compensation.\nVan Dyke, a great-grandchild of settlor and an income beneficiary of the trust, is employed by the brokerage firm of E. F. Hutton Company. At the time of First Pennsylvania\u2019s petition, Van Dyke was s\u00e9rving as broker of record for the trust. Thus any transactions made by the trustee were executed through E. F. Hutton, and Van Dyke received credit for the brokerage commissions.\nThe orphans\u2019 court held a hearing on the petition for appointment of Van Dyke as a co-trustee. Appellant Lober contended, as he contends here, that in paragraph 11 of settlor\u2019s will settlor expressed the intent that, as the various individual trustees ceased service, those trustees remaining would continue to serve, alone. According to appellant, this intent of settlor forecloses the appointment of new trustees unless the performance of the remaining trustee or trustees is inadequate. In appellant\u2019s view, First Pennsylvania has administered the trust adequately since it began to serve alone fifteen years ago. No party in interest argues to the contrary.\nThe orphans\u2019 court observed that First Pennsylvania\u2019s performance \u201chas been much more than adequate.\u201d It added that First Pennsylvania \u201chas handled this trust in excess of fifty years and it appears to the Court it has done an excellent job for that entire period of time,\u201d including those most recent years in which First Pennsylvania has served alone.\nNonetheless, the orphans\u2019 court granted First Pennsylvania\u2019s petition. In its opinion in support of the dismissal of appellant\u2019s exceptions, the orphans\u2019 court disagreed with appellant\u2019s interpretation of settlor\u2019s intent. According to the court, paragraph 11 of settlor\u2019s will is silent on the permissibility of appointments. Thus the orphans\u2019 court rejected appellant\u2019s contention that appointment is permissible only if First Pennsylvania is performing inadequately. Instead it applied a standard permitting appointment if \u201cconducive to the proper administration of the trust.\u201d According to the court, \u201cproper administration\u201d would be advanced here because Van Dyke, a family member and stock broker, \u201cwould be infusing direct input of the various family beneficiaries, as well as adding a second expert opinion with respect to investments.\u201d\nII.\nCritical, of course, is whether settlor has manifested an intention that new trustees should not be appointed as the number of named trustees diminishes. Both parties agree that if, as First Pennsylvania argues, settlor\u2019s intent is unascertainable, a new trustee may be appointed so long as the appointment is \u201cconducive to the proper administration of the trust. . . . \u201d Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 108 Comment b (Filling vacancies) (1959). See Stolzenbach Estate, 346 Pa. 74, 29 A.2d 6 (1942); II Scott on Trusts \u00a7 108.1 at p. 856 (3d ed. 1967). Both parties also agree that if, as appellant argues, settlor intended that new trustees not be named, a much more stringent standard must be applied. That standard would permit appointment of a new trustee only if the administration of the trust is in some respe'ct inadequate, or reasonably likely to become so. See LaRocca Trust, 419 Pa. 176, 213 A.2d 666 (1965); Restatement (Second) of Trusts, supra, at Comment e (Appointment of additional trustees).\nBy his clear language, settlor expressed his intention that the trust is to be administered by his named trustees and survivor trustees. Settlor deliberately made no provision for replacing those named trustees unable or unwilling to serve.\nIn paragraph 11, settlor specifically recognized the possibility of the named trustees\u2019 \u201cdeath\u201d or \u201crenunciation\u201d or \u201crefusal or inability\u201d to act as trustees before termination of the trust. In the event of any of these possibilities, settlor expressly directed that\n\u201cthe rights, powers and duties hereby conferred or imposed on said Trustees shall be exercised by the survivors or survivor of them.\u201d\nSettlor\u2019s express use of survivorship terminology makes set-tlor\u2019s intent clear, emphatic, and unambiguous \u2014 no new trustees are to replace those he named.. By providing that, as named trustees ceased to act, \u201csurvivors\u201d were to continue to serve the trust, settlor clearly expressed his wish that the number of trustees be allowed to diminish without the appointment of new trustees \u2014 even when, as here, one \u201csurvivor\u201d remains.\nThis conclusion is compelled by the fact that settlor has included among his named trustees First Pennsylvania, a corporate fiduciary with theoretically perpetual life. By assuring \u201ccontinuity of supervision,\u201d II Casner on Estate Planning 1161 (3d ed. 1961); see Cahen Estate, 483 Pa. 157, 394 A.2d 958, 963 (1979), settlor fully provided for the possibility that there could remain only one \u201csurvivor\u201d trustee.\nIn view of settlor\u2019s expressed intent to permit diminution of the number of trustees, the remaining question is whether the record supports the appointment of an additional trustee. Where, as here, the orphans\u2019 court, with full support on the record, has specifically determined that performance of the sole surviving fiduciary has been \u201cmuch more than adequate,\u201d it is clear that appointment of an additional trustee is unnecessary and inappropriate. See Badenhausen Estate, 38 Misc.2d 698, 237 N.Y.S.2d 928 (1963) (refusing to appoint additional trustee where existing trustee was merely \u201csemi-retired\u201d and did not desire sole responsibility for administering trust).\nThis record is far different from the record in LaRocca Trust, supra, where this Court approved the appointment of an additional trustee. There, the record revealed \u201cpast indications of failure to keep exacting records and . . . intra-family friction. . . . \u201d 419 Pa. at 180, 213 A.2d at 668. Unlike LaRocca, here appointment of an additional trustee would not serve to advance either the quality of the administration of the trust or any other valid equitable purpose. Rather, the appointment is contrary to settlor\u2019s expressed intent, and adds an unwarranted and unnecessary burden to the administration of the trust, which the orphans\u2019 court has found to be \u201cmore than adequate,\u201d indeed \u201cexcellent.\u201d\n\u201cThe identity and the number of trustees are a significant part of the structure of a trust.\u201d Badenhausen Estate, supra, 38 Misc.2d at 702, 237 N.Y.S.2d at 934. To give effect to settlor\u2019s express intention and the administrative structure which settlor erected here, the decree of the orphans\u2019 court must be reversed.\nDecree reversed. Costs on First Pennsylvania.\nSettlor has not manifested an intention that the number of trustees should be maintained.
