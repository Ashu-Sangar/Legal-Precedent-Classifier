{"id": "1802534", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nIn this case appellee attempts to attack the Parole Board\u2019s revocation of his parole through a Post Conviction Hearing Act petition filed in Allegheny County Common Pleas, the sentencing court. That court lacks jurisdiction over appeals from parole revocation, 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.17, and a Post Conviction Hearing Act proceeding is not an appropriate remedy for such matters. A parole revocation is neither a conviction nor a sentence, but an administrative proceeding. Bronson v. Commonwealth Board of Probation and Parole, 491 Pa. 549, 556-58, 421 A.2d 1021, 1024-25 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1085, 101 S.Ct. 1771, 68 L.Ed.2d 247 (1981). Parole questions are in the appellate jurisdiction of Commonwealth Court. Id.\nThe order of Superior Court is reversed and the order of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas dismissing appellee\u2019s Post Conviction Hearing Act petition is reinstated.\n. Act of August 6, 1941, P.L. 861, \u00a7 17 its amended."}
