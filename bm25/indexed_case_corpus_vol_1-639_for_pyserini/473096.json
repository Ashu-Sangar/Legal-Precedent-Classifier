{"id": "473096", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThis is an appeal from a decree of an orphans\u2019 court rejecting a claim against a decedent\u2019s estate based on the breach of an alleged oral contract of decedent to will claimant her entire estate. We agree with the learned court below that the evidence failed to establish a contract: Roberts Estate, 350 Pa. 467, 39 A. 2d 592; Cramer v. McKinney et al., Executors, 355 Pa. 202, 49 A. 2d 374. Even if a contract to will the whole or part of an estate had been proved, and a breach shown, the measure of damages is the value of the services rendered and not the estate promised to be given: Graham v. Graham\u2019s Executors, 34 Pa. 475; Neal\u2019s Executors v. Gilmore, 79 Pa. 421; Mary Kauss v. John Rohner, 172 Pa. 481, 33 A. 1016; Byrne\u2019s Estate, 122 Pa. Superior Ct. 413, 186 A. 187; Cramer v. McKinney et al., Executors, supra. No proof was submitted as to the extent of the service rendered and the value thereof.\nThe decree is affirmed at the cost of appellant."}
