{"id": "496940", "contents": "Mr. Justice Paxson\ndelivered the opinion of the court\nThe defendant did not appear upon the return day. On the day following the plaintiff filed his declaration, and at the same time signed judgment against the defendant by default for want of an appearance.\nThis was error. To entitle the plaintiff to a judgment by default under the Act of 1836, he must file his declaration before the return, day. Dennison v. Leech, 9 Barr 164; Foreman v. Schricon, 8 W. & S. 43 ; Black v. Johns, 18 P. F. S. 83. In. the case last cited it was held the defendant is not bound to appear until a declaration has been filed, and when none had been filed at the appointed time he had reason to think he would not be required to appear.\nIt is said, however, the judgment can be sustained under the rule of court. We do not think so. It is true the rule does provide that the plaintiff may have judgment by default \u201c without reference to the quarto die post, and irrespective of the fact as to whether the declaration be filed at the return day or not.\u201d This rule is in contravention of the Act of 1836. Buies of court are intended to facilitate the dispatch of business, but they cannot repeal an Act of Assembly. It is expressly declared by the 21 st section of the Act of 16th June 1836, P. L., 787, \u201c That such rules shall not be inconsistent with the constitution and laws of this commonwealth.\u201d And see Boas v. Nagle, 3 S. & R. 250. While the Act authorizes the' taking of judgments by default \u201c according to the rule? established by the court to regulate the practice in this respect,\u201d it does not empower the court to dispense with the filing of a declaration before the return day. On the contrary, it makes such filing a prerequisite to the signing of judgment.\nThe judgment is reversed and a procedendo awarded."}
