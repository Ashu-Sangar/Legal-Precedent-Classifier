{"id": "1725152", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant was indicted on counts of murder, voluntary-manslaughter, and carrying a firearm without a license. He was convicted by a jury of murder of the third degree and carrying a firearm without a license. The trial court granted a motion in arrest of judgment on the conviction of carrying a firearm without a license, but denied his post-trial motions regarding the murder conviction, and sentenced appellant to a term of ten to twenty years imprisonment.\nIn this appeal, appellant\u2019s sole contention is that he is entitled to a jury instruction that adequate provocation, necessary to reduce murder to manslaughter, can consist of the \u201ccumulative impact of a series of related events.\u201d Commonwealth v. McCusker, 448 Pa. 382, 389, 292 A.2d 286, 290 (1972). Although we agree that McCusker permits reliance on the cumulative impact of a series of related events to establish adequate provocation, here, unlike McCusker, there is no evidence which requires that the requested instruction be given.\nWhere there is evidence of a series of related events which tend to establish adequate provocation, the trial court should give the requested instruction. On this record, however, the trial court\u2019s decision to deny the instruction was not error.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nNIX, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp.1976)."}
