L. 550, \u00a71 et seq., 53 P.S. \u00a767501 et seq., the court below determined that the annexation of certain lands in West Mead Township, Crawford County, to the City of Meadville was in the public interest. This appeal from the order affirming the annexation questions the correctness of this determination.\nThe scope of our review in this matter is limited to ascertaining whether there is any evidence to support the lower court\u2019s finding that the annexation is in the public interest, and hence we are not permitted to substitute our judgment for that of the court below in the absence of a showing of an abus\u00e9 of discretion.
