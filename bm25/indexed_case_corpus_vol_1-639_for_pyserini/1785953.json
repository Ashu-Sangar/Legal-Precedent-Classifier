{"id": "1785953", "contents": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\nOn November 3, 1979, the appellee, Davico L. Cabeza, was convicted by a jury of first degree murder in the shooting death of Mrs. Helen Cook in a West Philadelphia Lounge. Following the denial of post trial motions, the court sentenced appellee to life imprisonment. Upon appeal from the judgment of sentence, a three judge panel of the Superior Court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The court decided that a new trial was required because during cross-examination of appellee\u2019s character witnesses, the prosecutor, over defense counsel\u2019s objections, was permitted, to pursue questions concerning two prior arrests of the appellee. Neither of the arrests about which the witnesses were interrogated had resulted in a conviction.\nIn reversing the judgment of sentence, the Superior Court relied on our holding in Commonwealth v. Scott, 496 Pa. 188, 436 A.2d 607 (1981), decided on November 5, 1981. In Scott we rejected the rule that allowed a prosecutor to cross-examine character witnesses as to mere arrests of the accused. Speaking for a unanimous court, then Chief Justice O\u2019Brien stated:\nUnder this rule which we abrogate, the cross-examination must have pertained to arrests which relate to the character trait vouched for on direct. McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 191, n. 14 (2d Ed.1972). Thus, the Commonwealth would have been permitted to ask appellant\u2019s character witness if they had heard that appellant had been arrested for assaulting his wife and on a weapons charge. Despite any cautionary instruction the court may have given the jury, the undue prejudice to appellant is obvious. On one hand, the jury would have heard that appellant had a reputation for being peaceful while on the other hand, the jury would also have heard that appellant had been arrested on two charges. Had appellant been convicted of the charges, it would be easier to say that he must suffer the consequences of placing his character at issue. But instantly, the arrests which would have been alluded to never resulted in convictions. Since an arrest is equally consistent with either guilt or innocence, the cases allowing such cross-examination are overruled.\nCommonwealth v. Scott, 496 Pa. at 196, 197, 436 A.2d at 611, 612.\nThe sole issue in this appeal is whether the rule announced in Commonwealth v. Scott, supra, should be applied retroactively to appellee\u2019s case which was pending on appeal at the time of the Scott decision.\nIn the present case, the appellee\u2019s only defense was his good character. He called four witnesses who offered testimony to that effect. During the cross-examination of two of the character witnesses, the prosecutor asked whether the witness ever heard that the appellee was arrested twice previous to the arrest for which he was then on trial. This line of inquiry was sanctioned by prior case law and the trial judge overruled appellee\u2019s objections. In his post trial motions and in his appeal to the Superior Court the appellee preserved and argued the issue of unfair and improper cross-examination of his character witnesses.\nThe appellant Commonwealth argues that appellee\u2019s trial was fairly conducted in accordance with the law then pertaining. Further, it is urged that the evidentiary rule established in Scott is not of constitutional dimensions and should not be applied to appellee\u2019s trial which occurred two years before the Scott decision.\nIn August v. Stasak, 492 Pa. 550, 424 A.2d 1328 (1981) we considered the question of retroactive application of an overruling decision in the environment of a civil case. The question in August was whether an insurance policy provision would be enforced in accordance with the approach which prevailed at the time of trial, or under a rule change announced while the appeal in August was pending. We said there that since no distinction could be drawn between the appellant in August and the injured litigant in the overruling case, the same relief should be available. Considering the similarity of the facts in August to those of the overruling case, we noted that August may well have been the case which set aside prior law if the overruling case had not been decided while August was pending on appeal.\n\u201c[0]ur rule in civil cases which applies the law in effect at the time of appellate decision applies with equal force to criminal proceedings.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Brown, 494 Pa. 380, 384, 431 A.2d 905, 907 (1981).\n\u201cEvenhanded decision making requires that similiarly situated individuals on direct appeal be treated the same.\u201d\nCommonwealth v. Brown, 494 Pa. at 385, 431 A.2d at 908.\nIn the present case, as in Scott, the lower court ruled that character witnesses could be cross-examined as to previous arrests of the accused which did not result in convictions. In both cases, a defense challenge to the ruling was raised during trial and the issue preserved and argued in post trial motions and on appeal. The only noteworthy difference between Scott and the appellee is that Scott was argued and decided first. The instant case may well have been the case which overruled prior law if Scott had not been decided while appellee\u2019s appeal to the Superior Court was pending. The question of whether to apply an enlightened rule in favor of a discredited one should not be determined by the fortuity of who first has his case decided by an appellate court.\nTherefore, we hold that where an appellate decision overrules prior law and announces a new principle, unless the decision specifically declares the ruling to be prospective only, the new rule is to be applied retroactively to cases where the issue in question is properly preserved at all stages of adjudication up to and including any direct appeal. Accordingly, the principle established in Scott is applicable here and appellee is entitled to a new trial.\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nNIX, McDERMOTT and HUTCHINSON, JJ., filed dissenting opinions.\n. Commonwealth v. Cabeza, 300 Pa.Super. 483, 446 A.2d 958 (1982).\n. The appellee, Davico L. Cabeza, had been arrested in 1973 for unlawful possession of drugs and in 1976 for aggravated assault and related offenses.\n. Scott was convicted of third degree murder and a violation of the Uniform Firearms Act. Prior to the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, defense counsel informed the court he intended to call various character witnesses who would testify as to the defendant's good reputation in the community. The defendant asked the court to prohibit the prosecutor from asking any of the witnesses on cross-examination whether he had heard anyone in the community mention that Scott had been arrested on two previous occasions. The trial court denied Scott\u2019s request and ruled that such questions would be permitted. As a result, the defendant did not call the proposed character witnesses.\n. Commonwealth v. Jenkins, 413 Pa. 606, 198 A.2d 497 (1964).\n. August involved an automobile insurance policy provision which required the insured to give prompt notice of any accident or loss to the insurer. This kind of provision was always interpreted to release an insurer of liability where notice was untimely. While August was on appeal, the case of Brakeman v. Potomac Insurance Co., 472 Pa. 66, 371 A.2d 193 (1977) was recorded. Brakeman held that untimely notice would release the insurance company only where prejudice was shown."}
