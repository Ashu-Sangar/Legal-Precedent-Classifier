{"id": "1815577", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nIn this appeal we are asked to address a very limited issue, whether the requirements set forth in \u00a7 10508 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 508, as amended, 53 P.S. \u00a7 10508 are mandatory. The facts are not in dispute.\nThe Appellee is the owner of a parcel of land which was part of a previously recorded subdivision plan. Because he wished to join together three of his lots into one, thereby dividing his undeveloped land into two lots, the Appellee was required to submit an application for subdivision plan approval to Butler Township, which in accordance with the Municipalities Planning Code and the Township ordinances, referred the matter to the Butler Township Planning Commission.\nAt the conclusion of the Planning Commission Hearing, Appellee was advised that the Commission would recommend approval to the Township subject to certain street paving requirements and the addition of five fire hydrants to the plan. The matter was then referred to the Township Commissioners for final approval. At the Commissioner\u2019s meeting, the Appellee, through his attorney, was advised that the submitted plan could not be approved until the Appellee agreed to build certain roadways to Township specifications. Because more information was requested, the matter was tabled to permit the Appellee additional time to comply with the Commissioners\u2019 request. After all of the requested information had been furnished, the plan was brought to a final vote and rejected. The written notice of the Commissioner\u2019s decision was as follows:\nAt their regular meeting on May 21, 1984, the Butler Township Board of Commissioners disapproved your request for a subdivision at the end of Campbell Avenue in Highfield, Butler, Pennsylvania.\nYour proposed plan does not meet the Township\u2019s specifications as they apply to roads and utilities. If the Commissioners were to approve the subdivision you have submitted, the Township would run the risk of installing these improvements.\n'\nIt is the Commissioners\u2019 decision that the Township\u2019s Ordinances must be uniformly applied to all persons and to make exceptions would not be in the best interest of Butler Township. Please contact me should you have any additional questions.\n(R. 196a).\nDissatisfied with the decision, the Appellee filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas and requested a hearing de novo. Immediately prior to the scheduled hearing, the Appellee\u2019s attorney raised the issue of \u201cdeemed approval\u201d under \u00a7 10508(3) for failure to comply with the requirements of \u00a7 10508(2). Appellant objected to the late submission of the \u201cdeemed approval\u201d issue. Notwithstanding, the trial court permitted testimony on that issue.\nAfter taking testimony, the trial court upheld the rejection of the subdivision application relying upon Appeal of Johnston, 69 Pa.Cmwlth. 220, 450 A.2d 785 (1982). A timely appeal was then filed with Commonwealth Court which reversed holding that the requirements of \u00a7 10508(2) were mandatory. 103 Pa.Cmwlth. 28, 519 A.2d 571. We granted Appellant\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal to review the application of \u00a7\u00a7 10508(2) and 10508(3) in light of the conflict between Appeal of Johnston, supra, and the case sub judice.\nThe legislature has embodied the proper procedure for obtaining subdivision approval in the Municipalities Planning Code. Specifically, \u00a7 10508 sets forth the necessary steps to be followed in processing a subdivision request. With respect to denying an application, \u00a7 10508 provides as follows:\n(2) When the application is not approved ... the decision shall specify the defects found in the application and describe the requirements which have not been met and shall, in each case, cite to the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon.\n(3) Failure of the governing body or agency to render a decision and communicate it to the applicant within the time and in the manner required herein shall be deemed an approval of the application ...\n(emphasis added). It is the interpretation of these two sections which has caused problems for the lower courts.\nIn Appeal of Johnston, supra, the Commonwealth Court carved out an exception to what appears to be an unambiguous provision. The Borough Council had failed in its letter rejecting the proposed subdivision plan to specify by ordinance section the areas in which the plan failed to comply with the ordinance. Commonwealth Court agreed that the Borough\u2019s non-compliance with \u00a7 10508(2) did not operate as an estoppel because the intended purpose of that section had not been defeated since the applicant was the Borough Mayor who presumably was aware of the reasons for the plan\u2019s rejection.\nBecause \u00a7 10508(2) is specific and unambiguous, we cannot agree with Commonwealth Court\u2019s interpretation as set forth in Appeal of Johnston, supra. The Statutory Construction Act, the Act of December 6, 1972, No. 290, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1501 et seq., sets forth the appropriate consideration in interpreting a statute:\nWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\n1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). Only if a statute is unclear may a court embark upon the task of ascertaining the intent of the legislature by reviewing the necessity-of the act, the object to be attained, circumstances under which it was enacted and the mischief to be remedied. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c).\nSection 10508(2) is quite clear, \u201c... the decision shall specify the defects ... and shall ... cite the provisions of the statute or ordinance relied upon.\u201d (emphasis added). Generally, words are construed to mean their common usage. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903. By definition, \u201cshall\u201d is mandatory. Accordingly, there is no latitude for overlooking the plain meaning of \u00a7 10508(2) to reach a more desired result.\nWhile we are cognizant of the harshness of the result in instances such as now before us, we cannot overlook the plain meaning of the statute to avoid a harsh result. To read an exception into \u00a7 10508(2), as the court did in Appeal of Johnston, supra, would eventually emasculate the rule itself. Ordinarily, an applicant is aware of the ordinance sections involved prior to submission of his plan. Therefore, in most cases, the applicant would have actual knowledge of the specific ordinances in question thereby negating the necessity for the rule. However, being aware of this fact, the legislature still adopted \u00a7\u00a7 10508(2) and 10508(3). Therefore, we will not amend the Municipalities Planning Code by grafting in such an exception.\nThe Order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nMcDERMOTT, J., dissents.\n. It is interesting to note that in Bensalem Township v. Blank, 115 Pa.Cmwlth. 281, 539 A.2d 948 (1988), Commonwealth Court has retracted from its rationale in Appeal of Johnston and now holds that the requirements of \u00a7 10508(2) are mandatory.\n. The Appellant also argues that the \"deemed approval\" issue was waived because it was not raised in the Appellee\u2019s notice of appeal filed in the Court of Common Pleas. Since the record reflects that the trial court was advised of the waiver argument and decided to hear evidence on this issue, the trial court apparently believed notice prior to trial was sufficient notice to preserve the issue. We find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court thereby finding no merit in this argument.\nAppellant also argues that if the Commonwealth Court decision remains, the plan will violate township ordinances. While this may be true, proper procedures may have been followed to prevent this occurrence. See, 53 P.S. \u00a7 11007. Since this precise issue has not\u2019 been addressed by either lower courts, we decline to address it until such time as it is properly before us."}
