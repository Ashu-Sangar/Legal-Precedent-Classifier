See Commonwealth v. Kane, 460 Pa. 582, 333 A.2d 925 (1975); Commonwealth v. Heckman, 404 Pa.Super. 335, 590 A.2d 1261 (1991); Commonwealth v. Martin, 346 Pa.Super. 129, 499 A.2d 344 (1985); Commonwealth v. Burkett, 300 Pa.Super. 72, 445 A.2d 1304 (1982). As the Opinion in Support of Reversal correctly points out, reasonable efforts must be made by PENNDOT to notify the driver of the action taken in removing his or her licensure. However, while it is admitted that what is reasonable may vary from case to case, the conclusion is drawn that by using first class mail delivery to serve notice, the department failed to act \u201creasonably\u201d in this instance.\nThat conclusion by the Opinion in Support of Reversal is extended no further than this case because appellant\u2019s most recent address was available. The operative assumption here is that had certified mail been employed to serve notice, the unclaimed return receipt would have alerted the department, and a search for further information could have been conducted. However, the availability of appellant\u2019s address information was serendipitous, due only to appellant\u2019s arrest, since he himself, in violation of a specific statutory directive, failed to inform the department of his whereabouts. Further, the department violated no precept of ours by using first class mail, since there is no authoritative definition of the requirements for acting reasonably to serve notice of license suspension, \u201cno statute, no regulation and no rule of court which requires it or any other governmental unit to serve its orders by certified mail.\u201d (Opinion in Support of Reversal at 7.) Therefore, even though in this case the lack of return receipt might have made the department aware that the notice was not received so that other action could be taken, the department, unlike appellant, was under no specific obligation to do otherwise than it did. Moreover, the Opinion in Support of Reversal fails to explain how the department was to know beforehand that its efforts would be unreasonable. Nor is it explained whether the same steps taken by the department would have been unreasonable had appellant\u2019s new address been unavailable.\nIn Commonwealth v. McDonough, 533 Pa. 283, 621 A.2d 569 (1993), the appellant also failed to supply the department with a changed address. The argument raised there, that the appellant was responsible for her difficulties with receipt of notice due to her own dereliction, is repeated here, and countered by the Opinion in Support of Reversal with a citation to Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 91 S.Ct. 1586, 29 L.Ed.2d 90 (1971). However, no amount of insistence on the importance of a driver\u2019s license, whether its possession is termed a right or a privilege, can cure the inability of any form of notice to reach a suspendee whose whereabouts are unknown. Rights and privileges, however essential, must be given some measure of protection by those who hold them, or they are lost. Fulfillment of a statutory duty to apprise the department of a change of address is not so onerous a protective measure for the right or privilege of driving that it cannot be required, especially of \u201cprudent, law-abiding citizens,\u201d McDonough at 291, 621 A.2d at 574 (Flaherty, J., Opinion in Support of Reversal).\nThe Opinion in Support of Reversal would have this case returned to the Commonwealth Court for the imprimatur of unreasonableness to be stamped upon the department\u2019s actions. Such a course would only reward appellant for his failure to comply with the law. The department is given no mandate for change, and the pattern may repeat itself at any time since exactly nothing will have been altered.\nGiven the repetitive nature of the problem involved here, maintenance of the status quo is objectionable, hence this Opinion in Support of Affirmance.\nNIX, C.J., and PAPADAKOS, J., join this Opinion in Support of Affirmance.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMANCE"}
