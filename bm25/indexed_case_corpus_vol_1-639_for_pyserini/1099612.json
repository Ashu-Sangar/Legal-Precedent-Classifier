{"id": "1099612", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nPlaintiff received an award from the workmen\u2019s compensation authorities, which was sustained by the court below, and the insurance carrier of defendant has appealed,\nThe referee found that an injury sustained by plaintiff on December 22, 1923, while in the performance of his duties as an employee of defendant, was the reason for \u201cthe lighting up of an old latent tuberculosis, causing it to reactivate and develop\u201d; and that this \u201cresulted in the total disability which has ensued.\u201d Appellant contends that plaintiff failed to produce evidence sufficient in law to uphold the conclusion that the complaint from which he suffers .and the disabled condition ensuing therefrom are the result of the injury alleged; but we-cannot sustain this contention.\nIn Vorbnoff v. Mesta Machine Co., 286 Pa. 199, 206, we recently said that, in this class of cases, an expert witness called by plaintiff \u201cwould have to testify, not that the condition of claimant'might have, or even probably did, come from the accident, but that, in his professional opinion, the result in question came from the cause alleged.\u201d It is sufficient to say, an examination of the record in the present case shows that the testimony, given by one, if not more, of plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses, measures up to the required standard.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
