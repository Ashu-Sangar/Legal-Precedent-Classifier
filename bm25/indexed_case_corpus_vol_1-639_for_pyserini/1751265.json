{"id": "1751265", "contents": "OPINION\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nThis appeal is from the order of the Commonwealth Court reversing the order of the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (Commission), and declaring unconstitutional that portion of Section 5(g) of The Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(g). Section 5(g) prohibits the publication of advertisements for employment expressing the race, color, religious creed, ancestry, age, sex, or national origin of the advertiser. Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Comm., Human Relations Commission, 31 Pa.Cmwlth. 218, 376 A.2d 263 (1977).\nThe circumstances surrounding this appeal are as follows. On March 15, 1975, the Commission charged the Pittsburgh Press Company (Press) with \u201cmaintainpng] a pattern and practice of aiding and abetting the doing of an unlawful discriminatory act\u201d in violation of Section 5(e) of The Pennsylvania Human Relations Act. According to the Commission, the Press violated Section 5(e) of the Act by publishing \u201csituation wanted\u201d advertisements alleged to be unlawful under Section 5(g) because the ads identified the advertiser\u2019s sex, race, religion, or age.\nThe Pittsburgh Press is a newspaper of general circulation throughout the greater Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The \u201csituation wanted\u201d section of the Press\u2019 classified advertisements provides a vehicle for persons seeking employment to describe themselves, their job qualifications, and the kind of employment they are seeking. The Press accepts and publishes these ads exactly as submitted by the advertisers.\nOn June 27, 1975, following an investigation from which the Commission determined that there was probable cause to credit the allegations contained in the complaint referred to above, the Commission issued a final order requiring the Press to cease and desist from publishing \u201csituation wanted\u201d advertisements, the contents of which are prohibited by Section 5(g).\nOn appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed the Commission\u2019s final order, and ruled that Sub-section 5(g) was unconstitutional. We granted the Commission\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal, and this appeal followed.\nThe Pennsylvania Human Relations Act, Act of October 27,1955, P.L. 744, \u00a7 1, as amended 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 951, et seq., establishes it as\n. . the public policy of this Commonwealth to foster the employment of all individuals in accordance with their fullest capacities regardless of their race, color, religious creed, ancestry, handicap or disability, use of guide dogs because of blindness of the user, age, sex, or national origin, and to safeguard their right to obtain and hold employment without such discrimination, to assure equal opportunities to all individuals and to safeguard their rights at places of public accommodation and to secure commercial housing regardless of race, color, religious creed, ancestry, sex, handicap or disability, use of guide dogs because of blindness of the user or national origin.\u201d\nTo further this public policy, Section 5 of the Act makes certain discriminatory employment practices unlawful. 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(a) through (j). Among other things, in 5(g), the Act makes it unlawful employment discrimination\n\u201c[f]or any individual seeking employment to publish or cause to be published any advertisement which specifies or in any manner expresses his race, color, religious creed, ancestry, age or national origin, or in any manner expresses a limitation or preference as to the race, color, religious creed, ancestry, age, sex or national origin of any prospective employer.\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 955(g).\nSection 5(e) also makes it unlawful\n\u201c[f]or any person, whether or not an employer, employment agency, labor organization or employe, to aid, abet, incite, compel or coerce the doing of any act declared by this section to be an unlawful discriminatory practice,\nThe Commission found that by accepting and presenting \u201csituation wanted\u201d advertisements which included references to the criteria declared unlawful by Section 5(g), the Press had \u201caided and abetted\u201d the unlawful employment practice proscribed by that section, the Press was therefore found to be in violation of Section 5(e).\nThe Commonwealth Court recognized that the advertisements which formed the basis of the Commission\u2019s complaint clearly violated Section 5(g):\n\u201cAn indication of the type of advertisement found by the Commission to violate Section 5(g) can be ascertained from the specific examples set forth in the Hearing Panel\u2019s findings of fact. These examples were drawn from stipulated exhibits which included the Press\u2019 \u2018Situation Wanted\u2019 columns from Sunday, June 1, 1975 to Thursday, June 26, 1975:\n\u2018COLLEGE GRAD \u2014 Born again Christian with Bachelor\u2019s Degree and seven yrs. sales and marketing mgmt. experience seeking work with Christian business or organization . . ..\u2019\n\u2018White woman \u2014 desires day work, office cleaning.\u2019\n\u2018Parolee \u2014 White needs employment to be released. Licensed steam boiler and engineer . . .\n\u2018Salesman \u2014 Age 30, looking for career in Pittsburgh, start immediately, 15 years sales experience . . .\n\u2018What can I do for you? Recent college grad, good looking, twenty-five years old, B.S. in Business Administration, seeks entry level management position.\u2019\n\u2018Man \u2014 mature, accounting, bookkeeping, office management, desires position in these or related fields.\u2019\nIt is obvious at a glance that the contents of these advertisements are in contravention of the letter of Section 5(g).\u201d\n(Footnotes omitted.) 31 Pa.Cmwlth. at 223, 376 A.2d at 265.\nThe Press did not contend otherwise before the Commonwealth Court, nor does it so contend here. The Press argues, however, that Section 5(g) unlawfully infringes on First Amendment rights. We agree with the Commonwealth Court that the advertiser\u2019s rights, as guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, are improperly restricted by the prohibition of Section 5(g). We therefore affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court.\nThe Press did not contend before the Commonwealth Court that the state may not prohibit discriminatory employment practices. It argued, however, that the restriction on freedom of expression contained in Section 5(g) is not necessary to promote that legitimate state objective. We agree with the Press that the Commission has not shown that the prior restraint of Section 5(g) is necessary to promote this legitimate state interest. The Commission argued that this case is controlled by Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973) (Press I). The Press argues that in light of more recent pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court, Press I is no longer viable law. We need not decide this point, however, because unlike the situation in Press I, what the Commission seeks to do in this case is to restrict the expression of the advertiser itself, rather than to restrict the unlawful activity of employment discrimination. While it held that legitimate regulation of an unlawful activity may incidentally effect an advertiser\u2019s right to freedom of expression, Press I does not stand for the proposition that prior restraint may be imposed on commercial speech even though that speech does not propose an illegal transaction.\nThe United States Supreme Court has, of course, said that it is permissible to regulate commercial advertising in some ways: \u201c[advertising that is false, deceptive, or misleading ... is subject to restraint\u201d Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 383, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 2708, 53 L.Ed.2d 810, 835 (1977); Virginia Pharmacy Board v. Virginia Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976); as is purely commercial advertising concerning transactions that are themselves illegal, Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, supra; Press I, supra. Similarly, reasonable restrictions may be placed upon the time, place, and manner, of advertising Virginia Pharmacy Board, supra; and special restrictions may be allowable with regard to advertising on the electronic broadcast media, cf. Capital Broadcasting Co. v. Mitchell, 333 F.Supp. 582 (D.C.1971), aff\u2019d sub nom. Capital Broadcasting Co. v. Acting Attorney General, 405 U.S. 1000, 92 S.Ct. 1289, 31 L.Ed.2d 472 (1972).\nThe restriction imposed by Section 5(g), however, goes directly to the advertiser\u2019s right to freely express his or her job qualifications, abilities, personal experience, or educational history. In Press I, the employer\u2019s placement of \u201cHelp-wanted\u201d containing sex preference designations constituted an act of illegal sex discrimination in the hiring of personnel. As a result, the Supreme Court said in Press I, that\n\u201c[a]ny First Amendment interest which might be served by advertising an ordinary commercial proposal and which might arguably outweigh the governmental interest supporting the regulation is altogether absent when the commercial activity itself is illegal and the restriction on advertising is incidental to a valid limitation on economic activity.\u201d 413 U.S. at 389, 93 S.Ct. at 2561, 37 L.Ed.2d at 679.\nIn contrast to the advertising employer\u2019s illegal, sex-based, employment discrimination in Press I, in the instant case the advertisers are prospective employees proposing commercial transactions \u2014 their own employment \u2014 which are not illegal. By its terms, the Act applies to employers, and those who aid and abet employers to practice employment discrimination. In Press I the Act clearly proscribed the underlying activity \u2014 sex based discrimination by the employer \u2014 and by providing sex-designated Help-wanted columns in its classified advertising section, the Press directly aided and abetted such employers\u2019 practice of sex based employment discrimination. Indeed, the Press did not challenge the illegality of the underlying acts in Press I. In the present case, the \u201csituation wanted\u201d ads proposed no illegal transactions, they simply ask that prospective employers hire the respective individual advertisers. The prospective employees\u2019 use of prohibited employment criteria in an advertisement cannot reasonably be said to aid an employer who might be predisposed to utilize such forbidden criteria. Knowledge of such forbidden criteria \u2014 age, sex, race, color, etc., \u2014 is readily obtainable by the employer simply by scheduling a pre-employment interview, or by requesting submission of an employment resume. Any effect that enforcement of Section 5(g) might have on reducing employment discrimination made illegal by Section 5(e) is thus too speculative to justify Section 5(g)\u2019s direct restriction on the advertiser\u2019s freedom of expression.\nAs was stated by the United States Supreme Court in Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro, 431 U.S. 85, 92 fn. 6, 97 S.Ct. 1614, 1618, fn. 6, 52 L.Ed.2d 155, 161 fn. 6 (1977):\n\u201cAfter Virginia Pharmacy Bd. [v. Virginia Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976)] it is clear that commercial speech cannot be banned because of an unsubstantiated belief that its impact is detrimental.\u201d\nIn Linmark, the record failed to support the township\u2019s assumption that proscribing the placement of \u201cfor sale\u201d signs in front of township homes would reduce public awareness of realty sales and thereby decrease public concern over selling. Likewise, in the instant case, the record fails to establish the statutory assumption contained in 5(g) that because of the revelation of supposed illegal employment criteria contained in the prohibited \u201csituation wanted\u201d ads, employers would be more likely to base their hiring decisions on such illegal criteria.\nOrder of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nPOMEROY, former J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion."}
