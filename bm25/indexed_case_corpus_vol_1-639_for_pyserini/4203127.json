{"id": "4203127", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 28th day April, 2011, after review, we find that the PCRA court\u2019s 10-page opinion provides an insufficient basis for our review, and further find that the PCRA court erred by denying a request for her recusal. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the PCRA court for appointment of a new PCRA judge who shall prepare a fully developed opinion on all of the parties\u2019 claims, and may hold an evidentiary hearing or grant any other relief deemed necessary.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s Application for Leave to File Post-Submission Communication, is granted.\nJurisdiction relinquished; case remanded.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justice EAKIN, and Mesdames TODD and ORIE MELVIN join the per curiam order.\nJustice BAER files a concurring statement in which Justice McCAFFERY and Madame Justice ORIE MELVIN join.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring and dissenting statement.\n. Appellant has filed a letter indicating he does not oppose the Commonwealth\u2019s Motion.\n. To that end, I respectfully differ from my esteemed colleague, Mr. Justice Saylor, who calls for a mandatory hearing upon remand."}
