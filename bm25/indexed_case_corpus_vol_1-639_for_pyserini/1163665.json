{"id": "1163665", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe order of the court below granting a new trial is affirmed upon the opinion of Judge Grafe, specially presiding. The trial judge\u2019s direction of a verdict in favor of plaintiff was obviously based upon the misconception of the import of a sentence in the opinion of Mr. Justice Schaffer when this case was previously before us in 1933 (313 Pa. 430). It was also based upon a misunderstanding of the rule we laid down in Watkins v. Prudential Ins. Co., 315 Pa. 497, 173 A. 644. We there distinctly pointed out that in an action on an insurane\u00e9 policy where the insured came to his death \u201cthrough external, violent and accidental means\u201d and where the defense is suicide, that the burden to prove all the operative facts by a fair preponderance of the evidence rests upon the plaintiff, that the necessary proof-element of accidental death is not supplied, prima facie, by the so-called \u201cpresumption against suicide,\u201d that what is often thus miscalled \u201ca presumption against suicide\u201d is not a legal presumption binding on the jury prima facie till disproved nor is it a probative fact but it is for the jury a merely permissible consideration of the nonprobability of death by suicide; it is not evidence and must not be substituted for evidence.\nOrder affirmed."}
