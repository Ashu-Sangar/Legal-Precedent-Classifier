{"id": "1725167", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from a decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Venango County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, dismissing appellant Mae Phillips\u2019s preliminary objections to (1) a petition filed by the executors of her husband\u2019s estate seeking the appointment of a guardian for appellant on the ground that she is incompetent (appeal No. 19); and (2) a petition filed by the executors of her husband\u2019s estate to set aside appellant\u2019s election to take against her husband\u2019s will, and depose and medically examine her (appeal No. 20). Appellant asserts that the trial court has neither personal nor subject matter jurisdiction.\nOrdinarily the dismissal of preliminary objections is an interlocutory order which is not appealable. Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202 (Supp. 1976) ; Pa.R.App.P. 311(a) ; Levy\u2019s Estate, 307 Pa. 522, 161 A. 740 (1932). The Act of May 5, 1925, P.L. 23, \u00a7 1, 12 P.S. \u00a7 672 (1953), provides that appeals may be taken from interlocutory orders in cases in law or in equity involving questions of jurisdiction. We have held, however, that this statute does not apply to proceedings in the orphans\u2019 court. Estate of Arthur Hahn, 471 Pa. 249, 369 A.2d 1290 (1977); Estate of Shelley, 463 Pa. 430, 345 A.2d 596 (1975); Wormley Estate, 359 Pa. 295, 59 A.2d 98 (1948); Heinz Estate, 313 Pa. 6, 169 A. 365 (1933).\nAppellant asserts that she is entitled to this appeal as a matter of right, relying on 12 P.S. \u00a7 672 (1953). Because this statute does not apply to orphans\u2019 court proceedings and because appellant has not petitioned for permission to appeal from an interlocutory order, the appeal is not properly before us and must be quashed.\nAppeals at No. 19 and No. 20 are quashed. Costs on appellants.\nNIX, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. \u201cWherever in any proceeding at law Or in equity the question of jurisdiction over the defendant or the cause of action is brought is raised in the court of the first instance, it shall be preliminarily determined by the court upon the pleadings or with depositions as the case may require, and the decision may be appealed to the Supreme Court or the Superior Court, as in cases of final judgments.\u201d\nAct of May 5, 1925, P.L. 23, \u00a7 1, 12 P.S. \u00a7 672 (1953).\n. Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. V, \u00a7 501(b), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.501(b); see also Pa.R.App P. 312."}
