L. 872, 18 P.S. \u00a7\u00a74718-4719. A prison sentence was imposed and Jackson filed an appeal therefrom in the Superior Court. Because other appeals were then pending in this Court involving the identical issue, the Superior Court certified Jackson\u2019s appeal here.\nThe conviction and judgment of sentence must be reversed. See Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 93 S. Ct. 705 (1973), and Commonwealth v. Page, 451 Pa. 331, 303 A. 2d 215 (1973).\nIt is so ordered.\nThe trial court stayed execution of the sentence pending appeal."}
