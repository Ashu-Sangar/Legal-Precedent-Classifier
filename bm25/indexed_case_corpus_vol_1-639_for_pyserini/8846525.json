{"id": "8846525", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn this suit to recover damages for injuries sustained by the minor plaintiff, when the automobile in which she was riding with defendant Joseph Hosaj collided with a car driven by defendant Dunn, an examination of the record shows that the questions involved were clearly for the jury and were correctly submitted by the court below. We find no error in the court\u2019s refusal of appellant\u2019s motion for judgment n. o. v. and a new trial.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
