Rep. 326, the parties to the record being the same as in the present case, we made a decree reversing the decree of the court below, and directing the record to be remitted with instructions to distribute the fund in the hands of the trustees in accordance with the opinion filed in those cases.\nThe present appeal, taken by B.

For the reasons and upon the considerations stated in the former opinion we make the same decree as was there made.\nThe decree of the court below is reversed at the cost of the appellees, and the record is remitted with instructions to distribute the fund in the hands of the trustees in accordance with the opinion already filed."}
