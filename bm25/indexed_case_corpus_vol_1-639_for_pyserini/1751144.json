{"id": "1751144", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, William Westly Hagans, was convicted of two counts of robbery and one count of criminal conspiracy in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia. He was sentenced to five to ten years in prison for each count of robbery, the sentences to run concurrently. Sentence on the conspiracy conviction was suspended. The Superior Court affirmed the judgments of sentence. Commonwealth v. Hagans, 241 Pa.Super. 575, 360 A.2d 670 (1976). We granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s evidence shows that appellant along with his brother, Edward, and one Samuel Williamson, robbed the home of Shirley Lofton in Philadelphia the evening of December 24,1974. Lofton was in her home with several friends, including Charles Reed and Samuel Edwards. The doorbell rang and Lofton sent Reed to answer it. William Hagans, Edward Hagans and Samuel Williamson entered and forced everyone to lie down on the living room floor, taking money and cigarettes from the victims. They then took Edwards\u2019 car keys and used his car to flee the scene.\nAppellant first argues that he is entitled to a discharge for failure to bring him to trial within one hundred eighty (180) days after the filing of the complaint, as required by Pa.R.Crim.P. 1100. Appellant also claims that he is entitled- to a new trial because the trial court denied a motion for severance. The motion was made because the Commonwealth proposed to introduce a confession by Edward Hagans, appellant\u2019s brother. Neither of these claims was presented in written post-verdict motions nor in briefs in the trial court. They were presented orally and ruled on by the court at the time of argument on post-verdict motions. We find that to be insufficient to preserve the issues for review.\nThis case is controlled by Commonwealth v. Waters, 477 Pa. 430, 384 A.2d 234 (1978). The facts of this case parallel those in Waters. Here, post-verdict motions were filed on October 23, 1975, ten months after our decision in Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975), while in Waters the post-verdict motions were filed on September 17, 1975, nine months after Blair.\nIn this case, as in Waters, defense counsel did not file any amended written motions, but rather presented oral arguments in support of issues not raised in the previously filed written motions. The oral motions were considered and decided by the court.\nIn Waters, supra, 477 Pa. at 432-33, 384 A.2d 234, this court, in explaining its decision in Blair, stated:\n\u201cIn Blair, this Court announced that it expected strict compliance with that provision of Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 1123(a) which required that \u2018only those issues raised and the grounds relied upon in the [post-verdict] motions may be argued.\u2019 To enforce this mandate, we directed that trial courts and appellate courts decline to consider claims that were not specifically set forth in the written post-trial motions.\n\u201cAppellant\u2019s written post-trial motions were boiler plate challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence. Although counsel apparently made more specific oral motions that were considered by the court, the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure, Rule 1123(a), 19 P.S. Appendix, requires written post-trial motions.\n\u201cThe practice in some judicial districts of ignoring the requirements of Rule 1123(a) is condemned. Henceforth, issues not presented in compliance with the rule will not be considered by our trial and appellate courts. Commonwealth v. Blair, supra, 460 Pa. at 33, n.1, 331 A.2d at 214, n.1.\u201d\nAny issue not presented in compliance with Blair and Pa.R. Crim.P. 1123 is not preserved for appellate review.\nThe only issue that has been preserved for appellate review concerns a motion for mistrial related to Edward Hagans\u2019 confession. In his opening statement, the district attorney told the jury that a detective would testify about a confession by one of the defendants, but he did not specify which defendant. During the trial, the court ruled that the confession was inadmissible. Counsel then moved for a mistrial, arguing that the prosecutor\u2019s statement irreparably prejudiced defendants and denied their right of confrontation. The motion was denied. Counsel did not request a curative instruction referring to the confession because of a belief that it would prejudice defendants by calling attention to the confession. Without referring to the confession, the court said in its closing charge that the jury was to consider only the sworn testimony and not the statements of the attorneys. We find that appellant was not entitled to a mistrial.\nThis case is similar to Frazier v. Cupp, 394 U.S. 731, 89 S.Ct. 1420, 22 L.Ed.2d 684 (1969), where a murder defendant\u2019s co-conspirator pleaded guilty. The prosecutor informed the jury that the co-conspirator would testify, and referred to the expected testimony in his opening statement. When called, the co-conspirator asserted his privilege against self-incrimination and was excused. The jury was instructed to disregard the prosecutor\u2019s statement.\nIn Frazier, supra at 735-36, 89 S.Ct. at 1423, the Supreme Court stated:\n\u201c. . .As the Court said in Bruton v. U. S., 391 U.S. 123 at 135, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, \u2018Not every admission of inadmissible hearsay or other evidence can be considered to be reversible error unavoidable through limiting instructions; instances occur in almost every trial where inadmissible evidence creeps in, usually inadvertently.\u2019 See Hopt v. Utah, 120 U.S. 430, 438, 7 S.Ct. 614, 30 L.Ed. 708 (1887). It may be that some remarks included in an opening or closing statement could be so prejudicial that a finding of error, or even constitutional error, would be unavoidable. But here we have no more than an objective summary of evidence which the prosecutor reasonably expected to produce. Many things might happen during the course of the trial which would prevent the presentation of all the evidence described in advance. Certainly not every variance between the advance description and the actual presentation constitutes reversible error, when a proper limiting instruction has been given. Even if it is unreasonable to assume that a jury can disregard a coconspirator\u2019s statement when introduced against one of two joint defendants, it does not seem at all remarkable to assume that the jury will ordinarily be able to limit its consideration to the evidence introduced during the trial. At least where the anticipated and unproduced, evidence is not touted to the jury as a crucial part of the prosecution\u2019s ease, \u2018it is hard for us to imagine that the minds of the jurors would be so inf\u00eduenced by such incidental statements during this long tidal that they would not appraise the evidence objectively and dispassionately. \u2019 United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U.S. 150, 239, 60 S.Ct. 811, 84 L.Ed. 1129 (1940).\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nThe Supreme Court held that the curative instruction was sufficient to protect the defendant\u2019s rights because the prosecutor reasonably expected the co-conspirator to testify and the expected testimony was not emphasized as an important part of the case. See Commonwealth v. Fultz, 478 Pa. 207, 386 A.2d 513 (1978). In the instant case, the prosecutor did not give great emphasis to the confession he intended to offer. The Commonwealth relied primarily on the testimony of the victims, which was clearly sufficient to support the verdict. The prosecutor\u2019s statement entitled the defense to a curative instruction at most. See Frazier v. Cupp, supra. Since no such instruction was requested, appellant cannot now argue that the court erred in failing to grant a mistrial.\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.\nPOMEROY, former J., took no part in the decision of this case.\nMANDERINO, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. All of the above individuals were tried in a joint trial."}
