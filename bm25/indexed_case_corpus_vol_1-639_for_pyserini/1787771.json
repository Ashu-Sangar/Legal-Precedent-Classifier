{"id": "1787771", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court which reversed an order of the Pennsylvania State Police Commissioner dismissing the appellee, Forrest M. Swaydis, from employment as a trooper. Commonwealth Court ordered that Swaydis be reinstated, and awarded back pay from the date of his suspension. The Commissioner\u2019s order of dismissal was issued after a court martial board determined that Swaydis had engaged in improper conduct.\nThe sole issue on appeal concerns the manner in which the court martial proceeding was instituted, to wit whether the proceeding was void ab initio as a result of an alleged failure by the Commissioner to adequately comply with Section 205 of the Administrative Code which governs commencement of court martial proceedings. Section 205 of the Code provides:\nNo enlisted member of the Pennsylvania State Police shall be dismissed from service or reduced in rank except by action of a court marital board held upon the recommendation of the Commissioner of the Pennsylvania State Police and the Governor.\n71 Pa.S.A. \u00a7 65(e) (1963-1982 Supp.). To secure the recommendation of the Governor that Swaydis be court martialed, as this provision requires, the Commissioner sent a memorandum to the Governor requesting that court martial proceedings be convened. The memorandum, dated November 26, 1980, stated:\nTrooper Swaydis did open a checking account at the First Bank of Greater Pittston, Dupont, Pennsylvania under a fictitious name and address. He wrote checks to the Bank of Pennsylvania under the fictitious name, knowing there were insufficient funds in said account. Trooper Swaydis borrowed money from three (3) individuals and did not repay the loans; withdrew $4,300 from his savings account in the Bank of Pennsylvania, knowing there were no legitimate funds in that account; established a residence under an alias since July 12, 1980; traveled out of his patrol zone to the Bank of Pennsylvania without permission of his supervisor; and conducted personal business on several occasions while in uniform and using an official vehicle. The aforementioned constitutes violations of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code Section 4101 A-2 (Forgery) and Section 3922 A-l (Theft by Deception). In addition to the aforementioned criminal charges, these actions constitute violations of the Pennsylvania State Police Field Regulations ... [Unbecoming Conduct; Conformance to Laws; Payment of Debts; Lawful Orders; Use of Vehicles].\nSubsequently, on December 2, 1980, a district magistrate dismissed the criminal charges against Swaydis on grounds that the Commonwealth had failed to establish a prima facie case. On December 23, 1980, the Governor issued a recommendation that court martial proceedings against Swaydis be convened. It is undisputed that when the Governor made this recommendation he had not been notified that the criminal charges against Swaydis, which had been referred to in the memorandum, had been dismissed.\nSwaydis contends that the Commissioner had a duty to notify the Governor of the dismissal of criminal charges, prior to the Governor\u2019s making a decision as to whether to recommend a court martial, and that the Commissioner\u2019s failure to have provided such notice rendered the court martial proceeding void ab initio. We disagree. It is well established that resolution of criminal charges in favor of a criminal defendant does not bar subsequent civil or administrative proceedings concerning the same underlying misconduct.

Commonwealth, Liquor Control Board, 480 Pa. 322, 326, 390 A.2d 163, 164-165 (1978) (administrative sanctions imposed upon a liquor licensee following dismissal of criminal charges). As stated in Wilson v. Wilson, 100 Pa.Super. 451, 458 (1931),\n[A] judgment or sentence in a criminal prosecution is neither a bar to a subsequent civil proceeding found on the same facts, nor is it proof of anything in such civil proceeding, except the mere fact of rendition. So, where the same acts or transactions constitute a crime and also give a right of action for damages or for a penalty, the acquittal of defendant when tried for the criminal offense is no bar to the prosecution of the civil action against him, nor is it evidence of his innocence in such action ____\nAccord Commonwealth v. Funk, 323 Pa. 390, 400, 186 A. 65, 69 (1936) (administrative revocation of driver\u2019s license following acquittal on drunken driving charge). \u201cThe reason for this rule is that the administrative action is civil, not criminal, in nature ... designed only for the protection of the public interest through exercise of the police power ....\u201d V.J.R. Bar Corp., 480 Pa. at 326, 390 A.2d at 165.\nSince the actual disposition of the criminal charges against Swaydis did not control whether Swaydis could be held accountable for his conduct in a court martial proceeding, the Governor was not deprived of a material fact to be considered in deciding whether to approve such a proceeding when the Commissioner failed to provide notice that the criminal charges had been dismissed. The memorandum from the Commissioner to the Governor, describing specific acts of misconduct of which Swaydis could be accused in a court martial proceeding, enumerated specific Pennsylvania State Field Regulations alleged to have been violated by Swaydis. Violations of those regulations supplied the basis for a court martial proceeding to be convened. The fact that criminal charges arising from the same misconduct had been dismissed would not, to any extent, preclude a court martial board from determining that violations of those regulations had occurred. Thus, we believe Commonwealth Court erred in holding that the court martial proceeding was rendered void by the Commissioner\u2019s not having informed the Governor as to the district magistrate\u2019s disposition of criminal charges. Dismissal of the criminal charges was, in short, not dispositive of the question of whether Swaydis should be held accountable for the acts of misconduct described in the Commissioner\u2019s memorandum to the Governor.\nOrder reversed.\nZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion in which LARSEN, J., joins.\n.
