{"id": "1275680", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nEberle applied for Workmen\u2019s Compensation, averring that he \u201cwas leaving the premises of his employer at about 5:85 p.m. on June 17, 1952\u201d and \u201cslipped on a banana peel\u201d and fractured his pelvis. He subsequently died, as did his widow, and the present claim is being made by his son and heir for Workmen\u2019s Compensation for the period from the date of his injury, namely, June 17, 1952, until his death on September 12, 1955.\nThe pertinent facts are briefly as follows:\nEberle, a man then seventy years of age, was employed by Union Dental Instrument Manufacturing Company as a bench hand. The Dental Company was one of a, number of tenants in a building at 32nd and Arch Streets, Philadelphia. Claimant\u2019s place of employment was on the third floor of the building. On the day of the accident he had completed his day\u2019s work, left the third floor, walked down to the street, walked out of the building through an exit door on the 32nd Street side of the building and walked south on the public sidewalk on 32nd Street to go to his home. Eberle slipped and fell on a driveway which crossed the public sidewalk and led to a loading door of the building which was used by the Union Dental Company. The \u201cdriveway\u201d in question is a brick paved section of the public sidewalk on the west side of 32nd Street. The loading door abutting this portion of the sidewalk was marked with a sign: \u201cUnion Dental Company Dasher Manufacturing Company Shipping and Deceiving.\u201d\nThe lease by the owners of the building to Union Dental Company provides: \u201cAll covenants and agreements herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, it is understood and agreed that an area approximately twelve feet by thirty feet in the rear portion of the demised premises at the loading door is reserved by lessor for use as a common shipping area for the occupants of other portions of the building of which the demised premises is a part. Lessee agrees that lessor may at any time during the term of this lease or any renewal thereof, erect an enclosure or partition to divide said shipping area from the first floor of the said south building. . . .\u201d\nNotwithstanding this lease, it was conceded that ever since 1949 Union Dental Company has had the exclusive use of the loading platform for access to the area on the first floor which it occupied under its lease.\nThis case is governed by Article III, Sec. 301 of the Act of June 2, 1915, as amended: \u201c. . . The term \u2018injury by an accident in the course of his employment\u2019, . . . shall include all other injuries sustained While the employe is actually engaged in the furtherance of the business or affairs of the employer, whether upon the employer\u2019s premises or elsewhere, and shall include all injuries caused by the condition of the premises or by the operation of the employer\u2019s business or affairs thereon, sustained by the employe, who, though not so engaged, is injured upon the premises occupied by or under the control of the employer, or upon which the employer\u2019s business or affairs are being carried on, the employe\u2019s presence thereon being required by the nature of his employment.\u201d\nThere is no contention in this case that the injury was caused by an accident in the course of his employment or that Eberle was engaged in furthering his employer\u2019s business at the time of the accident ; on the contrary, he had finished his work and was. headed home.\nThe Referee and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board and the Court of Common Pleas found for the plaintiff; The Superior Court in Eberle v. Union Dental Company, 182 Pa. Superior Ct. 519, 128 A. 2d 136, reversed. Judge Hiet found as a matter of law that claimant\u2019s injury occurred on the premises of defendant and in a very able opinion said (page 522-523) :\n\u201cThe difficulty confronting claimant in this appeal however is that his presence on the driveway was not \u2018required by the nature of his employment\u2019. Claimant\u2019s use of the stairway in the building in going to his place of work and in leaving the building at the end of the day were required by his assignment to a bench on the third floor for the performance of his duties. . . . when claimant stepped to the cement sidewalk at the foot of the stairs, as he left the building, his employment for the day terminated. On reaching the sidewalk claimant turned south to his right, but not because of anything further required of him \u2018by the nature of his employment\u2019. He headed south \u2018to get the el\u2019. When he stepped on to the brick driveway the reciprocal obligations of claimant and the employer, each to the other, had been satisfied for the day. When injured, claimant was no more than a member of the public using the sidewalk as a pedestrian \u2014 the purpose for which this part of the street had been dedicated for public use. He might have turned to his left on leaving the building instead of to his right. His employer was not interested in the route selected by him over public streets or sidewalks on his way home after his work for the day was fully ended; there was nothing in the nature of his employment which required him to walk upon the driveway.\u201d\nClaimant\u2019s injury did not occur from an accident in the course of his employment, and it is equally obvious that he was not actually engaged in the furtherance of the business or affairs of the employer. .We need not decide whether claimant was injured upon the premises which were under the control of the employer and other co-tenants (cf. Bruder v. Philadelphia, 302 Pa. 378, 153 A. 725) or upon which the employer\u2019s business was being carried on, because we are convinced that the claimant has not brought himself within the additional requirement and condition precedent of this statute, namely, that his presence on this driveway was required by the nature of his employment. As the Court said in Lints v. Delaware Ribbon Manufacturers, 173 Pa. Superior Ct. 540, 544, 98 A. 2d 643:\n\u201cIt is well established that in the absence of special circumstances an accidental injury in going to work or returning is not compensable.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nP. L. 736, as amended by Act of June 21, 1939, P. L. 520, 77 P.S. See. 411."}
