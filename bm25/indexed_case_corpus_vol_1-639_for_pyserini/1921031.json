{"id": "1921031", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nOrder affirmed by an equally divided Court.\nOpinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen\nin Support oe Affirmance :\nCommonwealth v. Baker, 429 Pa. 209, 239 A. 2d 201 (1968), and Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S. Ct. 1396, 18 L. ed. 2d 493 (1967), are not authority for the position taken by Justice O\u2019Brien. In both of these cases the issue came before the court upon direct appeal. Since the instant appeal relates to a post-conviction hearing, it is my opinion that we are not bound by the determination in Baker and Anders.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell and Mr. Justice Jones join in this opinion."}
