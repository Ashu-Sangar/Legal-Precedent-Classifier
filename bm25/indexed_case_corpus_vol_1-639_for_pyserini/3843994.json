{"id": "3843994", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nIn September, 1998, Lower Merion School District awarded a contract to appellee, Worth & Company, Inc., to perform construction work. Appellee subcontracted sprinkler work to First Choice Fire Protection, Inc. The Department of Labor and Industry subsequently investigated allegations that First Choice failed to pay certain workers on the project the prevailing minimum wage, as required by the Prevailing Wage Act. In a letter dated September 7, 1999, the Department requested appellee withhold $41,324.46 in contract payments to First Choice pending its investigation. The letter, borrowing language from \u00a7 10(a) of the Act, further stated \u201cbecause [the withholding request was] directed toward a subcontractor, nothing in [the] request shall be deemed to impair the right of the prime contractor to receive final payment due to the failure of any of the subcontractors to comply with the provisions in the Act.\u201d Department Letter, 9/7/99, Trial Exhibit 1.\nOn September 14, 1999, the School District informed appellee it would not approve its application for payment until the Department resolved First Choice\u2019s underpayment of workers. Two days later, the Department wrote a letter to the School District reiterating its position that First Choice\u2019s failure to comply with the Act\u2019s provisions would not impair appellee\u2019s right to receive final payment, again referring to \u00a7 10(a). Notwithstanding the September 16 letter, in June, 2000, the School District paid appellee $67,824.43, but withheld $32,890.28, representing appellee\u2019s contract retainage on the project.\nIn December, 2000, appellee sent a letter to the Department, again objecting to the School District withholding money owed under the contract. In response, the School District informed the Department it intended to continue withholding the money until the Department substantiated appellee\u2019s legal right to disbursement. In an attempt to resolve the conflict, the Department informed the School District and appellee it had reached a proposed settlement with First Choice, whereby First Choice agreed it underpaid employees by $25,797.19. The Department also informed the School District the Act limits any School District withholding to the amount owed to First Choice under the contract. Accordingly, the School District requested from appellee the amount owed to First Choice on the subcontract. Appellee complied by providing an itemization showing a negative balance due to First Choice.\nOn January 31, 2001, the School District informed the Department that as First Choice was not entitled to any further payment, it agreed it was no longer necessary to withhold funds. However, on February 6, 2001, the Department responded appellee could not claim it owed First Choice a negative balance based on replacement costs and other business expenses; since, without those costs, appellee owed First Choice $206,562.50 on the contract, the School District remained required to withhold the $32,890.28. See Department Letter, 2/6/01, Trial Exhibit 17.\nAppellee filed a grievance with the Prevailing Wage Appeal Board, but the Board deadlocked 2-2 and therefore affirmed the Department\u2019s position as stated in its September 7, 1999 letter, that the School District was required to withhold the funds.\nAppellee appealed. The Commonwealth Court, en banc, reversed the Board. The court agreed that the Department erred in authorizing the School District to withhold payment, when appellee owed no further payment to First Choice. Worth & Co., Inc. v. Dept. of Labor & Industry, 857 A.2d 727, 731-32 (Pa.Cmwlth.2004). The court emphasized \u00a7 10(a)\u2019s plain language, which states \u201cnothing herein shall impair the right of a contractor to receive final payment because of the failure of any subcontractor to comply with provisions of this act.\u201d Id., at 730 n. 7 (quoting 43 P.S. \u00a7 165-10(a)). The court explained \u00a7 10(b), which the Department relied on, only comes into play when a workman files a protest and objects to the payment of a contractor, which the record does not show to have been the case here. Id., at 731. Moreover, the court noted \u00a7 10(b) would only permit the School District to withhold money appellee owed to First Choice. As appellee owed no money to First Choice, the Commonwealth Court concluded \u00a7 10(b) was irrelevant to the dispute and under \u00a7 10(a)\u2019s plain language, the Department erred in directing the School District to withhold payment from appellee.\nJudge Smith-Ribner dissented, opining the majority erred in failing to defer to the Department\u2019s regulations, which authorize the withholding of payment under the circumstances here and which, she believed, \u201care consistent with the Act and fall squarely within [the Department\u2019s] statutory authority.\u201d Worth, at 734 (Smith-Ribner, J., dissenting). In Judge Smith-Ribner\u2019s view, these regulations were consistent with \u201cthe overriding purpose of the Act ... to protect workers employed on public projects by ensuring that they receive at least the prevailing minimum wage,\u201d and thus, she opined the Department\u2019s regulations represented an \u201centirely permissible exercise of its administrative rulemaking power\u201d to which the majority should have deferred. Id.\nJudge Pellegrini also filed a dissent, which Judge Simpson joined. Like Judge Smith-Ribner, Judge Pellegrini opined the Act \u201cdoes not intend that the prime contractor on a public work project receive final payment that includes wages that should have been paid to the subcontractor\u2019s employees.\u201d Worth, at 735 (Pellegrini, J., dissenting). Judge Pellegrini pointed out \u00a7\u00a7 10(a) and (b) aside, \u00a7 11(f) gives the Commonwealth its own right to seek payment of wages. Judge Pellegrini stated \u00a7 10(a) must be interpreted as providing \u201cthe failure of the subcontractor to provide such a statement means that the general contractor receives final payment for the work, less any funds retained for work performed by one of its subcontractors.\u201d Id., at 736. He noted, however, it was not clear whether appellee actually owed First Choice any more money for the work it had performed under the contract, and it was only these amounts that could properly be withheld. Judge Pellegrini believed the court should have remanded the case for a determination of whether \u201cany of the amounts withheld by the School District are for work performed by First Choice, for which it was not paid before it defaulted on the project....\u201d Id., at 737.\nWe granted allowance of appeal to determine whether the Act limits the Department\u2019s ability to withhold payment to the primary contractor of the wages of employees who are working for subcontractors on public works projects. Since the interpretation of a statute is a question of law, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. In re Milton Hershey School, 590 Pa. 35, 911 A.2d 1258, 1261 (2006).\nThe Department argues the Commonwealth Court incorrectly held \u00a7 10(a) preempts \u00a7 10(b) and its regulations, asserting both sections should be read together to assure all public project workmen receive the prevailing wage. The Department also alleges the Commonwealth Court incorrectly held the Act\u2019s regulations do not permit subcontractor withholding, improperly restricting the Department\u2019s administrative rulemaking power. Finally, the Department argues the court\u2019s opinion leaves no reasonable or expeditious equivalent remedies as the Act\u2019s withholding provisions and regulations.\nAppellee counters the Act\u2019s plain and unambiguous language makes it clear a prime contractor is not liable for the subcontractor\u2019s debts. Additionally, appellee asserts the School District\u2019s withholding was not the only remedy for the Department because it could have pursued payment for the workers through First Choice\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.\n\u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). \u201cWords and phrases shall be construed according to the rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.... \u201d Id., \u00a7 1903(a). \u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d Id., \u00a7 1921(a). \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, they are presumed to be the best indication of legislative intent.\u201d Chanceford Aviation Properties, L.L.P. v. Chanceford Twp. Board of Supervisors, 592 Pa. 100, 923 A.2d 1099, 1104 (2007) (quoting Hannaberry HVAC v. Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeals Board (Snyder Jr.), 575 Pa.66, 834 A.2d 524, 531 (2003)) (internal citation omitted).\nHere, the Act\u2019s language, while typically prolix, is nevertheless free from ambiguity. Section 10(a) specifies \u201cnothing herein shall impair the right of a contractor to receive final payment because of the failure of any subcontractor to comply with provisions of this act.\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 165-10(a). The Department itself acknowledged \u00a7 10(a) in the September 7, 1999 letter to appellee. The letter requested a withholding against First Choice due to violations of the Act, but indicated that as the request was directed toward a subcontractor, the Act provided the prime contractor\u2019s right to payment should not be impaired. See Department Letter, 9/7/99, Trial Exhibit 1.\nLater in the proceedings, the Department changed its position, seeking to withhold payments to appellee based on \u00a7 10(b). However, the Commonwealth Court found \u00a7 10(b) only applies when a workman liles a protest, objecting to payments made to a prime contractor. Worth, at 731 (citing 43 P.S. \u00a7 165 \u2014 10(b)). We agree. Section 10(b) specifically states a workman must file a written protest to a payment, and the payment complained of must be an amount due to the workman for work performed. See 43 P.S. \u00a7 165-10(b) (emphasis added). Here, the joint stipulation of facts, drafted February 5, 2002, noted appellee provided the School District with an itemization indicating a negative balance due to First Choice. See Joint Stipulation of Facts, 2/5/02, Trial Item No. 6, # 23. As appellee owed no balance to First Choice, there was no amount in controversy which the underpaid workers could have protested.\nThe Department asserts the Commonwealth Court dismissed .the Act\u2019s regulations, 34 Pa.Code \u00a7\u00a7 9.104(b) and 9.110(b), which authorize withholding. The court did not dismiss the regulations, but rather noted these regulations do not mention a contractor\u2019s right to final payment on a public works project, and certainly, the Department may not circumvent statutory protection afforded appellee under \u00a7 10(a). See Worth, at 731-32 n. 9. Despite the Department\u2019s reference to these regulations, it is axiomatic that a statute is the law and is preemptive of applicable agency regulations. See Snizaski v. WCAB (Rox Coal Co.), 586 Pa.146, 891 A.2d 1267, 1281 (2006).\nThe Department asserts the Commonwealth Court majority reached a result which left unpaid workers with no recourse. As the Commonwealth Court correctly noted, the Act provides a remedy when the prevailing wage is not paid. Sections 11(e) and (f) provide the Secretary of Labor and Industry may request the Attorney General to recover applicable penalties for the Commonwealth, and persons or firms who intentionally failed to pay the prevailing wages shall be liable to the Commonwealth for liquidated damages in the amount of wages due to workmen under a contract. See 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 165-ll(e), (f).\nAdditionally, the Bankruptcy Code offers an exception to the automatic stay once bankruptcy proceedings are initiated. Section 362(b)(4) provides a lift of the automatic stay \u201cof the commencement or continuation of an action or proceeding by a governmental unit ... to enforce such governmental unit\u2019s ... police and regulatory power....\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(b)(4). The Commonwealth Court cited In re Ngan Gung Restaurant, Inc., 183 B.R. 689 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1995), which held governmental units seeking to enforce labor laws are excepted from the automatic bankruptcy stay, and such exception applies to actions for employee restitution. Ngan Gung noted matters dealing with issues of public safety are excepted from the stay. Id., at 691 (citing Word v. Commerce Oil Co. (In re Commerce Oil Co.), 847 F.2d 291, 295 (6th Cir.1988)). The court found litigation by government units seeking to enjoin, assess penalties for improper labor law practices, or cause employers to make restitution have all been excepted from the automatic stay under \u00a7 362(b)(4). Id., at 691-92 (collecting cases). Because the Bankruptcy Code provides an exception to the automatic stay for enforcement of state and federal labor laws, the underpaid workmen here were not without remedy. Had the Secretary of Labor and Industry requested the Attorney General to recover applicable penalties pursuant to 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 165-ll(e) and (1), it could have resulted in a judgment for the workers, allowing an exception to the automatic stay provision in First Choice\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.\nIn addition to remedies through the Bankruptcy Code and \u00a7\u00a7 11(e) and (f) of the Act, underpaid workmen are also granted a remedy by \u00a7 13 of the Act, which states \u201c[a]ny workmen paid less than the rates specified in the contract shall have a right of action for the difference between the wage so paid and the wages stipulated in the contract....\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 165-13.\nBased on the parties\u2019 stipulation of facts, the record shows appellee does not owe First Choice any funds. Appellee was the contractor on a public works project, not an indemnitor or guarantor of First Choice\u2019s acts by statute or otherwise. Because the language of \u00a7 10(a) is clear and preemptive of other sections and regulations, we cannot disregard it. Appellee is entitled to final payment on its public works contract with the School District.\nOrder affirmed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nFormer Justice NEWMAN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CAPPY, Justice SAYLOR and BAER and Justice BALDWIN join the opinion.\nJustice CASTILLE files a dissenting opinion.\n. Act of August 15, 1961, P.L. 987, as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 165 \u2014 1\u2014165\u2014 17.\n. $41,324.46 was a preliminary estimate of First Choice\u2019s underpayment. Eventually, the Department and First Choice entered a joint stipulation indicating the underpayment of the workers was $25,797.19. See Joint Stipulation of Facts, 2/5/02, Trial Item No. 6, # 37. The Department concluded First Choice failed to pay appropriate wages to 11 workers.\n. Section 10(a) of the Act provides:\nBefore final payment is made by, or on behalf of any public body of any sum or sums due on public work, it shall be the duty of the treasurer of the public body or other officer or person charged with the custody and disbursement of the funds of the public body to require the contractor and subcontractor to file statements, in writing, in form satisfactory to the secretary, certifying to the amounts then due and owing from such contractor and subcontractor, filing such statements to any and all workmen for wages due on account of public work, setting forth therein the names of the persons whose wages are unpaid and the amount due to each respectively, which statement so to be filed shall be verified by the oath of the contractor and subcontractor, as the case may be, that he has read such statement subscribed by him, knows the contents thereof and that the same is true of his own knowledge: Provided, nevertheless, That nothing herein shall impair the right of a contractor to receive final payment because of the failure of any subcontractor to comply with provisions of this act.\n43 P.S. \u00a7 165-10(a) (emphasis added).\n. A contract \"retainage\" is a percentage withheld until the construction has been satisfactorily completed and all mechanic\u2019s liens are released or have expired. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1317 (7th ed. 1999).\n. Appellee's contract with First Choice was for $323,000, but First Choice defaulted. Appellee paid First Choice $116,437.50 for the work actually completed. First Choice filed for bankruptcy, and appellee paid another subcontractor $194,000 to complete the work. After purchasing materials, providing labor, and paying legal costs resulting from the default, appellee sustained a net loss of $3,505.15 on the contract with First Choice.\n. Section 10(b) of the Act provides:\nIn case any workman shall have filed a protest, in writing, within three months from the date of the occurrence of the incident complained of, with the secretary, objecting to the payment to any contractor to the extent of the amount or amounts due or to become due to the said workman for wages for labors performed on public works, thereupon, the secretary shall direct the fiscal or financial officer of the public body, or other person charged with the custody and disbursements of the funds of the public body, to deduct from the whole amount of any payment on account thereof the sum or sums admitted by any contractor in such statement or statements so filed, to be due and owing by him on account of wages earned on such public work before making payment of the amount certified for payment and may withhold the amount so deducted for the benefit of the workmen whose wages are unpaid, as shown by the verified statements filed by any contractor, and may pay directly to any workmen the amount shown to be due to him for such wages....\n43 P.S. \u00a7 165-10(b) (footnote omitted).\n. The Commonwealth Court also criticized the Department's reliance on its own regulations to support its position, noting \"Lt]he Department may not circumvent the statutory protection afforded to Worth by Section 10(a) of the Act.\u201d Id., at 731- 32 n. 9.\n. Section 11(1) of the Act provides:\nWhenever it shall be determined by the secretary, after notice and hearing as required by this section, that any person or firm has failed to pay the prevailing wages and that such failure was intentional, such persons or firm shall be liable to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for liquidated damages, in addition to damages for any other breach of the contract in the amount of the underpayment of wages due any workman engaged in the performance of such contract.\n43 P.S. \u00a7 11(f).\n. The fiscal officer of the public body, the treasurer or other officer of the public body, charged with the custody and disbursement of the funds of the public body, shall ascertain that the wage rates ... are maintained, otherwise it is his duty to uphold final payment and to inform the Secretary of the failure by the contractor or a subcontractor to comply with the act.\n34 Pa.Code \u00a7 9.104(b).\n. It is the duty of the treasurer or other officer charged with the custody and disbursement of public funds to withhold the amount of wages unpaid or not paid ... for the benefit of the workman whose wages have not been paid by the contractor and he may pay directly to a workman the amount shown to be due him.\n34 Pa.Code \u00a7 9.110(b)."}
