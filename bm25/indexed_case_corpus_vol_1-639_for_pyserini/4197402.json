{"id": "4197402", "contents": "PER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 18th day of November, 2009, the order of the Commonwealth Court of November 24, 2008, in the above matter, is AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART. Specifically, the order of the Commonwealth Court is AFFIRMED to the extent that it dismisses with prejudice all relief requested by Appellant, James Welch, that deviates from the relief specifically provided for by 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5726(a), which vests jurisdiction in the Commonwealth Court. However, contrary to the conclusion of the Commonwealth Court, it appearing that Appellant has specifically alleged violations of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5703 and 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5741, and, absent full and sufficient legal analysis of these and related provisions by the Commonwealth Court establishing otherwise, it appearing that Appellant has alleged sufficient facts that may meet the criteria for establishing violations of these sections, the Commonwealth Court incorrectly concluded that it is clear and free from all doubt that Appellant has failed to plead a viable cause of action pursuant to 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5726. Accordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court is REVERSED IN PART, and this matter is REMANDED to the Commonwealth Court for further proceedings on Appellant\u2019s 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5726 claim. In those further proceedings, Appellant\u2019s allegations may be tested, pursuant to any well-pled motion, by appropriate legal analysis of the applicable sections of the Wiretapping and Electronic Surveillance Control Act, taking into consideration, among other things, the provisions of 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5703 and 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5741 and the legislative definitions set forth at 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5702, and any factual record established before the Commonwealth Court.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a Concurring and Dissenting Statement, in which Justice EAKIN joins.\nJustice TODD dissents, and would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court."}
