{"id": "810281", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThe appellant filed her petition in the court below, praying that the boundaries of the borough of Wilkinsburg may be so modified as to exclude her land therefrom. She alleges that it is farm land. The act of April 1,1863, P. L. 200, \u00a7 1, provides that \u201c whenever an application has been or shall hereafter be made, by the freeholders of any town or village in the commonwealth, for an act of incorporation into a borough, and the boundaries fixed by the petitioners shall embrace lands exclusively used for the purposes of farming, and not properly belonging to the town or village, the courts of Quarter Sessions of the county where such application is made shall have power, at the request of the party aggrieved, to change and modify such boundaries so as to exclude therefrom the land used for farming purposes.\u201d We think this act contemplates an application to the court at the time the charter is before it for approval. In this case the borough had been incorporated prior to the filing of appellant\u2019s petition, and its limits had been fixed by the decree of the court. In such case, we think the remedy is under the act of April 1, 1834, P. L. 163, the third section of which provides, inter alia, that \u201cthe same proceedings shall be had, on an application to change the limits of any borough incorporated under this act, and the courts aforesaid shall have full power to decree such alteration as may be needful.\u201d The \u201csame proceedings,\u201d referred to, consist of an application \u201c signed by a majority of the freeholders residing within the limits of the same; \u201d that is to say, within the borough. The court cannot change the boundaries of a borough upon the application of a single freeholder. An examination of the plan appended to the petitioner\u2019s paper-book shows that a considerable portion, at least, of her land lies within what may be fairly called the natural boundaries of the borough, while her petition alleges that she has three houses upon it. But, whatever may be the merits of her case, we cannot help her in this proceeding. - - \u25a0\nThe order of the Quarter Sessions is affirmed."}
