{"id": "483643", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nIn this appeal, appellants, as representatives of all those similarly situated, challenge the use of \u201cplacement agreements\u201d by the Child Care Service of the Delaware County Institution District. Under these agreements parents consent to the transfer of the custody of their children to the Service. Appellants contend that these agreements are without statutory authorization and that their use violates the due process clause of the federal constitution.\nThe action from which this appeal arises was filed in equity. The chancellor, concluding that appellants had failed to state a cause of action upon which relief could be granted, sustained appellees\u2019 preliminary objections and dismissed the class aspects of the action. We affirm.\nAccording to their complaint, on August 28, 1972, appellants, Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Lee, entered into a \u201cplacement agreement\u201d transferring custody of their son to the Child Care Service. About eight months later, the Lees wrote the Service requesting that their child be returned to their custody. When the Service refused to return the child, the Lees brought this action both as individuals and as class representatives.\nAs individuals, appellants claim that they were fraudulently induced to sign the agreement transferring custody. On this theory they seek to recover $10,000 compensatory and $20,000 punitive damages against the appellees: the Service, the caseworker who it is asserted induced them to sign the agreement, the director of the Service, the administrative assistant of the Service and two unknown, unnamed agents of the Service. They also seek to recover from appellees $2,500 compensatory and $5,000 punitive damages for the intentional infliction of mental distress and loss of consortium.\nThe Lees also assert that they are representatives of a class composed of all residents of Delaware County the custody of whose children has been or may in the future be transferred by parents to the Service pursuant to \u201cplacement agreements.\u201d On behalf of this class, the Lees request the rescission of the agreements transferring custody from the members of the class to the Service, $10,000 compensatory and $20,000 punitive damages, and preliminary and permanent injunctions ordering the Service to cease entering into \u201cplacement agreements\u201d without court approval.\nAppellees filed preliminary objections. After a hearing on appellants\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction, the chancellor sustained appellees\u2019 preliminary objections with leave to amend as to the individual claims. These individual claims are apparently still pending below and are not the subject of this appeal. As already noted the chancellor also sustained preliminary objections to the class claims and dismissed the class action. It is from that portion of the order that this appeal arises.\nThe Service utilizes \u201cplacement agreements\u201d pursuant to regulations of the Department of Public Welfare. Regulation 3220 C provides:\n\u201cChildren shall not be removed from their own homes without the written consent of the parents . unless the child has been committed to the agency by the court.\u201d\nRegulation 3231 D sets the requirements for such agreements :\n\u201cWhen a child is received for foster care at the request of the parents, or with their consent, the placement agreement . . . shall be in writing signed by the child\u2019s parents and a representative of the public child welfare agency. A petition to the Juvenile Court shall not be required for the placement of a child, except where a change of custody or guardianship is deemed advisable for [the child\u2019s] protection.\u201d\nAppellants assert that these regulations contravene the statutes governing administration of child care services and are therefore void. They contend that under Pennsylvania statutes custody of a child cannot, even with parental consent, be transferred to an agency without a court order.\nThe source of the Department of Public Welfare\u2019s authority to promulgate regulations is the Act of June 13, 1967, P.L. 31, No. 21, art. 7, \u00a7 703, 62 P.S. \u00a7 703 (1968).\n\u201cThe department shall make and enforce all rules and regulations necessary and appropriate to the proper accomplishment of the child welfare duties and functions vested by law in the county institution districts or their successors.\u201d\nThe duties and functions vested in the county institution districts are contained in the Act of June 24, 1937, P.L. 2017, art. IV, \u00a7 405, as amended, 62 P.S. \u00a7 2305 (1968):\n\u201cThe local authorities of any institution district shall have the power, and for the purpose of protecting and promoting the welfare of children and youth, it shall be their duty to provide those child welfare services designed to keep children in their own home, prevent neglect, abuse and exploitation, help overcome problems that result in dependency, neglect or delinquency, to provide in foster family homes or child caring institutions adequate substitute care for any child in need of such care and, upon the request of the court, to provide such service and care for children and youth who have been adjudicated dependent, neglected or delinquent.\u201d\nThe chancellor, after reviewing the statutes, concluded that \u201c[the Service] not only [may] accept children for placement, it is its duty to provide such a service for children needing substitute care. . . . The law clearly intends [the Service] to provide services either on a voluntary basis (parental consent, or by Juvenile Court referral.\u201d\nWe agree that the Department of Public Welfare in adopting regulations 3220 C and 3231 D was acting well within its statutory power to make rules necessary and appropriate to the accomplishment of the county institution districts\u2019 duty \u201cto provide in foster family homes or child caring institutions adequate substitute care for any child in need of such care.\u201d 62 P.S. \u00a7 2305 (1968). The Service in following these regulations was also acting within its proper authority.\nAppellants claim that the existence of statutes requiring judicial action in other instances of alterations of parental rights suggests a legislative policy of requiring a judicial hearing prior to the transfer of custody with parental consent. We find this argument unconvincing. The provisions cited by appellants are designed for purposes clearly distinguishable from the non-final, consensual transfer of custody achieved by the execution of a \u201cplacement agreement.\u201d The existence of these statutes for vastly different objectives does not establish that the Service\u2019s procedure is inconsistent with legislative intent.\nNor can we agree with appellants\u2019 argument that Pennsylvania case law prohibits the transfer of custody by parental agreement. Pennsylvania precedents merely provide that contracts for custody of children will not foreclose a court from making a contrary disposition in the best interests of the child. This doctrine does not support appellants\u2019 claim that \u201cplacement agreements\u201d are void as against public policy. Commonwealth ex rel. Children\u2019s Aid Society v. Gard, 362 Pa. 85, 92, 66 A.2d 300, 304 (1949); Commonwealth ex rel. Bankert v. Children\u2019s Services, 224 Pa.Super. 556, 307 A.2d 411 (1973); Commonwealth ex rel. Bachman v. Bradley, 171 Pa.Super. 587, 91 A.2d 379 (1952); Commonwealth ex rel. Brincher v. Bair, 169 Pa.Super. 45, 82 A.2d 79 (1951); Commonwealth ex rel. Berg v. The Catholic Bureau, 167 Pa.Super. 514, 76 A.2d 427 (1950).\nAppellants argue that even if the use of \u201cplacement agreements\u201d is authorized by Pennsylvania law, such use nevertheless violates the due process clause of the federal constitution. Relying chiefly upon the decisions of the United States Supreme Court in Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972) and Armstrong v. Manzo, 380 U.S. 545, 85 S.Ct. 1187, 14 L.Ed.2d 62 (1965), they argue that parents have a constitutionally protected interest in their children which may not be suspended without due process of law. They further assert that because the execution of a \u201cplacement agreement\u201d transfers custody of the children to the service with parental consent without provision for a court hearing, the use of such agreements is constitutionally impermissable as a denial of due process of law.\nWhile it is certainly true that parents have a constitutionally protected interest in their children, see, e. g., Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 637, 95 S.Ct. 1225, 1226, 43 L.Ed.2d 514 (1975) (dictum); Stanley, supra; appellants have failed to establish that the use of these \u201cplacement agreements\u201d in any way deprives them of due process. This is not a case where parental rights are terminated without an opportunity for the parent to prove their suitability to retain custody of their children. Compare Stanley, supra, and Armstrong, supra. Instead, here the parents consent to the transfer of custody to the Service and on that basis the Service undertakes the care of their children. Parents are told in clear language that conditions for the return of their children are \u201csubject to the approval of [the Service].\u201d Moreover, it is apparent that they give up no right to a judicial determination of their rights to custody of their children. The agreement clearly provides that in the event of any disagreement on the conditions for return of the child, the dispute will be \u201creviewed\u201d by the Juvenile Court.\nWe simply cannot find in the consensual transfer of custody of children to the Service any-deprivation of parental rights without due process of law. Appellants having failed to plead a cause of action, the chancellor and the court en banc correctly sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the class action.\nDecree affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which MANDERINO, J., joined.\n. Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(4), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(4) (Supp.1974).\nAn order sustaining preliminary objections and dismissing the class aspects of action is a final order even though individual aspects of the action may survive the order. The order effectively puts out of court those members of the class not parties to the individual action. In DiAngeli v. Fitzgerald, 433 Pa. 529, 252 A.2d 706 (1969), we held that where the court sustains preliminary objections as to one plaintiff but overrules the objections as to the other, the order sustaining the objections is a final order as to the plaintiff whose action is dismissed. In the present action, we have essentially the same situation with the class as the \u201cparties\u201d who are put out of court. We conclude that the class, by its representatives, may appeal from the decree of the chancellor.\n. The following is the agreement actually used by the Service:\nCHILD CARE SERVICE, DELAWARE COUNTY INSTITUTION DISTRICT\nDelaware County, Pennsylvania\nIN Re: :\nCHILDREN :\nTHIS AGREEMENT, made _ day of_, 19\u2014 be-[parents, guardian, etc.] tween_of-and (CHILD OR CHILDREN) CHILD CARE SERVICE of the DELAWARE COUNTY INSTITUTION DISTRICT, Front and Orange Streets, Media, Pennsylvania. [parents] I, WE _request placement for\n(CHILD OR CHILDREN)\nbecause [reason, e. g., Mr. and Mrs. Lee wrote in this space \u201cI feel Phil needs extra help.\u201d]\nI, WE agree that said child/children may be removed from [our ' home] and hereby grant and give custody of said child/children to said Child Care Service.\nI, WE agree to work with Child Care Service until plans for said child/children are completed in order that the interests of said child/children shall be adequately protected. I\u201e WE further agree that conditions for the return of the child/children shall be subject to the approval of CHILD CARE SERVICE.\nChild Care Service agrees to provide placement, clothing, medical care and other requisites, and to arrange appropriate visiting provisions.\nIn case of disagreement between the parties involved and said Child Care Service, the Juvenile Court of Delaware County is available to review the matters in dispute and enter such order or orders as shall be necessary.\nCASEWORKER: _PARENTS-GUARDIAN\n_ _PARENTS-GUARDIAN\n. The provisions referred to by appellants are the Juvenile Act, Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1464, No. 333, \u00a7 1 et seq., 11 P.S. \u00a7 50-101 et seq. (Supp.1974), and the Adoption Act, Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, No. 208, art. Ill, \u00a7\u00a7 301-03, 311-13, 1 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 301-03, 311-13 (Supp.1974). The Juvenile Act provides hearings for children accused of committing a delinquent act as defined by the Act, or who are otherwise asserted to be in need of supervision due to the lack of adequate parental care or habitual and unjustified truancy from school.\nSections 301-03 of the Adoption Act provide procedures by which parents may \u201crelinquish forever all parental rights and duties with respect to their child.\u201d Id. \u00a7 301, 1 P.S. \u00a7 301 (Supp. 1974). Sections 311-13 of the Adoption Act provide for the permanent and involuntary termination of all parental rights.\n. Appellants assert in their supplemental brief that the class was deprived of its due-process rights by the Service\u2019s use of coercion in obtaining parental consent to the transfers of custody. We have reviewed the complaint and, although the complaint is not altogether clear, we conclude that this issue was not raised. This was also apparently the view of the chancellor. Our conclusion is fortified by appellants\u2019 assertion in their first brief that the \u201cform [of the agreements] and the lack of judicial scrutiny\u201d are the \u201ccore\u201d of appellants\u2019 challenge. Issues not presented below may not be raised upon appeal. In re Sanders Children, 454 Pa. 350, 353 n. 6, 312 A.2d 414 n. 6 (1973)."}
