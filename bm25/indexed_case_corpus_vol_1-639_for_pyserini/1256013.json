{"id": "1256013", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Chief Justice Horace Stern,\nThe only question in this case is whether a certain institution operated by the plaintiff is to be deemed a \u201cschool\u201d or a \u201csanitarium\u201d within the meaning of a zoning ordinance of the City of Philadelphia.\nPlaintiff, Mabelle S. Walker, is the purchaser, under an agreement of sale, of premises 6399 Drexel Road, Philadelphia. She filed an application with the Zoning Division of ..the Department of Licenses and Inspections for a permit to use those premises for a school for physically handicapped children. The Zoning Division denied her application and, on appeal, the Zoning, Board of Adjustment likewise refused her request. Thereupon the plaintiff took her case to the Court of Common Pleas No. 3 of the County of Philadelphia, which reversed the decision of the Zoning Board- on the ground that its action was arbitrary, capricious, -and without foundation in the evidence, and it remanded the record to the Board with direction to issue the permit for which application had been made. Overbrook Farms Club, which intervened in the proceedings, now .appeals from that order of the court. Since the Act of May 6, 1929, P.L. 1551, which deals with zoning ordinances of cities of the first class, does not provide for any appeal from the court below our review is merely as on certiorari and we examine the record only to see whether there is any evidence to sustain the. findings and whether the proceeding is free from a violation of positive law and any flagrant abuse of discretion.\nThe premises in question are situated in a district designated \u201cA\u201d Residential by the Philadelphia Zoning Ordinance of August 10, 1933, as amended. Subsections 5 and 7 of Section 7 of the Ordinance provide that the uses permitted in such a district shall be: \u201c (5) Schools, colleges, universities, convents and dormitories . . . (7) Hospitals, sanitaria, eleemosynary and public institutions (other than correctional), provided, any such use is not prejudicial to the public health or welfare.\u201d Subsection 21 provides: \u201cHospitals, sanitaria, eleemosynary and public institutions (other than correctional), shall be located at least seventy-five (75) feet from any adjoining lot or lots.\u201d\nIt is admitted that the building on the premises 6399 Drexel Road, which has heretofore been occupied as a residence, falls somewhat short of the 75' requirement. If, therefore, the property is to be regarded as a \u201csanitarium\u201d the application was properly denied, but if for a \u201cschool\u201d the application should have been granted since the ordinance does not provide for such a requirement in the case of schools.\nPlaintiff is a graduate clinical psychologist with 30 years\u2019 specialized experience in the education of physically handicapped children. She has long conducted an institution for the education of such children at a property on City Line Avenue, which premises, however, have been sold, so that she now wishes to remove to the Drexel Road property. The school is licensed by the Private Schools Division of the Department of Public Instruction of this Commonwealth as a \u201cprivate academic school or class in \u2018special education . . . physically handicapped children\u2019/\u2019 and she is duly certificated as a teacher by that Department. The school is under the supervision, not of the Department of Welfare, which has general supervision of sanitaria, but of the Department of Public Instruction. None of the children in attendance are \u201cmental eases\u201d but are merely handicapped physically, all except one being afflicted with cerebral palsy. There are 36 students, 20 of whom commute daily from home and the remaining 16 board at the school because they come from distant points. Following the ordinary school schedule, classes are from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays, and the curriculum covers the courses which are generally given from kindergarten through high school; some of the graduates matriculate in college. There is the usual summer vacation period although 3 of the students who come from faraway places remain during the summer months because the distances from their homes prevent travel back and forth. The staff consists of from 18 to 20 persons, 12 of whom are instructors, the rest consisting of household employes and assistants who give manual aid to the children. The principal difference between this school and the public schools is the high ratio of teachers to students, thus making possible a smaller size of the classes and enabling the students to obtain more individualized attention.\nA \u201csanitarium\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s International Dictionary as \u201cA health station or retreat; an institution for the recuperation and treatment of persons suffering from physical or mental disorders.\u201d Miss Walker\u2019s institution is not a sanitarium since it is not designed to give, nor does it give, treatment to its students for their physical disorders; it seeks to educate their minds, which are normal, not to cure their physical disabilities. It is a school the same as any other private school except that its students are physieally handicapped. The ordinance, in employing the term \u201cschools,\u201d makes no distinction between schools of different types.\nThe Zoning Division of the Department of Licenses and Inspections rejected Miss Walker\u2019s application on the ground that \u201cany building used for a school for handicapped children is required to be at least 75' from any lot or lots\u201d; this obviously was erroneous because there is no such requirement in the ordinance for a school whether for handicapped children or otherwise. The Zoning Board of Adjustment rejected the application for the same erroneous reason; moreover, it stated that the appeal to the Board was for a variance, which was likewise erroneous since the permit was not sought as a variance but demanded as a matter of right under the terms of the ordinance.\nThe appellant cites Jewish National Folk School\u2019s Case, 327 Pa. 578, 195 A. 9, which dealt with a situation where the record showed that the applicant desired to use the premises for purposes in addition to what were described as school purposes. In the present case there is nothing to indicate that the use of the premises is to be for any purpose in addition to, or other than, that of intellectual education. As far as the Devereux Foundation, Inc., Zoning Case, 351 Pa. 478, 41 A. 2d 744, also relied upon by appellant, is concerned, the application for a variance was there rejected because of an express provision in the zoning ordinance that, while a building might be used for an educational use, any \u201cstructure or other place for accommodating . . . persons mentally deficient, weak or abnormal\u201d was excluded, and it was therefore held that a dormitory which \u201caccommodated\u201d pupils who were \u201cmentally deficient\u201d and who constituted the student body of the institution, fell within the ban of the ordinance.\nThe order of the court below is affirmed.\nAnderle Appeal, 350 Pa. 589, 592, 39 A.2d 829, 830; Veltri, Zoning Case, 355 Pa. 135, 137, 49 A. 2d 369, 370; Berman v.
