{"id": "898032", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe court below was so clearly right in entering the judgment from which this appeal was taken that it is unnecessary to consume time in considering the questions intended to be raised by the specifications of error. There is nothing in either of them that requires discussion.\nIt is conceded in the first affidavit that the defendant, J. K. Harris, executed and delivered to the plaintiff the mortgage on which the scire facias was issued, but it is averred, by way of defense, that \u201che did not have title to more than one seventh of the land described in the mortgage.\u201d It cannot be doubted that whatever interest he had when the mortgage was executed \u2014whether it remained in him or passed to the terre-tenants by conveyance \u2014 the same is bound by the mortgage, and to that extent at least the title will pass to the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale: St. John\u2019s Church v. Steinmetz, 18 Pa. 273. If the terretenants acquired title from other and independent sources, it cannot be affected by such sale.\nJudgment affirmed."}
