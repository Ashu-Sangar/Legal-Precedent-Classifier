{"id": "270270", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice CAPPY.\nIn this appeal, we address the validity of a driver license suspension under the Driver\u2019s License Compact (\u201cCompact\u201d), 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1581, and the effect of the legislature\u2019s passage of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1586. For the reasons herein, we affirm.\nOn August 12, 1999, Appellant Matthew Wroblewski was convicted of the New York offense of driving while ability impaired (\u201cDWAI\u201d), N.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law \u00a7 1192G). As both New York and Pennsylvania are parties to the Compact, authorities in New York reported the conviction to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing (hereinafter \u201cAppellee\u201d or \u201cPenn-DOT\u201d). See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1581, Art. III. Pursuant to Article IV(a)(2), when a party state reports a conviction for \u201cdriving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor ... to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving a motor vehicle,\u201d PennDOT must give the same effect to the out-of-state conviction as it would if that conduct had occurred within Pennsylvania. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1581, Art. IV(a); Petrovick v. Com., Dept. of Transp., Bureau of Driver Lic., 559 Pa. 614, 741 A.2d 1264, 1266 (1999). Where the laws of a party state do not provide for offenses which are described in the words contained in Article IV(a)(2) (i.e., \u201cto a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving a motor vehicle\u201d), Article IV(c) authorizes the party state to construe the offense described in subsection (a)(2) as identifying offenses in the party state which are \u201cof a substantially similar nature\u201d to (a)(2). Id. PennDOT notified Appellant that it was treating his New York DWAI conviction as \u201cequivalent\u201d to a conviction of \u00a7 3731 of the Pennsylvania Vehicle Code, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731 (relating to driving undei* the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance), and was suspending his driving privilege for one year, pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(b) (requiring one-year suspension for convictions of \u00a7 3731(a), or substantially similar offenses reported under Article III). See Letter from Appellee dated October 8, 1999.\nAppellant appealed the suspension to the trial court, which sustained the appeal. The trial court relied on the analysis set forth in Petrovich, a case involving a license suspension for a conviction under the same New York statute at issue in the instant case. In Petrovich, this Court addressed the appropriate analysis for effectuating a reciprocal suspension under Article IV of the Compact. We explained that the Compact did not call for a direct comparison of a Pennsylvania statute to the out-of-state statute. 741 A.2d at 1266. Rather, we determined that the Compact requires a two-prong test: (1) an evaluation of whether there is a Pennsylvania offense which is \u201cof a substantially similar nature\u201d to the provisions of Article IV(a)(2) of the Compact, and then (2) an evaluation of whether there is a New York offense which is \u201cof a substantially similar nature\u201d to Article IV(a)(2). Id. at 1267. We concluded, in pertinent part, that the New York offense was not substantially similar to Article IV(a)(2) because the New York DWAI statute punished impairment \u201cto any extent\u201d, whereas Article IV(a)(2) required impairment to a degree which rendered the person incapable of safely driving. See id. at 1268-69.\nIn the instant case, the trial court rejected PennDOT\u2019s argument that Appellant\u2019s license should be suspended pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1586, a provision which was enacted prior to this court\u2019s decision in Petrovich, but which became effective after the convictions in Petrovich occurred. Section 1586, entitled \u201cDuties of department\u201d states:\nThe department shall, for purposes of imposing a suspension or revocation under Article IV of the compact, treat reports of convictions received from party states that relate to driving, operating or being in actual physical control of a vehicle while impaired by or under the influence of alcohol, intoxicating liquor, drugs, narcotics, controlled substances or other impairing or intoxicating substance as being substantially similar to section 3731 (relating to driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance). The fact that the offense reported to the department by a party state may require a different degree of impairment of a person\u2019s ability to operate, drive or control a vehicle than that required to support a conviction for a violation of section 3731 shall not be a basis for determining that the party state\u2019s offense is not substantially similar to section 3731 for purposes of Article IV of the compact.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1586. The trial court found this provision to be \u201cinconsistent with the Compact which sets forth an impairment standard to be followed.\u201d Trial Ct. Opin. at 5. Because \u00a7 1586 called for a comparison of the states\u2019 statutes to each other, instead of a comparison to the provisions of Article IV(a)(2) as mandated by Petrovich, the trial court determined that the analysis of \u00a7 1586 \u201cis of no consequence.\u201d Id. at 5-6. The court further reasoned that the Compact focused on the driver\u2019s conduct, rather than the name or elements of the particular offense. Id. at 6. Adopting \u00a7 1586\u2019s analysis would result in inequitable treatment among Pennsylvania drivers for the same conduct, a result which would be contrary to the Compact\u2019s goal of encouraging uniformity in response to drunk driving. Id.\nOn appeal, the Commonwealth Court reversed. The court acknowledged that Petrovich held that New York\u2019s DWAI statute was not substantially similar to Article IV(a)(2) due to the differing degree of impairment required by the New York statute. Slip Opin. at 5-6. Nonetheless, the Commonwealth Court reasoned that Petrovich was \u201ceffectively overruled\u201d by the enactment of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1586, which \u201cexpressly rejects such a distinction.\u201d Id. at 6.\nOur review in this matter, which involves pure questions of law, is plenary. Commonwealth of Penn., Dept. of Transp. v. McCafferty et al., 563 Pa. 146, 758 A.2d 1155, 1158 (2000).\nAppellant argues that the Commonwealth Court erred in relying on \u00a7 1586. He contends that \u00a7 1586 is irrelevant to an analysis under the Compact because it erroneously directs a comparison between the out-of-state offense and the Pennsylvania offense. Applying the proper analysis set forth in Petrovich, New York\u2019s DWAI offense is not substantially similar to Article IV(a)(2), and thus Appellant\u2019s license suspension must be reversed. Moreover, Appellant argues that the conduct of which he was convicted in New York would not result in any criminal or civil consequences in Pennsylvania. Alternatively, Appellant asserts that \u00a7 1586 is invalid because it purports to unilaterally modify the terms of the Compact, an interstate agreement.\nAppellee counters that \u00a7 1586 broadened the scope of offenses that Pennsylvania considers to be substantially similar to Article IV(a)(2) of the Compact and to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731(a), and New York\u2019s DWAI offense comes within the scope of those substantially similar offenses. Because \u00a7 1586 is remedial legislation designed to further a compelling state interest in highway safety, it should be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928. Moreover, the legislature furthered the Compact\u2019s underlying policy by requiring Pennsylvania-licensed drivers to adhere to the drinking and driving laws of other party states, even if those laws differ from those in Pennsylvania. See Article 1(b)(1). Appellee contends that \u00a7 1586 is permissible legislation which represents the legislature\u2019s exercise of power granted under Article IV(c) to define which out-of-state offenses Pennsylvania considers to be substantially similar to offenses delineated under Article IV(a). Finally, Appellee relies on Squire v. Com., Dept. of Transp., Bureau of Driver Lic., 769 A.2d 1224 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001) and Horvath v. Com., Dept. of Transp., Bureau of Driver Lic., 773 A.2d 199 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001), which determined that \u00a7 1586 could provide the basis for a reciprocal suspension for a violation of the New York statute.\nWe agree with Appellee\u2019s position. Article IV(c) of the Compact granted the legislature the ability to define which out-of-state offenses Pennsylvania considers to be substantially similar to offenses delineated under Article IV(a). Specifically, Article IY(c) states in pertinent part that \u201cthe laws of such party state shall contain such provisions as may be necessary to ensure that full force and effect is given to this article.\u201d\nThe General Assembly took advantage of this grant of authority by passing \u00a7 1586. This court has deemed \u00a7 1586 to be an \u201cinterpretive and administrative provision[ ] related to implementation of the Compact in Pennsylvania.\u201d Har rington v. Com. of Penn., Dep\u2019t of Transp., 563 Pa. 565, 763 A.2d 386, 389, n. 4 (2000). Section 1586 directs that for purposes of Article IV, PennDOT shall treat reports of convictions from other states as being substantially similar to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731, the statutory provision that contains Pennsylvania\u2019s provisions relative to impaired driving. Section 1586 also rejects any distinction between the levels of impairment between the out-of-state offense and Pennsylvania\u2019s \u00a7 3731.\nSection 1586 clearly broadens the scope of offenses that Pennsylvania would consider to be \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the offenses delineated in Article IV(a)(2). Under the terms of \u00a7 1586, an out-of-state conviction for any level of impaired driving is punishable in Pennsylvania. In contrast, the Compact, as interpreted by Petrovich, required a level of impairment to a degree which rendered the operator \u201cincapable of safely driving\u201d; impairment which did not reach this level was not punishable.\nAdditionally, Article 1(b)(1) states that the policy of each party state is to \u201c[p'Jromote compliance with the laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles by their operators in each of the juiisdictions where such operators drive motor vehicles.\u201d We think it evident that in enacting \u00a7 1586, the legislature sought to promote this policy by sanctioning those Pennsylvania-licensed drivers who violated the impairment laws of other party states, even if those other states\u2019 offenses had lower thresholds of impairment than 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731. Thus, the fact that the New York offense permits conviction of a lower level of impairment than 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731 does not preclude Appellant\u2019s reciprocal license suspension.\nAccordingly, we hold that prior to the effective date of \u00a7 1586, Petrovich set forth the relevant analysis under the Compact. Section 1586, which was enacted after the Compact, supplants the Petrovich analysis and applies to any convictions after the effective date of that provision.\nWe turn to whether the Commonwealth Court properly ordered the suspension of Appellant\u2019s license under \u00a7 1586. Given the broad scope of \u00a7 1586, we conclude that Appellant\u2019s New York conviction can provide the basis for a reciprocal suspension of his driving privileges in Pennsylvania. The New York offense provides: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle while the person\u2019s ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of alcohol.\u201d N.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law. \u00a7 1192(1). Regardless of the level of Appellant\u2019s impairment, PennDOT was justified in suspending Appellant\u2019s license as the New York offense is to be deemed \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the provisions of Article IV(a) and 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731.\nAppellant also argues that \u00a7 1586 impermissibly unilaterally modifies the Compact. Appellant recognizes that courts have acknowledged that unilateral amendments of compacts that have been ratified by Congress may violate Article I, section 10 of the United States Constitution. See U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 3; Henderson v. Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Comm\u2019n, 362 Pa. 475, 66 A.2d 843 (1949), cert. denied, 338 U.S. 850, 70 S.Ct. 94, 94 L.Ed. 520 (1949). Appellant believes, however, that the Driver\u2019s License Compact is not reviewable under the United States Constitution because it did not receive the consent of Congress. Appellant seems to be of the opinion that there is some extra-constitutional basis on which we could find that there was an impermissible unilateral amendment. He fails however to develop this claim in any meaningful way. Accordingly, this claim entitles Appellant to no relief. Contrary to Appellant\u2019s assertion, this court does not have the power to strike down legislation on a non-constitutional basis.,\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nFormer Chief Justice FLAHERTY did not participate in the decision of this matter.\nMr. Chief Justice ZAPPALA files a dissenting opinion.\nMr. Justice NIGRO tiles a dissenting opinion.\n. That statute provides in pertinent part as follows: \"No person shall operate a motor vehicle while the person\u2019s ability to operate such motor vehicle is impaired by the consumption of alcohol.\u201d N.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law. \u00a7 1192(1). The record does not reflect Appellant\u2019s conviction of this particular provision, but the litigants agree that this was the statute Appellant violated.\n. Article IV provides in relevant part:\n(a) The licensing authority in the home state, for the purposes of suspension, revocation or limitation of the license to operate a motor vehicle, shall give the same effect to the conduct reported, pursuant to Article III of this compact, as it would if such conduct had occurred in the home state in the case of convictions for:\n(2) driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or a narcotic drug or under the influence of any other drug to a degree which renders the driver incapable of safely driving a motor vehicle;\n(c) If the laws of a party state do not provide for offenses or violations denominated or described in precisely the words employed in subdivision (a) of this article, such party state shall construe the denominations and descriptions appearing in subdivision (a) of this article as being applicable to and identifying those offenses or violations of a substantially similar nature and the laws of such party state shall contain such provisions as may be necessary to ensure that full force and effect is given to this article.\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1581, Art. IV(a)(2), (c).\n. In Petrovich, PennDOT invited the court to rely on \u00a7 1586, which became effective subsequent to the appellees' conviction dates. We declined to do so, noting that the legislature cannot create retroactive authority by passing clarifying legislation; that the General Assembly did not provide for retroactive application of \u00a7 1586; and that \"retroactive application of this amendment likely would affect the substantive rights of Appellees.... \u201d Petrovich, 741 A.2d at 1269.\n. The trial court also found that the New York authorities failed to comply with the reporting requirements of the Compact, thereby precluding PennDOT from sufficiently evaluating Appellant\u2019s conduct. That issue is not before us in this appeal.\n. As Appellant has failed to develop this argument, this court in no way opines on whether the Driver\u2019s License Compact required the consent of Congress, and if so, whether \u00a7 1586 is a unilateral amendment that would be constitutionally impermissible. Parenthetically, we note that it is questionable whether Appellant would have standing to assert that claim. See Henderson, 66 A.2d at 849 (stating that plaintiffs lacked standing to object that New Jersey had not formally consented to a purported unilateral amendment by the Pennsylvania General Assembly to a New Jersey-Pennsylvania compact).\n. Mr. Chief Justice Zappala erroneously states that we have deemed this issue to be \u201cwaived\u201d. Dissenting Slip Opin. at 3. In fact, we have determined that the issue was not sufficiently developed to establish a non-conslitutional basis upon which to declare the legislature\u2019s amendment, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1586, null and void. Despite the effort expended in the dissenting opinion (an effort which exceeds that of the Appellant), respectfully, we cannot subscribe to Mr. Chief Justice Zappala's attempt to apply general contract principles to invalidate an act of the General Assembly."}
