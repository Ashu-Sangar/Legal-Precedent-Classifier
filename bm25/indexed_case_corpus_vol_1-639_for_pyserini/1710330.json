{"id": "1710330", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis direct appeal follows a jury trial in which appellant was found guilty of murder in the second degree. A sentence of 5 to 20 years was imposed. We affirm.\nDuring the late evening and early morning hours of July 3 and 4, 1971, decedent and his friend were in the area of 32nd and York Streets in Philadelphia. Decedent walked over to a man named Tinsley and placed his arm around, his neck and shoulders. Within a few moments, appellant approached and shot decedent. It is undisputed that appellant was the killer. He claims, however, that (1) the discharge of the gun was accidental, and (2) decedent was threatening Tinsley and that appellant came to Tinsley\u2019s defense.\nAt the opening of trial the defense moved for sequestration of the witnesses. The Commonwealth agreed, and all but one of the witnesses were ordered sequestered. The Commonwealth presented three eyewitnesses to the killing. On cross-examination, the third eyewitness, Jesse Scott, gave testimony which indicated that the prosecutor had violated the sequestration order by reviewing the testimony of the other two eyewitnesses with Scott. That violation is the basis of this appeal.\nThe violation of the sequestration order was elicited by defense counsel at the opening of his cross-examination. After discovering the violation, however, he dropped the subject and conducted a thorough cross-examination of the witness. At the end of this cross-examination the defense moved for a mistrial and, upon denial of that motion, moved to have Scott\u2019s testimony stricken. Both motions were denied.\nThe Commonwealth contends that the delay between discovery of the violation and defense motions based upon the violation waived any objection that the defense might have made. We do not agree.\nWhen the party offering a witness has violated a sequestration order and has already conducted direct examination before the jury, the opponent, under the waiver rule urged by the Commonwealth, would be faced with an impossible choice if the trial court refused to grant a mistrial. Once the violation of the order is brought out and a motion for a mistrial is denied, the opposing party-may either move to strike the testimony, and risk letting the untested direct examination lay in the juror\u2019s subconscious minds if the motion is granted, or he may continue his cross-examination, but, according to the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed rule, waive a motion to strike based on the violation. The effect of the Commonwealth\u2019s rule is to eliminate, so far as the particular witness is concerned, the benefits of the sequestration order or cross-examination, \u201cthe greatest engines that the skill of man has ever invented for the detection of liars in a court of justice.\u201d To accept the Commonwealth\u2019s contention would be to compound its violation of a sequestration order with the imposition of an unjustified waiver. This we refuse to do.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s proposed waiver rule is inappropriate for a second reason. The waiver doctrine was developed to compel trial counsel to present objections to the trial court. If presented early enough, the trial court is often able to correct a trial error and thus to avoid unnecessary appeals. Counsel may not sit idly by while what would have been correctible errors occur only to raise those errors on appeal as ground for reversal. Thus delay in presenting objections, which prevents the trial courts from correcting reversible error results in waiver of those objections. See Dilliplaine v. Lehigh Valley Trust Co., 457 Pa. 255, 322 A.2d 114 (1974).\nThe application of the waiver doctrine to this fact situation is clearly inappropriate. Defense counsel substantially completed his cross-examination before moving for a mistrial or to strike the witness\u2019 testimony. If the mistrial had been granted, the only loss would have been the time spent on cross-examination. This is hardly such a loss as would justify a waiver being imposed on a litigant. If, on the other hand, the motion for a mistrial had been denied, but the motion to strike had been granted, the effect of the delay would have been that the jury would be directed to forget both the direct and the cross-examination. Because a jury is not absolutely able, despite the most sincere efforts, to put relevant facts completely out of its mind, the testing of the direct examination by cross-examination is a sufficiently worthwhile benefit to offset the delay in presenting the motions. In neither event is the time spent on cross-examination sufficient to justify imposition of a waiver on the party offended by the violation of the sequestration order.\nWe therefore hold that where, as here, the violation of a sequestration order is revealed at the beginning of cross-examination, there is no waiver in counsel\u2019s making motions based on the violation at the end of his cross-examination of the witness.\nBecause there was no waiver, we must address the trial court\u2019s responses to counsel\u2019s objections. Defense counsel moved for a mistrial and moved to have Scott\u2019s testimony stricken from the record. Both motions were denied without comment. Defense counsel requested no cautionary instruction and none was given. To prevail on this appeal, appellant must demonstrate that it was error for the trial court not to grant relief on one of the two motions made.\nThe selection of a remedy for the violation of a sequestration order is within the sound discretion of the trial court. See Commonwealth v. Martin, 440 Pa. 150, 153, 269 A.2d 722, 723 (1970); Commonwealth v. Turner, 389 Pa. 239, 264, 133 A.2d 187, 199 (1957). In exercising its discretion, the trial court should consider the seriousness of the violation, its impact on the testimony of the witness, and its probable impact on the outcome of the trial. We will disturb the trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion only if there is no reasonable ground for the action taken.\nHere there is support for the trial court's refusal to grant the defense motions. The court had heard the examination of the witness and therefore knew that Scott was one of three eyewitnesses to the killing, and that his testimony was the most favorable to the appellant of the three. Furthermore, the court was aware from cross-examination that Scott\u2019s testimony did not conflict in any relevant part with a statement Scott had given the police at the time of the killing. The court therefore had reason to believe that Scott\u2019s testimony was not altered as a result of the violation of the sequestration order.\nMoreover, the fact of the violation was shown in cross-examination and the court referred to it in its summary of the evidence for the jury. Although no cautionary instruction was given at any time after the violation came to light, none was requested. The jury was thus aware of the violation and its possible impact on the witness\u2019 testimony. On this basis the trial court could conclude that the jury took the violation of the sequestration order into account when weighing Scott\u2019s testimony. In these circumstances we find that the trial court committed no error in refusing to declare a mistrial or in refusing to strike Scott\u2019s testimony.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a concurring opinion, in which NIX, J., joins.\n. See Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp.1975).\n. A detective who investigated the crime was permitted to remain in the courtroom in order to assist the district attorney prosecuting the caos. No objection concerning this exception to the sequestration order is raised.\n. Although the record concerning the violation of the sequestration order is not ample, we must accept the trial court\u2019s finding supported, as it is, by substantial evidence that a violation did, in fact, occur. \u201cThis Court does not sit as a trier of issues of fact, expecting to be persuaded that one or the other side is more credible. That is only a task for a trial court and we would never invade that area of the judicial process.\u201d Reed v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., 434 Pa. 212, 217, 253 A.2d 101, 104 (1969). Therefore we do not address whether there was a violation of the order. The trial court found a violation, and we accept that finding.\n. Obviously, upon learning of the violation of the sequestration order, counsel could move for a mistrial without encountering the risks described in the text. However, we impose no such requirement. A motion for a mistrial made at the close of cross-examination, under the facts as given here, is timely under Pa.R.Crim. P. 1118.\n. Commonwealth v. Turner, 389 Pa. 239, 264, 133 A.2d 187, 199 (1957), quoting VI Wigmore on Evidence \u00a7 1838, at 352 (3d ed. 1940).\n. We are strengthened in our conclusion by the ease with which counsel could avoid the Commonwealth\u2019s proposed waiver by simply waiting until the end of cross-examination to question a witness concerning violations of a sequestration order. Courts do not sit to impose empty formalities on unwary litigants."}
