An examination of the latter discloses nothing that would have warranted an affirmance of the above quoted request. To have affirmed it would have been manifest error. In any proper view of the evidence the case was clearly for the exclusive consideration of the jury; and it was fairly submitted to them with full and adequate instructions as to the law applicable to the facts which the evidence tended to prove.\nJudgment affirmed."}
