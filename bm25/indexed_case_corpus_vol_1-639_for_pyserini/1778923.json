{"id": "1778923", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nRobert Percell appeals from the order of the Superior Court, Special Transfer Docket, affirming his convictions, after a jury trial, of voluntary manslaughter and possession of an instrument of crime. The charges arose from the January 22, 1975 shooting death of Isaac Bordley. Appellant contends that prosecutorial misconduct in the form of repeated and continuous disregarding of the court\u2019s rulings denied him a fair trial. We agree and, thus, reverse and grant a new trial.\nI.\nThe assistant district attorney scorned the trial court\u2019s ruling of inadmissibility of prior criminal charges not resulting in conviction on cross examination of a key defense witness. Russell Kolins, a court-appointed investigator, testified that he was a licensed private detective and that, in order to obtain his license, he was subjected to an investigation by the district attorney\u2019s office as to his character, integrity and standing in the community. He was called by the defense to testify that, inter alia, one prosecution witness who was an off-duty policeman refused to sign a statement identifying appellant as the assailant, and that the district attorney\u2019s office pressured another witness to implicate appellant and this witness gave a false statement to the police and lied about his identity.\nPrior to this trial, Mr. Kolins had been charged with witness tampering in connection with another trial; this charge did not result in a conviction. Early in the trial, the court ruled evidence of this charge was inadmissible. Despite this ruling, the district attorney subsequently announced her intention to use evidence of this charge to impeach Kolins\u2019 credibility, whereupon the court correctly reiterated the inadmissibility of such evidence, Commonwealth v. Ross, 434 Pa. 167, 170, 252 A.2d 661, 662 (1969). Despite the court\u2019s ruling, the prosecutor asked five questions regarding this charge. Although repeated objections were sustained and limiting instructions given, the unavoidable effect of such conduct was to raise in the minds of the jurors the inference that the defense was harboring an unreliable witness \u2014 a witness who would suppress the truth and pervert the criminal justice system by tampering with witnesses. This Court has said, \u201cWhere counsel persists in intentionally seeking to inject incompetent evidence into the case such misconduct prevents a fair trial and warrants reversal.\u201d Commonwealth v. Ravenell, 448 Pa. 162, 171, 292 A.2d 365, 370 (1970). Sustaining defense objections and giving limiting instructions were inadequate measures to cure the resulting prejudice to appellant, and the lower court\u2019s refusal to grant a mistrial was error.\nII.\nAppellant took the stand and, in the course of identifying himself, testified to certain \u201chistorical\u201d facts regarding his residence in the neighborhood where the crime occurred, his family and his employment status. Arguing appellant had thus put his character in issue, the prosecutor announced her intention to impeach appellant\u2019s \u201creputation\u201d evidence by prior convictions. These crimes were not crimen falsi and, thus, could not be admissible to impeach appellant\u2019s credibility. See Commonwealth v. Roots, 482 Pa. 33, 393 A.2d 364 (1978). Because appellant\u2019s testimony did not describe his reputation in the community either generally or as it would relate to the crimes presently charged, the lower court ruled evidence of these prior crimes inadmissible. Nevertheless, the prosecutor persevered: \u201cAnything happen to you in 1972 that would prevent you from now and evermore from having a license to carry a gun?\u201d A timely objection was sustained.\nClearly, the prosecutor\u2019s question could only have been an improper reference to appellant\u2019s prior criminal conviction and to the concomitant statutory sanction of withdrawal of the privilege to register and carry a weapon under 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6105 which provides: \u201cNo person who has been convicted in this Commonwealth or elsewhere of a crime of violence shall own a firearm, or have one in his possession or under his control.\u201d Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1. There is no other reasonable inference to be drawn. A reference, either expressly or by reasonable implication, to prior criminal activity, which does not qualify as a recognized exception to the general rule excluding evidence of an accused\u2019s prior criminal convictions, see Commonwealth v. Roots, supra; Commonwealth v. Terrell, 234 Pa. Super. 325, 339 A.2d 112 (1975), is impermissible. See Commonwealth v. Penn, 497 Pa. 231, 439 A.2d 1154, 1160 (1982). Moreover, the prosecutor persisted, immediately resuming the same line of questioning:\n[By the Assistant District Attorney]:\nDid you ever apply for a license to carry a gun, Mr. Percell?\nA. No, ma\u2019am.\nQ. Do you know that under the Criminal Law of Pennsylvania you cannot cany a gun on the street without a license?\nA. I didn\u2019t know that.\nQ. You didn\u2019t know that. And didn\u2019t anything occur in 1972 to make you aware of that fact, that on the street you do not and cannot carry a gun without a license?\nA. (No response)\nQ. Are you waiting for your attorney to object, sir?\nA. No. I\u2019m trying to think. Yeah.\nQ. Something did happen?\nA. Uh huh.\n[Defense counsel]: This is objected to, Your Honor. THE COURT: Objection sustained.\n[By the Assistant District Attorney]:\nAll right. Without telling us whatever it was that happened to you in 1972, did you become aware at that time\u2014\n[Defense counsel]: This is objected to, Your Honor. That\u2019s the third time you have warned her.\nTHE COURT: I\u2019m telling you, do not refer to previous matters that do not have anything to do with this case.\n[Assistant District Attorney]: Your Honor, they\u2019re quite relevant and ask to see Your Honor at side bar.\nTHE COURT: They\u2019re not relevant, and I have already ruled.\n(Emphasis supplied).\nIII.\nIn addition to the preceding examples, there were other instances at trial where the prosecutor endeavored to present evidence despite the trial judge\u2019s ruling of inadmissibility. More than a year after the events which appellant assigns as error occurred, the judge denied post trial motions characterizing the prosecutor\u2019s conduct as spirited but de \u25a0minimis infractions of proper courtroom decorum. It would appear the passage of time between the trial and the disposition of post trial motions has dulled the court\u2019s memory, for on the eighth day of trial, the court admonished:\nTHE COURT: Don\u2019t you understand what I\u2019m saying? Now, you\u2019re getting very close to being contemptuous by refusing to listen to what I have to say. Now, you\u2019re getting awfully close. I\u2019m just warning you. The next step, I\u2019ll have Joe Murray over here and I\u2019ll have to tell him everything that I have been disappointed in this trial. Now, I\u2019m not threatening you but I hope you\u2019ll listen to me, and I don\u2019t want \u2014 I\u2019m ruling now that there\u2019s no mistrial up to this point but I don\u2019t know what I will do next.\nTHE COURT: I want you to confer with Mr. Murray about your attitude here, which I think is getting very dangerous. I don\u2019t think you \u2014 it\u2019s sunk in on you yet, that when I tell you something you don\u2019t pay any attention and you somehow have a smile, as if you\u2019re the cat that ate the canary and you\u2019re going to get this dumb judge next; you\u2019ll fool him on this.\n[Assistant District Attorney]: That\u2019s not the case, Your Honor.\nTHE COURT: It certainly is and I hope you\u2019ll change your attitude because I don\u2019t think you think there\u2019s any danger at all, and I assure you you\u2019re getting in very deep waters now and this is a very serious admonition that I\u2019m giving to you to please be careful about the way that you\u2019re handling the case.\nMore than once the court denied appellant\u2019s motion for mistrial on grounds the court believed the assistant district attorney to be acting out of either ignorance of proper trial procedures or failure to understand the court\u2019s rulings. Close review of the record, however, convinces us the prosecutor did understand the court\u2019s rulings but, contending the court had misapplied applicable case law, she chose to ignore the trial judge\u2019s rulings and try the case her way. Such misconduct by an officer of the court cannot be tolerated.\nThis was appellant\u2019s second trial, and it lasted four weeks. After closing arguments, defense counsel again requested a mistrial and the court, understandably reluctant to abandon the fruits of four long, arduous weeks and begin anew, denied the request apparently on the theory the jury might return a verdict untainted by the prosecutor\u2019s conduct, stating, \u201c[A]ny motions for mistrial are denied. It\u2019s ready to go to the jury and we don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do and some of these matters might be subject to post trial motions if we ever get to that stage.\u201d\nWe are convinced that the trial court\u2019s indulgence with the prosecutor has cost appellant a fair trial. The prosecutor\u2019s overly zealous efforts in representing the Commonwealth amounted to intentional misconduct marked by defiant disregard for the law and permeated the trial with an atmosphere of contempt for the court\u2019s rulings. Thus, the court\u2019s rulings and cautionary instructions were inadequate to cure any resulting prejudice inuring to appellant as the result of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct. Therefore, appellant\u2019s request for a new trial is granted.\nReversed and remanded for a new trial.\nMcDERMOTT, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. The panel consisted of then-Chief Justice Michael J. Eagen, the Honorable Sydney Hoffman of Superior Court, and the Honorable Warren K. Hess of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County. Mr. Chief Justice Eagen dissented from the Superior Court\u2019s affirmance of judgments of sentence. This Court then granted review.\n. This was Percell\u2019s second trial. After his first trial by jury, Percell was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and possession of an instrument of crime. Timely motion for a new trial was granted.\n. \u201cIt is unprofessional conduct for a prosecutor knowingly and for the purpose of bringing inadmissible matter to the attention of the judge or jury to offer inadmissible evidence, ask legally objectionable questions, or make other impermissible comments or arguments in the presence of the judge or jury.\u201d ABA Standards for the Prosecution and Defense Function, Standard 3-5.6(b), approved February 12, 1979.\n. Appellant has raised no double jeopardy claim, thus, we express no view as to whether appellant should be discharged."}
