Curiam,\nWe are not convinced that the evidence in this case was sufficient to justify the court in submitting it to the jury, and hence we cannot say there was any error in withdrawing it from their consideration by directing a verdict for the defendant. Finding no error in the rulings of the learned trial judge the judgment should not be disturbed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
