{"id": "1010445", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nAgnew, J.\nThe question in this case is disposed of by the opinion just read in the appeal of Jane E. Plughes, from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia county (ante, p. 177.)\nIt must be remembered, however, that the question could not be raised and decided in an action of ejectment, but belongs exclusively to the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court: Holliday v. Ward, 7 Harris 485. As this, however, is a stated case, and the parties have agreed as to' the judgment to be entered, we aro not disposed to vary the judgment of our brother at Nisi Prius.\nThe judgment is therefore affirmed."}
