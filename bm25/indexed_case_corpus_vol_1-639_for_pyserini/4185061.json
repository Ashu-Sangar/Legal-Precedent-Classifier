The issues, as stated by Petitioner, are:\n(1) Does the en banc Superior Court\u2019s published decision contravene the plain language of the PCRA and precedent by deeming defendant duly diligent in pursuing his claim despite his failure to speak with the recanting witness for fourteen years?\n(2) Does the en banc Superior Court\u2019s published decision contravene precedent by failing to properly consider factors that greatly undermined the reliability of the recantation evidence, and rendered erroneous the determination that it likely would have changed the verdict?\n(3) Does the en banc Superior Court\u2019s published decision contravene precedent by approving an ostensible credibility finding against a key witness whose testimony the PCRA court suppressed?\n(4) Does the en banc Superior Court\u2019s published decision contravene the governing standard by rejecting the Commonwealth\u2019s recusal argument where the PCRA judge\u2019s repeated conduct in sua sponte raising claims on defendant\u2019s behalf created an objective appearance of impropriety?"}
