{"id": "582005", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThe single question raised in this direct appeal from appellant\u2019s conviction of voluntary manslaughter is whether the Commonwealth satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt, in this jury-waived trial, that the gunshot wound concededly inflicted upon the deceased by appellant was the legal cause of death. In all other respects, the sufficiency of the evidence is not challenged. The record on causation consists solely of the prosecution\u2019s uncontradicted medical testimony; the defense offered no conflicting medical evidence. Reviewing the entire record, as we must, in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, Commonwealth v. Lee, 450 Pa. 152, 154, 299 A.2d 640, 641 (1973), we find the evidence of causation sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s conviction. We affirm.\nThe deceased, one Benjamin Holmes, was hospitalized on October 24, 1970. Following surgery to remove the bullet, which had crushed and penetrated Holmes\u2019 spine, several \u201ccomplications\u201d developed\u2014severe anemia, pneumonia, acute respiratory insufficiency, infection of the wound, and acute renal insufficiency. Holmes died on November 13, 1970. The \u201ccomplications\u201d were listed by the hospital as the immediate cause of death.\nAt trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s medical expert testified that but for the complications, the deceased would probably have survived. He further testified that it was possible that the deceased might have had a renal condition prior to the shooting. However he also stated that \u201cthe bullet wound was the underlying cause of all the complications which [Holmes] suffered in this hospitalization.\u201d Moreover, his conclusion as to the cause of death was explicit and unequivocal\u2014\u201cthe deceased died as a result of a gunshot wound of the thorax, the thorax being the technical name for the chest portion of the body.\u201d\nIn affirming, we need only repeat what was said in Commonwealth v. Cheeks, 423 Pa. 67, 73, 223 A.2d 291, 294 (1966), and reiterated many times thereafter by this Court: \u201c[0]ne charged with homicide cannot escape liability merely because the blow he inflicted is not mortal, or the immediate cause of death. If his blow is the legal cause, i.e., if it started a chain of causation which led to the death, he is guilty of homicide.\u201d That the victim here might have had a pre-existing ailment, kidney disease, which was aggravated by treatment of his bullet wound, does not alter the conclusion that the gunshot wound was the legal cause of death. An accused may not escape criminal responsibility on the ground that, prior to the criminal act, his victim, was not in perfect health.. See Commonwealth v. Webb, 449 Pa. 490, 296 A.2d 734 (1972); Commonwealth v. Odom, 448 Pa. 474, 295 A.2d 331 (1972).\nThe Commonwealth has an unvarying burden of proving legal causation beyond a reasonable doubt. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hudson, 455 Pa. 117, 314 A.2d 231 (1974); Commonwealth v. Carn, 449 Pa. 228, 296 A.2d 753 (1972); Commonwealth v. Nole, 448 Pa. 62, 292 A.2d 331 (1972); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 445 Pa. 276, 284 A.2d 734 (1971). The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence clearly supports the court\u2019s finding that the gunshot wound was the legal cause of death. Contrary to the assertions of appellant, this finding is in no way weakened by the medical testimony that the deceased might have had kidney disease and that kidney failure was an immediate cause of death. Nor does this testimony necessarily create a reasonable doubt as to causation. Compare Commonwealth v. Embry, 441 Pa. 183, 272 A.2d 178 (1971), and Commonwealth v. Radford, 428 Pa. 279, 236 A.2d 802 (1968); with Commonwealth v. Amato, 449 Pa. 592, 297 A.2d 462 (1972), and Commonwealth v. Webb, 449 Pa. 490, 296 A.2d 734 (1972).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nThis Court\u2019s jurisdiction is found in the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp. 1973).\nSee, e.g., Commonwealth v. Paquette, 451 Pa. 250, 301 A.2d 837 (1973); Commonwealth v. Stafford, 451 Pa. 95, 301 A.2d 600 (1973); Commonwealth v. Amato, 449 Pa. 592, 297 A.2d 462 (1972); Commonwealth v. Carn, 449 Pa. 228, 296 A.2d 753 (1972); Commonwealth v. Johnson, 445 Pa. 276, 284 A.2d 734 (1971)."}
