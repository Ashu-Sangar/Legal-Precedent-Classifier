{"id": "1100775", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nExceptions were filed in the court below to an adjudication of what the present appellant termed its \u201csecond partial account\u201d as \u201cexecutor\u201d under the will of David Bishop Hand, deceased. Certain of these exceptions were sustained and a change made in the adjudication, which change had the effect of taking funds from one set of distributees and conferring them upon another. Whereupon the accountant, as \u201cexecutor,\u201d took an exception to the confirmation of the account and distribution ordered by the court below, which exception was dismissed. This appeal ensued.'\nAfter studying the record and arguments of counsel, we are not convinced of error, but, even were the. fact otherwise, no relief could be granted here, since appellant lacks standing to attack the adjudication. We early ruled, in Sharp\u2019s Appeal, 3 Grant 260, that the personal representatives of a decedent\u2019s estate usually have \u201cno interest in a question of distribution and...... no right to appeal [from] anything decided in that part of the process. In it the creditors and distributees are alone interested.\u201d See also Mellon\u2019s App., 32 Pa. 121, 130; Stineman\u2019s App., 34 Pa. 394, 395; Craig\u2019s App., 38 Pa. 330; Gallagher\u2019s App., 89 Pa. 29; Behringer\u2019s Estate, 265 Pa. 111, 112; Correll, Receiver\u2019s Account, 283 Pa. 277, 281; Fuhrman\u2019s Est., 21 Pa. Superior Ct. 27, 29; Mays\u2019s Estate, 25 Pa. Superior Ct. 267, 268. The governing rule is well stated in the syllabus to Wick\u2019s Est., 50 Pa. Superior Ct. 614, thus: \u201cAn executor who comes into the court to which he must account, admitting that he has a specific balance in his' hands for distribution, has no standing, as executor, to appeal from the decree of distribution; so long as the decree does not surcharge him or make distribution of an amount larger than the admitted balance due the estate, he is not \u2018a party aggrieved\u2019 within the meaning of [the appellate acts].\u201d\nThe appeal is dismissed, costs to be paid out of the estate."}
