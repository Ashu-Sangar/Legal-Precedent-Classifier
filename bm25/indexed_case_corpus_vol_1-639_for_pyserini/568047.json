{"id": "568047", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThe first four assignments allege error in the charge of the court. A careful examination of the whole charge, in connection with the portions embraced in the assignments, fails to disclose error. The questions of fact involved in the case were fully and fairly submitted to the jury.\nThe fifth assignment alleges error in the admission of testimony. This assignment is not in compliance with the rule of court, and will not be discussed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
