{"id": "1210984", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal is from an order affirming\" the report of an auditor rejecting appellant\u2019s claim for services as housekeeper and nurse rendered to testator during the six-year period immediately prior to the filing of the executors\u2019 account. The claim was rejected for want of proof that she had not been paid periodically in the customary way.\nAppellant and her husband lived with testator, a farmer; her husband did the farm work and received periodic payments, and she did all of the housework and looked after the testator during his illness.\nClaims such as this, which could have been presented during the decedent\u2019s lifetime, are carefully scrutinized: Conrad\u2019s Estate, 333 Pa. 561, 567 et seq., 3 A. 2d 697; the evidence to establish them must be clear and convincing: Gilbraith\u2019s Estate, 270 Pa. 288, 113 A. 361. Where, as here, the services are those of a domestic or nurse, there is a presumption of periodic payments: Mooney\u2019s Estate, 328 Pa. 273, 194 A. 893; Cummiskey\u2019s Estate, 224 Pa. 509, 73 A. 916; Gilbraith\u2019s Estate, supra; Witten v. Stout, 284 Pa. 410, 131 A. 360; Blumberg\u2019s Estate, 115 Pa. Superior Ct. 310, 175 A. 741; Johnson\u2019s Estate, 108 Pa. Superior Ct. 526, 165 A. 535; Bemis v. Van Pelt, 139 Pa. Superior Ct. 282, 11 A. 2d 499. This is especially true where the decedent, like this testator, had the reputation of paying obligations as they became due: compare Gross\u2019 Estate, 284 Pa. 73, 75, 130 A. 304; Collins\u2019 Estate, 83 Pa. Superior Ct. 31.\nThe presumption of payment is rebuttable, but the auditor found, and his finding was affirmed by the court in banc, that the evidence presented by appellant was insufficient to rebut it. The record sustains the finding and we accept it.\nOrder affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
