{"id": "970478", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nA careful examination of this case has failed to convince us that the learned judge below committed error, either in his charge, Or in his rulings upon questions of evidence. It was a case for the jury and was fairly submitted. The verdict was in favor of the plaintiff on policy No. 1,643, and in favor of the defendant on policy No. 2,389. We think that substantial justice has been done, and done in an orderly manner.\nJudgment affirmed."}
