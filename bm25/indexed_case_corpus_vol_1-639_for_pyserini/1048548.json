{"id": "1048548", "contents": "Pee Cubiam,\nThe devise of Perry Stark to his daughter, Georgianna, was absolute, for she survived his wife. His provision that if she should die \u201cleaving no issue of her body living at her death,\u201d then over to certain named persons, was not a limitation or curtailment of the devise, but simply alternative or substitutionary and to take effect only on the death of the daughter in his lifetime: Mickley\u2019s App., 92 Pa. 514; Morrison v. Truby, 145 Pa. 540; McAlpin\u2019s Est., 211 Pa. 26. The fee in the farm of the testator undoubtedly vested in the daughter, and the petition for its partition by one having no interest in it was properly dismissed.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
