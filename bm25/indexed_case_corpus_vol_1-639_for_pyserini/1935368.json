{"id": "1935368", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nIn August of 1967, appellant was indicted for assault and battery, assault with intent to rob, and robbery. The charges all arose out of a purse snatching, the victim of which identified appellant as her assailant. The Commonwealth\u2019s case against appellant was strengthened by the discovery, by the victim, of a card \u2022with appellant\u2019s name on it among her credit cards when her handbag was returned to her. Sometime before October 27,1967, appellant\u2019s counsel and the prosecuting attorney reached an agreement whereby appellant would plead guilty and the Commonwealth would recommend to the judge that appellant be sentenced to eleven and one-half to twenty-three months on the robbery bill and to a year\u2019s probation on the assault and battery bill.\nOn October 27, 1967, appellant\u2019s guilty plea was entered and accepted. Before accepting the plea of guilty, appellant responded to an on-the-record inquiry by the assistant district attorney and stated that no one\u2014his own attorney, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney, or the court\u2014had promised him any specific sentence if he pleaded guilty and that he understood that if he pleaded guilty, he \u201ccould be sent away . . . for a long time.\u201d\nThe trial court first heard evidence as to the offense and evidence as to appellant\u2019s background, including his prior juvenile record, and his history of being a slow learner who had been to a number of different schools and correctional institutions. Although the prosecuting attorney later testified that he had mentioned his promised recommendation to the judge at a side-bar conference, no recommendation of a sentence was made on the record at that time. The trial court decided to defer sentence pending preparation of a presentence report.\nFour months later, on February 29, 1968, a sentence hearing was finally held in appellant\u2019s case. Appellant had then been in jail seven months since his arrest. The other participants had been more active. The prosecuting attorney who had handled the case in its earlier stages, including negotiation of the plea bargain, was no longer assigned to it. The judge, who had probably handled hundreds of cases in the meantime, gave no indication that he was aware of any Commonwealth recommendation as to sentence. The prosecuting attorney now assigned to the case mentioned on the record that there was a recommendation but for some reason, either his timidity or the manner in which the hearing proceeded, was never able to state what the recommendation was. After again interviewing appellant as to his background, the court sentenced him to eighteen months to fifteen years on the robbery bill. Appellant\u2019s counsel suggested a shorter minimum and the assistant district attorney suggested that both the minimum and the maximum be shortened, but at no time did the assistant district attorney make the specific recommendation which his predecessor had promised would be made.\nIn September of 1968, appellant filed a post-conviction petition alleging, inter alia, that his sentence of a fifteen-year maximum was erroneous, as the maximum for simple robbery was ten years, and that his guilty plea was involuntary.\nA hearing was held on appellant\u2019s petition on May 22, 1969. The Commonwealth conceded that the appellant\u2019s sentence was improper and argument was limited to the validity of the plea. Appellant testified that on the morning of trial, the assistant district attorney and his lawyer told him that if he pleaded guilty, the assistant district attorney would recommend a sentence of eleven and one-half to twenty-three months.\nThe assistant district attorney admitted that the bargaining took place and that he agreed on behalf of the Commonwealth that he would recommend a sentence of eleven and one-half to twenty-three months on the robbery bill and a year\u2019s probation on the other bill. The assistant district attorney did not recall telling this directly to appellant, but he did recall making this promise to appellant\u2019s attorney.\nThe post-conviction hearing judge, after listening to the testimony, refused to allow appellant to withdraw his plea. As he explained, at the close of the hearing: \u201cI find the plea to be voluntary in that it was knowingly and intelligently made with the hope and desire that it would resound [sic] to his benefit in sentencing. I \u2022find that there was no promise made.\u201d\nAppellant appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed the decision of the post-trial judge at 216 Pa. Superior Ct. 811, 263 A. 2d 478 (1970). We granted allocatur and now we reverse.\nAn application to withdraw a plea of guilty and enter a plea of not guilty (under the Act of April 15, 1907, P. L. 62, \u00a71, as amended by the Act of June 15, 1939, P. L. 400, \u00a71, 19 P.S. \u00a7241) is addressed to the discretion of the court before which the plea is entered, and its actions will not be reversed unless there has been a clear abuse of that discretionary power. Commonwealth v. Kirkland, 413 Pa. 48, 195 A. 2d 338 (1963).\nIt has already been established that it is a clear abuse of discretion for a court to refuse to allow a defendant to withdraw a plea of guilty, which was bargained for a promise by the district attorney\u2019s office to recommend a specific lenient sentence to the sentencing judge, when the district attorney\u2019s office later reneged on its part of the bargain. Commonwealth v. Todd, 186 Pa. Superior Ct. 272, 142 A. 2d 174 (1958). See also Commonwealth v. Alvarado, 442 Pa. 516, 276 A. 2d 526 (1971).\nThe Commonwealth attempts to distinguish Todd on the grounds that in the instant case the district attorney\u2019s office kept its promise. We cannot accept the Commonwealth\u2019s view of the facts. We have examined the record and we believe that the post-conviction hearing judge\u2019s opinion much more accurately describes what took place. As he wrote: \u201cWhile the record, fails to disclose whether any specific recommendation was made, it does show that, at the time of sentencing at a subsequent hearing, the Court\u2019s attention was called to the fact that a recommendation had been made at the time of the entry of the guilty plea.\u201d\nHowever, even though we agree with the post-conviction court\u2019s view of the facts, we cannot agree with its view of the law. The shy mention by the prosecuting attorney that a recommendation was being made was not what appellant bargained for when he agreed to plead guilty. He bargained for a specific recommendation by the district attorney\u2019s office that he be given an eleven and one-half to twenty-three month sentence. He knew that he could not count on the court being bound by the recommendation, but he had every right to count on the recommendation being made\u2014on the record and audibly so the court could hear it.\nBecause that bargain was not kept in this case, appellant had a right to withdraw his plea. It was an abuse of discretion for the court to refuse to allow him to do so.\nBecause an examination of the record of this case indicates that courts and attorneys may not fully understand our attitude toward plea bargaining, we shall fully state our position, even though it is not necessary for the result we have reached today.\nAt the post-conviction hearing, appellant was interrogated concerning events which occurred involving appellant, his trial counsel and the prosecuting attorney shortly before trial. Interrogation by his own counsel elicited the following: \u201cQ. Did they tell you anything about how you should respond to the question the judge would present before the court? Now, specifically, when the judge said, \u2018Are you doing this voluntarily or have any promises been made to you\u2019 did they tell you how to answer those questions? A. Yes. Q. What did they tell you to say? A. They told me I was being asked, and when asked was there any deal or bargaining made I was to say, no.\u201d\nInterrogation by the counsel for the district attorney\u2019s office elicited this additional testimony: \u201cQ. Mr. Wilkins, you said that in this conference that you had by the elevator, with your attorney and with the district attorney, that somebody told you certain questions that you were going to be asked under oath about whether any promises were made and you were supposed to say, no. Who told you that? A. The district attorney and my counsel. Q. They both told you that? A. Yes.\u201d\nLater, when appellant\u2019s trial counsel was being questioned about the bargain, the representative from the public defender\u2019s office who was representing appellant at the post-conviction hearing asked trial counsel: \u201cQ. .... I mean, all defense lawyers know the situation of a client being promised something. But having to say to the judge there is no promises made. Now, I think all defense attorneys come to that situation, and when they. ...\u201d The court interrupted, and the following took place: \u201cThe Court: You see it is semantics. I don\u2019t think they are proper. You are using the word 'promise\u2019 in two sentences in two different phases of the case. There were no promises made. Mr. Kairys [The Public Defender]: Promise of a recommendation.\n. . . The Court: Well, then complete it by its proper phraseology. Mr. Kairys: Yes, sir. I thought that I did. The Court: Well, you did but the record won\u2019t show it that way. By Mr. Kairys : Q. You were confronted by the situation that a promise was made. The promise of a recommendation with no assurance of a sentence. And yet when the judge asks the client were any promises made, if he doesn\u2019t say, no, the plea won\u2019t be accepted; isn\u2019t that correct? A. I think that you are confusing the word, promise. Promise has in mind, when they ask that question about promise according to my experience is a promise by, that the sentence will be definitely so-and-so. Q. But he hasn\u2019t vindicated [sic] with his Honor what promises fully fit the category. I am saying a promise of recommendation; you know, when the judge says, Were any promises made? Anything told to you that you might get something in return?\u2019 A. I think again you are confusing that word. Me. Katrys : Well, if something is given in return, if something is promised whether it is to give something or a little less something the assurance would be better if the recommendation is something. Now, if you take the word promise and confuse that; didn\u2019t you know that you were going to be confronted with the situation and the judge asking the defendant, Were any promises made?\u2019 And the defendant having to respond. The Cotjet: Well, just ask the question. The question the judge asked was \u2018Had he promised you\u2019\u2014 Mr. Sweeney was the one that put it\u2014\u2018Has he promised you any particular sentence if you pleaded guilty?\u2019 So that the answer was honest when he said, \u2018No, sir.\u2019 There were no promises of any particular sentence.\u201d\nThis entire conversation indicates that there is a feeling among some of the participants in the bargaining process that, although bargaining must be permitted so that courts can dispose of their heavy caseloads, it is not a process to be discussed openly. This is a dangerous attitude which can only breed harmful cynicism and hypocrisy. Since plea bargaining will take place, and since it will be the process by which a great portion of all criminal cases will be concluded, it is important that it be subject to the same process of standardization and review as is the rest of our criminal justice system.\nIn the future, if a defendant or his counsel wish to protect a bargain they received for a plea, when the court asks the defendant if any promises were made to him, the defendant should answer in the affirmative, stating that the district attorney\u2019s office promised that they would make the specific recommendation which had, in fact, been promised. The court should then make it clear to the defendant that he is not bound by the district attorney\u2019s recommendation and at that time allow the defendant to plead guilty or go to trial.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed, the judgment of sentence is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with the views expressed herein.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nMr. Justice Cohen took no part in the decision of this case."}
