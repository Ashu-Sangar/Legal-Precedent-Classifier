{"id": "827930", "contents": "Opinion,\nMb. Justice Stebbett :\nThis case is ruled by Eichelberger v. Barnitz, 9 W. 447; Hackney v. Tracy, 137 Pa. 53, and that line of cases.\nIn the fourth item of his will the testator, Samuel Alexander, bequeathed and devised to his daughter, Elizabeth Alexander, \u201c all the rest and residue of my estate, real, personal, and mixed,.....to be held by her in fee-simple: Provided, nevertheless, that in case she should die without leaving lawful issue, then it is my will that the property above devised to her shall be equally divided amongst the children of my brother, Dr. J. W. Alexander.\u201d\nIn apt words, the devise over to the beneficial plaintiff and other children of Dr. J. W. Alexander, is made to depend upon the death of testator\u2019s daughter Elizabeth, \u201cwithout leaving lawful issue,\u201d which, according to-the established interpretation. of such expressions in a will, means a .general, indefinite failure of issue, and not a failure at the death of the first taker. There is nothing on the face of the will to change the technical meaning of the word \u201c issue,\u201d in the phrase above quoted, or to show that the testator meant \u201c children,\u201d or issue living at a particular period, instead of the whole line of succession. It follows that Elizabeth Alexander took an estate in fee-tail, which, under the operation of the act of 1855, was enlarged to a fee-simple, and thus became subject to her testamentary disposition.\nFor these and other reasons, more fully stated in the opinion of the court below, there was no error in entering judgment, on the case stated, in favor of the defendants.\nJudgment affirmed."}
