{"id": "4184913", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice TODD.\nIn this discretionary appeal, we consider whether the Medical Records Act (\u201cMRA\u201d or \u201cthe Act\u201d), 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 6151-6160, applies to the reproduction of records by pharmacies, and, if so, whether, and under what circumstances, pharmacies may charge customers a flat fee for the reproduction of records. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Act does not apply to pharmacies, and, as a result, we need not address the flat fee issue. In light of our conclusions, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court.\nBriefly, and by way of background, the MRA was enacted in 1986. The Act, as described by this Court,\nrecognizes that a patient has a right to his own medical records; authorizes the use of certified copies of original medical records at trials and other proceedings without the necessity of preliminary testimony respecting foundation, identity and authenticity; streamlines the process for securing copies of medical records; and ... addresses what medical records providers can charge for the copies provided.\nChiurazzi Law Inc. v. MRO Corp., 626 Pa. 303, 97 A.3d 275, 276 (2014).\nNotably, when first enacted, the Act referred only to subpoenas for records served upon employees of \u201chealth care facilities.\u201d Further, the Act did not contain statutory caps on the amount that could be charged for the reproduction of records. In 1998, however, the Act was amended in several respects pertinent to this appeal. First, Section 6152(a)(1) was expanded to include subpoenas served upon a \u201chealth care provider\u201d:\nWhen a subpoena duces tecum is served upon any health care provider or an employee of any health care facility licensed under the laws of this Commonwealth, requiring the production of any medical charts or records at any action or proceeding, it shall be deemed a sufficient response to the subpoena if the health care provider or health care facility notifies the attorney for the party causing service of the subpoena, within three days of receipt of the subpoena, of the health care provider\u2019s or facility\u2019s election to proceed under this subchapter.\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6152(a)(1) (as amended in 1998) (emphasis added to indicate amendments).\nIn addition, the 1998 amendments limited the amount a health care provider or health care facility could charge for the reproduction of medical charts or records by adding the following subsection:\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (ii) [relating to record requests by a district attorney], the health care provider or facility or a designated agent shall be entitled to receive payment of such expenses before producing the charts or records. The payment shall not exceed $15 for searching for and retrieving the records; $1 per page for paper copies for the first 20 pages; 75c per page for pages 21 through 60; and 25c per page for pages 61 and thereafter; $1.50 per page for copies from microfilm; plus the actual cost of postage, shipping or delivery. No other charges for the retrieval, copying and shipping or delivery of medical records other than those set forth in this paragraph shall be permitted without prior approval of the party requesting the copying of the medical records. The amounts which may be charged shall be adjusted annually beginning on January 1, 2000, by the Secretary of Health of the Commonwealth based on the most recent changes in the consumer price index reported annually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor.\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6152(a)(2)(i) (as amended in 1998).\nFinally, Section 6155(b) of the Act was amended to allow a patient\u2019s designee, including his attorney, the right to obtain copies of medical charts and records upon request, without a subpoena, for an amount not in excess of that set forth above in Section 6152(a)(2)(i):\n(b) Rights to records generally.\u2014\n(1) A patient or his designee, including his attorney, shall have the right of access to his medical charts and records and to obtain photocopies of the same, without the use of a subpoena duces tecum, for his own use. A health care provider or facility shall not charge a patient or his designee, including his attorney, a fee in excess of the amounts set forth in section 6152(a)(2)(l) (relating to subpoena of records).\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6155(b)(1) (as amended in 1998). With these relevant sections of the MRA in mind, we turn to the facts of the instant case.\nAppellant Rite Aid of Pennsylvania, Inc. (\u201cRite Aid\u201d) is a Pennsylvania corporation that operates pharmacies throughout the Commonwealth. In or around December 2008, Attorney David A. Landay submitted to Rite Aid an \u201cauthorization\u201d on behalf of an individual, requesting copies of the individual\u2019s pharmacy records. Around the same time, the law firm of Patberg Carmody & Ging (\u201cPC & G\u201d) also submitted an authorization to Rite Aid requesting copies of pharmacy records for an individual. In response to the requests, Rite Aid sent invoices for $50 to both Landay and PC & G (collectively, \u201cAppellees\u201d); both invoices contained the following language:\nFOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES RENDERED IN RESPONSE TO THE FOLLOWING REQUEST/SUBPOENA FOR PRESCRIPTION FILES AS FOLLOWS: RESEARCH & PREPARATION OF FILES, CLERICAL EXPENSES, PHOTOCOPYING EXPENSES AND POSTAGE AND HANDLING.\nRite Aid Invoices, 12/4/08 and 12/3/08. Appellees paid the invoices, and Rite Aid provided the requested copies of the pharmacy records.\nOn March 24, 2010, Appellees filed a class action against Rite Aid. In Count I of the complaint, Appellees claimed that Rite Aid breached an implied agreement between the parties and Rite Aid that Rite Aid would provide copies of its records to its customers in a manner consistent with Pennsylvania law, limiting the amount that may be charged to the estimated actual and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the reproduction of the requested records. Specifically, Appellees maintained that Rite Aid\u2019s act of charging a flat fee for the reproduction of records violates Section 6152(a)(2)(i) of the MRA. In Count II of their complaint, Appellees requested a declaratory judgment that the MRA prohibits Rite Aid from charging more than the reasonable expenses it incurred to reproduce the requested records, and, further, precludes Rite Aid from charging a flat fee.\nRite Aid filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer, asserting the MRA does not apply to the reproduction of pharmacy records because a pharmacy is neither a health care facility nor a health care provider under the Act. Rite Aid alternatively claimed that, even if the MRA does apply to pharmacies, Appellees\u2019 voluntary payment of Rite Aid\u2019s invoices defeated their claims.\nThe trial court, by the Honorable R. Stanton Wettick, Jr., granted Rite Aid\u2019s preliminary objections and dismissed its complaint. In concluding the MRA does not apply to pharmacies, or the reproduction of pharmacy records, Judge Wettick observed that Section 6155(b)(1), from the time it was enacted in 1986, has used the term \u201cpatient,\u201d and that, generally, \u201cpersons describe themselves as patients of the physician who wrote the prescription and customers of the pharmacy that filled the prescription. Persons describe themselves as patients of a hospital but persons do not describe themselves as patients of a pharmacy.\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 5/5/11, at 5. Judge Wettick reasoned that, \u201cby using the term patient, the Legislature was focusing on problems concerning access to the records of hospitals and physicians. I have no reason to believe the same problems existed with respect to records of pharmacies.\u201d Id. at 6 (emphasis original).\nIn a unanimous published opinion, the Superior Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order granting Rite Aid\u2019s preliminary objections, and remanded for further proceedings. Landay v. Rite Aid, 40 A.3d 1280 (Pa.Super.2012). In doing so, the court first stated that it \u201cfail[s] to see any ambiguity in the term \u2018patient.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 1284. The court continued:\nIt is commonly understood that a person for whom a medication has been prescribed by a licensed health care provider is a patient. Nothing in the MRA requires that such a person be a patient of the pharmacy, as the trial court implies by its restrictive definition. However, we would not consider it erroneous to deem such an individual a patient of the dispensing pharmacist, who either owns or works for the pharmacy, as well as the prescribing health care provider.\nId.\nIn support of its interpretation, the Superior Court relied on the Pharmacy Act, 63 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 390-1 et seq., which defines the practice of pharmacy as \u201cthe provision of health care services by a pharmacist,\u201d including, inter alia, \u201cpatient counseling.\u201d See Landay, 40 A.3d at 1284 (quoting 63 P.S. \u00a7 390-2(11)). The court specifically noted that, \u201cas part of their health care duties, pharmacists are authorized to administer injectable medications, biologicals and immunizations.... Thus, the practice of pharmacy is not limited to filling prescriptions.\u201d Id. at 1285.\nIn addition, the Superior Court quoted at length from the Pennsylvania Code, which sets forth the specific duties owed by pharmacists to their patients, see 49 Pa.Code \u00a7 27.19 (adopted March 4,1994), and observed:\nThe language utilized in the Code, as well as the Pharmacy Act, reflects that a pharmacist is a health care provider and that the recipient of the prescription medication is a patient. The Code use of the term \u201cpatient profile,\u201d the requirement that the pharmacist maintain and review the profile, the duty to provide counseling, and the importance of maintaining confidentiality of all information compiled support the conclusion that the pharmacy records are medical records of a patient. A pharmacist is not merely an intermediary between a vendor and consumer. Rather, as noted above, a pharmacist is required to utilize his or her professional education, training, and judgment to provide health care to patients.\nIt is for these reasons we conclude that, under the MRA, a pharmacist is a health care provider, an individual to whom prescription medication is dispensed is a patient, and the patient pharmacy records maintained by the pharmacist are medical records. Accordingly, we hold that the MRA applies to pharmacies.\nId. at 1287-88.\nWith regard to Rite Aid\u2019s assertion that, even if the MRA applies to pharmacies, the parties were free to negotiate their own terms with respect to the charges for the reproduced pharmacy records pursuant to Section 6152(a)(2)(i) of the MRA, the court rejected Rite Aid\u2019s contention that Appellees\u2019 payment of Rite Aid\u2019s invoices vitiated Appellees\u2019 right to challenge the fees under the voluntary payment doctrine. Specifically, the court opined that, because there were no terms or itemization on the invoices, it was unable to conclude that Appellees had \u201cfull knowledge of the facts,\u201d as required for the voluntary payment doctrine to apply. Id. at 1288-89.\nRite Aid filed a petition for allowance of appeal with this Court, which we granted as to the following issues:\n(1) Does the Medical Records Act apply to a pharmacy\u2019s provision of copies of records?\n(2) Under the Medical Records Act, may a pharmacy charge a flat fee for the reproduction of pharmacy records if it gives the customer an invoice setting forth the fee and the customer reviews and pays the invoice without objection before receiving the pharmacy records?\nLanday v. Rite Aid, 621 Pa. 108, 73 A.3d 577 (2013) (order). As these issues raise questions of law, our standard of review is de novo and our scope of review is plenary. Dechert LLP v. Commonwealth, 606 Pa. 334, 998 A.2d 575, 579 (2010).\nRite Aid first contends that the MRA does not apply to pharmacies, or requests for pharmacy records, because the MRA applies only to record requests from health care facilities, and pharmacies are not health care facilities. In support of its position, Rite Aid cites Section 6151 of the Act, titled \u201cUse of certified copies,\u201d which provides:\nMedical charts or records of any health care facility licensed under the laws of this Commonwealth that are susceptible to photostatic reproduction may be proved as to foundation, identity and authenticity without any preliminary testimony, by use of legible and durable copies, certified in the manner provided in this subchapter by the employee of the health care facility charged with the responsibility of being custodian of the originals thereof. These copies may be used in any trial, hearing, deposition or other judicial or administrative action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, in lieu of the original charts or records which, however, the health care facility shall hold available during the pendency of the action or proceeding for inspection and comparison by the court, tribunal or hearing officer and by the parties and their attorneys of record.\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6151 (as enacted 1986) (emphasis added). According to Rite Aid, the language of Section 6151, which was not revised during the 1998 amendments, \u201cmakes clear that the Act applies only to the medical charts or records of a \u2018health care facility licensed under the laws of this Commonwealth.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 13.\nIn arguing that a pharmacy is not a health care facility under the MRA, Rite Aid acknowledges that the term \u201chealth care facility\u201d is not defined in the MRA, but asserts that its meaning is evident when considered in pari materia with the Health Care Facilities Act (\u201cHCFA\u201d), 35 P.S. \u00a7 448.101 et seq. (enacted July 19, 1979), which defines \u201chealth care facility\u201d as follows:\n[A] health care facility includes, but is not limited to, a general, chronic disease or other type of hospital, a home health care agency, a home care agency, a hospice, a long-term care nursing facility, cancer treatment centers using radiation therapy on an ambulatory basis, an ambulatory surgical facility, a birth center regardless of whether such health care facility is operated for profit, nonprofit or by an agency of the Commonwealth or local government. The department shall have the authority to license other health care facilities as may be necessary due to emergence of new modes of health care.\n35 P.S. \u00a7 448.802a. Rite Aid contends that, under the doctrine of ejusdem generis, pharmacies \u201cbear no resemblance to the listed facilities,\u201d and, thus, are not health care facilities. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 14.\nRite Aid acknowledges that the legislature added the term \u201chealth care provider\u201d to specific sections of the MRA, including Sections 6152(a) and (c), 6152.1, and 6155(b), as part of the 1998 amendments to the Act. However, Rite Aid observes that subsections 6152(b) and (d) were not modified at that time, and still refer only to health care facilities. Id. at 20. Rite Aid also emphasizes that no revisions were made to Sections 6151, 6153, 6154, 6155(a), or 6157 of the Act, all of which still reference only health care facilities. Thus, Rite Aid contends that the addition of the term \u201chealth care provider\u201d to limited sections of the MRA should not be viewed as an expansion of the entire scope of the MRA to entities other than health care facilities. Instead, Rite Aid suggests that the addition of the phrase \u201chealth care provider\u201d to certain sections of the MRA merely was intended to bring operators of health care facilities within the category of persons or entities from whom records may be obtained using subpoenas and patient requests. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 22; Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 10. According to Rite Aid, when read as a whole,\nthe Act makes clear that it is dealing only with subpoenas for records of a health care facility, and not subpoenas seeking records of any entity that is not a health care facility. Viewed in this context, the language of Section 6152(a)(1) makes sense only if its reference to a \u201chealth care provider\u201d is read in light of the definition in the HCFA\u2014 one who \u201coperates a health care facility.\u201d 35 P.S. \u00a7 448.103.\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 21.\nRite Aid further argues that, to the extent the term \u201chealth care provider\u201d may be construed more broadly than the term \u201chealth care facility,\u201d the existence of an alternative or expanded definition renders the MRA ambiguous, see, e.g., Delaware Cty. v. First Union Corp., 605 Pa. 547, 992 A.2d 112, 118 (2010) (a statute is ambiguous when there are at least two reasonable interpretations), thereby requiring further resort to statutory construction tools to determine whether the legislature intended the MRA to apply to entities other than health care facilities. Rite Aid asserts that such an analysis demonstrates that the legislature, in amending the MRA, did not intend to expand application of the Act to entities other than health care facilities, but, rather, intended to address concerns about the amount hospitals were charging for the reproduction of medical records. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 28.\nFinally, Rite Aid contends that, even if this Court concludes the MRA does apply to health care providers, a pharmacy cannot be considered a health care provider because the traditional practice of pharmacy, which includes preparing and dispensing drugs to a consumer, is distinct from the practice of medicine. Rite Aid argues the Superior Court erred in concluding pharmacies constitute health care providers under the MRA on the basis of changes in the law that occurred after the 1998 amendments to the Act. Specifically, Rite Aid notes that, at the time of the 1998 amendments, a pharmacist\u2019s main function was to dispense drugs, and it was not until 2002 that pharmacists became authorized to administer injectable medications and vaccines, and not until 2010 that pharmacists became eligible to engage in collaborative drug therapy management with physicians pursuant to 63 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 390-9.2 and 390-9.3. Rite-Aid also suggests that the considerations underlying application of the MRA to hospital records do not \u201creadily apply to other types of health care entities, such as pharmacies,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 34, and submits that the term \u201cmedical records,\u201d as contained in Section 6155(b), is a term of art which is not used when referring to records of prescriptions kept by pharmacies. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 40-41.\nIn response to Rite Aid\u2019s arguments, Appellees maintain that the legislature\u2019s addition of the term \u201chealth care provider\u201d to certain sections of the MRA in 1998, and its use of the term \u201cor\u201d in Section 6155(b)(1), as well as Section 6152(a)(1), demonstrate its intent that the terms \u201chealth care provider\u201d and \u201chealth care facility\u201d have different meanings, and application of the MRA not be limited to health care facilities.\nAppellees further assert that the terms \u201chealth care provider or facility,\u201d \u201cpatient,\u201d and \u201cmedical records or charts,\u201d as contained in Section 6155(b)(1), are unambiguous and \u201creadily susceptible to definition according to common and approved usage.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Brief at 12. In this regard, they contend: (1) a \u201cpatient\u201d is \u201cone who is undergoing medical care and treatment\u201d; (2) the term \u201chealth care\u201d is defined as \u201cefforts to maintain or restore health, especially by trained and licensed professionals\u201d; (3) the term \u201cprovider\u201d means \u201cone that provides health care\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe common and approved definition of the term \u2018health care provider\u2019 is a trained and licensed professional who provides or undertakes efforts to maintain or restore health.\u201d Id. at 12-13. Appellees further offer that the term \u201cmedical record\u201d is commonly understood as \u201ca record of a patient\u2019s medical information (as medical history, care or treatments received, test results, diagnoses, and medications taken).\u201d Id. at 14.\nAppellees observe that the term \u201cpharmacist\u201d is defined under the Statutory Construction Act as \u201c[a]n individual licensed under the laws of this Commonwealth to practice as a pharmacist.\u201d Id. at 14 (quoting 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1991). Appellees further note that \u201cpharmacy\u201d is defined in the dictionary as \u201cthe art, practice or profession of preparing, preserving, compounding and dispensing medical drugs.\u201d Id. (quoting Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary, at 928 (11th ed.2003)). Appellees thus conclude:\n[T]he common and approved meaning of a pharmacist or pharmacy is a person or entity that is licensed under the laws of Pennsylvania to engage in the art, practice or profession of preserving, compounding and dispensing drugs.[ ] From this basic analysis, it is obvious that pharmacists are trained and licensed professionals who are engaged in efforts to maintain or restore the health of those who utilize their services and, therefore, constitute \u201chealth care providers\u201d within the terms of the MRA.\nId. at 14-15.\nBased on the above, Appellees contend the language of the MRA is plain, and, therefore, that it was unnecessary and improper for the Superior Court to engage in further statutory interpretation to determine whether pharmacies are health care providers. Nevertheless, Appellees contend that the Superior Court\u2019s ultimate determination that pharmacists are health care providers for purposes of the MRA was correct. In so arguing, Appellees first note that the basic role of pharmacists in health care has been recognized in Pennsylvania since at least 1961, and that, since 1992, pharmacists have been required to perform a Prospective Drug Review (\u201cPDR\u201d) prior to filling a prescription. Id. at 16-18. Appellees further highlight that, since 2002, pharmacists have been permitted to administer injectable medications, and, since at least 2010, pharmacists have been permitted to engage in collaborative drug therapy management. Id. at 20-21. Appellees also offer that the term \u201cpatient\u201d is consistently used to refer to customers of pharmacies in both the Pharmacy Act and the Pennsylvania Code, and that the prescription profiles and patient profiles that pharmacies are required to maintain in connection with dispensed medications constitute \u201cmedical charts and records\u201d under the MRA.\nFinally, Appellees aver that Rite Aid\u2019s proposed construction of the MRA is erroneous because: it ignores the principle that a change of language in subsequent statutes on the same matter indicates a change of legislative intent; the principle of in pari materia does not apply because there is no ambiguity; and the HCFA and the MRA serve different purposes and address different subject matter, i.e., the safety of on-site premises (the HCFA) compared to the reproduction of medical records (the MRA). Appellees suggest that Rite Aid\u2019s more restrictive construction of the MRA will undermine the Act\u2019s purpose of providing individuals with broad access to their medical records, not only from pharmacies, but also from doctors. They also suggest Rite Aid\u2019s construction will \u201cdestroy established privacy protections of patients,\u201d because \u201c[a] right of access to one\u2019s own personal information is considered a basic part of the right to privacy.\u201d Appellees\u2019 Brief at 44.\nWith these arguments in mind, we begin our analysis. Pursuant to the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1501 et seq., \u201c[t]he object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1921(a). The best indication of the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting a statute may be found in its plain language. Martin v. Com., Dep\u2019t of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing, 588 Pa. 429, 905 A.2d 438, 443 (2006). When interpreting a statute, sections of the statute should be read together and construed to give effect to all of the statute\u2019s provisions. Id. \u00a7 1921(a). Words and phrases \u201cshall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1903(a). Further, we should not interpret statutory words in isolation, but must read them with reference to the context in which they appear. Mishoe v. Erie Ins. Co., 573 Pa. 267, 824 A.2d 1153, 1155 (2003).\nApplying these principles, we first address Rite Aid\u2019s contention that the MRA applies only to health care facilities. It is well settled that we \u201care not permitted to ignore the language of a statute, nor may we deem any language to be superfluous.\u201d Chiurazzi, 97 A.3d at 292 (citation omitted). Thus, although Rite Aid attempts to minimize the import of the legislature\u2019s addition of the term \u201chealth care provider\u201d to Sections 6152(a) and (c), 6152.1, and 6155(b) of the MRA by noting that the same language was not added to Sections 6151, 6152(b) or (d), 6153, 6154, 6155(a), and 6157, all of which still refer only to health care facility, the fact that the legislature added that language in 1998 demonstrates that it envisioned some distinction between health care facilities and health care providers.\nDetermining the legislature\u2019s intent as to the meaning of \u201chealth care provider\u201d proves to be a more difficult task. Regrettably, the MRA defines neither the term \u201chealth care facility,\u201d nor the term \u201chealth care provider.\u201d Further, as the trial court recognized, there is little legislative history with respect to the 1998 amendments to the MRA. See Trial Court Opinion, 5/5/11, at 5. However, observing that Section 6152(a)(1) refers to \u201cany health care provider or an employee of any health care facility licensed under the laws of this Commonwealth,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6152(a)(1), Rite Aid suggests the MRA should be construed in pari materia with the HCFA, as both statutes relate \u201cto the same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things\u201d \u2014 namely, records of health care facilities licensed under the laws of Pennsylvania. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 23; see 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1932. In this regard, Rite Aid contends that the term \u201chealth care provider,\u201d as contained in the MRA, should be construed in the same manner as the term \u201chealth care provider\u201d is defined in the HCFA: \u201cAn individual, a trust or estate, a partnership, a corporation (including associations, joint stock companies and insurance companies), the Commonwealth, or a political subdivision or instrumentality (including a municipal corporation or authority) thereof, that operates a health care facility.\u201d 35 P.S. \u00a7 448.103 (as amended in 1992) (emphasis added).\nWhen construing a statute, we must ascertain the intent of our legislature based on the law at the time the statute was enacted or amended. HSP Gaming, L.P. v. City of Phila., 598 Pa. 118, 954 A.2d 1156, 1182 (2008). At the time of the 1998 amendments to the MRA, several statutes contained definitions of the term \u201chealth care provider.\u201d As discussed above, pharmacies were not included under the definition of \u201chealth care provider\u201d in the HCFA. Pharmacies also were not included under the definition of \u201chealth care provider\u201d under 40 P.S. \u00a7 991.1201 (Uniform Health Insurance Claim Form). Conversely, at the time of the 1998 amendments, pharmacists were included under the definition of \u201cProfessional health care provider\u201d contained in the Peer Review Protection Act, 63 P.S. \u00a7 425.2, and under the definition of \u201chealth care provider\u201d in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 29.\nFor the following reasons, we agree with Rite Aid that it is appropriate to construe the MRA in pari materia to the HCFA. Pursuant to Section 1932 of the Statutory Construction Act, \u201c[s]tatutes or parts of statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things,\u201d and \u201cshall be construed together, if possible, as one statute.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1932.\nAs Rite Aid emphasizes, Section 6152(a)(1) refers to \u201cany health care provider or an employee of any health care facility licensed under the laws of this Commonwealth,\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6152(a)(1) (emphasis added), and it is the Department of Health, under the HCFA, which is responsible for issuing licenses. See 35 P.S. \u00a7 448.806(a) (\u201cNo person shall maintain or operate or hold itself out to be a health care facility without first having obtained a license therefor issued by the department. No health care facility can be a provider of medical assistance services unless it is licensed by the department and certified as a medical assistance provider.\u201d).\nMoreover, the MRA provides specific limits on what a health care provider or facility may charge for the reproduction of medical records, see Chiurazzi, and one of the duties of the Department of Health under the HCFA is to promote cost efficiency and access in the area of health care. See, e.g., 35 P.S. \u00a7 448.202; Rehab Hosp. Services Corp. v. Health Systems Agency of Southwestern Pa., 82 Pa.Cmwlth. 147, 475 A.2d 883, 887 (1984) (noting that, in enacting the HCFA, the legislature clearly was concerned with rising health care costs). Thus, at least one of the goals of both the MRA and the HCFA relates to cost containment in the area of health care.\nIn contrast, the Peer Review Protection Act pertains to, inter alia, the procedure for evaluating \u201cthe quality and efficiency of services ordered or performed by other professional health care providers,\u201d including individual pharmacists. 63 P.S. \u00a7 425.2. Further, as this Court has explained, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act was designed, inter alia, to \u201ccompensate claimants for earnings loss occasioned by work-related injuries,\u201d and \u201cto provide recompense commensurate with the damage from accidental injury, as a fair exchange for relinquishing every other right of action against the employer.\u201d Tooey v. AK Steel Corp., 623 Pa. 60, 81 A.3d 851, 857 (2013) (citations omitted). These statutes are designed to insure the quality of health care services, and to compensate injured individuals, respectively; the focus is not on limiting health care costs.\nThus, upon review of the subjects of the statutes that, in 1998, contained a definition of the term \u201chealth care provider,\u201d we agree with Rite Aid that the MRA should be construed in pari materia with the HCFA. As a result, we interpret the term \u201chealth care provider,\u201d as contained in the MRA, according to the definition of \u201chealth care provider\u201d set forth in the HCFA. Interpreting the MRA\u2019s use of the term \u201chealth care provider\u201d in this manner, we conclude that pharmacies are not health care providers under the MRA, as they are not entities that operate a health care facility. See 35 P.S. \u00a7 448.103.\nWe recognize, as Appellees argue, that many statutes that concern the release of medical information now specifically include pharmacies within the definition of \u201chealth care provider.\u201d See, e.g., Pennsylvania eHealth Information Technology Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 510.101 (enacted July 5, 2012) (concerning \u201cconsent and confidentiality of health information; and establishing civil immunity under certain circumstances,\u201d and expressly including a pharmacy under the definition of \u201cHealth Care Provider\u201d); Anatomic Pathology Service Disclosure Act, 63 P.S. \u00a7 426.2 (enacted Nov. 23, 2010) (defining \u201cHealth care provider\u201d as including, inter alia, a physician, hospital, health care facility, and pharmacist). However, these statutes were enacted subsequent to the 1998 amendments to the MRA, and, therefore, may not alter our conclusion as to the legislature\u2019s intent in 1998.\nFor similar reasons, we conclude that, even if Appellees are correct that the term \u201chealth care provider\u201d means more than just a health care facility or operator thereof, pharmacies do not constitute health care providers under the MRA. As discussed above, in support of their position that pharmacies constitute health care providers, Appellees rely, in great part, on the fact that pharmacists currently are permitted to administer injectable medications and engage in collaborative drug therapy management. The Superior Court also recognized these services provided by pharmacies, and further noted that, based on the language used to define the practice of pharmacy under the Pharmacy Act, a pharmacy customer is considered a patient.\nIt is beyond dispute that there has been a substantial increase in the scope of services offered by pharmacies since the 1998 amendments to the MRA. However, at the time of the amendments, pharmacists were not authorized to perform the types of health care services identified by Appellees and the court below. Indeed, it was not until 2002 that pharmacists became authorized to administer injectable medications and vaccines, and it was not until 2010 that pharmacists were permitted to engage in collaborative drug therapy management with licensed physicians in a setting other than an institutional setting.\nAdditionally, prior to 1998, the \u201cpractice of pharmacy\u201d was defined in the Pharmacy Act as follows:\nThe practice of that profession concerned with the art and science of the evaluation of prescription orders and the preparing, compounding and dispensing of drugs and devices, whether dispensed on the prescription of a medical practitioner or legally dispensed or provided to a consumer, and shall include the proper and safe storage and distribution of drugs, the maintenance of proper records, the participation in drug selection and drug utilization reviews, and the responsibility of relating information as required concerning such drugs and medicines and their therapeutic values and uses in the treatment and prevention of disease.\n63 P.S. \u00a7 390-2 (1985) (emphasis added). Thus, at the time of the 1998 amendments to the MRA, a consumer of a pharmacy was not referred to as a patient of the pharmacy, and the definition of the practice of pharmacy under the Pharmacy Act did not include \u201cthe provision of health care services\u201d or patient counseling. Rather, a pharmacist\u2019s duties were limited to the preparation, compounding, dispensing, storage, and distribution of drugs, record maintenance, and the provision of information related to drugs and devices.\nAs noted above, when construing a statute, we must ascertain the intent of our legislature based on the law at the time the statute was enacted or amended. HSP Gaming, supra. Thus, even under Appellees\u2019 proposed construction of the term \u201chealth care provider,\u201d at the time of the 1998 amendments, pharmacies did not constitute \u201chealth care providers\u201d for purposes of the MRA. Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court.\nOrder reversed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nFormer Justice McCAFFERY did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices SAYLOR, EAKIN, BAER and STEVENS join the opinion.\n. In 2012, the amounts allowable under Section 6152(a)(2)(i) were increased as follows: $20.62 for searching for and retrieving the records, $1.39 per page for the first 20 pages, $1.03 per page for pages 21 through 60, and 34c per page for pages 61 and thereafter for paper copies or reproductions on electronic media whether the records are stored on paper or in electronic format; $2.04 per page for copies from microfilm; plus the actual cost of postage, shipping or delivery. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6152(a)(2)(i) (2012).\n. Prior to the 1998 amendments, Section 6155(b) provided:\nA patient shall have the right of access to all of his medical charts and records and to photocopy the same for his own use.\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6155 (as enacted in 1986).\n. The individuals both are identified in the record only as \"Patient A.\u201d\n. Although the Superior Court indicated that it was \"constrained to disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion\u201d regarding ambiguity, it does not appear that the trial court found the language of Section 6155 to be ambiguous in the first instance; indeed, the trial court rejected the parties\u2019 discussion of other legislation and regulations, and stated that it \"base[d its] ruling on the language of \u00a7 6155(b).\u201d Trial Court Opinion, 5/5/11, at 5.\n. We note that the Superior Court held only that a pharmacy was a health care provider under the MRA; it did not conclude that pharmacies were health care facilities. Further, Appellees do not argue that a pharmacy is a \"health care facility\" under the Act.\n. Section 6152.1 of the Act provides for a limit on the amount a \"health care provider or facility\u201d may charge for the reproduction of medical charts or records when the charts or records are requested for the purpose of supporting a claim or appeal under any provision of the Social Security Act, or any federal or state financial needs-based benefit program. 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6152.1 (as enacted in 1998).\n. Subsections 6152(b) and (d) provide, respectively:\n(b) Notice to other parties. \u2014 Upon this notification, the attorney causing the service of the subpoena shall notify all other attorneys of record or other parties, if they are not represented by attorneys, of the health care facility\u2019s election.\n(d) Certification. \u2014 The certification shall be signed before a notary public by the employee of the health care facility charged with the responsibility of being custodian of the records and shall include the full name of the patient, the patient\u2019s medical record number, the number of pages in the medical records and a legend....\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 6152(b) and (d) (as enacted in 1986).\n. Section 6153, entitled \"Receipts,\u201d provides in relevant part:\nWhen the copies of records are personally delivered a receipt shall be presented to the person receiving the records for his signature and shall be immediately signed and returned to the person delivering the records. The receipt shall contain the name of the health care facility, the full name of the patient, the date the copies of records were received and the signature of the person receiving the records.\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6153 (as enacted in 1986).\n. Section 6154, titled \"Affidavit of none or partial possession,\" provides:\nIf the health care facility has none of the charts or records specified in the subpoena, or only a part thereof, the custodian of the charts or records shall so state in a notarized affidavit and, following notice and payment of expenses, shall hold available the original charts or records which are in the health care facility's custody specified in the subpoena and shall deliver the certified copies together with the affidavit.\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6154 (as enacted in 1986).\n. Subsection 6155(a) provides:\n(a) Protective order. \u2014 Any patient whose medical charts or records are copied and delivered pursuant to this subchapter, any person acting on such patient\u2019s behalf and the health care facility having custody of the charts or records shall have standing to apply to the court or other body before which the action or proceeding is pending for a protective order denying, restricting or otherwise limiting access to and use of the copies or original charts and records.\n42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6155(a) (as enacted in 1986).\n. Section 6157, titled \"Retention of records,\" provides, in part, \"When the records are received by the clerk of a court or other body from a health care facility or from a party or his attorney of record, they shall be retained in the clerk\u2019s custody at all times except when actually used in the action or proceeding.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6157 (as enacted in 1986).\n. Collaborative drug therapy management permits a pharmacist, inter alia, to \"enter into a written collaborative agreement with a licensed physician authorizing the management of drug therapy for a disease or for a condition or symptom of a disease before practicing the management of drug therapy in a setting other than an institutional setting.\u201d 63 P.S. \u00a7 390-9.3(a).\n. The Pennsylvania Pharmacists Association (\"PPA\") and the National Association for Chain Drug Stores (\"NACDS\u201d) filed a joint amicus brief in support of Rite Aid, wherein they echo Rite Aid\u2019s assertion that the Superior Court, in construing the meaning of the terms \"health care provider\u201d and \"health care facility,\u201d should have focused on the legislature\u2019s intent at the time it enacted and amended the MRA, and that any regulations allowing pharmacists to administer vaccines or engage in other health care services enacted after the 1998 amendments to the Act are not relevant. Additionally, PPA/NACDS cites to several states, including Louisiana, Ohio, and Indiana, which specifically include pharmacists in the definition of health care provider, and they suggest that Pennsylvania\u2019s failure to do the same demonstrates the legislature's intention that the MRA not apply to pharmacies. They further maintain that pharmacy records are not equivalent to other medical records, and they point out that, by law, pharmacy records must be provided to the customer at the time a prescription is filled. See 49 Pa.Code \u00a7 27.18(d).\n. The Pennsylvania Association for Justice (\"PAJ\u201d) has filed an amicus brief in support of Appellees. PAJ contends that, based on the educational and licensing requirements of pharmacists, and the fact they are authorized to render medical services, such as administering vaccines, pharmacists should be considered providers of health care services, and, therefore, subject to the MRA.\n. The only term expressly defined in the MRA is \"Insurer.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6160.\n. See 40 P.S. \u00a7 991.1201 (defining \u201chealth care provider\u201d as \u201c[a] person, corporation, facility, institution or other entity licensed, certified or approved by the Commonwealth to provide health care or professional medical services. The term includes, but is not limited to, a physician, a professional nurse, a certified nurse-midwife, podiatrist hospital, nursing home, ambulatory surgical center or birth center.\u201d).\n. See 63 P.S. \u00a7 425.2 (defining \u201cprofessional health care provider\u201d as \u201cindividuals or organizations who are approved, licensed or otherwise regulated to practice or operate in the health care field under the laws of the Commonwealth, including, but not limited to, the following individuals or organizations: ... (vii) a pharmacist.\u201d)\n. See 77 P.S. \u00a7 29 (defining \"health care provider\u201d as \"any person, corporation, facility or institution licensed or otherwise authorized by the Commonwealth to provide health care services, including, but not limited to, any physician, coordinated care organization, hospital, health care facility, dentist, nurse, optometrist, podiatrist, physical therapist, psychologist, chiropractor or pharmacists and an officer, employe or agent of such person acting in the course and scope of employment or agency related to health care services.\u201d)\n. In Chiurazzi, we explained that the language and structure of the MRA \"plainly suggests that the pricing schedule serves as a cap on the actual and reasonable expenses of reproduction [of medical records.]\u201d 97 A.3d at 294.\n. Entitled \u201cEncouragement of competition and innovation,\u201d 35 P.S. \u00a7 448.202 provides:\nThe department shall in its planning and review activities foster competition to promote cost efficiency, quality and access to care. The department shall encourage cooperative health care arrangements which focus on the health care needs of a health planning area and foster the prudent and economical control of the area\u2019s resources. The department shall also encourage innovations in the financing and delivery systems for clinically related health services that will promote economic behavior by consumers and providers of clinically related health services that leads to appropriate investment in, supply and use of health services.\n35 P.S. \u00a7 448.202.\n. As discussed supra, the Superior Court relied, inter alia, on the use of the term \"patient profile\u201d and the requirement that pharmacists offer \"patient counseling\u201d under 49 Pa.Code \u00a7 27.19 (\"Prospective drug review and patient counseling\u201d) to conclude that a pharmacist is a health care provider, an individual to whom prescription medication is dispensed is a patient, and the patient pharmacy records maintained by the pharmacist are medical records under the MRA:\nThe Code use of the term \u201cpatient profile,\u201d the requirement that the pharmacist maintain and review the profile, the duty to provide counseling, and the importance of maintaining confidentiality of all information compiled support the conclusion that pharmacy records are medical records of a patient.\nLanday, 40 A.3d at 1287. However, the term \"patient\u201d is not defined in 49 Pa.Code \u00a7 27.1 (\"Definitions\u201d), and we are unable to conclude that the term \"patient\u201d referred to in the Code means a patient of a pharmacy, as opposed to a patient of a \"medical practitioner,\u201d which is defined as a \"physician, dentist, veterinarian or other individual authorized and licensed by law to prescribe drugs.\u201d Id.\n. In light of our determination that pharmacies are not health care providers for purposes of the MRA, we need not address the issue of whether, or under what circumstances, a pharmacy would be permitted under the MRA to charge a flat fee for the reproduction of records."}
