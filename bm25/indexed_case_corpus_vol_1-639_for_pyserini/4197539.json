{"id": "4197539", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nWe granted allocatur on the following questions:\n1. Did the Commonwealth Court err by interpreting the \u201cLeave for service with a collective bargaining organization\u201d Section 8102 of the Retirement Code as preventing Petitioners from receiving full credit for the final average salaries they earned while serving as officers in a collective bargaining organization?\n2. Did the Commonwealth Court err by holding that Petitioners\u2019 salaries artificially enhanced or inflated their retirement benefits?\nKirsch v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Public School Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, 597 Pa. 222, 951 A.2d 257 (2008) (Table). For the following reasons, we affirm the Commonwealth Court, finding the statute allows only the salary corresponding with the position held at the school district during the approved leave be credited to the retiree\u2019s retirement earnings; inclusion of increased, union-provided compensation artificially and impermissibly enhances or inflates retirement benefits under the Retirement Code, 24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8101 et seq.\nAppellants are former employees of the Philadelphia School District; each belonged to a local union which had a collective bargaining agreement with the School District. Appellants participated in the Public School Employees Pension Plan made available to public school employees under the Code and administered by the Public School Employees Retirement System (PSERS). See 24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8302, 8306. Under the Plan, participants earn pension credits for each year served in the school system and may receive retirement payments from a joint pension funded by contributions by the school district to PSERS on their behalf. Id. Upon retirement, an employee\u2019s benefits are based on years of service and the average salary in the last years of employment. Id., \u00a7 8102.\nAppellants were granted an approved leave of absence to serve their respective unions in executive positions for the 1999 through 2004 school years. Pursuant to \u00a7 8102 of the Code, a school employee granted such leave is guaranteed the same compensation and benefits as if he had remained in active, full-time service with the employing school district. During a leave of absence, employees continue to receive compensation from the school district; the labor union then reimburses the school district for such salary, pension, retirement contributions, and other benefits due the employee on leave. Employees on approved leave continue to participate in PSERS through contributions made by the employing school district on their behalf.\nWhile employee salary is generally based on a standard schedule and negotiated through a collective bargaining agreement between the School District and unions, the compensation paid to appellants while on leave was annually renegotiated between the School District and the unions. In other school districts, when employees take a similar leave of absence for union service, only the salary that would have been earned had the leave not occurred is reported for retirement purposes. Prior to the 2001-2002 school year, the School District reported to PSERS an amount consistent with the standard salaries each appellant would have earned had he remained in full-time employment with the School District.\nHowever, during the 2000-2001 school year and thereafter, appellants\u2019 salaries reported by the School District for PSERS purposes were altered to reflect the significantly higher salary paid by the unions. Appellants were compensated at a rate 44% to 55% higher than the amount they would have received had they continued their regular employment with the School District.\nIn 2004, appellants chose not to return to their School District positions, and all appellants except Doyle filed retirement applications with PSERS. In determining appellants\u2019 final average salaries for annuity calculations, PSERS determined the increased salaries appellants earned through the union while on approved leave from the School District should not be included when calculating retirement benefits. PSERS concluded \u00a7 8102 permitted only the salary level corresponding with the position held at the School District during the leave to be credited to appellants\u2019 retirement earnings. The decision to base appellants\u2019 retirement calculation solely on earnings commensurate with the scheduled school salary significantly affected appellants\u2019 retirement packages. The final average salaries differed by amounts ranging from $26,805 to $34,059, and retirement benefits differed 38 to 79%.\nAppellants appealed PSERS\u2019s decision, asserting the retirement calculations should include additional credit for the salaries they received for their respective union services, rather than the amount they would have received had they not taken a leave of absence. The Public School Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, the governing body of PSERS and appellee in this action, rejected appellants\u2019 contentions and denied their request to have the higher compensation included for retirement purposes. See Board Order, 12/11/06.\nThe Commonwealth Court affirmed, finding the plain language of \u00a7 8102 supported the conclusion that \u201cretirement credit is authorized only for the salary paid \u2018as if \u2018or to the same degree in which\u2019 the member were in full-time service to the school district and not for any salary paid in excess of that amount.\u201d Kirsch v. Public School Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, 929 A.2d 663, 669 (Pa.Cmwlth.2007). The court further found appellants were not school employees during their leave, but were instead employed by their respective unions. Thus, any salary received during that period was over and above any salary they would have received had they remained in their School District positions, and constituted an artificial inflation of compensation \u2014 which pursuant to \u00a7 8102 should not be included in their final average salary calculations. Id., at 670-71.\nThe issues before us are purely those of statutory interpretation; accordingly, our scope of review is plenary. Pennsylvania School Boards Association, Inc. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Public School Employees\u2019 Retirement Board, 580 Pa. 610, 863 A.2d 432, 436 (2004). \u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). \u201cWhen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, they are presumed to be the best indication of legislative intent.\u201d Chanceford Aviation Properties, L.L.P. v. Chanceford Township Board of Supervisors, 592 Pa. 100, 923 A.2d 1099, 1104 (2007) (citation omitted). We have recently stated:\nTo determine the meaning of a statute, a court must first determine whether the issue may be resolved by reference to the express language of the statute, which is to be read according to the plain meaning of the words. It is only when the words of the statute are not explicit on the point at issue that resort to statutory construction is appropriate. However, basic principles of statutory construction demand that when the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit, and legislative history may be considered only when the words of a statute are not explicit.\nCommonwealth v. Fedorek, 596 Pa. 475, 946 A.2d 93, 98-99 (2008) (citing Commonwealth v. Dellisanti, 583 Pa. 106, 876 A.2d 366, 369 (2005)).\nWe first consider whether the Commonwealth Court erred by interpreting the \u201c[l]eave for service with a collective bargaining organization\u201d definition of \u00a7 8102 as preventing appellants from receiving benefits based on the salaries they earned as union officers. Neither party disputes each appellant is entitled to credited service for the years of approved absence; the task before us is simply to determine what level of pay should be included for purposes of retirement benefits calculations under the Code.\nUnder \u00a7 8342 of the Code, that calculation is as follows: an eligible member is entitled to a \u201cmaximum single life annuity attributable to his credited service and equal to the sum of the ... single life annuities beginning at the effective date of retirement[.]\u201d 24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8342. A \u201c[standard single life annuity\u201d is \u201can annuity equal to 2% [or 2.5% depending on the class] of the final average salary, multiplied by the total number of years and fractional part of a year of credited service of a member.\u201d Id., \u00a7 8102. \u201cFinal average salary\u201d is based upon the highest average compensation received as an active member during any three non-overlapping periods of 12 consecutive months. Id.\nSection 8102 of the Code sets particular requirements regarding the compensation to be awarded to those taking-approved leave and defines \u201c[l]eave for service with a collective bargaining organization\u201d as:\nPaid leave granted to an active member by an employer for purposes of working full time for or serving full time as an officer of a Statewide employee organization or a local collective bargaining representative ... [provided ... the employer shall fully compensate the member, including, but not limited to, salary, wages, pension and retirement contributions and benefits, other benefits and seniority, as if he were in full-time active service; and that the employee organization shall fully reimburse the employer for such salary, wages, pension and retirement contributions and benefits and other benefits and seniority.\nId.\nAppellants contend both the Board and the Commonwealth Court erred as a matter of law by relying upon the wrong-definition in \u00a7 8102 to determine what amounts should be included in their benefit calculations. Appellants argue the \u201c[l]eave for service with a collective bargaining organization\u201d definition controls only whether school district employees should receive credit for the time they were absent to work for their union. They assert the determination of what portion of the salainj paid may be used to calculate benefits is controlled by the definition of \u201c[ajverage final salary,\u201d which puts no limit on the amount of compensation.\nIn response, the Board claims it has consistently interpreted the definition of \u201c[l]eave for service with a collective bargaining organization\u201d as providing only the salary which would have been earned as a full-time School District employee. It contends the \u201c[l]eave for service\u201d definition contains a compensation implication, as the definition itself expressly provides a list of the types of compensation an employer must provide an employee on leave, and restricts that compensation to the amount it would be \u201cas if he were in full-time active service.\u201d Id.\nWe find the Board\u2019s argument persuasive. While the definition of \u201c[l]eave for service with a collective bargaining organization\u201d controls whether an employee should receive credit for years on leave, the definition provides more than just an index of requirements to be satisfied in order for an employee to receive retirement credit. It also provides a detailed list of what forms of compensation must be paid by both the employer and the collective bargaining organization. Considering the detail on this point provided by the General Assembly, it is clear the definition concerns not only whether an employee qualifies for leave, but also the amount of compensation and retirement credit to be received while serving outside the regular position on approved leave. The Commonwealth Court did not err by considering the \u201c[l]eave for service with a collective bargaining organization\u201d definition in determining the amount of approved leave compensation to be included in appellants\u2019 retirement calculations.\nAppellants assert, however, even if the \u201c[l]eave for service\u201d definition controls, the Commonwealth Court failed to correctly interpret it. Appellants interpret the definition that school employees be paid \u201cas if\u201d they had remained in their School District position to mean they must be paid \u201cin the same manner,\u201d not \u201cin the same degree,\u201d as the Board concluded. Appellants note the Code should be liberally interpreted in favor of retirees, see Pennsylvania School Board Association, Inc., at 437; they contend the phrase \u201cas if\u2019 is commonly interpreted as \u201cin the same manner\u201d and thus, under a liberal interpretation in their favor, the higher, union-paid salary should be included in the final average salary computation.\nThe Board claims appellants\u2019 interpretation of \u201cas if\u2019 is so amorphous as to be meaningless, and maintains the definition intends to address the substantive question of the amount of compensation to be paid an employee on leave, not the procedural question of the manner of payment. Accordingly, the Board asserts the \u201cas if\u2019 language should be interpreted to mean the amount the employee would have received had he or she remained in his or her original School District position.\nAgain, we find the Board\u2019s interpretation persuasive. While the Code should be construed liberally in favor of the retiree, such construction cannot violate the plain, unambiguous language of the Code itself. Id., at 441 (citations omitted). Although the General Assembly did not expressly limit the salary to be paid to union officials on leaves of absence, the most common interpretation of the language used, \u201cas if,\u201d denotes the idea of \u201cto the same degree\u201d and is not most commonly used to mean \u201cin the same manner.\u201d An overall, contextual reading of the statute cannot support the interpretation that it merely refers to the method by which the employees would be compensated, rather than the amount they would receive. It would be illogical to suppose the General Assembly intended to dictate the ministerial matter of the manner in which employees were paid, but not deal with the obvious question of how much. This is especially true considering the definition deals with what constitutes payment, and details nothing regarding how \u2014 i.e., the physical method or transactional procedure \u2014 that payment might be provided.\nCode Regulations provide further support for our decision. They state proper contributions for credited service:\nwill be granted to an active member for an approved leave of absence as authorized under sections 8102 and 8302 of the Retirement Code ... based on the salary the member would have received had the member been in regular full-time employment with the employer during the period of the leave.\n22 Pa.Code \u00a7\u00a7 213.2, (b)(2) (emphasis added).\nOur reading of the statute is further supported by its legislative background. Prior to 1992, retirement credit for leave of service with a collective bargaining organization was not permitted under the Code. In a 1983 official opinion, the Attorney General advised the Board \u201ca person on leave from his or her employment as a public school employee to work full-time for a public school employee labor union is not entitled to active membership in the [PSERS].\u201d Official Opinion of Attorney General\u2019s Office, 10/19/83. Responding to the Attorney General\u2019s opinion, the General Assembly amended the definition of \u201c[a]pproved leave of absence\u201d to include \u201cservice with a collective bargaining organization.\u201d See Act of November 30, 1992, P.L. 737, No. 112; see also Act of April 29, 1994, P.L. 159, No. 29.\nConsidering the language of the amended definition, clearly the General Assembly meant to benefit the employee, who otherwise would have received no retirement benefits by choosing to work for a union; it also benefits the union by allowing it to avail itself of the service of its members. The purpose of the amendments was obviously to remove any impediments which precluded retirement service credit from being attributed to employees on leave of absence to serve the union.\nHowever, nothing in the amended language suggests the General Assembly meant for union employees to receive greater retirement benefits than other union members who chose to stay in their school positions or are not given the opportunity to work for the union. Rather, the amendments suggest the General Assembly\u2019s intent was to equalize the playing field by providing retirement benefits for school employees regardless of whether they serve outside the school for a limited time.\nHaving considered the Code\u2019s plain language and applicable regulation in light of its legislative background and purpose, we hold the Commonwealth Court did not err in finding the Code precluded appellants from receiving credit for the higher salaries they were paid while serving as union executives.\nWe next consider whether the Commonwealth Court erred in holding the increased compensation the unions provided to appellants artificially inflated their retirement benefits, and therefore should not be included in the final average salary calculations pursuant to \u00a7 8102. \u201cThe restrictive definitions of compensation under the Retirement Code and regulations reflect the Legislature\u2019s intention to preserve the actuarial integrity of the retirement fund by \u2018excluding] from the computation of employes\u2019 final average salary all payments which may artificially inflate compensation for the purpose of enhancing retirement benefits.\u2019 \u201d Christiana v. Public School Employes\u2019 Retirement Board, 543 Pa. 132, 669 A.2d 940, 944 (1996) (citations omitted); 24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8102.\nAppellants contend the Commonwealth Court erred in finding any increase of salary received during the approved leave of absence constituted an artificial inflation of compensation. See Kirsch, at 671. They assert the Board may only refuse to consider the full amount of compensation paid to an employee from the final average salary calculation if it finds the employee was paid \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of enhancing compensation. See 24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8102. Appellants point out the Board found no evidence to support a finding the higher salaries were established for retirement purposes, thus precluding it from determining the higher, union-approved salaries were set at an artificially high amount for the purpose of enhancing the employees\u2019 retirement benefits.\nThe Board counters that the union officers\u2019 salaries were substantially above the standard salary schedule for the School District positions from which leave was granted, and therefore are not within the definition of \u201c[cjompensation\u201d under the Code. The Board cites Christiana, where this Court recognized the Boards responsibility to guarantee the actuarial soundness of the retirement fund. To further this responsibility, \u201cthe Board has determined that it is statutorily required to exclude nonregular remuneration, nonstandard salary, fringe benefits, bonuses, and severance payments from inclusion as compensation under the Retirement Code. The Board has developed the concepts of \u2018standard salary\u2019 and \u2018regular remuneration\u2019 as part of its understanding of compensation.\u201d Christiana, at 945 (emphasis added).\nWe agree the salaries not based on the standard salary schedule constitute an artificial inflation of compensation for purposes of retirement benefits calculations. Under the Code, \u201cCompensation\u201d entails:\nPickup contributions plus any remuneration received as a school employee excluding ... remuneration ... received by a school employee during his school service tvhich is not based on the standard salary schedule under which he is rendering service ... or any other payment ... which may be provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which may be determined ... to be for the purpose of enhancing compensation as a factor in the determination of final average salary.\n24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8102 (emphasis added). Under this definition, remuneration received by an employee that is not based on the standard salary schedule is excluded, as are payments provided to enhance compensation for retirement purposes. The definition is in the disjunctive, such that finding of the latter is not essential, as appellants would have us accept. Appellants admit their salaries with the union were not based on the School District\u2019s standard salary schedule. Thus, it is irrelevant the remuneration would not have been provided by the union for the purpose of enhancing compensation. Accordingly, the union-approved salary, which exceeded the School District standard salary, may appropriately be excluded.\nTherefore, we find \u00a7 8102 of the Code does not authorize increased salaries earned through a collective bargaining organization while on approved leave from a school district to be included as credit for retirement calculation purposes; under the statute, only the salary corresponding with the position held at the school district during the approved leave may be credited to retirement earnings. We further find, the inclusion of the higher salary in appellants\u2019 benefits calculations constituted an artificial inflation of retirement benefits, which is precluded under the Code.\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices SAYLOR, BAER, TODD, McCAFFERY and GREENSPAN join the opinion.\n. Appellants Kirsch and Steinberg were members of Philadelphia Federation of Teachers, Local 3, American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO. Appellants Doyle and Gormley were members of School Employees Local 1201 National Conference of Fireman & Oilers Affiliated with SEIU AFL-CIO.\n. Appellants contend PSERS is estopped from refusing to recognize the higher union salaries because it accepted the contributions based on the higher salaries without dispute or objection. However, 24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8534 obligates the Public School Employees\u2019 Retirement Board to correct any error in records and adjust payments whenever it discovers such an error. The Board learned of the error only upon appellants\u2019 retirement, and it corrected the error at that time.\n. ''Compensation\u201d under the Code includes:\nPickup contributions plus any remuneration received as a school employee excluding reimbursements for expenses incidental to employment and excluding any bonus, severance payments, any other remuneration or other emolument received by a school employee during his school service which is not based on the standard salary schedule under which he is rendering service, payments for unused sick leave or vacation leave, bonuses or other compensation for attending school seminars and conventions, payments under health and welfare plans based on hours of employment or any other payment or emolument which may be provided for in a collective bargaining agreement which may be determined by the Public School Employees\u2019 Retirement Board to be for the purpose of enhancing-compensation as a factor in the determination of final average salapyU\n24 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8102.\n. Appellants also argue the Commonwealth Court erred in determining they were not school employees during their approved leave. The Commonwealth Court found appellants were union employees during their approved leave; therefore, the salary they received through the unions was not received as a school employee and constituted artificial inflation of compensation. See Kirsch, at 670-71. However, as noted above, because the leave salary exceeded the standard salary schedule, the increased salaries constituted artificial inflation of compensation under \u00a7 8102. As our holding lies independent of appellants\u2019 employment status, we need not address whether they were school employees during their leave of absence in order to determine whether the enhanced salaries constituted an artificial inflation of compensation. Accordingly, further inquiry into appellants' argument is unnecessary."}
