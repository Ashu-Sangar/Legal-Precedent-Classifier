{"id": "885539", "contents": "Per Ctjriam,\nThe learned trial judge was clearly right in refusing to withdraw the case from the jury by giving the binding instructions recited in the first specification of error.\nWe find no error in either of the excerpts from the charge recited in the three remaining specifications respectively; nor do we think there is any question in either of them that calls for discussion. The assignments of error are accordingly dismissed, and the judgment affirmed."}
