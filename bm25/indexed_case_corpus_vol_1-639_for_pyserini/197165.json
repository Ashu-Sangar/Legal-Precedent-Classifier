{"id": "197165", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nJustice NIGRO.\nThe question presented in this case is whether incarceration, standing alone, is a \u201cmaterial and substantial change in circumstances\u201d that provides sufficient grounds for modification or termination of a child support order. We hold that it is not.\nAppellant Keith A. Yerkes (\u201cFather\u201d) and Appellee Lydia A. Yerkes (\u201cMother\u201d) were married in November 1978 and separated in August 1992. During their marriage, the parties had two children: Amy, born in January 1988, and Richard, born in August 1988. Immediately following the parties\u2019 separation, Mother sought child support from Father. The parties eventually reached an agreement for support in November 1992, whereby Father was to pay one hundred dollars per week for the support of Amy and Richard. Later the same month, the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County ordered compliance with the agreement and further directed that it be accomplished by payroll deductions from Father\u2019s regular paychecks.\nIn 1994, Father was arrested for sexually assaulting Amy, who was eleven years old at the time. He was ultimately convicted of aggravated indecent assault and has been incarcerated for that crime since August 1994. Father is currently imprisoned at the State Correctional Institute at Huntingdon, Pennsylvania (\u201cSCI-Huntingdon\u201d), and will be released by August 2004.\nIn May 1997, Father petitioned the trial court for modification or termination of the November 1992 support order. The parties were directed to meet at a support conference to take place in August 1997, although Father did not appear because of his incarceration. Following the conference, the conference officer recommended that the petition be dismissed on account of Father\u2019s conviction for assaulting Amy, who was a beneficiary of the support order. The trial court agreed and dismissed Father\u2019s petition later in August 1997.\nIn September 1997, Father filed exceptions and requested a hearing de novo before the trial court, which was held in May 1999. Mother appeared at the hearing in person and Father appeared, pro se, by telephone from SCI-Huntingdon. Father\u2019s sole argument at the hearing was that he was financially unable to pay his child support obligation because of his incarceration. Specifically, he maintained that his wage of forty-one cents per hour at SCI-Huntingdon only yielded a monthly salary of approximately fifty dollars. He claimed that such a salary made it impossible for him to satisfy his child support obligation, which he alleged was based on his former salary of $241.58 per week. Moreover, Father claimed to have no other assets.\nFollowing the hearing, the trial court dismissed Father\u2019s exceptions and ratified the August 1997 order. Father appealed, and the Superior Court affirmed in a memorandum decision. 782 A.2d 1068 (Pa.Super.2001) (table). We granted Father\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal, 567 Pa. 764, 790 A.2d 1018 (2001), and now affirm.\nThe thrust of Father\u2019s argument is that his support obligation should be modified or terminated because he is unable to pay due to his imprisonment and the inadequate wage he earns at SCI-Huntingdon. In making this argument, he alleges that there is a conflict among Superior Court decisions regarding the effect of imprisonment on child support obligations. He also contends that the trial court erred in essentially adopting a per se rule barring modification or termination where the victim of the parent\u2019s criminal acts is also the beneficiary of the support order. Accordingly, he claims that the trial court should have modified or terminated his support obligation. We disagree.\nThe principal goal in child support matters is to serve the best interests of the child through provision of reasonable expenses. Oeler by Gross v. Oeler, 527 Pa. 532, 594 A.2d 649, 651 (1991); Sutliff v. Sutliff, 515 Pa. 393, 528 A.2d 1318, 1322 (1987) (plurality). The duty of child support, \u201cas every other duty encompassed in the role of parenthood, is the equal responsibility of both mother and father.\u201d Conway v. Dana, 456 Pa. 536, 318 A.2d 324, 326 (1974). As this duty is \u201cabsolute,\u201d Larson v. Diveglia, 549 Pa. 118, 700 A.2d 931, 932 (1997), it must be discharged by the parents \u201ceven if it causes them some hardship.\u201d Sutliff, 528 A.2d at 1322; see also 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4321(2) (\u201cParents are liable for the support of their children who are unemancipated and 18 years of age or younger.\u201d (emphasis added)). That said, reality dictates that the parental obligation of support be guided by the parents\u2019 respective capacities and abilities, which depend on the parents\u2019 property, income, and earning capacity. Costello v. LeNoir, 462 Pa. 36, 337 A.2d 866, 868 (1975); Conway, 318 A.2d at 326. These capacities and abilities are to be assessed at the time that child support payments are sought. Costello, 337 A.2d at 868; see also Labar v. Labar, 557 Pa. 54, 731 A.2d 1252, 1253 n. 1 (1999) (citing Costello rule).\nTo give effect to the requirement of reasonable financial support, the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure provide a comprehensive set of guidelines for the appropriate amount of child support to be contributed by each parent. See generally Pa.R.C.P. No.1910.16-1 to 1910.16-7. In each child support matter, the support contribution indicated by the guidelines is entitled to a strong presumption of correctness. See 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4322(b); Pa.R.C.P. No.l910.16-l(d); Ball v. Minnick, 538 Pa. 441, 648 A.2d 1192, 1196 (1994); see also Mascaro v. Mascaro, 569 Pa. 255, 803 A.2d 1186, 1189-91 (2002) (reciting rules containing presumption). Once a support order is in effect, \u201c[a] petition for modification ... may be filed at any time and shall be granted if the requesting party demonstrates a substantial change in circumstances.\u201d 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4352(a); see also Pa.R.C.P. No.1910.19 (stating standard for modification). Accordingly, it is the petitioning parent\u2019s burden to \u201cspecifically aver the material and substantial change in circumstances upon which the petition is based.\u201d Pa.R.C.P. No.l910.19(a); see also Colonna v. Colonna, 788 A.2d 430, 438 (Pa.Super.2001) (en banc) (stating that burden is on moving party), appeal granted, 569 Pa. 678, 800 A.2d 930 (2002). A finding of either a \u201cmaterial and substantial change in circumstances\u201d or no such change is reviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion. Bowser v. Blom, 569 Pa. 609, 807 A.2d 830, 834 (2002); Larson, 700 A.2d at 932. \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs where there is an error in judgment, a manifestly unreasonable decision, or a misapplication of law.\u201d Larson, 700 A.2d at 932; see also Bowser, 807 A.2d at 834 (defining \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard).\nThis Court has never directly addressed whether incarceration, standing alone, is a \u201cmaterial and substantial change in circumstances\u201d that provides sufficient grounds for modification or termination of a child support order. A review of cases from other jurisdictions, however, reveals a wealth of case law that can be loosely categorized into three groups, each of which represents a different approach to assessing the effect of incarceration on support obligations. See In re Marriage of Thurmond, 265 Kan. 715, 962 P.2d 1064, 1068-72 (1998) (identifying approaches and collecting cases); Halliwell v. Halliwell, 326 N.J.Super. 442, 741 A.2d 638, 644-45 (App.Div.1999) (same); see also Frank J. Wozniak, Annotation, Loss of Income Due to Incarceration as Affecting Child Support Obligation, 27 A.L.R. 5th 540 (1995) (collecting and discussing cases). The first approach, dubbed the \u201cno justification\u201d rule, generally deems criminal incarceration as insufficient to justify elimination or reduction of an open obligation to pay child support. See Thurmond, 962 P.2d at 1068-70; Halliwell, 741 A.2d at 644. The second approach, known as the \u201ccomplete justification\u201d rule, generally deems incarceration for criminal conduct as sufficient to justify elimination or reduction of an existing child support obligation. See Thurmond, 962 P.2d at 1070-71; Halliwell, 741 A.2d at 644-45. Finally, the third approach is the \u201cone factor\u201d rule, which generally requires the trial court to simply consider the fact of criminal incarceration along with other factors in determining whether to eliminate or reduce an open obligation to pay child support. See Thurmond, 962 P.2d at 1071-72; Halliwell, 741 A.2d at 645.\nThe fundamental disagreement between those courts applying a \u201cno justification\u201d rule and those adopting one of the other two rules hinges on whether relief should ever be granted to incarcerated parents. It appears that each court\u2019s ultimate conclusion on this issue is driven by three underlying considerations: (1) whether allowing relief to an incarcerated parent serves the best interests of the child, (2) whether relief is in accord with fairness principles, and (3) whether it is appropriate to treat incarceration in the same manner as voluntary unemployment.\nWith regard to the first consideration, i.e., whether relief serves the best interests of the child, courts invoking the \u201cno justification\u201d rule often maintain that it is in the best interests of the child for the support order to remain intact because of the possibility of future reimbursement. E.g., Reid, 944 S.W.2d at 562; see also Nelson, 587 So.2d at 178 (reasoning that obligor\u2019s support obligation can be satisfied after release from prison). Moreover, some courts that have adopted this rule emphasize that a downward modification does not benefit the child whose best interests are at stake, but instead benefits only the obligor. E.g., Richardson, 681 N.E.2d at 508; Baggett, 990 P.2d at 245-46. On the other hand, those jurisdictions that reject the \u201cno justification\u201d rule often counter that such an approach to the best interests principle is unrealistic:\n[Under the \u201cno justification\u201d rule,] the child support judgment will not be paid during the time that the parent is incarcerated, and therefore the judgment will simply accrue with interest. Such a situation provides little or no benefit to anyone. The children do not receive the benefit of the proceeds during the time they require the funds, and the parent is simply confronted with a large, nondischargeable judgment upon release from prison, at a time when the prospect of paying a large judgment with interest is extremely unlikely. At current interest rates the judgment will double every 6 or 7 years. How this can be in the children\u2019s best interest is difficult ... to imagine.\nPierce, 412 N.W.2d at 293 (quoting Ohler v. Ohler, 220 Neb. 272, 369 N.W.2d 615, 618-19 (1985) (Krivosha, C.J., dissenting)); see also Nab, 757 P.2d at 1238 (reasoning that continuation of support obligation of incarcerated parent provides no present benefit to child).\nHaving considered the arguments on both sides of this issue, we conclude that the best interests of the child are better served by the \u201cno justification\u201d rule than by a rule that would allow suspension of the support obligation during an obligor\u2019s incarceration. As the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey has cogently explained:\nWe perceive two possible scenarios. In the first, the obligor is incarcerated and the support obligation is not suspended. Payments go into arrears. Upon release, the obligor cannot pay both current support and arrears, so only the current support is paid. In the second scenario, the obligor is incarcerated and the obligation is suspended during incarceration. Upon release, the obligor resumes paying the pre-incarceration support obligation....\nIn both situations, the child receives no support during the obligor\u2019s incarceration, and in both, the child begins to receive support upon the obligor\u2019s release. The children in these situations are essentially in the same circumstances. The only difference is that the obligor in scenario two has no arrearage debt. Thus, the scenario-one child suffers during the obligor\u2019s incarceration, but there is a possibility of compensation at some point in the future. The scenario-two child also suffers during the obligor\u2019s incarceration, but there is no realistic chance that the substantial arrearage will ever be fully paid.\nThe scenario-one child potentially receives a benefit because (s)he may see some of the arrearage payments; the scenario-one obligor receives no benefit. The scenario-two child receives no benefit, potential or otherwise. Rather, it is the scenario-two obligor who receives the benefit because the arrearage debt has been eliminated. Thus, scenario two works to the benefit of the obligor, while scenario one works to the benefit of the child, at least theoretically. The scenario-two child essentially takes on a burden because the obligor has been relieved temporarily of the parental duty of support.\nThus, the argument that it is not in the best interest of the child to continue the obligation is without merit. The question is not which situation is better for the child; neither situation is beneficial while the obligor is incarcerated. The question is which scenario is worse. Clearly, it is scenario two, in which the child has no real hope of ever seeing the missed support payments to which (s)he is entitled ....\nHalliwell, 741 A.2d at 645-46 (footnote omitted). We agree with the New Jersey court that, although none of the three rules will provide short-term relief to the child, the \u201cno justification\u201d rule at least provides for the possibility that the obligor will repay the support owed to the child. Consequently, as stated above, the \u201cno justification\u201d rule is the approach that is in the best interests of the child. See Oeler, 594 A.2d at 651 (purpose of child support is to promote best interests of child); Sutliff, 528 A.2d at 1322 (same).\nWith regard to the second consideration, i.e., which approach is most \u201cfair,\u201d proponents of the \u201cno justification\u201d rule often reason that fairness principles dictate that an obligor should not benefit from criminal conduct or be allowed to use it as a means to escape child support obligations. E.g., Mooney, 848 P.2d at 1023; Nelson, 587 So.2d at 178. These courts often opine that because the needs of the children have not changed, their needs must prevail over the difficulties of the incarcerated parent. E.g., Reid, 944 S.W.2d at 562. On the other hand, those rejecting the \u201cno justification\u201d rule argue that fairness weighs in favor of the obligor because, without relief, the obligor parent would be saddled with an onerous burden upon release from prison. E.g., Ohler, 369 N.W.2d at 618-19 (Krivosha, C.J., dissenting); Mooney, 848 P.2d at 1024 (Trieweiler, J., dissenting); Nab, 757 P.2d at 1238; Pierce, 412 N.W.2d at 292-93.\nOn balance, we believe that fairness principles also weigh in favor of the \u201cno justification\u201d rule, primarily because affording relief to the incarcerated parent would effectively subordinate child support payments to the parent\u2019s other financial obligations. See Thurmond, 962 P.2d at 1073 (\u201cWhy should an inmate\u2019s child support obligation be subject to modification or suspension by virtue of the parent\u2019s incarceration when ... restitution order[s are] unaffected by incarceration?\u201d); Cavanaugh & Pollack, supra note 6, at 550 (\u2018When people are incarcerated, they are not relieved of their other financial responsibilities, such as making car payments. A child should be afforded at least the same legal status.\u201d (footnote omitted)). In Pennsylvania, child support obligations are considered to be of such importance that parties must give them priority over other expenses. See, e.g., Pa.R.C.P. No.l910.16-l(a) (\u201cThe support of a spouse or child is a priority obligation so that a party is expected to meet this obligation by adjusting his or her other expenses.\u201d); Pa.R.C.P. No.1910.16-1 (Explanatory Comment\u20141998) (\u201cThe guidelines make financial support of a child a primary obligation.\u201d); Pa.R.C.P. No.l910.21(g) (\u201cIf there are multiple support obligations ... the court shall allocate among the obligees the amount of income available for withholding, giving priority to current child support____\u201d). As such, we simply cannot justify relieving incarcerated parents of their child support obligations when they are not relieved of their other financial obligations. Accordingly, we are compelled to agree with those courts adopting the \u201cno justification\u201d rule that fairness counsels in favor of the continuation of support.\nFinally, with regard to the third consideration, ie., whether it is appropriate to analogize incarceration to voluntary unemployment, courts following the \u201cno justification\u201d rule often liken obligors who are sent to prison for criminal conduct to those who voluntarily assume lower paying jobs or leave their jobs. E.g., Mooney, 848 P.2d at 1023; Marshall, 15 S.W.3d at 401. As the Supreme Court of Montana stated:\nCriminal conduct of any nature cannot excuse the obligation to pay support. We see no reason to offer criminals a reprieve from their child support obligations when we would not do the same for an obligor who voluntarily walks away from his job. Unlike the obligor who is unemployed or faced with a reduction in pay through no fault of his own, the incarcerated person has control over his actions and should be held to the consequences.... [An obligor] should not be able to escape his financial obligation to his children simply because his misdeeds have placed him behind bars. The meter should continue to run.\nMooney, 848 P.2d at 1023 (citation omitted); see also Richardson, 681 N.E.2d at 508 (reasoning that imprisonment is a foreseeable result of criminal activity). On the other hand, the Supreme Court of Alaska has rejected the analogy to voluntary unemployment:\nAlthough incarceration is often a foreseeable consequence of criminal misconduct and all criminal acts are in some sense voluntary, non-custodial parents who engage in criminal misconduct seldom desire the enforced unemployment that accompanies incarceration; nor can they alter their situation; and, in stark contrast to parents who consciously choose to remain unemployed, jailed parents rarely have any actual job prospects or potential income. Equating incarceration to voluntary unemployment would require us to ignore these significant, real-life distinctions.\nBendixen, 962 P.2d at 173; see also Franzen, 521 N.W.2d at 629 (reasoning that incarceration is usually an involuntary condition).\nUpon consideration of these competing arguments, we agree with the courts favoring the \u201cno justification\u201d rule that it is appropriate to analogize incarceration to voluntary unemployment. As the Supreme Court of Kansas explained:\nThe specific language utilized in some of the cases supporting [the \u201cno justification\u201d] rule to the effect that incarceration is similar to quitting a job to avoid paying child support and that in both situations, the inability to pay is \u201cvoluntary\u201d stretches reality a bit. Most inmates would have difficulty accepting the concept that their incarceration is to be considered \u201cvoluntary.\u201d It is more accurate to say that a reduction of income from a cause beyond the obligor\u2019s control (such as illness, injury, lay-off, etc.) should be considered differently from those which arise from causes within his or her control. Criminal activity foreseeably can lead to incarceration and such activity is obviously within an individual\u2019s control. Public policy considerations heavily favor the no-justification rule.\nThurmond, 962 P.2d at 1073. We agree with the Supreme Court of Kansas that, as it is foreseeable that criminal conduct can lead to incarceration, a reduction in income occasioned by criminal incarceration is clearly within the control of the obligor. Thus, we conclude that an incarcerated obligor, though in somewhat different circumstances from a voluntarily unemployed obligor, has control over his or her circumstances similar to that of a voluntarily unemployed obligor. Accordingly, it is appropriate to treat these two types of obligors alike. Accord Halliwell, 741 A.2d at 647; Baggett, 990 P.2d at 245; see also 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4322(a) (\u201cChild and spousal support shall be awarded pursuant to a statewide guideline ... so that persons similarly situated shall be treated similarly.\u201d).\nIn sum, we conclude that the \u201cno justification\u201d rule best serves the interests of the child and is in harmony with fairness principles and the child support laws of Pennsylvania. Under the \u201cno justification\u201d rule, it is clear that incarceration, standing alone, is not a \u201cmaterial and substantial change in circumstances\u201d providing sufficient grounds for modification or termination of a child support order. In this case, Father was incarcerated for sexually assaulting his daughter. His sole argument in support of his petition for modification or termination of his child support obligation was that his incarceration made him unable to pay. Thus, Father cannot obtain relief from his child support obligations. Accordingly, the Superior Court did not err in affirming the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Appellant Keith A. Yerkes\u2019 petition for modification or termination of his child support obligation.\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a concurring opinion.\n. In December 1997, while Father\u2019s hearing request was pending, the Domestic Relations Section of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County petitioned for a contempt adjudication against Father for his failure to pay child support, claiming that Father was $17,085.00 in arrears as of that time. The record reveals that a contempt hearing was scheduled for January 1998, but reveals no further details regarding the contempt proceedings. By June 2000, Father\u2019s arrears had reached $28,798.29.\n. According to the trial court, Father\u2019s gross prison wages were $68.88 in May 1997 and $52.28 in June 1997.\n.

The factors taken into account include the reason the obligated parent entered prison, the length of incarceration, the financial circumstances, the potential for work release, the amount of the existing child support award, and the total amount of child support that will have accumulated upon the incarcerated parent\u2019s discharge. See Burbridge, 250 Ill.Dec. 510, 738 N.E.2d at 982; Hamilton, 857 P.2d at 544; Oberg, 869 S.W.2d at 238.\n. The following commentary further supports the analysis of the New Jersey court, though in more practical terms:\nA prison sentence is often referred to as payment for a debt to society. However, a prisoner\u2019s debt is hardly being paid if the prisoner is simultaneously incurring another debt to society by failing to pay child support obligations. Therefore, if the parent is unable to pay child support during incarceration, this \"second\u201d debt can and should be repaid upon release. This is not an additional punishment or fine, but is a simple reimbursement to the state for what the parent was obligated to pay in the first place. Likewise, public policy considerations require that other family members or private individuals who paid the child support owed by the obligor during the obligor\u2019s incarceration, should be reimbursed for their expenditures. Private individuals should not be forced to assume the responsibility and obligations of the incarcerated parent any more than the state should.\nKaren Rothschild Cavanaugh & Daniel Pollack, Child Support Obligations of Incarcerated Parents, 7 Cornell J.L. & Pub. Pol'y 531, 551 (1998) (footnote omitted).\n. Alternatively, some courts invoking a fairness rationale have reasoned that the equitable doctrine of \"unclean hands\" operates to foreclose relief to incarcerated parents. E.g., Reid, 944 S.W.2d at 562; Bairows, 570 A.2d at 1184.\n. The requirement of priority reflected in these rules accords with Pennsylvania\u2019s strong policy favoring payment of child support. See Larson, 700 A.2d at 932; Sutliff, 528 A.2d at 1322; 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4321(2); accord Koch, 456 N.W.2d at 302; Mooney, 848 P.2d at 1023.\n. In addition, the argument that the \"no justification rule\" unfairly burdens incarcerated parents upon their release from prison is undermined by the fact that, in Pennsylvania, the General Assembly has enacted a statute under which incarcerated obligors are prevented from being placed in an impossible position upon release on account of significant arrearages. See 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4348(g) (limiting attachment of child support obligations and arrears to percentage set forth in federal Consumer Credit Protection Act). Moreover, we note that significant arrearages will not ordinarily result in a contempt adjudication, as any failure to pay support upon the parent\u2019s release will likely be justifiable given his or her inability to comply with the support order at that time. See 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4345 (requiring willful failure to comply with support order for contempt adjudication); Pa.RX.P. No.1910.25-1(b) (requiring finding of willfulness and a present ability to comply prior to contempt adjudication for failure to pay child support). We also note that the continuation of the support obligation required by the \"no justification rule\u201d does not burden the parent during incarceration, as the Commonwealth provides the basic needs of any obligor who is incarcerated. See Koch, 456 N.W.2d at 301-02.\n. In Pennsylvania, \"[wjhere a party voluntarily assumes a lower paying job, there generally will be no effect on the support obligation,\u201d and \u201c[a] party will ordinarily not be relieved of a support obligation by voluntarily quitting work or by being fired for cause.\u201d Pa.R.C.P. No.l910.16-2(d)(l). In construing this rule, the Superior Court has required that a party seeking modification after a voluntary reduction in income show (1) that the change was not made for the purpose of avoiding child support, and (2) that reduction is warranted based on the party\u2019s efforts to mitigate the lost income. See Grimes v. Grimes, 408 Pa.Super. 158, 596 A.2d 240, 242 (1991); see also Kersey v. Jefferson, 791 A.2d 419, 423 (Pa.Super.2002). \u201cOtherwise, for calculation of a support obligation, the petitioner will be considered to have an income equal to his or her earning capacity as defined in the support guidelines.\u201d Grimes, 596 A.2d at 242.\n. In addition to being in accord with Pennsylvania law, the \"bright-line\u201d nature of the \u201cno justification\u201d rule is also advantageous because it prevents the burdensome case-by-case determinations that occur under the \"one factor\u201d rule. See Thurmond, 962 P.2d at 1072-73. The \u201cno justification\u201d rule will also result in the filing of fewer modification petitions than necessarily occurs under the \u201ccomplete justification\u201d rule. See id.\n. In Leasure v. Leasure, 378 Pa.Super. 613, 549 A.2d 225 (1988), the Superior Court held that a child support obligation should be suspended where the obligor is incarcerated. To the extent that Leasure conflicts with the approach we adopt today, we disapprove of it.\n. We note that the result dictated by the rule we adopt today is particularly appropriate given these circumstances. See Reid, 944 S.W.2d at 562 (holding that relief is prohibited where \u2018\u2018[t]he misconduct which resulted in appellant\u2019s imprisonment was perpetrated against a child for whom appellant owed a duty of support____\u201d); see also Lewis Becker, Spousal and Child Support and the \u201cVoluntary Reduction of Income\u201d Doctrine, 29 Conn.L.Rev. 647, 718-19 (1997) (\"consideration of the nature of the crime seems appropriate where the crime involves a personal assault on the party adversely affected by a voluntary reduction of income\u201d)."}
