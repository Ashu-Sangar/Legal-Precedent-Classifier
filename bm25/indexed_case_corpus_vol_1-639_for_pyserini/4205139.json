{"id": "4205139", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice BAER.\nIn this capital case, Ronald Hanible (\u201cAppellant\u201d) appeals from the Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County (\u201cPCRA court\u201d), which denied without a hearing all guilt phase claims raised in his petition filed pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\nThe facts underlying Appellant\u2019s two murder convictions are fully set forth in our opinion affirming his judgment of sentence on direct appeal. Commonwealth v. Hanible, 575 Pa. 255, 836 A.2d 36 (2003). We reiterate those facts necessary to facilitate an understanding of the issues raised herein.\nThe record establishes that in the late afternoon on January 15, 1999, while wearing a black ski hat and black sunglasses, Appellant visited the home of his aunt, Catherine McCants. McCants\u2019 daughter-in-law, Andrea Wilson, was also in the home at the time. Fifteen minutes after his arrival, at approximately 4:45 p.m., Appellant left the home and encountered Eric Wiley, McCants\u2019 godson, on the street outside of McCants\u2019 home. Appellant suggested to Wiley that the two men rob Milton Wise and Rodney Walters because they routinely \u201cran numbers\u201d on that particular street and would have cash. Notes of Testimony (\u201cN.T.\u201d) 3/5/2001 at 106. This was the second time Appellant discussed with Wiley a plan to rob the two victims. Wiley refused to participate in the robbery on the same block where his godmother resided, and noted his concern that one of the potential victims may be connected to the mob. Appellant responded, \u201cI\u2019ll do it without you.\u201d Id. at 111.\nWiley then left Appellant on the street, and proceeded to McCants\u2019 residence. As Wiley did so, he observed Appellant standing in front of a vacant lot, and thought he saw Wise and Walters standing on the opposite side of the street. When Wiley entered McCants\u2019 home, he was sweating and flustered, and McCants inquired about what was going on. Wiley responded that he had just seen Appellant, who told him that McCants wanted to see Wiley. After their brief visit, Wiley was about to open McCants\u2019 front door to leave when he heard two gunshots. Wiley opened McCants\u2019 door and saw Wise lying on the ground with Appellant standing over him, pointing a gun. He then observed Walters run to Wise\u2019s aid. Moments later, Wiley heard two more gunshots. As Walters ran to help Wise, Appellant fired two shots at close range into Walters\u2019 abdomen. Both Wise and Walters died as a result of the shootings. The police arrived and obtained from the crime scene two black ski hats, and a pair of black sunglasses. McCants identified one of the hats and the sunglasses as being the same items worn by Appellant earlier that afternoon, and identified the other black hat as belonging to Wise, the victim. N.T. 3/2/2001 at 11. On January 19, 1999, four days after the murder, police obtained a signed statement from Wiley describing the events as set forth above. A few days later, Appellant was arrested and charged with the murders of Wise and Walters. The police recovered $1,169 on Appellant\u2019s person at the time of his arrest.\nAt trial, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of Wiley. However, while on the witness stand, Wiley repudiated the statement he previously gave police, and testified that he never had a conversation with Appellant about a potential robbery of the victims, did not observe Appellant standing over Wise with a gun, and knew nothing about the murders. Wiley explained that police forced him to make and sign the false statement by physically attacking him and threatening to charge him \"with the murders. The Commonwealth then effectively impeached its own witness by confronting Wiley with the relevant portions of the statement he gave to police. To bolster the veracity of Wiley\u2019s prior statement, the Commonwealth also presented the testimony of the officer who took Wiley\u2019s statement, Detective Patrick Mangold. Detective Mangold testified that he did not use physical force or threat to obtain information from Wiley, and did not suggest answers to the questions posed, but rather asked Wiley questions and wrote down his responses verbatim. The Commonwealth further presented the testimony of McCants and her daughter-in-law, Andrea Wilson, which established that Appellant was at McCants\u2019 residence moments before the shootings that occurred in front of her home. McCants also testified that Appellant was wearing the same black sunglasses and ski hat that were recovered by police at the murder scene.\nA medical examiner testified that Walters sustained two gunshot wounds to his lower abdomen, and that the gun was held against the victim\u2019s clothing when the shots were fired. He explained that the bullets pierced the victim\u2019s bowel, iliac artery, and kidney, with one bullet exiting the body and the other lodging in the victim\u2019s right hip. The medical examiner also testified that Wise suffered a single gunshot wound to the chest. The bullet travelled through his lung and heart, and lodged in his spine. A firearms examiner testified that the bullets recovered were .38 or .357 caliber and had most likely been fired from a revolver.\nAppellant did not testify on his own behalf or present any witnesses at trial. Instead, he urged the jury to reject Wiley\u2019s statement to police as unreliable because, as Wiley testified, the statement was given out of fear that Wiley would be charged with the murders if he failed to implicate Appellant. He further contended that Wiley\u2019s statement to police was not worthy of belief because a crime scene photo demonstrated that Wiley\u2019s view of the shooting through McCants\u2019 doorway was obstructed by a van parked in front of her home. Thus, Appellant asserted, Wiley could not have seen what he described in his police statement.\nFinally, Appellant argued to the jury that none of the physical evidence recovered by police implicated him in the crime. First, he argued there was no DNA evidence connecting him to either of the hats found at the scene. Second, Appellant maintained that McCants\u2019 testimony, which linked him to the hat and sunglasses recovered at the scene, was not credible because McCants may have been trying to \u201ccover up\u201d Wiley\u2019s participation in the murders by incriminating Appellant. Third, Appellant argued that the substantial amount of cash found on him when arrested did not implicate him in the crime because the parties stipulated that the victims possessed large sums of money after the murders and robbery occurred.\nOn March 9, 2001, a jury found Appellant guilty of first degree murder for the killing of Wise, second degree murder for the killing of Walters, two counts of robbery, and possession of an instrument of crime. Following the penalty hearing, the jury found two aggravating circumstances, namely that Appellant committed the murder while in the perpetration of a robbery, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6), and that Appellant had been convicted of another murder, id. at \u00a7 9711(d)(ll), and no mitigating circumstances. Accordingly, it returned a verdict of death.\nThe trial court formally imposed the death sentence on June 13, 2001. Appellant obtained new counsel who thereafter filed a direct appeal raising three issues: (1) whether the evidence, which consisted primarily of a statement that had been repudiated, was sufficient to support the murder convictions; (2) whether the verdict was against the weight of the evidence for this same reason; and (3) whether a new penalty hearing was warranted because the trial court failed to instruct the jury on the mitigating circumstance that Appellant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions. Our Court rejected Appellant\u2019s claims, and affirmed Appellant\u2019s conviction and sentence. Commonwealth v. Hanible, 575 Pa. 255, 836 A.2d 36 (2003). On October 4, 2004, the United States Supreme Court denied Appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. Hanible v. Pennsylvania, 543 U.S. 835, 125 S.Ct. 248, 160 L.Ed.2d 55 (2004).\nOn November 19, 2004, Appellant filed a pro se PCRA petition, and counsel was appointed. The Defender Association of Philadelphia, Federal Court Division, Habeas Corpus Unit, subsequently entered its appearance, and filed an amended PCRA petition and two supplements to that petition, along with a motion for discovery. The Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss the PCRA petition, but subsequently agreed that a new penalty hearing was warranted due to trial counsel\u2019s failure to present available mitigating evidence. The Commonwealth thereafter filed a revised motion to dismiss Appellant\u2019s guilt phase claims, in which it opposed discovery and an evidentiary hearing. In response, Appellant filed a letter-brief answer on April 4, 2008, as well as a supplemental appendix.\nOn July 2, 2008, former Justice Jane Cutler Greenspan, acting as the PCRA court judge, granted a new penalty hearing based on the parties\u2019 agreement, and issued a 35-page opinion and notice of intent to dismiss all guilt phase claims without a hearing pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 909. On July 22, 2008, Appellant filed a response to the notice to dismiss in which he raised no new issues, but supplemented his argument relating to the issues previously presented. Because former Justice Greenspan was elevated to this Court before an order was entered dismissing Appellant\u2019s PCRA petition, the matter was reassigned to the Honorable Jeffrey Minehart, who, on March 4, 2009, issued an order granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss Appellant\u2019s PCRA petition without a hearing, denying Appellant\u2019s motion for further discovery, and incorporating former Justice Greenspan\u2019s Opinion dismissing all guilt phase claims.\nAppellant now raises sixteen issues for review, each of which has several sub-issues. Our review of a PCRA court\u2019s decision is limited to examining whether the PCRA court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by the record, and whether its conclusions of law are free from legal error. Commonwealth v. Colavita, 606 Pa. 1, 993 A.2d 874, 886 (2010). The scope of review is limited to the findings of the PCRA court and the evidence of record, viewed in the light most favorable to the prevailing party at the trial level. Id.\nUnder Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 909, which governs PCRA petitions in capital cases, the PCRA court has the discretion to dismiss a petition without a hearing when the court is satisfied \u201cthat there are no genuine issues concerning any material fact, the defendant is not entitled to post-conviction collateral relief, and no legitimate purpose would be served by any further proceedings.\u201d Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(B)(2). \u201c[T]o obtain reversal of a PCRA court\u2019s decision to dismiss a petition without a hearing, an appellant must show that he raised a genuine issue of fact which, if resolved in his favor, would have entitled him to relief, or that the court otherwise abused its discretion in denying a hearing.\u201d Commonwealth v. D\u2019Amato, 579 Pa. 490, 856 A.2d 806, 820 (2004).\nIn order to be eligible for PCRA relief, Appellant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the enumerated circumstances found at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2) (setting forth the eligibility requirements of the PCRA). Further, Appellant must demonstrate that the issues raised in his PCRA petition have not been previously litigated or waived. Id. \u00a7 9543(a)(3). An issue has been previously litigated if \u201cthe highest appellate court in which the petitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9544(a)(2). A PCRA claim is waived \u201cif the petitioner could have raised it but failed to do so before trial, at trial, during unitary review, on appeal or in a prior state post[-]conviction proceeding.\u201d Id. \u00a7 9544(b).\nThe majority of Appellant\u2019s claims challenge the performance of counsel. It is well-established that counsel is presumed effective, and the defendant bears the burden of proving ineffectiveness. Commonwealth v. Cooper, 596 Pa. 119, 941 A.2d 655, 664 (2007). To overcome this presumption, Appellant must demonstrate that: (1) the underlying substantive claim has arguable merit; (2) counsel whose effectiveness is being challenged did not have a reasonable basis for his or her actions or failure to act; and (3) the defendant suffered prejudice as a result of counsel\u2019s deficient performance. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 567 Pa. 186, 786 A.2d 203, 213 (2001). A claim of ineffectiveness will be denied if the defendant\u2019s evidence fails to meet any one of these prongs. Id. at 221-22.\nWith regard to the reasonable basis prong, \u201cwe do not question whether there were other more logical courses of action which counsel could have pursued; rather, we must examine whether counsel\u2019s decisions had any reasonable basis.\u201d Commonwealth v. Washington, 592 Pa. 698, 927 A.2d 586, 594 (2007). We will conclude that counsel\u2019s chosen strategy lacked a reasonable basis only if Appellant proves that \u201can alternative not chosen offered a potential for success substantially greater than the course actually pursued.\u201d Commonwealth v. Williams, 587 Pa. 304, 899 A.2d 1060, 1064 (2006) (citation omitted). To establish the prejudice prong, the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different but for counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Commonwealth v. Dennis, 597 Pa. 159, 950 A.2d 945, 954 (2008).\nIn Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726 (2002), which was decided before Appellant\u2019s direct appeal was filed, this Court abrogated the rule that ineffectiveness claims based on trial counsel\u2019s performance must be raised at the first opportunity where a defendant has new counsel, see Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687, 695 n. 6 (1977), and held that a defendant \u201cshould wait to raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel until collateral review.\u201d Grant, 813 A.2d at 738. Thus, Appellant\u2019s first opportunity to challenge trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness was in his PCRA petition, and he need not address appellate counsel\u2019s performance in order to preserve the underlying claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness.\nPrior to addressing the merits of Appellant\u2019s claims, we note that the majority of the issues presented entail multiple sub-issues, many of which are entirely unrelated to each other; while other issues overlap in substantial part. Appellant also offers substantial analysis establishing the arguable merit of separate sub-issues of a single issue, yet sets forth a combined analysis of the reasonable basis and prejudice prongs of the ineffective assistance of counsel standard. In an effort to afford full review to all claims raised, we will set forth Appellant\u2019s argument on each issue, and dispose of each contention in an order that facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the claims raised.\nI. Counsel Ineffectiveness for Failing to Challenge Appellant\u2019s Conviction on Due Process and Sixth Amendment Grounds\nAppellant first contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge his conviction, via a motion for judgment of acquittal, on two separate grounds: due process and the Sixth Amendment.\nA. Due Process\nAppellant submits there is arguable merit to the underlying claim that his first degree murder conviction violates due process because it was based upon the least reliable form of evidence \u2014 the statement Wiley gave to police and repudiated at trial. He explains that his conviction violates due process because Wiley\u2019s statement is uncorroborated by any other witness, and is inherently unreliable. Appellant characterizes the jury\u2019s verdict as being based upon nothing more than hearsay accusations made by Wiley, who had every reason to accuse Appellant falsely to avoid his own prosecution for the offense. He emphasizes that Wiley was the only individual to identify him as the shooter, and provided the only evidence of a planned robbery. Appellant further asserts there was no DNA evidence linking him to the crime, no gun recovered from the scene, and no \u201creliable\u201d evidence linking him to the physical evidence found at the murder scene. Under these circumstances, Appellant posits, trial counsel should have filed a motion for judgment of acquittal before the case went to the jury, contending that a conviction based on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence would violate due process.\nConcerning the second prong of the ineffectiveness test, Appellant contends that trial counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to seek relief in the trial court based on a due process violation, particularly where counsel\u2019s argument to the jury focused on the unreliability of the evidence, and the untrustworthiness of Wiley\u2019s statement to police. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 15. As to the prejudice prong of the ineffectiveness test, Appellant states, without elaboration, that \u201c[h]ad counsel made a timely motion to the court, there is a reasonable likelihood that it would have been granted and the charges against Appellant resolved in his favor. The prejudice could not be more extreme.\u201d Id. at 15-16.\nIn resolving this issue, the PCRA court concluded that this claim was previously litigated because Appellant challenged the sufficiency of the evidence on direct appeal, arguing that Wiley\u2019s recanted statement was insufficient to support his murder convictions. Appellant contends that the PCRA court erred in finding this claim previously litigated because his current claim of constitutional error raised in his PCRA petition is distinct from the challenges to the sufficiency and weight of the evidence raised on direct appeal.\nIn response, the Commonwealth asserts that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to challenge Appellant\u2019s conviction on the ground that it would violate due process. Initially, it maintains that the PCRA court properly found the issue to be unreviewable as previously litigated because our Court on direct appeal specifically rejected challenges to the sufficiency and weight of the evidence, which were based on the alleged unreliability of Wiley\u2019s recanted statement to police. The Commonwealth argues that although Appellant\u2019s current claim is couched in terms of due process, the claim is essentially the same as that raised on direct appeal.\nAs to the merits of the ineffectiveness claim, the Commonwealth submits that Appellant has failed to satisfy his burden of demonstrating the ineffectiveness of counsel. It emphasizes that to overcome the presumption that counsel was effective, a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s conduct was deficient or \u201coutside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,\u201d and that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Appellant failed to do so here, the Commonwealth maintains, because trial counsel made all the arguments to the jury which Appellant faults him for failing to raise, i.e., that the jury should discredit Wiley\u2019s statement because he may have been involved in the crime; that Wiley never adopted his statement to police, and instead asserted that the police forced him to make the statement; that Wiley\u2019s view of the shooting through McCants\u2019 door was obstructed by a van parked in front of McCants\u2019 house; that the presence of money in the victims\u2019 pockets casts doubt on Wiley\u2019s statement that Appellant planned to rob the victims; and that there was no DNA evidence confirming that the hat and sunglasses found at the scene belonged to Appellant. According to the Commonwealth, trial counsel\u2019s presentation of these arguments to the jury, instead of presenting them to the court via a motion for judgment of acquittal based on a violation of due process, was reasonable. Moreover, the Commonwealth submits, Appellant has failed to demonstrate prejudice because there was no chance that the trial court would have granted the motion for judgment of acquittal. See Commonwealth v. Laird, 555 Pa. 629, 726 A.2d 346, 355 (1999) (counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for declining to present a merit-less claim).\nWe begin by recognizing that the PCRA court erroneously found this claim to be previously litigated pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(a)(2) (providing that an issue has been previously litigated if \u201cthe highest court in which the petitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue.\u201d). We agree with Appellant that this Court on direct appeal did not rule on the merits of the issue raised herein, which challenges counsel\u2019s performance. See Commonwealth v. Collins, 585 Pa. 45, 888 A.2d 564, 573 (2005) (holding that a Sixth Amendment claim alleging ineffective assistance of counsel raises an issue cognizable under the PCRA even if the claim underlying the ineffectiveness claim has been previously litigated). Moreover, the underlying issues raised on direct appeal are distinct from those raised in Appellant\u2019s PCRA petition because the former issues challenged the sufficiency and weight of the evidence, while the later allege a due process violation. The fact that all claims are premised upon a purported lack of reliability of the evidence supporting the first degree murder conviction does not render the instant claim unreviewable as previously litigated.\nWe therefore proceed to address the ineffectiveness issue. Even assuming, for purposes of discussion, that there is arguable merit to the claim, Appellant has failed to demonstrate the remaining two prongs of the ineffectiveness test. As to the reasonable basis prong, we recognize that, generally, the court should not glean from the record whether counsel had a reasonable basis for his action or inaction absent an evidentiary hearing, and that it is only in the most clear-cut cases that the reasons for counsel\u2019s conduct are apparent from the record. Commonwealth v. McGill, 574 Pa. 574, 832 A.2d 1014, 1022 (2003). That being said, a PCRA petitioner must set forth a basis upon which to find trial counsel\u2019s performance constitutionally deficient. Appellant fails to offer any persuasive authority establishing that trial counsel acted unreasonably in emphasizing the unreliability of the evidence in his arguments to the jury and in his challenges to the weight and sufficiency of the evidence on appeal, rather than couching his claim in terms of due process in a motion for judgment of acquittal. In fact, he offers no Pennsylvania case in which similar relief has been granted on due process grounds, and upon which trial counsel purportedly should have relied in making a due process challenge. The record supports the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion that trial counsel made all the underlying arguments relating to the unreliability of the evidence to the jury and on direct appeal, which Appellant now faults him for failing to raise. Counsel\u2019s failure to pose them as a challenge to due process does not render his performance constitutionally deficient, absent some authority existing at the time of trial that would have prompted trial counsel to pursue the issue sounding in due process. Because the strategy actually pursued by trial counsel was reasonably designed to effectuate Appellant\u2019s interests, he has failed to demonstrate a lack of reasonable basis. See Washington, 927 A.2d at 594 (providing that \u201cwe do not question whether there were other more logical courses of action which counsel could have pursued; rather, we must examine whether counsel\u2019s decisions had any reasonable basis.\u201d).\nMoreover, Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim also fails for lack of prejudice because Appellant has not demonstrated that there is a reasonable probability that the trial court would have granted a motion for judgment on acquittal on due process grounds or that counsel would have been successful had he raised such issue on direct appeal. See Commonwealth v. Sneed, 587 Pa. 318, 899 A.2d 1067, 1084 (2006) (holding that to demonstrate prejudice, the petitioner must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s error or omission, the result of the proceeding would have been different). As noted by the Commonwealth, the trial court considered all of Appellant\u2019s contentions regarding the purported unreliability of the evidence presented against him, albeit under the independent rubric of challenges to the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. The trial court rejected these contentions, and this Court affirmed those rulings on direct appeal. Significantly, in doing so, both the trial court, as well as this Court, expressly rejected the essential premise of Appellant\u2019s current due process claim, i.e., that the evidence supporting his first degree murder conviction was unreliable and insufficient as a matter of law. As we noted on direct appeal, Appellant\u2019s conviction was not based solely on Wiley\u2019s recanted statement. Rather, the testimony of McCants and her daughter-in-law placed Appellant at the scene moments before the shooting, and items found at the scene were identified as belonging to Appellant. As Appellant has failed to demonstrate that that there is a reasonable probability that a challenge to his conviction based on due process would have been successful, he has failed to establish the requisite prejudice necessary to support his claim of ineffectiveness.\nB. Sixth Amendment\nAppellant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to file a motion for judgment of acquittal on grounds that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation because Wiley\u2019s accusations could not be adequately tested through cross-examination. He submits that there is arguable merit to the claim because, at trial, Wiley refused to adopt the accusations as his own, and indicated that he made the statement only because he had been beaten and threatened by police. Thus, Appellant concludes that he was denied the right of confrontation because meaningful cross-examination of Wiley regarding the critical accusatory details of his statement was impossible.\nIn support of his contention, Appellant relies on Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965). In Douglas, after being found guilty in a separate trial, an accomplice of the accused invoked the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination when the accomplice was called to testify at the accused\u2019s trial. Thereafter, the prosecutor read to the jury the accomplice\u2019s written confession, which included information implicating the accused. The High Court in Douglas ruled that the accused\u2019s inability to cross-examine the accomplice about the purported confession denied him the right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.\nAppellant submits that the same result is warranted here, and trial counsel should have pursued such theory in a motion for judgment of acquittal before the case reached the jury. Appellant makes no individualized proffer as to the reasonable basis and prejudice prongs of the ineffectiveness standard, other than that set forth in relation to the due process component of the claim discussed in Issue 1(A). Further, the PCRA court did not independently evaluate this Sixth Amendment claim, but rather found the combined claim of due process/Sixth Amendment to have been previously litigated as set forth above.\nThe Commonwealth responds that Appellant\u2019s claim lacks arguable merit under the Sixth Amendment because the High Court\u2019s ruling in Douglas does not apply to a prior inconsistent statement of a testifying witness. It emphasizes that unlike the declarant in Douglas, Wiley actually testified at Appellant\u2019s trial, and therefore was subject to cross-examination by trial counsel. \u201cIt is the presence of the witness in the courtroom, subject to cross-examination, that enables a jury (unlike an appellate court) to determine whether or not to credit a prior inconsistent statement.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 24. Under such circumstances, the Commonwealth maintains, there can be no Sixth Amendment violation to support the claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness.\nWe agree with the Commonwealth that there is no arguable merit to Appellant\u2019s underlying claim that his Sixth Amendment confrontation rights were violated. It is well-settled that admitting a declarant\u2019s prior inconsistent statement does not violate the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment when the declarant, himself, testifies as a witness at trial and is subject to cross-examination. See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 60, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) (holding that \u201cwhen the declarant appears for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause places no constraints at all on the use of his prior testimonial statements\u201d); California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 162, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970) (holding that where the declarant is not absent, but is present to testify and to submit to cross-examination, the admission of his out-of-court statements does not create a confrontation problem). Trial counsel had every opportunity to cross-examine Wiley at trial, and, in fact, did so, eliciting details regarding why he gave the \u201cfalse\u201d statement implicating Appellant to police. See N.T. 3/5/2001 at 64-82. Accordingly, there is no legal basis to support Appellant\u2019s suggestion that trial counsel should have filed a motion for judgment of acquittal based upon a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, and counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for faffing to raise a baseless claim.\nII. Counsel Ineffectiveness for Failing to Object to Wiley\u2019s Statement\nAppellant next argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the admission of Wiley\u2019s prior statement to police as substantive evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt, and for failing to seek a jury instruction in this regard., He argues that Wiley\u2019s statement to police is inherently unreliable, and fails to satisfy the requisites for admission of prior inconsistent statements set forth in Commonwealth v. Lively, 530 Pa. 464, 610 A.2d 7 (1992), and Pa.R.E. 803.1(1). In Lively, this Court held that the admission of a prior inconsistent statement of a non-party witness shall be used as substantive evidence only when: (1) the statement was given under oath at a formal legal proceeding; or (2) the statement is reduced to a writing signed and adopted by the declarant; or (3) the statement is recorded verbatim contemporaneously with the making of the statement. Id. at 10.\nAppellant challenges the lower court\u2019s finding that Wiley\u2019s statement was \u201csigned and adopted by the declarant.\u201d The crux of his claim is that Wiley never \u201cadopted\u201d his statement at trial, but rather repudiated it, raising a question as to whether the statement was ever made. Further, Appellant submits, Wiley\u2019s statement to police is not trustworthy for the myriad of reasons he asserted in Issue 1(A), particularly that Wiley was motivated to accuse Appellant falsely because the police threatened Wiley with prosecution for the instant murders. Accordingly, Appellant asserts there is arguable merit to the underlying claim that Wiley\u2019s statement is inadmissible as substantive evidence. He maintains that trial counsel should have objected to the admission of such statement, and requested an appropriate limiting instruction, informing the jury that it could consider Wiley\u2019s prior inconsistent statement to police only to impeach Wiley\u2019s trial testimony that he had no intimate knowledge of the murders, and not as substantive evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt.\nRegarding the second prong of the ineffectiveness test, Appellant asserts that Wiley\u2019s statement was the most important evidence in the Commonwealth\u2019s case, and trial counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to at least seek an instruction cautioning the jury against considering Wiley\u2019s prior statement for the truth of its contents. Finally, he submits that he satisfied the prejudice prong of the ineffectiveness test because, had trial counsel made the proper objection and sought the appropriate jury charge, there is a reasonable likelihood that the requested relief would have been granted and the jury would have been prohibited from considering Wiley\u2019s statement to police as substantive evidence of his guilt. Appellant maintains that the outcome of the trial would have been different because the jury had no other reliable evidence upon which to base a conviction of first degree murder.\nThe Commonwealth counters that there is no arguable merit to Appellant\u2019s claim that trial counsel provided constitutionally deficient representation when he failed to object to Wiley\u2019s statement on the ground that Wiley did not \u201cadopt\u201d such statement at trial. According to the Commonwealth, the statement was plainly admissible under Lively because the requirement that a statement be \u201csigned and adopted\u201d does not mean that the statement must be adopted at trial. Rather, the Commonwealth asserts, a prior inconsistent statement is admissible as substantive evidence if there is a contemporaneous acknowledgement that the written statement accurately reflects what the -witness said. It maintains that \u201cWiley adopted his statement when he signed it \u2014 his signature served as an attestation that the statement accurately recounted his words.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 27. To focus on the declarant\u2019s adoption of the statement at trial, the Commonwealth suggests, is simply absurd because a statement reaffirmed by a declarant at trial would never be \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the declarant\u2019s trial testimony, and thus would never be subject to the rules governing prior inconsistent statements. Because Wiley acknowledged at trial that he signed the statement when it was made, and the detective who interrogated him corroborated that Wiley made such statement, the Commonwealth concludes there is no question that Wiley adopted his prior inconsistent statement to police for purposes of determining admissibility pursuant to Lively. Hence, it asserts that the statement is admissible as substantive evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt, and trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to object or seek an unwarranted jury charge.\nThe PCRA court likewise found no arguable merit to Appellant\u2019s claim, holding that substantive use of Wiley\u2019s statement was proper and in compliance with the requisites of Lively because Wiley adopted his statement by signing it, the statement was inconsistent with testimony Wiley gave at trial, and Wiley was available for cross-examination. PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 8 (CP Philadelphia Jul. 2, 2008).\nWe agree with both the Commonwealth and the PCRA court that Appellant\u2019s claim fails for lack of arguable merit. Appellant\u2019s position that Wiley\u2019s statement was not \u201cadopted\u201d by him because he repudiated it at trial is untenable. Our holding in Lively is premised upon the notion that the statement sought to be admitted is, in fact, inconsistent with the testimony given by the witness at trial. Thus, as the Commonwealth recognizes, adoption of the statement by the witness at trial is unnecessary as it would obviate the need to incorporate the evidentiary rules for prior inconsistent statements. Wiley adopted his prior statement to police when he signed each page of the document. Both Wiley and the detective interrogating him confirmed this fact at trial. Thus, the requisites of Lively were satisfied and the jury was free to consider Wiley\u2019s prior statement to police for the truth of the matter asserted therein, and as substantive evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt. See Commonwealth v. Ragan, 538 Pa. 2, 645 A.2d 811, 818 (1994) (holding that a statement that the witness had previously given to police, which had been reduced to writing and signed by the witness, but which was repudiated by the witness at trial, was admissible as substantive evidence because the requirements of Lively were satisfied). Consequently, Appellant\u2019s claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness fails for lack of arguable merit.\nIII. Ineffectiveness for Failing to Refute Wiley\u2019s Prior Statement to Police\nAppellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to refute Wiley\u2019s statement to police by presenting evidentiary proof that Wiley\u2019s view of the crime was obstructed. He concedes that trial counsel suggested to the jury that Wiley\u2019s view was compromised by doing the following: (1) submitting into evidence a police photo, which showed two large vehicles parked in front of McCants\u2019 home; (2) asking McCants at trial whether a van, as shown in the police photo, had been parked in front of her residence, N.T. 3/2/2001 at 33-34; (3) asking Wiley at trial to note \u201cthe two blue vans\u201d in the photo, N.T. 3/5/2001 at 78; (4) eliciting Detective Mangold\u2019s acknowledgement that he had not asked Wiley about \u201cthe van being in his line of vision,\u201d Id. at 125; and (5) arguing to the jury that the van obstructed Wiley\u2019s view of the shootings. N.T. 3/6/2001 at 17-18. Appellant maintains, however, that merely suggesting to the jury that Wiley\u2019s view was obstructed was insufficient, and that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidentiary proof of the same.\nSpecifically, Appellant submits that had trial counsel conducted a reasonable investigation and interviewed McCants and her daughter-in-law prior to trial, he would have discovered that the witnesses believed Wiley could not have seen what he claimed to have seen from McCants\u2019 front door. He attached to his PCRA petition declarations from McCants and her daughter-in-law, indicating the same. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, Appendix, Volume II, Exhibit 13 at \u00b6 7 (wherein McCants declares \u201c[t]here is no way for anyone to see what happened from my doorway; the van was in the way\u201d); id. Exhibit 14 at \u00b6 2 (wherein Andrea Wilson asserts, \u201cthere is no possible way that [Wiley] could see what was happening on the street or who the shooter was. The door was closed!\u201d).\nIn further support of the claim that trial counsel should have presented evidentiary proof of Wiley\u2019s obstructed view, Appellant maintains that counsel should have sought funding to obtain a crime scene expert to opine as to the inability of Wiley to view the shootings from McCants\u2019 entryway. Attached to his PCRA petition is a declaration from a forensic investigation specialist, who asserted that he studied the crime scene and documentation relating to the case years after the offense, and concluded that Wiley\u2019s view of the shootings would have been obstructed had he been standing at the location set forth in his police statement. See id., Exhibit 17 at \u00b6 22 (wherein R. Robert Tressel opines that, based upon his measurements and calculations, it would be \u201cimpossible for Wiley to have seen what he purports to have seen from inside the threshold of [McCants\u2019] door\u201d). Thus, Appellant concludes there is arguable merit to his claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present the aforementioned evidentiary proof establishing that Wiley could not possibly have seen Appellant commit the offense, rather than merely suggesting the same to the jury.\nAs to the reasonable basis and prejudice prongs of the ineffectiveness test, Appellant emphasizes that Wiley\u2019s ability to see the crime from the doorway of McCants\u2019 home was crucial. Under these circumstances, he concludes, trial counsel could have had no reasonable basis for failing to present evidentiary proof of the obstructed view. Appellant further concludes that had the proffered evidence from McCants, Wilson, and the forensic investigation specialist been presented to the jury, it would have cast doubt on the truthfulness of Wiley\u2019s claimed observation. As this case is based on credibility, Appellant asserts, he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s omission because there is a reasonable likelihood that the .verdict would have been different if the jury was presented with the proffered evidence.\nThe Commonwealth responds that Appellant\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness fails for lack of a factual basis because trial counsel did, in fact, present evidence that Wiley\u2019s view of the crime scene from McCants\u2019 doorway was obstructed. It argues that trial counsel\u2019s failure to produce additional evidence to establish the same point cannot amount to ineffectiveness. Moreover, the Commonwealth submits that trial counsel could not have anticipated that McCants would recant her trial testimony and later assert that it would be impossible for Wiley to have viewed the crime. It further maintains that McCants\u2019 daughter-in-law\u2019s subsequent declaration that McCants\u2019 door was closed when the shootings occurred is unpersuasive because it is inconsistent with the testimony established at trial. Finally, the Commonwealth argues, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to hire a forensic investigation expert because the crime scene experts who actually investigated the scene at the time of the offense produced the helpful photograph of the van that trial counsel presented in support of his argument to the jury that Wiley\u2019s view was obstructed.\nThe PCRA court rejected Appellant\u2019s claim, finding that independent investigation by trial counsel would have been \u201csuperfluous\u201d because \u201ctrial counsel clearly presented evidence that the van would have obstructed Mr. Wiley\u2019s view from Ms. McCants\u2019 doorway.\u201d PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 7-8. The court further emphasized that Wiley\u2019s ability to see the shootings from that particular spot was not determinative of the trial\u2019s outcome because part of the defense strategy was to suggest that Wiley, himself, had committed the offense, making the positioning of the van irrelevant. Id. at 8.\nWe agree with the PCRA court that Appellant\u2019s claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness fails for lack of arguable merit. As noted, trial counsel directly questioned McCants about the location of the van, using crime scene photographs to support an argument to the jury that Wiley could not have seen what he claimed to have seen in his statement. He further reiterated the existence and position of the van in his cross-examination of Wiley and Detective Mangold. Hence, trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to present additional evidence of this sort. See Commonwealth v. Mason, 559 Pa. 500, 741 A.2d 708, 717-18 (1999) (holding that where proposed evidence is cumulative of testimony at trial, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to present it). Further, trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to obtain the opinion of an independent crime scene expert when the forensic investigators who actually examined the scene obtained evidence favorable to Appellant, which trial counsel utilized in his cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses. See Commonwealth v. Williams, 537 Pa. 1, 640 A.2d 1251, 1265 (1994) (holding that \u201ctrial counsel need not introduce expert testimony on his client\u2019s behalf if he is able effectively to cross-examine prosecution witnesses and elicit helpful testimony\u201d). Appellant, therefore, is not entitled to relief on this claim.\nIV. Ineffectiveness for Failing to Investigate Wiley\u2019s Background for Impeachment Purposes\nAppellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate Wiley\u2019s background to discover the following evidence, which could have been used to impeach and discredit Wiley: (1) Wiley\u2019s previous juvenile adjudication for theft; (2) Wiley\u2019s previous murder charges, which had been nolle prossed prior to Appellant\u2019s trial; (3) Wiley\u2019s previous criminal charges for, inter alia, robbery and attempted murder, which were pending at the time of Appellant\u2019s trial; and (4) an immunity agreement the Commonwealth purportedly offered to Wiley after he indicated at Appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing that he had no knowledge of the murders.\nRelating to the juvenile adjudication for theft, Appellant asserts, without further elaboration, that \u201ccounsel did not impeach Wiley with his juvenile adjudication for theft, though such impeachment would have been proper.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 30. As to Wiley\u2019s prior unrelated criminal charges (referenced as (2) and (3), supra), Appellant implies that the police may have used these charges against Wiley in an effort to obtain his statement implicating Appellant in the instant murder. He emphasizes that trial counsel did not seek discovery relating to such criminal charges, and did not question Detective Mangold or Wiley as to whether these incidents played a role in Wiley\u2019s encounter with police that led to the giving of his statement. As to the immunity agreement, Appellant offers only that \u201c[rjeasonably diligent counsel would have requested discovery regarding the specifics and scope of the offer made to Wiley.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 32. Appellant concludes that his ineffectiveness claim has arguable merit because trial counsel could have investigated these areas and used such evidence to impeach and discredit Wiley and his statement to police.\nAs to the second prong of the ineffectiveness test, Appellant asserts that trial counsel\u2019s omissions constitute \u201cinexplicable lapses,\u201d that could have no reasonable basis designed to effectuate his interests. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 32-33. He further claims that he was prejudiced because, had trial counsel discovered the proffered evidence, he could have provided the jury with compelling reason to discredit the single most important piece of evidence against Appellant \u2014 Wiley\u2019s statement. He emphasizes that had the jury been provided with a complete picture regarding Wiley and his dealings with police, there is a reasonable likelihood that the verdict would have been different. Finally, Appellant contends that the PCRA court abused its discretion by denying discovery and an evidentiary hearing on this issue.\nThe Commonwealth counters that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to impeach Wiley with the proffered evidence, which amounts to nothing more than unrelated criminal charges against Wiley that had been dismissed at the time of Appellant\u2019s trial, unrelated criminal charges against Wiley that had been pending at the time of Appellant\u2019s trial, and a non-existent immunity offer. Globally responding to all proffered items of evidence, the Commonwealth argues that there can be no arguable merit to Appellant\u2019s claim alleging trial counsel\u2019s failure to impeach Wiley because Wiley never testified favorably to the Commonwealth. By repudiating his prior statement to police at trial, the Commonwealth asserts that Wiley became a defense witness, and that it was \u201cin [Appellant\u2019s] interests not to impeach his testimony disavowing the authenticity and accuracy of his statement.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 34 (emphasis added).\nThe Commonwealth further addresses individually the purported items of impeachment evidence proffered by Appellant. Relating to the charges against Wiley that had previously been dismissed, the Commonwealth argues that the ineffectiveness claim fails because trial counsel would have had no reason to confront Wiley with these matters as they have no relevance to his credibility. As to the criminal charges pending against Wiley at the time of Appellant\u2019s trial, the Commonwealth submits that the jury was made aware of these charges when the prosecutor elicited such information on direct examination. See N.T. 3/5/2001 at 62 (wherein the prosecutor asked Wiley, \u201cafter you were interviewed by the police, you were down at the Police Administration Building, and you were arrested, for Felony charges not related to this case; is that correct?\u201d). Thus, it maintains, trial counsel cannot be faulted for failing to present evidence that was already admitted at trial. Moreover, the Commonwealth discounts as pure speculation Appellant\u2019s suggestion that the detective may have used Wiley\u2019s unrelated criminal activity to obtain his statement implicating Appellant. It concludes that Appellant\u2019s imagination cannot serve as a substitute for a legal ineffective assistance of counsel analysis.\nFinally, as to the purported immunity agreement, the Commonwealth asserts that it drafted such agreement as a precaution after Wiley announced his intention to invoke his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent at Appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing. It clarifies, however, that it never offered the immunity agreement to Wiley because Wiley\u2019s counsel determined that his proposed testimony would not implicate the Fifth Amendment. Thus, the Commonwealth maintains, the unexecuted immunity agreement was irrelevant and unavailable as evidence of impeachment.\nThe PCRA court ruled that Appellant\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective in his investigation of Wiley\u2019s background and in his cross-examination of Wiley was \u201cbaseless and unsupported by the record.\u201d PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 6. The court did not specifically address that component of the claim relating to Appellant\u2019s juvenile adjudication for theft. As to the dismissed and pending criminal charges, the court held that trial counsel correctly declined to cross-examine Wiley because Wiley\u2019s trial testimony was favorable to Appellant, in that he recanted his previous statement implicating Appellant in the murders. Hence, it noted that the Commonwealth, and not the defense, would desire to impeach Wiley\u2019s trial testimony with his prior statement. Id. at 7. The PCRA court concluded that \u201c[cjlearly, counsel made a strategic decision to show Wiley to be truthful at trial and to have lied in his prior statement.\u201d Id. at 7. Finally, it held that any attempted impeachment of Wiley with an immunity agreement would have been precluded because Wiley never received immunity from the Commonwealth.\nThe PCRA court\u2019s conclusion that trial counsel had a reasonable strategy in not cross-examining Wiley on the various items of evidence proffered herein is supported by the record, and free of legal error. Simply put, Wiley\u2019s testimony at trial was favorable to Appellant as it repudiated his previous statement implicating Appellant in the murders. We decline to hold that trial counsel rendered constitutionally deficient representation when he failed to impeach testimony favorable to his client. Had trial counsel cross-examined Wiley with the proffered evidence, as Appellant suggests, he would likely now be challenging counsel\u2019s performance in that regard.\nAlthough we appreciate that Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim is nuanced and is directed primarily at trial counsel\u2019s failure to \u201cimpeach\u201d Wiley\u2019s statement to police, rather than his trial testimony repudiating such statement, we find that Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the proffered evidence would have accomplished such result. First, Appellant has not demonstrated how Wiley\u2019s previous juvenile adjudication for theft would have served to discredit only Wiley\u2019s statement to police, but not his trial testimony in favor of Appellant. Second, Appellant has not demonstrated that Detective Mangold used Wiley\u2019s pending or dismissed criminal charges to induce Wiley to give a statement implicating Appellant in the instant murders. Appellant\u2019s suggestion that Detective Mangold may have done so is mere conjecture, not grounded in any evidence of record. To the contrary, Wiley testified that Detective Mangold threatened him with prosecution for the instant murders to obtain his statement implicating Appellant. Thus, the jury already possessed clear evidence from Wiley, himself, that his statement implicating Appellant had been coerced. Wiley never suggested at trial that Detective Mangold invoked improperly Wiley\u2019s dismissed or pending criminal charges during his interrogation. Third, Appellant has failed to demonstrate how an immunity agreement that was drafted by the Commonwealth, but was never offered to Wiley, would have served to discredit Wiley\u2019s statement to police. We emphasize that this is a collateral proceeding at which Appellant, as petitioner, bears the burden of proving entitlement to his claim. Appellant has failed to do so here, and this ineffectiveness claim fails for lack of arguable merit.\nWe further conclude that the PCRA court did not abuse its discretion by denying discovery and an evidentiary hearing on this meritless claim. We review the denial of a discovery request in post-conviction proceedings for abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Bryant, 579 Pa. 119, 855 A.2d 726, 749-50 (2004). Discovery requests in the context of a PCRA petition in a death penalty case are addressed in Pennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 902(E)(2), which provides as follows:\nOn the first counseled petition in a death penalty case, no discovery shall be permitted at any stage of the proceedings, except upon leave of court after a showing of good cause.\nPa.R.Crim.P. 902(E)(2). We have held that a \u201cshowing of good cause requires more than just a generic demand for potentially exculpatory evidence.... \u201d Commonwealth v. Chambers, 570 Pa. 3, 807 A.2d 872, 889 (2002); see also Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, 553 Pa. 485, 720 A.2d 79, 91-92 & n. 15 (1998) (\u201cwholesale discovery of whatever information [petitioner] \u2018believed\u2019 to exist and/or of entire files so that he could discern whether his assertions were true\u201d exceeds permitted discovery). Appellant has failed to demonstrate good cause for further discovery on this claim.\nRegarding the trial court\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing, we reiterate that Pa. R.Crim.P. 909, which governs PCRA petitions in capital cases, provides that the PCRA court has the discretion to dismiss a petition -without a hearing when the court is satisfied \u201cthat there are no genuine issues concerning any material fact, the defendant is not entitled to post-conviction collateral relief, and no legitimate purpose would be served by any further proceedings.\u201d Pa.R.Crim.P. 909(B)(2). \u201c[T]o obtain reversal of a PCRA court\u2019s decision to dismiss a petition without a hearing, an appellant must show that he raised a genuine issue of fact which, if resolved in his favor, would have entitled him to relief, or that the court otherwise abused its discretion in denying a hearing.\u201d Commonwealth v. DAmato, 579 Pa. 490, 856 A.2d 806, 820 (2004). Appellant has failed to satisfy this burden as his reliance on speculation, and failure to assert facts, which, if believed, would support his claim cannot be equated with a genuine issue concerning a material fact that warrants an evidentiary hearing.\nV. Ineffectiveness in Failing to Investigate McCants\u2019 and Wilson\u2019s Background for Impeachment Purposes\nAppellant next contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate facts that could have been used to impeach Commonwealth witnesses, McCants and Wilson, to undermine Wiley\u2019s statement to police, and to support the defense that Wiley was the perpetrator. As noted, McCants\u2019 testimony placed Appellant at the scene of the crime moments before the murder occurred, established that Wiley was inside McCants\u2019 home at the time the fatal shots were fired, and identified the ski hat and sunglasses found at the scene as having been worn by Appellant earlier that afternoon. Wilson, who is McCants\u2019 daughter-in-law, corroborated McCants\u2019 testimony in significant part.\nThe purported items of impeachment evidence that Appellant faults trial counsel for failing to investigate and present are as follows: (1) McCants\u2019 prior inconsistent statements implicating Wiley in the murders; (2) a 911 call made from McCants\u2019 residence at the time of the shootings; and (3) McCants\u2019 background and character, including her previous use of aliases, her reputation for dishonesty, and her prior contact with police as a Commonwealth witness.\nA. McCants\u2019 Prior Inconsistent Statements\nAppellant asserts that, on the day of the shootings, McCants made statements to police implicating Wiley in the instant murders and establishing that he ran into her home after shots had been fired, which was inconsistent with her trial testimony that Wiley was inside her home when the shots rang out. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, Appendix, Volume II at 20 (wherein Sergeant McCuster indicates in a police investigation interview record that McCants told him that both Wiley and Appellant were at McCants\u2019 residence, that both men left the home, that McCants heard gunshots seconds later, and that Wiley thereafter returned to the house); see also id. at 19 (wherein Officer Maury reports that McCants informed him that she believed Wiley and Appellant may have committed the murders). Appellant concludes that trial counsel\u2019s failure to confront McCants with her prior inconsistent statements constituted deficient performance under Strickland because the statements undermined Wiley\u2019s \u201calibi\u201d and demonstrated that Wiley was in a position to have committed the crimes and had a motive to lie to police and falsely implicate Appellant. He argues that trial counsel could have had no reasonable basis for failing to impeach McCants\u2019 testimony in this regard. Finally, Appellant maintains, he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s omission because had counsel confronted McCants with these statements, he would have exposed the lack of integrity in the Commonwealth\u2019s case.\nThe Commonwealth responds that Appellant\u2019s claim clearly lacks arguable merit because the evidence that he argues trial counsel should have presented actually implicates Appellant in the murders. As the police reports reveal, McCants initially informed the officers that she believed both Wiley and Appellant committed the murders. For this reason alone, the Commonwealth maintains, trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to impeach McCants with her prior inconsistent statements. The Commonwealth further points out that trial counsel had a reasonable strategy in not impeaching McCants with her prior inconsistent statements because McCants had also given police a detailed prior consistent statement on the night of the murders, outlining how Wiley did not leave her home until after the gunshots were fired. Because McCants was not impeached, the Commonwealth asserts that it never introduced her prior consistent statement.\nThe PCRA court found no merit to Appellant\u2019s claim, ruling that the \u201calibi\u201d that McCants provided for Wiley had nothing to do with Appellant\u2019s involvement in the shootings because the only relevant inquiry was whether Wiley witnessed the murders. PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 13. It found reasonable trial counsel\u2019s strategy of arguing to the jury that Wiley\u2019s original statement implicating Appellant had been coerced and that his recantation at trial was truthful. Id. The court held that trial counsel had an interest in steering the jury away from examining Wiley\u2019s precise location at the time of the shootings, and keeping the focus on Wiley\u2019s recantation of his original statement. Id.\nWe agree with the PCRA court that Appellant\u2019s claim fails as trial counsel acted reasonably in declining to impeach McCants with her prior inconsistent statements because such statements implicated Appellant in the instant offense. See Commonwealth v. Small, 602 Pa. 425, 980 A.2d 549, 565 (2009) (holding that the failure to impeach a witness on a particular ground cannot constitute ineffective assistance of counsel if trial counsel had a reasonable strategy for not so impeaching).\nB. The 911 Call\nAppellant asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain and use at trial the police department\u2019s audiotape of a 911 call reporting the shootings, which was made from McCants\u2019 residence by a female caller. Appellant asserts that in the background of the 911 call, you can hear a second female saying to another individual (purportedly, Wiley), \u201c[d]on\u2019t run into the police.\u201d While there was some confusion as to who made the background statement at issue, Appellant asserts that he learned after the PCRA proceedings had concluded that McCants\u2019 daughter-in-law, Wilson, made the statement. Appellant argues that the background statement, \u201c[d]on\u2019t run into the police,\u201d supports the inference that Wiley was involved in the crime, and that his involvement was apparent to Wilson. According to Appellant, this is consistent with the defense theory that it was Wiley, and not Appellant, who murdered the victims. He concludes that trial counsel\u2019s failure to secure and present the 911 tape to the jury fell below the level of reasonable performance required by Strickland, and that he was prejudiced thereby.\nThe Commonwealth counters that Appellant\u2019s claim lacks arguable merit because the 911 call had no impeachment value. It maintains that directing one not to \u201crun into the police\u201d does not necessarily imply criminality and, in any event, would not have been exculpatory to Appellant. Moreover, the Commonwealth points out, Wilson confirmed in her affidavit obtained for the PCRA proceeding that Wiley was inside McCants\u2019 home at the time the shootings occurred. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, Appendix, Volume II at 14. Thus, it maintains, any attempt to use Wilson\u2019s background statement recorded in the 911 call to suggest incrimination of Wiley fails.\nThe PCRA court denied Appellant relief on this claim. Initially, it noted that Appellant failed to meet its burden of establishing the identity of the declarant of the statement at issue. Even assuming Appellant\u2019s assertions regarding the nature of the 911 call were true, it held that Appellant was not prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to present the audiotape to the jury because it would not have influenced the verdict. PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 12. The court emphasized that a \u201csuggestion that one not run into the police is hardly evidence of guilt or cover-up.\u201d Id.\nWe concur in the PCRA court\u2019s conclusion that Appellant\u2019s claim fails. The claim lacks arguable merit because the 911 call lacked impeachment value as it did not serve to discredit Wilson\u2019s testimony. Wilson testified that Wiley was present inside McCants\u2019 home when the shooting occurred. The 911 call, in which Wilson warns Wiley to stay away from police, does nothing to discredit this particular assertion, and reaffirms that Wiley was, in fact, inside McCants\u2019 residence when the murders occurred. Given Appellant\u2019s previous claims in which he details Wiley\u2019s extensive previous criminal charges, it is not beyond credulity that Wilson would caution Wiley against being found near a crime-scene murder investigation. Trial counsel cannot be deemed to have provided constitutionally deficient representation based on his failure to elicit such a minor point on cross-examination. See Commonwealth v. Baez, 554 Pa. 66, 720 A.2d 711, 734 (1998) (holding that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to elicit a minor inconsistency in the witness\u2019 testimony).\nC. McCants\u2019 Background and Character\nAppellant asserts that trial counsel failed to investigate the following evidence of McCants\u2019 background and character, and to use such evidence to impeach her testimony at Appellant\u2019s trial: (1) McCants\u2019 previous use of aliases; (2) McCants\u2019 \u201cprior contacts\u201d \"with police as a Commonwealth witness; and (3) McCants\u2019 reputation for dishonesty.\n1. McCants\u2019 Use of Aliases\nAppellant contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach McCants with her previous use of aliases, instead of stipulating to such fact. The record demonstrates that trial counsel and the Commonwealth entered into a stipulation, which was read to the jury, stating that in 1975 Catherine McCants used the name Barbara Johnson; in 1979, she used the name Barbara Anderson; and in 1983, she used the name Catharine Estridge. N.T. 3/5/2001 at 140. Appellant argues that trial counsel\u2019s failure to impeach McCants with her use of aliases rendered his performance constitutionally deficient because impeachment of McCants in this regard would have demonstrat\u00e9d \u201cMcCants\u2019 willingness to deceive.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 38. He suggests that the \u201cjury never had the benefit of hearing and observing McCants when she was confronted with this information.\u201d Id. Appellant submits that there was no reasonable basis for trial counsel\u2019s failure to cross-examine McCants on this matter. Finally, Appellant reiterates the global claim of prejudice arising from trial counsel\u2019s failure to impeach McCants with the several items of proffered evidence. He argues that had trial counsel effectively impeached McCants\u2019 testimony that placed Appellant at the scene of the crime and linked him to the crime through physical evidence, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different.\nThe Commonwealth argues that this claim is meritless because trial counsel acted reasonably in stipulating that McCants had used different names in the past. It submits that Appellant has failed to demonstrate entitlement to relief as he has not explained how confronting McCants with her marriages and divorces, and her purported \u201caliases\u201d would have discredited her testimony in any way.\nSimilarly, the PCRA court held that this claim was \u201cfrivolous\u201d because Appellant \u201cdoes not explain, nor can this court imagine, how confronting Ms. McCants with the aliases and thereby giving her a chance to explain them away would have helped his case.\u201d PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 14.\nWe find no legal error in the PCRA court\u2019s ruling that Appellant has failed to demonstrate entitlement to relief on this claim. We, therefore, reject this claim for lack of arguable merit.\n2. McCants\u2019 Prior Police Contacts\nAppellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach McCants with evidence that she acted as a Commonwealth witness in unrelated cases, which purportedly demonstrates her possible ties to the prosecution. He asserts that the prosecutor informed trial counsel during the preliminary hearing that McCants had previously testified for the Commonwealth, but that Appellant had no details regarding the extent of such contacts with the prosecution because the PCRA court denied his request for discovery on this claim. His present claim of ineffectiveness challenges trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate such contacts in an effort to demonstrate McCants\u2019 bias toward the Commonwealth.\nIn response, the Commonwealth categorizes Appellant\u2019s claim as mere speculation because he has failed to demonstrate how McCants\u2019 testifying for the Commonwealth in unidentified and unrelated cases serves to impeach her testimony against Appellant in this case. It asserts that Appellant\u2019s utter failure to substantiate his claim renders it merit-less.\nThe PCRA court concurred with the Commonwealth, finding that there was no indication that any of McCants\u2019 prior contacts with police were related to this case. Moreover, it concluded that such evidence would not be admissible as character evidence against McCants because Pa.R.E. 608(b)(1) precludes attacks upon the character of a witness based upon specific instances of conduct of the witness. See Pa.R.E. 608(b)(1) (prohibiting the admission of evidence relating to specific instances of conduct of a witness unless such specific instances are otherwise admissible as prior criminal record). The court further held that even if McCants\u2019 prior contacts with police were admissible, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that trial counsel\u2019s failure to impeach McCants with such evidence prejudiced him because McCants was not an eyewitness to the crime. The PCRA court emphasized that McCants was not the only witness who placed Appellant at the scene of the crime; her daughter-in-law, Andrea Wilson, corroborated McCants\u2019 testimony. Thus, the court concluded that the outcome of the trial would not have been different had trial counsel impeached McCants\u2019 testimony with her prior police contacts.\nAgain, we find no error in the PCRA court\u2019s ruling. Simply put, Appellant has failed to link McCants\u2019 testimony in favor of the Commonwealth in unrelated cases with the credibility of her testimony against him in the instant case. Thus, the claim fails for lack of arguable merit.\n3. McCants\u2019 Reputation for Dishonesty\nAppellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to impeach McCants with evidence of her reputation for dishonesty, which could have been demonstrated by various witnesses from whom PCRA counsel obtained declarations. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, Appendix, Volume II at 22, 24, 26, & 30 (wherein four relatives of Appellant assert that McCants was violent, sold drugs, and had a reputation for not telling the truth to police and others). Appellant reiterates that trial counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to impeach McCants with the aforementioned evidence, considering the significance of her testimony that linked Appellant to the physical evidence found at the crime scene. He further concludes that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s omission because exposing McCants\u2019 bias and dishonesty would have given the jury substantial reason to doubt her testimony, and there is a reasonable likelihood that the outcome of the trial would have been different.\nThe Commonwealth responds that trial counsel cannot be faulted for failing to call Appellant\u2019s relatives to demonstrate McCants\u2019 negative reputation when he has failed to demonstrate that trial counsel knew these witnesses existed, or that they were available or willing to testify. Moreover, the Commonwealth questions the admissibility of the declarations of Appellant\u2019s family members, as it finds that the declarations relate more to specific instances of McCants\u2019 conduct, which are inadmissible under Pa.R.E. 608(b)(1), than to her reputation for dishonesty.\nThe PCRA court rejected Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim on the same basis. It found that most of the testimony that Appellant now presents would have related to specific instances of McCants\u2019 misconduct and, therefore, would have been inadmissible under Pa.R.E. 608(b)(1). It noted that because Appellant did not maintain that McCants had been convicted of a crimen falsi offense, evidence of specific instances of her conduct clearly would not have been admissible at trial. To the extent the declarations actually addressed McCants\u2019 reputation for dishonesty and not merely specific instances of her conduct, the PCRA court held that Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim failed because he did not demonstrate that trial counsel knew that the proffered witnesses, Appellant\u2019s family members, were available and willing to testify. Finally, the court found that even if trial counsel was aware of such witnesses and of their willingness to testify, Appellant was not prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to present such witnesses at trial.\nWe conclude that the PCRA court\u2019s findings are supported by the record and are free from legal error. The declarations Appellant proffers primarily address specific instances of McCants\u2019 conduct, ie., her specific acts of violence, threats of violence, or deception, which would have been inadmissible to attack her credibility under Pa.R.E. 608(b)(1). See Commonwealth v. Chmiel, 585 Pa. 547, 889 A.2d 501, 534-35 (2005) (recognizing that Pa.R.E. 608(b) precludes the admission of specific instances of misconduct to attack a witness\u2019 character for truthfulness; while Pa.R.E. 609(a) requires an actual conviction of a crime involving dishonesty or false statement in order for a witness\u2019s credibility to be attacked with evidence of the crime). As to any remaining assertions in the declarations that actually related to McCants\u2019 reputation for dishonesty, we find dispositive that Appellant failed to establish that the four individuals who provided declarations were known or should have been known to trial counsel. See id., 889 A.2d at 546 (holding that to prevail on a claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failure to call a witness, a defendant must prove: (1) the witness existed; (2) the witness was available; (3) trial counsel was informed of the existence of the witness or should have known of the witness\u2019s existence; (4) the witness was prepared to cooperate and would have testified on appellant\u2019s behalf; and (5) the absence of the testimony prejudiced appellant). To the extent that Appellant faults trial counsel for failing to investigate these witnesses, we note that the proposed witnesses were Appellant\u2019s family members, and we fail to see why Appellant, himself, could not have alerted trial counsel to their existence, rather than faulting counsel for failing to investigate the same. See Commonwealth v. Uderra, 550 Pa. 389, 706 A.2d 334, 340 (1998) (holding that \u201c[a]ppellant\u2019s own failure to cooperate with counsel in order to apprise him of allegedly relevant information cannot now provide a basis for ineffectiveness claims.\u201d).\nVI. Ineffectiveness for Failing to Object to Detective Mangold\u2019s Testimony\nAppellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object and request a cautionary instruction during the direct examination of Detective Mangold when the prosecutor\u2019s questioning gave the false impression that evidence known to the detective, but not introduced at trial, supported Wiley\u2019s statement. He further contends that trial counsel enhanced the impact of that improper testimony by eliciting Detective Mangold\u2019s personal belief in the truth of Wiley\u2019s accusations against Appellant. Appellant maintains that these combined errors violated his right to due process and his right to a fair and a reliable verdict, and thus his ineffectiveness claim has arguable merit. He relies on the following testimony:\nPROSECUTOR: Did you ever show him [Wiley] any documents, any interviews from other witnesses, that were taken during the course of this investigation?\nDETECTIVE MANGOLD: I didn\u2019t show him any documents, but in the statement, I confronted him, about halfway through, with some of the facts that I learned from Detective Reinhold, and from other interviews that I had read.\nPROSECUTOR: What did you say to him?\nDETECTIVE MANGOLD: Basically, he was lying in the beginning of his statement. He was placing himself inside his aunt\u2019s house the whole time prior to this incident, and he stated that he didn\u2019t see the shooting; he only heard it from inside, when, in fact, we knew that he had gone into the house\u2014\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection, Your Honor, to \u201cWe knew.\u201d\nTHE COURT: Sustained.\nPROSECUTOR: So, you confronted him with certain information as to when he went into his aunt\u2019s house?\nDETECTIVE MANGOLD: That\u2019s correct.\nN.T. 3/5/2001 at 102-03.\nAppellant recognizes that trial counsel lodged an objection, but emphasizes that he failed to request a cautionary instruction prohibiting the jury from considering any references to \u201cextra-record\u201d sources of information implicating Appellant\u2019s guilt. He maintains that trial counsel compounded this error when, later in his cross-examination of Detective Mangold, trial counsel himself questioned the detective about how he confronted Wiley with other information he had learned about the incident. Id. at 122 (wherein Detective Mangold responds, \u201cI confronted him with this halfway through the interview, and I told him, \u2018You are not telling me the truth, and you better get on board with it,\u2019 and he did\u201d). Appellant further complains that trial counsel repeated this error on redirect when he asked Detective Mangold about his basis of knowledge of the crime at the time of the interrogation. In support of this assertion, Appellant cites the following exchange:\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: When you told [Wiley] about these inconsistencies that you saw [in Wiley\u2019s initial version of how the shooting occurred], you said that you are not sure what you told [Wiley]. At that time, did you have any information as to the actual way that the shooting went? Do you understand what I am saying? Did you suggest to [Wiley] that you had information as to where [Appellant] was, and where Mr. Wise was, and where Rodney Walters was, at the time that they were shot?\nDETECTIVE MANGOLD: I didn\u2019t give him details and facts about the case. I indicated to him that I had spoken to his godmom, that I had been to her home, and that I had spoken to other people who witnessed parts of this. That is what I confronted him -with, that it was impossible for him not to have seen this.\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: Objection, Your Honor; move to strike.\nTHE COURT: That is just what he said. Jurors, it is not whether it is true or not; it is just what he told him.\nId. at 129-30 (emphasis added). Despite trial counsel\u2019s objection and the trial court\u2019s cautionary instruction, Appellant argues that counsel was nevertheless ineffective because Detective Mangold\u2019s testimony that \u201cit was impossible for [Wiley] not to have witnessed the shooting\u201d suggested to the jury that there was additional evidence not presented at trial that supported the version of events set forth in Wiley\u2019s statement to police. Id.\nFinally, Appellant submits that trial counsel made matters worse by eliciting the following testimony from Detective Mangold regarding his personal opinion of the credibility of Wiley\u2019s accusations against Appellant.\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: So, you think that [Wiley] is lying?\nDETECTIVE MANGOLD: I think that he took part in the planning of these Murders. I don\u2019t think that he is lying. I think that he took part in the planning and chickened out at the last second because he was on his godmother\u2019s block, and he didn\u2019t want to be seen taking part in this.\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: That is what he said in the statement, is that right?\nDETECTIVE MANGOLD: I believed him.\nDEFENSE COUNSEL: What you believe doesn\u2019t count, is that right?\nDETECTIVE MANGOLD: No sir.\nId. at 132. Regardless of trial counsel\u2019s clarification that what the detective personally believed was irrelevant, Appellant reiterates that this questioning constituted ineffectiveness because it elicited improperly Detective Mangold\u2019s opinion regarding the veracity of Wiley\u2019s statement.\nAs to remaining prongs of the ineffectiveness standard, Appellant maintains that trial counsel\u2019s strategy was unreasonable, and that he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s performance because the jury\u2019s assessment of the credibility and reliability of Wiley\u2019s statement to police was fundamental to its verdict. Hence, Appellant maintains, there is a reasonable likelihood that had trial counsel taken the appropriate actions, the jury\u2019s assessment of Wiley\u2019s statement, and its verdict, would have been different.\nThe Commonwealth responds that Appellant\u2019s claim lacks arguable merit because the record clearly demonstrates that trial counsel, in fact, objected to the statements at issue, that such objections were sustained, at least in part, by the trial court, and that the trial court expressly cautioned the jury against accepting as true Detective Mangold\u2019s statement that it was impossible for Wiley not to have observed the murder. Moreover, it submits that Detective Mangold\u2019s testimony was proper because it explained the actions he took that led Wiley to change his story regarding what occurred on the night of the shootings. See Commonwealth v. Hamilton, 543 Pa. 612, 673 A.2d 915, 918 (1996) (holding that evidence of what other individuals reported to a policeman was admissible, not for the truth of the matter asserted, but to show the information upon which the police acted). Because the trial court made certain that the jury understood the purpose for which the evidence was introduced, the Commonwealth concludes that there is no basis for Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim.\nThe PCRA court denied relief on this claim. It held that trial counsel did object when Detective Mangold attempted to explain his knowledge of the events on the day of the murder, and the trial court sustained this objection. PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 10. The court emphasized that trial counsel again objected when the detective attempted to explain the inconsistencies about which he confronted Wiley, after which the trial court expressly instructed the jury that Detective Mangold\u2019s opinion should not be accepted as fact. Id. The PCRA court further found \u201cfrivolous\u201d Appellant\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to Detective Mangold\u2019s testimony that he believed Wiley was telling the truth when he implicated Appellant. Id. at 11. The court reasoned that Detective Mangold\u2019s belief that Appellant was guilty, which he held prior to interviewing Wiley, supported the defense theory that Wiley had no choice but to implicate Appellant in the murder. Id. It asserted that trial counsel used this testimony to Appellant\u2019s advantage in the closing argument when he argued that Wiley was forced to tell the truth, \u201cas the detective believed the truth to be, and if he didn\u2019t give that truth, [Wiley] would still be down there.\u201d Id. (citing N.T. 3/6/2001 at 15-16).\nThe PCRA court\u2019s conclusion is supported by the record and free of legal error. Considering that trial counsel objected to the statements at issue, and the trial court cautioned the jury, albeit briefly, against considering the detective\u2019s testimony for the truth of the matter asserted, there remains no factual predicate upon which to base an ineffectiveness challenge. Thus, the claim fails for lack of arguable merit. We decline to deem trial counsel\u2019s performance constitutionally deficient when Appellant has failed to articulate what further action he should have taken in this regard.\nVII. Ineffectiveness for Failing to Request a Corrupt Source Charge\nAppellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a corrupt source charge in connection with the trial testimony of Wiley. He maintains that the jury should have been informed that Wiley is a corrupt and polluted source because he was an accomplice to the murders, and, therefore, his testimony should be viewed with caution. Although he concedes that Wiley was not charged as an accomplice, Appellant argues that there is arguable merit to his ineffectiveness claim because the evidence of record permitted the inference that Wiley was an accomplice. In support of this assertion, he points out that the police initially viewed Wiley as a suspect. He further notes that Wiley fled from McCants\u2019 residence immediately after the shootings and made an unsolicited statement to a neighbor, indicating that he had nothing to do with the crimes. Finally, he asserts that Detective Mangold\u2019s testimony, that he believed Wiley took part in the planning of the murders, supported an inference that Wiley acted as an accomplice.\nRegarding the reasonable basis prong of the ineffectiveness standard, Appellant submits that a corrupt source charge regarding Wiley could only have assisted the defense, and \u201cthere could be no reason, other than neglect, for counsel to have failed to request the instruction.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 54. Finally, Appellant maintains that he satisfied the prejudice prong because there is a reasonable probability that had a corrupt source charge been given, the jury would have had a legal basis to reject Wiley\u2019s trustworthiness, and would not have credited Wiley\u2019s statement to police, which was the primary evidence against him.\nThe Commonwealth counters that trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to request a corrupt source charge because Appellant was not entitled to such instruction. It emphasizes that a corrupt source charge is only required where the evidence is sufficient to present a jury question as to whether the Commonwealth witness was an accomplice. Here, the Commonwealth maintains, there is absolutely no evidence that Wiley assisted in the crime. It asserts that the record supports nothing more than Detective Mangold\u2019s theory that Wiley may have participated in the planning of the murders. However, the Commonwealth points out that there was no evidence in support of the detective\u2019s theory. It reiterates that Wiley testified that he knew nothing about the crime, and his statement implicating Appellant did not additionally implicate Wiley, himself, in any way. Instead, Wiley indicated in his statement to police that he declined Appellant\u2019s invitation to take part in the shootings.\nThe PCRA court rejected Appellant\u2019s claim on a similar basis. It held that the ineffectiveness claim fails because \u201cWiley has not been charged as an accomplice, and there is no evidence to permit an inference that he was an accomplice.\u201d PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 19. Acknowledging that Wiley\u2019s statement indicated his awareness of Appellant\u2019s intent to rob the victim, the court found that such knowledge was insufficient to support an inference that Wiley was an accomplice. Id. at 19-20 (citing Commonwealth v. Carey, 293 Pa.Super. 359, 439 A.2d 151, 158 (1981) (holding that an accomplice is one who \u201cknowingly and voluntarily cooperates with or aids another in the commission of a crime\u201d)). It further dismissed Appellant\u2019s reliance on Detective Mangold\u2019s \u201ctheory\u201d that Wiley may have participated in the planning of the crime as \u201cunsupported elsewhere in the record.\u201d Id. at 20.\nThe PCRA court\u2019s determination is supported by the record and free of legal error. This Court has held that it \u201cis well established that, in any case in which an accomplice implicates the defendant, the trial court should instruct the jury that the accomplice is a corrupt and polluted source whose testimony should be considered with caution.\u201d Commonwealth v. Williams, 557 Pa. 207, 732 A.2d 1167, 1181 (1999); Commonwealth v. Chmiel, 639 A.2d at 13. The charge is warranted where the evidence is sufficient to present a jury question with respect to whether the Commonwealth\u2019s witness is an accomplice. Williams, 732 A.2d at 1181. An accomplice is one who aids or agrees or attempts to aid such other person in planning or committing the offense. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 306(c)(1)(h).\nHere, as the PCRA court held, there was no evidence that Wiley assisted or aided Appellant in the planning or execution of the murders. Rather, Wiley testified that he declined Appellant\u2019s previous request for him to join in the commission of the offenses. While Appellant argued to the jury that Wiley may have been the perpetrator instead of Appellant, and Detective Mangold expressed his belief that Wiley may have been involved in the planning stage, there was no evidence presented supporting either of these notions. Further, contrary to Appellant\u2019s assertions, police suspicion of Wiley and Wiley\u2019s unsolicited comment that he had nothing to do with the shootings are insufficient to present a jury question as to whether Wiley was an accomplice. Thus, the ineffectiveness claim fails for lack of arguable merit. Moreover, we fail to see why trial counsel would have requested an instruction informing the jury that Wiley is a corrupt and polluted source whose testimony should be view with great caution. As noted, Wiley testified favorably for the defense at trial by repudiating his previous statement implicating Appellant. The reasonable defense strategy presented was to suggest to the jury that Wiley\u2019s trial testimony was truthful and that his previous statement to police had been coerced.\nVIII. Ineffectiveness for Stipulating that Appellant Possessed a Large Sum of Money When Arrested\nAppellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for stipulating that on January 21,1999, when he was arrested for the murders of Wise and Walters that occurred nearly one week before, he had $1,169.00 in cash in his possession. N.T. 3/5/2001 at 137. He maintains that while the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the case was that he murdered the victims during the commission of a robbery, there was no evidence that any money or goods were actually stolen. To the contrary, he asserts, at the time of the victims\u2019 deaths, $184 was found in Wise\u2019s pocket, and $318 was found on Walters. Appellant contends that despite the absence of proof of a robbery, trial counsel not only failed to object to the Commonwealth\u2019s presentation of irrelevant and prejudicial evidence of a substantial amount of money found on him at the time of his arrest, but stipulated to such fact. He claims that based on the passage of time between the murders and his arrest, there was no rational basis upon which the jurors could infer that the cash found on Appellant at the time of his arrest was stolen from the victims. Nevertheless, Appellant asserts, in her closing argument, the prosecutor urged the jury to make such a connection. The prosecutor stated as follows:\nWe have put in evidence, and stipulated to evidence, that this Defendant was found with $1,100 in his pocket. Mr. Wise still had $300 in his pocket, I believe, and Rodney Walters also had a substantial sum. Rodney Walters and Milson Wise were engaged in numbers running, engaged in what is an illegal activity. They were making money from that. You heard that they had various numbers on them. Other people talked about paying them for their numbers.\nDid Milton Wise have a large sum of money with him that day that was not in his pockets? I submit to you that the inference is that he probably did, but it doesn\u2019t really matter. It doesn\u2019t really matter if you believe that the Defendant was out on that street, after telling Eric Wiley that he was going to get Milton Wise and Rodney Walters, after telling Eric Wiley that he was going to jam, to rob, Milton Wise and Rodney Walters [...].\nN.T. 3/06/01 at 52-52.\nAppellant submits that the admission of this irrelevant and prejudicial evidence, as stipulated by trial counsel, and which was emphasized in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, denied him of his right to a fair trial and a reliable verdict, thus lending arguable merit to his claim of trial counsel ineffectiveness. Regarding the reasonable basis prong of the ineffectiveness test, he argues that because \u201cthere is no conceivable nonprejudicial use to which the jury could put this evidence, counsel\u2019s stipulation, instead of an objection to the admission of the evidence, was not reasonably designed to further his client\u2019s interests.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 59. Finally, Appellant contends that he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s stipulation because, had counsel objected to the admission of the evidence, there is a reasonable likelihood that the outcome of the trial would have been different.\nThe Commonwealth responds that there is no arguable merit to Appellant\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for entering into the stipulation because the evidence was admissible, and any defense objection would have been futile. It submits that it was not required to provide \u201cconclusive proof\u2019 that the cash came from the robbery in order for the evidence to have been admitted. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 50. According to the Commonwealth, it only had to show sufficient circumstances to justify an inference establishing a material element of a crime. See Commonwealth v. Treiber, 582 Pa. 646, 874 A.2d 26, 32 (2005) (holding that evidence is relevant if it logically tends to establish a material fact in the case, tends to make a fact at issue more or less probable, or supports a reasonable inference or presumption regarding the existence of a material fact). The Commonwealth contends that because the jury could reasonably infer that the substantial cash found on Appellant six days after the incident came from the robbery, the evidence was admissible, and trial counsel had no basis to object. It emphasizes that lack of proof that Appellant obtained the large amount of cash from the robbery of Wise and Walters goes to the weight of the evidence, and not its admissibility. Trial counsel highlighted this point, the Commonwealth asserts, in his closing argument when he alleged that any connection between the money and the robbery was speculation, and the fact that the victims still had money in their pockets after the shootings militated against a finding of robbery. N.T. 3/6/01 at 11. Moreover, the Commonwealth asserts, because trial counsel acted reasonably by stipulating to such fact instead of affording the Commonwealth the opportunity to emphasize it via live testimony, Appellant has failed to demonstrate a lack of reasonable basis for trial counsel\u2019s performance in this regard.\nThe PCRA court agreed with the Commonwealth that Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim lacked arguable merit, and held that there was \u201cmore than enough evidence to support a reasonable inference that the money [recovered from Appellant upon arrest] was the robbery proceeds.\u201d PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 18. It echoed the Commonwealth\u2019s sentiments that a jury could reasonably infer that the large sum of cash was the proceeds of the robbery, and that the lack of conclusive proof went to the weight, rather than admissibility, of the evidence. The court concluded that because the evidence was clearly admissible, trial counsel had no basis to object to its admission, and his failure to do so cannot support a finding of ineffectiveness.\nWe find no error in the PCRA court\u2019s determination. The evidence at trial established that the murder victims \u201cran numbers\u201d and were likely to possess large amounts of cash. Thus, the fact that Appellant told Wiley that he wanted to rob the victims for this reason, and was arrested six days after the murders with $1167 on his person, supports an inference that the money he possessed at the time of his arrest was, in fact, the proceeds of the robbery. See Commonwealth v. Kennedy, 598 Pa. 621, 959 A.2d 916, 923 (2008) (holding that evidence is relevant if it tends to establish a material fact, makes a fact at issue more or less probable, or supports a reasonable inference or presumption regarding a material fact). Because the evidence to which trial counsel stipulated was relevant to a material fact, ie., Appellant\u2019s commission of a robbery, it was admissible. As such, trial counsel acted reasonably by stipulating to the fact, rather than having the Commonwealth present live testimony of the same. See Commonwealth v. Saxton, 516 Pa. 196, 532 A.2d 352, 357 (1987) (holding that trial counsel was not ineffective, and instead made a reasonably-based strategic choice when he stipulated to evidence to avoid the more harmful impact of admission of the evidence on cross-examination of the defendant).\nIX. Ineffectiveness for Failing to Object to Prosecutorial Misconduct\nAppellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the following improper comments made by the prosecutor during summation: (1) misstating stipulations regarding the lack of DNA evidence; (2) vouching for Detective Mangold\u2019s credibility and making misleading arguments; (3) vouching for the truthfulness of Wiley\u2019s statement implicating Appellant in the murders; (4) denouncing Wiley\u2019s trial testimony, which repudiated his previous statement to police; (5) misstating facts regarding Wiley\u2019s view of the offense; (6) assuring that Wiley was not the killer; (7) vouching for McCants\u2019 credibility; and (8) misstating the law regarding the robbery charge. As detailed below, we find that each of these claims, which challenge nearly every aspect of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, lack arguable merit.\nWe begin by reviewing the relevant general legal principles, and then address each of Appellant\u2019s sub-issues. A claim of ineffective assistance grounded in trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to a prosecutor\u2019s conduct \u201cmay succeed when the petitioner demonstrates that the prosecutor\u2019s actions violated a constitutionally or statutorily protected right, such as the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination or the Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial, or a constitutional interest such as due process.\u201d Commonwealth v. Cox, 603 Pa. 223, 983 A.2d 666, 685 (2009) (quoting Commonwealth v. Tedford, 598 Pa. 639, 960 A.2d 1, 29 (2008)). \u201cTo constitute a due process violation, the prosecutorial misconduct must be of sufficient significance to result in the denial of the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d Id. at 685 (quoting Greer v. Miller, 483 U.S. 756, 765, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted)). \u201cThe touchstone is fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d Id.\nWe further reiterate that a \u201cprosecutor has reasonable latitude during his closing argument to advocate his case, respond to arguments of opposing counsel, and fairly present the Commonwealth\u2019s version of the evidence to the jury.\u201d Id. at 687. The court must evaluate a prosecutor\u2019s challenged statement in the context in which it was made. Id. Finally, \u201c[n]ot every intemperate or improper remark mandates the granting of a new trial;\u201d id., \u201c[r]eversible error occurs only when the unavoidable effect of the challenged comments would prejudice the jurors and form in their minds a fixed bias and hostility toward the defendant such that the jurors could not weigh the evidence and render a true verdict.\u201d Id.\nA. DNA Evidence\nThe first instance of alleged prosecutorial misconduct involves the prosecutor\u2019s description of a stipulation entered into by the parties regarding the proffered testimony of a Philadelphia Crime Lab technician who examined two ski hats found at the crime scene, but found no DNA evidence that could be conclusively matched to any individual. See N.T. 3/5/2001 at 135-137. As background information relating to this claim, we note that in his summation to the jury, trial counsel emphasized the absence of DNA evidence linking Appellant to the crime. Specifically, trial counsel suggested that to determine whose hat was found at the scene, the Commonwealth could have done more than present McCants\u2019 testimony identifying one of the hats as belonging to Appellant; it could have had the hats analyzed. N.T. 3/6/2001 at 9. Trial counsel urged the jury to question this lack of DNA evidence in its deliberations. See id. at 9-10.\nIn response, the prosecutor stated, in relevant part, as follows:\nI will address one point right away. Perhaps the only mistake that we made in this case, or one of the mistakes that we made in this case, is that we didn\u2019t put the lab person on from the Criminalistics Laboratory.\nCounsel tells you that we didn\u2019t test the physical evidence in this case, but there was a stipulation in this case that those hats, which were taken from the scene, were taken to the Philadelphia Criminalistics Laboratory, and tested by DNA analysis [...].\nThe laboratory technician tested the hat, tested a hair that was in the hat, that was found in the hat, and on neither of those two items could they develop a DNA pattern that could be compared to anyone.\nThe Commonwealth did not fail to compare the Defendant\u2019s DNA to that hat. It was impossible, based on scientific evidence. There was nothing to compare it to. There was no DNA that could be developed.\nId. at 19-20 (emphasis added).\nAppellant argues that these comments constituted prosecutorial misconduct to which trial counsel should have objected. The statements exceeded the fair bounds of the record, he asserts, because the stipulation only provided that the Commonwealth\u2019s expert was unable to retrieve a DNA sample, and not that it was \u201cscientifically impossible\u201d to do so. Appellant further challenges the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the lab technician\u2019s testimony would support such view. Thus, he concludes there is arguable merit to his ineffectiveness claim.\nIn a global argument relating to all of his several claims alleging ineffectiveness of trial counsel for failing to object to prosecutorial misconduct, Appellant asserts that trial counsel had no reasonable basis for \u201cfailing to object and seek corrective measures from the court.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 67. He submits that no countervailing considerations weighed in favor of allowing the prosecutor\u2019s remarks to go \u201cunchecked.\u201d Id. Concerning the prejudice prong of the ineffectiveness test, Appellant contends that the prosecutor\u2019s arguments bolstered the Commonwealth\u2019s case, misdirected the jury, and unfairly influenced the jury\u2019s assessment of the evidence. He asserts that had trial counsel objected, there is a reasonable likelihood that the trial court would have sustained the objections and cautioned the jury to disregard the improper comments. Appellant concludes that, but for counsel\u2019s inaction in this regard, there is a reasonable likelihood that the outcome of the trial would have been different.\nThe Commonwealth responds that Appellant\u2019s claim lacks arguable merit because the prosecutor\u2019s comments were in fair response to trial counsel\u2019s unwarranted criticism of the Commonwealth for failing to utilize DNA analysis on the hats found at the scene. It asserts that the stipulation clearly established that the hats had, in fact, been analyzed, but that no DNA evidence could be recovered.\nThe PCRA court agreed with the Commonwealth, and held that the claim failed \u201cbecause the complained-of-remarks were proper responses to trial counsel\u2019s summation, which mischaracterized the stipulation to the DNA evidence.\u201d PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 23. The court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s statements indicating that the hats had been analyzed, but that no DNA could be developed, were accurate as they were supported by the record, and were a proper response to trial counsel\u2019s attacks on the DNA evidence in summation. Id. Further, the court noted in the aggregate that, even assuming there was merit to this and the remaining claims of prosecutorial misconduct, Appellant would still not be entitled to relief because the court instructed the jury that the statements of counsel are not evidence. Id. at 28 (citing N.T. 3/6/2001 at 2-3).\nThe PCRA court\u2019s conclusions are supported by the record and are free of legal error. There is no arguable merit to Appellant\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments because the prosecutor did not misstate the stipulation. The prosecutor accurately indicated that the Commonwealth conducted DNA testing, but that no DNA could be developed. Rather, it was trial counsel who misstated the stipulation by suggesting that the Commonwealth did not submit the hats found at the murder scene to DNA analysis. The prosecutor responded fairly by clarifying that DNA testing had been performed, but that insufficient DNA samples were recovered to make conclusive findings. See Commonwealth v. Simpson, 562 Pa. 255, 754 A.2d 1264, 1278 (2000) (recognizing that a prosecutor is permitted, during closing arguments, to make a fair response to misleading statements made by defense counsel).\nB. Detective Mangold\nAppellant next argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the prosecutor, in his summation, vouched improperly for Detective Mangold, and made misstatements of law and fact. As noted above, Detective Man-gold obtained the statement from Wiley implicating Appellant in the shootings, and testified at trial that Wiley gave his statement voluntarily. During closing arguments, trial counsel argued to the jury that Wiley only gave the statement to police to avoid being charged with the murders. N.T. 3/6/2001 at 15-17. In support of the arguable merit prong of his ineffectiveness claim, Appellant contends that the prosecutor responded to his argument inappropriately as follows:\nLet\u2019s talk about what happens after Eric Wiley is transported to Homicide. Well, Detective Mangold \u2014 Counsel makes a big thing about this, Detective Mangold was suspicious that Eric Wiley was involved, and that he thought that he was part of it. Detective Mangold told you quite frankly that he thought that Eric Wiley was part of it. You heard a bit about the statement, and you can understand why he thought that. I will argue to you in a bit about what in the statement leads to that conclusion, but he is someone who\u2014 Detective Mangold is someone who cannot keep that a secret, that he thinks that Eric Wiley may have been involved in this because \u2014 what do we know?\nDetective Mangold has to give Eric Wiley his Miranda Warnings when Eric Wiley starts that interview. Detective Mangold, by law, has to start out basically indicating to Eric Wiley: I am not exactly sure what your participation is, but it is possible that you are a part of this, and I have to give you these Miranda Warnings.\nDetective Mangold has to do that, by law, because if Eric Wiley were to turn around and confess to something, he has to be able to use that and show that he gave his Constitutional Warnings. So, Detective Mangold has to start out, by law, kind of tipping his hand to Eric Wiley: Gee, you are not quite the regular witness that we might have in here who is just on the street, a bystander.\nN.T. 3/6/2001 at 23-24. Appellant submits that trial counsel should have objected to these comments because the prosecutor bolstered Detective Mangold\u2019s testimony by emphasizing his honesty and professionalism, suggested improperly that Wiley was not in custody when he gave his statement implicating Appellant, and misstated the law by indicating that Miranda warnings are necessary under circumstances that arise outside of custodial interrogation.\nIn response, the Commonwealth asserts that Appellant\u2019s claim fails for lack of arguable merit because the challenged remarks have nothing to do with Detective Mangold\u2019s credibility or professionalism, and any possible misstatement of Miranda as applied to Wiley is completely unrelated to Appellant\u2019s guilt. The Commonwealth maintains that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were mere responses to trial counsel\u2019s argument that Wiley\u2019s statement was coerced, and were intended to explain Wiley\u2019s actions, i.e., that he did not immediately implicate Appellant, even though Wiley was specifically informed that he may be a suspect in the instant offenses.\nThe PCRA court agreed with the Commonwealth and denied relief on this claim. The court held that trial counsel had no basis to object because the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted fair argument. Rather than vouching for Detective Mangold\u2019s credibility, the court characterized the prosecutor\u2019s remarks as merely identifying the evidence and inferences from the detective\u2019s testimony. Regarding the prosecutor\u2019s purported misstatement of Miranda law, the PCRA court found this component of the claim to be \u201cfrivolous, as Miranda law was not at issue in this case, and the alleged misstatement could not have prejudiced the jury.\u201d PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 25.\nThe PCRA court\u2019s conclusions in this regard are supported by the record and free of legal error. Upon close examination of the challenged remarks, we find that Appellant\u2019s claim lacks a factual basis as the prosecutor\u2019s comments do not address the trustworthiness of Detective Mangold\u2019s testimony. Asserting that the detective lawfully fulfilled his professional duties during his interrogation of Wiley does not speak to the truthfulness of the detective\u2019s testimony at trial. We further agree that any reference to Miranda law as it applied to Wiley is wholly irrelevant to Appellant\u2019s guilt. As trial counsel had no basis to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments, we deny this claim for lack of arguable merit.\nC. Wiley\u2019s Statement\nAppellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the prosecutor exceeded the bounds of the evidence and vouched for the truthfulness of Wiley\u2019s statement. He relies on the following comments by the prosecutor wherein, Appellant asserts, the prosecutor improperly and repeatedly referred to how Detective Mangold got the \u201ctruth\u201d out of Wiley by using reliable interrogation techniques.\nNow, remember: Eric Wiley has a guilty conscience because he knows that he was out on the street; he knows that he has information about these Murders, but the only power, the only technique that Detective Mangold can use to help Eric Wiley, to get a statement from Eric Wiley, is to try to give Eric Wiley the impression that he, Detective Mangold, has information, because otherwise \u2014 remember: Eric Wiley knows what he knows. He knows that he has information about the Murders. He knows that he talked to the Defendant about planning the Robbery. He knows that he had two conversations with the Defendant about the Robbery, so he has a guilty conscience, but he will not come in there and just start telling the detective everything that he know unless he thinks that the detective has information.\nLet\u2019s put this straight out on the table, ladies and gentlemen: I submit to you that you cannot believe the lies that Erie Wiley told in this courtroom about how that statement took place, and believe Detective Mangold, because Detective Mangold tells you: \u201cI did not suggest any details to Eric Wiley.\u201d\nDetective Mangold is a professional. He wants to tell you how the statement developed, how it developed at each stage. He had to give a little bit, push a little bit; tell him: We have information that is inconsistent with what you are telling us, to try to draw out more truth from Eric Wiley. Perhaps, at the end, it is not quite all of the truth, not all of the truth about what happened that day, but as much truth as Detective Mangold could get. [\u00b6]... ] That is why all of this is preserved in this statement.\nN.T. 3/6/2001 at 24-27.\nThe Commonwealth responds that there is no arguable merit to Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim because a prosecutor may argue issues of credibility where the defendant attacked the credibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s witness. See Commonwealth v. Gwaltney, 497 Pa. 505, 442 A.2d 236, 240 (1982) (holding that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks concerning the credibility of the Commonwealth witness did not warrant reversal where motivated by, and commensurate with, defense attacks on a witness\u2019 credibility). It maintains that in the instant case, the credibility of Wiley\u2019s statement to police was central to the defense and the prosecution. Because the defense argued that Wiley\u2019s statement should not be believed because it was coerced by the police, the Commonwealth maintains that the prosecutor could fairly comment that \u201cpolice had to draw Wiley out, until they eventually elicited the truth.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 58.\nWhile it did not address the particular excerpt cited by Appellant, the PCRA court held that the prosecutor did not improperly vouch for her \"witnesses. PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 25. We agree, and conclude that Appellant is not entitled to relief on this claim. Generally, it is improper for counsel to express an opinion regarding the credibility of a witness. Commonwealth v. Rios, 546 Pa. 271, 684 A.2d 1025, 1034 (1996). \u201cHowever, a prosecutor\u2019s remark regarding the credibility of a witness for the Commonwealth does not constitute reversible error if it is a reasonable response to a prior attack on the credibility of that witness by the defense.\u201d Id. Here, as the Commonwealth cogently noted, the crux of the case was the credibility of Wiley\u2019s statement to police that implicated Appellant in the murders, and trial counsel vigorously argued that such statement was false. The challenged remarks at issue here directly addressed the defense\u2019s attack on Wiley\u2019s statement, and, thus, were permissible. See Commonwealth v. Natividad, 595 Pa. 188, 938 A.2d 310, 324 (2007) (holding that a prosecutor may respond to a defendant\u2019s attacks on a witness\u2019 credibility).\nWe reached a similar result in Rios, where the defendant challenged a Commonwealth witness\u2019 credibility concerning her identification of the defendant as one of the perpetrators of the murder. In response, the prosecutor commented on the identification testimony as follows: \u201cthat\u2019s a mark of the truth. She is not trying to make stuff up to make the case better. She is telling the truth of what she knows.\u201d Rios, 684 A.2d at 1034. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly gave his personal opinion that the identification witness had told the truth, this Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s comments \u201cwere a reasonable response, in both scope and force, to trial counsel\u2019s attack on [the witness\u2019] credibility.\u201d Id. We reach the same conclusion here. Because the prosecutor\u2019s comments were permissible, Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim fails for lack of arguable merit. See Commonwealth v. Small, 980 A.2d at 570 (holding that counsel cannot be ineffective for failing to raise a meritless claim).\nD. Wiley\u2019s Trial Testimony\nAppellant next argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing argument wherein she referred to Wiley\u2019s trial testimony as a \u201clie.\u201d See N.T. 3/6/01 at 30 (wherein the prosecutor states, \u201cthink about some of the other lies that [Wiley] told you.... These are his lies, ladies and gentlemen, I submit to you, and what he chooses to lie about specifically, on the stand, tells you more about the truth of that statement than anything else could ... \u201d). Unlike his previous claim, which alleged that the prosecutor expressed improperly her opinion regarding the credibility of a witness, this claim is based upon the prosecutor\u2019s purported attempt to lessen her burden of proof. Appellant submits that the prosecutor suggested to the jury that Wiley\u2019s trial testimony repudiating his prior statement to police was a lie, and that such lie should serve as proof of the accusations Wiley made against Appellant in his prior statement. He relies on our decision in Commonwealth v. Torres, 564 Pa. 219, 766 A.2d 342 (2001), which held that \u201cdisbelief of a denial does not, taken alone, afford affirmative proof that the denied fact existed so as to satisfy a proponent\u2019s burden of proving that fact.\u201d Id. at 345 (citing Commonwealth v. Graham , 528 Pa. 250, 596 A.2d 1117, 1118 (1991)).\nThe Commonwealth does not respond to this particular component of the claim, possibly because Appellant\u2019s argument consists of only a few sentences in his brief. See Appellant\u2019s Brief at 64. The PCRA court, however, expressly rejected this contention, finding that the prosecutor did not mislead the jury regarding Wiley\u2019s testimony; thus the ineffectiveness claim failed for lack of arguable merit. The court held that our decision in Torres did not render the prosecutor\u2019s reference improper because that case is \u201ceasily distinguishable.\u201d PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 27. The court recognized that Torres did not involve a challenge to a prosecutor\u2019s comment, but rather concerned whether there was sufficient evidence to support a conviction for simple assault where the defendant had asserted a claim of self-defense. It interpreted Torres to hold that a fact-finder\u2019s disbelief of a defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense was not a substitute for the proof the Commonwealth was required to provide to disprove a claim of self defense. PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 27. As such, the PCRA court held that Torres has no application here, where Appellant is challenging the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of Wiley\u2019s trial testimony as \u201clies.\u201d\nThe PCRA court\u2019s conclusion in this regard is sound and free of legal error. We are not persuaded that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Wiley\u2019s trial testimony as a \u201clie\u201d served to lessen the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof. Because the record does not support Appellant\u2019s suggestion in this regard, his ineffectiveness claim fails for lack of a factual basis. The PCRA court properly interpreted our decision in Torres, and found such case to be wholly inapplicable to Appellant\u2019s underlying claim of prosecutorial misconduct. Unlike Torres, the prosecutor in the instant case was not suggesting that disbelief of Wiley\u2019s trial testimony substituted as proof that Appellant committed the instant murders. Rather, the Commonwealth relied on additional independent evidence of record that suggested that Appellant was the perpetrator.\nE. Wiley\u2019s View\nAppellant further challenges trial counsel\u2019s failure to object when the prosecutor allegedly misstated, without support in the record, that Wiley was able to see the crime from McCants\u2019 doorway. He relies on the following remarks:\nEric Wiley does not ever once say to you: I was at the door the way everyone tells you and I just couldn\u2019t see it because of the van. He doesn\u2019t say that because that didn\u2019t happen. It wasn\u2019t blocking his vision [...]. Instead, the only way that he can try and convince you that he didn\u2019t see that shooting is to move himself away from the door.\nRemember, again, that where he is standing is at the top of the steps. He is looking down and across, not only across, and he has the advantage of height, as well, where he is standing in that doorway.\nN.T. 3/6/2001 at 39. Appellant maintains that neither the defense nor the prosecutor ever asked Wiley whether his view was obstructed by the van. Thus, he concludes, the prosecutor went beyond the evidence when she commented that the van parked in front of McCants\u2019 residence did not block Wiley\u2019s view of the shooting.\nThe Commonwealth responds that Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim fails for lack of arguable merit because the prosecutor\u2019s comments constituted a fair response to the defense\u2019s closing argument. It asserts that trial counsel argued that Wiley could not have observed the shooting because a van parked in front of McCants\u2019 residence blocked his view. See N.T. 3/6/2001 at 17 (wherein trial counsel asserted that \u201cthere is no way, unless [Wiley] climbed onto the top of the railing ... that he could have seen over that van ... \u201d). The prosecutor was permitted to respond, the Commonwealth submits, that if Wiley\u2019s disavowal of his statement were true, he could simply have testified that the van had blocked his view, rather than insisting that he had never been near McCants\u2019 doorway at the time of the shooting. It concludes that trial counsel \u201cundoubtedly realized that the prosecutor was merely responding to the argument he had just made, and that an objection, therefore, would be pointless.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 62.\nThe PCRA court agreed with the Commonwealth that the prosecutor made the challenged remark in response to trial counsel\u2019s argument that the van would have obstructed Wiley\u2019s view of the crime. PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 27. The court concluded that this was a reasonable inference from the evidence, and, hence, a proper argument. Once again, we find that the PCRA court\u2019s ruling is supported by the record and free of legal error. Trial counsel argued to the jury that Wiley\u2019s statement to police was false because he could not have witnessed the crime due to the fact that a van obstructed his view from McCants\u2019 doorway. N.T. 3/6/2001 at 17. The prosecutor was, therefore, permitted to emphasize that Wiley did not assert an obstructed view when he was repudiating his statement at Appellant\u2019s trial. See Commonwealth v. Rios, 591 Pa. 583, 920 A.2d 790, 808 (2007) (holding that a prosecutor may make all reasonable inferences that find support in the evidence). As the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not improper, trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to object.\nF. Wiley\u2019s Innocence\nAppellant next argues that the prosecutor improperly assured the jury that Wiley could not have been the killer. He cites the following statement from the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument:\nIf there is one thing that is clear in this case, no matter what the Defense Attorney wants you to believe about Eric Wiley, ladies and gentlemen \u2014 and again, it is for you to decide, but Eric Wiley was in that house at the time that the shots were fired.\nN.T. 3/6/2001 at 36. His entire argument consists of the following statement, \u201calthough the prosecutor insisted that Wiley lied at trial, and even though she acknowledged that the police statement might not truthfully have recounted his own participation, she adamantly assured the jury that Wiley could not have been the killer.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 65.\nThe Commonwealth responds that Appellant\u2019s \u201cbare-bones claim\u201d does not warrant PCRA relief because the prosecutor\u2019s argument was framed by references to evidence that Wiley was in the house when the fatal shots were fired. Accordingly, it maintains, because the challenged comment was a reasonable inference from the evidence, it afforded counsel no basis for objection, and the ineffectiveness claim fails for lack of merit.\nThe PCRA court agreed, and concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s comments that Wiley was inside the house when the shooting occurred were supported by the testimony of McCants, her daughter-in-law who was present in McCants home at the time of the shooting, and Wiley, himself. This claim warrants no further elaboration as the PCRA court\u2019s reasoning in this regard is supported by the record, and is free of legal error. See Rios, 920 A.2d at 808 (permitting a prosecutor to make all reasonable inferences supported by the evidence).\nG. McCants\u2019 Testimony\nAppellant next challenges trial counsel\u2019s failure to object when the prosecutor vouched improperly for the credibility of Commonwealth witness McCants, whose testimony placed Appellant at the scene of the crime and identified items found at the scene as belonging to him. He relies on the following comments:\nDespite the fact that one of the men that she gave up is her nephew [Appellant], and the other is her godson [Wiley], she is telling the police because those two men should not have been killed, and because of that, she goes to the police and gives them the information that she has, not because she likes one family member, or dislikes another, but because it is the truth, and she wants to help in the investigation if she can.\nN.T. 3/6/2001 at 38.\nAppellant also faults trial counsel for failing to object to the following comment of the prosecutor, also relating to McCants\u2019 testimony:\nCatherine McCants\u2019 testimony is consistent with what she said in the statement, and is uncontradicted by Counsel. You saw him waving around those papers, looking at those papers, while she was testifying, and the one thing that he could find that was inconsistent from day one, from January 15th, 1999, to the day that she testified to you was: Wait a minute, you didn\u2019t mention the toilet paper in his hand. She said: I don\u2019t remember that toilet paper anymore.\nIs that why you are going to disbelieve everything else that she says, everything else that she told you since January 15th of 1999?\nN.T. 3/6/2001 at 45. He asserts that the prosecutor unmistakably urged the jury to infer that the remaining contents of the \u201cpapers\u201d in counsel\u2019s hand were consistent with McCants\u2019 testimony. Appellant explains that McCants\u2019 first statements to police placed Wiley outside of McCants\u2019 home at the time the murders occurred, and not inside her residence, which is inconsistent with her trial testimony. Thus, he concludes, the prosecutor made a false inference from the evidence to which trial counsel should have objected.\nThe Commonwealth counters that Appellant\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness lacks arguable merit because the prosecutor\u2019s reference to McCants\u2019 testimony as \u201cthe truth\u201d was in fair response to trial counsel\u2019s argument that McCants was trying to cover up for her godson, Wiley, because she was closer to his family than to Appellant\u2019s family. See N.T. 3/6/2001 at 12 (wherein trial counsel asserted, \u201cI will leave it to you to decide whether or not you are convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Miss McCants, and/or her daughter-in-law, are trying to cover up for Eric Wiley, whom they are close to. I think that you got a bit of Miss McCants\u2019 closeness to that family, versus her closeness to [Appellant\u2019s] family.\u201d).\nRegarding that component of the claim alleging that the prosecutor made a false inference from the evidence, the Commonwealth categorizes Appellant\u2019s contention as \u201cmisguided.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 63. It asserts that the challenged comment accurately pointed out that when trial counsel cross-examined McCants with her preliminary hearing testimony, the only inconsistency he found was that she did not remember Wiley using toilet paper on his injured hand when he came into her house on the night of the murder. N.T. 3/2/2001 at 30 (wherein McCants responds \u201cI don\u2019t remember that part of it,\u201d when trial counsel asked whether she recalled Wiley wrapping toilet paper around his hand, and wiping his face). The Commonwealth maintains that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks constituted fair comment on the evidence, and that Appellant\u2019s \u201cfanciful complaint\u201d that the prosecutor was arguing non-record consistent statements is \u201cflatly belied by the record.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 64.\nThe PCRA court rejected Appellant\u2019s contention that the prosecutor vouched improperly for McCants\u2019 testimony when she stated that McCants gave police information that was the truth. It found that \u201cthere is nothing improper about this statement, as it was firmly based on the evidence.\u201d PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 26. It went on to conclude that the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s argument was a fair response to defense counsel\u2019s suggestion that Ms. McCants was covering up for her godson, Mr. Wiley, because she favored him over [Appellant\u2019s] family.\u201d Id. (citing N.T. 3/6/2001 at 12). The PCRA court did not specifically address that component of Appellant\u2019s claim alleging that trial counsel should have objected when the prosecutor referred improperly to non-record consistent statements of McCants.\nUpon review, we conclude that the PCRA court\u2019s conclusions are supported by the record and free of legal error. Trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the \u201ctruth\u201d of McCants\u2019 reports to police because such reference was in direct response to trial counsel\u2019s attack upon the credibility of McCants\u2019 testimony as biased towards Wiley and against Appellant. N.T. 3/6/2001 at 12. Thus, the PCRA court properly held that the comment constituted fair response. Rios, 684 A.2d at 1034. Moreover, the record supports the Commonwealth\u2019s position that the prosecutor\u2019s comments addressing the cross-examination of McCants noted the only minor discrepancy between McCants\u2019 preliminary hearing and trial testimony, and did not assert that her testimony was consistent with any non-record statements. Thus, this portion of Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim fails for lack of a factual predicate.\nH. IMisstatement of Robbery Law\nFinally, Appellant contends that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the prosecutor misleadingly suggested to the jury that any robber who possessed a gun necessarily intends to kill. He cites the following remarks:\nThere are many ways to do a Robbery. You can do a Robbery by putting your hand in your pocket and pretending that you have a gun, and you say: Your money or your life, basically, and people are afraid of that. That is the threat of violence, even though it is not really violent, and they give you their money.\nYou can use a wax gun, or a play gun, but Robbery is something else altogether, I submit to you ladies and gentlemen, when you go out there with a loaded gun, because when you are using a toy gun, or you are using your finger, you are saying basically: The risk I run if I rob someone who has a gun is that they kill me if I can\u2019t run away fast enough, but when you go out there, ladies and gentlemen, with a loaded gun in your hand, to rob someone on the street, what you are saying, by your actions, I submit to you, is: If there is any resistance, I am not the one who is going to go. The person I am robbing is the person who will be killed.\nI read somewhere once that every Robbery is a potential Homicide case, a potential First Degree Murder case, and that\u2019s why, because when you make the decision, as a robber \u2014 when this Defendant made that decision, on January 15th, to take that gun with him, to rob Milton Wise and Rodney Walters, he made the decision that if there was any resistance, he would use the gun, and they would die, that they would be the ones taking the risk, not him.\nN.T. 3/6/2001 at 47-48. Appellant argues, without citation to any authority, that trial counsel should have lodged an objection to these comments because they had no basis in the record and were inflammatory and misleading.\nThe Commonwealth responds that this claim fails for lack of a factual predicate because the prosecutor did not suggest that a robber who possessed a gun necessarily committed the crime with an intent to kill. Rather, it asserts, the prosecutor suggested that because Appellant armed himself with a loaded gun before committing the robberies, he was prepared to kill, rather than be killed, if something went wrong. The Commonwealth maintains that this was a reasonable inference from the evidence establishing that as Appellant tried to rob Wise, Walters intervened and Appellant fatally shot both men. It concludes that because the prosecutor was entitled to argue that the evidence established a material element of the crimes, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object. See Commonwealth v. Smith, 490 Pa. 380, 416 A.2d 986, 989 (1980) (holding that a prosecutor may always argue that the evidence establishes the defendant\u2019s guilt).\nThe PCRA court did not address this particular component of Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim in its opinion. We agree with the Commonwealth, however, that the prosecutor did not suggest to the jury that one who commits a robbery with a firearm does so with the specific intent to kill. We reach this conclusion by examining both the substance and context of the prosecutor\u2019s statement. The challenged remarks were made immediately following the prosecutor\u2019s description of the elements of robbery, one of which involves the use or threat of force. See N.T. 3/6/2001 at 47. The comments had nothing to do with the specific intent to kill that is a requisite for first degree murder. We further agree with the Commonwealth that the prosecutor inferred from the evidence that because Appellant armed himself before robbing the victims, and ultimately shot them when Walters attempted to intervene in the robbery, he used the requisite force necessary for a robbery conviction. Under these circumstances, Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim fails for lack of arguable merit.\nX. Ineffectiveness for Failing to Raise a Batson Challenge\nAppellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the prosecutor exercised her peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner in violation of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). Before addressing the various components of Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim, we review the relevant legal principles in order to place his contentions in context.\nIn Batson, the United States Supreme Court held that a prosecutor\u2019s challenge of potential jurors solely on account of their race violates the Equal Protection Clause. 476 U.S. at 89, 106 S.Ct. 1712. The High Court set forth a three-part test for examining a criminal defendant\u2019s claim that a prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner. Commonwealth v. Ligons, 601 Pa. 103, 971 A.2d 1125, 1142 (2009); Batson, 476 U.S. at 97, 106 S.Ct. 1712. First, the defendant must make a prima facie showing that the circumstances give rise to an inference that the prosecutor struck one or more prospective jurors on account of race. Id. Second, if the prima facie showing is made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a race-neutral explanation for striking the juror(s) at issue. Id. Third, the trial court, which observed the prosecutor\u2019s demeanor during voir dire, then makes the ultimate determination of whether the defense has carried its burden of proving purposeful discrimination. Id.\nTo satisfy the first requirement of demonstrating a prima facie Batson claim, we have held that, generally, the defendant must establish that he is a member of a cognizable racial group, that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to strike members of his race from the venire, and that other relevant circumstances combine to raise an inference that the prosecutor removed the jurors for racial reasons. Ligons, 971 A.2d at 1142; Batson, 476 U.S. at 96, 106 S.Ct. 1712.\nSignificant to the instant case, however, in cases where no Batson challenge was raised during the voir dire process, \u201ca post-conviction petitioner is not entitled to the benefit of Batson\u2019s burden-shifting formula, but instead, bears the burden in the first instance and throughout of establishing actual, purposeful discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Ligons, 971 A.2d at 1142 (citing Commonwealth v. Uderra, 580 Pa. 492, 862 A.2d 74, 86 (2004)). We explained in Uderra that \u201cBatson\u2019s burden-shifting formula makes sense when applied to an objection raised sufficiently promptly that the attorney exercising the challenges can reasonably be expected to remember the reasons for the challenge. On the other hand, it would be altogether unreasonable to shift the burden of explanation if the objection is so tardily made that the challenging attorney cannot be reasonably expected to remember.\u201d Uderra, 862 A.2d at 86 (citing McCrory v. Henderson, 82 F.3d 1243, 1251 (2d Cir.1996)).\nMoreover, under circumstances where the defendant did not lodge an objection to the prosecutor\u2019s exercise of peremptory strikes during voir dire, this Court has generally required the defendant to present a record identifying the race of the venirepersons stricken by the Commonwealth, the race of the prospective jurors acceptable to the Commonwealth but stricken by the defense, and the racial composition of the final jury selected. Commonwealth v. Spence, 534 Pa. 233, 627 A.2d 1176, 1182-83 (1993). With this context in mind, we now turn to our discussion of Appellant\u2019s claim.\nAppellant, who is African American, argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the prosecutor employed her peremptory challenges in a discriminatory manner to strike African American venirepersons without justification. Relating to the arguable merit prong of his ineffectiveness claim, he contends that a prima facie case of discrimination exists under Batson based on: (1) the prosecutor\u2019s use of peremptory strikes to eliminate 46.7% (7 out of 15) of the African American prospective jurors, while striking only 31.8% (7 out of 22) of the non-African American prospective jurors; and, (2) the general \u201cculture of discrimination\u201d in jury selection in the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office. As evidence of the \u201cculture of discrimination,\u201d Appellant relies on: a training videotape advocating discrimination in jury selection made by former Philadelphia prosecutor Jack McMahon; notes taken during a 1990 training lecture given by Bruce Sagel, which urged Philadelphia prosecutors to use racial stereotypes in jury selection; the historical practice of overall juror strike rates in Philadelphia from 1980 through 1999, and the strike rates of Appellant\u2019s prosecutor in other cases unrelated to the instant case. He argues that he should have been afforded an evidentiary hearing to develop a record on these points.\nAs to the reasonable basis prong of the ineffectiveness test, Appellant submits that counsel \u201ccould have no reasonable strategy for failing to make the appropriate objections and attempt to minimize the prejudicial effects of the prosecution\u2019s racially biased use of peremptory strikes.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 75. Finally, Appellant contends that he need not demonstrate prejudice as a Batson violation \u201cis structural error; thus, with proof that a Batson violation occurred, counsel\u2019s error in failing to make appropriate objections must likewise be presumptively prejudicial.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 75.\nThe Commonwealth responds that Appellant\u2019s claim \u201cis so absolutely refuted by the record as to be frivolous.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 65. First, it asserts that Appellant has failed to make a proper record identifying the race of the venirepersons struck by the Commonwealth, the race of the prospective jurors acceptable to the Commonwealth but stricken by the defense, and the racial composition of the final jury, as required by this Court\u2019s decision in Spence. Based on this ground alone, the Commonwealth submits, Appellant\u2019s claim should be rejected. See Commonwealth v. Baez, 554 Pa. 66, 720 A.2d 711, 736 (1999) (rejecting Batson claim because the defendant did not meet the threshold requirement of developing the record of the race of prospective jurors acceptable to the Commonwealth, but stricken by the defense, and the racial composition of final jury).\nSecond, the Commonwealth maintains that Appellant has failed to satisfy his burden of proving his claim. It reiterates that, pursuant to Uderra, a PCRA petitioner challenging trial counsel\u2019s failure to lodge a Batson objection during voir dire must prove actual, purposeful discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth asserts, Appellant only purports to allege a prima facie case of discrimination, which standard has no application on collateral review where a PCRA petitioner does not have the benefit of Batson\u2019s burden-shifting formula.\nThird, the Commonwealth refutes Appellant\u2019s reliance on the prosecutor\u2019s strike rate and the alleged \u201cculture of discrimination.\u201d It emphasizes that the actual jury chosen consisted of six African Americans, five Caucasians, and one individual who identified his race as \u201cother.\u201d Thus, half of the jury consisted of individuals who shared the same race as Appellant. The Commonwealth submits that this strongly refutes any notion of racial discrimination in jury selection. Even assuming the prosecutor struck more African Americans than Caucasians (46.7% versus 31.8%), the Commonwealth argues that this fact is inadequate to demonstrate purposeful discrimination.\nLikewise, the Commonwealth maintains, Appellant\u2019s proffer of a \u201cculture of discrimination\u201d in the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office does nothing to advance his Batson claim because the individual assertions in support thereof have no relevance to the selection of Appellant\u2019s jury. For this reason, it submits, this Court has routinely rejected similar claims. Specifically, the Commonwealth submits, neither the training videotape prepared by former prosecutor Jack McMahon nor the 1990 lecture given by Bruce Sagel have any relevance because those individuals did not try Appellant\u2019s case. See e.g. Commonwealth v. Rollins, 558 Pa. 532, 738 A.2d 435, 443 n. 10 (1999) (holding that the mere existence of the McMahon tape does not demonstrate that there was discrimination in the selection of the defendant\u2019s jury). The Commonwealth also discounts Appellant\u2019s reliance on the \u201chistorical practice\u201d of overall jury strikes by Philadelphia prosecutors, as well as Appellant\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s alleged strike rates in six cases unrelated to the instant case. It characterizes Appellant\u2019s purported findings as suspect and irrelevant to whether the prosecutor engaged in discrimination in the instant case. As the underlying Batson claim lacks arguable merit, the Commonwealth concludes that trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to raise it.\nThe PCRA court similarly rejected Appellant\u2019s claim. First, it found that Appellant failed to identify and make a record of the race of the specific venirepersons stricken by the Commonwealth, the race of those found acceptable to the Commonwealth, but stricken by the defense, and the racial composition of the final jury. As it was Appellant\u2019s burden to do so, the court concluded that his underlying Batson claim failed. PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 30. Second, it rejected Appellant\u2019s reliance on the prosecutor\u2019s strike rate in the instant case, holding that \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s proffer indicates that she accepted 8 of 15 African American venirepersons as jurors, and the final jury was made up of six African Americans, one who identified himself as \u2018other,\u2019 and five whites.\u201d Id. Third, the court further rejected Appellant\u2019s suggestion that a \u201csystematic discriminatory policy\u201d employed by the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office evinced a prima fade case that the prosecutor engaged in purposeful racial discrimination. Id. It found that Appellant\u2019s assertions were irrelevant and concluded that he \u201cfailed to show how allegedly discriminatory trends affected jury selection in this case, particularly since the jury composition was 50% African American, and the prosecutor accepted more than half of the eligible African American venirepersons.\u201d Id. at 31 (citing Commonwealth v. Williams, 581 Pa. 57, 863 A.2d 505, 523 (2004) (rejecting a claim of racial discrimination that relied on similar evidence where defendant showed no links between such evidence and his particular case)).\nUpon careful review, we find that the PCRA court\u2019s conclusions are supported by the record and free of legal error. For purposes of argument, we assume that Appellant satisfied his burden under Spence to develop properly a record in support of his Batson claim. Nevertheless, in a case such as this where trial counsel did not lodge a contemporaneous Batson objection during voir dire, Appellant is not entitled to the benefit of Batson\u2019s burden-shifting formula and must demonstrate actual purposeful discrimination by a preponderance of the evidence. Uderra, 862 A.2d at 86. The only evidence proffered that relates to the empanelling of Appellant\u2019s particular jury is the fact that the prosecutor peremptorily struck more African Americans than Caucasians. This fact, absent any other evidence of discrimination, is insufficient to demonstrate purposeful discrimination. See Ligons, 971 A.2d at 1125 (holding that the prosecutor\u2019s striking of more African Americans than Caucasians, in and of itself, is insufficient to demonstrate purposeful discrimination). Considering the totality of the circumstances, we do not find the slight disparity in exercise of peremptory strikes to be such as to indicate racial discrimination. As emphasized by the Commonwealth and the PCRA court, half of the jurors ultimately chosen shared the same race as Appellant. See Commonwealth v. Cook, 597 Pa. 572, 952 A.2d 594, 608 (2008) (holding that the racial composition of the jury, the race of the victim, and the race of the defendant serve as circumstantial evidence relevant to evaluation of a Batson claim). Further, Appellant has not pointed to any .comments made by the prosecutor during voir dire that would suggest that the prosecutor was racially biased, nor has Appellant demonstrated that this case was racially sensitive. See Ligons, 971 A.2d at 1144 (in rejecting an underlying Batson claim, the court noted that the record did not contain any questionable remarks made during jury selection that would suggest a motive to discriminate based on race; nor was the case racially sensitive as the appellant and the victim shared the same race); Commonwealth v. Spotz, 587 Pa. 1, 896 A.2d 1191, 1213-14 (2006) (holding that when evaluating a Batson claim alleging gender discrimination, a court may look to whether the prosecutor made any questionable remarks during jury selection).\nFinally, we concur in the PCRA court\u2019s finding that, even if believed, Appellant\u2019s general claim of a \u201cculture of discrimination\u201d in the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office is inadequate to demonstrate purposeful discrimination in the selection of his particular jury. See Ligons, 971 A.2d at 1145 (holding that \u201cAppellant\u2019s blanket claim of a \u2018culture of discrimination\u2019 in the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office is insufficient to demonstrate purposeful discrimination as the various assertions do not involve the prosecutor who selected Appellant\u2019s jury and have no connection to his individual case\u201d). The existence of the McMahon tape, in which then-prosecutor Jack McMahon set forth his discriminatory views on jury selection, is irrelevant because McMahon was not the prosecutor at Appellant\u2019s trial. See Commonwealth v. Marshall, 596 Pa. 587, 947 A.2d 714, 722 (2008) (condemning the discriminatory practices advocated in the McMahon videotape, but holding that the tape does not establish a policy of racial discrimination in jury selection, and does not suggest discrimination in cases where McMahon did not prosecute). Likewise we have expressly rejected any reliance on notes from the 1990 Sagel lecture as establishing a policy of racial discrimination in jury selection where there is no link between the lecture and the case at hand. Id. Finally, we reject Appellant\u2019s reliance on statistical findings relating to the \u201chistorical strike rate\u201d of both the Philadelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office and the particular prosecutor in this case. Even assuming, for purposes of argument, that such statistics are accurate, they simply do not suffice to satisfy Appellant\u2019s burden of proving actual purposeful discrimination under the facts presented. As trial counsel had no basis to make a Batson challenge during voir dire, he cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to do so.\nAccordingly, we likewise conclude that Appellant was not entitled to an evidentiary hearing on this claim. Appellant has not raised any issues of material fact, which, if believed, would entitle him to relief. Additionally, no purpose would be served by any further evidentiary proceedings on this issue. Thus, the PCRA court did not abuse its discretion by denying his request for an evidentiary hearing.\nXI. Ineffectiveness for Failing to Object to Jury Charge on Intent to Kill\nAppellant next argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the trial court informed the jury that it was permitted to infer specific intent to kill from the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body. In support of the arguable merit component of his ineffectiveness claim, he contends that this instruction created an impermissible presumption of guilt, and relieved the Commonwealth of its burden of proving first degree murder. Appellant asserts that the charge violated his constitutional right to due process because it urged the jury to infer an essential element of first degree murder (the specific intent to kill) from another (the act of killing).\nAlternatively, he submits that even assuming the challenged instruction generally does not violate due process, its use in this case did so. Appellant contends that the jury could not have rationally concluded from the evidence that he possessed the specific intent to kill merely because he fired his weapon into a vital part of the victim\u2019s body. Rather, he asserts, the shots could have been fired accidentally during a robbery attempt, and without the specific intent to kill. He concludes that because the jury could not rationally infer from the circumstances of the robbery that he had the specific intent to kill, the trial court\u2019s instruction that the jury may rely on such inference violated the Fourteenth Amendment, and trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object.\nAs to the reasonable basis prong of the ineffectiveness test, Appellant argues that trial counsel had an obligation to object to erroneous jury instructions, particularly when they shifted the burden to the defense to disprove the key element of first degree murder. He asserts that \u201c[t]here could be no reasonable strategic purpose behind counsel\u2019s failure to ensure, before the charge began, that the trial court would not give this instruction, or to object to the charge and seek appropriate curative measures once it did.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 87. Finally, Appellant contends that trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the jury charge prejudiced him. Had trial counsel objected to the jury instruction, he submits, there is a reasonable likelihood that the court would have omitted the charge, which would have precluded the jury from basing its verdict on the impermissible presumption.\nThe Commonwealth responds that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object when the trial court instructed the jury that specific intent to kill may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body. It argues that Appellant\u2019s claim lacks arguable merit because this Court has routinely rejected similar challenges. See Commonwealth v. Murphy, 559 Pa. 71, 739 A.2d 141, 150 (1999) (rejecting Appellant\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the charge informing the jury that it could infer malice from the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim\u2019s body because such instruction is \u201cconsistent with longstanding jurisprudence of this Court\u201d); Commonwealth v. Ly, 528 Pa. 523, 599 A.2d 613, 619 (1991) (holding that \u201cthe instructions that the jury could infer malice or intent to kill from the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body was proper and does not shift the burden of production to the defendant\u201d). Contrary to Appellant\u2019s assertion, the Commonwealth submits, the challenged jury instruction did not lessen its burden of proof, but rather permitted the jury to draw the logical inference that firing a gun into a vital part of the victim\u2019s body is circumstantial evidence that the shooter intended to kill the victim. Emphasizing that the jury was free to reject the inference, the Commonwealth maintains that the instruction was proper and did not serve as a basis for trial counsel to lodge an objection. See Commonwealth v. O\u2019Searo, 466 Pa. 224, 352 A.2d 30, 36-37 (1976) (rejecting challenge to instruction that the jury could infer malice or intent to kill from the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the body and holding that the inference arising from the instruction is permissive, allowing the jury to either accept or reject it based on the attendant circumstances).\nThe PCRA court rejected Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim as lacking arguable merit. It held that the challenged jury charge was \u201centirely proper, and did not relieve the Commonwealth of its burden of proving any element of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 21. The court explained that the instruction merely permitted the jury to draw the inference of specific intent to kill from Appellant\u2019s use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim\u2019s body. Id. It emphasized that \u201c[t]his permissive instruction by no means required that the jury make such an inference \u2014 they were free not to infer specific intent to kill.\u201d Id. The court further noted that the instruction was consistent with established case law that a jury may infer specific intent to kill from the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body. See Commonwealth v. Spotz, 552 Pa. 499, 716 A.2d 580, 583 (1998) (holding that \u201ca specific intent to kill may be proven by circumstantial evidence, and therefore, may be inferred from the defendant\u2019s use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the victim\u2019s body\u201d).\nThe PCRA court\u2019s conclusions are supported by the record and free of legal error. This Court rejected arguments identical to those currently raised by Appellant in Commonwealth v. Washington, 592 Pa. 698, 927 A.2d 586 (2007), where we held that an instruction permitting the jury to infer the specific intent to kill from the appellant\u2019s use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim\u2019s body was in accordance with the law, and that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object. Id. at 608. We reach the same conclusion here. Moreover, we are not persuaded by Appellant\u2019s suggestion that even if the charge is generally valid, it was invalid as given in his case. Contrary to his contention that the charge shifted improperly the burden of proof to him, the charge, when read as a whole, specifically informed the jury that Appellant was presumed innocent, and did not have to prove anything in his defense. N.T. 3/6/2001 at 63; see also Commonwealth v. Pursell, 555 Pa. 233, 724 A.2d 293, 314 (1999) (holding that in addressing challenges to jury instructions, we consider the challenged portions in light of the entire instruction). The charge further explained that only the Commonwealth bears the burden of proving the elements of the offenses charged. See N.T. 3/6/2001 at 63 (wherein the trial court stated \u201cIt is not the Defendant\u2019s burden to prove that he is not guilty. Instead, it is the Commonwealth that always has the burden of proving each and every element of the crimes charged, and that the Defendant is guilty of those crimes, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); see also id. at 64 (wherein the trial court reiterated that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth has the burden of proving the Defendant guilty, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). Accordingly, Appellant\u2019s claim fails for lack of arguable merit.\nXII. Ineffectiveness for Failing to Object to Jury Charge on Third Degree Murder\nWithout citation to authority, Appellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for faffing to object when the trial court defined third degree murder as requiring the absence of the specific intent to kill. Relating to the arguable merit component of his ineffectiveness claim, he contends that this instruction, coupled with the instruction that the jury may infer specific intent to kill from the use of a deadly weapon on a vital part of the body, denied him due process by precluding the jury from finding Appellant guilty of the lesser charge of third degree murder. Considering the dearth of evidence of the specific intent to kill and evidence establishing that a robbery even took place, Appellant maintains, trial counsel should have objected to the erroneous jury charge.\nAs to the second prong of the ineffectiveness test, Appellant submits that \u201c[t]rial counsel had no reasonable strategy for failing to litigate this meritorious claim.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 90. Finally, he contends that he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s omission because the jury was precluded from finding him guilty of third degree murder, and there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different had counsel objected to the erroneous instruction.\nThe Commonwealth counters that Appellant\u2019s claim lacks arguable merit as the challenged instruction on third degree murder was an accurate statement of the law. Contrary to Appellant\u2019s contention, it maintains that the court\u2019s instruction did not \u201cforce\u201d the jury to' convict him of first degree murder, but rather set forth each degree of murder and the possible verdicts as to each victim. The Commonwealth further emphasizes that Appellant offers no legal authority in support of his claim. Because trial counsel had no basis to object to the court\u2019s correct statement of the law, the Commonwealth submits that trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective. See Rios, 920 A.2d at 801 (holding that trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to object to proper jury instructions).\nThe PCRA court summarily rejected Appellant\u2019s claim, finding that \u201c[t]his court\u2019s instruction that third degree murder is a killing without specific intent was an accurate statement of the law.\u201d PCRA Ct. Slip Op. at 22. It further noted that the jury\u2019s finding of second degree murder for the killing of Mr. Walters is proof that the jury was not forced to convict Appellant of first degree murder.\nOnce again, we conclude that the PCRA court\u2019s conclusions are supported by the record and free of legal error. \u201cIt is well-established that third degree murder is distinguishable from first degree murder in that only first degree murder requires the specific intent to kill.\u201d Commonwealth v. Williams, 602 Pa. 360, 980 A.2d 510, 525 (2009); see also 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a) & (c) (defining the various degrees of murder). Thus, the trial court\u2019s charge was proper, and Appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claim fails for lack of arguable merit.\nXIII. Cumulative Error\nAppellant argues that even if we find that he is not entitled to relief based on any particular error, \u201che is nevertheless entitled to relief because the cumulative effect of counsel\u2019s deficiencies, and the accumulated effect of all of the errors.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 91. In response, the Commonwealth argues that \u201cno number of failed claims may collectively attain merit if they could not do so individually.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 76-77 (citing Commonwealth v. Williams, 532 Pa. 265, 615 A.2d 716, 722 (1992)). Thus, it argues, Appellant\u2019s claim of cumulative error fails.\nAs cogently noted by the Commonwealth, this Court has repeatedly held that no number of failed ineffectiveness claims may collectively warrant relief if they fail to do so individually. Commonwealth v. Johnson, 600 Pa. 329, 966 A.2d 523, 532 (2009). Thus, to the extent claims are rejected for lack of arguable merit, there is no basis for an accumulation claim. Commonwealth v. Sattazahn, 597 Pa. 648, 952 A.2d 640, 671 (2008). When the failure of individual claims is grounded in lack of prejudice, however, then the cumulative prejudice from those individual claims may properly be assessed. Johnson, 966 A.2d at 532 (citing Commonwealth v. Perry, 537 Pa. 385, 644 A.2d 705, 709 (1994), for the principle that a new trial may be awarded due to cumulative prejudice accrued through multiple instances of trial counsel\u2019s ineffective representation).\nHere, we have not disposed of any of Appellant\u2019s claims solely on the grounds of lack of prejudice. Thus, we have found no errors from which we can cumulatively assess the prejudice suffered by Appellant. Under these circumstances, Appellant is not entitled to relief.\nXIV. Discovery Requests\nAppellant argues that the PCRA court erred by denying his requests for discovery of ballistics reports and the \u201chomicide file.\u201d As noted, we review the denial of discovery for an abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Collins, 598 Pa. 397, 957 A.2d 237, 272 (2008). Discovery in death penalty collateral proceedings is permissible only upon leave of court, and only for good cause shown. Pa.R.Crim.P. 902(E)(2). \u201c \u2018A showing of good cause requires more than just a generic demand for potentially exculpatory evidence.\u2019 \u201d Collins, 957 A.2d at 272 (quoting Commonwealth v. Bryant, 579 Pa. 119, 855 A.2d 726, 750 (2004)).\nA. Ballistics Reports\nRegarding the ballistics reports, Appellant maintains that he received a copy of only two pages of information pertaining to the bullets retrieved from each of the two victims. He argues that he needed the complete ballistics report, which may have been exculpatory to him, and that the PCRA court abused its discretion in denying discovery. The Commonwealth responds that it provided extensive discovery to Appellant in connection with the PCRA proceedings, and that his request for additional discovery is based entirely on speculation that the requested materials might be exculpatory. See Commonwealth v. Carson, 590 Pa. 501, 913 A.2d 220, 261 (2006) (holding that speculation that requested documents will uncover exculpatory evidence does not satisfy the requirements of Pa.R.Crim.P. 902(E)(2)). It emphasizes that ballistics evidence has never been at issue in this case, and Appellant has failed to provide any basis for his supposition that additional material exists.\nWe agree with the Commonwealth that Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the PCRA court abused its discretion by denying his request for additional discovery relating to ballistics reports that may or may not exist. Appellant has failed to make any showing of good cause why this information, if it existed, would have been exculpatory to him. Under these circumstances, the PCRA court properly denied Appellant\u2019s discovery request.\nB. Homicide File\nAppellant also argues that the PCRA court abused its discretion by denying his request for discovery of the \u201chomicide file.\u201d He alleges that \u201cadditional evidence and information known to the police exculpated him, impeached the credibility of Commonwealth witnesses, and inculpated Wiley.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 93. Appellant fails to elaborate on such \u201cadditional evidence,\u201d but nevertheless maintains that \u201cthere is reason to believe\u201d that the police interrogation of Wiley was \u201caffected by other information police had on hand at the time of the interrogation.\u201d Id. He summarily concludes that \u201c[a]s the Homicide File contains all information pertaining [to] the investigation of the homicides, the lower court erred in failing to order the Commonwealth to provide those materials.\u201d Id.\nThe Commonwealth counters that the PCRA court did not abuse its discretion by denying Appellant\u2019s discovery request. It asserts that Appellant\u2019s conjecture that an opportunity to peruse the entire police homicide file might yield helpful evidence does not constitute good cause. See Abu-Jamal, 720 A.2d at 91 (holding that the PCRA court properly rejected the request for \u201cwholesale discovery of whatever information [the petitioner] \u2018believed\u2019 to exist and/or files so that he could discern whether his assertions were true\u201d).\nWe agree with the Commonwealth that the PCRA court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant\u2019s request for discovery of the homicide file. As with the previous claim, Appellant has not made a showing of good cause as he is unaware whether exculpatory information even exists.\nXV. Conclusion\nFor the reasons stated herein, the order of the PCRA court denying relief is affirmed. Jurisdiction is relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justices EAKIN, TODD, McCAFFERY and ORIE MELVIN, join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\n. The PCRA court granted Appellant a new penalty hearing with the agreement of the Commonwealth. Thus, no penalty phase issues are before us in this appeal.\n. As discussed infra, the hats were tested for DNA, but no conclusive findings were made because of an inability to obtain a sufficient DNA sample.\n. The parties stipulated that when the victims were brought to the hospital, two gold rings, credit cards, and $184 were recovered from Wise's person; $318 was recovered from Walters. N.T. 3/5/ 2001 at 139-40.\n. This Court has jurisdiction over Appellant\u2019s appeal because we directly review the denial of post-conviction relief in death penalty cases pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9546(d).\n. While the Pennsylvania test for ineffectiveness is the same as the performance and prejudice standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), in application, this Court has characterized the test as tripartite, by dividing the performance element into two distinct parts, i.e., arguable merit and lack of reasonable basis. Commonwealth v. Rainey, 593 Pa. 67, 928 A.2d 215, 225 n. 8 (2007).\n. This Court entered its ruling in Grant on December 31, 2002, and Appellant\u2019s direct appeal was filed on August 27, 2003.\n. Nevertheless, Appellant repeatedly challenges appellate counsel's effectiveness for failing to raise each substantive issue on direct appeal. As Appellant's direct appeal was submitted after our decision in Grant, appellate counsel could not have challenged trial counsel's effectiveness on direct appeal, and likewise cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to do so. Thus, further discussion of Appellant's derivative claims of appellate counsel ineffectiveness is unnecessary.\n. To the extent this claim can be construed as raising substantive challenges to Appellant's conviction on due process and Sixth Amendment grounds, these claims are waived as they were never raised on direct appeal. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b) (providing that a PCRA claim is waived \"if the petitioner could have raised it but failed to do so before trial, at trial, during unitary review, on appeal or in a prior state post[-]conviction proceeding\u201d).\n. Appellant further suggests that trial counsel should have made an appropriate objection to the introduction of Wiley's statement at trial, see Appellant\u2019s Brief at 15, and the Commonwealth responds to this contention. We defer discussion of this particular component of the claim until examination of Issue II, which directly implicates counsel\u2019s failure to object to the admission of Wiley\u2019s statement.\n. We offer no opinion on whether due process is violated when a conviction is based solely upon recanted testimony, an issue which is currently pending before our court in Commonwealth v. Brown, 5 EAP 2010, but merely point out the dearth of case law on the topic for purposes of examining the reasonableness of the tactic employed by counsel at the time of trial. Further, unlike the circumstances in Brown, and as emphasized infra, Appellant's conviction was not based solely upon the recanted prior statement of Wiley, but was supported by other evidence.\n. This Court stated on direct appeal:\n[T]he mere fact that Wiley recanted a statement he had previously made to the police certainly does not render the evidence insufficient to support Appellant\u2019s conviction. Rather, the jury was free to evaluate both Wiley\u2019s statement to police as well as his testimony at trial recanting that statement, and free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence. See Commonwealth v. Pitts, 486 Pa. 212, 404 A.2d 1305 (1979) (jury is free to believe all, part or none of the evidence presented). It is not for this Court to reweigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the fact-finder. See Commonwealth v. Gibson, 553 Pa. 648, 720 A.2d 473, 480 (1998) (\"Credibility determinations are strictly within the province of the finder of fact; therefore, an appellate court may not reweigh the evidence and substitute its judgment for that of the finder of fact.\u201d). Moreover, in making his claim, Appellant ignores the additional circumstantial evidence that pointed to him as the killer, including the testimony of several other individuals that placed him at the scene of the crime near the time of the shooting, as well as the fact that his personal effects were found at the crime scene. Thus, Appellant\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to support his first-degree murder conviction fails.\nIn his second claim, Appellant argues that he should be granted a new trial because the verdict was against the weight of the evidence. However, given the evidence as outlined above, including Wiley's statement to police, eyewitness testimony placing Appellant at the crime scene, and the presence of Appellant\u2019s personal effects at the scene, it certainly cannot be said that the jury's verdict shocks one's sense of justice. Commonwealth v. Brown, 538 Pa. 410, 648 A.2d 1177, 1189 (1994) (this Court may only reverse the jury's verdict on the basis that it is against the weight of the evidence if that verdict is \u201cso contrary to the evidence as to shock one\u2019s sense of justice\u201d).\nHanible, 836 A.2d at 39-40.\n. The Confrontation Clause provides that \u201cin all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI.\n. Appellant concedes that Wiley's prior statement would be admissible to impeach Wiley\u2019s trial testimony that he had no knowledge of the murders. He challenges only the admissibility of the statement as substantive evidence of Appellant\u2019s guilt.\n. To the extent this claim can be construed as raising a substantive challenge to Appellant's conviction based on the inadmissibility of Wiley\u2019s statement, this claim is waived as it was not raised on direct appeal. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b).\n. Rule 803.1(1) mirrors our holding in Lively and provides as follows: The following statements, as hereinafter defined, are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant testifies at the trial or hearing and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement:\n(1) Inconsistent statement of witness. A statement by a declarant that is inconsistent with the declarant's testimony, and (a) was given under oath subject to the penalty of perjury at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition, or (b) is a writing signed and adopted by the declarant, or (c) is a verbatim contemporaneous recording of an oral statement.\nPa.R.E. 803.1(1).\n. Only the second alternative for demonstrating admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement is at issue here because Wiley\u2019s statement was neither made under oath at a formal proceeding nor recorded.\n. Moreover, the Commonwealth asserts there is no factual basis for this claim of ineffectiveness because trial counsel did, in fact, object to the prosecutor's use of Wiley's statement on the grounds that \"[h]e hasn't adopted this,\u201d N.T. 3/5/2001 at 23, but such objection was, not surprisingly, unsuccessful.\n. Andrea Wilson\u2019s declaration did not mention a van being parked in front of McCants' residence.\n. To be precise, the Commonwealth explains that while the murder and robbery charges against Wiley were dismissed, he was held for trial on aggravated assault charges, but was acquitted on December 16, 1999, prior to Appellant\u2019s trial.\n. The Commonwealth asserts that Appellant abandoned on appeal his claim as it relates to his juvenile adjudication for theft because he sets forth no argument whatsoever concerning that component of the claim.\n. In fact, Wiley was not charged with the \"pending\u201d criminal offenses until March, 15, 1999, nearly two months after Wiley gave his statement to police.\n. While Appellant implies that any failure to prove his claim is the result of the PCRA court\u2019s refusal to grant discovery of the voluminous police records relating to Wiley's enumerated criminal charges, he fails to explain why PCRA counsel could not have obtained a declaration from Wiley or Detective Mangold, the primary individuals who could confirm or deny such an allegation, to determine whether Wiley\u2019s previous criminal proceedings served as an impetus for garnering Wiley\u2019s statement against Appellant.\n. In a related claim, Appellant argues that the Commonwealth violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), when it failed to turn over to trial counsel evidence relating to Wiley\u2019s previous criminal charges, as discussed in this issue, and the purported immunity agreement, which we have concluded was never executed. Under Brady, the prosecution\u2019s failure to divulge exculpatory evidence is a violation of a defendant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment due process rights. \u201d[T]o establish a Brady violation, a defendant is required to demonstrate that exculpatory or impeaching evidence, favorable to the defense, was suppressed by the prosecution, to the prejudice of the defendant.\u201d Commonwealth v. Gibson, 597 Pa. 402, 951 A.2d 1110, 1126 (2008). We reject Appellant's Brady claim in this regard because he has failed to demonstrate that evidence of Wiley\u2019s criminal charges would have served as exculpatory and/or impeachment evidence, considering that Wiley testified in favor of Appellant at trial. Likewise, as noted, Appellant has failed to demonstrate that the purportedly withheld evidence would have served to discredit Wiley\u2019s statement to police, without adversely affecting his trial testimony in favor of Appellant.\n. The police reports refer to McCants as Catherine Newsuan, as that was the surname she used at that time.\n. Again, Appellant did not learn that it was Wilson\u2019s voice in the background of the 911 call until after the PCRA proceedings had concluded in the trial court.\n. In a related claim, Appellant argues that the Commonwealth violated Brady when it failed to turn over to trial counsel the 911 audiotape. As noted, to succeed on a Brady claim, \"a defendant is required to demonstrate that exculpatory or impeaching evidence, favorable to the defense, was suppressed by the prosecution, to the prejudice of the defendant.\u201d Gibson, 951 A.2d at 1126. We summarily reject Appellant's Brady claim because he has failed to demonstrate that the 911 audiotape was exculpatory to him, or that the Commonwealth suppressed it.\n. In a related claim, Appellant argues that the Commonwealth violated Brady by withholding evidence of McCants\u2019 prior contacts with the police. We summarily deny this claim as Appellant has failed to demonstrate the Commonwealth suppressed the evidence at issue. See Gibson, 951 A.2d at 1126 (holding that to succeed on a Brady claim \"a defendant is required to demonstrate that exculpatory or impeaching evidence, favorable to the defense, was suppressed by the prosecution, to the prejudice of the defendant\u201d). We note that McCants provided an affidavit for this PCRA hearing and presumably could have informed Appellant's counsel, had she been asked, about the previous cases in which she testified for the Commonwealth.\n. As noted above, the testimony of Detective Mangold, who obtained Wiley\u2019s statement implicating Appellant in the murders, was offered to refute Wiley\u2019s trial testimony that his statement was coerced, and to demonstrate that Wiley's statement was given voluntarily and without threat of physical harm.\n. The stipulation the prosecutor read to the jury at trial, which was confirmed by trial counsel on the record, stated:\nMr. [Kevin] Knox [a Criminalistics Technician with the Philadelphia Crime Lab] would testify that he tested portions of the hat, the solid black hat, and that he could not get areas of perspiration that he thought would check positive for DNA, because \u2014 that is contained in fluids in the body, and he could not get any DNA samples from the hat that he tested to compare it to anybody, and no results were found.\nHe would say that he tested a hair fragment from the same knit hat, but that the hair fragment had no root on it, and again, he was unable to get any sample from that hair fragment to use and contrast with anybody else.\nThere were no DNA samples taken from that hair, or from that hat.\nWith respect to Hat Number-2, there was an area of possible perspiration that he cut out, that he took, and he would say that there are six possible matches that they can make, when comparing DNA. He got three of those six from his test, and based on that, he would say that he cannot \u2014 the way that he would put it is that he cannot exclude Milton Wise [the victim] as the person who deposited the perspiration on the hat because three of his six are a match, but not all. So, you cannot exclude Mr. Wise, but the three that he got were a match.\nThere was also a hair, a light brown hair, with a root, again, from that same hat with the Reebok on it, and that he got two of the six tests from that, but again, he could not exclude Milton Wise as the person who deposited that hair on there, based on his comparison. N.T. 3/5/01 at 135-37.\n. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).\n. The Crimes Code provides that a person is guilty of robbery if, in the course of committing a theft, he, inter alia, inflicts serious bodily injury upon another or threatens another with or intentionally puts him in fear of immediate serious bodily injury. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701(a)(l)(i), (ii).\n. To the extent this claim can be construed as raising a substantive Batson claim, it is waived because Appellant failed to preserve the issue during voir dire. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b) (providing that a PCRA claim is waived \"if the petitioner could have raised it but failed to do so before trial, at trial, during unitary review, on appeal or in a prior state postconviction proceeding\u201d).\n. In support of this assertion, Appellant offers statistics he has compiled after examining cases eligible for the death penalty based on information purportedly obtained from the Administrative Office of Pennsylvania Courts\u2019 database. He maintains that from 1980 though 1999, Philadelphia prosecutors struck African American prospective jurors at a rate of 55%, while they struck non-African American prospective jurors at a rate of 22%.\n. Specifically, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:\nIn addition, if you believe that the Defendant intentionally used a deadly weapon on a vital part of the victim\u2019s body, you may regard that as an item of circumstantial evidence from which you may infer that the Defendant had the specific intent to kill.\nN.T. 3/6/2001 at 73.\n. Additionally, we reject Appellant\u2019s contention that he is entitled to a hearing on this meritless claim that raises no genuine issues of material fact. No purpose would be served by further proceedings on this issue.\n. The trial court\u2019s charge on third degree murder provided as follows:\nNow, Murder in the Third Degree. Murder in the Third Degree is an unlawful killing of a human being, with malice; that is, with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, but not necessarily an intention to take human life, and yet, as a result of the infliction of the injury, death occurs.\nIn other words, Third Degree Murder includes any unlawful killing of a human being, with malice, but where no intention to kill exists, or can reasonably and fully be inferred.\nThus, if there is an unlawful killing, where there is a wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequences, and a mind regardless of social duty, but if no intention to kill can be inferred or collected from the facts, then the verdict should be guilty of Murder in the Third Degree.\nMalice, in Murder in the Third Degree, is the malicious design to do harm, but not to kill.\nTherefore, in order to find the Defendant guilty of Third Degree Murder, you must find that the Defendant unlawfully took the life of the victim, with malice of forethought, with no specific intent to kill, but with an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm, yet, as a result of the inflicting of the injury, death occurs.\nI remind you: If you find that the killing was with no intention to kill, but only to inflict grievous bodily harm, while it would ordinarily be Third Degree Murder, if you find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that it occurred in the commission of a Felony, it would be Second Degree Murder.\nN.T. 3/6/2001 at 76-77.\n. Our resolution of Issue I, regarding whether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge Appellant\u2019s conviction on due process grounds, noted only as an alternative ground that Appellant was not prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s omission.\n. Appellant further argues that the PCRA court erred by failing to grant him an evidentiary hearing. We have already rejected this claim in connection with the various issues in which such allegations were made.\n. The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court is directed to transmit the complete record of this case to the Governor pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711 (i)."}
