{"id": "842368", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Thompson,\nThe question raised in this appeal is whether the legacies in the will of John Gilmor deceased lapse. John Gilmor, the testator, died November 30, 1889, unmarried, leaving surviving him an unmarried sister, who died February 21, 1891. He made his will August 18, 1883, and on September 21, 1888, adding a codicil, then republished it. By his will before this republication he gave to his sister Eliza the income of his estate during her natural life, and upon her death directed his executors to convert the estate into money, and devised it to the following named persons, who were each to receive one share, viz.: David M. Gilmor, Mary E. Ahl, Nannie Herr, Lydia B. Wilson, William Gilmor, Samuel Dorrance, James Dorrance, Senior, William Dorrance, Eliza Robinson, Martha A. McClellan, Samuel P. Cummings and William B. Cummings.\nThe auditor appointed to make distribution finds \u201c that the only codicil is dated September 21, 1888, and in the latter part of the summer of 1889 Mr. Hastings Gehr and George McDowell visited testator, who produced his will and at his request and in his presence they witnessed the same. Before this was done, testator, in their presence, interlined at the bottom of the first page the words \u2018 or to their heirs.\u2019 After making this addition and after the witnesses had subscribed their names, the testator republished both the will and codicil.\u201d Before this republication he added after \u201c as follows\u201d the words \u201c or to their heirs; \u201d and after William Gilmor, \u201c Deed ; \u201d Samuel Dorrance, \u201c Desed; \u201d James Dorrance, Senior, \u201c Deceased; \u201d Eliza Robinson, \u201cDeseased;\u201d William Dorrance, \u201cDeceased;\u201d Martha A. McClellan, \u201cDsd;\u201d Samuel P. Cummins, \u201cDesed;\u201d William B. Cummins, \u201cDeed.\u201d\nThis will speaks from the date of its republication. In Coale v. Smith, 4 Pa. 386, it was said: \u201c The effect of a new publication is that all which the words embrace at the time when the new publication is made, shall pass thereby ; or, to put it more clearly, when a man republishes his will the effect is that the terms and words of the will should be construed to speak with regard to the property the testator is seized of, and the persons named therein, at the date of the republication, just the same as if he had such additional property or such persons being in esse at the time of making his will, the conclusion from the fact being that the testator so intended. And this is a conclusion of law, as we have seen, not to be contradicted by any supposed absence of intention on the part of the testator, unless a contrary intent be manifested by something appearing in the codicil.\u201d\nIn Linnard\u2019s Appeal, 93 Pa. 316, Mr. Justice Sterrett said: \u201c A duly executed codicil operates as a republication of the original will so as to make it speak as of the date of the codicil : Coale v. Smith, 4 Barr, 386; and it not only operates as an adoption of the prior will to which it refers, but also as a revocation of an intermediate will. In Wikoff\u2019s Ap., 3 Harris, 281, Chief Justice Gibson, in speaking of interlineations proved to be in the handwriting of a testatrix, says: \u2018 The presumption is that they were made at or before the time when the will was prepared for the final act.\u2019 \u201d\nThe testator\u2019s sister having died, his executors filed their account which was referred to the auditor to make distribution. Before him the appellants as heirs at law and next of kin of legatees named in the will claimed six twelfths of the estate, upon the ground that the testator intended by the words \u201c or to their heirs \u201d to substitute for the deceased legatees their next of kin.\nUpon the question of compensation of executors, parol evidence was offered for the purpose of showing that the name of one of the executors was inserted in the will, and on cross-examination one of the witnesses testified: \u201c Q. You witnessed both the will and the codicil that day? A. Yes, sir. Q. Did he submit it to you for your opinion ? A. He asked about those people that were dead. I told him it might lapse and he added \u201c their heirs.\u201d Q. At that time did you read over the will? A. Yes, sir. I looked at the will.\u201d\nThe same witness was recalled and testified as follows, viz.: \u201c Q. Do you know in whose handwriting this will is ? A. The whole will is in the handwriting of John Gilmor, except the word \u2018 witness \u2019 and \u2018 H. Gehr,\u2019 and \u2018 G. D. McDowell.\u2019 Q. Do you know whether this will was all written, just as it now is, at one time ? A. \u2018 Or to their heirs \u2019 was added. Q. In what, connection ? \u2018 I give devise and bequeath in as follows, or to their heirs \u2019 on the last line of the first page \u2014 the last four words on the first page \u2014 you say that they were not in as originally written? A. They were not. Q. On the second page of the will, and the 18th line, were the words \u2018 deceased \u2019 (looks to me like \u2018 desd \u2019) was it in as originally written ? A. The word \u2018 desd.\u2019 Q. Was it in originally? A. No, sir. Q. Whose handwriting are the words \u2018or to their heirs?\u2019 A. John Gilmor\u2019s. Q. In whose handwriting are the words \u2018 desd.\u2019 A. John Gilmor\u2019s. Q. Are those the only alterations that you notice in the will and codicil ? A. I believe so. As I said before, when I saw the will William C. McClelland\u2019s name was not in as one of the executors. Q. At the time the will and codicil were witnessed by yo.u were the words you speak of in the will or were they made subsequently. Was it before that day or not ? A. These were all in before that day. Q. The words \u2018 or to their heirs \u2019 were put there by Mr. Gilmor ? A. In our presence, at the time we witnessed the codicil. Q. Were they put there before or after you signed it ? A. Before. We did not witness it until about the latter part of the summer of 1889. Q. At that date of the codicil do you remember whether these other alterations in the will you have spoken of were in ? A. All the alterations were put in at the same time. Q. Will you please state if you know how John Gilmor came to add these words \u2018 or to their heirs \u2019 and the word \u2018 deceased ? \u2019 A. I told him that Martha McClellan\u2019s might lapse; I knew she was dead. Q. Did he know she was dead ? A. Yes, sir. Q. What did he say or do in consequence of that? A. He said he would alter it the way he did.\u201d\nThe auditor finds \u201c that William Gilmor, Samuel Dorrance', James Dorrance, William Dorrance, Martha A. McClellan, Samuel B. Cummins and William P. Cummins, named in the will, are dead, were all dead before the testator and were all dead at the time of republication above mentioned, which fact was known to testator at that time.\u201d\nThe learned judge below sustained the auditor in not considering this testimony, because an attempt by extrinsic testimony to prove by parol the intention of the testator. The rule is well settled that extrinsic evidence cannot be adduced to qualify, explain, alter or contradict the language, of a will, but it must stand as written, where the intention is clearly expressed and the objects of the bo\u00fanty are definitely ascertained. This rule has been rigidly maintained and doubtless for the protection of estates will continue to be so by judicial decisions. While this is true for some purposes proofs dehors the will may be admitted. It is said in Schouler on Wills, section 579: \u201c But to aid the context by extrinsic proof of the circumstances and situation of the testator when it was executed is constantly permitted at the court\u2019s discretion and this constitutes a proper, indeed often an indispensable, matter of inquiry when construing a will. For whatever a will may set forth on its face, its application is to persons and things external and hence is admitted evidence, outside the instrument, of facts and circumstances, which have any tendency to give effect and.operation to the terms of the will, such as the names, descriptions, and designations of beneficiaries named in the will, the relation they occupy to the testator, whether testator was married or single, and who were his family, what was the state of his property when he made his will, and when he died, and other like collateral circumstances. Such evidence being explanatory and incidental is admitted not for the purpose of introducing new words or a new intention into the will but so as to give an intelligent construction to the words actually used, consistent with the real state of the testator\u2019s family and property; in short, so as to enable the court to stand in the testator\u2019s place, and read it in the light of those surroundings under which it was written and executed.\u201d\nIn Jarman on Wills, volume 1, section 394, it was said: \u201c Though it is (as we have seen) the will itself \u2022 (and not the intentionas elsewhere collected) which'constitutes the real and only subject to be expounded, yet in performing this office a court of construction is not bound to shut its eyes to the state of facts upon which the will was made; on the contrary, an investigation of such facts often materially aids in elucidating the scheme of disposition which occupied the mind of the testator. To this end it is obviously essential that the judicial expositor should place himself as fully as possible in the situation of the person whose language he has to interpret, and guided \u2022by the light thus thrown on the testamentary scheme he may find himself justified in departing from a strict construction of the testator\u2019s language, without allowing conjectural interpretation to usurp the place of judicial interpretation.\u201d\nIt is said in Wharton on Evidence, section 992, in speaking of the exception when extrinsic evidence may be resorted to: \u201c What is said at the time of the execution and attestation is admissible as part of the res gestee, though not to contradict the will.\u201d Again in section 999: \u201c In construing a will so is this position accurately expressed by Blackburn, J., the court is entitled to put itself in the position of the testator and to consider all the material facts and circumstances known to the testator with reference to which he is taken to have used the words in the'will and then declare what the intention evidenced by the words used with reference to these facts and circumstances, which were (or ought to have been) in the mind of the testator when he used those words.\u201d 1\nIt was therefore competent for the purpose of ascertaining the intention of the testator to show that at the time of the republication of his will the words \u201c or to their heirs \u201d were added; that the word \u201c deceased \u201d was added after the name of each of the legatees who were dead, and the circumstances under which it was so added. While this evidence cannot be resorted to either to control or modify the intention of the testator, it may serve to aid in ascertaining what the testator did intend. It is clear that from the fact that he republished his will so modified, and inserted at the time these words, indicating that the legatees in question were dead, that he intended \u201c or to their heirs \u201d as words of substitution. When the original will was executed the legatees in question were alive and when the republication took place thqy were dead. He therefore added after their names \u201c deceased, \u201d and thus clearly indicated that as they were dead they were not to receive the. legacies. Such the case, in order to indicate who were to receive them, he wrote before the list of their names \u201c or to their heirs.\u201d It seems manifest that in making this republication and in writing \u201cdeceased\u201d after the names of these legatees he intended to designate the persons who are to take the legacies in lieu of them.\nIt is contended however that the word \u201c or \u201d is to be read as \u201c and,\u201d reading thus \u201c and to their heirs,\u201d and so reading them they became words of limitation and not of purchase. Words have been transposed to carry out the evident intention of the testator. \u201c Or \u201d has been read as \u201c and \u201d and \u201c and \u201d has been read as \u201c or.\u201d This has been done when it has been necessary to reach the true meaning of a will. No word will be rejected if an intelligent meaning can be given to it. In Gittings v. Mc-Dermott, 2 Mylne and Keene, Chancery Reports, 75, it is said: \u201c The force of the disjunctive word \u2018 or \u2019 is not easily to be got over. Had it been \u2018 and \u2019 the words of limitation would of course, as applied to a chattel interest, have been surplusage, but the disjunctive marks, as plainly as possible, that the testator by using it intended to provide for an alternative bequest namely to the legatees if they should survive and if they should not to their heirs.\u201d In Jarman on Wills, vol. 1, star page 486, it is said : \u201c But since Grey v. Pearson the cases last noticed have lost much of their weight as authorities for applying to any given case the rule which would change \u2018and\u2019 into \u2018or\u2019 in order to prevent one member of a compound sentence being rendered inoperative. Though it be a canon of construction that effect is if possible to be given to every word used, it is one which must bend to circumstances, and where the result of changing \u2018 and \u2019 into \u2018 or \u2019 would be only to render one member of the sentence inoperative instead of the other the change certainly ought not to be made. It does not appear to have been made in any case since Grey v. Pearson, which indeed was treated by Sir J. R\u00f3milly as having overruled Bell v. Phyn, and Maverty v. Stroud, as well as Brownsword v. Evans.\u201d In Appletown v. Rowley, 8 L. R. Eq. 145, it was said: \u201c Where the word \u2018 or \u2019 is used it is intended to prevent a lapse. If in this case the gift after the life estate had been to Sarah Gavwood and Alice Key \u2018 or \u2019 their heirs or representatives I should follow the decision In re Porter\u2019s Trust, In re Newlin\u2019s Trust, and Salsbury v. Petty, and should have held that the children or representatives took by way of substitution, but here unfortunately it is \u2018 and \u2019 their heirs and representatives.\u201d In Morgan v. Thomas, 9 L. R., Q. B. D. 645, S.ir George Jessel illustrated in a somewhat ludicrous way the fallacy of changing the natural meaning of words. He says: \u201c You will find it said in some cases that \u2018 or \u2019 means \u2018 and \u2019 but \u2018 or \u2019 never does mean \u2018 and \u2019 unless there is a context which shows it is for \u2018 and \u2019 by mistake. Suppose a testator said I give the black cow on which I usually ride to A. B., and he usually rode on a black horse, of course, the horse would pass, but I do not think any annotator of cases would put in the marginal notes that \u2018 cow \u2019 means \u2018 horse.\u2019 \u201d In Griffith v. Woodward, 1 Yeates, 318, it was said: \u201c Courts of justice will transpose the clauses of a will and construe \u2018or\u2019 to be \u2018and\u2019 and \u2018 and \u2019 to be \u2018 or \u2019 only in such cases when it is absolutely necessary so to do, to support the evident meaning of the testator. But they cannot arbitrarily expunge or alter words without such apparent necessity.\u201d No reason can be adduced in this case to show a necessity for the change of the word \u201c or \u201d to \u201c and.\u201d The republication of the will, the knowledge of the death of the legatees at that time, the writing the word \u201c deceased\u201d after these names, and before the list of legatees \u201cor to their heirs \u201d indicate words of substitution and that \u201c or \u201d was clearly intended to be used for that purpose.\nIt is contended the position of the words \u201c or to their heirs \u201d is such they cannot have any effect. The will originally read: \u201c I give and bequeath in as follows, \u201c and then follow the names of the legatees. At the republication the words \u201cOr to their heirs \u201d were added after \u201c as follows.\u201d It is clear that the intention was that these words were intended to apply to the respective legatees.\nThe appellees substantially rest their contention upon Sloan v. Hanse, 2 Rawle, 28, and Barnett\u2019s Appeal, 104 Pa. 842. In the first case, decided before the act of 1883 in regard to passing estates without words of inheritance, the legatee was dead; and, the fact being unknown to the testator, that event was not in any degree contemplated by him, it is said : \u201c Had the testator meant to provide against accident from the death of either of the principal objects of his bounty it is reasonable to suppose he would, instead of leaving his meaning to conjecture, have said so in terms. He has not done so and the inference to be drawn from the use of a copulative instead of a disjunctive is too feeble to disinherit the heir.\u201d But in the present case the death of the legatees having taken place before republication he added after each of them the word \u201c deceased \u201d to indicate their death and then \u201c or to their heirs.\u201d He thus intended to use woz\u2019ds of substitution. In other words he intended to exclude a lapse and to indicate those who should take. In the second case, Barnett\u2019s Appeal, the will devised to the four sisters of the testator to each one fourth \u201c to them and to their heirs.\u201d Two of the sisters at the time of the execution of the will wez\u2019e dead. The decision there was that the words \u201c and to their heirs \u201d were words of limitation and that the testator did not intend them as words of purchase. It was said in that case: \u201c There are several cases where the word \u2018 heirs \u2019 has been held to mean children, but they were all instances where such was the intention of the testator as gathered from the will itself. This will contains nothing from which such an intent' can be inferred.\u201d The difference between that case and the present one is marked. The words there used are \u201c to them and to their heirs,\u201d while here the word \u201c deceased\u201d is written after the legatees, and the words used are \u201c or to their heirs.\u201d From the will itself the intent is clear that when the testator republished it and altered its language, inserting the word \u201c deceased\u201d and adding \u201cor to their heirs,\u201d he intended words of substitution and not of limitation. These words being those of substitution, the persons who thus are intended to take can be clearly ascertained. In McKee\u2019s Appeal, 104 Pa. 573, it is said: \u201c In a bequest of personalty, unless a contrary intent is indicated by the will, the word heirs signifies heirs as ascertained by the statute of distribution: Baskin\u2019s Appeal, 3 Pa. 304, Eby\u2019s Appeal, 84 Pa. 241; Bender\u2019s Appeal, 3 Grant, 210.\u201d In Ashton\u2019s Appeal, 134 Pa. 395, Mr. Justice Stebkett says : \u201c When used in a gift of personalty it is very frequently employed to denote those who are entitled to take under the statute of distribution unless there is something to indicate a contrary intention.\u201d We have then in this case words substituting persons to receive as such and such persons clearly ascertainable, and therefore the decree of the orphans\u2019 court is reversed and the record remitted for further proceedings, the appellees to pay the costs of this appeal."}
