{"id": "1090501", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nAppellant sued the County of Luzerne to recover salary alleged to be due him as court interpreter in accordance with the Act of May 6, 1915, P. L. 271, less credits for per diem payments which he admitted had been made for all days of actual service rendered by him. The case was tried by the court below, without a jury, under the Act of April 22,1874, P. L. 109. Judgment was entered for defendant and plaintiff has appealed.\nThe Act of May 8, 1913, P. L. 170, provides that \u201cthe court of common pleas of each county is authorized to employ such number of interpreters......as the court may deem necessary......Any interpreter so appointed shall......receive......such annual or per diem compensation as the appointing court shall fix: Provided, That in counties containing population of one million two hundred thousand inhabitants and over, the salary paid interpreters shall not exceed two thousand dollars per annum for each interpreter. Before assuming the duties of the office, each interpreter shall take and subscribe tbe oatb prescribed in tbe Constitution of this Commonwealth.\u201d\nTwo years later the legislature passed the Act of May 6, 1915, P. L. 271, which provides that in all judicial districts \u201ccontaining more than two hundred and fifty thousand and less than one million inhabitants,\u201d the \u201ccourt interpreter shall be paid a salary of twelve hundred dollars per annum.\u201d In point of population, the district here involved comes within this act.\nWhen considering the above acts, and how far plaintiff can invoke them in support of his suit, it must be remembered that we have said: The word \u201ccourt\u201d in a statute is to be understood as meaning \u201ca tribunal officially assembled under authority of law at an appropriate time and place for the administration of justice,\u201d and not merely a \u201cjudge\u201d thereof; and that, \u201cwhether an act is to be performed by one or the other is generally determined by the character of the act, but whenever it is a statutory power or duty conferred or prescribed upon the court, it can only be discharged by the assembled tribunal, however composed, whether of one judge or several. Take, for instance, the power to appoint and remove......; such power is conferred by statute, not upon the judge, but in express terms upon the court\u201d: Carter\u2019s Est, 254 Pa. 518, 527.\nPlaintiff served from time to time as court interpreter on a per diem basis of compensation prior to 1913, the date of the first of above acts, and so continued thereafter (almost entirely in the criminal courts, being sent for occasionally to do some special service in the common pleas) until he severed his connection with all such work in June, 1919; but he was never appointed by the court of common pleas to the office of interpreter or qualified as required by law. He was designated for the work he performed, not by the court, but by a single judge thereof. Under the circumstances, the court below properly found that, at the most, plaintiff was \u201ca mere interpreter de facto,\u201d not entitled to recover the statutory salary: Riddle v. Bedford, 7 S. & R. 386; Com. ex rel. Bowman v. Slifer, 25 Pa. 23; Luzerne County v. Trimmer, 95 Pa. 97; Jones v. Dusman, 246 Pa. 513.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
