{"id": "4281018", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice SAYLOR.\nThis appeal involves a post-conviction challenge to the imposition of a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, without the possibility of parole, for a murder committed by a juvenile. Specifically, we are asked to determine whether Miller v. Alabama, - U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2455, 183 L.Ed.2d 407 (2012) \u2014 which holds that \u201cthe Eighth Amendment forbids a sentencing scheme that mandates life in prison without possibility of parole for juvenile offenders,\u201d id. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2469 \u2014 applies retroactively to Appellant\u2019s 2002 judgment of sentence, which became final in 2005.\nIn 1999, Appellant, his codefendant, and two accomplices robbed the occupants of a vehicle at gunpoint. In the course of the robbery, Appellant shot and killed the victim, Daniel Delarge, Jr. At the time, Appellant was seventeen years of age.\nIn 2002, Appellant was convicted of second-degree murder and related offenses. He received a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, plus a term of imprisonment of 1% to 15 years. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1102(b); 61 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6137. On direct appeal, the Superior Court affirmed; this Court denied Appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal; and Appellant did not seek discretionary review in the United States Supreme Court.\nAppellant timely filed a post-conviction petition claiming, inter alia, that the life-without-parole sentence violated his rights under the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as extended to the States via the Fourteenth Amendment. As of the initial filing, Appellant relied primarily on Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005), which held that the Constitution precludes entry of a judgment of sentence of death for defendants under the age of eighteen at the time of their capital crime or crimes. See id. at 578, 125 S.Ct. at 1200. The post-conviction court denied the petition without an evidentiary hearing, and the Superior Court affirmed in a memorandum opinion, concluding that Roper had no bearing on life sentences. Appellant filed a petition for allowance of appeal, which was held in abeyance pending the disposition of a petition seeking discretionary review before this Court in Commonwealth v. Batts, 79 MAP 2009. The Batts case concerns a challenge to the imposition of a mandatory life sentence for crimes committed by a minor asserted on direct appeal.\nThe United States Supreme Court issued the Miller decision in June 2012, rendering Pennsylvania\u2019s mandatory scheme of life imprisonment for first- and second-degree murder unconstitutional, as applied to offenders under the age of eighteen at the time of their crimes. Paralleling Batts and Cunningham in this Court, the federal review implemented by the High Court also encompassed one case in the direct-review chain, Miller v. Alabama, No. 10-9646, and another at a post-conviction stage, Jackson v. Hobbs, No. 10-9647. In a deeply divided opinion, the United States Supreme Court reversed the affirmance of the judgment of sentence and the affirmance of a denial of post-conviction relief, respectively, by state-level reviewing courts. See Miller, - U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2475.\nIn its reasoning, the Miller majority initially explained that its decision turned on proportionality. The Supreme Court previously has found this concept to be central to the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment; further, the Court admonished that proportionality is to be assessed \u201cless through a historical prism than according to the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d Id. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2463 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nIn its evolving-standards-of-decency evaluation, the Miller majority found two \u201cstrands of precedent\u201d to be particularly pertinent. Id. The first of these involves the categorical prohibition of certain punishments for specified classes of offenders. The second requires individualized sentencing for defendants facing the death penalty, and, by extension, other of the most serious penalties. See id. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2466.\nBased on these lines of authority, the Miller majority announced that mandatory life-without-parole sentences, as applied to those under the age of eighteen, offend the Eighth Amendment by preventing sentencing authorities from considering juveniles\u2019 \u201cdiminished culpability and heightened capacity for change.\u201d Id. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2469; see also id. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2466 (opining that the \u201cimposition of a State\u2019s most severe penalties on juvenile offenders cannot proceed as though they were not children\u201d); id. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2467 (observing that \u201c[s]uch mandatory penalties, by their nature, preclude a sentencer from taking account of an offender\u2019s age and the wealth of characteristics and circumstances attendant to it\u201d). See generally Cara H. Drinan, Graham on the Ground, 87 Wash. L. Rev. 51, 62 (2012) (observing that the line of decisions including Miller reflect what legal scholars have termed a developing \u201cyouth is different\u201d jurisprudence). The majority also remarked that its decision requires only that a sentencing authority \u201cfollow a certain process\u201d before imposing this harshest possible penalty on a juvenile offender \u2014 entailing consideration of the offender\u2019s youth and attendant characteristics. Miller,-U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2471.\nSignificantly, for present purposes, the Miller majority did not specifically address the question of whether its holding applies to judgments of sentence for prisoners, such as Appellant, which already were final as of the time of the Miller decision. As such, the opinion does not set out the principles governing the High Court\u2019s retroactivity jurisprudence.\nBriefly, Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) (plurality), delineated a general rule of non-retroactivity for new procedural, constitutional rules announced by the Court, Wayne R. Lafave, Jerold H. Israel, Nancy J. King & Or\u00edn S. Kerr, 1 Crim. Proc. \u00a7 2.11(e) (3d ed.2012) (relating that Teague has been described as establishing a \u201claw at the time\u201d principle), subject to two narrow exceptions. This construct was solidified by the majority decision in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 329-30, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 2952-53, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989). As relevant here, the exceptions extend to \u201crules prohibiting a certain category of punishment for a class of defendants because of their status or offense,\u201d Penry, 492 U.S. at 330, 109 S.Ct. at 2953, and \u201cwatershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\u201d Horn v. Banks, 536 U.S. 266, 271 n. 5, 122 S.Ct. 2147, 2150 n. 5, 153 L.Ed.2d 301 (2002) (quoting Saffle, 494 U.S. at 495, 110 S.Ct. at 1264 (internal quotations omitted)). More recently, in Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. 348, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004), the High Court appears to have merged the first Teague exception with the principle that new substantive rules generally apply retroactively. See id. at 351-52 & n. 4. 124 S.Ct. at 2522-23 & n. 4. See generally Drinan, Graham on the Ground, 87 Wash. L.Rev. at 66 (explaining that \u201cthe Court has shifted its terminology somewhat and has described new rules as \u2018substantive\u2019 when they \u2018alter[] the range of conduct or the class of persons that the law punishes,\u2019 rather than describing them as falling within the first of the two nonretroactivity exceptions.\u201d (footnotes omitted)).\nAfter Miller\u2019s issuance, the litigants incorporated their assessments of the decision into their submissions, along with developed arguments concerning its prospective versus retroactive application. It is Appellant\u2019s position that the holding in Miller applies retroactively to prisoners, such as Appellant, serving mandatory life-without-parole sentences for crimes committed as juveniles, even where they have exhausted their direct appeal rights and are proceeding under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. According to Appellant, the United States Supreme Court unambiguously sanctioned retroactive application in Miller, since it reversed the order of a state appellate court affirming the dismissal of a post-conviction petition in the Jackson case. See Miller, \u2014 U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2475. In this respect, Appellant invokes the admonishment that, \u201conce a new rule is applied to the defendant in the case announcing the rule, evenhanded justice requires that it be applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated.\u201d Teague, 489 U.S. at 300, 109 S.Ct. at 1070; see also id. at 315-16, 109 S.Ct. at 1078 (indicating that \u201chabeas corpus cannot be used as a vehicle to create new constitutional rules of criminal procedure unless those rules would be applied retroactively to all defendants on collateral review through one of the two exceptions we have articulated\u201d (emphasis in original)).\nAdditionally, Appellant emphasizes that several of the decisions in the \u201cstrands of precedent\u201d upon which the Miller majority relied are applied retroactively. See, e.g., In re Sparks, 657 F.3d 258, 262 (5th Cir.2011) (observing that Atkins, Roper, and Graham each have been held by various courts to be retroactive). Furthermore, it is Appellant\u2019s position that Miller articulates a rule of substantive law, which, by its nature, is retroactive. See, e.g., Brief for Appellant at 24 (\u201cThe new rule announced in Miller is substantive, and therefore retroactive, because \u2018it alters ... the class of persons that the law punishes.\u2019 \u201d (quoting Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. at 353, 124 S.Ct. at 2519)). For the same reason, even if Teague\u2019s general rule of non-retroactivity were relevant in the first instance, Appellant asserts, the Miller rule meets the first exception to it.\nIn response to Appellant\u2019s lead argument that the holding in Jackson compels retroactive application of Miller in collateral review settings, the Commonwealth observes that the Miller Court did not, in fact, reverse Jackson\u2019s judgment of sentence. Rather, the Commonwealth explains, the United States Supreme Court reversed only the judgments of the state appellate courts and remanded \u201cfor further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\u201d Miller, - U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2475. As such, the Commonwealth posits that the state could raise a Teague bar to the new rule in that case to prevent resentencing. Moreover, the Commonwealth stresses that the Miller majority simply did not address retroactivity, and, thus, there simply is no dispositive ruling on the subject. See Brief for the Commonwealth at 14 (citing Goeke v. Branch, 514 U.S. 115, 117, 115 S.Ct. 1275, 1276, 131 L.Ed.2d 152 (1995) (explaining that \u201ca court need not entertain the [:Teague ] defense if the State has not raised it.\u201d)).\nFurthermore, the Commonwealth highlights: Miller was decided more than six years after Appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence became final and nearly three years after the Superi- or Court affirmed the denial of post-conviction relief; the Teague general rule is one of wow-retroactivity; and the exceptions to that rule have been construed narrowly by the courts.\nIn terms of the first Teague exception, the Commonwealth vigorously refutes Appellant\u2019s contention that Miller entirely forecloses any certain category of punishment for juvenile offenders. According to the Commonwealth, Miller, by its express terms, \u201cbans nothing,\u201d but, rather, concerned only the manner of determining whether a particular sentence should be imposed. Brief for the Commonwealth at 16. In this regard, the Commonwealth quotes the Miller majority\u2019s own depiction of its ruling, as follows:\nOur decision does not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime ... Instead, it mandates only that a sentencer follow a certain process \u2014 considering an offender\u2019s youth and attendant characteristics \u2014 before imposing a particular penalty.\nMiller, - U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2471 (citations omitted; emphasis added); accord id. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2469 (\u201c[W]e do not consider Jackson\u2019s and Miller\u2019s alternative argument that the Eighth Amendment requires a categorical bar on life without parole for juveniles, or at least for those 14 and younger.\u201d). In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, Appellant\u2019s assertion of a categorical bar is tantamount to an exercise in \u201cword games,\u201d in its admixture of procedural and substantive aspects of schemes imposing mandatory life sentences for certain classes of murder. Brief for the Commonwealth at 18 n. 8.\nThe Commonwealth also briefly addresses the second Teague exception for \u201cwatershed rules,\u201d stressing, in particular, the repeated admonitions of the High Court that such exception is tightly limited. See Brief for the Commonwealth at 14 (citing Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. 406, 417-18, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 1181-82, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007) (indicating that, \u201cin the years since Teague, we have rejected every claim that a new rule satisfied the requirements for watershed status\u201d), Schriro v. Summerlin, 542 U.S. at 352, 124 S.Ct. at 2523 (relating that \u201cit is unlikely that any [watershed rule] ha[s] yet to emerge\u201d (internal citations omitted)), and Beard v. Banks, 542 U.S. 406, 417, 124 S.Ct. 2504, 2513-14, 159 L.Ed.2d 494 (2004) (\u201c[I]t should come as no surprise that we have yet to find a new rule that falls under the second Teague exception.\u201d)).\nIn terms of Appellant\u2019s argument that the retroactive application of cases from the two \u201cstrands of precedent\u201d relied upon by the Miller majority compels Miller\u2019s own retrospective application, the Commonwealth regards the contention as \u201clegally incoherent.\u201d Brief for the Commonwealth at 15; see also id. at 15-16 (\u201cThere is no \u2018strands of precedent\u2019 exception to Teague [.]\u201d). As to cases within the first strand, the Commonwealth rests on its observation that it is the nature of the rules in issue as substantive rules that resulted in retroactive application, whereas, the Commonwealth maintains, the Miller rule is purely a procedural one. With regard to the second strand, the Commonwealth highlights that various cases that require consideration of \u201cthe characteristics of a defendant and the details of his offense before sentencing him\u201d are indeed subject to Teague. Id. at 16; accord LaFave, 7 Crim. Proc. \u00a7 28.6(e) (\u201cSince Teague, the Court has rejected arguments that other procedural requirements for death sentences [should] be applied retroactively.\u201d).\nIt is the Commonwealth\u2019s core position that Appellant\u2019s claim must be decided under the law as it stood at the time his conviction became final in 2005.\nBoth parties have presented post-submission communications, with Appellant furnishing copies of recent decisions finding Miller to be retroactive, see, e.g., State v. Ragland, 836 N.W.2d 107 (Iowa 2013); Jones v. State, 122 So.3d 698 (Miss.2013); People v. Williams, 367 Ill.Dec. 503, 982 N.E.2d 181 (2012); People v. Morfin, 367 Ill.Dec. 282, 981 N.E.2d 1010 (2012), and the Commonwealth pinpointing decisions finding Miller to be non-retroactive, see, e.g., In re Morgan, 713 F.3d 1365 (11th Cir.2013); Chambers v. State, 831 N.W.2d 311 (Minn.2013); Craig v. Cain, No. 12-30035, slip op., 2013 WL 69128; People v. Carp, 298 Mich.App. 472, 828 N.W.2d 685 (2012); Geter v. State, 115 So.3d 375 (Fla.App.2012). Our review of the legal issues presented is plenary.\nAs a threshold matter, we reiterate that Appellant\u2019s position that we are obliged to apply Miller retroactively is based solely upon retroactivity principles applied by the United States Supreme Court in conjunction with its development of federal constitutional doctrine. This limitation is significant, because the High Court has determined that Teague does not limit the authority of state courts to provide remedies for violations deemed non-retroactive under Teague. See Danforth v. Minnesota, 552 U.S. 264, 282, 128 S.Ct. 1029, 1042, 169 L.Ed.2d 859 (2008).\nThis Court, however, generally has looked to the Teague doctrine in determining retroactivity of new federal constitutional rulings. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hughes, 581 Pa. 274, 306-10, 865 A.2d 761, 780-82 (2004). Certainly, this practice is subject to potential refinement, since \u201cthe Teague rule of nonretroactivity was fashioned to achieve the goals of federal habeas while minimizing federal intrusion into state criminal proceedings.\u201d Danforth, 552 U.S. at 280, 128 S.Ct. at 1041. Accordingly, the Teague doctrine is not necessarily a natural model for retroactivity jurisprudence as applied at the state level. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Bracey, 604 Pa. 459, 486, 986 A.2d 128, 144 (2009) (recognizing that \u201ca more sophisticated analysis\u201d may be required on state collateral review in some circumstances); see also supra note 7 (alluding to a few potential criticisms of Teague and its progeny).\nOur present, default practice of proceeding no further than Teague requires as a matter of federal constitutional law is, in part, a function of the arguments which have been presented to us, where, as here, the litigants have not provided developed argumentation to assist in the fashioning of any broader retroactivity principles. Moreover, state judges who may be circumspect about evolving normative pronouncements of five of nine Justices \u2014 which forcefully are rejected by four others \u2014 may be reluctant to apply those standards more broadly than is absolutely required. Cf. Commonwealth v. Sanchez, 614 Pa. 1, 70, 36 A.3d 24, 66 (2011) (reflecting a reluctance, in the absence of a common law policy or directive from the Pennsylvania General Assembly, to \u201cgo further than what is affirmatively commanded by the High Court\u201d in the implementation of new federal constitutional doctrine). Thus, litigants who may advocate broader retrospective extension of a new federal constitutional rule would do best to try to persuade this Court both that the new rule is resonate with Pennsylvanian norms and that there are good grounds to consider the adoption of broader retroactivity doctrine which would permit the rule\u2019s application at the collateral review stage. In the latter regard, the Court would benefit from recognition and treatment of the strong interest in finality inherent in an orderly criminal justice system, as well as the social policy and concomitant limitations on the courts\u2019 jurisdiction and authority reflected in the Post Conviction Relief Act. Because the appellant in this matter has not set an appropriate stage for either pillar of such review, the Teague line of analysis remains the appropriate default litmus governing the present appeal.\nHere, we find the application of this analysis to be fairly straightforward. Initially, we reject Appellant\u2019s position that the Miller Court\u2019s reversal of the state appellate court decision affirming the denial of post-conviction relief in the Jackson case compels the conclusion that Miller is retroactive. In the first instance, it is not clear that the issue was even placed before the Court, and, as the Commonwealth observes, the Supreme Court need not entertain questions of retroactive application where the government has not raised it. See Goeke, 514 U.S. at 117, 115 S.Ct. at 1276; cf. Carp, 828 N.W.2d at 713 (\u201cIn Jackson, because the State did not raise the issue of retroactivity, the necessary predicate for the Court to resolve the question of retroactivity was waived.\u201d). Whether the matter was waived or, as the Commonwealth contends, remained available to be asserted on remand is of no moment here, since the United States Supreme Court has made clear enough that Teague determinations are not inherently implicit in all new constitutional rulings implemented by that Court. But see Williams, 367 Ill.Dec. 503, 982 N.E.2d at 197 (deriving support for the holding that Miller\u2019s holding is retroactive from its disposition of the Jackson case); Morfin, 367 Ill.Dec. 282, 981 N.E.2d at 1023 (same). Rather, in the absence of a specific, principled retroactivity analysis by the United States Supreme Court (or a functional equivalent), we do not believe that a Teague assessment by subordinate state courts is foreclosed.\nWe also agree with the Commonwealth that the first Teague exception does not apply to the Miller rule. Since, by its own terms, the Miller holding \u201cdoes not categorically bar a penalty for a class of offenders,\u201d Miller, - U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2471, (and because it does not place any conduct beyond the State\u2019s power to punish at all, see supra note 6), it is procedural and not substantive for purposes of Teague. Accord, e.g., Craig v. Cain, No. 12-30035, slip op., 2013 WL 69128, at *2 (\u201cMiller does not satisfy the test ... because it does not categorically bar all sentences of life imprisonment for juveniles; Miller bars only those sentences made mandatory by a sentencing scheme.\u201d).\nAs to the second Teague exception, as we have previously noted, Appellant has not developed his arguments in such terms. We will say that, given the high importance attached by the Miller majority to the new rule which it discerned, it seems possible that some Justices of the United States Supreme Court may find the rule to be of the watershed variety. Accord Williams, 367 Ill.Dec. 503, 982 N.E.2d at 197 (holding that Miller\u2019s holding qualifies as a watershed rule of criminal procedure under the second Teague, exception). We doubt, however, that a majority of the Justices would broaden the exception beyond the exceedingly narrow (or, essentially, class-of-one) parameters reflected in the line of decisions referenced by the Commonwealth. Accord Chambers, 831 N.W.2d at 311 (concluding that Miller does not establish a watershed rule because it focuses exclusively on sentencing and does not alter bedrock procedural elements essential to fairness of a proceeding); Craig v. Cain, No. 12-30035, 2013 WL 69128, at *2 (depicting Miller as \u201can outgrowth of the Court\u2019s prior decisions that pertain to individualized-sentencing determinations,\u201d rather than a watershed rule broadly impacting fundamental fairness and accuracy in the proceedings). According to the Court, the exception is limited to \u201csweeping\u201d changes on the order of Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963) (holding that all indigent defendants charged with felonies are entitled to appointed counsel); modifications of a less broadscale nature, while they may be very important, simply do not require retroactive application, under the second Teague exception. Whorton v. Bockting, 549 U.S. at 421, 127 S.Ct. at 1183-84 (citations omitted).\nAll Justices of this Court and the United States Supreme Court share the sentiment that \u201c[determining the appropriate sentence for a teenager convicted of murder presents grave and challenging questions of morality and social policy.\u201d Miller, - U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2477 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting, joined by Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, JJ.). Our role in establishing social policy in the arena is a limited one, however. Here, applying settled principles of appellate review, nothing in Appellant\u2019s arguments persuades us that Miller\u2019s proscription of the imposition of mandatory life-without-parole sentences upon offenders under the age of eighteen at the time their crimes were committed must be extended to those whose judgments of sentence were final as of the time of Miller\u2019s announcement. See generally Geter, 115 So.3d at 377 (\u201cClearly and unequivocally, the Supreme Court distinguished between the substantive determinations of a categorical bar prohibiting a \u2018penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime,\u2019 as in Roper and Graham, and the procedural determination in Miller that merely requires consideration of mitigating factors of youth in the sentencing process.\u201d (quoting Miller, \u2014 U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2471)). See generally LaFave, 1 Crim. Proc. \u00a7 2.11(e) (\u201cTeague has made new rulings very rarely applicable retroactively on habeas review[.]\u201d).\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices EAKIN and STEVENS join the opinion.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a concurring opinion.\nJustice BAER files a dissenting opinion in which Justices TODD and McCAFFERY join.\n. Under the Juvenile Act, murder is excluded from the definition of delinquent acts generally adjudicated by juvenile courts. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6302, 6322(a). Accordingly, murder prosecutions are commenced in adult criminal court, subject to the potential for transfer to juvenile court, upon an appropriate showing by a defendant. See id. \u00a7 6322(a).\n. See id. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2463 (citing Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.S. 407, 128 S.Ct. 2641, 171 L.Ed.2d 525 (2008) (holding that imposing the death penally for non-homicide crimes violates the Eighth Amendment); Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002) (banning the execution of mentally retarded individuals); Roper, 543 U.S. at 578, 125 S.Ct. at 1200; and Graham v. Florida, 560 U.S. 48, 81-82, 130 S.Ct. 2011, 2034, 176 L.Ed.2d 825 (2010) (holding that a life-without-parole sentence violates the Eighth Amendment, when imposed on a juvenile non-homicide offender)).\n. See id. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2463-64 (citing Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280, 96 S.Ct. 2978, 49 L.Ed.2d 944 (1976) (plurality) (holding that a North Carolina statute requiring a mandatory death sentence for first-degree murder violated the Eighth Amendment), and Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978) (plurality) (invalidating an Ohio statute which limited the range of mitigation which could be considered by the sentencing authority in a capital proceeding)).\n. The Miller decision subsumes three separate dissenting opinions supported, to various measures, by four Justices, demonstrating, at the very least, that the evolving norms discerned by the majority Justices are not universally shared. See, e.g., Miller, - U.S. at-, 132 S.Ct. at 2477 (Roberts, C.J., joined by Scalia, Thomas, and Alito, JJ., dissenting) (\"Put simply, if a 17-year-old is convicted of deliberately murdering an innocent victim, it is not \u2018unusual\u2019 for the murderer to receive a mandatory sentence of life without parole. That reality should preclude finding that mandatory life imprisonment for juvenile killers violates the Eighth Amendment.\u201d).\nIn a joining concurrence, Justice Breyer, joined by Justice Sotomayor, took the position that the federal constitution requires a determination that the defendant \"killed or intended to kill\u201d the victim before the State may seek even discretionary imposition of a life-without-parole sentence. See Miller, - U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2475-77 (Breyer, J., concurring). The opinion reflects a concern that strict application of felony-murder and transferred-intent theories may produce an untenable mismatch between culpability and punishment as applied to individuals under the age of eighteen. See id.\n. There is no dispute in the present appeal that Miller embodies a new constitutional rule. See Teague 489 U.S. at 301, 109 S.Ct. at 1070 (\u201cIn general ... a case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government\u201d or \"was not dictated by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final\u201d (emphasis in original)); see also Graham v. Collins, 506 U.S. 461, 467, 113 S.Ct. 892, 898, 122 L.Ed.2d 260 (1993) (explaining that \"unless reasonable jurists hearing [a] petitioner\u2019s claim at the time his conviction became final 'would have felt compelled by existing precedent' to rule in his favor, we are barred from doing so now\" (quoting Saffle v. Parks, 494 U.S. 484, 488, 110 S.Ct. 1257, 1260, 108 L.Ed.2d 415 (1990))). See generally LaFave, 1 Crim. Proc. \u00a7 2.11(e) (\"Under a long line of Teague progeny, any reading of Supreme Court precedent that is more expansive than what was \u2018dictated\u2019 by that precedent \u2014 i.e., any reading beyond the narrowest reasonable reading of that precedent \u2014 can readily be viewed as a 'new rule.\u2019 \u201d (footnote omitted)).\nAs developed below, however, the litigants differ concerning whether Miller\u2019s effect is substantive versus procedural.\n. The first Teague exception also extends to new rules placing certain primary conduct beyond the State\u2019s power to punish at all. See Penry, 492 U.S. at 330, 109 S.Ct. at 2953.\n. One effect of this merger is to solidify, and narrow, the range of matters which may be denominated as substantive. Such limitation may be salutary in terms of enhancing the accessibility and certainty of retroactivity doctrine, see generally Laudenberger v. Port Auth., 496 Pa. 52, 56, 436 A.2d 147, 150 (1981) (remarking, albeit in a different context, that the \u201cattempt to devise a universal principle for determining whether a rule is inherently procedural or substantive in nature has met with little success in the history of our jurisprudence\u201d). It seems problematic, to this author at least, to the degree that it excludes matters which otherwise appear to have a potent substantive dynamic (under the more conventional understanding of the word \"substantive\u201d).\nIn this regard, to some degree, modern application of the Teague doctrine may be viewed, by some, as more an exercise in (perhaps necessary) line drawing than as a precise demarcation between rules which are innately substantive versus procedural in character, or as an effort to address the treatment of the vast range of rules having both attributes in varying degrees.\n. Appellant also relies upon Tyler v. Cain, 533 U.S. 656, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001), as does the Commonwealth. While the majority opinion in Tyler contains numerous statements and explanations concerning retroactivity, it arose in the context of the limits on successive habeas corpus petitions imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 1214 (the \"AEDPA\u201d). See Tyler, 533 U.S. at 660, 121 S.Ct. at 2481. Such enactment substantially curtails the justiciability of serial petitions, subject to a few exceptions, including for claims that \"rel[y] on a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added).\nWe find it unnecessary, for purposes of the present appeal, to decipher if, or to what extent, the High Court's statements concerning the effect of the AEDPA upon serial, federal habeas corpus claims impact upon the application of the judicially crafted Teague construct as applied in the setting of a state post-conviction petition.\n. Notably, while Appellant alludes to the second Teague exception in discussing the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, he does not advance any argument that such exception applies to the rule of law announced in Miller.\n. As it turns out, the state did not do so in Jackson, but, rather, conceded retroactivity. See Jackson v. Norris, 2013 Ark. 175, 426 S.W.3d 906 (2013). Given this concession, the Arkansas Supreme Court did not perform a principled Teague analysis, which is our task here.\n. See, e.g., Beard v. Banks, 542 U.S. at 419-20, 124 S.Ct. at 2515 (holding that an Eighth Amendment capital sentencing rule invalidating instructions that prevent some jurors from considering mitigating evidence was new and inapplicable on collateral review per Teague); Graham v. Collins, 506 U.S. at 463, 113 S.Ct. at 895 (declining to \"decide whether the jury that sentenced [a prisoner] to death was able to give effect, consistent with the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, to mitigating evidence of [the prisoner\u2019s] youth, family background, and positive character traits,\u201d because doing so would require retrospective application of a new rule, contrary to Teague). See generally Craig v. Cain, No. 12-30035, slip op., 2013 WL 69128, at *2 (5th Cir. Jan. 4, 2013) (explaining that \"the Supreme Court has denied retroactive application of prohibitions against weighing invalid aggravating circumstances in certain circumstances, imposition of a death sentence by a jury that has been led to believe responsibility for determining the appropriateness of a death sentence rests elsewhere, and capital-sentencing schemes that foreclose a jury from considering all mitigating evidence.\u201d).\n. Some majority rulings of the United States Supreme Court have espoused the position that \"new rules\u201d are not really \u201cnew rules\u201d at all, but rather, lie in a sort of inert existence prior to the date of their announcement. See, e.g., Danforth, 552 U.S. at 271, 128 S.Ct. at 1035 (\"As we have already explained, the source of a \u2018new rule' is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law. Accordingly, the underlying right necessarily pre-exists our articulation of the new rule.\u201d). In our view, however, this sort of originalist philosophy is inconsistent with the \"evolving standards\u201d overlay which has been engrafted onto the Eighth Amendment, as reflected in Miller and its predecessors. Conceptually, we are unable to grasp that a specific right which has \"evolved\u201d from a source that did not originally contemplate that right \u2014 albeit that the source may have allowed for later evolutionary expansion \u2014 rationally can be said to have pre-existed the evolutionary process which produced it. The reluctance to expand new rules announced under the High Court\u2019s evolving-standards jurisprudence into the state post-conviction context beyond what is required of this Court may also be explained, partly, in terms of this conceptual difference. Cf. generally Drinan, Graham on the Ground, 87 Wash. L.Rev. at 64 (observing that \"scholars historically have criticized the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s opaque retroactivity doctrine\u201d (footnote omitted)).\n. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Sam, 597 Pa. 523, 542, 952 A.2d 565, 576 (2008) (\"There is absolutely no doubt that there is an enduring societal interest in the finality of criminal proceedings\u201d); accord Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 556, 118 S.Ct. 1489, 1501, 140 L.Ed.2d 728 (1998) (\"Only with real finality can the victims of crime move forward knowing the moral judgment will be carried out.\u201d); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 491, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 1468, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991) (\"One of the law's very objects is the finality of its judgments.\u201d); Witt v. State, 387 So.2d 922, 929 (Fla.1980) (opining that emergent, \"evolutionary refinements\u201d in criminal law \"do not compel an abridgement of the finality of judgments,\u201d at the expense of stability, predictability, and manageability of the justice system).\n. See also Morgan, 713 F.3d at 1367-68 (finding Miller to be non-substantive because it regulates only the manner of determining the degree of a defendant\u2019s culpability); Chambers, 831 N.W.2d at 329 (reasoning that the Miller rule is procedural, inter alia, because it \"does not eliminate the power of the State to impose the punishment of life imprisonment without the possibility of release upon a juvenile offender who has committed a homicide offense.\u201d); Geter, 115 So.3d at 377 (\"Clearly and unequivocally, the Supreme Court distinguished between the substantive determinations of a categorical bar prohibiting a \u2018penalty for a class of offenders or type of crime,\u2019 as in Roper and Graham, and the procedural determination in Miller that merely requires consideration of mitigating factors of youth in the sentencing process.\u201d (quoting Miller, - U.S. at -, 132 S.Ct. at 2471)). See generally LaFave, 7 Crim. Proc. \u00a7 28.6(e) (\"Miller, unlike other rules applied retroactively under Teague, was primarily a procedural, not a substantive decision.\"). But see Jones, 122 So.3d at 701 (finding the Miller rule to be substantive in character); Morfin, 367 Ill.Dec. 282, 981 N.E.2d at 1022 (same)."}
