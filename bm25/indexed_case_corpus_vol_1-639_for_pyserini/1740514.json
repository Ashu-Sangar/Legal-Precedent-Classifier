{"id": "1740514", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, William Fultz, was tried by a judge sitting with a jury and was convicted of murder of the first degree. Post-verdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. This appeal followed.\nThe facts are as follows. At approximately 9:00 p. m. on December 12, 1974, Maryann O\u2019Bryant was walking in the 3100 block of West Page Street, Philadelphia. She saw Gary Johnson walk to the corner of 32nd and West Page and look around. Immediately thereafter, she and her companions met appellant and Calvin Martin. At the time, O\u2019Bryant saw a brown wooden object under appellant\u2019s jacket. Martin and appellant then walked in the direction of 3125 West Page Street.\nJoanne Cox, who lived at 3125 West Page Street, testified that around 9:00 p. m., she was in her house talking to Jonathan Kent, the victim, when Edgar Greenwood entered. Greenwood walked into the kitchen and told Cox he would like to speak with her privately. He asked Cox about her relationship with the victim, Jonathan Kent, and she replied that they were good friends. Cox asked Greenwood why he wanted to know and Greenwood replied that she would soon be dating him (Greenwood). When Cox and Greenwood re-entered the livingroom, Kent left the house through the front door. While on the porch, Kent was shot and killed by assailants using a shotgun and a .38 caliber pistol. When the shooting occurred, Greenwood ran out the backdoor of the Cox house.\nAfter the shots were fired, O\u2019Bryant saw appellant with Martin and Johnson running on Page Street. She noticed Johnson throwing away a pistol and appellant discarding a shotgun. The handle of the shotgun was the same color as the brown object O\u2019Bryant had seen under appellant\u2019s coat. Appellant, Martin and Johnson got in an automobile and drove away.\nAppellant argues first that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for murder of the first degree. We do not agree.\nIn Commonwealth v. Rose, 463 Pa. 264, 267-68, 344 A.2d 824, 825-26 (1975), we stated:\n\u201cThe test of sufficiency of the evidence is whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and drawing the proper inferences favorable to the Commonwealth, the trier of fact could reasonably have found that all of the elements of the crime had been established beyond a reasonable doubt. Moreover, it is the province of the trier of fact to pass upon the credibility of witnesses and the weight to be accorded the evidence produced. . . . The fact-finder is free to believe all, part, or none of the evidence. . \u201d (Citations omitted.)\nIn light of this standard, we believe the evidence was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty of murder of the first degree. Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, as amended March 26, 1974, P.L. 213, No. 46, \u00a7 4, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502.\nFollowing trial, appellant\u2019s trial counsel filed boiler plate post-verdict motions challenging only the sufficiency of the evidence. Counsel attempted to raise other issues, but the trial court properly refused to consider them because of Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123(a) and our decision in Commonwealth v. Blair, 460 Pa. 31, 331 A.2d 213 (1975). On appeal, appellant is represented by different counsel and now challenges trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness. Commonwealth v. Dancer, 460 Pa. 95, 331 A.2d 435 (1975). Appellant\u2019s allegations of his trial counsel\u2019s incompetence deal with the failure to include certain allegations of error in written post-verdict motions.\nIn Commonwealth v. Rice, 456 Pa. 90, 318 A.2d 705 (1974), this court held that counsel is not ineffective for failing to raise baseless or frivolous issues. With this standard in mind, we will discuss appellant\u2019s claims concerning his trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness.\nAppellant argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to include in written post-verdict motions an objection to the alleged hearsay of certain portions of Cox\u2019s trial testimony. The questioned evidence involves Cox\u2019s testimony about the conversation between Greenwood and herself in the kitchen of her home. As previously stated, Cox testified that Greenwood asked about her relationship with Kent and then announced that she would soon be dating him (Greenwood). Appellant believes that this testimony was hearsay and thus excludable. We do not agree.\nIn Commonwealth v. Wright, 455 Pa. 480, 485, 317 A.2d 271, 273 (1974), we stated: \u201cThe hearsay rule does not apply to all statements made to or overheard by a witness, but only those statements which are offered as proof of the truth of what is said.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In this case, the statement was not introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted, i. e., that Cox would be dating Greenwood in the future. The statement was admitted rather to prove that the killing was one of \u201clying in wait,\u201d thus making the crime murder of the first degree.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s theory in this case was that Greenwood was acting in concert with appellant, Johnson and Martin in the killing of the victim. The Commonwealth argued, and the argument is supported by the evidence and its reasonable inferences, that Greenwood\u2019s role was to lure Kent out the front door of Cox\u2019s house where appellant and Martin were waiting with the shotgun and .38 caliber pistol. Greenwood\u2019s statement was introduced merely to prove that the statement was made and to bolster the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the killing, and not for the truth of the matter asserted. As such, the statement was not hearsay and was thus, properly admitted. Commonwealth v. Lopinson, 427 Pa. 284, 234 A.2d 552 (1967).\nAppellant next argues that trial counsel was ineffective in failing to preserve for appellate review various instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct, thus entitling appellant to a new trial. Appellant complains of various instances of misconduct during the prosecutor\u2019s opening remarks. Appellant argues that in two instances, the prosecutor made remarks which were not supported by the record. During his opening statement, the prosecutor indicated that appellant and his cohorts had \u201cset a trap\u201d to murder the victim. Appellant claims the record does not support such statement, but this argument is frivolous. As previously indicated, the Commonwealth was justified in advancing this argument, since Greenwood\u2019s statement to Cox supports such an argument. As the evidence does support the claim made in the prosecutor\u2019s opening, trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to include this claim in written post-verdict motions.\nAt another portion of his opening, the prosecutor stated:\n\u201c . . . You will hear from a man by the name of Anthony Brothers. He will tell you the reason for this shooting. ... So, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you will hear a classic case of first degree murder. . . \u201d\nSince Anthony Brothers never testified, appellant argues that he is entitled to a new trial, based on our decision in Commonwealth v. Fairbanks, 453 Pa. 90, 306 A.2d 866 (1973). We do not agree.\nIn Fairbanks, supra, 453 Pa. at 95, 306 A.2d at 868, we stated:\n\u201cThe prosecutor\u2019s remarks in his opening statement must be \u2018fair deductions from evidence expected to be presented.\u2019 His remarks cannot be \u2018mere assertions intended to inflame the passions of the jury.\u2019 Commonwealth v. Meyers, 290 Pa. 573, 580, 139 A. 374, 377 (1927); Commonwealth v. Hoffman, 439 Pa. 348, 354, 266 A.2d 726, 730 (1970).\n\u201cThe American Bar Association Standards for Criminal Justice provide the following standard for the prosecutor: \u2018In his opening statement the prosecutor should confine his remarks to evidence he intends to offer which he believes in good faith will be available and admissible and a brief statement of the issues in the case. It is unprofessional conduct to allude to any evidence unless there is a good faith and reasonable basis for believing that such evidence will be tendered and admitted in evidence.\u2019 ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Standards Relating to The Prosecution Function and The Defense Function, \u00a7 5.5 (Approved Draft, 1971).\n\u201cIn his opening statement, the prosecutor should be scrupulous to avoid any utterance he cannot support later with such evidence. ABA Standards, supra, Commentary to \u00a7 5.5.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nWe find no violation of the Fairbanks mandate.\nIn the instant case, the prosecutor intended to call Brothers, who would have testified that two weeks before the homicide, Calvin Martin, Gary Johnson and other unknown individuals entered the residence of Brothers and Kent and robbed the pair. During the robbery, Brothers and Kent got into a fistfight with the robbers. A few days later, Martin and appellant entered a barbershop where Brothers was sitting, apparently looking for Kent and Brothers. After showing Brothers a shotgun under Martin\u2019s coat, the pair left the barbershop and shot and killed Brothers\u2019 dog, which had been tied up outside the barbershop.\nWhen Brothers was called to testify, appellant requested an offer of proof. The prosecutor told the court that since appellant was an associate of Martin and Johnson, he believed Brothers\u2019 testimony would show that the killing of Kent was in response to the fistfight at the original robbery. The trial court, however, refused to allow Brothers\u2019 testimony because appellant was not present at the original robbery. While we do not express an opinion on the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling, we believe the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement was made in good faith, based on a reasonable belief that the evidence was admissible. Trial counsel therefore was not ineffective for failing to include this claim in post-verdict motions.\nAppellant next argues that the prosecutor overstepped his bounds in his opening address when he told the jury that the slaying was accomplished Jby \u201cambush\u201d while \u201clying in wait.\u201d Appellant believes such an argument was not supported by evidence. As previously discussed, however, we believe it was reasonable to classify the circumstances surrounding this slaying as an ambush. Counsel was not ineffective for failing to include this claim in written post-verdict motions.\nAppellant next argues that counsel was ineffective in failing to include in written post-verdict motions allegations of error concerning certain \u201cprejudicial\u201d remarks by the prosecutor about \u201cgangs.\u201d We do not agree.\nDuring his opening address, the prosecutor told the jury that the victim\u2019s aunt would testify that the victim was not a member of any gang. After objection, the court gave a cautionary instruction which satisfied defense counsel. No motion for a mistrial was made. Under these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s instruction cured any prejudicial effect. Commonwealth v. Whitfield, 474 Pa. 27, 376 A.2d 617 (1977). To include this argument in post-verdict motions would have been a futile gesture. Appellant\u2019s claim is thus meritless.\nAppellant next argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to include in post-verdict motions an allegation of error concerning the testimony of Philadelphia police officer John Pender. We do not agree. One of the first police officers to arrive at the scene of the shooting was Officer John Pender. When questioned at trial as to his assignment within the police force, Pender testified that he was assigned to gang control within the Juvenile Aid Division. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s objection. As the prosecutor never argued that the slaying was gang related, we can see no harm in the testimony. Appellant\u2019s trial counsel was thus not ineffective for failing to include this claim in written post-verdict motions.\nDuring the trial, appellant and his accomplices were referred to by their nicknames. Appellant contends that these references allowed the jury to infer that Kent\u2019s slaying was gang-related and, therefore, the references were prejudicial. Appellant claims that his counsel was ineffective in failing to include these occurrences in post-verdict motions. We do not agree.\nWe do not believe that merely because appellant and his accomplices were referred to by their nicknames, does the inference logically flow, as appellant contends, that a nickname denotes gang activity. Moreover, the prosecutor never argued to the jury nor was any evidence presented to the jury that the slaying was gang-related. Given the above considerations, the failure to include the allegation of error in post-verdict motions was not ineffective assistance of counsel.\nAppellant next contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to include in post-verdict motions an alleged instance when the prosecutor expressed his opinion on the credibility of Commonwealth witness Maryann O\u2019Bryant. During his closing argument, defense counsel sought to discredit 0\u2019Bryant\u2019s testimony by pointing to various circumstances which allegedly showed she was not a believable witness. Defense counsel then asked:\n\u201cWhy would she come down here and tell you about that the way she did? Why would she testify? Now, I don\u2019t know what Mr. Murray [the District Attorney] is going to say about that. Maybe he will say, well, she had the determination to tell the truth and she came up and stood before all of you and said it.\u201d\nDuring his summation, the prosecutor argued that O\u2019Bryant was neither a \u201ctramp\u201d nor a \u201cbum,\u201d and then went on to state:\n\u201c . . .You decide and you determine whether he\u2019s guilty or not guilty, and I tell you sincerely if you believe, and there were inferences and hints added in the cross-examination of Maryann O\u2019Bryant, if you believe that I put her up to lie on the stand or she lied to you during the course of her examination, then you should find this defendant not guilty and not even leave the jury box. But again I ask you to ask yourselves, why would she lie? Why would she say what she did in this particular case? Why?\u201d\nAppellant moved for a mistrial, which was denied. The court, however, gave the following cautionary instruction:\n\u201c . . . If, during the course of the District Attorney\u2019s address to you you may have felt that he might have rendered his opinion as to any of the evidence in the case you are to disregard such statements as to his opinion. The determination of the evidence in the case is for the Jury. The characterization of testimony and the opinion as to the testimony by the District Attorney should be disregarded. If he did, you disregard those statements.\u201d\nAppellant now contends trial counsel was ineffective in failing to include this claim in post-verdict motions. We do not agree.\nIn Commonwealth v. Stasko, 471 Pa. 373, 386, 370 A.2d 350, 357 (1977), we stated:\n\u201c . . . We have made it \u2018emphatically clear that expression of personal belief has no place in the argument of a district attorney to the jury.\u2019 Commonwealth v. Russell, 456 Pa. 559, 563, 322 A.2d 127, 130 (1974). When prejudicial remarks are made by the prosecution, however, the trial judge may, under certain circumstance and if the impropriety is timely brought to the court\u2019s attention, correct the error. \u2018Indeed, control of the prosecution\u2019s comments is largely delegated to the discretion of the trial judge.\u2019 Commonwealth v. Silvis, 445 Pa. 235, 237, 284 A.2d 740, 741 (1971). Here, the indiscretion was quickly noted by objection and curative instructions were delivered. The question remains whether the instructions adequately protected the rights of the accused. In Commonwealth v. Russell, supra, we held that the trial judge\u2019s instruction to the jury was insufficient to erase the prejudice of a witness\u2019 testimony. There, the witness testified as to the guilt or innocence of the defendant and also expressed his opinion that all the defense witnesses were lying. Compared with those comments, the single irresponsible remark of the prosecutor in this case was of a less prejudicial nature and, certainly, curable. The remark was not directed to the guilt or innocence of the accused. Nor did the prosecutor blanketly attack the appellant\u2019s credibility. Under the circumstances, we find that the trial judge\u2019s instructions were sufficient to assure the appellant of a fair and impartial trial. See Commonwealth v. Stoltzfus, 462 Pa. 43, 337 A.2d 873 (1975).\u201d\nAssuming, arguendo, that the complained of portion of the district attorney\u2019s summation was an opinion on credibility, we believe Stasko is indistinguishable from the instant case and thus find no ineffectiveness for failing to include this argument in post-verdict motions.\nAppellant\u2019s final allegation of ineffective assistance of trial counsel concerns the failure of counsel to request a charge on murder of the second degree. At the time of this homicide, murder was divided into three degrees, with murder of the second degree encompassing the felony-murder doctrine. Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, as amended, Act of March 26, 1974, P.L. 213, No. 46, \u00a7 4, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2502(b).\nIn this case, there was no evidence of any underlying felony and the Commonwealth told the judge and jury it would not seek the death penalty. After convicting appellant of murder of the first degree, the jury was instructed by the trial court to set the penalty at life imprisonment and this instruction was followed.\nSince murder of the second degree would have been a compromise verdict, we fail to see how its submission to the jury could have helped appellant. Even if the jury had reached a verdict of murder of the second degree, appellant would still have received the same life sentence, as a conviction for murder of the second degree also carries a life sentence. We thus find appellant\u2019s claim to be meritless.\nHaving found sufficient evidence to sustain appellant\u2019s judgment of sentence for murder of the first degree and having determined that trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to include meritless and frivolous issues in written post-verdict motions, the judgment of sentence is affirmed.\nPOMEROY, J., joins in this opinion and also files a concurring opinion.\nROBERTS, NIX and MANDERINO, JJ., concur in the result.\nPACKEL, J., took no part in the decision of this case.\n. Act 0f December 6, 1972, P.L. 1482, No. 334, \u00a7 1, 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2501."}
