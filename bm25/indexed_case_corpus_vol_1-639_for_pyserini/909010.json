{"id": "909010", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe jury found by their verdict that the legacies had never been paid, and this rebutted any presumption of payment arising from lapse of time. As the will expressly charged the legacies upon the property in question \u201cuntil paid,\u201d they necessarily remain a lien until actual payment has been made. We discover no error in the record and the assignments of error are all dismissed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant."}
