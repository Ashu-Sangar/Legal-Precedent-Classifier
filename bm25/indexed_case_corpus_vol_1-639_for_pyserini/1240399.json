{"id": "1240399", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThis is an appeal by the Commonwealth from an order of the court of common pleas setting aside a suspension by the Secretary of Revenue of an operator\u2019s license for operating a motor vehicle. The offense charged was speed on a public highway at eighty miles per hour where the maximum lawful speed was fifty miles per hour.\nWhat we said in Commonwealth v. Emerick, 373 Pa. 388, 96 A. 2d 370, relating to legal principles and the construction of The Vehicle Code has similar application to the facts in the present case.\nRobert McCullough, defendant, was charged by a state policeman with traveling, on April 18, 1952, on a public highway at eighty miles per hour at 11:50 p.m. It was testified that defendant drove through a thirty-five-mile-an-hour restricted speed zone at fifty to fifty-five miles per hour. He was followed by the policeman for four or five miles, during which period defendant was \u201cclocked\u201d speeding at eighty miles per hour. Defendant did not deny the charge, although he \u201cthought\u201d that he had not exceeded the speed limit in the restricted zone. This was defendant\u2019s second speeding offense. The learned hearing judge decided, solely because of economic hardship, that the suspension of the operator\u2019s license by the Secretary of Revenue should be revoked and the license restored. In the order the court said: . . it appearing to the Court that the [defendant] is employed by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad as a telegraph operator in their Pittsburgh office, that there is no public transportation facilities available to take him to and from his home and place of employment, that no other members of the petitioner\u2019s family can drive for him, that there is no one in his community with whom he might ride, that it would be impossible for him to take care of his work during the time when his license would be suspended and that he has no other source of income or means of earning his livelihood and that the suspension of his operator\u2019s privileges would result in irreparable loss to him, the Order of the Secretary of Revenue suspending the operator\u2019s privileges of the petitioner is hereby set aside and the operator\u2019s privileges restored to Robert McCullough.\u201d\nSuch order constitutes a manifest abuse of discretion by the court below.\nThe order is reversed at the cost of appellee."}
