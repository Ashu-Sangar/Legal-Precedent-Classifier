{"id": "4184321", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 25th day of November, 2014, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED. The issues, as stated by petitioner, are:\n(1) Whether the Commonwealth Court erred when it held that FT Holdings\u2019 objection to standing was untimely and the issue of standing was waived where, pursuant to the Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court holding Spahn v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 602 Pa. 83, 977 A.2d 1132 (2009), standing to appear before the SBA is fundamentally different than standing to appeal a [Board] decision to the Court of Common Pleas and the issue of standing was, therefore, timely raised by FT Holdingfs\u2019] Motion to Quash.\n(2) Whether, pursuant to the Pennsylvania\u2019s Supreme Court\u2019s holding in Spahn v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 602 Pa. 83, 977 A.2d 1132 (2009), John Scott lacks standing to appeal the decision of the Philadelphia Zoning Board of Adjustment and, as a result, the trial court properly dismissed his appeal with prejudice."}
