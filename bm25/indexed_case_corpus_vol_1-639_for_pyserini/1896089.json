{"id": "1896089", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThis case arises out of a dispute between Berks County Tuberculosis Society, appellant, and Reading-Berks Tuberculosis and Health Association, appellee, each of which claims that it is the income beneficiary under a provision of an inter vivos trust known as \u201cThe Musser-Custer Memorial Fund.\u201d The trust instrument, dated April 29, 1943, contained provisions for the distribution of certain income from the corpus of the trust in designated percentages to fifteen charitable organizations. Each party here claims that it is the beneficiary under the paragraph which gives \u201cSix per cent (6%) thereof to The Tuberculosis Society of Berks County, of Reading, Pennsylvania.\u201d\nThe court below concluded: \u201cThere is no organization in existence which meets the exact measure or name as used by the Settlors of the trust. There is a latent ambiguity in the instrument as to whom the Settlors intended to receive 6 per cent of the income from the trust.\u201d Finding that there was a latent ambiguity, the court received evidence of settlors\u2019 intent to assist it in determining the identity of the beneficiary. After making findings of fact and conclusions of law, the court held that the intended beneficiary was Reading-Berks Tuberculosis and Health Association. Following the filing of exceptions and absolute confirmation of the decree nisi, Berks County Tuberculosis Society filed this appeal.\nThe decree of the court below must be reversed. Although appellant\u2019s correct name is \u201cBerks County Tuberculosis Society\u201d and not \u201cTuberculosis Society of Berks County\u201d, it is possible to determine the identity of the beneficiary with certainty from the language of the trust instrument without resort to extrinsic evidence of the settlors\u2019 intent. We have stated repeatedly that extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove intent when the beneficiary designation in the instrument specifies a recipient with sufficient exactitude to clearly indicate a person or organization legally qualified to take. E.g., Houston Estate, 414 Pa. 579, 201 A. 2d 592 (1964); Beisgen Estate, 387 Pa. 425, 128 A. 2d 52 (1956); Logan v. Wiley, 357 Pa. 547, 55 A. 2d 366 (1947); Wusthoff v. Dracourt, 3 Watts 240 (Pa. 1834) . Although the settlor may actually have intended to benefit some other recipient, evidence of that fact is inadmissible if the designation in the trust instrument identifies with clarity another recipient. It is not required that the designation conform in every minute detail to the name of a person or organization. This is particularly so when a corporate or organizational name is involved. Lockwood\u2019s Estate, 344 Pa. 293, 25 A. 2d 168 (1942). It is only necessary that the designation unambiguously identify a subject to which the terms of the trust are obviously applicable.\nAdmission of evidence to show the intent of the settlor is the exception and not the rule for the sound reason that the writing itself must be considered to be the best and controlling evidence of the settlor\u2019s intent. See Sowers Estate, 383 Pa. 566, 119 A. 2d 60 (1956).\nThe trust instrument here specifies the beneficiary as \u201cThe Tuberculosis Society of Berks County, of Reading, Pennsylvania.\u201d At the time the trust was created both appellant and appellee were functioning organizations. As we have already noted, appellee\u2019s name was Reading Tuberculosis Association at all times relevant-to the execution of the instruments in litigation.' Appellant\u2019s name was, and still is, Berks County Tuberculosis Society. .We conclude that the trust.instrument identifies appellant with clarity as the object of the settlors\u2019 bounty.\nAlthough appellee bases part of its argument for finding an ambiguity on the fact that appellant\u2019s name,-. \u201cBerks- County Tuberculosis Society\u201d, does not precisely coincide with the full designation in the trust instrument of \u201cThe Tuberculosis Society of Berks County, of Reading, Pennsylvania,\u201d much of the difference-between those two appellations is readily explained by an examination of the trust instrument, itself. In the section of the instrument in which settlors dispose of income from the trust corpus there are fifteen designated beneficiaries, all of whose names are preceded by \u201cThe\u201d. It is obvious that this was a stylistic characteristic of the scrivener which assumes no importance in identifying the. beneficiary.'.\n, A reading of the instrument also amply demonstrates that the phrase \u201cof Reading, Pennsylvania\u2019\u2019following the beneficiary\u2019s name was not intended to be part of the name but was added merely to provide geographical identification. This conclusion is compelled by the fact that, of the fifteen beneficiaries indicated' in the pertinent section, a geographical identification is annexed to thirteen of the named beneficiaries and the phrase \u201cof Reading, Pennsylvania\u201d is annexed to twelve of those.\nThe question narrows, therefore, to whether \u201cTuberculosis Society of Berks County\u201d identifies with sufficient certainty \u201cBerks County Tuberculosis Society\u201d. In our view, neither the inversion of \u201cBerks County\u201d and \u201cTuberculosis Society\u201d nor the facts and circumstances relied upon by appellee are sufficient to create an ambiguity in the beneficiary designation which would warrant the introduction of parol evidence to show the settlors\u2019 intent.\nDecree reversed; distribution to be made in accordance with this opinion. Each party to pay own costs.\nAppellee adopted its present name in 1952. In 1943, when the trust instrument was executed, and in 1943, 1950 and 1951, when it was amended, appellee\u2019s name was Heading Tuberculosis Association.\nThe trust provided for the accumulation of income and its addition to principal during the lives of the two settlors and the husband of one of them. All three have died and the annual income is now distributable. The issue was raised upon the filing of the account and presentation of a petition for adjudication by the surviving trustee, Girard Trust Corn Exchange Bank. At the audit, the trustee advised the court of the respective claims of the Society and the Association.\nAlthough the trust instrument was amended in 1943, 1950 and 1951, none of those amendments affects the beneficiary designation now in question except the 1951 amendment, which merely restates the contested name.\nAlthough we rely upon cases which concern the proper interpretation of wills, the principles enunciated in those cases ar)ply with equal validity in this situation to the interpretation of the trust instrument. Pew Trust, 411 Pa. 96, 106-07, 191 A. 2d 399, 405 (1983); see Erny Trust, 415 Pa. 8, 202 A. 2d 30 (1964).\nEvidence of extrinsic facts and circumstances is admissible to show that an ambiguity exists, Herr Estate, 400 Pa. 90, 161 A. 2d 32 (1960); Metzger\u2019s Estate, 222 Pa. 276, 71 Atl. 96 (1908), but we find appellee\u2019s evidence unpersuasive in that regard.\nThe two beneficiaries not identified geographically were the Salvation Army and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania.With regard to the former, it was directed that the money so received should be used'in its work in Beading, Pennsylvania."}
