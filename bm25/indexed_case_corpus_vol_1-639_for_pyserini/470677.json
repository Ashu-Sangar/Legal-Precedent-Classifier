As there is no statute authorizing an appeal from such an interlocutory order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, the appeal must be quashed.\nThe terms of the Act of June 24, 1895, P. L. 243, 12 PS 1104, amended by the Act of March 30, 1921, P. L. 60, allowing appeals from orders to account, are limited to such orders made by courts of common pleas, and do not include orphans\u2019 court orders.\nAppeal quashed."}
