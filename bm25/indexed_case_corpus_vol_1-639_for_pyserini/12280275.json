{"id": "12280275", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 15th day of March, 2016, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED. The issue, as stated by Petitioner, is:\nDid the General Assembly, when it gave Philadelphia general police powers as expansive as [those] of the General Assembly and specific authority to enact local anti-discrimination laws, intend to exempt SEPTA from compliance with those laws, when the consequence of compliance would not materially disrupt SEPTA\u2019s core transportation function and the consequence of non-compliance would leave hundreds of thousands of Philadelphia passengers and employees without a remedy against many forms of discrimination?\nJustice EAKIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter."}
