Whether the Commonwealth Court erred in holding that a municipality which, under its zoning ordinance, provides for the reasonable development of minerals within its municipality, is, nevertheless, mandated to use verbatim the definition of minerals employed in the MPC, precluding the reasonable differentiation of the various types of minerals[?]\nThe Department of Environmental Protection is invited to file an amicus brief addressing its understanding of the preemptive scope of the Act and the Department\u2019s associated administrative regulations with regard to oil and gas well siting."}
