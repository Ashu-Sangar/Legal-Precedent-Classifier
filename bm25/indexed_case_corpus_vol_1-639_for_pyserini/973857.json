{"id": "973857", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThese appeals are from decrees continuing, until further order of the court, preliminary injunctions restraining the defendant from interfering with the connection of the tracks of the plaintiff\u2019s road with its own and from entering on the plaintiff\u2019s right of way. They relate to the same subject-matter and were argued together. Apparently there was sufficient ground for the action of the court in awarding the \u00ednj\u00fanction and there is no reason why this court should depart from the established practice not to consider the merits until the cases are presented after final hearing in the common pleas.\nThe appeals are dismissed."}
