{"id": "866851", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nTo have directed a verdict for the defendant company, as requested in its 11th point, would have been manifest error. The testimony tending to prove that defendant\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury was quite sufficient to not only carry the case to the jury, but to justify them in finding as they did. The case was carefully and ably tried. There appears to be nothing whatever in the record to justify a reversal of the judgment.\nJudgment affirmed."}
