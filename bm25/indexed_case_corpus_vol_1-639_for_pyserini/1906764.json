{"id": "1906764", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThis appeal involves the validity of an antenuptial agreement signed by the decedent, Edward H. Gelb, and his widow, Fannie Bazrod Gelb, on March 24, 1960, three days before their marriage. At the time of their marriage Mr. Gelb, then 67, and Mrs. Gelb, 64, both had adult children from prior marriages. By the terms of the agreement each party renounced his interest in the estate of the other, and Mrs. Gelb received $15,000 in cash. The parties lived together harmoniously from the date of their marriage until the husband\u2019s death on June 6, 1963.\nOn February 28, 1964, Mrs. Gelb filed an election to take against her husband\u2019s will; the executors filed a petition to vacate this election. Following a hearing at which the validity of the antenuptial agreement was the sole issue, the auditing judge permitted the widow to take against the will because he found the evidence \u201cconvincingly establishes\u201d that: \u201c(1) the decedent materially misrepresented to Fannie Bazrod the value of his estate at the time he induced her to execute the antenuptial agreement; (2) Fannie Bazrod executed the antenuptial agreement in reliance upon the representations which Edward H. Gelb made to her.\u201d Exceptions were taken and the matter argued before the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County en banc. That court unanimously affirmed the auditing judge\u2019s adjudication, Gelb Estate, 38 Pa. D. & C. 2d 203 (Phila. O. C. 1966), and this appeal followed.\nAppellants attack the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s decision on two theories. Belying upon the parol evidence rule and the Dead Man\u2019s Statute, they argue that the testimony of Harry B. Berk, Esq., scrivener of the ante-nuptial agreement, and Mrs. Gelb, should not have been received. They also maintain that in any event the antenuptial agreement is valid and binding because there is no showing of a lack of adequate provision for the widow. We shall consider the evidentiary questions raised first.\nWith respect to Mr. Berk, appellant\u2019s parol evidence objection is based upon the clause in the ante-nuptial agreement stating that the value of the husband\u2019s property had been fully disclosed to the intended wife. Because of the confidential relationship existing between parties to an antenuptial agreement, which requires from each the highest degree of good faith, such a declaration is only prima facie evidence, rebuttable by extrinsic evidence, Snyder Estate, 375 Pa. 185, 188, 100 A. 2d 67, 68 (1953); McClellan Estate, 365 Pa. 401, 406, 75 A. 2d 595, 597 (1950). Accordingly, under the parol evidence rule, Mr. Berk\u2019s testimony was properly admitted to substantiate claimant\u2019s allegations of material misrepresentation contained in her answer to the petition to strike the election. Myers v. Rubin, 399 Pa. 363, 366-67, 160 A. 2d 559, 561 (1960) ; LaCourse v. Kiesel, 366 Pa. 385, 390-91, 77 A. 2d 877, 880-81 (1951). Whether Mr. Berk\u2019s testimony supports the conclusion of the court below that there was clear and convincing evidence of misrepresentation, see Palone v. Moschetta, 387 Pa. 386, 392, 128 A. 2d 37, 10 (1956), is not, in this context, relevant to the question of its admissibility.\nOne of the conditions which must be met before a witness can be properly disqualified under the Dead Man\u2019s Statute is that the interest of the witness, not simply his testimony, be adverse to the decedent. Hendrickson Estate, 388 Pa. 39, 45, 130 A. 2d 143, 146-47 (1957). Even if we were to accept exceptant\u2019s assumption that Mr. Berk was receiving a fee as \u201cco-counsel\u201d, an assumption not supported by the record, such an interest would not render him incompetent but would merely affect his credibility. In order to be adverse the interest must be one from which the witness will either gain or lose as the direct legal operation and effect of the judgment. Commonwealth Trust Co. v. Szabo, 391 Pa. 272, 281-82, 138 A. 2d 85, 89 (1957); Gaston Estate, 361 Pa. 105, 62 A. 2d 904 (1949); Dillon\u2019s Estate, 269 Pa. 234, 111 Atl. 919 (1920). For example in Gaston Estate, supra, we held that a guardian was a competent witness even though Ms commissions would be increased, if his contention on behalf of his minor wards was successful.\nWhen Mrs. Gelb was called, exceptants objected to her testifying under the Dead Man\u2019s Statute. Claimant agrees that she was initially incompetent to testify, Snyder Estate, 375 Pa. 185, 100 A. 2d 67 (1953), but views her testimony as coming within the ambit of the Act of June 11, 1891, P. L. 287, \u00a71, 28 P.S. \u00a7325. Under this exception to the Dead Man\u2019s Statute when the party representing the decedent calls a witness who testifies adversely to the interests of the surviving party about a transaction which occurred in the presence of the survivor and the witness, the surviving party is rendered competent to testify in contradiction of said witness. Commonwealth Trust Co. v. Szabo, 391 Pa. 272, 283-84, 138 A. 2d 85, 90 (1957); Bowman\u2019s Estate, 301 Pa. 337, 342-43, 152 Atl. 38, 40 (1930). We are fully satisfied that the auditing judge was aware of the limitations placed upon Mrs. Gelb\u2019s ability to testify and that he properly limited her to relevant matters concerning conversations which actually took place in her presence and about which there had been previous adverse testimony. See Bowman\u2019s Estate, supra.\nWe turn next to a consideration of the validity of the antenuptial agreement itself. While antenuptial agreements are presumptively valid, they, nevertheless, depend upon there being either a reasonable provision made for the wife, or, in the absence of such a provision, a full and fair disclosure to the wife of the husband\u2019s worth. Kaufmann Estate, 404 Pa. 131, 136, 171 A. 2d 48, 50 (1961). When the person attacking the agreement has shown that it was made on the basis of material misrepresentations, it will be presumed that the contract was entered in reliance upon these misrepresentations and the burden to prove otherwise is cast upon the party seeking to uphold the agreement. McClellan Estate, 365 Pa. 401, 75 A. 2d 595 (1950).\nAs the following excerpts from the opinion of the Philadelphia orphans\u2019 court en banc demonstrate, the exceptants, in light of these misrepresentations, failed to show that a reasonable provision had been made for the wife: \u201cHarry B. Berk, Esq., scrivener of the antenuptial agreement, testified that decedent stated to him in claimant\u2019s presence that his assets were of a value \u2018in the neighborhood of about $100,000\u2019. This is the same amount that claimant had informed Mr. Berk that decedent had disclosed to her before she and decedent consulted him about the agreement. Mr. Berk urged decedent to give him a written statement of his assets to attach to the antenuptial agreement. When decedent refused to do this, he advised claimant that she would have to rely on decedent\u2019s stated valuation of his assets, and he warned decedent that if this statement of Ms assets tvere inaccurate, this might cause the antenuptial agreement to he set aside. Notwithstanding this warning, decedent again refused to set forth his assets in writing, and reiterated that although he had not disclosed to his intended wife \u2018the nature of his estate\u2019, it was worth $100,000 and \u2018maybe it might be worth $125,000\u2019. In fact, Ms assets at this time were valued at $263,711, and his daughter, Mrs. Katz, testified that she believed they were then worth $300,000.\n\u201cIn short, decedent deliberately and grossly understated his assets to claimant as an inducement to her to sign the antenuptial agreement. Claimant relied upon decedent\u2019s statement of his assets in executing this agreement. There is no credible evidence to show that claimant had knowledge that his assets were greater than then stated by him. Exceptants produced many witnesses and much vague, general testimony to indicate that claimant knew decedent had assets more valuable than those he disclosed to her. The auditing judge did not believe this evidence; nor do we. Moreover, such testimony is not sufficient to show knowledge upon the part of claimant which is contrary to decedent\u2019s statement of his assets at the time of the execution of the agreement: Kline v. Kline, 57 Pa. 120.\n\u201cWhether claimant would have accepted the $15,000 decedent gave her, if she had known the true value of his estate at the time the antenuptial contract was executed, is not for us to conjecture. Suffice it to say, she relied upon his statement of his assets. Furthermore, in our opinion, $15,000 is not a proper settlement for a widow who has lived with her husband in her own home for three years, when his estate at the time of marriage and death was in excess of $260,000. Therefore, the antenuptial agreement is voidable: Kaufmann Estate, 404 Pa. 131.\n\u201cSignificantly, the widow is very poorly educated. She testified on cross-examination: \u2018I can read a little bit. I went to night school for a few seasons\u2019. Moreover, she testified that she did not understand ante-nuptial contracts. But she signed this agreement because decedent wanted her to do so and told her that it ivas good for both of them. She completely relied upon decedent\u2019s representations. Mr. Berk testified: \u2018I merely asked her if she knew of her intended husband\u2019s assets, and she said only from what he told her; and that she Avas taking his word for it\u2019.\n\u201cPennsylvania has always carefully protected the rights of a Avidow in her husband\u2019s estate, particularly, as in this case, where the husband and wife have lived harmoniously together for years prior to the death of the husband. Therefore, a strong burden was placed upon decedent, who requested his intended wife to re nounce all of her widow\u2019s rights, to make a full and complete disclosure of his assets: McClellan Estate, 365 Pa. 401. Decedent did not do this. In fact, he deliberately refused to make a written statement of his assets, and orally stated that his assets were less than one-half what they actually were. It follows that the antenuptial agreement Avas voidable. Hence, the AvidoAV is entitled to take against the will and to receive her share of decedent\u2019s estate given to her by the Intestate Act.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Gelb Estate, 38 Pa. D. & C. 2d 203, 205-07 (Phila. O. C. 1966).\nThe credibility of the witnesses and the weight to be given their testimony is in the first instance to be determined by the auditing judge. His findings of fact, affirmed by the court en banc, like those of a jury, are conclusive unless they are unsupportable by the record. Collings Estate, 405 Pa. 280, 282, 175 A. 2d 62, 63 (1961); Pavlinko Estate, 399 Pa. 536, 541, 160 A. 2d 554, 557 (1960); Hanna Estate, 383 Pa. 196, 199, 117 A. 2d 730, 732 (1955). The factual conclusions quoted above are amply supported by the record and the application of these facts to the law is in accord with our decisions.\nDecree affirmed. Costs on the Estate.\nOriginally Mr. Gelb had proposed to give Mrs. Bazrod $25,-000, but, after consulting members of his family, reduced the amount to $15,000.\nThe court en banc did make one change in the initial adjudication when it ordered the $15,000 consideration received by Mrs. Gelb to be credited to ber portion of the distributive share of the estate. This was done with the auditing judge\u2019s express approval.\nAct of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, \u00a75(e), 28 P.S. \u00a7322.\nBecause of Mr. Berk\u2019s illness, the court convened at his apartment for the purpose of taking his testimony, where he was subjected to lengthy direct and cross-examination. No objection was entered with respect to his testimony until the next hearing a month later. Hence the failure to object would be an alternative ground for sustaining the ruling of the auditing judge. See McGary Estate, 355 Pa. 232, 236, 49 A. 2d 350, 352 (1946); Hughes v. Bailey, 202 Pa. Superior Ct. 263, 267-68, 195 A. 2d 281, 283-84 (1963).\n\u201cHereafter in any civil proceeding before any tribunal of this Commonwealth . . . although a party to the thing or contract in action may be dead . . . nevertheless any surviving or remaining party to such thing or contract or any other person whose interest is adverse to the said right of such deceased or lunatic party, shall be a competent witness to any relevant matter, although it may have occurred before the death of said party or the adjudication of his lunacy, if and only if such relevant matter occurred between himself and another person who may be living at the time of the trial and may be competent to testify, and who does so testify upon the trial against such surviving or remaining party or against the person whose interest may be thus adverse, or if such relevant matter occurred in the presence or hearing of such other living or competent person.\u201d Act of June 11, 1891, P. P. 287, \u00a71.\nAppellants also contend that they did not receive a fair hearing below because the auditing judge suggested to claimant\u2019s counsel that Mrs. Gelb be called after counsel had initially rested his case. There is no merit in this contention. Weiss Will, 366 Pa. 456, 458-59, 77 A. 2d 422, 423 (1951) ; Gerlach Estate, 364 Pa. 207, 214-15, 72 A. 2d 271, 275 (1950). Nor is there any merit in the suggestion that the auditing judge was an advocate for claimant rather than an impartial trier of facts.\nThe reasonableness of the provision, which is viewed from the date of the agreement, depends upon the particular circumstances of each case. Among the various factors to be considered are: (a) the financial worth of the husband; (b) the financial status of the wife; (c) the age of the parties and the number of children each has; (d) the intelligence of the parties; (e) whether the wife aided in the accumulation of the wealth. See Kaufmann Estate, 404 Pa. 131, 137, 171 A. 2d 48, 51 (1961), and cases cited therein."}
