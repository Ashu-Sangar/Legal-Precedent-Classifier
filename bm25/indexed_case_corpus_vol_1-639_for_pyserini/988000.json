Justice Dean,\nEvery question of merit raised by this appeal has been passed on in Du Bois\u2019s Appeal from the same decree, in which opinion has been handed down this day, ante, p. 329. The finding of fact by the auditing judge was sustained in that case. This disposes of appellant\u2019s complaint that he should have been allowed for the price of the lumber delivered after August 24, 1895.\nThe decree is affirmed and the appeal is dismissed at costs of appellant."}
