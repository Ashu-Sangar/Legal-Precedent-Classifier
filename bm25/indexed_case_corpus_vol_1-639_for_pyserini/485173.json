{"id": "485173", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court dismissing Bethlehem Mines Corporation\u2019s petition for a writ of prohibition against appellees, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Maurice K. Goddard, Secretary of the Department of Environmental Resources, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and Robert Broughton, Paul E. Waters, and Gerald H. Goldberg, individually, and as members of the Environmental Hearing Board, Department of Environmental Resources, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The appellant\u2019s petition in the Commonwealth Court requested that a writ of prohibition issue to prevent the Environmental Hearing Board from proceeding with a scheduled reargument of a matter involving the appellant. In dismissing appellant\u2019s petition, the Commonwealth Court held that it did not have statutory authority to issue the writ. The Commonwealth Court therefore did not reach the merits of the controversy. This appeal followed.\nWe agree with the Commonwealth Court that it may issue a writ of prohibition only if authority to do so has been statutorily granted. Akron Borough v. Penna. P. U. C., 453 Pa. 554, 310 A.2d 271 (1973); Carbon County v. Leibensperger, 439 Pa. 138, 266 A.2d 632 (1970); Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. Butz, 411 Pa. 360, 192 A.2d 707 (1963). We conclude, however, that the order of the Commonwealth Court dismissing appellant\u2019s writ of prohibition must be reversed because the Commonwealth Court is authorized by statute to issue writs of prohibition.\nThe Commonwealth Court Act, Act of January 6, 1970, P.L. (1969) 434, \u00a7 8(g), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.8(g), authorizes the issuance of writs necessary or suitable for the exercise of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s jurisdiction:\n\u201cThe court shall have power to issue, under its judicial seal, every lawful writ and process necessary or suitable for the exercise of the jurisdiction given by this act . . . .\u201d\nThere is no dispute that the Commonwealth Court has jurisdiction to hear appeals from the Environmental Hearing Board, the tribunal against which the writ of prohibition is sought. See Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, art. IV, \u00a7 401, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.401. Since the Commonwealth Court has jurisdiction over appeals from the Environmental Hearing Board, and since it is authorized to issue every lawful writ necessary or suitable for the exercise of its jurisdiction, we conclude that the Commonwealth Court has the authority to issue a writ of prohibition.\nWere there any doubt about the statutory authority granted in subsection 8(g) of the Commonwealth Court Act, that doubt vanishes after a reading of subsection 8(h) of that Act. Subsection 8(h), not referred to in the Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion provides that the Commonwealth Court shall have \u201call powers necessary or appropriate in aid of its appellate jurisdiction which are agreeable to the usages and principles of law.\u201d The \u201call powers necessary or appropriate\u201d granted to the Commonwealth Court in subsection 8(h) are to be used \u201cin aid of its appellate jurisdiction.\u201d The language \u201cin aid of its appellate jurisdiction\u201d is identical to language quoted with approval in Carpentertown Coal & Coke Co. v. Laird, 360 Pa. 94, 101, 61 A.2d 426, 429 (1948), when referring to the purpose for which a court issues a writ of prohibition. As we said in Carpentertown Coal & Coke Co., the writ of prohibition is precisely the kind of writ that a court might issue to protect its appellate jurisdiction. It is \u201ca means by which a court protects its appellate jurisdiction and may therefore be regarded as a writ ancillary to the exercise to such jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 100, 61 A.2d at 429. Moreover, there is no indication in the Commonwealth Court Act that the language \u201cevery lawful writ\u201d does not include a writ of prohibition, and we cannot read such an exception into the legislative enactment.\nThe appellees argue that the provisions of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, which was enacted subsequent to the above cited Commonwealth Court Act, indicate that the legislature did not intend to grant to the Commonwealth Court statutory authority to issue writs of prohibition. We cannot agree. The Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970 specifically repealed the first six paragraphs, designated(a) through (f), of Section 8 of the Commonwealth Court Act, but did not repeal subsections 8(g) or 8(h). Act of July 3, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223 art. V, \u00a7 509, as amended 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.-509(a) (7). It is these latter subsections, as we have noted, that grant broad statutory authority to the Commonwealth Court.\nThe appellees also argue that the Commonwealth Court has no authority to issue writs of prohibition because the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970 expressly granted the authority to issue writs of prohibition to the Superior Court but was silent about the authority of the Commonwealth Court to issue such writs. See and compare Section 301 with Section 401. (17 P.S. \u00a7 211.301 and \u00a7 211.401). Assuming for the moment that the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act is silent on this point, we can hardly read such silence as indicating a legislative intent to deny authority to the Commonwealth Court to issue writs of prohibition. This is particularly true in view of the legislative action of retaining subsections 8(g) and 8(h) of the Commonwealth Court Act, while repealing subsections 8(a) through 8(f). Such silence, if its exists, may well have resulted from the legislature\u2019s belief that broad authority existed in the unrepealed subsections 8(g) and 8(h).\nWe do not agree, however, that the Appellate' Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970 is any more silent on this point than it is concerning the statutory authority of the Superior Court.\nSection 401 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act provides:\n\u201c(a) The Commonwealth Court shall have original jurisdiction of:\n(1) All civil actions or proceedings against the Commonwealth or any officer thereof, acting in his official capacity, except (i) actions or proceedings in the nature of applications for a writ of habeas corpus or post conviction relief not ancillary to proceedings within the appellate jurisdiction of the court, . . ..\u201d (17 P.S. \u00a7 211.401)\nThe phrase \u201coriginal jurisdiction ... of all civil actions or proceedings\u201d is broad and all inclusive. It includes jurisdiction to issue writs of prohibition directed to administrative tribunals of the Commonwealth without expressly mentioning them. The broad nature of this grant obviates the need for specific mention of the writ of prohibition.\nThis conclusion is corroborated by the two specific exceptions that are noted. The first exception recognizes that the scope of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s jurisdiction is broad enough to include the issuance of writs of habeas corpus, or proceedings in the nature of post conviction relief, when they are ancillary to its appellate jurisdiction. If, as urged by appellees, the General Assembly had intended to exclude writs of prohibition, mandamus, and quo warranto from the Commonwealth\u2019s jurisdiction, it could have done so in the same manner that proceedings in the nature of applications for writ of habeas corpus or post conviction relief were excluded.\nAppellees refer to Section 301 as an example of an express enumeration of the power to issue writs of mandamus and prohibition. Section 301 provides that the Superior Court:\n\u201cshall have no original jurisdiction, except in actions of mandamus and prohibition to courts of inferior jurisdiction where such actions are ancillary to matters within its appellate jurisdiction . . .\u201d\n(17 P.S. \u00a7 211.301).\nContrary to appellees\u2019 claim, the reference to mandamus and prohibition in this Section is not an enumeration of powers to be exercised by the Superior Court, but a recitation of two exceptions to the proposition that the Superior Court \u201cshall have no original jurisdiction.\u201d Without expression of these exceptions, the words \u201cno original jurisdiction\u201d would have precluded the Superior Court from exercising original jurisdiction in actions of mandamus or prohibition. Since the General Assembly provided a broad grant of original jurisdiction to the Commonwealth Court in Section 401, it would have been superfluous to refer specifically to its original jurisdiction over writs of prohibition, mandamus, and quo warranto.\nThe appellees also rely upon this Court\u2019s decision in Collins v. Gessler, 452 Pa. 471, 307 A.2d 892 (1973). Collins, however, is inapposite. In Collins, we held that because the Supreme Court had sole authority to consolidate magisterial districts and eliminate an existing office of justice of the peace, the Commonwealth Court did not have jurisdiction in an action of quo warranto involving a district justice of the peace. Collins should not be read to deny jurisdiction to the Commonwealth Court in all cases in which this Court has original jurisdiction. Section 201 of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act gives the Supreme Court \u201coriginal but not exclusive\u201d jurisdiction in cases of prohibition to courts of inferior jurisdiction. (17 P.S. \u00a7 211.201). In Collins, the conclusion that our jurisdiction in that action of quo warranto was original and exclusive was based not on a statutory grant of original jurisdiction, but on our constitutional authority over justices of the peace.\nWe have considered the other arguments raised and find them to be without merit.\nIn deciding that the Commonwealth Court has been granted statutory authority to issue writs of prohibition in certain cases, we do not, of course, decide whether the writ should be issued in this case. The Commonwealth Court did not reach this question and neither do we. Since appellant\u2019s petition for a writ of prohibition was improperly dismissed, we remand the case to the Commonwealth Court for a determination on the merits.\nOrder reversed and case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nJONES, C. J., filed a dissenting opinion in which EAGEN and O\u2019BRIEN, JJ., joined."}
