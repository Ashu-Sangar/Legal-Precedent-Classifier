{"id": "1938559", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Eagen,\nFollowing the fatal shooting of Dennis C. Evans on a public street in the City of Reading, Thomas Andrea Crowder was arrested and indicted for murder. At trial, the accused pled self-defense. The jury returned a verdict of guilty of voluntary manslaughter. From the judgment of sentence imposed by the court following the denial of a new trial, Crowder filed this appeal.\nThe sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the conviction is not questioned, but it is urged that certain errors occurred at trial which violated constitutional due process and a new trial should be ordered. We have studied each asserted assignment of error in connection with the trial record and find nothing of such consequence to warrant disturbing the judgment entered below. We will, therefore, affirm. Our discussion here, however, will be limited to what may be described as the major assignments of error.\nAppellant contends that the procedure employed by the trial court in calling jurors for examination on voir dire denied him the same opportunity as that afforded the Commonwealth of selecting a fair and impartial jury. The facts in connection with this are these.\nAfter the entire panel of jurors summoned for service at the particular session of court was assembled in the \u201cjury selection room\u201d, the names of thirty-five thereof were drawn by lot and these jurors were immediately sent to the courtroom where Crowder\u2019s case was to be called for trial. A list of the names of these jurors in the order drawn was then supplied to counsel and each juror was called for voir dire examination in the same order as previously drawn. Crowder\u2019s counsel objected because this permitted the attorneys to \u201cknow in advance exactly which jurors are coming up next\u201d and permitted them \u201cto sit back and wait for a juror to come up.\u201d The gravamen of this complaint, as stated in appellant\u2019s brief, is that because of Crowder\u2019s indigency this procedure allowed the Commonwealth \u201cwith all the resources ... at its disposal to investigate in order the jurors on the list.\u201d\nWe fail to discern how the procedure complained of gave the Commonwealth any unfair advantage. Moreover, it is not asserted that it resulted in an unfair jury being impanelled and there is nothing in the record to warrant such a conclusion. Under the circumstances, this assignment of error is devoid of merit.\nThe Constitution of Pennsylvania, Art. I, \u00a76, guarantees that \u201c[tjrial by jury shall be as heretofore, and the right thereof remain inviolate.\u201d This does not \u201cimport rigidity of regulation in the manner of impanelling a jury,\u201d Commonwealth v. Fugmann, 330 Pa. 4, 28-29, 198 A. 99, 111 (1938). See also Commonwealth v. Eckhart, 430 Pa. 311, 242 A. 2d 271 (1968). The voir dire examination is merely a means to the end of achieving an impartial jury. And if the procedure utilized in effecting this examination does not substantially impair the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury, his rights are not violated. No such impairment occurred here.\nIn the selection of the first twelve members of the jury, Crowder exercised only five peremptory challenges of the twenty permitted. During the selection of the alternate jurors, Ms counsel insisted that he was entitled to exercise the fifteen not yet used, plus one. The court ruled otherwise. The controlling statute, the Act of May 1, 1935, P. L. 127, \u00a71, 17 P.S. 1153, provides that \u201c[wjhere the court allows two alternate jurors in accordance with this act, each side shall have one additional peremptory challenge in the selection of said two alternative jurors.\u201d TMs does not mean that the challenges available during the selection of the first twelve jurors which are not exercised remain viable during the selection of the alternate jurors. Also, the fact that in the trial of other cases, the court involved permitted more peremptory challenges in the selection of alternate jurors than specified by the Act of 1935, supra (an assertion by appellant which is not supported by the record) did not vest Crowder with any such right.\nWithin twenty minutes after the shooting involved, Crowder was taken into police custody and a revolver was found concealed on his person. Upon being taken to police headquarters, he admitted ownership of the gun. After a \u201cJackson-Denno\u201d hearing conducted in the absence of the jury, the trial court found that this admission was made voluntarily, and after Crowder had been warned and was aware of his constitutional rights, as required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966). It is now contended that the warmngs given were inadequate and that, even if thip is not so, the evidence does not support the court\u2019s finding that Crowder understood his rights. After reading the record, we disagree.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Roberts concurs in the result.\nRule 1108 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure was not involved in the disposition of this case, since trial occurred before the effective date of said Rule."}
