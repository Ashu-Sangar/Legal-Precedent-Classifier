{"id": "1221643", "contents": "Opinion\nper Curiam,\nPlaintiffs brought an action in trespass against the defendants, public carriers, to recover damages for the injuries sustained by Anna A. Olsavsky on July 14, 1947, when as a passenger on a bus owned by the defendants the heel of the shoe on her right foot caught in a hole in the steel plate on the floor of the bus between the fare box and the door and catapulted her from the bus to the street. She sustained injuries to her knees, shoulders, back, left thumb and a tearing of the abdomen on the right side.\nAfter trial the jury returned a verdict in the sum of $8,000 for the wife and the sum of $5,000 for the husband. Counsel for the defendants moved for judgment n. o. v. and a new trial and assigned eight reasons for a new trial, among which was: \u201c8. Counsel for the plaintiffs, in this closing argument, so prejudiced the cause of the defendants with the jury by improper argument beyond the scope of the evidence and the inferenees to be drawn therefrom that the case should have been continued in harmony with the plea and motion of the defendants.\u201d\nAt one of the recesses during the trial the judge asked the defendants\u2019 counsel, in the presence of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, if he, defendants\u2019 counsel, proposed to move for a compulsory non-suit. Defendants\u2019 counsel indicated that he did not intend to do so. This was in the judge\u2019s chambers. In a final summation plaintiffs\u2019 counsel commented on the fact that such an incident took place. These remarks were allegedly to the effect, \u201cThe Judge said, \u2018You are not going to file a motion for compulsory nonsuit in view of this evidence.\u2019 \u201d Defendants\u2019 counsel now argue that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel in making the statement gave the jury \u201cthe Trial Judge\u2019s supposed evaluation of the evidence.\u201d Defendants\u2019 counsel moved the Court to withdraw a juror on account of the alleged prejudicial remarks. This motion was refused. In his opinion ordering a new trial the judge said: \u201cHow prejudicial this unfortuitous but unintentional remark of counsel for plaintiff may have been we are unable to determine. It may have had considerable influence on the jury, which deliberated from 2:15 p. m., when it retired, to 11:00 p. m. on February 18, 1949, either on the matter of liability or the matter of damages.\u201d\nThe court then ordered a new trial because of these remarks, stating: \u201cThe sole ground for granting this new trial is the unfortunate remark of Counsel for plaintiffs in his summation to the jury, and in granting this new trial it is not to be construed that he is being criticized in the circumstances.\u201d\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the action of the court in granting a new trial. It was highly improper for plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to reveal to the jury what took place between opposing counsel and the Trial Judge in the privacy of the judge\u2019s chambers. It is well for attorneys to bear in mind what was said by this Court in Mittleman v. Bartikowsky, 283 Pa. 485: \u201cIt is to be regretted that all members of the Bar do not always keep in mind what was said by this court years ago, that A cause is not well tried unless fairly tried and a verdict obtained by incorrect statements or unfair argument or by an appeal to passion or prejudice stands on but little higher ground than one obtained by false testimony\u2019: Saxton v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., 219 Pa. 492, 495. The winning of a verdict should be a hollow reward to the advocate who has brought it to pass by appeals to a jury\u2019s prejudices and not by the strength of the case presented. Such verdicts are, moreover, worthless, for the courts will not let them stand.\u201d\nThe order of the court is affirmed."}
