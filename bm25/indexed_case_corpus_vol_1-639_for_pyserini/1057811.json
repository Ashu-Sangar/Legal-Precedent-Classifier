{"id": "1057811", "contents": "The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered\nPer Curiam.\nThe negligence of the plaintiff in this case was simply delay, prompted by no notice, or any fact to indicate to him a necessity to sell the collateral, not only for his own benefit but for that of his debtor; and the cause of loss was an accident unforeseen, and not likely to be foreseen. The stock itself was at its par value for the $5000, while its market value was but about $1400. Had the plaintiff sold the stock without notice to or from the defendant, it might have raised a serious question as to the plaintiff\u2019s liability for the sacrifice. It was in the power of the defendant to have caused a sale by the plaintiff at any time, or else to hold the stock at his own risk. Judgment affirmed."}
