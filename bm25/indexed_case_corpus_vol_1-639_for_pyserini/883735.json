{"id": "883735", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe find no error in this record that would justify either a reversal or modification of the decree. The learned judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law are substantially correct, and fully warranted tbe decree dismissing the bill at plaintiff\u2019s costs. There appears to be nothing in either of the specifications of error that requires discussion.\nThe decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellant."}
