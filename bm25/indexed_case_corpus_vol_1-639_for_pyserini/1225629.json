{"id": "1225629", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Horace Stern,\nConvicted some years ago of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment, the relator, Clarence E. Tanner, applied to the court below for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that he had been indicted and tried for the commission of a crime different from that for which he had been held to await the action of the grand jury. The court below refused the writ, from which order the relator now appeals.\nThe homicide arose out of a quarrel between the relator and one Riley during the course of a crap game; following an argument between them the relator shot and killed Riley. A coroner\u2019s inquest held into the death of the deceased \u201crecommended\u201d that Tanner be held for the grand jury upon a charge of manslaughter. The district attorney prepared a bill of indictment charging murder and voluntary manslaughter; a true bill was found by the grand jury and the relator was tried thereon, convicted and sentenced as above stated.\nIn Maginnis\u2019s Case, 269 Pa. 186, 195, 112 A. 555, 558, it was stated that \u201cIt is established law that, when a prosecuting officer is satisfied from his investigations that a higher grade of offense, cognate to the one\u25a0 returned by the committing magistrate, is properly chargeable against a defendant, he may draw the bill accordingly. . . .\u201d In that case the return by a justice of the peace charged the defendant with simple assault and battery; it was held not improper on the part of the district attorney to draw an indictment charging felonious assault and battery, \u2014 a higher degree of the crime. In Commonwealth v. Musto, 348 Pa. 300, 303, 35 A. 2d 307, 309, it was stated that a \u201cdefendant should not be required to answer a charge different from, and unrelated to, the one for which he was arrested and held to bail.\u201d In Nicholson v. Commonwealth, 96 Pa. 503, where an information had been made for seduction under promise of marriage, it was held that an indictment could properly include counts for fornication.and bastardy. In Commonwealth v. Danner, 79 Pa. Superior Ct. 556, 558, it was said that \u201cAny crime arising out of the same transaction can be laid in the indictment\u201d; it was there held that an indictment for receiving stolen goods could be presented by the district attorney upon an information charging larceny. See also Commonwealth v. Ruff, 92 Pa. Superior Ct. 530, 536.\nThe killing of Riley was a single act. The circumstances attending it, its justification, and the grade of the crime thus committed, could properly be determined .only upon the trial of the case even though the coroner\u2019s inquest \u201crecommended\u201d that the relator be held for manslaughter. The finding of a coroner\u2019s jury \u201cis merely advisory to the public authorities charged with the administration of the criminal law. It has been held that a coroner\u2019s verdict ... is merely advisory, . . . notwithstanding the verdict may make it the duty of the coroner to issue a warrant for the arrest of the person suspected . . . .\u201d 13 Am. Jur. 113, \u00a712. Murder and manslaughter are \u201ccognate\u201d to one another and are not \u201cunrelated\u201d, murder being a higher grade of felonious homicide than manslaughter, and both being properly joined as counts in a bill of indictment. If the relator was surprised when he found upon arraignment that he was called upon to answer to the graver charge of murder an application for time to prepare to meet it would undoubtedly have been allowed: Commonwealth v. Carson, 166 Pa. 179, 183, 30 A. 985; Commonwealth v. Gouger, 21 Pa. Superior Ct. 217, 232; Commonwealth v. Danner, 79 Pa. Superior Ct. 556, 558, 559.\nOrder affirmed; costs to be paid by the County of Allegheny.\nFor some unexplained reason, the relator, notwithstanding the return of the grand jury on the murder bill, was admitted to bail a month later to answer a charge of manslaughter."}
