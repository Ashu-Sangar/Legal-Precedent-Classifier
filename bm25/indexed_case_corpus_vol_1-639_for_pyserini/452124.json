{"id": "452124", "contents": "Mr. Justice Clark\ndelivered the opinion of the court, October 1st 1883.\nThis appeal is taken, under the Act of 4th April, 1877, to the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Warren county, refusing to open a.judgment, entered upon a single bill, by' virtue of a warrant of attorney contained therein, in favor of E. II. Day against Frank O. Babcock, for $1,200.\nThe application to open a judgment, whether entered upon a judgment note or otherwise, is an appeal to the discretion of the coart. The only question raised here, in such case, therefore, is whether the court rightly exercised that discretion under the evidence : Earley\u2019s Appeal, 90 Penn. St. 321. This court will not, except for plain error, review the sound discretion of the court below, in weighing the evidence; the same weight will be given to the conclusion of the court upon questions of fact, as is given to the report of an auditor, or the finding of a jury : Bedell\u2019s Appeal, 87 Penn. St. 510; McConnell\u2019s Appeal, 97 Penn. St. 31. When, however, the judgment of the court is based upon a deduction from other facts, the conclusion, being the result of reasoning, is subject to revision and correction if erroneous: Hindman\u2019s Appeal, 85 Penn. St. 466; Milligan\u2019s Appeal, 97 Penn. St. 525.\nWe are weil satisfied, from the testimony, that there was no misrepresentation made by Day to influence Babcock in the purchase; this fact the court distinctly finds, \u2014 and we think the court was certainly right. Babcock\u2019s testimony does not clearly establish the fact that any representations were made by Day, as to the location of the barns; and being a party to the controversy, it is fair to assume that he testified as strongly in his own interest as the truth would allow.\nHe says, \u201c I had no reason to doubt, before I went to Day, that the barns were on the property. I supposed they were on it. He told me the Mark and Priscilla York property was his, barn, houses and all.\u201d\nHe further testifies, in apparent explanation of this : \u2014 \u201c I don\u2019t know as he said there was a house or barn on it.\u201d \u201c I don\u2019t recollect asking Mr. Day whether the barns were on the property.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t recollect any discussion between Mr. Day and myself, about the improvements on the property.\u201d \u201c I don\u2019t know as I had any reason to suppose Mr. Day knew any more about the property than I did.\u201d \u201c I know of no fact that leads me to suppose Mr. Day knew of any claim to them \u201d (the barns).\nIt was certainly the intention of the parties to this transaction, that Day should transfer to Babcock such interest only as he held by the sheriff\u2019s deed; the writings clearly indicated this, the transfer was of \u201cthe within deed and the premises thereby conveyed.\u201d Ho larger bomidary and no greater estate was in contemplation of the parties. The nature of the transaction was unmistakable. There was no reckless assertion\u2014 no warranty \u2014 no concealment \u2014 no deception or fraud ; they were both sincere and honest, both may have been mistaken. Ho hostile claim appeared, no suspicion even attached. Their opportunities for knowing the location of the barns -were at least equal. Babcock lived on an adjoining farm, knew the lines, and directed the subsequent survey. This is not, therefore, the case of a person selling lands which he did not own, and for which he could not make title. The description in the deed was by metes and bounds, and the deed and transfer were effective to vest the title in Babcock. There was no defect in the title to the lands described in the deed, and the truth, as to the actual location of the barns, was as easily ascertainable by one of the parties as the other.\nThe mistake of the parties, however, which resulted from the fault of neither, was so essential, so material and substantial, as that it may reasonably be supposed that, but for the misdescription, they might never have entered into the contract at all. Under the peculiar and special facts of this case, if the injury had been but small, as compared with the consideration, Ave might hold the defendant to be Avithout remedy, but the magnitude of the injury is such, that the defendant should obtain relief in some form. He must not however hold to the profits of his contract, and demand compensation for his loss. He should put the plaintiff in statu quo, tendera reconveyance, demand and sue for a rescission. This is, we think, his proper and indeed his only remedy. \u00a5e cannot mate a contract for the parties which they never made for themselves.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
