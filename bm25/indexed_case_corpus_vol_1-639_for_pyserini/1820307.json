{"id": "1820307", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Chief Justice.\nThe issue to be addressed in this appeal is whether the Board of Claims had exclusive jurisdiction to hear and to determine the underlying claim in this matter. This is a direct appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court, under its original jurisdiction, which transferred to the Board of Claims the action filed by appellant herein, Mark S. Keenheel, whereby he sought to rescind or to nullify an agreement entered into with his former employer, the Pennsylvania Securities Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d). The transfer order issued in response to preliminary objections filed by the Commission challenging the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court. The Honorable Doris A. Smith viewed the matter as based upon a contract executed between appellant and the Commonwealth and concluded that, pursuant to section 4 of the Board of Claims Act, 72 P.S. \u00a7 4651-4 (\u201csection 4\u201d), the appropriate forum to resolve appellant\u2019s complaint in equity was the Board of Claims, hence, the Commonwealth Court lacked jurisdiction. Accordingly, that court transferred the matter pursuant to section 5103 of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5103. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that this action is not one arising from a contract action against the Commonwealth as envisioned in section 4, thus we reverse the decision below and remand the matter to the Commonwealth Court for it to reach the merits of the claim submitted.\nAppellant was employed as an attorney with the Commission, and, in March of 1987, he filed race discrimination charges against the Commission and certain of its officials through the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. On June 17, 1987, the Commission terminated appellant\u2019s employment, effective September 1, 1987. In response, appellant filed a petition in the Commonwealth Court alleging that the termination was in retaliation for filing the charges of race discrimination. Negotiations then commenced between appellant and the Commission. On August 27, 1987, shortly before the termination was to occur, the parties entered into the settlement agreement at issue in this case.\nThe agreement voided the termination of appellant\u2019s employment, and provided that appellant would resign effective September 1, 1987. It also provided that the Commission would pay appellant the sum of six thousand dollars in satisfaction of \u201ccosts and expenses,\u201d and further provided that all personnel records, other than routine data, generated during 1987 pertaining to appellant, would be held by the Commission as non-public records pursuant to the \u201cRight to Know Act,\u201d Act of June 21, 1957, P.L. 390, \u00a7 1 et seq., 65 P.S. \u00a7 66.1 et seq. The agreement further established that information as to these records would not be disclosed publicly, and that, if inquiries were ever made to the Commission regarding the quality of appellant\u2019s job performance, the Commission would state that his performance had been \u201cvery good,\u201d inasmuch as this corresponded to appellant\u2019s performance evaluation of December, 1986. The agreement obliged appellant to withdraw the charges of racial discrimination.\nOn April 25, 1988, appellant, alleging that the Commission had committed a material breach in that the Commission had purportedly disclosed to a member of the general public certain unfavorable allegations regarding appellant\u2019s job performance, commenced this action seeking equitable rescission of the settlement agreement. On June 13, -1988, appellant amended his complaint to include the allegation that the agreement was void under provisions of the \u201cSunshine Act,\u201d Act of July 3, 1986, P.L. 388, No. 84, \u00a7 1 et seq., 65 P.S. \u00a7 271 et seq. He asserted that the agreement had been adopted by the Commission in a private session which, under the Sunshine Act, should have been open to the public, and, further, that information as to the private nature of the session had only recently come to light. In seeking to be released from the agreement, appellant admittedly desires to reinstate his discrimination complaints.\nThe jurisdiction of the Board of Claims is set forth under section 4, which provides in pertinent part:\nThe Board of Claims shall h\u00e1ve exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all claims against the Commonwealth arising from contracts hereafter entered into with the Commonwealth, where the amount in controversy amounts to $300.00 or more.\nIn Shovel Transfer and Storage, Inc. v. Simpson, et at, 523 Pa. 235, 565 A.2d 1153 (1989), this Court recently stated that the determining factor as to whether the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims is invoked depends on whether the claim asserted against the Commonwealth is founded in contract.\nThe mere fact that the validity of a contract may turn upon issues of statutory duty does not create a statutory right of action. Rather, the focus is upon the origin of the rights claimed. In the instant matter, Shovel\u2019s objective is to establish the enforceability of the contract and compel its performance. Shovel\u2019s right to pursue this objective derives necessarily from the rights and obligations created by the contract, not by the alleged violation of a statute by the PLCB or the appellants.\nShovel\u2019s action thus assumes the nature of a breach of contract action in which a traditional remedy for the breach, namely specific performance, is sought. The proper forum for this type of action, therefore, is the Board of Claims.\nSimpson, 523 Pa. at 243, 565 A.2d at 1156.\nIn Simpson it was clear that the dispute centered upon the validity of a contract. The statutory provision was only relevant insofar as it may or may not have impacted upon that question. Thus in Simpson we rejected Shovel\u2019s characterization of its claim as one premised upon a statutory mandate and identified the claim being asserted as one arising from contract. We held that the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims was properly invoked.\nIn ruling that the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board of Claims was invoked in this case, the court below found that the instant action \u201cis based upon a contract.\u201d Keenheel v. Commonwealth, Pennsylvania Securities Exchange Commission, et al., Slip op. at 2, No. 976 (Pa.Commw. July 25, 1988). While it may be true that the contract is the subject of the instant action, it is not the basis for the claim asserted by the appellant against the Commonwealth. Indeed, the instant contract poses an impediment to the claim appellant seeks to assert against an agency of the Commonwealth. This distinction is critical to the instant inquiry. We are not here concerned with a contract claim being asserted against the Commonwealth. To the contrary, appellant has brought the instant action in an effort to avoid any obligation arising from the challenged contract.\nThe jurisdiction of the Board of Claims is not triggered simply because a contract may be involved in an action, rather the jurisdictional predicate is satisfied only when the claimant relies upon the provisions of that contract in asserting the claim against the Commonwealth. The instant case indeed is the converse of Simpson. In Simpson, although a statutory argument was raised, its purpose was to seek the enforcement of the underlying contract and thus rendered the matter one arising from contract. In contrast, in this instance, the appellant is attempting to nullify the contract which serves as an impediment to the statutory claim that he wishes to assert. The instant action is one in equity to declare the contract a nullity so that appellant would then be free to renew his charges of discrimination against the Commonwealth. While the immediate subject of the controversy focuses on an alleged contract, this is not an action in which appellant is asserting a claim against the Commonwealth under the contract at issue.\nThe significance of the Board of Claims is that it provides a forum in which companies which do business with the Commonwealth and its various agencies can present contractual disputes and seek remedies for the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged breaches. Such actions would be impossible were it not for the Board of Claims whose enabling statute expressly abrogates the sovereign immunity that otherwise shields the Commonwealth from suits of such nature. 72 P.S. \u00a7 4651-1. The result, absent this exception to sovereign immunity, would be that parties with contractual complaints against the Commonwealth would be without recourse. Such a circumstance would dissuade others from providing contractual services to the Commonwealth.\nIn order for the objectives of the Board of Claims to be fulfilled, however, a claim must be instituted against the Commonwealth seeking the enforcement of rights that were created by contract. See Simpson, supra. See also, XPress Truck Lines, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, 503 Pa. 399, 469 A.2d 1000 (1983); Ezy Parks v. Larson, 499 Pa. 615, 454 A.2d 928 (1982). The Board of Claims was created to provide a remedy where there would otherwise be none for a party adverse to the Commonwealth. The language of the enabling statute is specific. It vests no reciprocal right in the Commonwealth to avail itself of the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims. Sovereign immunity does not preclude the Commonwealth from pursuing a claim arising from contract in the traditional judicial forum. Thus, where the Commonwealth is seeking to derive the benefits of the contract, the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims is not invoked.\nNotwithstanding, the Commonwealth argues that this matter belongs in the Board of Claims because, if appellant succeeds in rescinding the contract, he will be compelled to return the six. thousand dollars the Commonwealth has paid to him pursuant to the agreement. The Commonwealth insists, therefore, that appellant has lodged \u201c[a claim] against the Commonwealth, arising from [a contract] entered into with the Commonwealth, where the amount in controversy amounts to $300.00 or more.\u201d 72 P.S. \u00a7 4651-4. This is pure sophistry. The argument misconstrues the focus of the statute. According to the Commonwealth\u2019s own contention, any monies paid as a result of appellant\u2019s action will necessarily be paid by appellant and not by the Commonwealth. Thus, any action for reimbursement would be available to the Commonwealth, and not to appellant. Under the clear language of section 4, such an action would not be within the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims.\nThe language of section 4 must be given full effect. Its terms explicitly require that the Board of Claims \u201c... hear and determine all claims against the Commonwealth arising from contracts hereafter entered into with the Commonwealth, where the amount in controversy amounts to $300.00 or more.\u201d Clearly the statute is not applicable to the instant dispute. As stated, appellant is not asserting a contractual claim against the Commonwealth for an amount in excess of $300.00. To the contrary, he is seeking to nullify a contract to relieve himself of any obligations by which he otherwise would be restricted. The rights he asserts do not arise \u201cfrom the contract,\u201d but from a separate claim he wishes to reinstate. Finally, the six thousand dollars is not an \u201camount in controversy.\u201d What is in controversy is the validity of the settlement agreement. It is conceded that, if the agreement is a nullity, the six thousand dollars passed thereunder must be returned; nonetheless its return is not the subject of the instant dispute. Because the requirements of the statute have not been met, the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims has not been invoked.\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the Commonwealth Court is reversed, and the matter is remanded to that court for disposition.\nSTOUT, Former Justice, did not participate in the decision in this case.\nZAPPALA, J., files a concurring opinion.\nFLAHERTY, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nZAPPALA, Justice,\n, Act of 1937, as amended 1978, Oct. 5, P.L. 1104, No. 260, \u00a7 3.\n. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2310 provides that the Commonwealth is immune from suit \"except as the General Assembly shall specifically waive the immunity.\" The statute creating the Board of Claims provides that sovereign immunity is specifically waived in instances where the claim falls within the jurisdiction of the Board of Claims. 72 P.S. \u00a7 4651-4, as amended 1978, Oct. 5, P.L. 1104, No. 260, \u00a7 3.\n. Since we have concluded that this matter is properly a matter for the Commonwealth Court, we need not dwell upon Keenheel\u2019s alternative argument that his claim of violation of the Sunshine Act, Act of July 3, 1986, P.L. 388, No. 84, \u00a7 1 et seq., 65 P.S. \u00a7 271 et seq., would necessarily mandate such a result. We note, however, that if the statutory provision merely relates to the issue of the validity of the underlying contract being asserted against the Commonwealth, this would not deprive the Board of Claims of jurisdiction.
