{"id": "1068422", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nPlaintiff appeals from an order opening a judgment.\nThe summons was issued June 5, 1915, and an appearance was entered for defendant. March 6,1919, statement of claim was filed, and March 20, 1919, defendant put in its affidavit of defense. Counsel for defendant, believing that, \u2014 because suit had been entered before the Practice Act of 1915 went into effect, \u2014 the old practice controlled, and that the next step would be a rule to plead, awaited such action by plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who, however, put the case at issue. Defendant\u2019s attorney had no actual notice the case was on the trial list, and no attempt was made by counsel on the other side to inform him when it was called and a jury selected; hence the trial proceeded ex parte, resulting in a verdict, May 6, 1920, for $87,461.63, in favor of plaintiff. The first notice to defendant of the adverse verdict was on May 17, \u00cd920, and four days later, May 21, 1920, within the term, defendant filed its petition to open the judgment, upon which a rule was granted, and subsequently made absolute, the court below saying it would treat the judgment as though \u201cwon by default.\u201d Under the circumstances, there was n\u00f3 abuse of discretion: Fuel City Manufacturing Co. v. Waynesburg Products Corporation, 268 Pa. 441.\nThe appeal is dismissed."}
