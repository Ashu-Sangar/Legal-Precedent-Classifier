{"id": "937826", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe testatrix divided her estate into two funds, first her personalty, and secondly the proceeds of the sale of her realty. This division was in accordance with the general rule and the general understanding of the distinction made by the law. By the positive direction to sell it is true that the real estate became personalty, and the two funds thus technically merged into one for the purposes of the will if so required. But this technical conversion arises in furtherance of the testator\u2019s intent and not to defeat it. T-he testatrix\u2019s actual intent here is to keep the two funds separate, and such intent being clear it cannot be defeated by any artificial rule of construction.\nThe fact that she failed to dispose of the whole of the second fund cannot be made to defeat the intentional separation.\nDecree affirmed at costs of the appellant."}
