{"id": "4195364", "contents": "ORDER\nNotice of Appeal\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 20th day of May, 2009, it is hereby ordered that this appeal from the Commonwealth Court\u2019s September 9, 2008 Order denying Appellant\u2019s Application for Reargument en banc of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s August 12, 2008 Order dismissing appellant\u2019s petition for review is quashed for lack of jurisdiction. The Commonwealth Court\u2019s September 9, 2008 Order denying reargument is not an appealable order. See, e.g., In re Merrick\u2019s Estate, 432 Pa. 450, 247 A.2d 786, 787 (1968) (quashing appeal from unappealable court order denying reconsideration); Murkey v. Corbin, 115 Pa.Cmwlth. 258, 533 A.2d 1091 (1987), appeal denied, 520 Pa. 621, 554 A.2d 512 (1988) (same); Boden v. Tompkins, 306 Pa.Super. 494, 452 A.2d 833, 834 (1982) (same). Further, the appeal was untimely, as it was not filed within 30 days after the entry of the Commonwealth Courts August 12, 2008 Order dismissing appellants petition for review. See Pa.R.A.P. 903(a); Day v. Civil Service Comm\u2019n of Carlisle, 593 Pa. 448, 931 A.2d 646, 651-52 (2007) (\u201cThe timeliness of an appeal involves jurisdiction.\u201d)."}
