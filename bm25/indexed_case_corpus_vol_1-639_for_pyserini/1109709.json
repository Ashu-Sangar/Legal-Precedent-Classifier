{"id": "1109709", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nA joint judgment was confessed on two 'Separate warrants of attorney, the first of which authorized the entry of judgment against the maker of a certain note and the second a judgment against the payee, who had assigned the note and guaranteed payment to Ms assignee. On application of the executors of the last mentioned defendant, (who died after executing the guaranty and assignment indorsed on the note), the court below struck off the judginent as to him, saying, inter alia, \u201cWe are of the opini\u00f3n that the [holder] of the note cannot enter a joint judgment against the maker and the endorser on the two separate confessions, because the promises of the maker and the guarantor are separate and distinct and do not constitute them jointly liable for the same debt.\u201d\nThe above conclusion is sustained by Union Bank of Nanty-Glo v. Schnabel, 291 Pa. 228; see also Romberger v. Romberger, 290 Pa. 454.\nThe order appealed from is affirmed."}
