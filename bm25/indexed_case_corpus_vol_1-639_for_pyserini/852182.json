{"id": "852182", "contents": "\u25a0Pee Curiam,\nThere was no error in refusing to enter judgment against \u2022the defendant for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.\nIn his statement of claim, plaintiff alleges that the assessments, which he seeks to collect, were levied for the purpose \u25a0of paying the death losses of certain specified horses. In substance, the affidavit of defence denies the existence of any such indebtedness, and avers that at the time said assessments were made there was no such indebtedness by the company, nor is there now, and that the very claims for which said assessments were made have been paid. Assuming, as we must for the purposes of this case, that these averments are true, they con\u25a0stitute a substantial traverse of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as presented \u25a0in his statement.\nJudgment affirmed."}
