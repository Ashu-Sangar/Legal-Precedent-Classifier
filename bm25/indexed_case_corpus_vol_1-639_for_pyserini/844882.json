{"id": "844882", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis case appears to be ruled by Commonwealth v. William Mann Company, 150 Pa. 64, and is affirmed on the opinion of the learned trial judge, sustaining defendant\u2019s sixth exception to his former adjudication.\nThe apparent power \u201c of dealing in books, maps and periodicals, stationery and other like articles,\u201d found in defendant company\u2019s charter, is void, and may therefore be treated as eliminated. That being done the company must be considered as exclusively organized for manufacturing purposes.\nJudgment affirmed."}
