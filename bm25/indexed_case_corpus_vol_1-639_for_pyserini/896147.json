A careful con- , sideration of the questions presented by the record has satisfied us that there is no substantial error in the decree. For reasons given in the opinion of the court, filed March 24, 1897, the decree should not be disturbed.\nDecre\u00e9 affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
