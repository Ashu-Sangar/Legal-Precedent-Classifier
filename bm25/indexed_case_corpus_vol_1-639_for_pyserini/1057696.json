{"id": "1057696", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe answer of the respondents to the petition for the writ of mandamus denied that Harvey D. P. Dietrich, this appellant, was treasurer of the corporation, or that he had any authority to give to the relator access to its boohs. As the demurrer admitted this to be true, judgment should not have been entered against him. His appeal is, therefore, sustained and the judgment as to him is reversed."}
