For the reasons that follow, we affirm the Superior Court because the record shows that trial counsel had a reasonable trial strategy for failing to request that the trial court so charge the jury and thus, he was not ineffective.\nFACTS\nA jury convicted Steven C. Derk (Derk) of, among other charges, first degree murder for the brutal beating death of a two-year-old child, Clair Hoyles, III (\u201clittle Clair\u201d), the son of Derk\u2019s live-in girlfriend, Tamie Gates (Gates). Derk received a life sentence for this murder. Initially, both Derk and Gates were charged with criminal homicide in the death of little Clair. However, Gates entered a negotiated plea agreement, by which she was permitted to plead guilty to the lesser offense of involuntary manslaughter in exchange for her cooperation at Derk\u2019s trial.\nAt the trial of Derk, the Commonwealth\u2019s most incriminating testimony of his guilt came from Gates. Gates testified to a course of violent conduct by Derk toward little Clair, which escalated from July 1992 until little Clair\u2019s death on August 7, 1992. In particular, she related that Derk smashed a roll of tape into the child\u2019s chest, and, on the Monday before his death, smacked her son\u2019s head against the end of a couch. She also testified as to Derk\u2019s abuse of her and her fear of his violent temper, his verbal threats and statements that he was going to kill little Clair and \u201ckick his ass.\u201d\nShe further testified that at about 10:00 or 10:30 a.m. on August 6, 1992, the day before her son\u2019s death, she and Derk fought about a past due light bill During the fighting, little Clair began to cry and Derk swore at the child and sent him to his room. Gates followed little Clair and began to play with him in his room. Derk came to the doorway and continued to argue with Gates. When she refused to take immediate action on the bill, Derk kicked little Clair. He then grabbed the boy by the head and threw the child, stomach down, on the bed and grasped his right ankle, flipped him over and punched him in the stomach with a closed fist. Gates said she heard a cracking sound following the punch, and screamed at Derk not to hit the child in that manner. Derk responded, \u201cI don\u2019t care if I kill him or not, he\u2019s not my son.\u201d\nAccording to Gates, little Clair became ill in the evening of August 6, at about 11:00 p.m. and began vomiting throughout the night, and that both she and Derk were up with the child. She testified that Derk went to bed at 4:30 a.m., while she remained with little Clair on the living room couch. The child finally fell asleep about 8:30 a.m. on Friday, August 7, 1992 and Gates left little Clair on the couch and went to bed. At approximately 10:00 a.m. that same morning, Gates heard a thud and discovered the toddler lying with his head on the top of the stairs in the apartment. Gates, at Derk\u2019s suggestion, took the child to the kitchen and fed him some chicken soup. After feeding him, Gates noticed that little Clair was cold to the touch so she and Derk put him in the tub. When Derk set him down in the water, the child fell, and at that point in time Gates became extremely concerned and insisted on taking little Clair to the hospital.\nDerk called 911 and the emergency dispatch sent an ambulance to the apartment. Gates testified that her concern for little Clair had finally overtaken her fear of Derk so that she demanded medical treatment for the child. Gates told the technician that little Clair had fallen down the steps. Wflien the paramedic arrived at the scene and inquired about how long the child had been unresponsive, Gates replied that little Clair had banged his head against the wall. Little Clair was transported to the Sunbury Hospital where he was pronounced dead.\nAt trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s forensic pathologist testified that little Clair sustained three areas of fatal injury: to his head, neck, and abdomen, which were inflicted at varying times before the child\u2019s death. His head injuries included linear skull fractures, epidural hemorrhaging, and brain herniation. The extent of the damage to the brain was consistent with the child having been dropped from a multistory building. The Commonwealth pathologist testified that brain herniation was probably the cause of death, and that the head injuries were inflicted twenty-four to forty-eight hours before death. He opined that blunt force trauma caused the head injuries.\nThe injury to little Clair\u2019s abdomen included blunt force trauma with damage to an abdominal artery and internal organs so severe that blood was in his abdomen. The pathologist testified that these injuries occurred twenty minutes to three hours before death. The injuries to the boy\u2019s neck area included evidence of manual strangulation, bleeding in the \u201cAdam\u2019s Apple\u201d region and in front of the spinal column, consistent with \u201cshaking\u201d baby syndrome. The child\u2019s neck ligaments were completely torn, presumably from repeated shaking. The injuries to the front of the neck occurred within days before death, and the injuries to the spinal column occurred within minutes to hours of death.\nThe pathologist recounted to the jury the child\u2019s multiple signs of blunt force trauma, manual strangulation and \u201cshaking baby syndrome,\u201d with more than 100 distinct bruises covering his complete body. The child had bruises on his entire face, around both of his eyes and on his forehead. He had bruises around his arms, chest, abdomen, both lower legs, his back, and buttocks. The size and shape of the bruises on his back and buttocks indicated repeated blows with a fist, hand, foot, or toes. There also was a large bruise over the right side of his head covering the ear, forehead, and eye. The right eye was swollen shut. The Commonwealth showed the jury pictures of these injuries.\nIn addition to the testimony of Gates and the pathologist, the Commonwealth presented the testimony of several neighbors and acquaintances, who testified that they overheard Derk verbally abuse the child, threaten to \u201cfucking kill him\u201d and to \u201csmash little Clair against the wall.\u201d One neighbor, Karen Treas, testified that she saw Derk grab little Clair under the arm and back of the head, and while holding him by the hair, forcibly place him on a step in the apartment. Ms. Treas also testified that on the night of the murder, she heard Gates say \u201cknock it off, leave him alone, that\u2019s enough.\u201d N.T. (Vol.I) at 202, 210.\nThe Commonwealth also presented testimony that a number of witnesses, including Tamie Gates\u2019 mother, saw little Clair with bruises that never went away and that Derk would make unbelievable excuses as to the nature of the bruises. Gates\u2019 mother testified that she became so concerned as to the bruises on the child that she had made an appointment to take the boy to the doctor just days before his death. (This appointment never materialized because Gates prevented her mother from seeing the child on the scheduled date.)\nAt trial, defense counsel argued that Gates, and not Derk, had committed the murder, pointing primarily to the time frames that the pathologist attributed to the child\u2019s injuries and the inconsistencies in Gates\u2019 testimony of events. Nonetheless, the jury convicted Derk of the murder. Following his conviction and sentence, Derk appealed to the Superior Court, which affirmed the trial court. We granted review on the sole issue of whether defense counsel was ineffective for failing to request that the court instruct the jury that Ms. Gates was a \u201ccorrupt\u201d source since she was an accomplice to the murder.\nANALYSIS\nTo show that trial counsel was ineffective, appellant must establish that his claim has arguable merit; that trial counsel had no reasonable basis for proceeding as he did; and that the alleged ineffectiveness worked to his prejudice. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 537 Pa. 514, 525, 645 A.2d 189, 194-195 (1994). The burden of estabhshing counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is on the Appellant. Id. Here, Derk has not met this burden.\nOur previous decisions in Commonwealth v. Karabin, 493 Pa. 249, 426 A.2d 91 (1981), and Commonwealth v. Johnson, 496 Pa. 546, 437 A.2d 1175 (1981), control this case. In both Karabin and Johnson, we rejected claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request an \u201caccomplice\u201d instruction as long as some reasonable basis for the attorney\u2019s decision appeared in the record.\nIn Karabin, a jury convicted appellant of murder and reckless endangerment. One of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses was a young woman with whom the appellant had an affair and who was in the car with the appellant when, nearby, he shot one of the victims. The strategy of the defense was to convince the jury that appellant was innocent of the crimes and that this witness was lying because she was jealous of his relationship with another woman. We rejected the appellant\u2019s arguments that trial counsel was ineffective for not requesting an accomplice instruction regarding the witness\u2019 testimony. We concluded, \u201ctrial counsel was not ineffective in failing to request an accomplice instruction. Instead, it was a trial tactic of an obvious sort: Karabin\u2019s defense was that he did not perform the shootings. To request the accomplice instruction could derogate that defense.\u201d Id. at 252-253, 426 A.2d at 92.\nIn Johnson, a jury convicted the appellant of, among other crimes, murder in the first degree. The murder was gang related. One of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses was the leader of a splinter group of the gang, who may have been a conspirator in the murder. The defense strategy was that the witness was framing the appellant for the murder. We held that \u201csince it is clear from the record that failure to request the discretionary accomplice instruction was within the realm of counsel\u2019s trial strategy, it cannot be held to constitute ineffectiveness.\u201d Id. at 550, 437 A.2d at 1177.\nThe Superior Court, following our decisions in Karabin and Johnson, has also stated that trial counsel is not ineffective for failing to request an accomplice jury instruction where the defendant\u2019s defense is that he or she was not involved in the perpetration of the crime. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Quarles, 361 Pa.Super. 272, 522 A.2d 579 (1987), appeal denied, 517 Pa. 592, 535 A.2d 82 (1987); Commonwealth v. Gainer, 397 Pa.Super. 348, 580 A.2d 333 (1990), appeal denied, 529 Pa. 645, 602 A.2d 856 (1992). In Quarles, the jury convicted appellant of, among other crimes, murder. The appellant contended that his trial counsel was ineffective because counsel did not request an \u201caccomplice\u201d jury instruction. The Superior Court held that trial counsel was not ineffective, because the failure to request the instruction was a reasonable trial strategy in the face of appellant\u2019s defense that he was not at the scene of the crime. The Superior Court cogently stated that, \u201cappellant\u2019s trial counsel could not logically argue that appellant had an accomplice to a crime appellant maintains that he did not commit because he has an alibi. Appellant\u2019s counsel consequently reasonably chose to forego requesting an accomplice charge.\u201d Id. at 279, 522 A.2d at 581. Likewise, the Superior Court in Gainer determined that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to request an accomplice instruction. In Gainer, appellant was on trial for arson. An accomplice instruction would \u201chave been inconsistent with appellant\u2019s defense that he did not set the fire but was elsewhere at the time of the conflagration.\u201d Id. at 358, 580 A.2d at 338.\nIt is well settled that whether to request additional points for charge is one of the tactical decisions \u201cwithin the exclusive province of counsel.\u201d Commonwealth v. Sullivan, 450 Pa. 273, 299 A.2d 608, 610 (1973), cert. denied, 412 U.S. 923, 93 S.Ct. 2745, 37 L.Ed.2d 150 (1973). We should not invade that province and declare counsel ineffective if any reasonable basis for counsel\u2019s decision existed at the time of trial. Commonwealth v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A.2d 349 (1967). Rather, we should scrupulously follow the presumption that attorneys act in the interests of their clients, and insist that Appellant meet his burden of proving that his attorneys had no reasonable basis for their action. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Watson, 523 Pa. 51, 65, 565 A.2d 132, 139 (1989).\nHere, a review of the record amply supports a conclusion that trial counsel had some reasonable basis for not requesting the accomplice charge. Counsel argued that Derk was innocent, and the defense strategy was to show that Ms. Gates killed Little Clair. For example, during the closing argument, Derk\u2019s counsel told the jury that, \u201cMr. Derk is innocent of these charges.\u201d N.T. (Vol.4) at 109. He proceeded to pose the question to the jury, \u201cwas it Steven or was it Tamie? Tamie Gates is on trial today as much as Steven Derk is.\u201d N.T. (Vol.4) at 112. Counsel further told the jury that Gates was \u201ccovering up her own story.\u201d N.T. (Vol.4) at 124. He then recounted all of the evidence that pointed to Derk\u2019s innocence and that Gates killed the child, not Derk. N.T. (Vol.4) at 124-152. At one point in his closing, Counsel even explicitly told the jury, \u201cNow what happened? She is writing him [Derk] letters, look how much I love you, because she did it [killed little Clair].\u201d N.T. (Vol.4) at 145 (emphasis added). Thus, an accomplice instruction would have been inconsistent with Derk\u2019s defense that he did not kill the child, and it was a reasonable tactical consideration for trial counsel not to request an accomplice jury instruction. Our inquiry should end there. As we stated in Commonwealth v. Maroney, 427 Pa. at 604, 235 A.2d at 352:\nWe cannot emphasize strongly enough, however, that our inquiry ceases and counsel\u2019s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we can conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests.\nAccord, Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 158-59, 527 A.2d 973, 975 (1987).\nMoreover, simply because Gates was indicted for the same crime does not mean that an accomplice instruction is automatically warranted. Instead, the correct analysis is that an accomplice instruction is appropriate only when the evidence produced at trial permits a reasonable inference that a witness actively participated in, or solicited, the crime charged. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Manchas, 430 Pa.Super. 63, 633 A.2d 618 (1993), appeal denied, 539 Pa. 647, 651 A.2d 535 (1994); Commonwealth v. Phillips, 411 Pa.Super. 329, 601 A.2d 816 (1992), affirmed, 534 Pa. 423, 633 A.2d 604 (1993) (per curiam).\nThe Superior Court in Manchas determined that a corrupt source jury instruction was not required where the Commonwealth witness was present in the home during a murder, although the witness had previously been charged with the crime. The Superior Court held that \u201cthe mere fact that [the witness] had at one time been arrested and charged in connection with the crime did not give rise to an inference that he was an accomplice where there was no evidence presented at trial to indicate that he, in any way, had aided in the murder.\u201d Id. at 82, 633 A.2d at 628.\nIn Phillips, the appellant was on trial for conspiracy, robbery, and aggravated assault. One of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses, Leander Speed (Speed), accompanied the appellant to the scene of the crime, waited in the car for him to return, and then fled the vicinity. Speed was charged as a co-conspirator, but entered a plea bargain in which he pled guilty to receiving stolen property and conspiracy to receive stolen property. After entering the plea, Speed cooperated with the Commonwealth. At trial, Speed testified that he did not know of the criminal actions until after appellant came back to the car, and further testified that he did not share in the stolen property. The Phillips court determined that the trial court did not commit error when it refused to give an accomplice charge to the jury because the testimony at trial did not establish that Speed actively participated in the crime. At most, it showed that Speed was an accessory after the fact and not an accomplice.\nIn this case, like in Manchas and Phillips, the record shows that the Commonwealth did not present evidence at Derk\u2019s trial suggesting that Gates actively participated with Derk in the crimes against little Clair. Nor did the evidence suggest that she solicited Derk to commit the crimes. Therefore, the evidence at trial did not mandate a \u201ccorrupt source\u201d or \u201caccomplice\u201d instruction. For these reasons, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court.\nCASTILLE and NIGRO, JJ., join this opinion.\nOPINION IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL\nCAPPY, Justice.\nThe question presented in this appeal is whether a remand is necessary to decide if trial counsel was ineffective for failing to request a \u201ccorrupt source\u201d jury instruction. For the reasons that follow, I believe a remand is necessary to resolve that issue.\nAppellant was charged with murder in the first degree, murder in the third degree, aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person, and endangering the welfare of children. These charges stemmed from the brutal beating death of a two-year-old child, Clair Hoyles, III.\nClair Hoyles, III, known as little Clair, was the two-year-old son of Tamie Gates and Clair Hoyles, II. Although little Clair\u2019s parents did not marry, they lived together with little Clair until September of 1991, separating shortly after the child\u2019s first birthday. Tamie and little Clair remained in the apartment the family had shared, at N-4, Pine Meadows Apartments in Selinsgrove Borough, Pennsylvania. In the spring of 1992 Tamie began dating appellant. In late May or early June of 1992 appellant moved into apartment N-4 with Tamie and little Clair.\nThe Pine Meadows Apartment complex consists of connected townhouses that share common walls. The neighbors live in close proximity and the construction of the complex is such that neighbors can overhear the activities of each other when the noise level within an adjoining apartment is increased.\nIn July of 1992 Doris Nieves, the resident of apartment N-3, which shares a common wall with Tamie\u2019s apartment, complained to the apartment complex manager, Barbara Dem-shock. Mrs. Nieves complained that she overheard loud arguments between Tamie and appellant which caused her to be concerned for little Clair. Mrs. Nieves specifically overheard appellant threaten to \u201csmash little Clair against the wall.\u201d Mrs. Nieves also overheard Tamie swear at the child referring to him as \u201cyou little f-\u201d and \u201cyou a-.\u201d\nMrs. Demshock spoke to Tamie about Mrs. Nieves complaints. Mrs. Demshock told Tamie that she and Mrs. Nieves were concerned about her welfare and the welfare of her child, and offered assistance. Tamie replied that there was nothing wrong and the neighbors were just being nosy.\nKaren Treas, the resident of apartment N-5, also overheard loud arguments between Tamie and appellant after appellant moved into apartment N-4. Mrs. Treas overheard appellant threaten to kill little Clair. On one occasion when Mrs. Treas was visiting Tamie in apartment N-4, Mrs. Treas observed little Clair immediately begin to cry when appellant entered the apartment. Appellant became angry with little Clair, screaming at the child, and grabbing him under the arm and by the hair. Holding the child by the hair, appellant forcibly placed little Clair on the steps, directing the child to go to his room. When the child continued to cry making no movement towards his room, appellant \u201cpounded little Clair on his butt.\u201d Mrs. Treas stated that Tamie told appellant to stop, but appellant responded \u201che has to learn to stop his balling, he\u2019s such a little pussy ass.\u201d Tamie made no physical move to intervene according to Mrs. Treas testimony.\nDuring the summer of 1992 appellant would attend the car races at the Selinsgrove Speedway, often accompanied by little Clair. Bradley Simcox, a friend of appellant, observed appellant and the child together at the racetrack. Mr. Simcox regularly observed bruises on little Clair. Mr. Simcox questioned appellant about the constant bruising on the child. One explanation offered by appellant was that some older children at a baseball game struck the child. Another time when Mr. Simcox again questioned appellant about the bruises, appellant replied that the child was removed from day-care because other children were picking on him at the day-care center. Mr. Simcox found the explanations unsatisfactory given the child\u2019s condition.\nTina Schlief, Tamie\u2019s mother, testified that during the summer of 1992 she became suspicious about bruises frequently appearing on little Clair. When she would raise the issue to Tamie, she received explanations that failed to satisfy her suspicions. She became so concerned that she made an appointment for 6:30 p.m. on August 6, 1992 to take the child to a doctor to examine the bruises. In arranging to take little Clair, Mrs. Schlief told Tamie that she wanted to take little Clair to a carnival that evening. On Wednesday, August 5, 1992, Tamie called Mrs. Schlief and told her that Tamie and appellant would be taking little Clair out Thursday and Mrs. Schlief could not have him that evening. Mrs. Schlief went to Tamie\u2019s apartment anyway on Thursday evening. Mrs. Schlief observed Tamie\u2019s car in the parking area and knocked on the door. Although Tamie, appellant and little Clair were home, they turned off the lights and did not respond to Mrs. Schlief s knock.\nTamie testified that appellant ordered her not to respond to her mother\u2019s knock. The following morning, August 7, 1992, little Clair was pronounced dead. Tamie testified at appellant\u2019s trial pursuant to a plea bargain agreement with the Commonwealth. Tamie had been jointly charged with appellant for the murder of little Clair. Following the preliminary hearing Tamie agreed to testify against appellant in exchange for a plea to involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit voluntary manslaughter.\nTamie provided background of the events which led to the death of little Clair on the morning of August 7, 1992. Tamie testified that she resided with appellant and little Clair during the spring and summer of 1992 in apartment N-4 of the Pine Meadows complex. According to Tamie\u2019s testimony appellant\u2019s attitude towards little Clair changed after an incident where the child fell while in appellant\u2019s care. On June 16, 1992 Tamie and appellant brought little Clair to the Sunbury Hospital emergency room because the child had fallen down the steps while alone with appellant. Little Clair was treated for facial contusions and bodily injury. Tamie testified that she remained with little Clair in the emergency room while appellant waited in the parking lot. Tamie stated that the emergency room physician made her feel as if she were being accused of child abuse.\nAfter that incident appellant prevented her from seeking medical treatment for little Clair by threatening her that Children and Youth Services would remove the child from her care. Tamie also testified that she was physically afraid of appellant, which prevented her from obtaining treatment for her child. Tamie stated that appellant had thrown her up against the wall and punched her in the stomach. Although her fear of appellant prevented her from interceding when appellant hit little Clair, she would scream at appellant not to strike the child.\nTamie and appellant disagreed over proper measures of discipline for the child. Although Tamie admitted that she often screamed and swore at the child, she stated that only appellant struck the child. According to Tamie the blows to the child were often intended as discipline for behavior exhibited by little Clair. Tamie did state that on one occasion she observed appellant smack little Clair\u2019s head on the wooden arm of the couch for no apparent reason. This incident occurred four days prior to the child\u2019s death. Tamie verbally chastised appellant but took no action to obtain medical help for little Clair.\nThe events immediately preceding the child\u2019s death began with an argument between appellant and Tamie over a past due light bill. When little Clair began to cry appellant swore at the child and sent him to his room. Tamie became frustrated -with appellant and went to little Clair\u2019s room to play with the child. Tamie found the child hiding under the dresser. After coaxing him out she and little Clair went back downstairs. However, appellant began screaming again, the child began crying again, and appellant again, ordered little Clair to his room.\nTamie followed little Clair to his room and once again found him hiding under the dresser. She coaxed the child out and they began to play together in little Clair\u2019s room. Appellant came to the doorway and continued to argue with Tamie. When Tamie refused to take immediate action on the light bill appellant kicked his foot towards Tamie and little Clair. Tamie blocked the kick with her arm, however, appellant\u2019s foot made contact with little Clair\u2019s head. Appellant then grabbed little Clair by the head and threw the child, stomach down, on the bed. Tamie jumped on appellant\u2019s back and tried, unsuccessfully, to hold his arms. Appellant grabbed little Clair\u2019s right ankle flipped him over and punched him in the stomach with a closed fist. Tamie said she heard a cracking sound following the punch, and screamed at appellant not to hit the child in that manner. Appellant responded \u201cI don\u2019t care if I kill him or not, he\u2019s not my son.\u201d Tamie testified that this altercation, which occurred between 10:00 and 10:30 a.m. on August 6, 1992, was the last physical contact between appellant and little Clair before little Clair\u2019s death.\nAppellant then left the apartment for approximately twenty minutes. Tamie did not leave because appellant took her car keys. While appellant was out, Tamie fed little Clair lunch. When appellant returned, he and Tamie took little Clair down to the river for a walk. Tamie testified that the child was fine and was playing and throwing sticks in the water. The rest of the afternoon was uneventful. However, that evening when her mother came by appellant forced her not to respond to her mother\u2019s knock. Tamie went along with appellant because of her fear that appellant would cause physical harm to herself and little Clair.\nLater that evening, about 11:00 p.m., little Clair became ill and began vomiting. Tamie testified that she and appellant both provided care for the child. At 1:00 a.m. appellant drove to a store to get Sprite to settle little Clair\u2019s stomach. Unable to settle the child down to sleep, Tamie sent appellant to bed at 4:30 a.m., while she remained with little Clair on the living room couch. At 8:00 a.m. on the morning of Little Clair\u2019s death Mrs. Nieves, the tenant of apartment N-3, heard Tamie scream at the child \u201cgo to sleep a.\u201d\nThe child finally fell asleep about 8:30 a.m. Tamie left little Clair on the couch and went to bed. About 10:00 a.m. Tamie heard a thud and discovered little Clair lying with his head on the top step. Tamie, at appellant\u2019s suggestion, took the child to the kitchen and fed him some chicken soup. Tamie testified that appellant was- so upset about the child\u2019s condition that appellant punched a hole in the kitchen wall. After feeding the child, Tamie noticed that he was cold to the touch so she and appellant put him in the tub. When appellant set him down in the water the child fell over. At that point Tamie became extremely concerned and insisted on taking little Clair to the hospital.\nAppellant called 911 and the emergency dispatch sent an ambulance to the apartment. Tamie testified that her concern for little Clair had finally overtaken her fear of appellant so that she demanded medical treatment for the child.\nUpon responding to the call the emergency medical technician. observed Clair Hoyles, III, lying on the floor with Tamie attempting mouth to mouth resuscitation. Tamie told the technician that little Clair had fallen down the steps. When the paramedic arrived at the scene and inquired as to how long the child had been unresponsive, Tamie replied \u201che kept banging his head against the wall.\u201d\nLittle Clair was transported to the Sunbury Hospital where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy was performed. The external examination of the body revealed a multitude of bruises indicative of direct blunt trauma. There were bruises over the entire face, around both eyes and on the forehead. There were bruises around the arms, on the chest, the belly and both lower legs. The back showed a multitude of oval shaped bruises. The buttocks showed circular bruises cropped together, indicating repeated blows with either a fist, hand, foot or toes. A particularly large bruise covered the right side of the head encompassing the ear, forehead and eye. The right eye was swollen shut. The jaw revealed four contact points where someone had forcibly grabbed the jaw. The throat revealed scratches consistent with strangulation. The external examination revealed over 100 distinct bruises caused by blunt force trauma.\nThe internal examination revealed severe blunt force trauma to the brain. The extent of the damage to the brain was consistent with the child having been dropped from a multistory building. The neck and spine indicated signs of strangulation and shaken baby syndrome. Blood was found in the belly caused by damage to an abdominal artery. The internal organs showed severe trauma.\nLittle Clair suffered three distinct lethal injuries. Blunt force trauma to the head, occurring within hours to a day before death. Blunt force trauma to the abdomen occurring within hours to a day before death. Strangulation and/or shaken baby syndrome occurring within minutes to two hours before death.\nImmediately after little Clair\u2019s death Chief Hartly of the Borough of Selinsgrove Police Department questioned Tamie Gates. Tamie told the Chief that little Clair repeatedly banged his head on the floor and walls. When asked if she sought medical treatment for the child, Tamie replied in the negative. Tamie explained that she was afraid of accusations of child abuse. When asked on direct examination why she entered a plea of guilty to the charges of involuntary manslaughter and conspiracy to commit voluntary manslaughter, she replied \u201cI\u2019m guilty of not being able to protect my son.\u201d\nFollowing the close of evidence in appellant\u2019s trial the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts, the trial court denied post-trial motions. Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the first-degree murder count; no other sentences were imposed. The Superior Court affirmed the judgment of sentence. This court granted the Petition for Allowance of Appeal, limited to the issue of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to request a \u201ccorrupt source\u201d jury instruction.\nThe burden of establishing counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is on appellant, as counsel is presumed effective. Commonwealth v. McNeil, 506 Pa. 607, 487 A.2d 802 (1985). To satisfy the burden appellant must first prove that the tactic, argument, or issue, which counsel has forgone, and which forms the basis of the claim of ineffectiveness, is of arguable merit. Commonwealth v. Durst, 522 Pa. 2, 559 A.2d 504 (1989). Once this threshold has been met, the reviewing court must ascertain whether counsel had a reasonable basis for his action or inaction. Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A.2d 349 (1967). If the reviewing court determines that there was no reasonable basis for counsel\u2019s chosen course, then appellant must demonstrate that counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness so prejudiced appellant that it had an adverse effect on the outcome of the case. Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987).\nWe turn first to the question of prejudice. If appellant has not been prejudiced by the ineffectiveness of counsel then our inquiry would end. Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 661 A.2d 352 (Pa.1994). Thus, we must consider whether counsel\u2019s failure to request a corrupt source charge so prejudiced appellant that it had an adverse effect on the outcome of the case.\nThe testimony of Tamie Gates was the crucial piece of evidence against appellant. Without Tamie\u2019s testimony the case against appellant was circumstantial. Both Tamie and appellant were alone with little Clair during the relevant time period as the medical examiner testified that the lethal injuries suffered by the child occurred within minutes to a day preceding death. Although the neighbors overheard threats appellant made towards the child, those same neighbors overheard Tamie screaming and swearing at little Clair. When Tamie\u2019s mother made arrangements to take little Clair to the doctor because she was suspicious about the constant bruises on the child, she did not tell Tamie her intent. Instead Mrs. Schlief told Tamie that she wanted to take little Clair to a carnival. The medical examiner found scratches on little Clair\u2019s throat consistent with strangulation. Chief Hartley testified that appellant\u2019s fingernails were so short that it was impossible to take scrapings. No attempt was made to take scrapings from the fingernails of Tamie Gates. Tamie Gates was alone with little Clair from 4:30 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. the morning he died. At 8:00 a.m. Mrs. Nieves, the neighbor in apartment N-3, overheard Tamie scream at little Clair \u201cgo to sleep you a-.\u201d\nThe \u201ccorrupt source\u201d charge is designed specifically to address situations where one accomplice testifies against the other to obtain favorable treatment. The words of the suggested charge itself are the strongest presented to a jury for consideration of a witness\u2019 testimony.\nExperience shows that an accomplice, when caught, will often try to place the blame falsely on someone else. He may testify falsely in the hope of obtaining favorable treatment, or for some corrupt or wicked motive. ... First, you should view the testimony of an accomplice with disfavor because it comes from a corrupt and polluted source. Second, you should examine the testimony of an accomplice closely and accept it only with care and caution.\nPennsylvania Standard Jury Instruction (Criminal) (revised October 1981) Section 4.01.\nHowever, instead of this strong admonition to carefully scrutinize the testimony of Tamie Gates, a named co-defendant, the jury was instructed as follows:\nMs. Derk (sic), a co-defendant in this case, has also testified. You have received testimony regarding a plea agreement which she has entered, and part of the plea agreement was that she would testify in this case. You should subject her testimony to the same scrutiny that you would any other witness. You should not necessarily believe or disbelieve her testimony simply because she is testifying by virtue of her entering into a plea agreement in this matter. Simply because she has chosen to testify again does not mean that you are permitted to draw any adverse inference against the defendant as a result of him exercising his right not to testify in this matter.\nIf the jury had been instructed to consider the testimony of Tamie Gates as coming from a corrupt and polluted source, that she had a strong motive for her testimony as it deflected guilt from herself, and that they should consider her words with caution; there is a reasonable probability that the verdict against appellant would have been different. Thus, we must turn to a consideration of the arguable merit of appellant\u2019s claim.\nA \u201ccorrupt source\u201d instruction is warranted in any case where an accomplice offers testimony implicating the defendant. Commonwealth v. Chmiel, 536 Pa. 244, 639 A.2d 9 (1994). To be an accomplice one must have knowledge of and participate in the specific crime charged. Commonwealth v. Bricker, 525 Pa. 362, 581 A.2d 147, 151 (1990); Commonwealth v. Thomas, 479 Pa. 34, 387 A.2d 820, 822 (1978). \u201cThe general rule for determining whether a witness is an accomplice is \u2018whether or not he could be indicted for the crime for which the accused is charged.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Sisak, 436 Pa. 262, 259 A.2d 428, 431 (1969), quoting, Commonwealth v. Hopkins, 165 Pa.Super. 561, 69 A.2d 428 (1949).\nIn the instant case we need not examine the evidence to determine if it permits an inference that Tamie Gates was an accomplice. In this case Tamie Gates was in fact indicted for the same crimes as appellant. Therefore Tamie Gates was an accomplice and appellant was entitled to the \u201ccorrupt source\u201d instruction. Commonwealth v. Coades, 454 Pa. 448, 311 A.2d 896, 898 (1973).\nAs we find appellant has raised a claim of arguable merit which projects potential prejudice we must reach the question of whether counsel had a reasonable trial strategy for failing to request a \u201ccorrupt source\u201d instruction regarding the testimony of Tamie Gates. The Commonwealth argues that to request the corrupt source charge would derogate counsel\u2019s chosen strategy. The defense strategy was to focus on Tamie Gates as the sole murderer.\nAppellant presented witnesses who testified that appellant enjoyed a close relationship with little Clair, and in fact, Tamie was jealous of that relationship. Other defense witnesses testified that Tamie had a temper and would physically attack appellant.\nDuring cross-examination Tamie admitted that in her statement to the Commonwealth pursuant to the plea agreement, she had lied. Cross-examination raised serious questions as to the credibility of Tamie\u2019s testimony that she failed to intercede in appellant\u2019s abuse of her son because of her fear of appellant. This portion of Tamie\u2019s testimony was undercut by evidence of her continuing assertions of her love for appellant after the death of little Clair. Tamie wrote to appellant\u2019s family stressing her love for appellant while she was in prison. Cross-examination also revealed the fact that Tamie gave birth to appellant\u2019s son while she and appellant were in jail awaiting trial on charges of murdering little Clair. Tamie\u2019s sudden change in her attitude towards appellant coincided with her acceptance of the plea bargain agreement.\nClearly counsel\u2019s trial strategy was to assert appellant\u2019s innocence by focusing on Tamie Gates as the sole guilty party. The Commonwealth asserts that requesting the \u201ccorrupt source\u201d charge would derogate the defense strategy by placing before the jury the concept that appellant and Tamie were accomplices. To argue that it would derogate counsel\u2019s chosen strategy to tell the jury that Tamie was an \u201caccomplice\u201d is questionable when the jury was in fact told that Tamie was a co-defendant. The Commonwealth would have this court believe that a jury would be more likely to look with disfavor on appellant if Tamie were his \u201caccomplice\u201d rather than his \u201cco-defendant.\u201d Without more than this bare bones assertion, we find such reasoning disingenuous.\nHowever, without a full record the question of whether trial counsel possessed a reasonable trial strategy, designed to effectuate appellant\u2019s interest, that was served by the omission of the \u201ccorrupt source\u201d charge, cannot be answered. In the instant case the question of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness was raised for the first time before the Superior Court. Thus, the trial court was without the opportunity to assess the merits of counsel\u2019s chosen strategy. Given the fact that the testimony of Tamie Gates was so crucial to the resolution of this case, and that trial counsel vigorously attacked her credibility on cross-examination, the answer to our query as to a reasonable trial strategy is not apparent from a cold reading of the record before this court.\nWhere the reviewing court can ascertain from the record that counsel lacked a reasonable trial strategy for failing to pursue a particular course of conduct, a remand to address the issue is unnecessary. See, Commonwealth v. McBee, 513 Pa. 255, 520 A.2d 10 (1995); Commonwealth v. Brinkley, 505 Pa. 442, 480 A.2d 980 (1984); Commonwealth v. Morin, 477 Pa. 80, 383 A.2d 832 (1978). However, where the record in a case is incomplete, or there are factual questions, which cannot be resolved without further proceedings, then a remand is necessary to fully evaluate an ineffectiveness claim. See, Commonwealth v. DeGeorge, 506 Pa. 445, 485 A.2d 1089 (1984); Commonwealth v. Byrd, 493 Pa. 178, 425 A.2d 722 (1981); Commonwealth v. Musi, 486 Pa. 102, 404 A.2d 378 (1979); and Commonwealth v. Connolly, 478 Pa. 117, 385 A.2d 1342 (1978).\nThus, although I find that counsel\u2019s failure to request a \u201ccorrupt source\u201d instruction regarding the testimony of Tamie Gates raises a claim of arguable merit, I am unable to ascertain from the record whether or not counsel possessed a reasonable trial strategy for failing to request the \u201ccorrupt source\u201d instruction. Because the failure of counsel to request the \u201ccorrupt source\u201d charge, absent a reasonable trial strategy designed to effectuate appellant\u2019s interests, would prejudice appellant, a remand of this matter to the trial court for a hearing on the ineffectiveness issue is necessary.\nAccordingly, I believe the decision of the Superior Court should be reversed and the case remanded to the trial court for a hearing consistent with this opinion.\nFLAHERTY, C.J., and ZAPPALA, J., join this Opinion in Support of Reversal.\n. The jury also convicted Derk of third degree murder, aggravated assault, recklessly endangering another person and endangering the welfare of children.\n. Following Derk's trial, the trial judge rejected Gates\u2019s plea agreement, presided over a separate trial of Gates and the jury convicted her of third degree murder, aggravated assault and endangering the welfare of children.\n. The \"corrupt source\u201d jury instruction as found in the Pennsylvania Standard Jury Instructions (Criminal) (revised October 1981) at Section 4.01, provides as follows:\n(1) When a Commonwealth witness was so involved in the crime charged that he was an accomplice his testimony has to be judged by special precautionary rules. Experience shows that an accomplice, when caught, will often try to place the blame falsely on someone else. (He may testify falsely in the hope of obtaining favorable treatment, or for some corrupt or wicked motive.) On the other hand, an accomplice may be a perfectly truthful witness. The special rules that I shall give you are meant to help you distinguish between truthful and false accomplice testimony.\n(2) [In view of the evidence of_'s criminal involvement you must regard him as an accomplice in the crime charged and apply the special rules to his testimony.] You must decide whether_ was an accomplice in the crime charged. If after considering all the evidence you find that he was an accomplice then you must apply the special rules to his testimony, otherwise ignore those rules. Use this test to determine whether_was an accomplice: (An accomplice may be defined as a person who knowingly and voluntarily cooperates with or aids another in the commission of a crime.)\n(3) These are special rules that apply to accomplice testimony:\nFirst, you should view the testimony of an accomplice with disfavor because it comes from a corrupt and polluted source.\nSecond, you should examine the testimony of an accomplice closely and accept it only with care and caution.\nThird, you should consider whether the testimony of an accomplice is supported, in whole or in part, by other evidence. Accomplice testimony is more dependable if supported by independent evidence. [However, even if there is no independent supporting evidence you may still find the defendant guilty solely on the basis of an accomplice\u2019s testimony if, after using the special rules I just told you about, you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accomplice testified truthfully and the defendant is guilty.]\n. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a) and (c); 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702; 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2705; and 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4304.\n. The trial court rejected the plea. Subsequently Tamie Gates was convicted, by a jury, of third degree murder.\n. The dispatch operator testified that the name given by the caller was Peter Derr, not Steven Derk.\n. In fact the prosecutor acknowledged that there were serious inconsistencies between Tamie Gates pretrial statements and her trial testimony. The prosecuting attorney advised the jury in his closing argument not to believe everything that Tamie Gates, his star witness, said.\n. The appeal to the superior court was the first opportunity appellant had to raise this issue as it was the first time he was represented by counsel other than trial counsel. Commonwealth v. Pizzo, 529 Pa. 155, 602 A.2d 823 (1992)."}
