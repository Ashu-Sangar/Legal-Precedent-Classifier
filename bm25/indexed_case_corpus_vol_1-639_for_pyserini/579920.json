{"id": "579920", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eoberts,\nOn the afternoon of January 31, 1967, appellant, a 19 year old youth, after having learned from friends that he was wanted by the police, voluntarily surrendered to the Scranton Police Department. Appellant\u2019s action was motivated by the fact that he had been earlier advised that one Frank Smith, Jr., had been arrested for a series of burglaries, and had, shortly after being taken into custody, implicated appellant in the commission of these crimes. The following day (February 1, 1967) after having been detained and interrogated for over 21 hours, appellant signed a statement admitting his complicity in seven burglaries. Immediately thereafter, appellant was preliminarily arraigned.\nOn August 11, 1967, appellant pleaded guilty to one count of burglary (No. 20B), and was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. On October 2, 1967, appellant proceeded to trial, before a jury, on the second burglary count (No. 7e), and was adjudged guilty. Prior to this trial, a timely filed motion to suppress the confession was denied. (At trial, this challenged confession was, over objection, introduced against appellant). Post-trial motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to serve a term of 23 months imprisonment. On November 1, 1968, appellant pleaded guilty to the five remaining burglary charges then outstanding against bim (Nos. 7a, b, c, d, and 10). Appellant was sentenced on each of these offenses to serve a term of imprisonment of one and one-half to four years, each sentence to run concurrently with those already being served.\nAn appeal, allowed as if timely filed, was taken to the Superior Court, which affirmed in an opinionless per curiam order, with two judges dissenting. (Hoffman, J., filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Spaulding, J.). This Court granted allocatur, and we now reverse the conviction in No. 7e, and remand for an evidentiaryhearing in Nos. 7a, b, c, d, 10, and 20B.\nAppellant here argues, as he did in the Superior Court, that the 24 hour \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d between his arrest and arraignment renders his confession, given only at the end of this period, inadmissible. Pa. R. Crim. P. 116(a) (effective January 1, 1965, replaced by Pa. R. Crim. P. 118 (effective May 1, 1970)); Commonwealth v. Dutton, 453 Pa. 547, 307 A.2d 238 (1973); Commonwealth v. Tingle, 451 Pa. 241, 301 A.2d 701 (1973); Commonwealth v. Futch, 447 Pa. 389, 290 A.2d 417 (1972). Appellant also contends that the hearing court\u2019s erroneous refusal to suppress the confession was the primary motivation for appellant\u2019s subsequent pleas of guilty to the remaining charges. Accordingly, appellant challenges the validity of these pleas. Cf. Commonwealth v. Walters, 431 Pa. 74, 244 A.2d 757 (1968); Commonwealth v. Stokes, 426 Pa. 265, 232 A.2d 193 (1967).\nIt is now well settled that at the time of appellant\u2019s arrest (1967), all persons \u201carrested with or without a warrant\u201d were required to \u201cbe taken without unnecessary delay before the proper issuing authority for a preliminary arraignment.\u201d Pa. R. Crim. P. 116(a) (effective January 1, 1965) ; Dutton, supra. Where this mandate has gone unfulfilled by the Commonwealth, \u201call evidence obtained during \u2018unnecessary delay\u2019 except that which . . . has no reasonable relationship to the delay whatsoever\u201d must be excluded. Futch, supra at 394, 290 A.2d at 419 (emphasis added). See Dutton, supra; Tingle, supra. Our task on appeal, therefore, is to determine whether there was an \u201cunnecessary delay,\u201d and if so, whether the evidence obtained is causally related to the delay. Our review of the instant record convinces us that both questions must be answered in the affirmative.\nHere, the Commonwealth\u2019s own evidence, as well as the opinion of the trial court, indicates that appellant voluntarily surrendered himself to the Scranton police on the afternoon (approximately 3:00 P.M.) of January 31, 1967. Appellant was thereafter detained and interrogated for 24 hours, and at 3:00 P.M. on February 1, 1967, finally signed a statement admitting his complicity in seven separate burglaries. During this 24 hour period, appellant was returned to his home, in the custody of the police, where evidence (cash receipts) of one crime was obtained by the authorities.\nThe Commonwealth does not in any way seek to justify this delay, but rather asserts that as appellant was not \u201cthreatened\u201d or \u201cabused,\u201d his confession represents a knowing and voluntary, and therefore valid, act. However, this argument misses the point\u2014Pa. R. Crim. P. 116(a) (as well as its progeny Pa. R. Crim. P. 118 and 116) requires that all arrestees be preliminarly arraigned \u201cwithout unnecessary delay.\u201d The Commonwealth has made no suggestion whatsoever that the instant delay was necessary. Accordingly, we must conclude that the 24 hour delay between appellant\u2019s arrest and arraignment was \u201cunnecessary,\u201d and hence violative of Rule 116(a). Dutton, supra; Tingle, supra; Futch, supra.\nNor can it be seriously suggested that the challenged confession was not \u201creasonably related\u201d to this \u201cunnecessary delay.\u201d Futch, supra at 394-96, 290 A.2d at 419. By the Commonwealth\u2019s own concession, appellant, a 19 year-old youth with no prior police contact, did not \u201cconfess\u201d until 24 hours after arrest and repeated interrogation. It was only then, after giving a written statement, that appellant was preliminarily arraigned. On these facts, \u201c[w]e must conclude that the challenged statement here, as the evidence in Futch, supra, was \u2018reasonably related\u2019 to the \u2018unnecessary delay\u2019 and thus inadmissible.\u201d Tingle, supra at 247, 301 A.2d at 704.\nHaving determined appellant\u2019s confession to be invalid, and erroneously admitted at his trial, we are now called upon to pass on appellant\u2019s contention that his guilty pleas to the six remaining burglary charges were primarily motivated by the illegally obtained confession. However, the record before us is insufficient to make such a determination. Accordingly, as no post-trial motions were filed by appellant prior to this appeal allowed as if timely filed, the record is remanded to the trial court for the filing of post-trial motions, with instructions, to the trial court, to conduct an evidentiary hearing. Cf. Commonwealth v. Starr, 450 Pa. 485, 301 A.2d 592 (1973); Commonwealth v. Kelly, 436 Pa. 21, 258 A.2d 325 (1969).\nThe judgment of sentence in No. 7e is reversed and a new trial granted. The records in Nos. 7a, 7b, 7c, 7d, 10, and 20B are remanded to the trial court for the filing of post-trial motions, with instructions to hold an appropriate evidentiary hearing.\nMr. Justice Eagen dissents.\nAlthough appellant did not raise this specific argument in his pretrial (1967) motion to suppress (which was based on purported violations of the standards set forth in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966) and Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S. Ct. 1758 (1964)), the Commonwealth has not objected to it being raised here, and we should not raise an objection sua sponte. Commonwealth v. Page & King, 451 Pa. 331, 334 n.3, 303 A.2d 215, 216 n.2a (1973). Indeed, had such an objection been voiced by the Commonwealth, it would have been without merit.\nAs Commonwealth v. Futch, 447 Pa. 389, 290 A.2d 417 (1972) (deciding for the first time in this Commonwealth 'that all evidence obtained during an \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d between arrest and arraignment, except that evidence unrelated to the delay, is inadmissible), was not decided until five years after appellant\u2019s trial, appellant cannot be held to have waived the right to litigate that claim. As this Court made dear in Commonwealth v. Simon, 446 Pa. 215, 218, 285 A.2d 861, 862 (1971) (quoting from Commonwealth v. Cheeks, 429 Pa. 89, 239 A.2d 793 (1968) : \u201c \u2018[I]t would be manifestly unfair to hold appeUant to a waiver when this waiver is alleged to have occurred at a time when neither the defendant nor his attorney had any way of knowing that there existed a right to be waived.\u2019 Id. at 95, 239 A.2d at 796. Cheeks and its progeny . . . established the rule that failure to raise an issue in a prior proceeding is not a waiver when the legal principles upon which the issue is premised are newly announced in an appellate decision rendered subsequent to the date of the prior proceeding.\u201d (footnote omitted). See also Commonwealth v. Jefferson, 423 Pa. 541, 546, 226 A.2d 765, 768 (1967).\nMoreover, appellant\u2019s present contention is properly before this Court for the additional reason that the \u201cground\u201d for relief presented here is the identical one presented to the hearing court in appellant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress\u2014the invalidity of the confession. Merely because appellant \u201cadvances a new or different theory as a basis for\u201d relief, the ground or issue remains precisely the same. Commonwealth v. Slavik, 449 Pa. 424, 430, 297 A.2d 920, 923 (1972). Appellant here does not advance a new \u201cground,\u201d he merely raises an argument legally different from that raised below. As this Court held in Slavik, supra (quoting from Sanders v. United States, 373 U.S. 1, 16, 83 S. Ct. 1068, 1077 (1963)), \u2018\u201cidentical grounds may often he supported hy different legal arguments, . . .\u2019 \u201d the \u201cground\u201d appellant advances here, the invalidity of the confession, having been preserved below, is accordingly properly before this Court.\nAppellant also challenges the plea entered in No. 20B, prior to the suppression hearing court\u2019s refusal to suppress the challenged confession. Appellant alleges that this plea was also motivated primarily by the illegally obtained confession.\n\u201cThis Court in Futch [447 Pa. 389, 393, 290 A.2d 417, 419 (1972) (citations omitted) (emphasis added)] made it clear \u2018. . . that failure to comply with Rule 118 [and prior to 1970, Rule 116(a)] does not ipso facto render inadmissible evidence obtained by the police during the \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d and that it is incumbent upon defendant to show some prejudice from the delay.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Tingle, 451 Pa. 241, 244-45, 301 A.2d 701, 702-03 (1973).\nChief Justice, then Judge Buboes, provided the following guidelines for determining \u201cnecessary delay\u201d between arrest and arraignment: \u201cNecessary delay can reasonably relate to time to administratively process an accused with booking, fingerprinting and other steps. . . .\u201d Adams v. United States, 399 F.2d 574, 579 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (concurring opinion). See Commonwealth v. Tingle, 451 Pa. 241, 245, 301 A.2d 701, 703 (1973); Commonwealth v. Futch, 447 Pa. 389, 392, 290 A.2d 417, 418 (1972).\nAlthough obviously disbelieved by the suppression court, appellant testified that: \u201cAfter they had locked me up they came back and took me out again and kept asking me questions, and kept telling me that Frank had already confessed to certain crimes, and they named crimes that I never heard of, and then they took me back to the cell again and brought me back when I wouldn\u2019t tell them nothing, and they said, \u2018We are gomg to make it hard on you\u2019, and things like that, \u2018We are going easy on Smith\u2019. Then they locked me up and after they had taken me out of my cell and took me back. As they would be locked me up they would be bringing Smith back in again and bringing him out and later on coming and get me. The next day in the morning they came and got me and took me back again, and they told me they had Smith upstairs and he had signed a statement. \u2018So you might as well do it too, we ioill go easy on you, and it won\u2019t he so hard\u2019, and things like that And when I told them I wasn\u2019t going to they took me back and locked me up again.\u201d"}
