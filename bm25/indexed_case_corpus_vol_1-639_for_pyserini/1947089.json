{"id": "1947089", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Jones,\nBy his \u201cLast Will and Testament\u201d, dated June 22, 1967, Richard A. Glenn bequeathed his personal estate to his adopted son, Richard B. Glenn. Testator also devised real estate to the appellant son. The residue is devised and bequeathed to Robert Lee Glenn, the decedent\u2019s brother, and the Mercantile Bant of Dallas, Texas, in trust. The trustees are directed to distribute the income to Richard B. Glenn, \u201cfor his benefit or that of his family\u201d, with discretion to invade the principal to benefit the appellant and his family. Distribution of shares of the principal is scheduled to be made to appellant, Richard B. Glenn, at ages thirty-five, forty and forty-five.\nThe body of Richard A. Glenn was discovered on February 1, 1972. On February 2, 1972, appellant Richard B. Glenn was arrested and charged with his father\u2019s murder.\nAppellant has admitted to committing the acts resulting in his father\u2019s death, but he has interposed the defense of insanity. His criminal trial was scheduled for July 5, 1972, but was postponed, upon appellant\u2019s motion, pending the disposition of this appeal of the lower court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s Petition for an Advancement of funds from the decedent\u2019s estate. Appellant seeks an advancement purportedly necessary to defend the criminal indictment against him. The executor has questioned, successfully in the court below, whether the Slayer\u2019s Act, Act of August 5, 1941, P. L. 816, \u00a7\u00a71-16, 20 P.S. \u00a7\u00a73441-3456, should bar appellant\u2019s advancement.\nThe Slayer\u2019s Act provides that \u201c[n]o slayer shall in any way acquire any property or receive any benefit as the result of the death of the decedent. . . .\u201d Act of August 5, 1941, P. L. 816, \u00a72, 20 P.S. \u00a73442. The term \u201cslayer\u201d is defined in the Act as \u201cany person who participates, either as a principal or as an accessory before the fact, in the wilful and unlawful killing of any other person.\u201d Id. \u00a71, 20 P.S. \u00a73441.\nAppellant urges that the order of the lower court denying appellant\u2019s advancement abridges the presumption of innocence in his forthcoming criminal proceeding, thereby denying him due process and equal protection of the law.\nAppellant cites In re Tarlo\u2019s Estate, 315 Pa. 321, 172 Atl. 139 (1934), for the proposition that an adjudication of guilt in a prior criminal proceeding is necessary before the alleged \u201cslayer\u201d can be barred from inheritance. Tarlo\u2019s Estate, decided on the basis of the precursor of the present Slayer\u2019s Act, held that the estate of a father who fatally shot his daughter, and then committed suicide, was not precluded from taking the daughter\u2019s estate by inheritance, since the father had not been \u201cadjudged\u201d guilty of murder. The prior Act contained the provision that \u201c[n]o person who shall be finally adjudged guilty ... of murder\". . . shall be entitled to inherit. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Since the prior Act is repealed, and the Slayer\u2019s Act contains no such similar language, the holding in Tarlo\u2019s Estate is a relic without moment in this matter.\nAppellant has taken the position that no disinheritance is possible without prior conviction and that no conviction can constitutionally follow without permitting him the advancement of an amount sufficient to construct the defense of insanity to the criminal charges against him. It is clear that a conviction of murder proved by evidence beyond reasonable doubt is a bar to the Orphans\u2019 Court relitigating the issue of guilt or innocence of the convicted \u201cslayer\u201d. In re Kravitz Estate, 418 Pa. 319, 211 A. 2d 443 (1965). But, the appellant\u2019s argument that he has been denied due process and equal protection of the law, by reason of the fact that the presumption of innocence is curtailed when an advancement from decedent\u2019s estate is denied, presupposes that a criminal conviction is a necessary prerequisite to his disinheritance under the Slayer\u2019s Act. There is no hint in the Act that a prior criminal conviction of murder is the necessary antecedent of disinheritance.\nAppellant also urges that the denial of an advancement from the estate will effect a denial of his right to the effective assistance of the counsel of his own choice where a private fund, i.e., the estate, is available to permit the exercise of that right. As a corollary, he urges that the denial of an advancement from the estate will prevent him from obtaining the psychiatric evaluation necessary to establish the defense of insanity.\nThe right of an indigent defendant in a criminal trial to the assistance of counsel is a fundamental right essential to a fair trial. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963). Eule 318 of the Eules of Criminal Procedure comports with the mandate of Gideon. The indigent\u2019s right to counsel in this Commonwealth is codified in the Public Defender Act, Act of December 2, 1968, P. L. 1144, \u00a76, as amended, 16 P.S. \u00a79960.6, which furnishes, inter alia, legal counsel to any person charged with an indictable offense who is unable to obtain counsel for lack of sufficient funds. Furthermore, while generally the appellant is not entitled as a matter of right to state-appointed psychiatric expert testimony respecting his sanity, the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act, Act of October 20, 1966, P. L. 96, art. IY, \u00a7408, 50 P.S. \u00a74408, does establish a procedure for the appointment of physicians to determine the competence of criminal defendants. Appellant, if indigent, is thus provided both appointed counsel and the machinery for psychiatric evaluation.\nAssuming there is support for the untenable position that the indigent accused has the right to the private counsel of his choice, and not merely appointed counsel, we still could not permit an accused \u201cslayer\u201d to inherit from his alleged victim, to the extent necessary to defray the cost of his defense. The express language of the Act prohibits the \u201cslayer\u201d from benefiting \u201cin any way\u201d from the decedent\u2019s estate. Any advancement of funds before adjudicating the appellant\u2019s culpability would obviate the legislative policy underpinning the Act.\nAppellant contends alternatively that, irrespective of whether the advancement of funds is statutorily or constitutionally compelled, the expenditure of estate funds for the counsel of appellant\u2019s choice and for psychiatric evaluation is within the administrative ambit of the executor. It is argued that these expenditures would effectuate the testator\u2019s intent, and thus could properly be made. We find no indication on the record, nor does reason dictate, that decedent\u2019s testamentary intent would be promoted by the grant of appellant\u2019s Petition for Advancement. We therefore hold that the executor\u2019s refusal to grant the Petition for Advancement was not an abuse of discretion.\nOrder affirmed. Appellant to pay costs.\nThe testator provided that if Richard B. Glenn pre-deceased him, the personalty would be distributed to Robert Lee Glenn, his brother, and Vivian Phillips, his deceased wife\u2019s sister; the realty would pass to the residuary estate and the principal of the trust would inure to the benefit of Robert Lee Glenn, or his issue, and the Mt. Lebanon United Presbyterian Church.\nAt the Coroner\u2019s Inquest, the Commonwealth proffered the testimony of a female companion of Richard B. Glenn, who had spent the night of the murder at the decedent\u2019s home. She testified that she heard a struggle in the basement and that, upon entering the basement, she saw the appellant standing over decedent\u2019s battered body. The witness also testified to assisting appellant in the removal of decedent\u2019s body from his home. The corpse was removed to West Virginia, where it was later discovered.\nRobert Lee Glenn, the decedent\u2019s brother, was named executor. The will provided that in the event of his unwillingness or inability, Mellon National Bank and Trust Company should serve as executor. Robert Lee Glenn renounced his right to serve and letters testamentary were thus issued to Mellon National Bank and Trust Company.\nSection 23 of the Intestate Act, Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 429, \u00a723, 20 P.S. \u00a7136, repealed, Act of August 5, 1941, P. L. 816, \u00a716, 20 P.S. \u00a73456.\nCommonwealth ex rel. Smith v. Ashe, 364 Pa. 93, 71 A. 2d 107, cert. denied, 340 U.S. 812 (1950) ; Commonwealth v. Green, 346 Pa. 172, 29 A. 2d 491 (1943)."}
