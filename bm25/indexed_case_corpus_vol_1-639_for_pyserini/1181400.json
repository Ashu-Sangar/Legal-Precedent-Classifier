{"id": "1181400", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nThis is a petition by the District Attorney of Allegheny County for a writ of prohibition directed to the president judge of the Court of Common Pleas of that county and to the president judge of the County Court, to prevent the assignment of a County Court judge to hold the court of Oyer and Terminer in that county, pursuant to the Act of May 21, 1937, P. L. 791.\nThe question is whether the Act is constitutional. Section 1 provides: \u201cThat, in addition to the powers now possessed and exercised by the judges of the county court in and for the county of Allegheny, said judges shall, when called upon by the president judge of the court of common pleas of the same judicial district as hereinafter provided, have power to hear and determine, when certified according to the provisions of clause (b) of this section, all pleas or criminal issues, and all issues and other matters in the court of oyer and terminer and general jail delivery and the court of quarter sessions of the peace for said judicial district, so fully and effectually and to dispose thereof in the same manner as may be done by the judges of the court of common pleas sitting in said courts.\u201d Other provisions need not be recited.\nA majority of the judges of the common pleas agreed, as the order quoted in the record states, that the Act \u201cis clearly in violation of Article Y, section 8, of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, but deeming it to be in the public interest that the constitutionality of the aforesaid act be tested,\u201d they proceeded to give effect to its provisions. McKim, P. J., of the County Court, \u201cwas detailed and certified to preside specially as called upon [in the trial of] the case of Commonwealth v. Frank Scarpino, No. 16 April Sessions, 1937, O. & T.\u201d in which Scarpino is indicted on the charge of robbery.\nThe County Court is not one of the courts established by the constitution; it was created pursuant to the Act of May 5, 1911, P. L. 198, 17 PS section 621, et seq.: Gottschall v. Campbell, 234 Pa. 347, 83 A. 286. It was given jurisdiction in civil actions for money judgments not exceeding $600; in replevin, subject to the same maximum; exclusive jurisdiction in so-called desertion cases (Com. v. Hopkins, 241 Pa. 213, 88 A. 442) and of appeals from summary convictions and from judgments on suits for penalties in courts not of record: section 6 (b), (c) and (d). It is a court of limited jurisdiction and inferior to the court of common plgas.\nAllegheny County has one court of common pleas with 14 judges. Article V, section 4, of the constitution, provides that \u201cUntil otherwise directed by law, the courts of common pleas shall continue as at present established, except as herein changed. ...\u201d Section 8 requires the court of common pleas \u201cin turn to detail one or more of their judges to hold the courts of oyer and terminer ... in such manner as may be directed by law.\u201d Section 9 provides that \u201cJudges of the courts of common pleas learned in the law shall be judges of the courts of oyer and terminer. ...\u201d\nAs the constitution, then, directs that common pleas law judges \u201cshall be judges of the courts of oyer and terminer,\u201d and that the common pleas judges of Allegheny County must detail \u201cone or more of their judges to hold the courts of oyer and terminer\u201d we examine the Act to see whether the legislature, ostensibly acting pursuant to the words of section 8 \u201cin such manner as may be directed by law,\u201d has changed the manner in which the common pleas judges shall detail \u201cone . . . of their judges\u201d to hold the oyer and terminer. We see at once that if the Act is relied on as authority to call in a county court judge, the common pleas judges are relieved from the constitutionally imposed duty of detailing one of their number and, instead, are permitted to detail one who is not a judge of the common pleas. The Act would not produce a mere change in the manner of detailing a common pleas judge nor would it be making a change in the common pleas within the authority of section 4, but it would result in a choice from a class of judges whose members are not authorized by the constitution to hold the court. The Act is in plain conflict with Article Y, section 8, \u201cThe said courts [of common pleas] in the counties of Philadelphia and Allegheny, respectively, shall, from time to time, in turn detail one or more of their judges to hold the courts of oyer and terminer and the courts of quarter sessions of the peace of said counties, in such manner as may be directed by law.\u201d\nThe Act of May 21,1937, P. L. 791, is, as was thought by a majority of the learned judges of the court of common pleas, in conflict with the constitution and void; petitioner is entitled to the writ, but we shall assume, until further advised, that it will be unnecessary formally to cause the writ to be issued; respondents shall pay the record costs.\nOn jurisdiction, see McNair\u2019s Petition, 324 Pa. 48, 187 A. 498; First Congressional District Flection, 295 Pa. 1, 144 A. 735.\nSubsequent amendments have increased this amount."}
