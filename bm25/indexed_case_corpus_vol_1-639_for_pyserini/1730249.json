{"id": "1730249", "contents": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM:\nIn this appeal from the judgment of sentence imposed following appellant\u2019s conviction of murder in the third degree, it is maintained appellant\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective and he was thus denied a fair trial.\nSince we are unable to ascertain from the trial record the accuracy of the factual allegations upon which the ineffective counsel complaint is based, we will remand the record to the trial court with directions to conduct an evidentiary hearing and to determine the merit of this assignment of error. Cf. Commonwealth v. Dancer, 460 Pa. 95, 331 A.2d 435 (1975).\nAfter the foregoing determination is made, the trial court is directed to file a written report with this Court.\nIt is so ordered."}
