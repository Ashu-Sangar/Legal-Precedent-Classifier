{"id": "1787723", "contents": "Opinion of the Court\nPER CURIAM.\nAppellant, Joseph D. McMahon, filed a writ of mandamus in the Commonwealth Court asserting that the Pennsylvania Probation and Parole Board had erred in computing his term of imprisonment upon his recommitment for a parole violation based upon subsequent criminal convictions. By memorandum opinion and order dated November 3, 1982, the Commonwealth Court dismissed the writ of mandamus and appellant filed a notice of direct appeal to this Court.\nAs explained in Pennsylvania Department of Aging v. Lindberg, 503 Pa. 423, 469 A.2d 1012 (1983) and its companion cases, the writ of mandamus in the instant case was not properly a matter addressed to the Commonwealth Court\u2019s original jurisdiction, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 761, but was, rather, a matter properly addressed to that court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 763.\nAccordingly, appeal to this Court is at our discretion, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 724, not by right of appeal, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 723(a). Pennsylvania Department of Aging v. Lind- berg, supra. We therefore deem the instant \u201cdirect appeal\u201d as a petition for allowance of appeal, Pa.R.A.P. 1102, and deny the petition.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which McDERMOTT, J., joined.\n.
