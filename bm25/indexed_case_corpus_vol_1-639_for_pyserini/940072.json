{"id": "940072", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nNo question is raised by this appeal as to the guilt of the prisoner, or the justice and propriety of his conviction; The single assignment of error is to the admission as a witness of a boy of eight years whose testimony was not material to the establishment of the prisoner\u2019s guilt and had no practical bearing on it. The objection raises no more than a question of technical error in theoretical law.\nThe substantial test of the competency of an infant witness is his intelligence, and his comprehension of an obligation to tell the truth. The truth is what the law, under the rules of evidence is seeking, and if a full and present understanding of the obligation to tell it, is shown by the witness, the nature of his conception of the obligation is of secondary importance. Each witness must be qualified by an obligation that has a solemn sanction to him, though like the breaking of a plate or beheading a chicken as in case of some nationalities it appears frivolous or offensive to others. In the present case the witness clearly comprehended the difference between truth and falsehood, and his duty to tell the truth. That was the substance of qualification as a witness. The trial judge in whose discretion the matter very largely rested was satisfied of the competency of the boy, and we are of opinion that his discretion was well exercised. After quoting from 8 Wigmore on Evidence, sec. 1821, he added: \u201c It seems to us that the crude and shadowy beliefs of small children concerning God and the hereafter, are so uncertain, that the tests, based upon religious instruction, even though given by the trial judge himself, are of little or no moment, and should rather be discarded than followed in this enlightened age. The whole purpose of the trial is to ascertain the truth, and the oath is in pursuance of that object. If the witness understands that this is demanded and that punishment will follow its violation, it is sufficient. It is the substance, instead of the form, that is required, and if we secure this, there would seem to be little benefit in pursuing the shadow. A witness may easily show intelligence and understanding, without being asked each perfunctory question. In this case, it appeared to us that the boy understood perfectly the position in which he was placed, and that the truth was what was demanded of him. There was no reason why he, nor anyone connected with him should testify except from their actual knowledge, and the testimony itself shows the care with which the respective stories were told.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed and record remitted for purpose of execution according to law."}
