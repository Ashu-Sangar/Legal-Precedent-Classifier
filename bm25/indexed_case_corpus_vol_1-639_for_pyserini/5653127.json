{"id": "5653127", "contents": "OPINION\nChief Justice CAPPY.\nAppellant filed his second petition pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (\u201cPCRA\u201d), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-46, in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, Criminal Division (\u201cPCRA court\u201d). The PCRA court dismissed the petition as untimely, and this direct appeal followed. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\nAppellant and his co-defendant, Richard Laird, were tried together and convicted of, inter alia, first-degree murder and were sentenced to death. On direct appeal, this Court affirmed the convictions and sentences. Commonwealth v. Chester, 526 Pa. 578, 587 A.2d 1367 (1991). On November 12, 1991, the Supreme Court of the United States denied Appellant\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. Chester v. Pennsylvania, 502 U.S. 959, 112 S.Ct. 422, 116 L.Ed.2d 442 (1991). Appellant subsequently filed his first PCRA petition, and the PCRA court denied that petition. On appeal, this Court affirmed. Commonwealth v. Chester, 557 Pa. 358, 733 A.2d 1242 (1999). Appellant then filed a pro se petition for writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts, and current counsel was appointed. While preparing to represent Appellant, current counsel discovered that Appellant\u2019s trial counsel was arrested for driving under the influence (\u201cDUI\u201d) only days after entering his appearance on behalf of Appellant. Shortly after making this discovery, Appellant filed his second PCRA petition, claiming, inter alia, that trial counsel\u2019s arrest created a conflict of interest and that by failing to inform him of trial counsel\u2019s arrest and conflict of interest, the prosecution violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\nAfter a hearing, the PCRA court dismissed the petition, holding that, because Appellant\u2019s petition was untimely, it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the mei'its of Appellant\u2019s substantive claims. The PCRA court specifically concluded that the petition did not meet any of the statutory exceptions to the PCRA\u2019s one year jurisdictional time-bar for filing a PCRA petition. In the alternative, the PCRA court reasoned that Appellant either previously litigated or waived all of his claims under his conflict of interest theory. Appellant then appealed to this Court.\nAppellant filed the instant PCRA petition on February 2, 2001, well after the effective date of the 1995 amendments to the PCRA. The petition, therefore, is governed by the PCRA as amended. Commonwealth v. Yarris, 557 Pa. 12, 731 A.2d 581, 586 (1999). Under the amended PCRA, all petitions, including a second or subsequent petition, must be filed within one year of the date that the petitioner\u2019s judgment became final, unless one of the three statutory exceptions applies. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1); Yarris, 731 A.2d at 586. The PCRA\u2019s time restrictions are jurisdictional in nature. Id. (citing Commonwealth v. Peterkin, 554 Pa. 547, 722 A.2d 638, 641 (1998)). Thus, \u201c[i]f a PCRA petition is untimely, neither this Court nor the trial court has jurisdiction over the petition. Without jurisdiction, we simply do not have the legal authority to address the substantive claims.\u201d Commonwealth v. Lambert, 884 A.2d 848, 851 (Pa.2005) (citations omitted).\nHere, Appellant\u2019s judgment became final on November 12, 1991, when the Supreme Court of the United States denied Appellant\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. 42 Pa.C.S \u00a7 9545(b)(3). Appellant filed the instant PCRA petition more than eight years later. Accordingly, the petition is untimely, unless Appellant pled and proved one of the following three statutory exceptions:\n(i) the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States;\n(ii) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence; or\n(iii) the right asserted is a constitutional right that was recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States or the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania after the time period provided in this section and has been held by that court to apply retroactively.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(i)-(iii). Additionally, any petition invoking an exception provided in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1) must be filed within sixty days of the date that the claim could have been presented. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2).\nAppellant first avers that his petition meets the requirements of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(ii) since his discovery of trial counsel\u2019s DUI arrest amounts to \u201cnewly discovered evidence.\u201d According to Appellant, the Commonwealth stipulated below that he filed the instant PCRA petition within sixty days of discovering this evidence, and therefore, the only question relevant to determining whether he has proven that this evidence qualifies as \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d is whether the evidence \u201ccould not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h). In this regard, Appellant argues that due diligence should not include placing a burden on a criminal defendant to investigate the criminal record of his or her trial counsel for possible conflicts of interest, particularly when the trial court and the prosecution allegedly had this information in their possession.\nThe Commonwealth takes the position, as did the PCRA court, that the exercise of due diligence would have resulted in Appellant discovering trial counsel\u2019s arrest. In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, the simple act of checking the clerk of courts\u2019 file would have revealed to Appellant that trial counsel had been arrested and prosecuted for DUI.\nIn order for Appellant\u2019s argument to succeed, he was required to plead and prove that \u201cthe facts upon which [his] claim is predicated were unknown to [him] and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(ii) (emphasis added). The fact that the Commonwealth does not dispute Appellant\u2019s assertion that he did not \u201cdiscover\u201d trial counsel\u2019s arrest for DUI until January 29, 2001 does not equate to the Commonwealth stipulating that, for purposes of the 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(ii), trial counsel\u2019s arrest was \u201cunknown\u201d to Appellant. This Court has held that, for purposes of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h), information is not \u201cunknown\u201d to a PCRA petitioner when the information was a matter of public record. See Commonwealth v. Lark, 560 Pa. 487, 746 A.2d 585, 588 n. 4 (2000) (holding that the Baldus-Woodworth study is not \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d for purposes of the 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h) because \u201cthe statistics which comprise the study were of public record and cannot be said to have been \u2018unknown\u2019 to Appellant\u201d); Commonwealth v. Whitney, 572 Pa. 468, 817 A.2d 473, 476 (2003) (same). Here, the fact that trial counsel was arrested for DUI was a matter of public record and, therefore, cannot be said to have been \u201cunknown\u201d to Appellant for purposes of the PCRA\u2019s \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d exception to the PCRA\u2019s one year jurisdictional time-bar. Accordingly, the PCRA court properly determined that Appellant\u2019s argument under the \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d exception fails.\nNext, Appellant argues that the \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d exception applies to his petition. In order to meet the statutory requirements of the \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d exception to the PCRA\u2019s one year jurisdictional time-bar, Appellant was required to plead and prove that his \u201cfailure to raise the claim [or claims] previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim [or claims] in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States....\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(i) (emphasis added).\nAppellant\u2019s argument under this exception is not entirely clear. In his brief to this Court, Appellant avers that both the District Attorney\u2019s Office and the trial court judge were, aware of trial counsel\u2019s arrest and conflict of interest; that both of these government officials had \u201cconstitutionally-based\u201d obligations to make Appellant aware of this information; and that these officials failed to fulfill their constitutional obligations to inform Appellant of this information. Appellant reasons that \u201cthese particular government officials interfered with [Appellant\u2019s] ability to raise this claim any sooner than he did.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 31. Furthermore, Appellant challenges the PCRA court\u2019s determination that, because the evidence at issue is not exculpatory, the Commonwealth was not required by Brady to disclose the evidence to him. Appellant characterizes this determination as a non-sequitur. In his view, the issue under this exception is merely whether, \u201cunder the PCRA, [Appellant] was prevented from discovery by the acts or omissions of government officials.\u201d Appellant\u2019s brief at 32. In closing, Appellant submits that this Court should rule that a prosecutor must disclose to a defendant evidence within his or her possession which creates a conflict of interest on the part of the defendant\u2019s attorney and that when a prosecutor (or a trial court) fails to disclose such information, that withholding of information constitutes governmental interference. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument in response to this claim essentially mirrors the rationale employed by the PCRA court in rejecting Appellant\u2019s \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d claim.\nWe cannot perceive how Appellant\u2019s failure to raise his claims previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claims. Appellant does not contend, for instance, that the Commonwealth had exclusive control over information regarding trial counsel\u2019s arrest and that the Commonwealth denied him access to this information until recently. As stated above, trial counsel\u2019s arrest was a matter of public record and was just as available to Appellant and his previous counsel as it was to Appellant and his current counsel. It, therefore, cannot be said that Appellant could not have brought his claims previously as the result of any alleged interference by governmental officials. For these reasons, we hold that the PCRA court properly determined that Appellant\u2019s argument under the \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d exception fails.\nAppellant\u2019s PCRA petition is untimely on its face, and Appellant has failed to plead and prove that his petition meets the requirements of the statutory exceptions to the PCRA\u2019s jurisdictional time-bar. This Court and the PCRA court, therefore, lack jurisdiction to consider Appellant\u2019s substantive claims. Accordingly, this Court affirms the order of the PCRA court dismissing Appellant\u2019s second PCRA petition.\nJustice CASTILLE, SAYLOR and EAKIN join the opinion.\nJustice BAER files a concurring opinion in which Justice NEWMAN and BALDWIN join.\n. We directly review the denial of post-conviction relief in death penalty cases under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9546(d). Questions regarding the scope of the statutory exceptions to the PCRA\u2019s jurisdictional time-bar raise questions of law; accordingly, our standard of review is de novo. See Commonwealth v. Cruz, 578 Pa. 325, 852 A.2d 287, 292 (2004).\n. With all due respect to Mr. Justice Baer, we do not hold that \"criminal defendants are generally responsible for the arduous task of uncovering the criminal record of their attorney, where no basis for such discovery exists.\u201d Concurring Opinion 586 Pa. at 476, 895 A.2d at 525. Simply, we hold that as a PCRA petitioner pleading the \"newly discovered evidence\" exception to the PCRA's one year jurisdictional time-bar, Appellant failed to meet his burden of proving that the facts upon which his claim is predicated were \"unknown\u201d to him. Our holding, therefore, only applies to Appellant, a PCRA petitioner, and his burdens regarding 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(ii).\n. We note that there is a significant measure of bootstrapping in Appellant's arguments regarding the PCRA\u2019s exceptions to the one year jurisdictional time-bar. In order to conclude that the Commonwealth interfered with Appellant\u2019s ability to bring his conflict of interest claim by failing to inform him of the alleged conflict of interest, this Court first would have to determine that a conflict of interest indeed existed. To determine as much would require the Court to reach the merits of Appellant's underlying substantive claims before resolving whether the Court has jurisdiction to entertain those very claims."}
