{"id": "1759133", "contents": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM:\nIn this contested adoption proceeding, the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, entered a final decree involuntarily terminating the parental rights of D.L.O.H. and R.F.H. in respect to their son, Baby Boy O. This appeal challenges that decree.\nThe trial court found that D.L.O.H. had freely and knowingly executed a written consent to the adoption of her son, and also concluded that both D.L.O.H. and R.F.H. had failed to perform their parental duties in respect to their son continuously for a period in excess of six months without reasonable excuse. Cf. Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, 1 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq. (Supp.1978), \u00a7\u00a7 311 and 411. Our study of the record is persuasive that the court\u2019s findings and conclusions are warranted by the testimony and that the appeal is without merit.\nDecree affirmed. Each side to pay own costs.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case."}
