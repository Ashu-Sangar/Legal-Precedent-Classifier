{"id": "875789", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe act complained of in this case was done in the exercise of an unquestionable equity power of the court below.\nIn November, 1894, judgment in default of sufficient affidavit of defense was entered against the defendant. On his application, a week thereafter, a rule to amend the assessment of damages was granted. By agreement of counsel for both parties that rule was \u201c treated as a rule to open the judgment \u201d theretofore entered; and on December 22, 1894, the same was made absolute. The action of the court in thus opening the judgment and letting the defendant into a defense is assigned as error.\nThe proceeding under the rule, as modified by agreement,, was virtually an appeal to the equity power of the court which, in all judgments by default, may be invoked by the defendant. In such applications, \u201c it is proper for the court to weigh the evidence and decide according to the preponderance thereof, and this court will not reverse for the exercise of a sound discretion:\u201d Wernet\u2019s Appeal, 91 Pa. 319. That appears to have-been done in this case. The record fails to show that the discretion, with which the court is invested in all such cases, was not properly exercised. There is nothing in either of the assignments of error that requires further notice. They are both dismissed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by plaintiff."}
