{"id": "1470740", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, May 13th 1867, by\nThompson, J.\n\u2014 It does not admit of a doubt that a common barrier may by a special contract, and perhaps by notice, limit his /liability for loss or injury to goods carried by him, as to every cause of injury, excepting that arising from his own or the negligence of his servants. A great variety of cases cited in the very able argument of the learned counsel for the defendants, establish this as the rule in England, from Southcote\u2019s Case, 4 Coke\u2019s Rep. 84, A. D. 1601, down to The Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co. v. The Hon. Farquhar Shand, 11 Jurist 771, in 1865. The same rule generally holds in the several states in this country, as will appear in Story on Bailments, \u00a7 549 notes a and b; Dow v. New Jersey Steam Navigation Co., 1 Kern. 484; and in the Supreme Court of the United States, York Co. v. The Central Railroad Co., 3 Wall. 107. This has long been the rule in this state, as is shown by Bingham v. Rogers, 6 W. & S. 495; Lang v. Calder, 8 Barr 479 ; The Camden and Amboy Railroad Co. v. Baldauf, 4 Harris 67; Chouteaux v. Leech, 6 Id. 224; Goldey v. The Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 6 Casey 242; and Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Henderson, 1 P. F. Smith 315.\nThat there was a special acceptance limiting the defendants\u2019 liability to one dollar a pound in case of loss or destruction, in this case, is among the facts found in the case stated. The hills of lading, duly executed and signed by the agents of the defend; ants, containing the limitation, it is agreed were delivered to the plaintiffs, accepted by them and remitted to their agent at New York as his authority to receive the goods. These, therefore, were the terms on which the transporters shipped their goods and on which they were received to he transported. As this was a limitation of the common-law liability, we are to presume, of course, that the charge for transportation was in proportion to the risk, an element of charge in all such cases. The conditions of shipment on the bill of lading show this, by expressing the limitation to he. because of the \u201cshipper declining to pay for any higher risk.\u201d We have, therefore, a contract to transfer goods under a special agreement as to liability, and a consideration based, we must presume, on the undertaking in its limited form.\nThis limitation, we are warranted in saying, took the case out of the law of common carriers and carried it into one of the numerous classes of bailments, and it henceforth became liable to be governed by the law of the class.\nThe reason will be apparent on a moment\u2019s reflection. The common law defines the duty and the liability in the one case\u2014 in the other the law is set aside by agreement of the parties, and they make a law for themselves, and thus they stand on the_ relation they create, and not on the law of common carriers.\nBy the common law the carrier is an insurer of the goods intrusted to him, excepting so far as they are damaged by the act of God or public enemies.\nBy a contract limiting liability he is an insurer by agreement, and according to its terms. If there be a loss, the agreement fur-. nishes the extent of liability and is confined to that, unless he can | show that the loss occurred from the wilfulness or negligence of \\ the carrier. Plis liability is as a private carrier or bailee, a consequence of the limitation. This is settled in various forms of expression in numerous books and cases of authority. In Angel\u00ed on the Law of Carriers, \u00a7 268; it is said: \u201c Therefore, as I there has been occasion before to show that in cases of contract I \\and by means of notices, common carriers descend only to the (situation of private carriers for hire.\u201d\nIn York Co. v. The Central Railroad Co., supra, this language is found: \u201c By the special agreement the carrier becomes, with reference to the particular transaction, an ordinary bailee ; a private carrier for hire.\u201d\nIn Goldey v. The Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 6 Casey 242, supra, we said the same thing in these words: \u201c The most it can do (the limitation), is to relieve them from these conclusive presumptions of negligence which arise when an accident happens that is not inevitable even by the highest care, and to require that (negligence be actually proved against them.\u201d In the N. J. Steam Navigation Co. v. The Merchants\u2019 Bank, 6 Howard 384, the principle is thus stated: \u201c The respondents having succeeded in restricting their liability as carriers by the special agreement, the burden of proving that the loss was occasioned by the want of due care or by gross negligence, lies on the libellants, which would be otherwise in the absence of any such instruction.\u201d The same principle appears in Marsh v. Horne, 5 B. & C. 322, where the limitation as to the extent in value of the liability was held to vary the relation and requires proof of negligence against the carriers. So in Harris v. Packwood, 3 Taunt. 264, this rule was applied. So also to this effect are Angel\u00ed on Carriers, \u00a7 276 ; Story on Bailments, \u00a7 573; 2 Greenleaf on Evidence, \u00a7 218; and Sager v. The B. R. Co., 31 Maine Rep. 228. Without pursuing further this line of thought we now proceed to determine how the case stands affected by these principles.\nThe plaintiffs shipped goods on the 8th of July 1864, by the defendants\u2019 line to New York, under an acceptance of limited liability as well as notice. The goods were safely carried by the defendants to their wharf at New York, and placed under a shed on the wharf ready for delivery; but-before the plaintiffs had notice of their arrival or opportunity to remove them, a fire broke out on board a steamer of the defendant\u2019s lying at the wharf, which entirely consumed the boat with her cargo, and also the wharf and shed and the goods therein, including the goods of the plaintiffs. The origin of the fire remains unknown. Watchmen employed by the defendants were on duty at the time, and the crew of the steamer were on board. These facts all appear in the case stated. It also appears that the defendants have paid to the plaintiffs the full amount of liability stipulated for, and assumed in case of loss in the bill of lading. Are they bound to the extent of the entire loss ? If so the exception or limitation would amount to nothing, not, it is true, because the limitation is void, but on a question regarding the burthen of proof.\nAssuming the contract or special acceptance of the goods, to be carried by the defendants to bring them within the doctrine applicable to bailments for compensation, the rule seems clearly to be: \u201c That where a demand of the thing loaned is made, the party must return it, or give some account how it was lost.\n\u201cIf he shows a loss, the circumstances of which do not lead to any presumption of negligence on his part, then the burden of proof might, perhaps, belong to the plaintiff to establish it:\u201d Story on Bailments, \u00a7 278. \u201c But if a suit should be brought\nagainst the pawnees for a negligent loss of the pawn, then it would be incumbent on the plaintiff to support the allegations of his declaration by proper proofs, and the onus probandi in respect to negligence would be thrown on him:\u201d Id., \u00a7 839, and note 4. \u201c With certain exceptions which will hereafter be taken notice of (as to innkeepers and common carriers), it would seem that the burden of proof of negligence is on the bailor; and proof merely of the loss is not sufficient to put the bailee on his defence:\u201d Id., \u00a7 410. The text is supported by many authorities. The common law, consistent with itself in this, as in all other cases, lays the basis of this rule in the presumption that every person is presumed to do his duty until the contrary is proved. This is a great modification of the Roman law, which held the acts of faithlessness in a bailee as infamous and compelled him to acquit himself thereof by proof. The French rule as to proof is the same. The rule in England and in many of the states, if not all, is what Story states it to be ; supra. See Marsh v. Horne, 5 B. & C.; and Harris v. Packwood, 3 Taunt., supra; and Wyld v. Pickford, 8 M. & W. 460.\nIn Buckham v. Showers, 6 Rawle 179, speaking of a case of special acceptance to carry, and of suit against the bailee, Rogers, J., says: \u201c Less than positive proof\u201d (of why the goods never reached their destination) \u201c would suffice; but some account should be given from which the jury would be warranted to infer that the goods had either been discharged, or had been lost by accident, or had gone into other hands than the defendants or his agents.\u201d\nThis case shows that where a bailee accounts for a loss in a way not to implicate himself in a charge of negligence, this is a sufficient defence, unless the plaintiff proves negligence. This is the plaintiffs\u2019 reply to the plea in excuse of performance. It is an affirmative position and must be proved by the party alleging it. It is true the plaintiff in the first instance, taking the present case as illustration, must have shown if it had been tried in the ordinary way, that he delivered the goods to'the defendants to be carried to New York, that their agent called for them and could not get them. There he might have rested to hear the reply, and that would be, proof that the goods were accidentally consumed by a fire breaking out on the steamboat at the wharf which consumed the boat, the wharf and buildings of the defendants and the goo.ds in them, including the plaintiffs\u2019; that the boat had its complement of men on board and the defendants four watchmen on the wharf. Out of these facts negligence could not be inferred. The plaintiffs\u2019 reply would be, therefore, \u201c All that may be true ; but the fire originated in your negligence.\u201d Is it not perfectly clear that as that was not inferable from the defendants\u2019 case that the plaintiffs must prove it ? This is not to be doubted. The same doctrine with that above cited, is also to be found.in Clark v. Spence, 10 Watts 335; in Goldey v. Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 6 Casey, supra; and the N. J. Steam Nav. Co., 6 Howard 384.\nWe think, therefore, that as the contract to carry these goods was as bailees for hire, and not as common carriers, and as they did carry them according to their agreement to the terminus of their line, and they were- there destroyed by fire, the defendants are not liable in the absence of proof of negligence, to respond to the plaintiffs\u2019 claim. The doctrine is firmly settled that a common carrier cannot limit his liability so as to cover his own, or his servants\u2019 negligence. Nor do I suppose this possible of any bailee. But it is clear that by contract, he may be placed in the position of a limited insurer, excepting negligence, instead of an insurer against everything but the act of God and public enemies. If he be compensated only for the former risk instead of the latter, at the choice of the consignor, it would be -contrary to common honesty to compel him to make good a risk he was not paid for assuming. We think the case was well decided at Nisi Prius, and the\nJudgment is affirmed.\nWoodward, C. J. \u2014 I dissent as to the onus prolandi."}
