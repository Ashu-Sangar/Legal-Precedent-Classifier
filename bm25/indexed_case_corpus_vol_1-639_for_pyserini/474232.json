{"id": "474232", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Chief Justice.\nThis is an appeal from the Order of the Commonwealth Court which reversed the Order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board and reinstated the referee\u2019s grant of benefits pursuant to a fatal claim petition filed by Appellee, Anna Biddle, the widow of the decedent. We granted allocatur limited to the issue of whether the circumstances of the decedent\u2019s employment support a conclusion that the decedent had \u201cno fixed place of work,\u201d such that Appellee would be eligible to receive benefits pursuant to her fatal claim petition.\nAppellant, Thomas Mekis & Sons, Inc., builds and repairs bridges. The decedent was employed by Thomas Mekis & Sons, Inc., as a project manager at the time of the accident that resulted in his death. The accident occurred on the evening of December 17, 1985. After work, the decedent, the project superintendent, and a project carpenter went to dinner at a restaurant near the project site. The three men finished their dinner sometime between 7:30 p.m. and 7:45 p.m. at which time the decedent drove his employer\u2019s pickup truck from the restaurant to his home. The decedent\u2019s fatal accident occurred at approximately 9:50 p.m. when the pickup truck collided with another truck. A witness testified that at the time of the accident the weather was cold, windy and snowy.\nAppellee filed for compensation, and the referee awarded benefits based upon the conclusion that the decedent was acting within the course of his employment at the time of the accident. The referee\u2019s relevant conclusions of law were as follows:\n1. The deceased was in the course of his employment by [Appellant] at the time of his fatal motor vehicle accident.\n2. The deceased was unfit to drive a motor vehicle at the time of his fatal accident because of the .12 alcohol concentration in his blood. It was in violation of Pennsylvania law by driving with this blood alcohol concentration.\n3. [Appellant] did not meet its burden of showing that the deceased\u2019s violation of law caused his fatal motor vehicle accident.\n4. The claimant\u2019s petition should be granted.\n(Reproduced Record at 10a).\nAppellant appealed to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) which concluded that the decedent was not furthering the business of his employer. (Reproduced Record at 136a). The Board found that, based on the evidence, the \u25a0 decedent was going home from work when he was killed. Id. The Board stated that the burden of proof was on Appellee to establish that the decedent was furthering the employer\u2019s business when the decedent was fatally injured off the employer\u2019s premises. Id. It concluded that Appellee failed to meet that burden. Id.\nThe Commonwealth Court reversed the Board\u2019s decision and concluded that \u201cthe referee\u2019s relevant findings of fact ... [were] supported by substantial evidence, and that the referee correctly determined that the decedent was in the course of employment when he died.\u201d Biddle v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd. (Thomas Mekis & Sons, Inc.), No. 627 C.D. 1991, slip op. at 3 (Pa.Commw. Nov. 18, 1991). Moreover, the court found that the \u201cno fixed place of work\u201d exception to the \u201ccoming and going rule\u201d was applicable and, therefore, reinstated the referee\u2019s grant of benefits. Id. at 6-7. Under, the \u201ccoming and going rule,\u201d \u201can employer is not liable to the employee for compensation for injuries received off the employer\u2019s premise while the employee is travelling to or from work.\u201d Peterson v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd. (PRN Nursing Agency), 528 Pa. 279, 284, 597 A.2d 1116, 1119 (1991) (citations omitted). The general rule in this Commonwealth is that\nan injury sustained while an employee is going to or coming from work does not occur in the course of employment unless one of the following exceptions is shown to exist:\n1) claimant\u2019s employment contract includes transportation to and from work;\n2) claimant has no fixed place of work;\n3) claimant is on a special mission for employer; or\n4) special circumstances are such that claimant was furthering the business of the employer.\nId. at 284-85, 597 A.2d at 1119 (quoting Setley v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., 69 Pa.Commw. 241, 244, 451 A.2d 10, 11 (1982)). In this case, we are concerned only with the \u201cno fixed place of work\u201d exception.\nAppellant argues that a construction site is a fixed place of work under the \u201ccoining and going rule\u201d. Appellant, relying on Schick v. Newspaper Guild of Greater Philadelphia, 25 Pa.Commw. 108, 358 A.2d 127 (1976), avers that Appellee bears the burden of proving that an exception to the \u201ccoining and going rule\u201d is applicable and that she has failed to present evidence which would support a conclusion that the decedent had \u201cno fixed place of work.\u201d\nAppellee argues that the evidence clearly established that the decedent was a project manager who oversaw several jobs at one time and travelled between them. Appellee contends that although the decedent\u2019s last job started in the spring of 1985, there was no evidence that this was the only job site the decedent visited each day.\nIn Peterson v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd. (PRN Nursing Agency), 528 Pa. 279, 597 A.2d 1116 (1991), a practical nurse employed by a nursing agency fractured her left leg and left ankle in an automobile accident while travelling to her assigned workplace. The facts revealed that the nursing agency was in the business of supplying personnel to health care facilities on a temporary basis. Id. at 287, 597 A.2d at 1120. We found that \u201c[a] temporary employee, who is employed by an agency, never has a fixed place of work. Consequently, when the agency employee travelled] to an assigned workplace, the employee [was] furthering the business of the agency.\u201d Id. at 288, 597 A.2d at 1120. We held, as a matter of law, that \u201cAppellant had no fixed place of work, when she was injured, and her injury occurred while she was in furtherance of her employer\u2019s business.\u201d Id. at 288, 597 A.2d at 1120-21. Thus, she was entitled to benefits.\nThis Court also dealt with a similar issue in Hohman v. George H. Soffel Co., 354 Pa. 31, 46 A.2d 475 (1946). In Hohman, the claimant was a plumber who worked for his employer at various places in and around Pittsburgh. The claimant had no regular place of work but traveled from one job to another as instructed by his employer. Id. at 32-33, 46 A.2d at 476. The claimant in Hohman was struck by a passing car one morning while on route to a job site.\nIn Hohman, this Court found that the claimant\u2019s \u201cemployment required him to be at one place one day on the employer\u2019s business and at a different place, perhaps miles distant, for like purpose on another or even a succeeding day.\u201d Id. at 34, 46 A.2d at 476. In Hohman this Court reasoned:\nThe service of the employer\u2019s interest in the circumstances shown necessarily made of the claimant a \u201croving\u201d or \u201citinerant\u201d workman. The travel to and from his home and the place of his current work was not the ordinary travel of a workman between his home and his regular place of work. The claimant\u2019s travel, for which he was reimbursed by his employer, was an essential part of the expeditious performance of his work in the furtherance of the employer\u2019s business, as was also his transportation of the supplies which were stored at his home for his use in his work. Under the established facts of this case, his home rather than his employer\u2019s shop was the usual starting and stopping place of his course of employment. The claimant\u2019s status was analogous to that of a \u201ctravelling salesman\u201d to whom compensation is payable for injuries suffered while going about in the actual furtherance of his employer\u2019s business[.]\nId. at 34-35, 46 A.2d at 476-77 (citations omitted).\nThe factual scenario in the case at bar is dissimilar from both Peterson and Hohman. The instant facts do not support Appellee\u2019s assertion that the decedent had no fixed place of work. The referee determined that the decedent \u201coversaw several jobs at one time, travelling between the jobs.\u201d (Referee\u2019s Findings of Fact; Reproduced Record at 8a). The decedent\u2019s co-worker testified that the decedent travelled around and overlooked three and four jobs at a time. (Reproduced Record at 41a). The findings of fact and the testimony in this case were insufficient to overcome claimant\u2019s burden of proof that an exception to the \u201ccoming and going rule\u201d existed. Testimony that the decedent travelled \u201caround\u201d and \u201coverlooked\u201d three and four jobs at a time gives no indication as to the frequency of travel (i.e., whether the decedent travelled to these three or four job sites daily, weekly, or monthly). We are unable to determine that the \u201cno fixed place of work\u201d exception is applicable because the factual findings as well as the testimony supporting those findings do not reveal the decedent\u2019s travel schedule.\nHere, Appellee has failed to provide sufficient evidence demonstrating that the decedent travelled from work site to work site on a daily basis. Moreover, the record is devoid of any such evidence. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court erred in finding that the \u201cno fixed place of work\u201d exception to the \u201ccoming and going rule\u201d was applicable.\nAccordingly, we reverse the Order of the Commonwealth Court and reinstate the Order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board.\nPAPADAKOS, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nMONTEMURO, J., is sitting by designation.\n. Appellant raised a second issue contending that the Commonwealth Court exceeded its scope of review when it found as a fact that the decedent had no fixed place of work. As noted, we limited allocatur to the issue of whether the circumstances of the decedent's employment supported a conclusion that the decedent had \"no fixed place of work.\" Thus, we will not address the second issue.\n. In Hohman, we did not expressly mention the \u201cno fixed place of work\u201d exception, rather, our rationale concerned whether the injury occurred while the employee was in the furtherance of the employer's business."}
