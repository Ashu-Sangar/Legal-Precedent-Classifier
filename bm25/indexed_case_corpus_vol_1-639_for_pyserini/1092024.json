{"id": "1092024", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Kephart,\nThe decedent and his cousin William were partners in the business of buying and selling live stock under the firm name of C. Gross & Brother. They sueeeeded their respective fathers in the same business in 1912. From that date on, each had employed and paid his brother to work in connection with the business. Christian, the decedent, had charge of the inside, work, including the bookkeeping. His brother Conrad, the claimant, employed by him as a sales clerk, did the original entry work in keeping the firm books. After Christian\u2019s death, Conrad presented a claim against the estate for one-half of what he termed his brother\u2019s share of the net earnings of the partnership. It was based on an alleged agreement by which Christian was to pay Conrad this sum as compensation for the services mentioned. At the end of each month the partners divided a certain part of the earnings, Christian giving one-half of the money received from the firm to his brother, by crediting it to an account kept in Conrad\u2019s name, and for his benefit. The balance has been paid, since Christian\u2019s death. There is no dispute over the monthly division of money received from the firm; the controversy is over Conrad\u2019s right to receive one-half the balance of the so-called profits or earnings which were not paid during the partner\u2019s lifetime.\nThe matter, as it thus presents itself, is resolved into a contest against an estate by one who was in a position to assert his rights long before the death of the other party, at a time when there was sufficient money on hand to pay it, and when the other party, the one most interested, was in being to defend his rights. To successfully assert a claim against a dead man\u2019s estate is being steadily made more difficult. To establish such claim by parol evidence requires proof direct and positive. The terms of the liability must be certain and definite: Caldwell v. Taylor, 276 Pa. 398, 404; Goodhart\u2019s Est., 278 Pa. 381; Hirst\u2019s Est., 274 Pa. 286, 288; Reynolds v. Williams, 282 Pa. 148. As we have often said, \u201cThese claims are always looked on with suspicion,\u201d the burden of proof lies on the claimant: Heffner\u2019s Est., .134 Pa. 436, 444.' Moreover, appellant is also faced with the proposition that, having received a certain sum of money each month, for services, the presumption would he the payment thus received was in full satisfaction of any demand: McConnell\u2019s App., 97 Pa. 31, 34; Houck v. Houck, 99 Pa. 552, 555; Flaccus v. Wood, 260 Pa. 161, 164; Gilbraith\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 288, 290; Winfield v. Beaver Trust Co., 229 Pa. 530; Brown v. McCurdy, 278 Pa. 19, 23.\nThe surviving partner, in support of the claim, testified to a conversation with\u2019 Christian, from which appellant argues a contract may be found. The substantial part of the conversation is as follows: \u201cBill, I want to tell you the arrangement I made with Conrad, my brother.- I agreed to give him one-half of my share of the profits, \u2014 of the coming profits of the business; that is, of the first profits of the business.\u201d\nThe court below, in disallowing the claim, determined this language to be ambiguous in not clearly expressing the intention of the parties, and that, from the manner in which the books were kept, the profits referred to were not-intended to include the earnings not paid, and found that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain an award of one-half of the surplus or earnings account. The profits referred to and here claimed had been set aside in a special account which, at the time of decedent\u2019s death, amounted to $63,000, and was used by the firm for a particular purpose. We agree with these conclusions, and, in addition, we find that William, the surviving partner, on whose testimony main reliance is placed, explained with sufficient accuracy the purpose of the special account. In this connection it may be well to state, as having some bearing on the last phrase above quoted from the decedent (\u201cthat is, of the first profits of the business\u201d), Christian, in keeping a book which showed Conrad\u2019s account also had an account styled \u201cC. Gross & ^Brother.\u201d The entries there made by him clearly distinguished between the earnings of the partnersliip that were paid to him and those that were placed in the surplus account. It further shows that the \u201cfirst profits\u201d had reference to the profits that were divided at the end of each month.\nThese circumstances, in connection with William\u2019s testimony, explaining the purpose of the special fund, evidence that it was never intended to be used as profits, nor to be understood as such, but was always considered by the partners as being a part of the capital without which the firm\u2019s business would be seriously jeopardized. The undertaking of the partners was considered extremely hazardous. At times their profits for a month might be very large, considering of course the character of the enterprise; at other times the firm might suffer a considerable loss. To safeguard against such uncertain and fluctuating conditions, and to protect the partners in their individual estates, it was agreed to create a fund which would automatically take care of such reverses. Accordingly, from the earnings of the company each month or year a certain part was set aside as capital of the company.' Christian styled this account \u201cC. Gross & Brother,\u201d the firm name. William speaks of it in the following language: \u201cWe were doing a very hazardous business at the time, extending our credit very much .....; we thought it a good thing if we could put some of it to one side and when we had a loss, instead of taking it out of the profits [that is, the money divided each month], we could'take it out of that [fund] and in that way we could have no risk.\u201d The special fund or surplus account now in controversy was made up of earnings not divided as profits or considered as such. Instead of taking the monthly losses, or any losses that might occur out of the monthly profits (that is, the first profits) that were given to each partner,:they would be charged against this fund. In this manner the regular monthly division from the first profits that each partner received was assured to them, and their personal estates would in no event be called on to make good any such loss. Indeed, if claimant\u2019s idea was carried out, he would be free from replacing any loss that might occur. In other words, he would participate in the gain, and not share in any loss. Again, William\u2019s explanation refers with much force to the statement, \u201cfirst profits of the business.\u201d\nIt must have been apparent to the auditing judge that when Conrad presented his original bill against the estate for the balance of the monthly cash payments due to him (later paid), and the .conversation ensuing at that time, that, if he had an additional claim against the estate, or had any idea of pressing such a claim, he would not have put himself in the position of presenting in that first charge what was fairly considered his sole account. Ordinarily prudence and caution would have prescribed a different course. Claimant is not in the position of one who did not know; he kept the books and must have known what this account contained. The court below found against the claim. The findings of fact have the force and effect of a verdict of a jury, and will not be disturbed if there is evidence to support them: Glenn v. Trees, 276 Pa. 165, 167-8.\nThe decree is affirmed, costs to be paid by appellant."}
