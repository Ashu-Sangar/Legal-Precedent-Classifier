{"id": "1919665", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nAppellants, owners and occupiers of a dwelling located in Blythe Township, brought a trespass action against the township municipal authority alleging a failure to supply \u201cpure and wholesome water.\u201d The authority filed preliminary objections, consisting of a motion to strike, a motion for a more specific pleading, and a demurrer. The latter was predicated upon the authority\u2019s assertion that a prior action commenced in 1962 by one of the appellants and concluded adversely to her was res judicata of the present action (commenced in December of 1965). The court below agreed that the res judicata defense was meritorious and thus sustained appellees\u2019 demurrer; this appeal was then taken.\nL\nInitially, appellants question the propriety of asserting the defense of res judicata by preliminary objections, contending that the proper vehicle is a responsive pleading, i.e., an answer, containing new matter. Such a course is contemplated by Pa. R. C. P. 1030: \u201cAll affirmative defenses, including . . . res judicata . . . shall be pleaded in a responsive pleading under the heading \u2018New Matter\u2019.\u201d See also Pa. R. C. P. 1045(b). The rationale for this procedure stems from the fact that a court may not ordinarily take judicial notice in one case of the records in another case even though the case arose in the same court and the contents of those records are known to the court. See, e.g., Naffah v. City Deposit Bank, 339 Pa. 157, 13 A. 2d 63 (1940). It follows that, unless the circumstances necessary to sustain the plea of res judicata appear on the face of the complaint, the defense must be raised in an answer and not by preliminary objections. See Jones v. Costlow, 354 Pa. 245, 47 A. 2d 259 (1946). In Jones, for example, the complaint contained no reference to any prior action between the parties. The answer, however, asserted in new matter the defense of res judicata, placing this issue before the court and compelling the plaintiff to file a responsive pleading upon penalty of admitting the facts alleged in the new matter. See also Thal v. Krawitz, 361 Pa. 178, 63 A. 2d 33 (1949).\nAppellees rely on two cases in which the affirmative defense of res judicata was successfully asserted via preliminary objections. In the first of these, Kiely v. J. A. Cunningham Equipment, Inc., 387 Pa. 598, 128 A. 2d 759 (1957), we expressly stated that plaintiff\u2019s complaint made reference to the prior action thus permitting the defense to be raised by preliminary objections. Similarly, the complaint of plaintiff in Fleming v. Strayer, 367 Pa. 284, 80 A. 2d 786 (1951), referred to a prior action. The complaint was then amended to delete any reference to the prior suit; we held, however, that the admission of the existence of a prior judgment still appeared upon the face of the record and permitted defendant to assert a res judicata defense in preliminary objections. We conclude that, since appellants\u2019 complaint makes no reference to the prior 1962 action, appellees should have asserted their affirmative defense of res judicata by new matter contained in an answer to the complaint.\nII.\nAppellees suggest that, if we adopt appellants\u2019 position, unnecessary litigation will be engendered for the court below has already decided the merits of the res judicata claim adversely to appellants. The result of a decision based on procedural grounds alone would result in assertion of the res judicata defense in appellees\u2019 answer at which time the court below would again enter judgment in their favor. We faced a similar problem in Brown v. Hahn, 419 Pa. 42, 50, 213 A. 2d 342, 346 (1965) : \u201cNothing is to be gained by sending the parties back to the trial court to set their procedural house in order before coming once again to this Court with the identical controversy.\u201d We therefore turn to a consideration of whether the court below properly sustained appellees\u2019 plea of res judicata.\nTo support a claim of res judicata the party asserting this defense must show a concurrence of four conditions: (1) identity of the thing sued upon; (2) identity of the cause of action; (3) identity of persons and parties to the action; and (4) identity of the quality or capacity of the parties suing or sued. Stevenson v. Silverman, 417 Pa. 187, 208 A. 2d 786, cert. denied, 382 U.S. 833, 86 S. Ct. 76 (1965). The essential inquiry is whether the ultimate and controlling issues have been decided in a prior proceeding in which the present parties had an opportunity to appear and assert their rights. Hochman v. Mortgage Finance Corp., 289 Pa. 260, 137 Atl. 252 (1927). Applying these tests, we are compelled to conclude that identity of the thing sued upon is here lacking and that, on this state of the record, the ultimate and controlling issues were not decided in the 1962 equity action.\nIn June of 1962 appellants brought an action in equity asserting that appellee authority had failed to provide \u201cpure and wholesome water\u201d and seeking a mandatory injunction directing the authority to provide \u201cpure and wholesome water\u201d to consumers in the village of Tuscarora. The complaint in equity also sought damages caused by the acts of the authority prior to June, 1962. A hearing was held in 1964 on the equity action and, on November 30, 1964, the complaint was dismissed. In his findings of fact the chancellor specifically found that the water served by the authority was then \u201cpotable\u201d and \u201cchemically and bacteriologically wholesome,\u201d although concededly having an unpleasant taste at various times. These findings were based upon tests and reports made by the Department of Health of the Commonwealth and by independent laboratories, all made prior to the opinion date of November 30, 1964.\nNothing then happened for more than a year, until November, 1965, at which time the authority demanded $289.67 from appellants for alleged back water rates with the threat to shut off appellants\u2019 water. Appellants declined to pay and the authority cut off their water on December 6, 1965. Appellants promptly commenced this action of trespass on December 16, 1965 against the authority and its general manager. The complaint asserted the failure to provide \u201cpure and wholesome water\u201d for the period prior to December 6, 1965 and sought money damages in trespass from the authority for allegedly wrongful shutting off of appellants\u2019 service and for refusal to restore the service.\nThe 1962 action was thus brought on the basis that the authority supplied unwholesome water prior to June, 1962. The chancellor\u2019s decision was that the authority\u2019s water was wholesome up to some time in 1964- The 1965 action presented at least one new issue which could not possibly have been decided in the earlier action. Did the authority furnish \u201cpure and wholesome water\u201d during the calendar year 1965?\nNeither the opinion below nor appellees\u2019 brief explain how a finding that wholesome water was furnished some time in the years 1962 to 1964 is res judicata that wholesome water was furnished in the spring, summer and fall of 1965. It may very well be that the 1964 equity adjudication is res judicata as to the wholesomeness of the water up to the date of the last test made in 1964 by the Department of Health or by outside agencies or perhaps even as of the date of the 1964 decree, a question we need not here decide. All that we need note is that the condition of the water may well have changed after the 1964 decree was rendered. In essence, appellants wish to litigate a claim wbicli could not possibly have been raised in the 1962 action and thus can find support in cases such as Rieck Ice Cream Company Appeal, 417 Pa. 249, 209 A. 2d 383 (1965) and Haefele v. Davis, 399 Pa. 504, 160 A. 2d 711 (1960), both of which hold that an adverse adjudication against a party concerning conditions allegedly existing in year \u201cX\u201d is not res judicata of a claim that the conditions which were adjudicated not to exist in year \u201cX\u201d do exist in year \u201cY\u201d, a year not covered by the year \u201cX\u201d adjudication.\nWe express no opinion on the merits of the controversy or whether the appellants can ultimately succeed. We merely decide that they cannot be deprived of their day in court on the ground that the 1964 decision of the chancellor in the 1962 action is res judicata of their present claims as to what happened in 1965. Nor do we express any opinion on the two undecided motions in appellees\u2019 preliminary objections which the court below declined to decide when the demurrer was sustained.\nThe judgment is vacated and the record remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell concurs.\nThe last sentence of tbe Fleming opinion (supra at 289, 80 A. 2d at 789) bas spawned some confusion: \u201cIt may be added that obviously tbe prior judgment would be successfully interposed if tbe preliminary objections were dismissed and tbe appellees required to answer.\u201d A line of Superior Court cases bas apparently read tbis sentence to indicate that, if tbe defense of res judicata will obviously be successful, it may be asserted via preliminary objections. See, e.g., Costa v. Pittsburgh, 177 Pa. Superior Ct. 380, 110 A. 2d 884 (1955). Tbis reasoning would vitiate tbe requirement of Buie 1030 that affirmative defenses be asserted in the new matter section of the answer. If successful, then the party asserting the defense of res judicata could employ preliminary objections; if not successful, then nothing is lost to that party by failure to comply with the rules.\nNor are the only procedural irregularities those of the appellees. If the appellants wished to challenge appellees\u2019 method of raising their res judicata claim, the proper procedure would have been a preliminary objection in the nature of a motion to strike because of lack of conformity to law or rule of court. Just such a procedure is required by Pa. B. O. P. 1017 (b) (2) and is available to challenge improper matter contained in a defendant\u2019s preliminary objections. See Rufo v. The Bastian-Blessing Company, 417 Pa. 107, 207 A. 2d 823 (1965).\nAppellants\u2019 1965 action also contains the additional claim that one o\u00ed the appellants, Mrs. Ann Callery, had a pre-existing heart ailment which was aggravated by the effort expended in carrying water after the authority terminated service to the Callery residence."}
