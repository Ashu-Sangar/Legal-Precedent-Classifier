{"id": "1159054", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nTbe sole question raised in tbis appeal is tbe propriety and validity of a decree of tbe Orphans\u2019 Court of Washington County authorizing tbe payment of costs and attorneys\u2019 fees incident to tbe appointment of a guardian for Georgia Roberts, a weak-minded person. Tbe decree directed that payment be made out of the income accruing to tbe trust estate with tbe right to encroach upon the corpus when and if the fund became available. Tbe action of tbe court below is supported and justified by decedent\u2019s will and is unobjectionable.\nAll other issues injected into tbe case by appellant are irrelevant and have no relation to tbis proceeding.\nTbe decree is affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost."}
