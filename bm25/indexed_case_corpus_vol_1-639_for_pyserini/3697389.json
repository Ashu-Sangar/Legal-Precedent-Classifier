{"id": "3697389", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 27th day of August, 2009, the proposed findings that the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County set forth contemporaneously with its \u201corder\u201d of September 8, 2008 and then referenced in its \u201corder\u201d of December 23, 2008 are hereby rejected. The presiding judge, former Judge Michael T. Conahan, simply adopted appellee George Banks\u2019 counsel\u2019s proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law wholesale as his purported \u201cDetermination on Competency Issues.\u201d That performance violated this Court\u2019s oft-repeated requirement of an autonomous judicial expression of the reasons for granting or denying post-conviction relief. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Williams, 557 Pa. 207, 782 A.2d 1167, 1176 (1999); Commonwealth v. Fulton, 583 Pa. 65, 876 A.2d 342, 345 (2002); Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 581 Pa. 632, 868 A.2d 379, 382-83 (2005); Commonwealth v. Millner, 585 Pa. 237, 888 A.2d 680, 688 (2005); see also Williams, 732 A.2d at 1192 (Castille, J., concurring). Conahan\u2019s adoption of appellee\u2019s proposed findings was doubly improper to the extent that the document includes findings as to questions that were well beyond the scope of the hearing as delineated in this Court\u2019s December 28, 2007 opinion, which: reminded Conahan that he was to serve as this Court\u2019s master to make two discrete competence determinations; specifically directed Conahan \u201cnot to be diverted by tangential motions and assertions by counsel\u201d; and emphasized that \u201cthis Court retained] jurisdiction over such matters,\u201d Commonwealth v. Banks, 596 Pa. 297, 943 A.2d 230, 232, 239 (2007). See, e.g., Determination on Competency Issues, 9/8/08, \u00b6 30 (finding that appellee\u2019s prognosis is \u201chopeless\u201d); id. \u00b6 58 (finding that appellee has \u201cgeneral lack of competency\u201d and requires next friend for purposes of any further proceedings); id. \u00b6 59 (finding that appellee\u2019s mother, Mary Yelland, is appropriate next friend).\nIn the ordinary course, we would return the case to the hearing judge for an autonomous judicial expression, but such a course is unavailable here, as Conahan subsequently has been removed from the bench by order of this Court. Accordingly, while continuing to retain plenary jurisdiction, we refer this matter to the Honorable Chester B. Muroski, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne County, for assignment to another judge of that court to hold a de novo competency hearing as expeditiously as possible. The trial court is referred to our decision in Banks, supra, concerning the very limited parameters of the hearing. See supra. A brief report on the progress of the proceeding is to be provided to this Court on a monthly basis. Jurisdiction retained."}
