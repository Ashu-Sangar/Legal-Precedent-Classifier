{"id": "477418", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb\u00a1 Justice Linn,\nNext of kin appeal from an.order of distribution made on the adjudication of the account of the executor of J. Allan Donaldson. The appellants are his adoptive first cousins. He died March 31, 1947, . about seven months after , his wife\u2019s, death. They left no issue. The plan of his will was simple: to provide an income for his wife for life if she. survived him and to give the residue to the University of Pennsylvania and the Harrisburg Polyclinic. Hospital whether she survived him or not. He made one .other gift; he provided in paragraph 3 that his wife should receive \u201call of my jewelry, wearing apparel, automobile or automobiles and. other personal effects which I may own at the time of my decease. Should my wife predecease me, my executor shall have the power to distribute such personal .effects among my. next of kin ...\u201d If. she survived (paragraph 4) \u201call of the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal, or mixed\u201d would go to the accountant to pay the net income to her for life. Paragraph 5 specified the terms of the trust created in paragraph 4. In paragraph 6, a residuary provision, he directed conversion of \u201call of the assets of the trust into cash as soon as can be done\u201d after the death of his wife, if she survived him, and the payment of \u201cthe net proceeds thereof\u201d to the University and the Hospital. In paragraph. 7, an alternative residuary provision, he directed that on his death, his wife having predeceased him, his executer should \u201cconvert all of the assets of my estate into cash . . .\u201d and distribute to the two charities. Paragraph S.provided disposition in the event of their deaths in a Common disaster, etc.\n1. Appellants contend that the gift in paragraph 3 \u00f3f \u201call of my jewelry,-wearing apparel, automobile or automobiles and other personal effects . . .\u201d includes household furniture and furnishings; though not mentioned in the gift. That conclusion is reached by contending that the words \u201cand other personal effects\u201d include, by the rule ejusdem generis, household furniture and furnishings. President Judge Richards properly rejected this contention as inconsistent with the apparent intention expressed in the will read as a whole. Personal effects, on the one hand, and household furniture and furnishings on the other, may constitute two classes of objects and have been so considered in our cases. In Lippincott\u2019s Estate, 173 Pa. 368, 371, 34 A. 58 (1896), it was said: \u201cThe phrase \u2018personal effects\u2019 has obtained, by frequent use, as distinctly a defined meaning as the phrase \u2018household effects.\u2019 It designates articles associated with the person, just as the opposite phrase denotes articles belonging to the house.\u201d Household furniture may be and generally is personal property but not all personal property is included in the more restricted term \u201cpersonal effects.\u201d The rule ejusdem gen\u00e9ris, if applied to the words \u201call of my jewelry [and] wearing apparel,\u201d would certainly not include the furniture and furnishings in testator\u2019s residence; nor do the words \u201cautomobile or automobiles\u201d suggest it. The phrase \u201cand other personal effects\u201d in the context obviously has a less comprehensive meaning than the broader phraseology considered in McGlathery\u2019s Estate, 311 Pa. 351, 166 A. 886 (1933) in which the words were not \u201cpersonal effects\u201d but \u201call my personal property including jewelry, clothing, etc., and in addition thereto, I bequeath unto [the same beneficiary] the sum of three thousand ($3,000)\u201d subject to paying burial expenses. In that case we adopted the opinion filed in the court below by Judge Gest, the auditing judge. He said, (page 355) that the \u201cwords \u2018et cetera\u2019 following the enumeration of the particular thing, jewelry and clothing, are confined to articles ejusdem generis only and the household furniture would pass under the bequest . . . The meaning of \u2018including\u2019 is somewhat ambiguous . . . The use of the general term \u2018personal property\u2019 would, as above stated, include all her personalty in a strict legal meaning, but the following gift to [the same beneficiary] is, in my opinion, conclusive of the question, for she proceeds \u2018and in addition thereto I bequeath unto [the same beneficiary] the sum of three thousand dollars . . . Now, the prior gift being of \u2018all my personal property,\u2019 it is in my opinion impossible to hold that the gift of $3,000, \u2018in addition thereto\u2019, did not, in its express language, indicate something else besides the gift of all her personal property including jewelry, clothing, etc., because the words \u2018in addition thereto\u2019, clearly referred to something besides that which had already been given. . . In Reimer\u2019s Estate, 159 Pa. 212, 28 A. 186 (1893) the testator included the words \u201cfurniture etc.\u201d while in Moore\u2019s Estate, 241 Pa. 253, 88 A. 432 (1913) the words were \u201call my personal property.\u201d Judge Bichards held that the testator\u2019s household furniture and furnishings passed under the residuary words \u201call other assets\u201d contained in paragraph 7.\n2. Appellants\u2019 second point is that there was partial intestacy under paragraph 7. They contend that the \u201cgift to the University and the Hospital is limited to the proceeds of the conversion of assets other than real estate and business interests.\u201d They argue that the only dispositive language, aside from paragraph 3 dealing with personal effects, is in paragraph 7. We shall therefore quote it. \u201c7. If my said wife, Helen Bay Donaldson, shall predecease me, I direct my executor to convert all of the assets of my estate into cash. With respect to real estate, or any interest therein, which I may own at the time of my death, or any business enterprise which I may own at such time, I direct my executor to dispose of the .same in the same manner and. with the same powers and authority as hereinbefore conferred upon my , trustees with respect , to such: items. All other assets shall, be converted into cash as soon as this can be accomplished without sacrifice'to the estate and the total net proceeds: shall be divided equally between the Trustees of the-University.-,of Pennsylvania located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the Harrisburg Polyclinic Hospital located in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, such funds to be used for-such capital improvements or endowment purposes. as may . be determined by the governing boards of said institutions.\u201d\nAppellants contend (1)-\u201cthat there is, no gift of the real estate holdings and business interests, nor of the proceeds of their sale; and.that, therefore, an intestacy, as to these assets of the. estate,results; (2) that, since only proceeds of sale ar.e. given to the two beneficiaries, there is no gift of cash and items equivalent to. cash, or of any income, that are not the: subjects of .sale or conversion, and that an intestacy as to those items results.\u201d Those contentions ignore the comparatively simple plan of \u25a0 testamentary disposition. Testator was obviously disposing of all his property not previously given in paragraph 3. Paragraph 6 was a residuary provision disposing of all. his property after the death of his wife, in case she survived him; paragraph 7 is the residuary provision applicable if-he.survived-his wife: compare Noble\u2019s Estate, 344 Pa. 81, 82, 23 A. 2d 410 (1942) ; Bricker\u2019s Estate, 335 Pa. 300, 6 A. 2d 905 (1939); Armstrong Estate, 347 Pa. 23, 31 A. 2d 528 (1943). In the first sentence.testator dealt with \u201call the assets.of my estate\u201d by directing the executor to . convert them into cash. In the two other sentences composing paragraph 7, he divided \u201call the assets of my estate\u201d into two classes for purposes of additional instruction to his executor. Tlxe first class was \u201creal estate, or any interest therein ... or any business enterprise which I may own . . .\u201d at the time of death. The second class included the assets other than \u201creal estate, or any interest therein . . . or any business enterprise which I may own . . .\u201d The property in the second class was then described by the phrase \u201call other assets\u201d as to the conversion of which he gave his executor broader discretionary powers than the law might have implied. The immediately succeeding phraseology \u201cand the total net proceeds\u201d quite obviously refers to the net proceeds received in the conversion of both classes, that is to say of \u201call of the assets of my estate,\u201d wliich was the subject of the residuary paragraph 7. The mere fact that the scrivener used the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d in the third sentence providing for the equal division of \u201cthe total net proceeds\u201d instead of providing for it by a separate sentence beginning \u201cthe total net proceeds shall be divided\u201d is not sufficient to carry the meaning which the appellants would attribute to it becaus\u00e9 the argument ignores the relation of \u201cthe total net proceeds\u201d to what preceded in the first and second sentences of paragraph 7, and to the alternative provision in the contingency dealt with in paragraph 6. See Bricher\u2019s Estate, 335 Pa. 300, 6 A. 2d 905 (1939). The full meaning of the word \u201ctotal\u201d in the context cannot be ignored: cf. Calder\u2019s Estate, 343 Pa. 30, 37-38, 21 A. 2d 907 (1941); Byrne\u2019s Estate, 320 Pa. 513, 519, 181 A. 500 (1935); Shipley\u2019s Estate No. 2, 337 Pa. 580, 584, 12 A. 2d 347 (1940). The conjunction \u201cand\u201d merely takes the place of a full stop and unites the two parts of paragraph 7-M;he direction to convert \u201call the assets of my estate into cash\u201d and the direction to divide the net proceeds equally between the two charities.\n3. In paragraph 6, as stated above, testator gave the charities the net proceeds to be realized, on his wife\u2019s death if she survived him, by converting the assets of the trust, that is by reducing them to cash. The words of paragraph 7 must be read with paragraph 6 in mind, because both were parts of the disposition of his entire residue in the contingencies respectively provided for. In reading the whole will to ascertain the intention of the testator, the court may not disregard a provision merely because a contingency rendered it inoperative. To say, as appellants also contend, that by the words used the testator did not dispose of cash on hand and investments in securities because cash and securities were not specified by the use of the words \u201ccash and securities\u201d is to ignore the realities of the testator\u2019s conduct in disposing of the residue of his estate remaining after providing for his wife. The cash and the securities passed for what they were in the designations \u201call of the assets of my trust\u201d (in the contingency expressed in paragraph 6) and \u201call of the assets of my estate\u201d (in the contingency expressed in paragraph 7).. Compare Appeal of the Boards of Missions of the United Presbyterian Church, 91 Pa. 507 (1879); Gibbons\u2019s Estate, 224 Pa. 37, 73 A. 183 (1909).\nIt is significant that appellants have not contended that paragraph 6, if the wife survived, resulted in partial, intestacy; the will is too clearly against such a construction. But they would disregard the effect of paragraph 6 in their claim of partial intestacy under paragraph 7, the contingent counterpart of paragraph 6; that paragraph must be considered if it aids in showing what the words of the will mean. Counsel for the University, in the course of his argument, points to paragraph 8 as supporting testator\u2019s intention not to die intestate in any contingency. That paragraph provides, \u201cIn the event that my wife and I shall die in a common disaster, or under such circumstances that it cannot be readily determined which of us died first; or if my wife, regardless of the cause of her death shall survive me for less than thirty days, she shall be deemed not to have survived me whether or not I actually predecease her.\u201d Counsel suggests that: \u201cThe desperate unlikelihood of Appellants\u2019 position is further illustrated by its application to a case where Article 8 of the will might have become applicable. They are forced to the conclusion that testator intended a complete disposition of his real estate and business if his wife survived him by 31 days, but that if she survived him by only 29 days testator did not intend such disposition, but to die intestate as to a large part of his estate.\u201d\nDecree affirmed; costs to be paid by appellant.\nThe. opinion of the court below is reported in 59 Dauphin County Reporter 236 (1948).\nHe awarded to the next of kin the jewelry, wearing apparel, automobiles and personal effects but not the household furniture and furnishings.\nOf this class alon\u00e9, one the briefs stated, \u201cThe testator\u2019s real estate togeth\u00e9r with-his business aggregated about half a-million dollars:\u2019\u2019 - - ,\nThe account shows that the appraisement of all testator\u2019s property for Pennsylvania inheritance tax purposes was over $888,000.00.\nIn this case it was said: \u201cThe testator, for the benefit of his donees, directed that his entire residuary estate should be converted into money, but if-part of it is found in the shape of money, it needs no conversion and surely not the less does it pass to the legatees.\u201d"}
