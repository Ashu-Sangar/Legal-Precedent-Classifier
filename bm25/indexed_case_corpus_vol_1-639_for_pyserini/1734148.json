{"id": "1734148", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nAppellant was convicted after a trial by jury of murder of the second degree, burglary and robbery. He contends that the trial testimony of two witnesses should have been suppressed as the fruit of a confession held illegal at a pre-trial suppression hearing. Appellant, however, did not object at trial to the admission of the testimony of the witnesses. Consequently, the issue has been waived. See e. g., Commonwealth v. Sparrow, 471 Pa. 490, 370 A.2d 712 (1977); Commonwealth v. Brown, 467 Pa. 512, 359 A.2d 393 (1976).\nJudgment of sentence affirmed."}
