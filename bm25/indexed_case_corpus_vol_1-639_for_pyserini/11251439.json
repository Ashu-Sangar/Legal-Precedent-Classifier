{"id": "11251439", "contents": "OpikioN,\nMk. Justice Mitchell:\nThe learned judge below restricted the liability of defendant to the case of his knowledge and participation in the fraud of Chambers. But this is much too narrow a line for the circumstances. The coffee was ordered in defendant\u2019s name, was sent to him by plaintiffs with a bill or statement in the regular course of business, and he had immediate knowledge of all the facts by his interview with Chambers. Instead of repudiating the transaction and promptly notifying plaintiffs, he accepted Chambers\u2019s explanation and permitted him to carry out his plan. This was a clear loan of his credit to Chambers, and of itself would have made defendant liable. But, to put the matter beyond all question, the defendant received a second and a third bill, and in response to the latter sent his check for about half the amount, and promised \u201c the balance in a few days.\u201d A plainer case of ratification can hardly be imagined.\nThere is another ground, entirely distinct, but equally conclusive of defendant\u2019s liability. The act of Chambers was a fraud; and, assuming the entire innocence of defendant, nevertheless he allowed a state of facts to be represented to plaintiffs which was not true, and thereby he put into Chambers\u2019s hand the means of successfully carrying out tbe fraud. It is no doubt bis misfortune tbat he had confidence in Chambers, but nothing is better settled than that, as between these two innocent parties, the one whose conduct gave the means of perpe* trating the fraud must bear the loss.\nThe evidence of the unusual character of an order for a- ton of coffee at that place, and the evidence of another similar transaction on the part of Chambers at a little subsequent date, were alike irrelevant and immaterial. The custom of other dealers, or even of this defendant previously, had no bearing on a perfectly plain order for a definite quantity, given in defendant\u2019s name and plainly ratified by him. A merchant who receives an unusually large order may, as a business precaution, consider the advisability of filling it; but, to say that its unusual size is notice, or anything to put him upon inquiry of fraud, would be giving other people\u2019s custom a potency to interfere with every man\u2019s business which has never yet been accorded to it.\nJudgment reversed, and venire de novo awarded."}
