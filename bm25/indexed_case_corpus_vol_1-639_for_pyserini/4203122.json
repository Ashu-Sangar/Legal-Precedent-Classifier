{"id": "4203122", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nRalph Birdsong appeals from the order denying his petition for relief pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. We affirm.\nAppellant was charged with first degree murder and related offenses for fatally shooting two people, seriously wounding six others, and raping a teenage girl during a brutal incident on July 17,1988. Appellant waived his right to a jury at both the guilt and penalty phases and was tried jointly with his brother Anthony, who was his co-conspirator. The trial court convicted appellant of two counts of first degree murder, six counts of aggravated assault, and one count each of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, conspiracy, and possession of an instrument of crime.\nAt the penalty phase, the trial court found no mitigating circumstances and two aggravating circumstances: 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9) (defendant has significant history of felony convictions involving use or threat of violence to person) and 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(ll) (defendant has been convicted of another murder committed in any jurisdiction either before or at time of offense at issue). Accordingly, the trial court imposed a death sentence for murder and a consecutive term of 52)6 to 105 years imprisonment for the other offenses.\nAppellant received new counsel and filed a direct appeal. This Court concluded appellant\u2019s claims were meritless and affirmed. Birdsong, supra.\nAppellant filed a timely pro se PCRA petition and received new counsel, who filed an amended petition October 17, 1996. In April, 1997, counsel filed another amended petition, and the Commonwealth moved to dismiss. In the interim, the trial judge died, and a new judge was appointed for the PCRA proceedings. Following evidentiary hearings between September, 1999 and January, 2000, the PCRA court issued a notice of intent to dismiss appellant\u2019s petition as meritless; the court dismissed the petition February 26, 2001.\nAppellant filed this appeal; on April 26, 2002, this Court remanded to the PCRA court for preparation of an opinion, tolling the briefing schedule but retaining jurisdiction. In August, 2002, appellant filed a motion requesting this Court to expand the scope of the remand to include a new claim under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002) (execution of mentally retarded criminals violates Eighth Amendment), which this Court granted. The briefing schedule resumed, and the case was submitted for decision June 4, 2008. When no PCRA court opinion had been filed as directed, this Court again remanded to the PCRA court on November 19, 2003, for preparation of an opinion, citing Commonwealth v. Brown, 574 Pa. 231, 830 A.2d 536, 537 (2003) (\u201cIn capital, post-conviction appeals, this Court has recently emphasized the necessity of ... an adequate written opinion of the PCRA court ... as ... necessary to provide the essential predicate for appellate review of the post-conviction proceedings by this Court.\u201d).\nThe PCRA court filed an opinion March 25, 2004, in which it addressed all of appellant\u2019s issues except for the Atkins claim, and noted the parties agreed to further continuances until the General Assembly issued legislation regarding what objective facts should be used to determine the prevailing standards of competency and the degree of mental retardation which would prohibit imposition of the death penalty. PCRA Court Opinion, 3/25/04, at 8-9. The court adopted the American Association of Mental Retardation\u2019s (AAMR) definition of mental retardation, as set forth in the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.1992) (DSM-IV), but did not address the merits of appellant\u2019s Atkins claim, instead advising the parties to prepare any defense testimony on the iss\u00fae of mental retardation. PCRA Court Opinion, 3/25/04, at 9.\nOn June 23, 2004, a hearing was held before the PCRA court; the Commonwealth argued appellant\u2019s Atkins claim was not properly before the PCRA court because this Court had retained jurisdiction. N.T. Status Hearing, 6/23/04, at 4-6. The PCRA court agreed, and dismissed the claim without prejudice. Id., at 6. Thus, there was no lower court ruling on the merits of appellant\u2019s Atkins claim.\nThis Court then decided Commonwealth v. Miller, 585 Pa. 144, 888 A.2d 624 (2005), adopting a definition of \u201cmental retardation\u201d and setting forth the procedure to follow when a defendant asserts an Atkins claim, as guidance from the legislature was not forthcoming. See id., at 629-31. As the PCRA court had never ruled on the merits of appellant\u2019s Atkins claim, we remanded to the PCRA court to make credibility determinations and findings of fact on the merits, in accordance with the guidelines in Miller.\nBy order dated December 12, 2008, the PCRA court noted, \u201c[Appellant] withdraws his Atkins/Miller claim (against advice of counsel). [Appellant] also withdraws all claims with regard to conflict of interests (with present counsel) and ineffectiveness (of present counsel) and wishes his appeals to proceed with current counsel on all other issues already presented.\u201d PCRA Court Order, 12/12/08. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s remaining issues are now properly before us for review.\nIn reviewing an order granting or denying post-conviction relief, we examine whether the PCRA court\u2019s determination is supported by the evidence and whether it is free of legal error. Commonwealth v. Williams, 557 Pa. 207, 732 A.2d 1167, 1176 (1999). To be entitled to relief under the PCRA, appellant must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his conviction or sentence resulted from one or more of the enumerated errors or defects found in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2), his claims have not been previously litigated or waived, id., \u00a7 9543(a)(3), and \u201cthe failure to litigate the issue prior to or during trial, ... or on direct appeal could not have been the result of any rational, strategic or tactical decision by counsel.\u201d Id., \u00a7 9543(a)(4). An issue is previously litigated if \u201cthe highest appellate court in which the petitioner could have had review as a matter of right has ruled on the merits of the issue____\u201d Id., \u00a7 9544(a)(2). An issue is waived \u201cif the petitioner could have raised it but failed to do so before trial, at trial, during unitary review, on appeal, or in a prior state postconviction proceeding.\u201d Id., \u00a7 9544(b).\nAppellant claims ineffectiveness of trial and appellate counsel and trial court error; he also asserts he was denied full and fair collateral review at his PCRA hearing, and that the Commonwealth violated Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194,10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963) (prosecution\u2019s suppression of evidence favorable to accused violates due process where evidence is material to guilt or punishment, irrespective of prosecution\u2019s good or bad faith).\nBrady Claim\nAppellant argues the Commonwealth withheld material evidence favorable to the defense, in violation of Brady. He claims the Commonwealth failed to disclose: (1) Commonwealth witness Andre Kinard was offered immunity from unrelated criminal charges in exchange for his identification testimony against appellant; (2) the Commonwealth placed several key witnesses in a witness protection program, which provided them with free housing, stipends for living expenses, and relocation to another city; (3) electronic surveillance purportedly establishing members of one of appellant\u2019s rival drug factions planned to assassinate another drug dealer; and (4) the results of tests comparing appellant\u2019s blood and saliva samples with those recovered from the rape victim.\nTo establish a Brady violation, a defendant must show: the prosecution suppressed the evidence, either willfully or inadvertently; the evidence is favorable to the defense; and the evidence is material. See Commonwealth v. Chambers, 570 Pa. 3, 807 A.2d 872, 887 (2002). \u201c[E]vidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d Id., at 887-88 (quoting United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985)). \u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish materiality in the constitutional sense.\u201d Id., at 887 (quoting United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 109-10, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976)).\nAppellant points to Andre Kinard\u2019s PCRA testimony that the Commonwealth threatened to charge him with drug and weapons offenses if he did not identify appellant at trial as the shooter, and that he could not identify the shooter. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/7/00, at 6-8. Appellant does not say how this evidence would have affected the outcome of his trial; he appears to argue it would have impeached Kinard. Appellant overlooks the fact that recantation testimony is \u201cexceedingly unreliable,\u201d and \u201cthere is no less reliable form of proof, especially when it involves an admission of perjury.\u201d Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, 553 Pa. 485, 720 A.2d 79, 99 (1998) (quoting Commonwealth v. Anderson, 466 Pa. 339, 353 A.2d 384, 386 (1976)). Given Kinard\u2019s testimony that he perjured himself at trial, and the factors surrounding his recantation, the record supports the PCRA court\u2019s determination this witness was not credible, see Abw-Jamal, at 99 (credibility issues are within sole domain of trier of fact, who personally observed witness\u2019s demeanor) (citation omitted); thus, this proffered evidence does not meet the materiality test.\nAppellant contends the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to disclose that it placed witnesses in a protection program and provided them with living expenses and immunity prejudiced his case because if trial counsel had known these facts, he would have insisted on a jury trial; a jury would have been more likely to be influenced by such information than a judge. Appellant fails to acknowledge that none of these witnesses recanted their identification of him as the shooter in their affidavits for the PCRA court, and the reason they had to be placed in protection programs was because they feared returning to the neighborhood where the murder occurred after they identified appellant. Such evidence would have raised the inference that appellant or one of his cohorts would retaliate; as it would not have changed the result at trial in appellant\u2019s favor, it was not material.\nAppellant next alleges the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to disclose electronic surveillance tapes and transcripts supposedly establishing the Junior Black Mafia (JBM), a rival gang, planned to shoot one of appellant\u2019s rival drug dealers prejudiced his case; he argues this information supported the defense that someone else shot the victim during a botched assassination attempt on the rival dealer. Appellant failed to demonstrate such surveillance evidence existed; he based his assertion on several newspaper articles published at the time of the shooting, which stated the police were investigating the JBM. As appellant failed to prove the evidence he sought exists, his claim was properly rejected.\nFinally, appellant contends he was prejudiced by the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to disclose the results of blood and saliva tests comparing his samples to semen samples recovered from the rape victim; he claims this evidence would have discredited the rape victim\u2019s identification testimony and eliminated one of the aggravating circumstances. However, appellant failed to establish such comparative tests were ever performed; the Commonwealth informed the PCRA court no tests were performed because no testable blood groups were found in the semen taken from the victim. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/8/99, at 46. This enabled appellant to argue there was no physical evidence linking him to the rape; accordingly, this claim was properly rejected.\nIneffectiveness Claims\nRegarding appellant\u2019s ineffectiveness claims, we note several of the issues underlying these claims were addressed on direct appeal; specifically, we addressed trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to move for change of venue, and trial court error in denying appellant\u2019s request to reopen the penalty phase so he could present expert mental health testimony. However, to the extent appellant now alleges appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in connection with these issues, his issues are distinct from those raised on direct appeal and have not been previously litigated. See Commonwealth v. Collins, 585 Pa. 45, 888 A.2d 564, 570, 573 (2005) (term \u201cissue\u201d as used in \u00a7\u00a7 9543(a)(3) and 9544(a)(2) \u201crefers to the discrete legal ground that was forwarded on direct appeal and would have entitled the defendant to relief ....\u201d; ineffectiveness claims are distinct from claims raised on direct appeal and must be treated as wholly independent of underlying claim of error).\nRegarding waiver, appellant\u2019s present issues concerning trial court error and trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness were not raised at trial or on direct appeal; thus, these claims are waived. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b). However, appellant may obtain relief if he can show appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue these claims. See Commonwealth v. Rush, 576 Pa. 3, 838 A.2d 651, 656 (2003) (citing Commonwealth v. McGill, 574 Pa. 574, 832 A.2d 1014, 1022 (2003) (when court is faced with \u201clayered\u201d ineffectiveness claim, only viable ineffectiveness claim is that related to most recent, appellate counsel)).\nTo preserve a \u201clayered\u201d ineffectiveness claim,\na petitioner must \u201cplead, in his PCRA petition,\u201d that appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to raise all prior counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. Additionally, a petitioner must \u201cpresent argument on, i.e. develop each prong of the [Commonwealth v.] Pierce [, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987) ] test\u201d as to appellate counsel\u2019s deficient representation. \u201cThen, and only then, has the petitioner preserved a layered claim of ineffectiveness for the court to review; then, and only then, can the court proceed to determine whether the petitioner has proved his layered claim.\u201d\nId. (citations and footnote omitted); see also McGill, at 1021-23.\nThe Pierce test requires appellant to prove, with respect to appellate counsel\u2019s performance, that: (1) the underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness has arguable merit; (2) appellate counsel had no reasonable basis for failing to pursue the claim; and (3) but for appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, the result on direct appeal would have differed. See id., at 1022-23. This \u201cperformance and prejudice\u201d test was enunciated in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and was recognized in Pierce as the proper test under the Pennsylvania Constitution. Failure to establish any prong of the test will defeat an ineffectiveness claim. Commonwealth v. Basemore, 560 Pa. 258, 744 A.2d 717, 738 n. 23 (2000) (citing Commonwealth v. Rollins, 558 Pa. 532, 738 A.2d 435, 441 (1999) (ordinarily, post-conviction claim of ineffective assistance of counsel may be denied by showing petitioner\u2019s evidence fails to meet single one of three prongs for claim)).\nAppellant\u2019s PCRA petition and appellate brief were filed prior to McGill and Rush\u2019s clarification of the pleading and preservation requirements for layered ineffectiveness claims. In his PCRA petition, appellant did not plead layered ineffectiveness in connection with every issue; instead, he relied on the relaxed waiver principle formerly employed by this Court in capital appeals, which was in effect at the time he filed his petition. See PCRA Petition, at 5-8. Appellant\u2019s appellate brief includes a catch-all, boilerplate assertion of all prior counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to litigate these issues, see Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 7, and he presents argument on his underlying claims of trial error and trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, satisfying the first prong of Pierce with respect to appellate counsel; however, his development of the remaining two prongs regarding appellate counsel\u2019s stewardship is cursory.\nWhere an appellant has established the arguable merit of his claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, the first prong of Pierce with respect to appellate counsel, remand may be warranted to develop the remaining two prongs. Rush, at 656-57. \u201cNevertheless, there is simply no need to remand a PCRA petition when the petitioner has not carried his Pierce burden in relation to the underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, since even if the petitioner were able to craft a perfectly layered argument in support of his claim, the petitioner\u2019s claim would not entitle him to relief.\u201d Id., at 657-58, 576 Pa. 3.\nAs discussed below, all of appellant\u2019s underlying claims of trial court error and trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness fail; his claims of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness are necessarily defeated as well. McGill, at 1023. Therefore, we need not remand to develop the remaining two prongs of Pierce with respect to appellate counsel. See Rush, at 657-58; McGill, at 1025. We now address appellant\u2019s remaining claims, which we have reworded and reordered for ease of discussion.\nGuilt Phase\nWhether the trial judge should have recused herself on the basis of bias.\nAppellant claims the trial judge was biased against him because she was aware of his juvenile record and had presided over numerous cases involving appellant\u2019s siblings in juvenile and family court. He claims trial counsel should have discovered the judge\u2019s bias and filed a recusal motion, and appellate counsel should have raised this issue on direct appeal. In the alternative, and in curious juxtaposition, appellant claims the trial judge failed to consider this background evidence as a mitigating circumstance under \u00a7 9711(e)(8)\u2019s \u201ccatch-all\u201d mitigator.\n\u201cIt is the burden of the party requesting recusal to produce evidence establishing bias, prejudice or unfairness which raises a substantial doubt as to the jurist\u2019s ability to preside impartially.\u201d Abur-Jamal, at 89. Here, there was no recusal request by counsel; appellant claims appellate counsel should have cited trial counsel\u2019s failure to investigate the trial judge\u2019s familiarity with appellant\u2019s family and move for recusal. The evidence appellant presented in support of this claim at the PCRA hearing, however, was paltry and insubstantial, consisting of affidavits by appellant\u2019s father and some of his siblings. The PCRA court concluded appellant\u2019s father\u2019s affidavit could not be admitted as substantive evidence because it was not subject to cross-examination, and the court could not determine the witness\u2019s credibility. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/21/00, at 12-13. The court noted petitioner\u2019s siblings\u2019 affidavits were unsworn, not notarized, and made only vague claims they remembered the trial judge presiding over some of their siblings\u2019 family court cases. PCRA Court Opinion, 3/25/04, at 17.\nThe allegedly prejudicial trial rulings appellant cites do not demonstrate an inability by the jurist to render an impartial verdict; \u201c[a]dverse rulings alone do not ... establish the requisite bias....\u201d Abu-Jamal, at 90. The rulings appellant complains of demonstrate nothing more than the judge\u2019s efforts to manage the trial and her courtroom. Regarding appellant\u2019s alternative claim that the judge should have considered her alleged prior courtroom encounters with his family as mitigating evidence under \u00a7 9711(e)(8), the judge was under no duty to consider mitigating evidence not presented at the penalty phase; such evidence was outside the record. Appellant essentially argues it would have been acceptable for the judge to be biased, as long as it was in his favor. Appellant\u2019s recusal claim is meritless; therefore, remand for further development regarding appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is not warranted. McGill, at 1025.\nWhether appellant was entitled to a change of venue on the basis of pre-trial publicity through electronic media coverage.\nAppellant claims appellate counsel was ineffective for not mentioning the electronic media coverage in arguing trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to move for change of venue; on direct appeal, appellate counsel only mentioned the print media coverage appellant\u2019s case received. Appellant points to appellate counsel\u2019s failure to cite any tactic for this omission. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/7/99, at 27-28.\n\u201cThe mere existence of pretrial publicity does not warrant a presumption of prejudice.\u201d Commonwealth v. Chambers, 546 Pa. 370, 685 A.2d 96, 103 (1996) (citations omitted). This Court noted, in determining whether pre-trial publicity was inherently prejudicial:\n[O]ur inquiry must focus upon whether any juror formed a fixed opinion of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence as a result of the pre-trial publicity. Pre-trial publicity will be deemed inherently prejudicial where the publicity is sensational, inflammatory, slanted towards conviction rather than factual and objective; revealed that the accused had a criminal record; referred to confessions, admissions or reenactments of the crime by the accused; or derived from reports from the police and prosecuting officers.\nCommonwealth v. Marinelli, 547 Pa. 294, 690 A2d 203, 213 (1997) (quoting Commonwealth v. Paolello, 542 Pa. 47, 665 A.2d 439, 450 (1995)).\nIf any of these factors exists, the publicity is deemed to be inherently prejudicial, and we must inquire whether the publicity has been so extensive, so sustained, and so pervasive that the community must be deemed to have been saturated with it. Finally, even if there has been inherently prejudicial publicity which has saturated the community, no change of venue is warranted if the passage of time has sufficiently dissipated the prejudicial effects of the publicity.\nChambers, at 103 (citations omitted).\nBecause appellant waived his right to a jury at the guilt phase, there was no danger any jurors would have a fixed opinion about his guilt; however, he argues he waived a jury at this stage because trial counsel failed to move for a change of venue. He claims the pervasive television and radio publicity about the crime and his apprehension in Florida was inflammatory and sensational, and revealed his prior criminal record; thus, he was afraid to be tried in the county where the residents were exposed to such media coverage.\nThe record belies this claim; although appellant\u2019s brother expressed concern that pre-trial publicity would make it impossible to pick a fair jury and that was why he was waiving his right to a jury, see N.T. Trial, 10/18/89, at 23, 37-38, appellant never voiced such concern, and he expressly affirmed his decision to waive a jury was his own, made freely, and that he was satisfied with counsel\u2019s performance. See id., at 5, 22, 24-26, 38-39. Additionally, trial counsel testified he feared a change of venue to a more remote area would have resulted in a venire panel which would have been more horrified by the facts of the crime than one from urban Philadelphia. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/13/99, at 179-81; id., at 180 (\u201cWe figured if we filed a motion for change of venue, the worst thing would happen is they would grant it.\u201d). Thus, as trial counsel\u2019s strategy was reasonable, appellant\u2019s claim concerning appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness fails; remand for further development is unnecessary. McGill, at 1025.\nWhether the Commonwealth\u2019s initiation of forfeiture proceedings deprived appellant of counsel of his choice.\nAppellant contends he was denied his right to counsel of his choice when the Commonwealth seized assets he would have used to pay counsel. The Commonwealth initiated civil forfeiture proceedings against appellant for seizure of his personal and real property related to drug charges pending against him. Appellant claims he would have used these assets to pay the private attorney he had retained, but was instead forced to rely on appointed counsel, who was inadequately compensated and lacked the resources to defend a very complex, protracted matter involving multiple criminal prosecutions and forfeiture actions. The PCRA court held this claim was not cognizable under the PCRA, as claims based on civil forfeiture proceedings are not included in \u00a7 9543(a)(3)\u2019s grounds for relief. See PCRA Court Opinion, 3/25/04, at 15. However, appellant argues trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to raise the claim; thus, it is a cognizable, legally discrete issue. See Collins, at 570-73.\nAppellant relies on Commonwealth v. Hess, 532 Pa. 607, 617 A.2d 307 (1992), which held application of the forfeiture statute, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6801(a)(6)(i)(A), to funds received by an attorney as a retainer to represent the defendant violated the defendant\u2019s right to counsel under Pa. Const, art. I, \u00a7 9. See Hess, at 313-15. In Hess, however, the funds were already paid to retain the attorney representing the defendant; here, appellant does not allege the funds were seized from those already paid to counsel of his choice. As appellant\u2019s underlying claim is meritless, trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective, and remand for further development of the claim pertaining to appellate counsel is unwarranted. McGill, at 1025.\nWhether trial counsel failed to conduct a professionally responsible investigation, failed to impeach Commonwealth witnesses, improperly stipulated to key pieces of Commonwealth evidence, pursued an implausible defense theory, and failed to test the Commonwealth\u2019s case.\nIn evaluating the series of claims in this issue, we are mindful that attorney performance is to be assessed without the distortion of hindsight; rather, we must reconstruct the circumstances under which counsel\u2019s decisions were made and evaluate counsel\u2019s conduct from his perspective at that time. See Strickland, at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052\nAppellant first claims trial counsel should have investigated and presented evidence of his drug abuse and mental health issues at the guilt phase; he points to statements of arresting officers concerning his intoxicated state, statements of friends, family, and former counsel regarding his longstanding drug addiction, and reports of defense mental health experts who testified at the PCRA hearing that he suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and drug-induced psychosis at the time of the offense. He contends, based on the above evidence, trial counsel should have presented a diminished capacity defense, and trial counsel\u2019s presentation of a misidentification defense was unreasonable. However, appellant never admitted to killing the victims, a prerequisite for claiming diminished capacity. As appellant maintained, even at the PCRA proceedings, that he did not commit the murders, see N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/7/99, at 75, the defense of diminished capacity was not available, and trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise it. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 572 Pa. 283, 815 A.2d 563, 578-79 (2002) (counsel not ineffective for failing to pursue diminished capacity defense where defendant denied killing victim).\nAppellant contends trial counsel failed to conduct an adequate investigation of impeachment evidence of key Commonwealth witnesses. Specifically, he claims Greg Johnson, who identified appellant at trial as the shooter, told Ruben Brezeal and Gregory Moton he had not seen the shooter. See Affidavit/Declaration of Ruben Brezeal, 1/13/97, at \u00b6 3; Affidavit/Declaration of Gregory Moton, 1/19/97, at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7. Appellant claims Johnson told John Craig Haynes that he named appellant as the shooter because police were threatening to charge him with drug trafficking if he did not implicate appellant. See Affidavit/Declaration of John Craig Haynes, 3/27/97, at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. Appellant claims Kim Glenn, Moton, and Brezeal all knew Johnson was capable of \u201cdoing some pretty sleazy things ... pretty much anything^]\u201d and would do whatever he had to do to save himself. Affidavit/Deelaration of Kim Glenn, 1/10/97, at \u00b6 15; see also Affidavit Declaration of Gregory Moton, 1/19/97, at \u00b6 4; Affidavit/Deelaration of Ruben Brezeal, 1/13/97, at \u00b6 6. Appellant also claims Brezeal could have impeached Yianna Pannell, who identified appellant as her rapist; Brezeal would have stated Pannell was confused about who raped her and could not recall the event clearly. See Affidavit/Deelaration of Ruben Brezeal, 1/13/97, at \u00b6 3.\nTo be entitled to relief on a claim of ineffectiveness for failure to call a witness, appellant must demonstrate: the witness existed, was available, and willing to cooperate; counsel knew or should have known of the witness; and the absence of the witness\u2019s testimony prejudiced appellant. Commonwealth v. Fletcher, 561 Pa. 266, 750 A.2d 261, 275 (2000), overruled on other grounds. Trial counsel vigorously cross-examined Johnson and Pannell at trial, questioning the veracity of their identifications and suggesting motives for them to testify falsely; he painted the picture of a rivalry between appellant\u2019s drug ring and another the victims were involved with, describing an assault by appellant on members of the victims\u2019 organization just days before the shooting, thus supplying the victims with a motive to falsely implicate appellant as the shooter. Counsel argued none of the witnesses who identified appellant did so immediately, but rather only at other witnesses\u2019 urgings once they were told of appellant\u2019s prior assault. As the PCRA court found, appellant fails to demonstrate the testimony of the witnesses he now offers would have contributed anything \u201cmore than hearsay, conjecture and unsubstantiated rumors.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 3/25/04, at 24. Furthermore, trial counsel testified he was aware of Brezeal, but declined to use him as a witness because he did not find him credible; Brezeal told counsel he would not testify unless he was paid. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/13/99, at 154. Therefore, we cannot say the absence of these witnesses\u2019 testimony prejudiced appellant.\nAppellant claims trial counsel was ineffective for proceeding with a misidentification defense when there was evidence pointing to the JBM, a drug organization which dominated the neighborhood where the shooting occurred, as being responsible for the shooting. Appellant points to statements from Kinard and Moton, who stated Haynes was a drug dealer and rival of the JBM, and opined the shooting was an attempt to get back at Haynes, who lived several doors down from the crime scene. See Affidavit/Declaration of Andre Kinard, 1/15/97, at \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 7; Affidavit/Declaration of Gregory Moton, 1/19/97, at \u00b6\u00b6 5-7. Appellant also cites an FBI agent\u2019s statement that \u201c[appellant] stated [the] reason why he left Philadelphia [was] that he heard Black Mafia was out to kill him. He didn\u2019t know where [the] rumor came from[,] and didn\u2019t have any names[,] or the reasons why[.]\u201d Investigation Interview Record of Special Agent Ronald G. Risner, 11/21/88, at 3. Finally, appellant cites numerous newspaper articles detailing the drug war between the JBM and its rivals. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 81-82. He claims trial counsel should have been aware of the JBM\u2019s connection with the shootings and pursued this version of defense instead of arguing two Jamaicans were responsible for the shooting.\nCounsel testified that after receiving little cooperation from people in the crime scene\u2019s neighborhood, he discovered information, corroborated by two police reports, placing two Jamaicans at the scene near the time of the shooting. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/8/99, at 24; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/14/99, at 4-5. Appellant never said anything about the JBM being involved, and the evidence concerning the Jamaicans was \u201cthe only evidence [counsel] had that there was somebody else that did this, and [appellant] continually said he didn\u2019t.\u201d Id., at 5. Counsel opted to present the testimony of the taxi driver who dropped the Jamaicans off at the scene shortly before the shooting and that of a victim who gave a description of one of the perpetrators which matched that given by the taxi driver. Aside from the conjecture of Kinard\u2019s and Moton\u2019s statements, there is nothing directly linking the JBM to the shooting, and we cannot say trial counsel chose an unreasonable defense, given the dearth of witness cooperation he received.\nAppellant claims trial counsel should not have stipulated to a police crime lab report which stated a jacket recovered from the vehicle he fled from contained human blood; he contends this stipulation undermined the misidentification defense by essentially conceding his presence at the crime scene. However, appellant overlooks the fact the police report containing the description of the jacket was admissible evidence, which would have been presented through a police department chemist\u2019s recitation of its facts. Trial counsel testified he stipulated to this evidence to avoid having the fact-finder hear such a gory recitation. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/14/99, at 3^4. Trial counsel did not actually stipulate to appellant\u2019s presence at the scene; he merely agreed to the facts contained in the police report, which would have been admitted in a manner far more prejudicial to the defense had he not done so. Additionally, as the PCRA court noted, even if the report arguably placed appellant at the crime scene, it merely corroborated the overwhelming eyewitness testimony and was not the only proof of his culpability. See PCRA Court Opinion, 3/25/04, at 20. Accordingly, we cannot say such decision was without reasonable basis or that appellant was prejudiced by it.\nAppellant claims trial counsel should not have stipulated to the results of a rape kit showing semen was found in Pannell\u2019s vagina and anus; no testable blood groups were found in the semen recovered from Pannell, so the Commonwealth never had the samples it collected from appellant analyzed to determine if they matched the rape kit sample. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/8/99, at 46. Appellant contends, in light of the tests\u2019 inconclusiveness, trial counsel should have argued appellant did not commit the rape. He further contends his brother, Michael, admitted to having sex with Pannell that evening, and that other evidence pointed to Michael as the perpetrator. He argues trial counsel should have more vigorously pursued the theory that Michael, not appellant, committed the rape.\nTrial counsel testified that, rather than challenge the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to have appellant\u2019s samples analyzed and have the results come back as \u201canother nail in the coffin[,]\u201d id., at 54, 56, he chose to stipulate to the rape kit\u2019s inconclusive results. All these results showed was that someone had sex with the victim; there was nothing linking appellant to the rape. Furthermore, trial counsel called Michael Birdsong to testify, purportedly, that he was the one who committed the crimes; when Michael invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and did not testify, appellant argued on direct appeal that he should have been granted a continuance to present Michael\u2019s testimony. We held, \u201c[E]ven if Michael testified that it was he, not [ajppellant, that committed the crimes, this testimony would have been of little value in light of the testimony of the many eyewitnesses who knew [ajppellant and identified him as the shooter.\u201d Birdsong, at 35. Likewise, any challenge trial counsel could have raised regarding the rape kit or Michael\u2019s culpability would have paled in the face of the other evidence linking appellant to the crimes. Therefore, we cannot conclude trial counsel\u2019s performance was unreasonable or prejudicial to appellant.\nAs appellant\u2019s claims of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness fail, there is no need to remand for development of the claims concerning appellate counsel. McGill, at 1025.\nWhether appellant\u2019s joint trial with his brother was improper because of antagonistic defenses.\nAppellant claims his brother\u2019s defense portrayed appellant as the exclusive driving force behind the crimes, and was so antagonistic to his defense that the two were irreconcilable and mutually exclusive; he argues this portrayal precluded him from presenting evidence in support of the \u00a7 9711(e)(7) mitigator (defendant\u2019s participation in homicidal act was relatively minor). He further contends his brother\u2019s questioning of Commonwealth witnesses emphasized their identification of appellant and the evidence of his other crimes, and asserts he was tainted by evidence the Commonwealth presented concerning his brother\u2019s tampering with a witness. Thus, appellant argues, trial counsel should have moved for severance.\nThe decision to sever co-defendants\u2019 trials lies within the trial court\u2019s discretion, and will not be disturbed absent an abuse thereof. Commonwealth v. King, 554 Pa. 331, 721 A.2d 763, 771 (1998). Joint trials are favored when judicial economy will be served by avoiding the expensive and time-consuming duplication of evidence, and where the defendants are charged with conspiracy. Commonwealth v. Jones, 542 Pa. 464, 668 A.2d 491, 501 (1995).\n\u201c[T]he mere fact that there is hostility between defendants, or that one may try to save himself at the expense of another, is in itself not sufficient grounds to require separate trials. In fact, it has been asserted that the fact that defendants have conflicting versions of what took place, or the extents to which they participated in it, is a reason for rather than against a joint trial because the truth may be more easily determined if all are tried together.\u201d\nKing, at 771 (quoting Commonwealth v. Chester, 526 Pa. 578, 587 A.2d 1367, 1373 (1991)) (emphasis added). A defendant claiming there is possibility of conflicting or antagonistic defenses \u201cmust show a real potential for prejudice and not just mere speculation.\u201d Jones, at 501, 668 A.2d 491.\nAppellant fails to demonstrate he was prejudiced by being tried jointly with his brother. Each co-defendant attempted to minimize his own role in the crime and make the other appear to be the instigator; this is a common strategy which is a reason for, not against, a joint trial. King, at 771. As the PCRA court noted, appellant fails to establish how the outcome of his trial would have differed had he been tried separately, \u201cwhen the undisputed evidence, including numerous eye-witnesses, placed [him] at the scene of the crime as the shooter and the rapist.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 3/25/04, at 19-20. Thus, appellant\u2019s underlying severance claim lacks merit, he cannot prevail on his claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, and remand is unnecessary for further development of this claim as it pertains to appellate counsel. McGill, at 1025.\nPenalty Phase\nWhether appellant\u2019s waiver of a sentencing jury was invalid.\nAppellant claims he did not receive a proper colloquy informing him he could waive a jury at trial but still have one at sentencing, and he was not informed of potential aggravating and mitigating factors, the burden of proof regarding these factors, or the requirement that a jury\u2019s death verdict be unanimous. Appellant acknowledges his participation in a waiver colloquy prior to the guilt phase, but contends he should have received a separate colloquy prior to the penalty phase to determine if he still wanted to waive a jury at sentencing; he claims the prosecutor mislead him into believing if he waived a jury at the guilt phase, then he had to waive it at the sentencing phase as well.\n\u201cUnder Pennsylvania law, a capital defendant tried without a jury in the guilt phase retains the right to a jury in the penalty phase ... unless he specifically waives that right without objection by the Commonwealth.\u201d Commonwealth v. Fears, 575 Pa. 281, 836 A.2d 52, 70 (2003) (citing 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(b)). While this Court has not provided a mechanical listing of what must be included in a colloquy regarding waiver of a penalty phase jury, we have made clear:\n[T]he colloquy must be an on-record dialogue, ... calculated to insure the defendant comprehends the nature and significance of the right being waived. At the very least, ... the defendant should be asked if he understands that he has the right to be sentenced by a penalty-phase jury, whether any waiver to that right has been based on promises or coercion and if he understands that under Pennsylvania law a penalty-phase jury must render a unanimous verdict.\nId. (citing Commonwealth v. O\u2019Donnell, 559 Pa. 320, 740 A.2d 198, 213 (1999)) (citations omitted).\nIn Commonwealth v. Mallory, 596 Pa. 172, 941 A.2d 686 (2008), we addressed the issue of ineffectiveness in connection with the validity of a defendant\u2019s jury waiver. Although Mallory was not decided at the time the parties in the instant matter filed their briefs, it is instructive. In that case, the defendants executed extensive written jury waiver colloquies but did not request on-the-record oral colloquies, and the trial court did not conduct such colloquies. After their direct appeals were unsuccessful, the defendants filed PCRA petitions, each alleging his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to challenge the validity of his jury waiver on the grounds the trial court did not conduct an oral colloquy pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 620. The PCRA court held the absence of such colloquies rendered the waivers invalid as a matter of law and concluded counsel were ineffective. The Superior Court reversed, finding the defendants failed to demonstrate prejudice as discussed in Commonwealth v. Lassiter, 554 Pa. 586, 722 A.2d 657 (1998) (Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court) (defendants challenging validity of jury waiver must demonstrate outcome of joint trial would have been more favorable if conducted before jury). We accepted review to address the proper analysis of the prejudice prong of the ineffectiveness test in the context of the validity of a jury waiver, as Lassiter did not definitively resolve the issue.\nIn addressing whether the lack of an oral jury waiver colloquy, as contemplated by Pa.R.Crim.P. 620, warranted a presumption of prejudice, we made the following observations:\nThe essential elements of a jury waiver, though important and necessary to an appreciation of the right, are nevertheless simple to state and easy to understand. \u201cThe[ ] essential ingredients, basic to the concept of a jury trial, are the requirements that the jury be chosen from members of the community (a jury of one\u2019s peers), that the verdict be unanimous, and that the accused be allowed to participate in the selection of the jury panel.\u201d Commonwealth v. Williams, 454 Pa. 368, 312 A.2d 597, 600 (1973); accord Commonwealth v. Smith, 498 Pa. 661, 450 A.2d 973, 974 (1982).\n* *\nA waiver colloquy is a procedural device; it is not a constitutional end or a constitutional \u201cright.\u201d Citizens can waive their fundamental rights in the absence of a colloquy; indeed, waivers can occur by conduct or by implication.... Moreover, the absence of an on-the-record colloquy concerning the fundamentals of a trial by jury does not prove, in an absolute sense, that a defendant failed to understand the right he waived by proceeding non-jury. Consider, for example, a criminally-accused lawyer who waives a jury. Or, consider a career criminal defendant with previous, first-hand experience with jury trials. Or, imagine a reasonably intelligent client whose lawyer informed him, off the record, of the three basics of a jury trial. The record colloquy contemplated by Pa.R.Crim.P. 620 serves a salutary prophylactic purpose, as it makes it plain that a jury waiver is knowing and voluntary, and it creates a record in the event of a later, collateral attack upon the waiver. For the same twin reasons, an on-the-record colloquy is a useful procedural tool whenever the waiver of any significant right is at issue, constitutional or otherwise, e.g., waiver of a trial, waiver of the right to counsel, waiver of the right to call witnesses, waiver of the right to cross-examine witnesses, waiver of rules-based speedy trial time limits, etc. But the colloquy does not share the same status as the right itself.\nThe right to a jury trial in criminal cases, unlike the Rule-based requirement of a waiver colloquy, does implicate constitutional concerns. If this case involved direct governmental denial of an explicit request for a jury \u2014 if appellants had demanded a jury and the trial judge said, \u201cNo\u201d\u2014 appellants would have a valid claim that they were denied their constitutional right to trial by jury. But that is not the claim presented here. Appellants explicitly waived their rights to a jury, in writing, on the record. Appellants\u2019 shared collateral claim (the Lewises have an added burden concerning appellate counsel which we will address below) is that, notwithstanding their explicit written waiver colloquies, which were attested by their lawyers, the prosecutor and (in two of three cases) the trial judge, those waivers were the product of the ineffectiveness of their trial counsel. Specifically, they allege that their lawyers failed to object when the trial court failed to conduct an on-the-record oral waiver colloquy to supplement the written waivers. If they had been so queried in open court, all three appellants claim, they would have contradicted their written waivers and demanded a jury. This not uncommon my-record-waiver-was-my-lawyer\u2019s-fault claim is far removed from the \u201cconstitutional, structural\u201d error that would be at issue if a timely jury demand was wrongly denied.\nMallory, at 696-97.\nWe also stressed the importance of recognizing the distinct analysis required when a jury waiver colloquy claim is litigated through the guise of counsel ineffectiveness:\nRecognizing that the claim here involves a collateral attack focusing upon the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and that the collateral attack only indirectly implicates the distinct constitutional right to a jury trial and the Rule-based \u201cright\u201d to an oral waiver colloquy, is paramount to its proper evaluation. Of course, lawyers have an obligation to counsel their clients in conjunction with the waiver of basic rights, including the waiver of a jury; but the mere absence of a record oral waiver colloquy does not automatically prove that a right was relinquished unknowingly or involuntarily and that the trial lawyer was ineffective for causing the waiver. When a presumptively-valid waiver is collaterally attacked under the guise of ineffectiveness of counsel, it must be analyzed like any other ineffectiveness claim. Such an inquiry is not resolved by the mere absence of an oral waiver colloquy; instead, the analysis must focus on the totality of relevant circumstances. Those circumstances include the defendant\u2019s knowledge of and experience with jury trials, his explicit written waiver (if any), and the content of relevant off-the-record discussions counsel had with his client. See Commonwealth v. Allen, 557 Pa. 135, 732 A.2d 582, 590 (1999) (rejecting per se approach and holding that trial court should determine defendant\u2019s actual knowledge in guilty plea colloquy context by looking at totality of circumstances to distinguish whether plea was voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently made); Commonwealth v. DeGeorge, 506 Pa. 445, 485 A.2d 1089, 1091-92 (1984) (permitting \u201cconsideration of circumstances outside the content of the of-record colloquy in determining the validity of the waiver\u201d when counsel allegedly was ineffective for failing to object to trial court\u2019s acceptance of defendant\u2019s jury waiver without first conducting on-the-record colloquy); see also Commonwealth v. O\u2019Donnell, 559 Pa. 320, 740 A.2d 198, 215-19 (1999) (Castille, J., dissenting) (collecting and discussing cases).\nId., at 698. We then confirmed the propriety of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d approach:\n[Ajbsence of an oral colloquy alone does not prove that a jury waiver was in fact unknowing or involuntary; rather, the PCRA court must look to the totality of the circumstances ... including the discussions between the lawyers and their clients regarding the jury waiver.... The analysis regarding the underlying merits of appellants\u2019 ineffectiveness challenge must be more precise and must account for all relevant circumstances surrounding the waiver.\nId., at 704. Finally, we rejected the argument that collateral jury waiver allegations were among the circumstances in which prejudice may be presumed:\n[T]o prove trial counsel ineffective, each appellant must show that his understanding of the [jury] waiver was constitutionally impaired by his lawyer\u2019s deficient performance, as well as proof that he would have elected a jury but for his lawyer\u2019s performance. Thus, we affirm the Lassiter OAJC to the extent it determined that, in circumstances like these, actual prejudice must be shown.\nId., at 702.\nHere, unlike Mallory, there was an on-the-record oral colloquy; however, Mallows summary of the burden of proof for a defendant who alleges counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in connection with a jury waiver is controlling. Appellant must demonstrate he did not understand what he was waiving; that trial counsel caused his failure to understand; and that, but for counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, he would have insisted upon a jury. He does not even attempt to address this requirement; furthermore, a review of the colloquy under the totality of the circumstances reveals appellant cannot prevail on his claim.\nThe trial court specifically told appellant: \u201cAt [the penalty] hearing, if it is just with a judge, you could have a jury hearing if you decided to go with a jury.\u201d N.T. Trial, 10/18/89, at 30. The prosecutor then commented: \u201cYou could have a jury who heard the trial of first degree murder also make a decision on the penalties.... Having a trial with the judge here, the judge will make that determination.... \u201d Id. This comment could be interpreted to mean that if appellant waived a jury at the guilt phase, he automatically did so at the penalty phase, too. The prosecutor later stated, however:\nKnowing that that is a possibility, do you still wish to have this judge, and I am only talking about the death penalty phase here, that particular phase if we get to that?\nSo you are giving up your right [to a jury] as to whether you did it and you are also giving up your right to a jury trial on the decision as to what penalty to impose....\nId., at 31 (emphasis added).\nThese comments could be interpreted as referring to appellant\u2019s waiver of a penalty phase jury as being separate from his waiver of one at the guilt phase; as the dissent notes, the colloquy did include some potentially confusing points.\nRead in its entirety, however, the record reflects appellant was informed of the essential requirements under O\u2019Donnell; appellant participated in the colloquy, asked questions and conferred with counsel, and indicated he understood the right he was waiving and that his waiver had not been coerced. See id., at 28-36. Specifically, appellant assented when the prosecutor stated, \u201cJust so you know ... you can\u2019t say later I wanted a jury on the death penalty[,]\u201d and \u201cYou are giving up your right today to have a jury ... make up their mind as to what proper penalty under the law is____The judge and the judge alone will make that determination.\u201d Id., at 33-34. Appellant assented when asked: \u201c[D]o you still wish to have the judge hear this on her own without the jury?\u201d and \u201cYou talked with your lawyer and said you understood what I said and want the judge to decide that aspect of it, death penalty phase without a jury.\u201d Id., at 34-35. Appellant also assented when the prosecutor explained that if 11 jurors decided appellant should receive the death penalty, \u201cbut one of them decided that life imprisonment was proper, you wouldn\u2019t get the death penalty.\u201d Id., at 35. Appellant assented again when the prosecutor asked, \u201cKnowing that is the right you are giving up for purposes of the death penalty, do you wish for the Court to make that decision and not 12 individual people?\u201d Id., at 36.\nAppellant and his brother, who was colloquial with him, expressed their decision to waive a jury was motivated by their belief the media tainted the public against them. See Id., at 37-38. Furthermore, trial counsel recalled that prior to trial, he and the prosecutor met with the trial judge, who \u201cwanted to know if this could be worked out\u201d with \u201ca life plea or anything else like that,\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/8/99, at 22, but the prosecutor refused to accept anything but a plea to death. Trial counsel\u2019s recollection was that the trial judge \u201cwas absolutely, unconditionally appalled\u201d at the Commonwealth\u2019s intransigence, and all members of the defense (both the defendants and their attorneys) agreed, after conferring together, that \u201cour best shot for not getting death in this case was going to be with [the trial judge].\u201d Id., at 22-23.\nTrial counsel added he recalled fully explaining the concept of jury waiver to appellant, that he believed waiver of a jury at both phases of the trial was in appellant\u2019s best interests, and that all key members of the defense (himself, appellant, appellant\u2019s brother, and his brother\u2019s counsel) agreed on this point. Trial counsel testified appellant \u201cdidn\u2019t want a jury in the penalty phase. The penalty phase was exactly what we were scared of. We thought the district attorney\u2019s office was so outrageous and [the trial judge] was so upset by what the district attorney\u2019s office was doing [in refusing to accept a plea to life imprisonment] that this was his best shot for life.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/18/99, at 149-50. Trial counsel testified that to the best of his knowledge and recollection, he had explained to appellant that the jury waiver would mean the trial judge alone would make the decision at the penalty phase. Id., at 177. When asked if he agreed with appellant on the question of jury waiver, trial counsel replied, \u201cYes. We had long discussions about it.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/14/99, at 6-7.\nCrucially, at no time during the PCRA hearings, which ultimately stretched over several months, did appellant testify to contradict or challenge trial counsel\u2019s testimony, or even to claim he did not understand what was he was waiving. Instead, PCRA counsel premised the claim upon the waiver colloquy alone. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 12/5/00, at 7-22. The record and uncontradicted testimony, however, reveal the jury waiver was motivated precisely by a fully-informed desire that the trial judge preside over the penalty phase. The strategy, as so identified, obviously was reasonable.\nAppellant has not demonstrated, beyond a bald allegation of prejudice, that trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness caused him to waive a jury at the penalty phase. See Harrington v. Richter, \u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 770, 790-92, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011) (if all that can be shown is \u201cmerely that the defense strategy did not work out as well as counsel had hoped,\u201d ineffectiveness claim should not be granted). Appellant\u2019s brief merely states, \u25a0without support in case law or the record, he suffered prejudice because of allegedly erroneous and confusing statements made during the colloquy. He does not point to any deficient performance on the part of trial counsel, and, as there was a reasonable basis for trial counsel\u2019s strategy, the claim regarding appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness is meritless, and there is no need to remand for further development. McGill, at 1025.\nWhether appellant\u2019s waiver of mental health testimony was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary.\nTrial counsel planned to call Dr. Allan Tepper, a psychologist who evaluated appellant the night before the penalty phase, to present mitigating mental health testimony. However, immediately after Dr. Tepper arrived in court, appellant informed counsel he did not wish to have this expert testify. N.T. Penalty Phase, 10/27/89, at 669. The trial court colloquied appellant to establish the voluntariness of his decision to forego Dr. Tepper\u2019s testimony, and was satisfied such decision was knowing and informed. Id., at 669-70. Appellant claims his waiver of Dr. Tepper\u2019s mental health testimony was not valid because trial counsel did not retain this expert until the eve of the penalty phase, did not provide adequate background information about appellant to this expert, and did not explain to appellant the substance of this expert testimony and its value as mitigating evidence. Appellant contends although appellate counsel argued on direct appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in permitting this waiver, appellate counsel failed to proffer facts showing why the waiver was invalid, i.e., trial counsel\u2019s inadequate preparation.\nOn direct appeal, this Court concluded the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to reopen the penalty phase so that Dr. Tepper could testify, as appellant\u2019s waiver was voluntary, and he failed to present any information regarding the nature of the proposed testimony or the mitigating circumstances to which it would have been relevant. See Birdsong, at 33-34. Appellant essentially contends his failure to present the information necessary to prevail on this claim was the result of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in preparing the expert and in conveying to appellant the import of this witness\u2019s testimony. However, trial counsel testified he stressed the importance of Dr. Tepper\u2019s testimony to appellant, telling him without this expert\u2019s testimony, he would probably get the death penalty; trial counsel stated he \u201cabsolutely, unconditionally, tried to get him to let Dr. Tepper testify.\u201d N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/13/99, at 128; see also id., at 126-35. The only reason appellant gave counsel for not wanting Dr. Tepper to testify was he was afraid Dr. Tepper would make him \u201clook dumb.\u201d Id., at 123. Despite trial counsel\u2019s strenuous attempts to convince appellant otherwise, he failed to do so; appellant\u2019s refusal to heed counsel\u2019s advice does not make counsel ineffective. Thus, the underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness fails, and remand for further development of this claim with respect to appellate counsel\u2019s stewardship is unnecessary. McGill, at 1025.\nWhether trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate, prepare, and present mitigating evidence in support of a diminished capacity defense at trial and as mitigation at the penalty phase.\nAppellant claims trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present evidence regarding his drug addiction, traumatic and abusive childhood, and mental health issues such as PTSD and drug-induced psychosis. Appellant asserts the evidence of his mental health issues and drug abuse would have supported a diminished capacity defense in the guilt phase; he further asserts he would not have waived a jury at the guilt phase had he known a diminished capacity defense was available. Finally, he contends the evidence of his addiction, dysfunctional childhood, intellectual deficiencies, and mental illness should have been presented in the penalty phase in support of the \u00a7 9711(e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(8) mitigators.\nAt the penalty phase, trial counsel presented the testimony of Aisha Johnson, the mother of appellant\u2019s two-year-old son, and Altrecia Berry, Johnson\u2019s mother. Berry testified appellant was a good person and a good father; she had never known him to be violent. N.T. Penalty Phase, 10/27/89, at 660. Johnson testified appellant was a good father, but that he had a drug problem; when he was not high, he was nice and gentle, but when he was high, he became violent and nasty. Id., at 663-66. Trial counsel planned to call Dr. Tepper, but as previously noted, appellant indicated he did not want this expert to testify. Id., at 669. Trial counsel pled for appellant\u2019s life in his closing statement, emphasizing appellant\u2019s drug use in support of the \u00a7 9711(e)(3) mitigator, and pointing out appellant had been offered no choice other than to enter a guilty plea to a death sentence. Id., at 676. Trial counsel also contrasted other capital cases where the defendants had received life sentences, and argued vehemently for a life sentence. Id., at 677-79.\nAt the PCRA hearing, appellant presented the testimony of experts, friends, and family, who he asserted should have been called at the penalty phase, as well as that of trial and appellate counsel. Specifically, appellant\u2019s mother, brothers, and sister testified about appellant\u2019s dysfunctional family history, which included a traumatic fire he witnessed at a young age, physical and verbal abuse by their alcoholic father, poverty, and involvement with gangs and drugs by appellant and his brothers. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/5/00, at 149-79, 205; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/6/00, at 54-79, 178, 186-87, 190-91. Appellant\u2019s childhood friend testified to these same facts, and specifically mentioned appellant suffered from hallucinations and suffered a head injury in a gang fight, after which his personality changed. Id., at 206-08, 211-15, 216-18. A former girlfriend of appellant\u2019s, who was also the mother of one of his children, testified appellant was sweet when she first knew him, but had changed; however, he was very supportive of their daughter. Id., at 108-10. She stated appellant appeared to be high when she saw him shortly after the murder, and she confirmed his dysfunctional upbringing and the fire he witnessed as a child. Id., at 113, 117-18, 121-22. Appellant\u2019s niece testified to his good character, stating he was like a father to her. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/5/00, at 140-43. All of these witnesses, except appellant\u2019s mother, stated they would have testified at the penalty phase, but they were not contacted. Id., at 144-45; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/6/00, at 81-82, 124, 194, 222. However, the testimony of these witnesses also revealed family communication concerning appellant\u2019s incarceration and upcoming trial was not always ongoing, as family members were living in different states, one brother was incarcerated, and appellant had distanced himself from them. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/5/00, at 184-91, 209; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/6/00, at 100-01,196-97.\nAppellant\u2019s former girlfriend, Aisha Johnson, one of the two witnesses called at the penalty phase, testified the only phone contact she had with counsel prior to the penalty phase concerned a matter pertaining to appellant\u2019s property. She stated counsel\u2019s investigators never met with or called her, but admitted these events were over ten years ago, and she did not recall whether she was contacted. Id., at 149-50, 167-68. According to Johnson, counsel did not speak to her about her penalty phase testimony until right before it began, and he only spoke with her for five minutes, not asking her anything about appellant\u2019s upbringing or his change of behavior when he was on drugs. Id., at 148-49, 151, 153, 162. She said appellant was different when he was on drugs. Id., at 169.\nTrial counsel testified he had been practicing law for nine years when he was appointed to represent appellant, and he did everything he could possibly do to defend appellant. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/8/99, at 39; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/13/99, at 36. He worked with two investigators to gather information in support of appellant\u2019s defense; they were in touch with him several times a day, apprising him of their progress. Id., at 34-36. Although the investigators spoke to appellant or Aisha Johnson daily by phone, seeking names of potential penalty phase witnesses, many of these potential witnesses refused to help. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/8/99, at 26. Counsel stated appellant\u2019s mother was contacted, but refused to come to appellant\u2019s trial, even when counsel spoke with her on the phone. Id., at 28; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/13/99, at 41-42. Counsel could not recall if he contacted appellant\u2019s father, but thought his investigators had. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/8/99, at 24; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/13/99, at 43. Counsel did not know if the investigators spoke with appellant\u2019s siblings. Id., at 46-48. Counsel could not recall with certainty if he obtained appellant\u2019s school and correctional records, but thought Dr. Tepper had reviewed them. Id., at 51, 111, 113,116.\nRegarding appellant\u2019s drug abuse, counsel thought Aisha Johnson, the mother of appellant\u2019s son, was the best witness to testify about appellant\u2019s personality changes when he was under the influence of drugs. Id., at 87. Counsel repeatedly stated he did not believe appellant\u2019s drug use was at issue, and he did not present additional evidence regarding this because there was no dispute appellant had a severe drug problem and was under the influence of drugs most of the time; the Commonwealth did not contest this evidence. Id., at 65-66, 69, 79-80, 83, 90, 104; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/14/99, at 9. Additionally, Dr. Tepper would have testified about appellant\u2019s drug use. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/13/99, at 66-67.\nCounsel further testified he chose Dr. Tepper as the key witness for the penalty phase because he had a long-standing relationship with this expert and believed him to be the best witness; the Commonwealth would not cross-examine him extensively, as it used him to train prosecutors for capital cases, and Dr. Tepper was not only a psychologist but also an attorney, and thus aware of the issues, case law, and death penalty statute\u2019s requirements in relation to his testimony. Id., at 118-19. In addition to testifying about appellant\u2019s history of drug abuse, Dr. Tepper would have testified appellant had a low IQ. Id., at 122. Counsel testified Dr. Tepper was present and ready to testify at the penalty phase, and appellant knew the importance of this testimony; counsel explained to appellant that without it, he would most likely get the death penalty. Id., at 62, 126, 128, 184; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/14/99, at 45-46. However, appellant suddenly objected, telling counsel he did not want Dr. Tepper\u2019s testimony presented because it would make him appear stupid. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/13/99, at 123, 126-28. Counsel \u201cabsolutely, unconditionally, tried to get him to let Dr. Tepper testify[,]\u201d id., at 128, but could not persuade appellant to change his mind. Finally, counsel testified that throughout his representation of appellant, he had no problem talking to appellant, and they had no problem understanding each other when discussing whether to waive a jury. Id., at 144, 146.\nOne of the investigators who worked with trial counsel confirmed appellant\u2019s mother was contacted but refused to come for trial, the majority of people contacted to be character witnesses for the penalty phase did not want to get involved, she spoke to appellant daily and they never had problems understanding each other, and appellant was very active in the . preparation of his defense and understood what was at stake. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/4/00, at 21-22, 85-88.\nOne of appellant\u2019s PCRA counsel testified that in conducting her investigation for the PCRA proceedings, she was told by appellant\u2019s family that the defense investigators never contacted them; the investigator she spoke with said they had not contacted the family, as trial counsel would have been the one to do that. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/7/00, at 60-61.\nDr. Michael Scott Maher, a forensic psychiatrist who evaluated appellant for the PCRA hearing, testified he reviewed appellant\u2019s school and prison records, pre-sentence investigations from prior offenses, affidavits from friends and family, police reports, and Dr. Tepper\u2019s notes, and after evaluating appellant, concluded appellant\u2019s PTSD and polysubstance abuse at the time of the offense impaired appellant\u2019s capacity to conduct his behavior according to law, as well as impaired his capacity to understand the nature of his behavior and its wrongfulness. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/4/00, at 100-07.\nDr. James Larsen, a forensic psychologist who evaluated appellant for the PCRA hearing, testified that after he viewed the same materials as Dr. Maher and met with appellant, he concluded appellant was a polysubstance abuser with PTSD and a borderline IQ; he further opined these conditions, combined with drug-induced psychosis at the time of the offense, established the \u00a7 9711(e)(2) and (e)(3) mitigators, as Dr. Maher had concluded. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/5/00, at 49-53.\nDr. Tepper testified he evaluated appellant for three hours. Although he conceded he had limited time to conduct his evaluation with limited background information (he did not remember receiving background documents from counsel), he recalled being familiar with the case\u2019s facts and circumstances. Id., at 7, 10, 12-13, 29-30. He testified he would not have independently requested appellant\u2019s juvenile and prison records. Id., at 13-14. He noted appellant\u2019s low IQ and drug use were apparent, and explained his practice was not to ask for the defendant\u2019s version of the crime if counsel said not to; here, he did not recall counsel instructing him not to, so he probably would have asked appellant, and it was appellant\u2019s wish not to speak about it. Id., at 18, 22-23. He did not diagnose appellant as having PTSD, but acknowledged his awareness of his dysfunctional upbringing. Id., at 26, 28.\nThe Commonwealth presented the testimony of Dr. John Sebastian O\u2019Brien, a forensic psychiatrist who reviewed appellant\u2019s records, the affidavits and reports of Drs. Maher, Larsen, and Tepper, and the affidavits of appellant\u2019s family and friends. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/7/00, at 107-08. Dr. O\u2019Brien was used as a consultant only to opine whether the records provided a basis for the other doctors\u2019 conclusions, and he did not examine appellant. He acknowledged appellant had a borderline IQ and a mixed substance abuse disorder, but noted appellant\u2019s low IQ did not prevent him from being a fully functioning adult who ran different businesses and owned several properties and vehicles. Id., at 112, 115. Dr. O\u2019Brien disagreed with the finding that appellant suffered from PTSD; he opined appellant had PTSD as a child, but this disorder had resolved itself by the time he reached adulthood. Id., at 113\u2014 16. Dr. O\u2019Brien further disagreed with the conclusion appellant suffered from a substance-induced psychotic disorder; he opined the \u201cdifficulties\u201d appellant experienced as a result of his substance abuse were manifestations of voluntary substance intoxication, not psychosis. Id., at 116-18, 129. Finally, Dr. O\u2019Brien concluded appellant would have been able to understand the wrongfulness of his conduct and to conform his conduct to the law\u2019s requirements at the time of the crime, and he had not suffered from an extreme psychological or emotional disturbance, so the \u00a7 9711(e)(2) and (e)(3) mitigators were not established. Id., at 143-45.\nIn arguing trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate and present the mitigating evidence summarized above, appellant relies on Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) and Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003), which held capital counsel is obligated to thoroughly investigate and prepare mental health and other mitigating evidence, Williams, at 396, 120 S.Ct. 1495; counsel cannot meet this obligation by relying on \u201conly rudimentary knowledge of [the defendant\u2019s] history from a narrow set of sources.\u201d Wiggins, at 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527. In Commonwealth v. Williams, 597 Pa. 109, 950 A.2d 294 (2008), this Court noted:\nUnder prevailing constitutional norms as explicated by the United States Supreme Court, capital counsel has an obligation to pursue all reasonable avenues for developing mitigating evidence. Counsel must conduct a thorough pretrial investigation, or make reasonable decisions rendering particular investigations unnecessary. Strategic choices made following a less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgment supports the limitation of the investigation. In undertaking the necessary assessment, courts are to make all reasonable efforts to avoid distorting effects of hindsight. Nevertheless, courts must also avoid \u201cpost hoc rationalization of counsel\u2019s conduct.\u201d\nId., at 303-04 (citations and footnote omitted).\nIn Bobby v. Van Hook, \u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 13, 175 L.Ed.2d 255 (2009), the United States Supreme Court further clarified what Strickland requires regarding the investigation and preparation of penalty phase mitigating evidence:\nThe Sixth Amendment entitles criminal defendants to the \u201c \u2018effective assistance of counsel\u2019 \u201d \u2014 that is, representation that does not fall \u201cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d in light of \u201cprevailing professional norms.\u201d That standard is necessarily a general one.... Restatements of professional standards, we have recognized, can be useful as \u201cguides\u201d to what reasonableness entails, but only to the extent they describe the professional norms prevailing when the representation took place.\nId., at 16 (citations omitted).\nWilliams and Wiggins did not establish a new federal constitutional standard by which to measure counsel\u2019s stewardship in preparing for the penalty phase; they simply applied Strickland\u2019s well-settled ineffectiveness standard to later cases involving the specific question of counsel\u2019s duty to investigate mitigating evidence in a capital case. This standard is a general one, and must be flexible enough to consider the prevailing professional norms at the time of counsel\u2019s performance. See Strickland, at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (\u201cA fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel\u2019s challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time.\u201d).\nViewing trial counsel\u2019s penalty phase investigation under the prevailing professional norms at the time of his stewardship, we cannot conclude appellant was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s performance. See Rollins, at 441 (ineffectiveness claim may be denied by showing petitioner\u2019s evidence fails to meet single one of three prongs for claim). Although the only mitigating evidence actually presented was that appellant had a drug problem but was otherwise a good person, the record supports the PCRA court\u2019s conclusion that appellant\u2019s family \u2014 who would have testified about his dysfunctional, abusive upbringing \u2014 was not willing to appear on behalf of appellant, and trial counsel\u2019s efforts to present expert mental health evidence were thwarted by appellant\u2019s refusal to permit such testimony. Appellant\u2019s family testified they would have been penalty phase witnesses but were not contacted; counsel and his investigator testified effort was made to contact them, but no one wanted to get involved. The PCRA court, as the sole arbiter of credibility, found the latter testimony credible, and we cannot disturb this finding. See Abvr-Jamal, at 99 (credibility issues are within sole domain of trier of fact). Accordingly, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to present testimony by appellant\u2019s family.\nRegarding Dr. Tepper, we have already determined appellant voluntarily chose to forego having this expert testify. Therefore, even if the amount of time for evaluation and background information trial counsel gave Dr. Tepper was not reasonable, appellant cannot demonstrate he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s stewardship. Despite appellant\u2019s claim to the contrary, his decision to preclude Dr. Tepper\u2019s testimony was not motivated by a perception that this expert was ill-prepared or conducted an inadequate assessment; his choice was driven by his desire not to have his low intelligence revealed, see N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/13/99, at 123, a fact which was evident in appellant\u2019s school and correctional records. According to trial counsel, had Dr. Tepper testified, he would have brought to light not only appellant\u2019s limited intelligence, but also his family background and its impact on his development. Although Dr. Tepper did not agree with Drs. Maher and Larsen\u2019s diagnosis of PTSD and substance-induced psychosis, it is doubtful the information in appellant\u2019s school and correctional records would have altered Dr. Tepper\u2019s conclusion. The school records reveal appellant\u2019s severe emotional, disciplinary, and academic problems, but do not indicate any psychological disorders or suggest counseling other than placement in special education. The correctional records reflect low intelligence, immaturity, substance abuse, poor impulse control, and aggressive behavior, but specifically state, \u201cThere are no indications of any psychotic thought processes in this individual. Diagnostically he would appear to be a Personality Disorder, Passive-Aggressive Type.\u201d 1978 Mental Health Evaluation by Marvin Strauss, Ph.D., Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 28; see also 1978 Pre-sentence Investigation by James Donaldson, Defendant\u2019s Exhibit 28. Thus, we cannot say trial counsel\u2019s investigation and preparation of mental health mitigating evidence, even if unreasonable, prejudiced appellant. As appellant\u2019s underlying claim of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness fails, remand for further development of this claim concerning appellate counsel is unwarranted. McGill, at 1025.\nWhether appellant\u2019s prior juvenile adjudications were improperly considered as prior felony convictions under aggravating circumstance 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9).\nAppellant claims trial counsel was ineffective for stipulating to three juvenile adjudications which the Commonwealth used to support the \u00a7 9711(d)(9) aggravator (defendant has significant history of felony convictions involving use or threat of violence to person); he argues the law at the time of his trial did not permit the use of juvenile adjudications in adult criminal proceedings, and the use of these adjudications violated his due process rights and constituted an ex post facto violation.\nAt the time of appellant\u2019s trial, the Juvenile Act provided:\n\u00a7 6354. Effect of adjudication\n(a) General rule. \u2014 An order of disposition or other adjudication in a proceeding under this chapter is not a conviction of crime....\n(b) Effect in subsequent judicial matters. \u2014 The disposition of a child under this chapter may not be used against him in any proceeding in any court other than at a subsequent juvenile hearing, whether before or after reaching majority, except:\n(1) in dispositional proceedings after conviction of a felony for the purposes of a presentence investigation and report; or\n(2) if relevant, where he has put his reputation or character in issue in a civil matter.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6354.\nCommonwealth v. Baker, 531 Pa. 541, 614 A.2d 663 (1992), addressed the issue of whether juvenile adjudications could be introduced to support the \u00a7 9711(d)(9) aggravator under the former version of the Juvenile Act, which was in effect when appellant was tried. This Court held such adjudications were admissible as convictions for purposes of capital sentencing, because such sentencing requires an analysis of the defendant\u2019s entire background, character, and record, id., at 675-76, and we have reiterated this holding. See Commonwealth v. Moore, 594 Pa. 619, 937 A.2d 1062, 1068 (2007); Carson, at 274-75. Thus, appellant\u2019s claim is meritless, and remand for further development of this claim with respect to appellate counsel is unwarranted. McGill, at 1025.\nPCRA Proceedings\nAppellant asserts the PCRA court impeded his right to present material evidence when it refused to issue certificates of materiality to subpoena two out-of-state Commonwealth trial witnesses; he claims these witnesses would have described the Commonwealth\u2019s favorable treatment of its witnesses, thus showing their bias and supporting his Brady claim. However, PCRA counsel admitted these witnesses would not recant their trial testimony against appellant, N.T. PCRA Hearing, 10/26/99, at 32-33, and both witnesses appeared unwilling to cooperate with the defense, id., at 34-35; therefore, the PCRA court concluded their purported testimony that they were given housing and transportation to Maryland \u201cwould not make a substantial difference in the jury\u2019s finding of credibility as to these witnesses.\u201d Id., at 42. Thus, this evidence was not material, as it would not have changed the outcome of the case; we perceive no error in this ruling.\nAppellant claims he was prejudiced by the Commonwealth\u2019s unreasonable delay in responding to his PCRA petition; he asserts two witnesses died and another became unavailable between the time he filed his petition and the PCRA hearing. Appellant asserts his father, who died prior to the hearing, would have testified concerning mitigation evidence of appellant\u2019s dysfunctional childhood that should have been presented at the penalty phase, as well as testified in support of appellant\u2019s claim the trial judge was biased against him and his family. Appellant asserts his brother, Michael, who became disabled prior to the hearing and was thus unavailable, would have testified about mitigating evidence of appellant\u2019s childhood and would have admitted it was he, not appellant, who committed the rape. Appellant asserts the trial judge, who also died prior to the hearing, would have been a relevant witness concerning the bias claim.\nThe testimony of appellant\u2019s father would have been cumulative of other family members\u2019 testimony at the PCRA hearing. Thus, appellant was not prejudiced by the delay he attributes to the Commonwealth, during which time this purported witness died. Appellant\u2019s brother, Michael, was called as a trial witness, but exercised his right against self-incrimination. Birdsong, at 35 (citing N.T. Trial, 10/26/89, at 578-79). As previously noted, this Court concluded on direct appeal that this witness\u2019s testimony would not have been helpful to appellant; many eyewitnesses who knew appellant identified him as the shooter. Id. Thus, this issue concerning appellant\u2019s brother\u2019s purported testimony was previously litigated; as appellant does not couch it in terms of ineffectiveness, no further review is appropriate.\nAppellant\u2019s claim the trial judge\u2019s testimony would have established her bias rings hollow in the face of the trial record; the claim was based on the fact the trial judge presided over juvenile proceedings involving appellant\u2019s siblings years before appellant\u2019s trial. As previously noted, the trial judge was not required to recuse herself on this basis, and the record reflects she gave appropriate consideration to appellant\u2019s recusal motion. Thus, appellant\u2019s claims of prejudice by the Commonwealth\u2019s delay in filing its response to his PCRA petition are baseless.\nFinally, appellant claims the PCRA court displayed bias against him by repeatedly interrupting PCRA counsel, refusing to allow counsel to lodge full objections, accusing counsel of stalling, commenting on the credibility of a witness, commenting about the proceedings, interfering with PCRA counsel\u2019s questioning of witnesses, and permitting expert testimony by unqualified Commonwealth witnesses. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 18-21 (citing N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/5/00, at 62; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/6/00, at 15; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/13/99, at 64; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 10/26/99, at 45; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/7/00, at 16; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/14/00, at 3-6). Appellant claims these instances entitle him to a new hearing before a different judge.\nAppellant overlooks the fact that many of the PCRA court\u2019s comments were made in response to PCRA counsel\u2019s repeated attempts to circumvent court rulings and ask redundant questions. A court\u2019s expression of frustration with counsel\u2019s behavior does not evidence a settled bias which would warrant recusal. See Abu-Jamal, at 89-90. Furthermore, \u201c[ajdverse rulings alone do not ... establish the requisite bias warranting recusal, especially where the rulings are legally proper.\u201d Id., at 90 (citations omitted). Our review of the record reveals no instance where the PCRA court\u2019s frustration impaired its ability to preside impartially; therefore, appellant is not entitled to relief.\nConclusion\nHaving found appellant is not entitled to relief on his claims, we affirm the order of the PCRA court denying his petition for collateral relief.\nOrder affirmed; jurisdiction relinquished. The Prothonotary is directed to transmit the record to the Governor pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711\u00ae.\nJustices BAER, McCAFFERY and ORIE MELVIN join the opinion.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a concurring opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion in which Justice TODD joins.\n. The underlying facts are detailed in this Court\u2019s decision on direct appeal. See Commonwealth v. Birdsong, 538 Pa. 587, 650 A.2d 26, 28-30 (1994).\n. Anthony was convicted of the same crimes, except rape; he received two consecutive life sentences for the murders and an aggregate consecutive sentence of 4216 to 85 years imprisonment for the other offenses. The Superior Court affirmed on direct appeal. Commonwealth v. (Anthony) Birdsong, 408 Pa.Super. 643, 588 A.2d 557 (1990) (per curiam).\n. Appellant presented evidence of two mitigating circumstances: 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(3) (capacity of defendant to appreciate criminality of conduct or conform conduct to requirements of law was substantially impaired) and 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8) (any other evidence of mitigation concerning character and record of defendant and circumstances of offense).\n. The procedural history underlying this collateral appeal is somewhat convoluted. Appellant alleged he never received the order dismissing his PCRA petition and filed several documents April 6, 2001, requesting restoration of his appellate rights and leave to appeal nunc pro tunc. The PCRA court deemed these filings a second PCRA petition, which it dismissed as untimely April 11, 2001. The next day, appellant filed notices of appeal from the February 26, 2001 order dismissing his first petition and the April 11, 2001 order dismissing his second petition. The Commonwealth disputed the timeliness of these appeals; however, this Court denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motions to quash. Thus, we will consider appellant\u2019s claims, which only pertain to the February 26, 2001 dismissal of his first PCRA petition.\n. On January 1, 2007, the AAMR became known as the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.\n. Kinard did not tell anyone his trial testimony was perjured until he was found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/7/00, at 54-56.\n. Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726 (2002) abrogated the rule that claims of trial counsel's ineffectiveness must be raised at the first opportunity where appellant has new counsel, see Commonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 372 A.2d 687 (1977); see also Commonwealth v. Chmiel, 536 Pa. 244, 639 A.2d 9, 12 (1994) (ineffectiveness claim must be raised at earliest stage at which counsel whose stewardship is being challenged no longer represents appellant), and instead held a defendant \"should wait to raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel until collateral review.\u201d Grant, at 738. At the time of appellant's trial, direct appeal, and PCRA proceedings, however, Grant was not decided; therefore, on direct appeal, appellant was required to raise his claims of trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in order to avoid waiver. Having failed to raise them on direct appeal, he was required to layer them by alleging the ineffectiveness of both trial and appellate counsel in his PCRA petition. See Hubbard, at 695 n. 6.\n. An assessment of this prong requires appellant to establish each Pierce prong with respect to trial counsel\u2019s performance. Under this prong, trial counsel\u2019s performance must be addressed in order to determine whether appellate counsel was ineffective for failing to argue trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness. See Rush, at 656.\n. This Court abolished relaxed waiver in capital PCRA appeals in Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 554 Pa. 31, 720 A.2d 693, 700 (1998).\n. The statement by appellant's father, who died prior to the PCRA hearing, alleged that during a prior conversation concerning charges against his other sons, the trial judge commented it was common knowledge that his sons were guilty because they came from a criminal family and were bad kids. See Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 40.\n. Appellant asserts the trial judge suggested he and his brother intimidated witnesses, denied his multiple requests for continuances to obtain witnesses, denied his requests to recall witnesses, and sentenced him to death. See Appellant's Brief, at 42.\n. Appellant's claim concerning trial counsel's ineffectiveness for failing to challenge venue was raised and rejected on direct appeal; thus, it is previously litigated. See Birdsong, at 30-32; PCRA Court Opinion, 3/25/04, at 14-15. His claim of appellate counsel's ineffectiveness for failing to include electronic media coverage in the venue challenge, however, has not been litigated and is properly before us. See Collins, at 573.\n. In conjunction with this claim, appellant contends he would not have waived a jury at the guilt phase if counsel had properly investigated and made available the defense of diminished capacity. Appellant did not raise this issue in his PCRA petition; therefore, it is waived. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (issues not raised in lower court are waived and cannot be raised for first time on appellate review).\n. This evidence is detailed infra, in our discussion of appellant\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present it as mitigating evidence during the penalty phase.\n. The PCRA court concluded this issue was previously litigated because on direct appeal, we held trial counsel\u2019s defense theory was reasonable in connection with his choice to elicit testimony concerning appellant\u2019s prior criminal activity; counsel used this testimony to support his strategy of proving someone else committed the shooting and the identification witnesses had lied. See Birdsong, at 244, 24 A.3d at 344; PCRA Court Opinion, 3/25/04, at 14-15. We held this strategy was reasonable, Birdsong, at 244, 24 A.3d at 344; however, we did not hold so specifically regarding counsel\u2019s decision to pursue this defense over the one appellant now purports was more viable. Accordingly, we will address the merits of appellant\u2019s claim.\n. Again appellant contends had he known about these potential defenses and challenges trial counsel could have advanced, he would not have waived a jury at the guilt phase. For the same reasons expressed in n. 13, supra, we reject this claim.\n. The PCRA court held this issue was previously litigated; however, because appellant has now raised it in the context of appellate counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, the issue is distinct from the one raised on direct appeal and is thus reviewable. See Collins, at 573.\n. There was conflicting testimony concerning whether counsel gave Dr. Tepper appellant's background information prior to the eve of sentencing, cf. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/13/99, at 116 and N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/5/00, at 12-14.\n. As discussed supra, in conjunction with our disposition of appellant's guilt phase issues, appellant's claim that trial counsel should have presented evidence of his drug abuse and mental health issues in the guilt phase is meritless, and remand for development of an ineffectiveness claim pertaining to appellate counsel is thus unnecessary. McGill, at 1025.\n. This claim is addressed supra, n. 13.\n. In a one-sentence argument, appellant contends Dr. O'Brien should not have been permitted to testify because he never met or evaluated appellant; however, it was made clear at the PCRA hearing that Dr. O\u2019Brien was testifying as a consultant to review the findings of Drs. Maher and Larsen, in order to rebut their testimony. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 1/14/00, at 23, 25, 35, 37. His opinion was that, based on his review of appellant's records only, there was no basis for certain conclusions the other experts reached; he gave no opinion on their findings based on their evaluations of appellant. Furthermore, appellant did not raise this issue in his PCRA petition; therefore, it is waived. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a).\n. Trial counsel stipulated to two adjudications for robbery and one for burglary; he also stipulated to a 1987 conviction for robbery when appellant was an adult.\n. Appellant did not raise the ex post facto issue in his PCRA petition; therefore, it is waived. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a). Even if properly preserved, this Court rejected an identical challenge in Commonwealth v. Carson, 590 Pa. 501, 913 A.2d 220, 275-76 (2006).\n. Section 6354 was subsequently amended in 1995 to permit the use of delinquency adjudications in a criminal proceeding where evidence of such offenses would be admissible if they were committed by an adult. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6354(b)(4).\n. Furthermore, any \"error in submitting an aggravating circumstance is harmless where the jury finds multiple aggravators and no mitigators[,]\u201d Carson, at 275 (citing Commonwealth v. Lester, 554 Pa. 644, 722 A.2d 997, 1006 n. 15 (1998)), as was the case here. The trial court found both the \u00a7 9711(d)(9) and (d)(ll) aggravators proven, and no mitigating circumstances; thus, the outcome at sentencing would have been death even absent the \u00a7 9711(d)(9) aggravator. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(c)(l)(iv). Thus, appellant fails to demonstrate he was prejudiced by the inclusion of the \u00a7 9711(d)(9) aggravator.\n. Appellant overlooks the fact the PCRA hearing was continued several times due to the illness of the trial judge who was initially assigned to hear his PCRA claims. See Commonwealth\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, 10/13/00, at 4-5."}
