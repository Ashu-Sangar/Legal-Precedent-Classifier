{"id": "4203166", "contents": "OPINION ANNOUNCING THE JUDGMENT OF THE COURT\nJustice EAKIN.\nIndian Rocks Property Owners Association, Inc. of Ledge-dale originated in 1955 as the governing body of a development located in Salem Township, Wayne County, Pennsylvania. The development consists of 546 acres, and its purpose is \u201c \u2018to develop adjacent lakeside land into a miniature community for vacation, recreation and retirement.\u2019 \u201d Indian Rocks Property Owners Association, Inc. of Ledgedale v. Glatfelter, 950 A.2d 1093, 1095 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008) (quoting Association\u2019s Official Handbook). The Association developed rules and regulations, which are recorded as protective covenants running with the land. Article VIII, \u00a7 1 of the Covenants provides all \u201c \u2018building, excavation, exterior remodeling or altering of any structure, wall or fence shall [not] be commenced without obtaining written approval of the Developer ... as to the location, elevation, set back from property lines, construction materials, quality of workm[a]nship and harmony of external design with existing structures.\u2019 \u201d Id.\nIn 1980, John P. Glatfelter and his wife, Regina L. Glatfelter, purchased a lot within the community; John Glatfelter died in 1990, leaving Regina Glatfelter the sole owner. The lot sat vacant until the fall of 2003 when son David Glatfelter began constructing a foundation. The Association initially inspected and approved the excavation, but in December, 2003 informed the Glatfelters the work was substandard and inadequate pursuant to the Covenants. The Glatfelters were ordered to cease construction until a new construction plan was approved.\nIn April, 2004, the Association filed an equity action alleging the Glatfelters violated the Pennsylvania Construction Code Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.101 et seq., which the Association incorporated into the Covenants by resolution on April 24, 2004. The Association sought an order directing the Glatfelters to comply with the Covenants and to cease work until approval was obtained from the architectural committee. On April 30, 2004, the Glatfelters agreed to stop work until they submitted a new application for construction in conformance with the Covenants, but they failed to comply with the agreement; trial on the equity action was scheduled for July 26, 2005. At trial, the parties entered a stipulation; the Glatfelters agreed to file an application for construction within 60 days, prepare an outline to comply with the Covenants and Construction Code, and hire an engineer to monitor construction. In exchange, the Association waived all past fees and fines. The trial court approved the stipulation and entered it as an order. The Glatfelters again failed to fulfill their obligations pursuant to the stipulation, and the Association filed a petition for civil contempt.\nBetween the commencement of the equity action in April, 2004 and the July, 2005 trial, Act 92 of 2004 amended the Construction Code to exempt \u201crecreational cabins\u201d from its requirements so long as:\n(i) the cabin is equipped with at least one smoke detector, one fire extinguisher and one carbon monoxide detector in both the kitchen and sleeping quarters; [and]\n(ii) the owner of the cabin files with the municipality either\n(A) an affidavit on a form prescribed by the department attesting to the fact that the cabin meets the definition of a \u201crecreational cabin\u201d in section 103; or\n(B) a valid proof of insurance for the recreational cabin, written and issued by an insurer authorized to do business in this Commonwealth, stating that the structure meets the definition of a \u201crecreational cabin\u201d as defined in section 103.\n35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.104(b)(7). A \u201crecreational cabin\u201d is defined as a structure:\n(1) utilized principally for recreational activity;\n(2) not utilized as a domicile or residence for any individual for any time period;\n(3) not utilized for commercial purposes;\n(4) not greater than two stories in height, excluding basement;\n(5) not utilized by the owner or any other person as a place of employment;\n(6) not a mailing address for bills and correspondence; and\n(7) not listed as an individual\u2019s place of residence on a tax return, driver\u2019s license, car registration or voter registration.\nId., \u00a7 7210.103. Despite adopting the Construction Code the prior year, the Association passed a resolution in April, 2005 refusing to recognize the recreational cabin exemption.\nThe Glatfelters relied upon the recreational cabin exemption when they responded to the Association\u2019s petition for contempt and argued they were exempt from the Construction Code and the Covenants. On December 26, 2005, the Glatfelters submitted a building permit issued by Salem Township for construction of a \u201c \u2018two-story vacation home, slab on grade: stick built (recreational cabin exempt).\u2019 \u201d Indian Rocks, at 1097 (quoting Salem Township Permit). Attached to the permit was a \u201cRecreational Cabin Affidavit\u201d in which the Glatfelters stated the proposed structure met the requirements of the Construction Code\u2019s recreational cabin exemption.\nThe trial court heard argument on the Association\u2019s civil contempt petition on April 12, 2006. At that time, the parties stipulated the issue for determination was \u201c \u2018[w]hether or not the provisions of a recreational cabin exclusion [are] applicable in this case and/or whether or not a recreational cabin as defined by the Uniform [Construction] Code creates an exemption which is binding upon the Townships as well as Property Owners Associations.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Stipulation, at \u00b6 23). While the trial court agreed the Glatfelters met the recreational cabin exemption, it held the exemption did not apply because the Glatfelters agreed to comply with the Association\u2019s requirements as they existed at the time of the April 30, 2004 agreement. Regarding contempt, the trial court found the Glatfelters did not willfully violate the court\u2019s order and permitted an additional 90 days to comply. After the Glatfelters failed to do so, the Association filed another contempt petition, which the trial court granted.\nThe Glatfelters timely appealed the contempt order to the Commonwealth Court. The Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order, holding the Glatfelters did not waive their ability to raise the recreational cabin exemption by virtue of the April, 2004 and July, 2005 agreements. Id., at 1100. The court noted the Construction Code unambiguously preempts the field of construction regulation. Therefore, since neither of the agreements specifically referred to the \u201crecreational cabin\u201d exemption, the Glatfelters did not waive the ability to invoke the exemption. The Commonwealth Court did not address whether the purported use satisfied the definition of \u201crecreational activity,\u201d as the only issues before it were \u201cwhether the recreational cabin exclusion applies ... and whether the Township and the Association are bound by the exclusion.\u201d Id., at 1100 n. 4.\nThe Association appealed, and we granted allocatur limited to the following issue: \u201c[wjhether the term \u2018recreational activity,\u2019 as contained in the Construction Code, 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.103, is ambiguous, necessitating that this Court apply the rules of statutory construction to ascertain the intent of the Legislature?\u201d Indian Rocks Property Owners Association, Inc. of Ledgedale v. Glatfelter, 600 Pa. 98, 963 A.2d 902, 902-03 (2008). We later expanded our scope of review and requested supplemental briefing from the parties on the following issues:\nAre appellees entitled to build a \u201crecreational cabin,\u201d as defined in 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.103, in the secondary home planned community of Indian Rocks, which had adopted the Pennsylvania Construction Code Act, 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.101 et seq. ?\nAre appellees estopped by the agreement with appellant in July of 2005 from building a \u201crecreational cabin\u201d in the secondary home planned community of Indian Rocks?\nPer Curiam Order, 12/30/10. As our disposition of the third issue will determine whether the other issues need to be addressed, we will discuss it first.\nThe Association argues the Glatfelters are estopped from building a recreational cabin under the doctrines of equitable estoppel, promissory estoppel, and estoppel by judicial admission or stipulation. It notes in the July, 2005 Stipulation, the Glatfelters agreed to submit an application with the Association describing the intended construction, to conform with the Association\u2019s rules and regulations then in effect, and to hire an engineer to monitor construction. The Association contends, based upon these assurances, it agreed to end the proceedings and not seek the fines and penalties it levied against the Glatfelters. The Association also suggests the Glatfelters have impliedly waived the recreational cabin exemption by agreeing to abide by the Association\u2019s rules and regulations, which at the time of the agreement specifically refused to adopt the recreational cabin exemption. Pursuant to these various legal doctrines, the Association concludes it would be unfair for the Glatfelters to circumvent its rules and regulations by claiming a recreational cabin exemption when they agreed to abide by the rules and regulations.\nThe Glatfelters argue the Association\u2019s resolution refusing to recognize the recreational cabin exemption is unenforceable because the Construction Code specifically preempts homeowners\u2019 association rules and regulations. They cite \u00a7 7210.104(d)(2)\u00ae of the Construction Code, which provides \u201ca homeowners\u2019 association or community association shall be preempted from imposing building construction standards or building codes for buildings to be constructed, renovated, altered or modified.\u201d 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.104(d)(2)\u00ae. Thus, they contend, they cannot be estopped from building a recreational cabin because the Association\u2019s rules and regulations are in direct contravention of state law.\nResolution of this issue requires us to interpret the breadth of the Construction Code\u2019s preemption clause; specifically, we must determine the meaning of the phrase \u201cbuilding construction standards or building codes.\u201d Because statutory interpretation is a question of law, our standard of review is de novo, and our scope of review is plenary. See In re Milton Hershey School, 590 Pa. 35, 911 A.2d 1258, 1261 (2006) (citation omitted). \u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921. When interpreting statutes, \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to the rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage.\u201d Id., \u00a7 1903. If the words of a statute are unambiguous, we are required to interpret the statute in accordance with the plain meaning of the words. Id., \u00a7 1921(b).\nThe Glatfelters suggest because the Construction Code provides for a recreational cabin exemption and the Construction Code preempts homeowners\u2019 associations\u2019 rules and regulations, a homeowners\u2019 association cannot prevent a landowner from building a recreational cabin. Such an interpretation requires a very broad reading of the phrase \u201cbuilding code standards or building codes\u201d found in the preemption clause. The Construction Code does not define \u201cbuilding code standards\u201d or \u201cbuilding codes\u201d; therefore, we look to the intent of the General Assembly in enacting the Construction Code and the ordinary meaning of the relevant phrases.\nThe Construction Code\u2019s purpose is to \u201cprovide standards for the protection of life, health, property and environment and for the safety and welfare of the consumer, general public and the owners and occupants of buildings and structures.\u201d 35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.102(b)(1). With that purpose in mind, we understand \u201cbuilding code standards or building codes\u201d to refer to the materials, manner, and methods of construction\u2014 the nuts and bolts so to speak \u2014 which ensure a structure\u2019s safety. For example, the Construction Code specifies the depth of a stair tread, 34 Pa.Code \u00a7 403.21(6)(ii), and whether smoke alarms should be interconnected. Id., \u00a7 403.21(6)(i).\nIndeed, the Construction Code is voluminous and covers nearly every component of a structure. What it does not cover, however, are the more aesthetic features of a building. The Construction Code does not say whether you can have blue shutters on a green exterior or whether you are permitted to install a satellite dish on your roof. Therefore, while a homeowners\u2019 association is preempted from establishing codes related to stair treads, it is not preempted from enforcing more subjective requirements, such as a proposed structure\u2019s harmony with other structures. To hold that the Legislature intended to preempt all homeowners\u2019 associations\u2019 rules and regulations would lead to the absurd result of disbanding all homeowners\u2019 associations in the Commonwealth \u2014 a result we must presume the Legislature did not intend. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1) (General Assembly does not intend result that is absurd, impossible of execution, or unreasonable).\nTurning to the stipulation entered between the parties, the Glatfelters agreed to abide by the Association\u2019s rules and regulations. Chief among those rules and regulations is Article VIII, \u00a7 1 of the Covenants, which provides all \u201c \u2018building, excavation, exterior remodeling or altering of any structure, wall or fence shall [not] be commenced without obtaining written approval of the Developer ... as to the location, elevation, set back from property lines, construction materials, quality of workm[a]nship and harmony of external design with existing structures.\u2019 \u201d Indian Rocks, at 1095 (quoting Association\u2019s Official Handbook). In other words, the Association has broad discretion in determining what can or cannot be built within its community, and, for better or worse, the Glatfelters agreed to obtain approval from the Association regarding their intended structure. The Glatfelters cannot use the recreational cabin exemption as a trump card to bypass the rules and regulations to which they agreed. As stated above, the Construction Code could preempt the Association\u2019s regulations relating to construction materials and processes, but it does not preempt the Association\u2019s ability to refuse a structure for other reasons, including the harmony with other structures and, to some degree, the quality of workmanship.\nHaving determined the Glatfelters agreed to obtain the approval of the Association regarding the intended structure and that approval has not been granted, we need not address the remaining issues. Accordingly, we reverse the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order reversing the trial court\u2019s finding John P. Glatfelter in contempt.\nOrder reversed.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nJustices McCAFFERY and ORIE MELVIN join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\nJustice BAER files a concurring opinion in which Chief Justice CASTILLE joins.\nJustice TODD files a concurring opinion.\n. Department of Labor and Industry Form UCC-13.\n. Section 7210.301(d)(1) of the Construction Code similarly states:\nThe regulations adopted by the department implementing these codes shall supersede and preempt all local building codes regulating any aspect of construction, alteration and repair of buildings adopted or enforced by any municipality or authority or pursuant to any deed restriction, rule, regulation, ordinance, resolution, tariff or order of any public utility or any State or local board, agency, commission or homeowners\u2019 association except as may be otherwise specifically provided in this act.\n35 P.S. \u00a7 7210.301(d)(1).\n. To be clear, we are not holding the Glatfelters agreed to abide by the Association's resolution that rejected the recreational cabin exemption. Our holding is premised entirely on the Glatfelters' failure to obtain the Association\u2019s approval regarding the intended structure. Accordingly, we need not address the validity of the Association\u2019s resolution refusing to adopt the recreational cabin exemption.\n. John P. Glatfelter passed away in 1990; therefore, it is unclear why the trial court entered the order against him. However, neither party addressed this issue; therefore, we will not address it either."}
