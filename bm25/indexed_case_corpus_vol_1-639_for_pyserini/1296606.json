{"id": "1296606", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nPlaintiff brought an action for personal injuries; the jury returned a verdict for defendant. The trial Judge died; a substituted Judge granted a new trial for the sole reason that the trial Judge committed basic error in 'charging that all plaintiff established was the \u201cdefendant was slightly remiss in his duties.\u201d Defendant took this appeal.\nAt approximately 4:30 a.m. on March 31, 1956, defendant Avas driving his automobile east on Route 28 from New Kensington toward Tarentum. He was driving in his right-hand lane. Michael Segriff, the victim of the accident, had been coming from New Kensington. He was 73 years old; he died a natural death before the trial, and consequently his administrator was substituted. In order to make out a case, plaintiff had to rely on the testimony of defendant \u2014 called as on cross-examination \u2014 and of a police officer who happened to be following defendant in another automobile. Route 28 at the point of the accident is a three lane highway, 41 feet wide. On the left side of the highway is a paved sidewalk; on the right side where the accident.occurred there was no sidewalk, but only a dirt pathway adjoining the curb. There were no buildings along the right side of the highway, but there was a large junk yard opposite the point of the accident. The nearest light was approximately 75 feet from the point of the accident and it and several other lights nearby were on the left-hand side of the road. Defendant, we repeat, was driving on the right-hand side of the road. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony showed that at the time of the accident (and for some time before) it was dark, there was a drizzling rain and visibility was poor. Defendant was driving about 35 miles an hour, lie testified that although it was raining and the visibility was poor, he could see approximately 100 feet in front of his car \u2014 he was watching the road ahead of him in the vision or range of his automobile headlights and there was nobody there to see and he sa/w no one. Suddenly defendant felt a bump on the right side of his car and out of the corner of his eye caught a glimpse of an object which he was unable to identify. lie was driving approximately 5 or 6 feet from the edge of the dirt pathway and the left wheels of his car straddled the dividing line between the first and second lanes. He brought his car to a stop within approximately 75 feet and went back to discover what had happened. He found Segriff lying near the curb on the right side of Eoute 28, with his head and feet approximately 2 to 3 feet from the right-hand curb. Officer Novosat, who was following defendant in his automobile, testified for plaintiff that defendant said, to him \u201cI did not see the man and I hit him.\u201d There were marks on the side of the right front fender of defendant\u2019s automobile 8 inches back of the right front headlight, and the radio aerial \u2014 which was 2 inches from the windshield on the right side of defendant\u2019s car- \u2014 -was bent. There was no damage to or marks on any part of the front of defendant\u2019s car. Plaintiff produced no evidence which would justify a finding as to where decedent was at the time of or just before the accident \u2014 whether he was in the highway or had stepped from the dirt path, or had come out of the junk area. The officer did not see the accident itself, but corroborated defendant\u2019s testimony in all material respects, namely, as to defendant\u2019s speed, the weather conditions, defendant\u2019s description of the roadway, and the physical evidence of defendant\u2019s car.\nThis case was obviously one for the jury and the jury, who saw and heard the witnesses and saw the photographs, found in favor of defendant. The charge of the trial Judge, John J. Kennedy, was able and very fair on the subject of negligence, contributory negligence and a summarization of the facts. When, however, he came to the subject of damages, he said:\n\u201c. . . The test is that the amount that you allow is in the nature of compensation, not in the nature of punishing the defendant through his pocketbook. There is no claim here that this defendant wanted to hit this man on this night, if he hit him, as distinguished from him walking into the side of his car. All the claim here is that this defendant was slightly remiss in his duties to this plaintiff at the time the accident occurred, and as a result of his laxness or remission or inattention, and so forth, that had he been alert he would have seen him on the road, and he didn\u2019t see him and he ran him down, but there is no claim here that 'he wanted to hurt him. So it is only that he was negligent, that he was not acting with due care, and as a result that this man was badly hurt. So that the pain and suffering and inconvenience item, if you are going to find for the plaintiff in this case, would be in the realm of compensation.\u201d\nThis charge must be considered not only in the light of the evidence, but also in the light of the fact that plaintiff had averred in his complaint and had contended in his address to the jury that defendant was guilty of gross and wanton negligence in striking plaintiff when he was lawfully walking along the highway. It is crystal clear that there was no gross and wanton negligence, and it is equally clear that the trial Judge\u2019s charge was directed to this contention. Not only did counsel for plaintiff fail to take an exception to this part of the Court\u2019s charge, but the trial Judge called both counsel to side bar following his charge and asked \u201cNow, does counsel for either party have any suggestions, additions, or corrections, amplifications?\u201d Counsel had none.\nAs Chief Justice Jones said: \u201ca party may not sit by silent, take his chances on a verdict, and, if it is adverse, then complain of matter which, if error, could have been eradicated during the trial if brought to the court\u2019s attention properly and timely. Keefer v. Byers [398 Pa. 447, 159 A. 2d 477]; Commonwealth v. Kazmus, 210 Pa. 609, 611, 60 A. 264.\u201d Bell v. Yellow Cab Co., 399 Pa. 332, 338-39, 160 A. 2d 437. '\u201cA proper administration of justice requires that new trials be not granted on errors which counsel had ample opportunity to correct. It is only when errors are basic and fundamental and cannot be corrected at the trial that this Court will consider them under a general exception : Medvidovich v. Schultz, 309 Pa. 450; Whitton v. H. A. Gable Co., 331 Pa. 429.\u201d McDonald v. Ferrebee, 366 Pa. 543, 547, 79 A. 2d 232.\nMoreover a charge of the Court must be considered in its entirety; isolated portions thereof, even if erroneous, will not justify a new trial unless they constitute basic, fundamental and prejudicial error: James v. Ferguson, 401 Pa. 92, 162 A. 2d 690; McDonald v. Ferrebee, supra; Giannone v. Reale, 333 Pa. 21, 3 A. 2d 331; Commonwealth v. Kloiber, 378 Pa. 412, 106 A. 2d 820; Commonwealth v. Clanton, 395 Pa. 521, 151 A. 2d 88; Commonwealth v. Richardson, 392 Pa. 528, 140 A. 2d 828; Commonwealth v. Donough, 377 Pa. 46, 103 A. 2d 694; Commonwealth v. Patskin, 372 Pa. 402, 93 A. 2d 704.\nUnder all the above mentioned facts and circumstances of this case we consider that the words \u201cslightly remiss\u201d in that portion of the charge which related to damages was harmless and not fundamental basic error.\nWe will not reverse the grant of a new trial unless (1) there was a clear abuse of discretion or (2) an error of law which controlled the outcome of the case, and the error is the sole reason for granting a new trial: Muroski v. Hnath, 382 Pa. 233, 139 A. 2d 902; Londrino v. Equitable Life Assurance Society, 377 Pa. 543, 105 A. 2d 333; Fitzpatrick v. Sheppard, 346 Pa. 240, 29 A. 2d 475; Beal v. Beading Co., 370 Pa. 45, 87 A. 2d 214; Sess v. Gusdorff, 274 Pa. 123, 117 A. 671; Samuels v. Johnson, 355 Pa. 624, 50 A. 2d 670; Bellettiere v. Philadelphia, 367 Pa. 638, 81 A. 2d 857. See also Bell v. Yellow Cab Co., 399 Pa. 332, 334, 343-344, 160 A. 2d 437.\nThe grant of a new trial was under all the circumstances clear error.\nJudgment reversed and here entered on the verdict for defendant.\nItalics throughout, ours."}
