{"id": "765943", "contents": "OPINION\nNEWMAN, Justice.\nJeffrey H. Cohen (Cohen) appeals from an Order of the Superior Court that reversed an Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Family Division (trial court) directing Lisa A. Goldberg (Goldberg) to pay Cohen approximately one hundred twenty-seven thousand dollars ($127,-000. 00) as his 50 percent share of their marital estate. The issue in this appeal is whether Goldberg is entitled to recoupment of certain loans discharged in Cohen\u2019s bankruptcy.\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nThe parties were married on September 4, 1988. Immediately prior to the marriage, they entered into a Premarital Agreement by which both parties agreed that, if there were a divorce, they would divide the marital property equally between them. During the marriage, Cohen, a pediatric ophthalmologist, borrowed various sums of money from Goldberg, a dermatologist, to support Cohen\u2019s failing medical practice.\nOn the advice of Goldberg\u2019s attorney and accountant, some of the loans were formalized in writing. In 1988, Cohen signed a promissory note to Goldberg in the amount of four thousand dollars ($4,000.00), and in 1991, Cohen signed another promissory note in the amount of one hundred two thousand dollars ($102,000.00). Goldberg also made additional loans to Cohen, totaling approximately fifty thousand dollars ($50,000.00), which were not evidenced by promissory notes. All of the loans were unsecured and interest free.\nOn May 18, 1992, Cohen, whose medical practice was no longer financially viable, filed a voluntary Petition for Relief pursuant to Chapter 7 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701 et seq. Cohen listed Goldberg as an unsecured nonpriority creditor, and Goldberg filed a Proof of Claim for amounts owed pursuant to the loans. The Proof of Claim was allowed, but Goldberg received no distribution when Cohen\u2019s bankruptcy was discharged on September 22, 1992. Goldberg did not object to the discharge.\nShortly after that, the parties separated, and on May 19, 1994, Cohen filed a Complaint for Divorce. With respect to the equitable distribution of the marital property, Goldberg argued that she was entitled to a setoff or recoupment against Cohen\u2019s share of the property to compensate for the loans discharged in Cohen\u2019s bankruptcy. Following a hearing, the trial court concluded that Goldberg was not entitled to any setoff or recoupment. Accordingly, pursuant to the Premarital Agreement, the court divided the marital properly evenly between the parties.\nGoldberg appealed to the Superior Court, which, in a published Opinion, reversed the Order of the trial court. The Superior Court reviewed the doctrines of setoff and recoupment in the context of bankruptcy, noting that, \u201cthe doctrine of recoupment is limited only by the requirement that both debts arise \u2018from the same transaction.\u2019 \u201d Cohen v. Goldberg, 695 A.2d 806, 809 (Pa.Super.1997) (quoting 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 553.03 (Lawrence P. King, ed., 15th ed.1992)). The court concluded that, while Goldberg was not entitled to a setoff, she was entitled to recoupment of the amounts discharged in Cohen\u2019s bankruptcy:\nInstantly, there can be no doubt that [Goldberg\u2019s] loans to [Cohen] were made only because the parties were spouses---- It is equally obvious that [Goldberg] would not have incurred the equitable distribution debt but for the marriage. To now permit [Cohen] to escape recoupment by claiming that the loans from [Goldberg] and the equitable distribution proceeding are different transactions would be to ignore the common element giving rise to both debts, and without which neither would exist.* This result can be avoided only by construing the parties\u2019 marriage as a single transaction from which both debts arose.\nId., at 810-11. We find, however, that the Superior Court erred in determining that the parties\u2019 marriage constituted a single transaction for purposes of recoupment. Therefore, we reverse.\nDISCUSSION\nAlthough there is no recoupment provision in the Bankruptcy Code, bankruptcy law recognizes the common law doctrine of recoupment:\nRecoupment \u201cis the setting up of a demand arising from the same transaction, as the plaintiffs claim or cause of action, strictly for the purpose of abatement or reduction of such claim.\u201d [Quoting 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00a7 553.03 (Lawrence P. King, ed., 15th ed.1992) (emphasis added) ]. This doctrine is justified on the grounds that \u201cwhere the creditor\u2019s claim against the debtor arises from the same transaction as the debtor\u2019s claim, it is essentially a defense to the debtor\u2019s claim against the creditor rather than a mutual obligation, and application of the limitations on setoff in bankruptcy would be inequitable.\u201d [Quoting Lee v. Schweiker, 739 F.2d 870, 875 (3d Cir.1984)].\nUniversity Medical Center v. Sullivan, 973 F.2d 1065, 1079-80 (3d Cir.1992). Federal courts have consistently held that the \u201csame transaction\u201d requirement must be interpreted quite narrowly. See, e.g., In re B & L Oil Co., 782 F.2d 155 (10th Cir.1986); Lee, supra. For example, in University Medical Center, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held as follows:\nFor the purposes of recoupment, a mere logical relationship is not enough; the \u201cfact that the same two parties are involved, and that a similar subject matter gave rise to both claims, ... does not mean that the two arose from the \u2018same transaction.\u2019\u201d [Quoting Lee, 739 F.2d at 875]. Rather, both debts must arise out of a single integrated transaction so that it would be inequitable for the debtor to enjoy the benefits of that transaction without also meeting its obligations.\nId., at 1081. Accord In re Peterson Distributing, Inc., 82 F.3d 956 (10th Cir.1996); Reading Company v. City of Phila delphia, 155 B.R. 890 (E.D.Pa.1993); In re Women\u2019s Technical Institute, 200 B.R. 77 (Bankr.D.Mass.1996). The most common application of the doctrine of recoupment in bankruptcy is where \u201ceither the creditor has made some type of overpayment to the debtor or both the creditor and the debtor have claims arising from a single contract.\u201d Reading Company, 155 B.R. at 911.\nConsidering these analytical guidelines, the Superior Court\u2019s construing the parties\u2019 marriage as a single transaction for purposes of recoupment was clearly erroneous. In the first instance, we question whether, in the context of recoupment, the union of two individuals in the bonds of matrimony and their subsequent life together can be considered a \u201ctransaction\u201d at all. Even if it could, we would have to consider the parties\u2019 divorce to be a separate \u201ctransaction,\u201d which would negate a claim for recoupment arising out of equitable distribution proceedings.\nMoreover, the Superior Court\u2019s finding that the parties\u2019 marriage was a \u201ccommon element giving rise to both debts, and without which neither would exist,\u201d Cohen v. Goldberg, 695 A.2d at 811, is insufficient to render the marriage a single transaction for purposes of recoupment. \u201cA set of common facts differs substantially from a single transaction or a single series of transactions that gives rise to both a debtor\u2019s and a creditor\u2019s claims against each other.\u201d Reading Company, 155 B.R. at 912. Pursuant to the Superior Court\u2019s sweeping construction, any ongoing interpersonal relationship could constitute a \u201csingle transaction\u201d for purposes of recoupment, and the rule would therefore become meaningless.\nTo effectuate the policies of the Bankruptcy Code, including the paramount goal of affording the debtor a \u201cfresh start,\u201d the single transaction requirement must be narrowly construed. See, e.g., University Medical Center, supra; Lee, supra. The Superior Court, however, chose to neglect the fresh start policy in favor of general \u201cequitable\u201d concerns, and therefore stretched the single transaction requirement beyond its accepted meaning. This was error.\nPursuant to well settled bankruptcy law precedent, Goldberg\u2019s loans to Cohen, some of which were evidenced by separate promissory notes, plainly constituted separate transactions to which the doctrine of recoupment could not apply. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court.\nSAYLOR, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nZAPPALA, J., files a concurring opinion in which CASTILLE, J., joins.\n.
