{"id": "1047515", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis case was clearly for the jury, and this is all that need be said in dismissing the third and fourth assignments. They allege error in the refusal of the court to direct a verdict for the defendant, and in the dismissal of its motion for judgment n. o. v. Nothing appears in the brief of counsel for appellant in support of the first, and the second merely complains of the refusal to grant a new trial.\nJudgment affirmed."}
