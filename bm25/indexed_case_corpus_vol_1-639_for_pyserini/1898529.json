{"id": "1898529", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThis is an appeal by condemnees from the dismissal by the Court of Common Pleas, of their preliminary objections, to a Declaration of Taking under the Eminent Domain Code of 1964.\nOn December 14, 1962, Hugh Moore, Jr., was appointed a member of the Redevelopment' Authority of the City of Easton, Pennsylvania. At the time of his appointment, Moore was under contract, to furnish architectural services to the Redeveloper selected by the Authority. This contract was still in force when he resigned from the Authority on September 1, 1964.\nMoore voted on four resolutions during the period of his membership on the Authority. These four resolutions were preliminary steps necessary for and leading to the condemnation. However, the Declaration of Taking is the actual condemnation which becomes binding and effective only after authorized by final vote of the Authority and the filing of the Declaration. This last step and final vote was taken by the members of the Authority on September 14, 1964, which was two weeks after Moore had resigned, and the Declaration -was filed on September 15, 1964.\nThe condemnees contest the validity of this condemnation because of Moore\u2019s conflict of. interest, while the Redevelopment Authority moved to quash the appeal because the lower Court\u2019s Order was interlocutory and should have been brought under Rule 68%, but was not. We shall discuss these in inverse order.\nArticle Four of the Eminent Domain Code deals with the procedure to condemn.\nSection 406 thereof provides: \u201c(a) Within thirty days after being served with notice of condemnation, the condemnee may file preliminary objections to the declaration of taking .... Preliminary objections shall be limited to and shall be the exclnsive method of challenging (1) the power or right of the condemnor to appropriate the condemned property unless the same has been previously adjudicated; (2) the sufficiency of the security; (3) any other procedure followed by the condemnor; or (4) the declaration of talcing. Failure to raise these matters by preliminary objections shall constitute a waiver thereof.\n\u201c(d) The condemnee shall serve a copy of the preliminary objections on the condemnor within seventy-two hours after filing the same.\n\u201c(e) The court [of Common Pleas] shall determine promptly all preliminary objections and make such preliminary and final orders and decrees as justice shall require, including the revesting of title.. . . .\u201d\n. Article Five deals with the procedure for determining damages, and provides in Section 515: \u201cAny party aggrieved by the decision of the viewers may appeal to the court of common pleas within thirty days from the filing of the report. The appeal shall raise all objections of law or fact to the viewers\u2019 report.\u201d\nSection 523 provides: \u201cEither party may appeal to the Supreme or Superior Court as the case may be, from any final order or judgment of the court of common pleas within forty-five days from the entry thereof.\u201d\nSection 406, supra, provides, as above noted, that preliminary objections shall be the exclusive method of challenging the power or right to condemn or the declaration of taking; and that the Court of Common Pleas shall \u201c. . . make such preliminary and final orders and decrees as justice shall require . . . .\u201d Clearly, the Court of Common Pleas is empowered to make preliminary Orders or final Orders relating to preliminary objections, and either party may appeal from a final Order to the Supreme Court or the Superior Court, as the case may be.\nWhen the Order of a lower Court so restricts a party\u2019s further action as virtually to put (him or) it out of Court upon the question or cause which is being litigated, the Order is final and therefore appealable. Cf. Central. Con. Co. v. Youngdahl & Co., Inc., 418 Pa. 122, 209 A. 2d 810, and Sullivan v. Philadelphia, 378 Pa. 648, 107 A. 2d 854. We believe that the Order appealed from was a final Order and hence appealable.\n- The Authority also contends that this appeal cannot be considered because it came within- Rule 68% and was not brought or allowed thereunder. This contention is completely devoid of merit. Rule 68% does not apply here, because the Eminent Domain Statute, in \u00a7523, specifically confers a right to appeal to this Court.\nJanuary 18, 1966:\nContentions of Condemnees\nCondemnees contend (1) (a) that Moore\u2019s vote was illegal because of a conflict of interest, and (b) was necessary for passage of the Declaration of Taking, and (2) that the Declaration of Taking was an integral part of the entire proceedings which were void ab initio and could not be ratified. We disagree with these contentions. Section 8 of the Redevelopment Law of May 24, 1945, P. L. 991, 35 P.S. \u00a71708, as amended, does not make void or nullify Moore\u2019s vote and actions, but merely makes an undisclosed conflict of interest a \u201cmisconduct in office\u201d. Moreover the final and important and controlling Declaration of Taking was authorized and filed, as we have seen, by vote of the Authority when Moore was no longer a member or had any vote.\nWe find no merit in any contention of the condemnees.\nOrder affirmed.\nMr. Justice Roberts concurs in the result.\nAct of June 22, 1964, P. L. 84, 26 P.S. \u00a7\u00a71-101 to 1-903.\nAct of June 22, 1964, P. L. 84, 26 P.S. \u00a7\u00a71-401 to 1-410.\nAct of June 22, 1964, P. L. 84, 26 P.S. \u00a71-406.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nAct of June 22, 1964, P. L. 84, 26 P.S. \u00a71-523.\nWhile there was originaUy a conflict of interest on the part of Moore, no one alleges that he or the Authority was guilty of fraud."}
