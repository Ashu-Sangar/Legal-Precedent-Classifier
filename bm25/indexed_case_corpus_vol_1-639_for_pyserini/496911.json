{"id": "496911", "contents": "Mr. Justice Green\ndelivered tlie opinion of the court,\nWe find no serious error in tins record until we come to tbe answer of tbe court below to tbe defendant\u2019s twelfth point. Tins point called upon tbe court to lay down a rule to govern tbe jury in fixing tbe value of tbe building, and it should have been affirmed, Tbe answer neither affirms nor denies\u2019 tbe point. In fact, it cannot be said to be responsive. We have no fault with that part of it which says: \u201cIf tbe jury find that there was actual submission of this loss to tbe determination of arbitrators, and sucli determination lias been made without fraud on tbe part of tbe plaintiff, or tbe arbitrators, or gross mistake, it is binding upon both parties.\u201d After stating tbe converse of this proposition tbe learned judge said : \u201c Then tbe value put by them upon tbe building is not conclusive, and tbe jury are at liberty to adjust this loss upon tbe proofs before' them.\u201d Put bow adjust tbe loss upon tbe proofs before them? It was just here tbe point was intended to indicate tbe rule, and tbe answer wholly fails to furnish it. This was error.\nJudgment reversed and a venire facias de novo awarded."}
