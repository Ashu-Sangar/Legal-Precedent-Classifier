{"id": "1272530", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nThis is an appeal from a final order of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Lackawanna County refusing to permit the opening and review of an account in this decedent\u2019s estate.\nM. E. Comerford died, testate, on February 1, 1939. Three provisions of his will are relevant to this appeal: a provision creating a trust in stock of a Delaware corporation known as Penncom Corporation, a provision disposing of his residuary estate and a provision appointing two executors.\nItem 7 of the will created a trust of which the entire res was such capital stock of Penncom Corporation (hereinafter called Penncom) decedent owned, either in his own right or as trustee, at the time of his death; two nephews, Frank C. Walker and M. B. Comerford, were named the trustees. Decedent disposed of the remainder of his estate as follows: (1) to Margaret Comerford, his widow, a l/3rd interest; (2) to Mariel Comerford, a niece, a l/9th interest; (3) to six nieces and nephews, children of a deceased sister, Ellen Walker, a l/9th interest; (4) to six nieces and nephews, children of a deceased brother, Patrick Comerford, a l/9th interest; (5) to a brother, John Comer-ford, and a sister, Margaret Cary, each a l/9th interest; (6) to five nieces and nephews, children of a deceased sister, Mary Collins, a l/9th interest. Two nephews, Frank C. Walker and M. B. Comerford, were named as executors under the will.\nUpon probate of decedent\u2019s will, letters testamentary were issued to the appellee, Frank C. Walker, his co-executor, M. B. Comerford, having predeceased the decedent. Approximately one year later \u2014 January 31, 1940 \u2014 an inventory was filed which listed assets valued at $1,739,771.32.\nNo account was filed by the appellee until February Uf, 1955 \u2014 16 years after the grant of letters.\nThe appellee filed his first account on February 14, 1955 and this account was advertised for confirmation nisi on June 6, 1955 and final confirmation \u00f3n June 17, 1955. After confirmation nisi of this account on June 6, 1955, the lower court permitted appellee to withdraw and amend the account and extended the date of final confirmation to September 22, 1955. The amended account \u2014 filed August 23, 1955 \u2014 was confirmed nisi on September 12, 1955 and the time for final confirmation extended, at appellant\u2019s request, to October 31, 1955. In February 1956 \u2014 due to a procedural change in the Orphans\u2019 Court Rules of Lackawanna County \u2014 notice was given by publication of the filing of this account and that it would be presented to the court for confirmation nisi on March 5, 1956 and, if no objections were filed by March 16, 1956, the account would be audited on March 20, 1956. The account was confirmed nisi on March 5, 1956 and presented for audit on March 20, 1956.\nOn September 21, 1955, the five children of M. R. Comerford, a deceased nephew (holders of a l/54th interest in decedent\u2019s estate), filed 41 exceptions to the appellee\u2019s account of August 23, 1955.\nThese exceptions charged appellee with malfeasance, nonfeasance and misfeasance in his administration of this estate. These exceptions charged, inter alia: (1) that appellee, without authority, borrowed in excess of one and a half million dollars; (2) that appellee failed to include in the account all the assets and income of the estate; (3) that appellee over a 13 year period \u2014 up to 1952 \u2014 improperly advanced to legatees (other than exceptants who received no advances) amounts in excess of $1,000,000; (4) that capital losses occurred in some of decedent\u2019s business ventures which were attributable to appellee\u2019s mismanagement of these ventures; (5) that the account shows a fictitious \u201ccredit due decedent\u201d of approximately two and a half million dollars which was created by the alteration on or about March 15, 1955 of certain book entries and records; (6) that appellee was dilatory in completing the administration of the estate and as a result thereof the estate was subjected to large interest and penalty payments on estate and inheritance taxes and excessive income taxes; (7) that appellee failed to convert securities, particularly so-called nonlegal securities, with a resultant loss to the estate; (8) that appellee commingled estate funds with funds of certain individuals, other estates and corporations; (9) that appellee violated the rule against \u201cself-dealing\u201d in his administration of the estate; (10) that in the account of February 14, 1955 appellee set forth that the estate had liabilities in excess of one and one-half million dollars, whereas in this account all liabilities have been eliminated; (11) that appellee, together with one J. J. O\u2019Leary, acting in fiduciary capacities, engaged in borrowing from certain accounts for the purpose of concealing corporate earnings, facilitating unequal distributions in this and two other estates, postponing settlement of these estates and maintaining complete control over the various Comer-ford corporations.\nOn December 15, 1955, with the lower court\u2019s approval, these exceptions were withdrawn and the account confirmed finally on the same date.\nAt the audit of the account \u2014 March 20, 1956 \u2014 appellant (holder of a l/54th interest) petitioned the court to open and review the account for reasons referred to infra. After hearing, the court refused to open and review the account. Exceptions having been taken to this order, appellant then petitioned the court for a rule to take testimony in support of her exceptions. On August 24, 1956 the court confirmed the audit, dismissed the exceptions, discharged the rule to take testimony and refused to open and review the account. From that order this appeal was taken.\nAppellant\u2019s request to open and review the account had a two-fold purpose: (1) to determine whether decedent at the time of his death owned any Penncom stock and (2) to determine whether the executor had unlawfully and improperly used an estate asset \u2014 1,000 shares of Penn State Realty, Inc. stock \u2014 to secure a personal advantage, i.e. the withdrawal of the exceptions charging him with mismanagement of the estate.\nPenncom stock\nAppellee\u2019s position is that at the time of death decedent did not own, either individually or as a trustee, any Penncom stock, in that decedent had divested himself of any ownership therein prior to his death. Appellee points out that Penncom stock is listed neither in the inventory nor the account and that the only reference thereto appears in a note in the petition for distribution: \u201cM. E. Comerford, decedent, divested himself of all stock in the Penn Com Corporation previous to his demise, and therefore Item 7 of his Will became inoperative.\u201d\nHowever, the record indicates that on January 13, 1951 \u2014 approximately 12 years after decedent\u2019s death and approximately 11 years subsequent to filing his inventory \u2014 appellee, acting in the capacity of a trustee under Item 7 of the will, caused to be filed in the Register of Wills\u2019 Office in Lackawanna County an appointment of one J. J. O\u2019Leary as successor-trustee to M. B. Comerford. This order of appointment recited that Frank C. Walker, appellee, in pursuance of the power vested in him under Item 7 of decedent\u2019s will, appointed J. J. O\u2019Leary as a successor-trustee to take the place of M. B. Comerford, deceased. It is to be noted that Item 7 of the will deals entirely and exclusively with Penncom stock, the only duties of the trustees named therein would be in connection with Penncom stock and without Penncom stock the trust would be inoperative.\nIt is sophistic for the amicus curiae to argue, as she does in her brief: \u201cNote that M. E. Comerford did not state that he owned any Penncom stock when he drew his will in 1934. He did not state that any stood in his name as Trustee.\u201d It is inconceivable that decedent, preparing for the disposition of his wordly assets, Avould create a trust, name trustees and set forth in detail the terms of the trust if he did not then own, either as an individual or as a trustee, the stock which was to be the entire res of the trust. This statement of. the amicus curiae is at variance with appellee\u2019s position that decedent did own but had divested himself of ownership in this stock.\nThe order of appointment, in itself, raises a serious doubt concerning the validity of appellee\u2019s position with respect to the Penncom stock. If decedent did not own, directly or indirectly, any Penncom stock when he died, \u2014 appellee, as excutor, was bound to ascertain such fact \u2014 and, if appellee did conclude that decedent had divested himself of ownership of this stock, why then did the appellee 12 years later appoint a co-trustee under Item 7 of the will? Why did appellee appoint a co-trustee to hold stock which he now says he always knew decedent did not own when he died? We cannot assume the reason for appellee\u2019s action in making this appointment; we only know that, superficially at least, appellee\u2019s action in making this appointment appears inconsistent with his present position. All that appellant requests is an explanation for this apparent inconsistency.\nOn July 2, 1956 \u2014 5 months after appellee filed the \u2022first account and 6 weeks prior to the last account\u2014 articles of merger were filed with the Department of State of this Commonwealth merging 36 so-called \u201cComerford Corporations\u201d into the Meco Realty Company. The articles of merger recited, inter alia, that: (1) Penncom was a holding company which owned 100% of the stock of the Comerford Publix Corporation, Comerford Publix Theatres Corporation and Midas Theatres Corporation; (2) that 21 named corporations owned 100% of the stock of Penncom; (3) \u201call of the stock of the above named companies (including the 21 companies owning 100% of the stock of Penncom Corporation) is owned, directly or indirectly, in the following proportions: One-third by the Estate of M. E. Comerford; one-third by Frank C. Walker and one-third by Penn State Realty, Inc. The ownership before and after the merger will be identical.\u201d (That which appears in parenthesis, together with emphasis, is supplied). Appellee set forth under oath that these statements were true and correct. After the argument before this court, appellee, in a supplementary written statement, explained that the estate of M. E. Comerford, Frank C. Walker and Penn State Realty, Inc., each owned one-third of Penncom indirectly, in that they each owned one-third of the corporate stock of certain corporations which in turn \u201cown 100% of the stock of Penncom Corporation.\u201d\nThis statement in the articles of merger, even when considered with appellee\u2019s written explanation, increases the orbit of doubt and uncertainty whether decedent had divested himself of ownership of Penncom stock during his lifetime. Coupled with O\u2019Leary\u2019s appointment as trustee, this statement furnishes a reasonable basis to justify an inquiry when and under what circumstances decedent ceased being the owner of this stock. If the appellee did not come into possession of this stock by reason of the fact that decedent had divested himself of ownership therein prior to his death, what possible harm to appellee can result from a disclosure of the facts of such divestiture? On the other hand, the doubt which now arises would be dissipated by a complete revelation of the facts.\nThe learned judge dismissed appellant\u2019s request to reopen and review this account in this respect upon two grounds: first, that appellant\u2019s request was not made timely and, second, that any stock held by anyone as trustee was outside the scope of appellee\u2019s accounting.\nIn Stotesbury Estate, 387 Pa. 591, 594, 128 A. 2d 587, Mr. Chief Justice Jones, speaking for this court, stated: \u201cThe right of any party in interest to a review of a fiduciary\u2019s account, auditor\u2019s report, adjudication or decree of distribution within five years after the final confirmation of the account is clear where the petitioner specifically sets forth the errors therein, that right and justice require the granting of the relief sought and that none of the property involved has been distributed by the personal representative in accordance with a decree of court before the filing of the petition : Section 721 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1949, P. L. 512, 20 PS \u00a7320.721\u201d. In that case this court reversed the lower court\u2019s refusal of a petition to review filed 2 years and 4 months after confirmation of the account.\nAppellee, in his brief, argues that October 31, 1955 was \u201cthe last day, the cut-off date, for appellant to file exceptions and the Account was confirmed finally as to appellant at that time.\u201d On the other hand, the record shows that exceptions to the account, supra, were then pending and remained undisposed of until December 15, 1955; further, the notice by publication of this account stated that if no objections were filed by March 16, 1956 the account would be audited on March 20, 1956. If appellee\u2019s argument be sound, then there was one time limit applicable to appellant and another time limit applicable to others, a result the injustice of which is self-evident. The fact is that the petition for distribution for the first time disclosed appellee\u2019s position that decedent had divested himself of the stock prior to his death and that petition was not filed until the audit on March 20, 1956. On the same day, at audit, appellant raised this question before the lower court and six days thereafter filed a formal answer to the petition for distribution formally raising the question. Not only was the appellant\u2019s objection timely, but it was made when appellee first disclosed his position concerning the Penncom stock. Cf. Stotesbury Estate, supra, p. 595: \u201cThat the petitioners did not raise the question at the time of the audit and confirmation of the account or upon the entry of the adjudication is not valid ground for denying the petitioners the desired relief.\u201d\nAppellant does not seek to require appellee to account for the actions of anyone as trustee. On the contrary, all that appellant requests is a judicial inquiry to determine whether at the time of his death decedent had any right of ownership in Penncom stock. To this inquiry appellant is clearly entitled.\nThe amicus curiae relies on Crisswell\u2019s Estate, 334 Pa. 266, 269, 5 A. 2d 577. The ruling in that case was that an Orphans\u2019 Court was without power to determine the title or ownership of assets which were not in the possession of a decedent at the time of his death and did not come into the possession of the executors. The Orphans\u2019 Court Act of 1951, as amended, vests jurisdiction in the Orphans\u2019 Court to adjudicate the title to personal property not only where it is in the personal representative\u2019s possession but also where it is registered in the name of decedent or his nominee, or alleged by the personal representative to have been in decedent\u2019s possession at the time of his death. Our inquiry is whether appellant has the right to ascertain whether the personalty was in decedent\u2019s possession or registered in his name or that of a nominee when he died. After the facts are ascertained, if neither condition is shown to exist, then the Orphans\u2019 Court would be without jurisdiction; however, until the facts are ascertained by a proper inquiry, the jurisdictional question remains unanswered. Grisswell\u2019s Estate, is clearly inapposite.\nThe learned court below erred in not permitting appellant to pursue an inquiry into the entire question of decedent\u2019s ownership of the Penncom stock.\nPenn state realty, ino. stock\nAppellee\u2019s inventory listed 1,000 shares of stock of Penn State Realty Company (a Delaware Corporation) valued at $386,860.00. Appellee\u2019s account \u2014 filed August 23, 1955 \u2014 listed 1,000 shares of stock of Penn State Realty Company valued at $275,188.72. An examination of the income account indicates that the estate received from this stock over the 16 year period \u2014from the time of decedent\u2019s death \u2014 $414,650 as income or an average of approximately $26,000 a year. This asset was the third most valuable in the estate and produced more income than any other asset.\nAfter M. B. Comerford\u2019s children filed exceptions to the account on September 21, 1955 the docket entries indicate no further step was taken until December 15, 1955 when a stipulation or agreement was filed in court.\nIt is on the basis of this stipulation that appellant seeks a review of the account to determine whether appellee used this valuable estate asset for his own personal advantage. In analyzing the terms of this stipulation a certain factual background must be kept in mind: (1) it was not until after appellee was charged with misfeasance and malfeasance in the management of this estate that the stipulation arose; (2) for upwards of 16 years no distribution of any of the assets had taken place; (3) within two weeks after approval of the stipulation, distribution in kind of the Penn State Realty, Inc. stock was made without the benefit of a court order; (4) Penn State Realty, Inc. was a closed corporation the beneficial interests whereof were owned entirely by relatives of appellee; (5) two of the three directors of the Penn State Realty, Inc. were appellee and J. J. O\u2019Leary, both of whom had been charged with mismanagement as fiduciaries in the several estates, and the third director was one of their attorneys.\nAn examination of the stipulation reveals, by way of preface, certain recitals to the effect that exceptions were filed not only in this estate but in two other estates \u2014 the estates of M. B. and Anna D. Comerford wherein appellee and J. J. O\u2019Leary were co-fiduciaries, that conferences had been held for the purpose of effecting a withdrawal of these exceptions and that the exceptants were now willing to sell their stock in the M. B. and Anna D. Oonxerford estates. This stipulation is not an agreement between the exceptants and Frank G. Walker and J. J. O\u2019Leary in their individual capacities: on the contrary, the stipulation is between the exceptants and Frank G. Walker and J. J. O\u2019Leary as \u201caccountants\u201d, that is, in their fiduciary capacities, This stipulation provided that $1,000,000 was to be paid to the exceptants, not by appellee and O\u2019Leary as individuals, but by appellee and O\u2019Leary as \u201caccountants\u201d (i.e., in their fiduciary capacities), or \u201ctheir nominee\u201d. The \u201cquid pro quo\u201d for the payment of the sum of $1,000,000 and that for which appellee and O\u2019Leary bargained under this stipulation is fivefold: (1) a sale by exceptants to a \u201cnominee of Frank C. Walker\u201d of all their interest in this estate; (2) a purchase of exceptants\u2019 total interest in certain seeurities of the M. B. Comerford estate; (3) a purchase of exceptants\u2019 total interest in certain securities of the Anna D. Comerford estate;10 (4) a general release of the fiduciaries from any liability in all three estates, and (5) a withdrawal of exceptions in all three estates. This stipulation effected a purchase by O\u2019Leary and the appellee, in their fiduciary capacities, not only of the securities in the two estates other than this estate, but also of the withdrawal of charges which ex-ceptants had made concerning the fiduciaries which, if proven, could well have been the basis of extensive personal surcharges. Thus, on record, we have an agreement under which the appellee, in his fiduciary capacity in this estate, and, acting with O\u2019Leary in their fiduciary capacities in the other two estates, will pay $1,000,000 to exceptants, part of the consideration for which is the exoneration of appellee and O\u2019Leary from the charges contained in the exceptions.\nTo raise the million dollars necessary to carry out the terms of the stipulation appellee and O\u2019Leary employed a corporate device. Since the appellee had filed his account, and since by the withdrawal of exceptions the way would be cleared for an early audit of the account, the appellee could anticipate the decree of distribution by a distribution in kind in advance of audit without any order of court. Appellee distributed all the Penn Realty stock to the residuary legatees. Prior to such distribution, appellee, O\u2019Leary and one Thomas Friday, as directors of the corporation, voted to purchase from exceptants their stock in the other two estates. After distribution of the stock, at an annual meeting of the stockholders the directors\u2019 action was ratified, the stock was purchased and the exceptants received $1,000,000. Appellant was unaware of the transaction until it was an accomplished fact.\nIt is the appellee\u2019s position that the device employed was perfectly proper and any inquiry into or interference with such device was beyond the jurisdiction of an Orphans\u2019 Court. It is true, as appellee urges, that the Orphans\u2019 Court has no jurisdiction to regulate the internal affairs of a corporation even though the decedent owned shares of stock in that corporation: Goetz\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 236 Pa. 630, 85 A. 65; Nixon\u2019s Estate 239 Pa. 270, 86 A. 849; Watson\u2019s Estate, 314 Pa. 179, 170 A. 254. The error of the learned court below is clear. Neither the lower court nor this court is called upon in this proceeding to determine the regularity or propriety of the corporate action. On the contrary we are called upon to determine whether appellant has the right to inquire into the propriety and regularity of appellee\u2019s action as the fiduciary of this estate. Did the appellee use his office as a fiduciary to secure for himself a personal financial advantage?\nTo entitle appellant to open and review the account a reason must exist to justify such a request. The instant record clearly evidences such a reason. Appellee was charged in the exceptions to his account with malfeasance, nonfeasance and misfeasance which, if proven, could well have subjected him to a very extensive personal surcharge. While under the shadow of these charges \u2014 whether they could have been sustained or not \u2014 appellee undertook with O\u2019Leary (his co-fiduciary in two other estates in which both he and O\u2019Leary were also under attach by the same persons) to enter into an agreement with the persons who had made these charges. Appellee and O\u2019Leary, acting not as individuals but in their fiduciary capacities as \u201caccountants\u201d in the three estates, agreed to pay those who had made the charges the sum of $1,000,000, not only for the stock in two estates, but also for the withdrawal of the charges which they made against appellee and O\u2019Leary. Appellee, O\u2019Leary and one Thomas F. Friday, as directors of Penn State Realty Company, voted to have that corporation put up the $1,-000,000 on the theory that that corporation was effecting a purchase of the stock held in various corporations by the M. B. and Anna D. Comerford estates. Appellee then distributed the Penn State Realty stock to the legatees in this estate \u2014 the first and only distribution of any asset of this estate in 16 years. The corporation\u2019s stockholders \u2014 most, if not all, of whom are appellee\u2019s relatives \u2014 voted to ratify the action of the directors. The sale was effected, the corporation received the stock in the various corporations held by the M. B. and Anna D. Comerford estates, and appellee and O\u2019Leary received a complete release and clearance of any and all the charges made by exceptants concerning their management of this and the other two estates. Under these circumstances, appellant, as the holder of an interest in this estate \u2014 no matter how comparatively infinitesimal it may be \u2014 clearly has the right to reopen and review this account that the propriety of the appellee\u2019s actions might be inquired into and ascertained.\nIn Meinhard v. Salmon et al., 249 N. Y. 458, 164 N. E. 545, the late Mr. Justice Cardozo said: \u201cA trustee is held to something stricter than the morals of the market place. Not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honor the most sensitive, is then the standard of behavior. As to this there has developed a tradition that is unbending and inveterate. Uncompromising rigidity has been the attitude of courts of equity when petitioned to undermine the rule of undivided loyalty by the \u2018disintegrating erosion\u2019 of particular exceptions. Wendt v. Fisher, 243 N. Y. 439, 444, 154 N. E. 303. Only thus has the level of conduct for fiduciaries been kept at a level higher than that trodden by the crowd. It will not consciously be lowered by any judgment of this court.\u201d\nMr. Justice Bell, speaking for this court, in Steele Estate, 377 Pa. 250, 257, 103 A. 2d 409, stated: \u201cThe general principle is well settled that a trustee is under a duty to the trust estate and the beneficiaries thereof to administer the trust solely in their interests, and he may not profit at the expense of the trust estate or the beneficiaries thereof: Flagg Estate, 365 Pa. 82, 73 A. 2d 411; Union Real Estate Investment Co. Case, 331 Pa. 569, 1 A. 2d 662; Restatement, Trusts, \u00a7170(1); Noonan Estate, 381 Pa. 26, 31, 63 A. 2d 80.\u201d\nMr. Chief Justice Jones in Noonan Estate, supra, pp. 30, 31, 32, 33, excellently outlined an executor\u2019s duty of loyalty: \u201cAn executor is a fiduciary no less than is a trustee (Restatement, Trusts, \u00a76, Comment i.) and, as such, primarily owes a duty of loyalty to a beneficiary of his trust: Restatement, Trusts, \u00a7170(1). Under Comment p. of the latter section of the Restatement, the rule is given presently pertinent specification in the following language: \u201cThe trustee is under a duty to the beneficiary in administering the trust not to be guided by the interest of any third person. Thus, it is improper for the trustee to sell trust property to a third person for the purpose of benefiting the \u25a0 third person rather than the trust estate.\u2019 . . . \u2018He that is intrusted with the interest of others, cannot be allowed to make the business an object of interest to himself; because, from the frailty of nature, one who has the power, will be too readily seized with the inclination to use the opportunity for serving his own interest at the expense of those for whom he is intrusted\u2019: Beeson v. Beeson, 9 Pa. 279, 284.\n\u201cThe executor was, moreover, guilty of self-dealing, as the circumstances attending the sale disclose. Such a transgression does not lie exclusively in a fiduciary\u2019s sale of trust property to himself. Cf. Downing Estate, 182 Pa. Superior Ct. 354, 57 A. 2d 710, affirmed per curiam by this Court: 359 Pa. 534, 535, 59 A. 2d 903. The test of forbidden self-dealing is whether the fiduciary had a personal interest in the subject transaction of such a substantial nature that it might have affected his judgment in material connection: Downing Estate, supra, at p. 359, citing Scott on Trusts, Vol. 2, \u00a7170.12, p. 877, and Restatement, Trusts, \u00a7170 (1), Comment h. See also Comment c. of the same section of the Restatement which declares that \u2018The trustee violates his duty to the beneficiary not only where he purchases trust property for himself individually, but also where he has a personal interest in the purchase of such a substantial nature that it might affect his judgment in making the sale.\u2019 It will be noted that the extent of the fiduciary\u2019s disqualifying interest need not be such as \u2018did affect his judgment\u2019 but merely such as \u2018might affect his judgment\u2019: Downing Estate, supra, at p. 360.\n\u201c. . . in Chorpenning\u2019s Appeal, 32 Pa. 315, 316, it was said that \u2018. . . the rule [forbidding self-dealing] is inflexible, without regard to the consideration paid, or the honesty of intent. Public policy requires this, not only as a shield to the parties represented, but as a guard against temptation on part of the representative.\u2019 In Downing Estate, supra, President Judge Rhodes of the Superior Court succinctly summarized the rule at p. 360 as follows: \u2018The prohibition against self-dealing is absolute; where the trustee violates it, good faith or payment of a fair consideration is not material.\u2019 See also Restatement, Trusts, \u00a7170 (1), Comment h.\u201d\nAppellant does not at this stage charge that the appellee was guilty of impropriety of conduct as the executor of this estate; she simply requests the right to reopen this account and review appellee\u2019s actions in order that the court might determine the propriety of appellee\u2019s conduct. The record justifies granting her request.\nThat the withdrawal of the charges made against appellee was a part of the bargain whereby one million dollars was paid to those who made the charges raises the question of self-dealing on the part of an executor. That appellee in his fiduciary capacity entered into an agreement whereby all the exceptants\u2019 interest in this estate was sold to a \u201cnominee\u201d to be designated by him raises the question of his right to delegate his fiduciary duties to another as well as the right of a fiduciary to acquire an interest of a legatee through a purchase of the legatee\u2019s rights. That the appellee, by his use of the corporate device, followed by his distribution of the stock without court order, was in substance effecting a purchase of exceptants\u2019 interest in a group of corporations in which he, as an individual, held a substantial interest raises the question whether appellee can do indirectly that which he could not do directly, i.e. effect a purchase as fiduciary of securities in a corporation in which he is a substantial stockholder. These and other questions which arise from the record require that appellant be granted the right to inquire into the entire transaction involving the stock of the Penn State Realty, Inc.\nWe are not in this proceeding passing upon the question of the propriety or impropriety of the appellee\u2019s conduct. To grant appellant\u2019s petition to open and review this account is not an adjudication that appellee has been guilty of any misconduct whatsoever in connection with this estate; it simply means that the inculpatory, and, if need be, the exculpatory, shall be heard and considered. Kuhns\u2019s Appeal, 87 Pa. 100, 104.\nEven though this is a partial accounting it is final with regard to all that it contains: Rhoad\u2019s Appeal, 3 Wright, 186; Shindel\u2019s Appeal, 57 Pa. 43; McLellan\u2019s Appeal, 76 Pa. 231; Schaeffer\u2019s Appeal, 119 Pa. 640; Galloway\u2019s Estate, 5 Pa. Superior Ct. 272. Since appellee raised in his petition for distribution the question of decedent\u2019s ownership of Penncom stock, and, since the distribution of the Penn Realty stock was presented to the court for ratification and approval, appellant was well within her rights in raising these questions in connection with this account.\nThe order of the court below is reversed and costs of this appeal are placed on the estate.\nWhile the account is not so captioned, the account is treated as a partial account.\nThe trustees were authorized to hold this stock for a 15 year period during which the income was to be paid to decedent\u2019s residuary estate. During this period the trustees, in their discretion, could either seE the stock and distribute the proceeds, or distribute :he stock in kind, to the estate. At the termination of the period the trustees were directed to dispose of the stock, either by a sale or a distribution in kind, and the proceeds of the sale or the stock itself was to be distributed to the residuary estate. In the event of the death prior to the termination of the trust of either of the named trustees, the power to appoint a successor trustee was given to the surviving trustee.\nSince tlie docket entries are confused we have taken the chronology of events from the appellee\u2019s brief.\nThe docket entries indicate the same persons filed exceptions to the account of February 14, 1955. However, the printed record includes neither that account nor the exceptions thereto.\nExceptants claimed this credit was not listed in the inventory, on any tax schedules or in appellee\u2019s account of February 14, 1955.\nDocket entry reads as follows: \u201cNow, December 15, 1955, Confirmed finally as per Stipulation filed.\u201d\nAct of Aug. 10, 1951, P. L. 1163, Art. Ill, \u00a7301, as amended by Act of Aug. 4, 1955, P. L. 302, No. 116, \u00a71 and Act of Feb. 10, 1956, P. L. 1022, \u00a73, 20 PS Supp. \u00a72080.301 (13).\nQuery: If the statement of amicus curiae\u2019s counsel to the court below that appellee had \u201can option for the purchase of a l/3rd interest in 27 corporations\u201d and that he obtained this option by virtue of this stipulation be correct, then under the stipulation appellee obtained the option not in his individual but rather in his fiduciary capacity. Present counsel for amicus curiae appeared as one of appellee\u2019s counsel in the court below.\nThe use of the phrase \u201cnominee of Prank O. Walker\u201d poses several interesting questions. Why was that phrase used in connection with the sale of exceptants\u2019 interest in this estate and the phrase \u201ca designated corporation\u201d used in connection with the sale of exceptants\u2019 securities in the other' two estates? Was the nominee that of appellee in his individual or fiduciary capacity? Why was the nominee to be appellee\u2019s nominee in Paragraph 2 of the stipulation and the nominee under Paragraphs 6 and 8 to be appellee\u2019s and O\u2019Leary\u2019s nominee?\nWhile the Record lists these securities, no value thereof is given. 23 of the companies listed in Schedule A of the stipulation and 22 of the companies listed on Schedule B of the stipulation (Rec. 91a, 92a, 93a) appear approximately 6 months later in the articles of merger as owned, directly or indirectly, 1/3 by this estate, 1/3 by Penn State Realty, Inc. and 1/3 by appellee. Query: Did appellee own a 1/3 interest on the date of stipulation?\nThis distribution in kind was at appellee\u2019s risk: Fiduciaries Act of 1949, P. L. 512, \u00a7734, 20 PS 320: Free\u2019s Estate, 327 Pa. 362, 194 A. 492.\nFriday signed the stipulation as one of counsel for appellee and O\u2019Leary."}
