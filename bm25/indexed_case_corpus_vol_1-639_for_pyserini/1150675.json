{"id": "1150675", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nMay 22, 1933:\nThe question before us is: Does the preference granted by the Act of April 5, 1927, P. L. 106, amending section 1 of the Private Banking Act of 1911, P. L. 1060, to depositors in insolvent duly licensed state banks also extend to depositors in banks operating without the license required by the Act of 1911? This latter act provides that, with certain exceptions (which need not be referred to here), \u201cno individual, partnership, or unincorporated association shall hereafter engage, directly or indirectly, in the business of receiving deposits of money for safekeeping or for the purpose of transmission to another, or for any other purpose, without having first obtained from a board, consisting of the State Treasurer, the Secretary of the Commonwealth, the Commissioner of Banking,......a license to engage in such business.\u201d\nIn October, 1913, George K. Reilly and Sidney F. T. Brock entered into a partnership under the name of Reilly, Brock & Company to engage in the investment banking and brokerage business. They also carried on a deposit banking business. They did not comply with any of the provisions of the Act of 1911 and did not obtain the license required. Charles A. Reilly, a brother of one of the partners herein, opened an account with the partnership in 1913 which account was active during the partnership\u2019s entire existence. From 1913 to 1925 the bank accepted deposits, using the word \u201cbankers\u201d on their stationery, etc. After that date they ceased to use the word \u201cbankers\u201d although they continued to do a banking business.\nIn 1928 five corporations, all appellants herein, i. e., Central Properties Company, The Chancellor Company, Burlington Arcade Company, North American Building Corporation and Corporation Real Estate Company, opened deposit accounts with the partnership. These accounts remained active during the existence of the firm.\nReilly, Brock & Company owned 69,325 of the 315,000 shares of stock of the Central Properties Company. This firm owned all of the common stock of the other fottr corporations above mentioned. The banking partners were two of the eight directors of Central Properties Company; two of the six directors of the Burlington Arcade Company; two of the firm\u2019s employees were directors of the North American Building Corporation and of the Corporation Real Estate Company. Sidney E. T. Brock was treasurer and two employees were respectively vice-president and assistant treasurer of the Central Properties Company.\nOn October 24, 1930, Sidney P. T. Brock, sole surviving partner, executed a deed of assignment for the benefit of the creditors of the firm. On that date the firm had thirty-eight active deposit accounts and ten inactive accounts. Of the active accounts ten were those of members of the family of the partners; nine were accounts of personal servants or employees of the firm; and twelve were accounts of corporations or organizations with which either members or employees of the firm were associated. At the time of the assignment the six appellants had on deposit to their credit the following amounts:\nThe Chancellor Company.................... $16,363.64\nBurlington Arcade Company............... 14,539.32\nNorth American Building Corporation...... 33,134.87\nCorporation Real Estate Company:\nRegular Account..............$18,676.79\n\u201cThe Wellington\u201d Account .... 16,888.60\n- 35,565.39\nCentral Properties Company................ 162,864.45\nCharles A. Reilly.......................... 11,597.67\nOn or about May 22, 1931, J. Willison Smith, as Receiver of the following companies: The Chancellor Company, Burlington Arcade Company, North American Building Corporation, Corporation Real Estate Company, and Central Properties Company, filed with the assignees, C. S. W. Packard and C. S. Newhall, proofs of claim against Reilly, Brock & Company for the amounts set forth. At the same time Charles A. Reilly filed his individual proof of claim for $11,597.67. These sums were claimed not only to share in the distribution of the general assets, but also to have priority over general creditors in the distribution, under the Banking Act of 1911 as amended in 1927.\nOn November 25, 1931, the assignees filed their first account and petition for distribution. They denied preference to the claims presented by J. Willison Smith, Receiver. Exceptions were subsequently filed and these were dismissed in the adjudication of the court below. Exceptions to this adjudication were filed by the Receiver of the five above named companies. The claim of Charles A. Reilly for a preference was likewise denied by the assignees and by the court below.\nThe question before us depends upon the interpretation of the adjective \u201csuch,\u201d being the eighth word in the amendment of April 5,1927, which reads as follows: \u201cIn case of the insolvency of any such individual, partnership, or unincorporated association, acting as a private banker, the distribution of the money, funds, property, and assets (other than the proceeds from the said bond or securities deposited) of the individual, partnership, or unincorporated association, shall be made and preferred in the following order: First, To the payment of all depositors of the individual, partnership, or unincorporated association, whether the deposits be subject to immediate check, or only payable after specified notice, or at the expiration of a fixed period, whether or not such notice has been given or such period expired at the time of distribution.\u201d\n\u201cSuch\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary as meaning \u201cof that kind,\u201d and also as \u201chaving the particular quality or character specified.\u201d \u201cSuch\u201d as applied to an \u201cindividual, partnership/\u2019 etc., must be interpreted to mean the kind of individual or partnership most recently referred to -in the context.\nA careful reading of section 1 of the Act of 1911, P. L. 1060, with its amendment of 1927, P. L. 106, leaves one in no doubt concerning to whom and what \u201csuch\u201d refers. This section, while not actually divided by the legislature, logically and grammatically invites division into four subsections. The first subsection emphatically says: \u201cNo individual, partnership, or unincorporated association shall hereafter engage directly or indirectly, in the\u201d banking business without first obtaining a license to do so. Second, the next subsection prescribes what an \u201capplicant\u201d for a license must do and declares that \u201cthe board may, in its discretion, approve or disapprove the application.\u201d The word \u201capplicant\u201d is mentioned in this subsection at least fifteen times. The third subsection proceeds on the theory that the application has been granted and the applicant has then become a \u201clicensee.\u201d This latter word appears in the third subsection at least six times, and the word \u201clicense\u201d appears many more times, and once the following sentence is used in the third subsection: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person or partnership or unincorporated association holding such license certificate,\u201d etc. The fourth subsection includes the last part of section 1 of the Act of 1911 plus the amendment of 1927, which deals with the question of preference accorded to depositors. That part which was in the original Act of 1911 and is still retained, provides that \u201cthe money and securities deposited with the Commissioner of Banking\u201d by the licensee \u201cand the money which in case of default shall be paid on the\u201d licensee\u2019s bond \u201cby any applicant or the surety thereof, shall constitute a trust fund for the benefit of the depositors of the licensee,\u201d etc., \u201cand such beneficiaries shall be entitled to an absolute preference as to such moneys or securities over all general creditors of the licensee.\u201d It is then immediately provided that in the event of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the licensee, \u201csuch moneys and securities shall be delivered by the Commissioner of Banking, on the order or judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, to the assignee, receiver, or trustee of the licensee designated in such order or judgment.\u201d In the very next sentence (this being the first part of the amending Act of 1927), it is provided that \u201cin case of the insolvency of any such individual, partnership,\u201d etc., the depositors shall be given a preference, etc.\n\u201cSuch\u201d i. e., \u201cthat kind\u201d of individual, partnership, etc., as used in that sentence can mean only the individual, etc., who has been duly licensed as a private banker. If the word \u201csuch\u201d does not mean that, it has no place or purpose whatever in the act. If the sentence quoted means what appellants contend it means, the word \u201csuch\u201d is entirely superfluous and should be deleted so that the sentence would read: \u201cIn case of the insolvency of any individual,\u201d etc., \u201cacting as a private banker,\u201d etc. For us to delete a word from an act so as to give it a different meaning is for us to engage in legislation. The \u201capplicant\u201d mentioned in subsection 2 has been transformed into a \u201clicensed banker\u201d in subsection 3. Section 1 of the Act of 1927 is therefore concerned only with \u201csuch [i. e., a duly licensed] individual, partnership, or unincorporated association.\u201d It has no interest whatever in anyone who engages in the banking business without having been duly licensed. The amending Act of 1921, which relates only to section 1 of the Act of 1911, makes no reference whatever to any individual, partnership, etc., who or which engages in the banking business without a license. Section 1 of the Act of 1911 makes no reference whatever to an unlicensed banker except to \u201coutlaw\u201d him in the first ten lines of the act. When the Act of 1911 next refers to an unlicensed banker it is in s\u00e9ction 3, where he is given the status of a misdemeanant and his punishment provided for.\nTo interpret, as appellants would have us do, the phrase \u201csuch individual, partnership,\u201d etc., as meaning any individual, or partnership, etc., who or which engages in the business of banking whether licensed or ^licensed, is to affront both grammar and public policy. \u201cA purpose to disregard sound public policy must not be attributed to the law-making power, except upon the most cogent evidence\u201d: 25 R. C. L. page 1041, section 272, 5 L. R. A. 340. \u201cThat construction [is] favored which will render every word operative rather than one which makes some words idle and negative\u201d: 25 R. C. L., page 1008, section 247; Com. v. Duane, 1 Bin. 601.\nUnless the language of the Act of 1927 clearly demands it, the judiciary will not interpret it as giving to depositors in private banks which operate in defiance of a legislative mandate, the preference accorded to depositors in banks duly licensed by the Commonwealth, after the most careful scrutiny of the applicant\u2019s assets and liabilities, his citizenship in Pennsylvania, and after the applicant has filed a bond with adequate surety or sureties, or, in lieu thereof, has deposited money or government bonds or other approved securities. Such an interpretation would encourage the very practice the law condemns by relieving \u201coutlaw\u201d bankers of the necessity of making application, filing a bond and depositing securities, and would thereby accord bankers who flout and evade the law a preference over those who respect it and abide by it. Any interpretation of the Act of 1927 that leads to such an anomalous result would have to be based on equally anomalous grammar.\nThe presence of the parenthetical phrase \u201cother than the proceeds from the said bond or securities deposited\u201d in the section under interpretation leaves \u2014 if doubt had not already been excluded by a perusal of the act \u2014 not the slightest room for uncertainty as to the meaning of the adjective \u201csuch\u201d in the amendment of 1927. The only bond or securities deposited would be those of a duly licensed banker, for the filing of an approved bond or the deposit of approved securities are prerequisites to the granting of a banker\u2019s license.\nThe decree is affirmed; costs to be paid by the appellant in case No. 186, January Term, 1933, and by the appellants in cases Nos. 199 to 203, inclusive, January Term, 1933."}
