{"id": "1760989", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nPursuant to the \u201cUniform Declaratory Judgment Act,\u201d Act of June 18, 1923, P.L. 840, \u00a7 1, as amended, 12 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 831 et seq., a group of owners of realty and taxpayers of Allegheny County filed actions in the Court of Common Pleas seeking a declaratory judgment determining the applicability to Allegheny County of Act 100, a 1976 amendment to section 402 of the General County Assessment Law [hereinafter: Act 100] which requires completion of a countywide revised assessment of real property before taxes may be levied on any revised assessment of real property located therein \u201c[e]xcept in counties of the first class.\u201d The actions were consolidated for hearing, and later the Court of Common Pleas, per a judge from another judicial district specially presiding, entered an adjudication and order declaring that Act 100 applies to Allegheny County and precluding the levying of taxes for the years 1977, 1978 and 1979 based on a 1976 revised assessment of real property in the northern triennial assessment district of Allegheny County until the assessment of real property in the entire county was completed. Appeals were filed in the Commonwealth Court and, subsequently, that court entered an unanimous order and opinion reversing the order of the Court of Common Pleas. Because the issue is one of first impression and of great importance, this Court granted allocatur.\nAllegheny County is a county of the second class. Authority for triennial district assessments of real property in counties of the second class is contained in provisions of two statutes, viz., the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-401(b), and the Second Class County Assessment Law, Act of June 21, 1939, P.L. 626, \u00a7 7, as amended, Act of November 9, 1965, P.L. 668, \u00a7 1, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5452.7 [hereinafter: Second Class County Assessment Law]. In accordance with section 5452.7, the Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review divided Allegheny County, a county of the second class, into three districts: (1) the northern district; (2) the city of Pittsburgh; and, (3) the southern district. The Board authorized assessments to be made each year in one of the districts to be effective for a triennium.\nPrior to June 24, 1976, section 402 of the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-402, provided standards for the valuation of property in counties utilizing the triennial method of assessment. On June 24, 1976, the legislature amended section 402 to read as follows:\n\u201c(a) It shall be the duty of the several elected and appointed assessors, and, in townships of the first class, of the assessors, assistant township assessors and assistant triennial assessors, to assess, rate and value all objects of taxation, whether for county, city, township, town, school, institution district, poor or borough purposes, according to the actual value thereof, and at such rates and prices for which the same would separately bona fide sell. In arriving at such value the price at which any property may actually have been sold shall be considered but shall not be controlling. Instead such selling price, estimated or actual, shall be subject to revision by increase or decrease to accomplish equalization with other similar property within the taxing district. Except in counties of the first class, no political subdivision shall levy real estate taxes on a county-wide revised assessment of real property until it has been completed for the entire county.\u201d [Emphasis added to indicate Act 100, the 1976 amendment]\nDuring 1976, real property in the northern district of Allegheny County was assessed in accordance with the previously established schedule for making triennial district assessments. On June 17, 1977, acting pursuant to the Second Class County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5452.17a, the assessments, as revised in 1976 for the northern district, were certified to the political subdivisions of Allegheny County for their use in levying taxes for the calendar years 1977, 1978 and 1979. In 1977, taxes on real property located in the northern district were levied on the basis of the 1976 revised assessments. The other two districts were taxed in 1977 on the basis of assessments determined in 1975 and 1974. Thereafter, appellants instituted these actions claiming section 402 of the General County Assessment Law was violated by tax levies made in 1977 on increased assessments of property in the northern district. As noted before, the trial court agreed with the appellants; however, the Commonwealth Court did not. We conclude the Commonwealth Court is correct.\nAllegheny County is the only county now authorized by statute to assess property on a district-wide, triennial assessment basis. All other counties, including counties of the first class, are required to assess property on\u00b0 an annual basis. Although first class and third class counties are required by statute to divide such counties into assessment districts, see Act of June 27, 1939, P.L. 1199, \u00a7 5, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5341.5 and Act of June 26, 1931, P.L. 1379, \u00a7 4, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5345, respectively, these and all other counties, except second class counties, are required to make annual assessments. Therefore, all counties, except Allegheny County, in effect, assess property county-wide on an annual basis.\nAct 100, by its terms, applies to county-wide reassessments. It directs that taxes may only be levied on such assessments when the assessments have been completed for the entire county. By its terms, Act 100 applies to all counties except \u201ccounties of the first class.\u201d The Commonwealth Court did not consider this introductory phrase when it held that Act 100 did not apply to Allegheny County. See Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(b) (Supp.1978-79). However, even after considering this introductory phrase, we hold that Act 100 does not apply to Allegheny County because Allegheny County is permitted to employ a district-wide, triennial assessment system.\nInitially, we are supported in this conclusion because to apply Act 100 to Allegheny County, under the district-wide, triennial assessment system, would lead to a result not intended by the legislature. In ascertaining the intent of the General Assembly, we are to presume that it does not intend a result that \u201cis absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable.\u201d Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 1922(1) (Supp.1978-79). Yet, the application of Act 100 to a county using a triennial, district-wide assessment system would result in an unequal tax burden on property owners within the county in any given year. Under Act 100, taxes could not be levied on assessments made in the first district in year one until assessments were completed for the other two districts in Allegheny County in years two and three. Under the existing unstable economic climate and increasing inflation, this would produce a grossly unfair situation. Property owners in the first district assessed in year one would pay taxes based on that assessment only after assessments had been made on increased real estate values in the other two districts in Allegheny County in years two and three. Thus, property owners assessed in year one would pay taxes on assessments based on earlier and lower real estate values for three years, while those assessed in years two and three would pay taxes on assessments based on higher real estate values for three years, respectively. This result is clearly unreasonable.\nOur conclusion is further supported by the resolution of an inconsistency between the General County Assessment Law and the Second Class County Assessment Law. Section 105 of the General County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020.105 provides in pertinent part:\n\u201cAll local acts of Assembly applying to particular counties or political subdivisions thereof, and not heretofore repealed, shall continue in force, and any provisions of this act inconsistent therewith shall not apply to the counties or political subdivisions thereof affected by such local laws. .\n\u201cWhenever the provisions of this act are inconsistent with any law relating to or administered by any board of revision of taxes, or board for the assessment and revision of taxes, in counties of the first, second or third class, the laws relating to and administered by such boards, and not included in this act, shall apply, and the inconsistent provisions of this act shall not apply to such classes of counties, but shall be in full force as to all other classes of counties, except as affected by local laws.\u201d\nThus, a provision of the Second Class County Assessment Law supersedes an inconsistent provision of the General County Assessment Law.\nAs noted earlier, sections 7 and 10 of the Second Class County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5452.7 and 5452.10 permit Allegheny County, through its Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review, to divide the county into three districts and make assessments in one of such districts each year, effective for the next triennium. Other sections of the Second Class County Assessment Law provide for giving notice of the new district-wide assessments, a right of appeal and finally the certification of the revised assessment to political subdivisions. Second Class County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5452.10, 5452.11, 5452.16 and 5452.17a. The Commonwealth Court held that:\n\u201cAct No. 100 as applied by the court below would prohibit the certification of revised assessments for any single District and would require that all three Districts be certified two years later. This is clearly inconsistent with the practice allowed by the \u2018Second Class County Assessment Law.\u2019 \u201d\nMcKinney v. Board of Commissioners, 35 Pa.Cmwlth. 91, 99, 385 A.2d 596, 600 (1978). We agree; however, we wish to make clear that Act 100 is only inconsistent with the Second Class County Assessment Law so long as Allegheny County employs a district-wide, triennial assessment system. Section 7 of the Second Class County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5452.7 permits, but does not mandate, the use of district-wide, triennial assessments. It states that: \u201c[t]he board may divide the county into three districts . . . and may provide that triennial assessments shall be made each year, but for only one of such three districts during any one year.\u201d [Emphasis added.]\nFurthermore, whenever general and specific provisions are in conflict, the provisions should be construed, if possible, to give effect to both. Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1933 (Supp.1978-79). Instantly, Act 100 is only inconsistent when Allegheny County, a second class county, permissively employs a district-wide, triennial assessment system. Act 100 can properly be applied to second class counties which do not employ such a system. Thus, should Allegheny County stop using district-wide, triennial assessments, Act 100 could, thereafter, be properly applied.\nOrder affirmed.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\nThis case was reassigned to the writer on November 16, 1979.\n. Act of May 22, 1933, P.L. 853, art IV, \u00a7 402, as amended, Act of June 24, 1976, P.L. 422, No. 100, \u00a7 1, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-402(a) (Supp. 1979-80) [hereinafter: General County Assessment Law].\n. The taxpayers also filed a class action in equity related to the actions in declaratory judgment seeking to enjoin the taxing authorities from collecting taxes on a 1976 revised assessment of real property in the northern triennial assessment district of Allegheny County for the years 1977, 1978 and 1979, and to have refunded to them taxes collected on these revised assessments. See McKinney v. Allegheny County, No. G.D. 77-2104 (Com. Pleas August 25, 1977).\n. The taxpayers filed two motions to quash the appeals filed in the Commonwealth Court which were denied. The motions maintained that: (1) the issue was moot since the Allegheny County Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review has, since the commencement of the action, discontinued the triennial assessment by district method; and, (2) the appeals were premature.\nIn denying the motions to quash, Judge Rogers said:\n\u201cThe petitioners below have filed two motions to quash the appeal, both of which we conclude are without merit. One motion says the matter in controversy is moot because the County Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review, has, since this case began, taken action to abandon the triennial assessment by district method of assessment which was centrally questioned in this litigation. The matter is clearly far from moot since, as we have just observed, substantial refunds of taxes will be required to be made in upwards of 65 municipalities, not to mention the county. Further, the Board of Property Assessment may decide to reinstitute the triennial assessment by district method, if it should be held not to have been affected by the amendment relied on by the petitioners below. The petitioners\u2019 other motion to quash asserts that this appeal is interlocutory because an equity action involving the same legal issue but asking different relief was consolidated with this case for disposition below and was not finally disposed of by the court below. The judgment entered below in this declaratory judgment case was clearly final. Actions, although consolidated for trial, retain their separate identity. See Goodrich-Amram Procedural Rules Service \u00a7 213(a)-13. The motions to quash will be dismissed.\u201d [Footnote omitted.]\nMcKinney v. Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, 35 Pa.Cmwlth. 91, 93-94, 385 A.2d 596, 597 (1978). We agree the motions were properly denied.\n. The counties of the Commonwealth are divided into nine classes, according to population. Allegheny is currently the only county of the second class.\n. Authority for triennial assessments in counties of the second and third through eighth class is found in section 401(c), (d), and (e) of the General County Assessment Law. The General County Assessment Law authorizes only annual assessments for counties of the first class. Section 401(a).\n. Section 5452.7 provides as follows:\n\u201cThe board may divide the county into three districts, as nearly equal as possible in subjects of taxation, and may provide that triennial assessments shall be made each year, but for only one of such three districts during any one year. In order to inaugurate such system, a triennial assessment may be made for the first district during the year immediately following one in which a triennial assessment was made for the county as a whole, and a triennial assessment may be made for the second district during the second year following one in which a triennial assessment was made for the county as a whole. Whenever the board has divided the county into districts and provided for triennial assessments in each of such triennial districts as herein set forth, the board, in making and supervising assessments and valuations of property in such triennial districts shall make such assessments and valuations at a level uniform within such triennial districts but not in excess of the actual market value of any property assessed and valued and such assessments shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirements of uniformity of taxation on the same class of subjects.\u201d\n. Although the General County Assessment Law authorized triennial assessments for all counties other than those of the first class, see 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-401, the making of triennial assessments was abolished for counties of the third class by the Act of May 26, 1949, P.L. 1848, \u00a7 1, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5344 and for counties of the fourth to eighth class by the Act of May 21, 1943, P.L. 571, art. VI, \u00a7 601, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5453.601.\n. Counties of the first class are required to make annual assessments. Philadelphia County is now the only first class county. Act of June 27, 1939, P.L. 1199, \u00a7 7, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5341.7.\n. See n. 7 and n. 8, supra.\n. The Second Class County Assessment Law, 72 P.S. \u00a7 5452.10 provides that the revised assessment \u201cshall stand as the valuations for the assessments of all county and institution district taxes and for such other political subdivisions as levy their taxes on county assessments and valuations in the county, until the next triennial assessment . . . .\u201d"}
