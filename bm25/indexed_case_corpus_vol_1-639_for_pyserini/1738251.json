{"id": "1738251", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nOn November 19, 1974, a jury found appellant William Russell guilty of murder of the first degree, aggravated robbery, burglary, and conspiracy in connection with the shooting death of William Lackman and John Seely and robbery of the residence of Dr. Frank Washick. The trial court on October 21, 1975 denied appellant\u2019s post-verdict motions and sentenced appellant to life imprisonment on the murder conviction and both concurrent and consecutive sentences on the other convictions. Appellant contends that the trial court improperly instructed the jury that in evaluating the credibility of a witness who testifies favorably for the accused, but who was previously convicted and sentenced for the crime in question, the jury should view the exculpatory testimony \u201cwith disfavor because it comes from a corrupt and polluted source,\u201d should \u201caccept [the testimony] only with caution and care,\u201d and should consider whether the testimony is \u201csupported by independent evidence.\u201d We agree, reverse judgments of sentence, and grant appellant a new trial.\nI\nThe Commonwealth asserts that appellant, though not present during the commission of the crime, organized and planned it. Joseph Grissell testified for the Commonwealth that he was supposed to act as a lookout for the perpetrators, but withdrew from the enterprise. Grissell testified that he was present when appellant organized the crime. Adolph Schwartz, one of the perpetrators, testified for appellant that he did not know appellant and that appellant was not involved. Appellant also testified.\nThe trial court instructed the jury that in evaluating the testimony of Grissell, the prosecution\u2019s witness, it should be aware that an accomplice \u201cmay falsely blame others,\u201d and that his testimony should be examined closely. The court also charged that Grissell\u2019s testimony \u201cstanding alone is sufficient evidence on which to find the defendant guilty if, after following the foregoing principles [concerning accomplices], you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he testified truthfully. . . . \u201d\nThe court then charged the jury concerning the testimony of Schwartz, appellant\u2019s witness: \u201cNow as to him, you also have to apply the same precautions [as for Grissell] in determining the credibility of his testimony. Briefly, to repeat what I have said for the other accomplice, in deciding whether or not to believe Schwartz\u2019s testimony, you should be guided by the same principles.\u201d The trial court continued:\n\u201cThe testimony of Adolph Schwartz should be looked upon with disfavor because it comes from a corrupt and polluted source.\nTwo: You should examine his testimony closely and accept it only with caution and care, which is exactly the same thing I said for the other accomplice that testified.\nThird: You should consider whether Schwartz\u2019s testimony is supported in whole or in part by other evidence aside from his testimony, for if it is supported by independent evidence, then it is more dependable.\nAnd, finally, you may believe Schwartz\u2019s testimony even though it is not supported by any other evidence.\u201d\nII\nThe Commonwealth asserts that appellant failed to preserve the issue whether the trial court erred in instructing the jury concerning the testimony of Adolph Schwartz. We do not agree.\nThe jury returned its verdicts on November 19, 1974. Counsel for appellant on November 22, 1974, filed post-verdict motions challenging the sufficiency of the evidence. On November 25, appellant, though represented by trial counsel, filed timely pro se post-verdict motions challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury, the prosecuting attorney\u2019s closing argument, and the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury further on the credibility of the witnesses. On February 27, 1975, before argument on post-verdict motions, counsel withdrew from the case with the approval of appellant, and new counsel entered an appearance. New counsel filed a brief addressing the charge. After argument, the court denied the motions, including the objection to the charge concerning Schwartz\u2019s testimony.\nCiting Commonwealth v. Bell, 442 Pa. 566, 276 A.2d 834 (1971), the Commonwealth argues that motions filed by a counseled defendant, such as the November 25 post-verdict motions of appellant, are not valid. In Bell, this Court pointed out the importance of defense counsel and stated \u201ca hearing or trial court should not accept an accused\u2019s pro se motion when he has counsel of record and there is no evidence he has discussed the matter with counsel, particularly where the motion works to the accused\u2019s prejudice.\u201d Id. 442 Pa. at 571, 276 A.2d at 836.\nThe Commonwealth misperceives Bell. Bell does not hold that such pro se motions by a counseled defendant are per se invalid. Rather, Bell directs trial courts to scrutinize such motions so that undue procedural confusion might be avoided. Where appellant has taken steps necessary to preserve his right to appellate review of an alleged error, and where these steps do not prejudice appellant, we cannot say that the trial court erred in treating appellant\u2019s timely pro se motions as a proper supplement to those post-verdict motions already filed.\nIll\nGiving an \u201caccomplice charge\u201d when an accomplice testifies on behalf of the prosecution is a well-established practice. See Commonwealth v. Sisak, 436 Pa. 262, 259 A.2d 428 (1969); see also Cool v. United States, 409 U.S. 100, 103, 93 S.Ct. 354, 357, 34 L.Ed.2d 335 (1972) (citing cases). Giving such a charge when the witness testifies for the defendant, however, is far less common. There are few reported appellate cases from other jurisdictions directly passing on this issue, which is apparently one of first impression for this Court.\nA legitimate basis exists for charging the jury to view an accomplice\u2019s testimony with suspicion when the accomplice testifies for the Commonwealth. Such a witness, out of a reasonable expectation of leniency, has an interest in inculpating others. This basis is inapplicable, however, when the accomplice testifies on behalf of the defense. One implicated in a crime cannot reasonably expect such leniency by exonerating others, particularly where, as here, the witness has already been sentenced for committing the crime. Thus, it is unreasonable to infer, and improper for the court to charge, that because this defense witness stood convicted of the crime in question, his testimony must be viewed \u201cwith disfavor\u201d and accepted only with \u201ccaution and care.\u201d\nWe cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. See Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 383 A.2d 155 (1978). The prosecution\u2019s case rested heavily on the testimony of the alleged confederate Grissell. The defense consisted of testimony of the convicted perpetrator Schwartz and appellant, both of whom contradicted Grissell. Credibility of these witnesses was crucial. Therefore, appellant was prejudiced by a charge misdirecting the jury in assessing the testimony of Schwartz, an important defense witness. See Commonwealth v. Jackson, 475 Pa. 604, 381 A.2d 438 (1977); Commonwealth v. Reese, 475 Pa. 120, 379 A.2d 1312 (1977).\nJudgments of sentence reversed and new trial granted.\nJONES, former C. J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. This Court reversed appellant\u2019s previous conviction on these charges. Commonwealth v. Russell, 456 Pa. 559, 322 A.2d 127 (1974).\n. We hear these appeals pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, arts. II and V, \u00a7\u00a7 202(1) and 503(a), 17 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 211.202(1) and 211.503(a) (Supp.1977).\n. Appellant asserts that the evidence was insufficient to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and drawing all reasonable inferences favorable to the Commonwealth, see Commonwealth v. Kichline, 468 Pa. 265, 361 A.2d 282 (1976); Commonwealth v. Bastone, 466 Pa. 548, 353 A.2d 827 (1976), we conclude that the evidence was sufficient.\nAppellant also contends that the trial court erred by: (1) instructing the jury that before it could apply the \u201caccomplice rule\u201d to the testimony of a prosecution witness it must first find that the witness had not withdrawn from the conspiracy; and (2) failing to emphasize to the jury that it could return a verdict of murder of the second degree. Our disposition makes resolution of these issues unnecessary.\n. The Commonwealth also asserts that appellant\u2019s pro se motions referred generally to the charge of the tried court, but not to the \u201cpolluted source\u201d charge. A fair reading of appellant\u2019s pro se motion, however, see Commonwealth ex rel. Saunders v. Creamer, 464 Pa. 2, 345 A.2d 702 (1975), citing Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), and new counsel\u2019s post-verdict brief, filed before argument, put the court on notice of appellant\u2019s allegation of error.\n. The Supreme Court of New Jersey has held invalid an accomplice charge where the accomplice is a defense witness. State v. Gardner, 51 N.J. 444, 460-61, 242 A.2d 1, 10 (1968). Accord, Wheelis v. State, 340 So.2d 950, 952 (Fla.App.1976) (disapproving charge that accomplice testifying for defense must be evaluated with great caution; no Florida case approving such a charge); People v. Legear, 29 Ill.App.3d 884, 892, 331 N.E.2d 659, 665 (1975) (as a general rule, accomplice instruction should not be given where it derogates from defendant\u2019s ability to use favorable testimony); People v. Howard, 130 Ill.App.2d 496, 498, 263 N.E.2d 633, 634 (1970) (general rule is to give instruction only where accomplice implicates defendant) (citing cases). But see United States v. Nolte, 440 F.2d 1124 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 862, 92 S.Ct. 49, 30 L.Ed.2d 106 (1971) (upholding instruction; accomplice credibility may be suspect).\n. In Commonwealth v. Griffin, 216 Pa.Super. 410, 268 A.2d 129 (1970), the Superior Court held it was error to instruct a jury that it must believe an accomplice testifying for the defendant \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The Superior Court went on to say, however, that without the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d language the charge would be proper because the witness had admitted to prior felony convictions. This language, however, was not necessary to resolve the case; in any event, we decline to follow it."}
