{"id": "1926002", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThis is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Bedford County sustaining defendant-appellee\u2019s motion for a judgment on the pleadings as against plaintiff-appellant Roy E. Earns.\nThe pleadings disclose that appellant\u2019s children found an unexploded aerial bomb at the Bedford County Fair Grounds where, several weeks earlier, appellee had staged a fireworks display. Appellant\u2019s children brought him the device. Subsequent events are narrated in appellant\u2019s complaint as follows:\n\u201cAfter the children of the plaintiff gave the plaintiff the aerial bomb in question, the plaintiff, not knowing that the same was an unexploded firecracker and wishing to determine whether his children could safely play with the object in question, removed the top from the same and poured a part of the contents on the ground and attempted to ignite the contents. After the contents failed to ignite, the plaintiff, holding the' remainder of the contents of the bomb, in his hand, turned from the scene when suddenly the firecracker held in the plaintiff\u2019s hand, violently exploded . . . .\u201d The trial court ruled that appellant was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law. Unfortunately, the basis for this conclusion is never clearly articulated in the trial court\u2019s opinion. In the crucial paragraph of its discussion the trial court first summarized appellee\u2019s contentions as to what the pleadings demonstrated as follows:\n\u201c. . . Roy E. Earns, knowing that the object he had received from his child or children was an unexploded aerial bomb, and knowing or suspecting it was dangerous, nevertheless held it in his hand while he examined its contents and deliberately ignited it, thereby causing the injuries complained of to himself and his son.\u201d Immediately following this summary the trial court made several conclusory statements to the effect that appellant was contributorily negligent as a matter of law. It is not clear whether the trial court reached its conclusion as to appellant\u2019s contributory negligence on the basis of the facts as set forth in appellant\u2019s complaint or on the basis of the facts as outlined in its summary of appellee\u2019s \u201ccontentious.\u201d Whatever the case, we must reverse.\nIf, as seems likely, the trial court viewed the facts as set forth in its summary of appellee\u2019s contentions it clearly violated its obligation to consider the pleadings and the inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the appellant. \u201cUnder Pa. R. C. P. 1034, a motion for judgment on the pleadings may be granted in cases which are so free from doubt that a trial would clearly be a fruitless exercise. Such a motion is in the nature of a demurrer; all of the opposing party\u2019s well-pleaded allegations are viewed as true but only those facts specifically admitted by him may be considered against him.\u201d Bata v. Central-Penn National Bank of Philadelphia, 423 Pa. 373, 224 A. 2d 174 (1966). See also Bureau for Child Care v. United Fund of Philadelphia, 416 Pa. 617, 207 A. 2d 847 (1965); Poole v. Great American Ins. Co., 407 Pa. 652, 182 A. 2d 509 (1962). Read in the proper manner, the pleadings hardly establish that appellant was so clearly guilty of contributory negligence that appellee is entitled to a judgment on the pleadings. For example, it is not at all clear from the pleadings that appellant\u2019s attempt to fire that portion of the firecracker\u2019s contents which he poured out as a sample caused the remainder of the device to explode. Appellant\u2019s task might well seem difficult, but on the basis of these pleadings it is hardly impossible, and he deserves the chance to present his case.\nJudgment vacated and case remanded for further consistent proceedings."}
