Did the Commonwealth Court exceed its scope of review and invade the PUC\u2019s administrative discretion and role as fact-finder by ignoring substantial record evidence of the public benefits of the merger and improperly substituting its evidentiary conclusions and judgment for that of the PUC?\n2. Did the Commonwealth Court violate this Court\u2019s directives regarding the deference owed to the PUC\u2019s interpretation and application of 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103(a), as set forth in Elite Indus. v. Pennsylvania Public Util. Comm\u2019n, 574 Pa. 476, 832 A.2d 428 (2003)?\n3. Did the Commonwealth Court err in holding that, where a utility is not subject to rate-of-return regulation, merger cost savings cannot be considered a public benefit for purposes of 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1103 and that only an enforceable \u201ccommitment\u201d to offer services that \u201cwould not be offered in the absence of the merger\u201d can be considered a public benefit?"}
