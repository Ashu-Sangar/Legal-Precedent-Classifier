{"id": "1772974", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nKAUFFMAN, Justice.\nThe Commonwealth challenges an order of the Superior Court which reversed the judgment of sentence of appellee, Anthony Dominick Ciotti, for receiving stolen goods and remanded for a new trial. Commonwealth v. Ciotti, 279 Pa.Super. 75, 420 A.2d 751 (1980). The sole issue for review is whether appellee\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to one remark made by the court clerk during a poll of the jury.\nThe trial transcript reveals that, after the jury completed its deliberations and returned to the courtroom to report its verdict, the following occurred:\n\u201cCLERK OF COURTS: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict?\nTHE FOREMAN: We have.\n(The Clerk of Courts received the verdict from the foreman and showed it to the Judge.)\nCLERK OF COURTS: As to your verdict in the issue joined between the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the defendant, Anthony Ciotti, you say you find the defendant guilty, so say you all.\nTHE JURY: I do.\n[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: May we have a poll of the jury, your Honor?\nTHE COURT: All right. . ..\nCLERK OF COURTS: When I call your name, would you please stand and respond yes.\nTHE COURT: And remain standing until the jury is completely polled.\nCLERK OF COURTS: Jimmie Hooker. You said you find the defendant guilty?\nMR. HOOKER: I do.\nCLERK OF COURTS: Dan Locke, you say you find the defendant guilty?\nMR. LOCKE: I do.\nCLERK OF COURTS: Pearl Adams, you say you find the defendant guilty?\nMS. ADAMS: Yes, I do.\nCLERK OF COURTS: John Teliski, you say you find the defendant guilty?\nMR. TELISKI: Yes, I do.\nCLERK OF COURTS: Dolores Theiss, you say you find the defendant guilty?\nMS. THEISS: Yes.\nCLERK OF COURTS: Jeffrey Donikowski, you say you find the defendant guilty?\nMR. DONIKOWSKI: Yes.\n[Jurors Seven through Twelve similarly responded \u201cYes\u201d to the clerk\u2019s question, \u201c[Name of particular juror], you say you find the defendant guilty?.\u201d]\nTHE COURT: All right, members of the jury, you may be seated. I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your long deliberation. I know you certainly gave this every consideration, and I might add that I believe that your verdict was justified by the evidence, so you need have no qualms about that whatsoever.\u201d\nN.T. 408-412.\nThe court subsequently denied trial counsel\u2019s post-trial motions and sentenced appellee to 2J/2 to 5 years imprisonment. Appellee retained new counsel and filed an appeal from the judgment of sentence, alleging, inter alia, that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the court clerk\u2019s remark to the jury during the poll.\nThe Superior Court, concluding that trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness was apparent from the record, reversed the judgment of sentence and remanded for a new trial. Holding that the jurors could reasonably have concluded from the clerk\u2019s remark that they were expected to answer in the affirmative when asked if they found appellee guilty, the court concluded that \u201cthere could be no reasonable basis for counsel\u2019s failure to object to the court clerk\u2019s remarks.\u201d 279 Pa.Super. at 79, 420 A.2d at 752-53. This appeal by the Commonwealth followed. We granted allocatur, and now vacate the order of the Superior Court.\nIt is axiomatic that failure to raise a meritless claim cannot render counsel ineffective. Thus, in evaluating appellee\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we must first determine whether an objection to the clerk\u2019s remark would have been of arguable merit:\nThe initial factor which must be considered ... is whether the claim which post-trial counsel is charged with not pursuing had some reasonable basis.... It is only when the claim which was foregone was of arguable merit that we must make an inquiry into the basis for ... counsel\u2019s decision not to pursue the matter.\nCommonwealth v. Hubbard, 472 Pa. 259, 277-78, 372 A.2d 687, 695-96 (1977) (Emphasis supplied). Because we are convinced that the jurors here voluntarily and unequivocally assented to the verdict in direct response to a clear and unambiguous question individually submitted to each of them, an objection by trial counsel to the jury poll would have been manifestly futile. See Commonwealth v. Rice, 456 Pa. 90, 318 A.2d 705 (1974) (counsel will not be held ineffective for failing to perform a futile act).\nIt is, of course, true that the right of an accused to poll the jury provides a fundamental guarantee that each juror voluntarily has joined in the verdict as written and previously announced. Commonwealth v. Martin, 379 Pa. 587, 592-93, 109 A.2d 325, 325-26 (1954). The words used in the polling, however, are not necessarily determinative of the poll\u2019s validity. The court must also consider \u201c[t]he demeanor and appearance of the juror[s] as well as all of the surrounding circumstances\u201d to determine \u201cwhether their answers do clearly indicate the assent of their individual minds.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Ryan v. Banmiller, 400 Pa. 326, 331, 162 A.2d 354, 356 (1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 852, 81 S.Ct. 99, 5 L.Ed.2d 76 (1960).\nIn the present case, the total circumstances of the polling resolve all doubts as to the jurors\u2019 voluntary assent to the verdict, and render the results of the poll unimpeachable. Indeed, the jurors\u2019 actual answers refute appellee\u2019s contention that they mistakenly believed that they were being instructed to voice a perfunctory \u201cyes\u201d response. Although the clerk did initially misspeak, \u201cWhen I call your name, please stand and respond yes,\u201d this remark must be read in context. Each of the jurors was thereafter individually asked whether he or she found the defendant guilty. The first two responded \u201cI do,\u201d rather than \u201cYes.\u201d Similarly, jurors Three and Four responded \u201cYes, I do.\u201d Although the final eight jurors simply responded \u201cYes\u201d, their reply was directly to the clerk\u2019s plain and simple question, \u201c[Name of particular juror], you say you find the defendant guilty?.\u201d Thus, none of the responses was a perfunctory \u201cyes\u201d even arguably resulting from a belief that the clerk\u2019s instruction had prohibited any other response.\nMoreover, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury emphasized each juror\u2019s duty to reach a verdict based solely on the trial testimony:\nNow, your verdict, this being a criminal case, your verdict must be unanimous. In other words, all twelve of you jurors must concur and agree upon the verdict that you reach. Any verdict returned that did not have the unanimous consent and approval of all of you would not be a proper verdict, would not be accepted by this Court.\n. . . Now, members of the jury, I join with both counsel in asking you to uphold your oath as good jurors to decide the case solely and alone upon the testimony produced here on the witness stand leaving any impression that you may have reached outside the courtroom aside, leaving any passion or prejudice or bias or sympathy behind you. Assess and evaluate the testimony and reach your decision solely upon that basis.\nN.T. 393-94 (Emphasis supplied). As Judge Van der Voort cogently stated in his dissent below, \u201cRead in context with the instructions given by the trial judge prior to sending the jury out to deliberate, [the] manner of interrogation by the Clerk becomes trivial. . . . \u201d Commonwealth v. Ciotti, 279 Pa.Super. at 81, 420 A.2d at 754. See also Commonwealth v. Parks, 273 Pa.Super. 506, 522, 417 A.2d 1163, 1171 (1979) (trial court\u2019s cautionary instruction to the jury was a proper fact in evaluating the validity of the jury poll).\nWe are here confronted with the following undisputed facts: (1) the trial judge specifically instructed the jury that their verdict must be unanimous and based solely on the testimony adduced at trial; (2) the written verdict was read in open court and assented to by the jury as a group; (3) each juror thereafter was asked individually if he or she found the defendant guilty; and (4) both trial counsel and the trial judge were satisfied that each juror had voluntarily assented to the verdict. Under the totality of the circumstances, any possibility that the clerk\u2019s remark resulted either in confusion or intimidation was so remote that an objection to the jury poll would have bordered on the frivolous. We therefore conclude that the jury poll clearly served its purpose and that counsel\u2019s failure to object was not ineffective.\nAccordingly, we vacate the order of the Superior Court and remand for disposition of the remaining issues raised by appellee.\nROBERTS, J., concurs in the result.\nLARSEN, J., notes a dissent and would affirm the order of the Superior Court.\n. Appellee argues that the clerk\u2019s instructions prohibited any response other than affirmance of the verdict.\n. Because its reversal was grounded solely on trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, the Superior Court found it unnecessary to reach appellee\u2019s additional contentions that the trial court erred in (1) refusing to give an accomplice instruction to the jury, and (2) limiting the cross-examination of a Commonwealth witness. Commonwealth v. Ciotti, supra, 279 Pa.Super. at 77 n.1, 420 A.2d at 752 n.l.\n. Jurisdiction is vested in this Court pursuant to the Judicial Code, Act of July 9, 1976, P.L. .586, No. 142, \u00a7 2, as amended, Act of Oct. 5, 1980, P.L. 693, No. 142, \u00a7 402(a), 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 724(a).\n. The purpose of a jury poll is to provide any juror the opportunity to declare that he or she did not voluntarily join in the verdict as announced. Id, 400 at 328, 162 A.2d at 355.\n. In Commonwealth ex rel. Ryan v. Banmiller, supra, we rejected a challenge to the jury poll grounded on the contention that two jurors read their answers from the verdict slip, and one was actually instructed by the trial judge to read, \u201ctjjust the lower part.\u201d Considering all the surrounding circumstances, we affirmed the conclusion that the jurors had adequately manifested their individual assent to the verdict."}
