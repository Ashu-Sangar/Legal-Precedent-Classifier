{"id": "12280210", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice DOUGHERTY.\nAppellant Thomas Lutz-Morrison presents an issue similar to the issue posed in A.S. v. Pa. State Police, 636 Pa. 403, 143 A.3d 896, 2016 WL 4273568 (2016), also decided today. A.S. involved the proper construction of the lifetime-registration triggering language \u201ctwo or more convictions\u201d in Megan\u2019s Law II, Pennsylvania\u2019s former sex offender registration statute. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(b)(1) (superseded). This appeal concerns nearly identical triggering language brought over into Section 9799.14 of Pennsylvania\u2019s current statute, Act 111 of 2011, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9799.10-9799.41. Our holding here follows from A.S. and, as explained below, we reverse and remand.\nMegan\u2019s Law II included a two-tier system for those offenders subject to its registration requirement. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.1(a), (b) (superseded). The history and background of SORNA has been detailed in other cases. See, e.g., In re J.B., 630 Pa. 408, 107 A.3d 1, 3-9 (2014). For our purposes it is enough to reiterate SORNA \u201cadded crimes to the list defined as sexually violent offenses, and established a three-tiered system for classifying such offenses and their corresponding registration periods.\u201d Commonwealth v. Farabaugh, 634 Pa. 16,128 A.3d 1191, 1192 (2015). The tiers provide for registration periods of fifteen years (Tier I), twenty-five years (Tier II), or lifetime (Tier III), depending on the offense(s) and/or circumstances. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.15(a)(l)-(3).\nSection 9799.14 of SORNA, as relevant here, provides:\n(a) Tier system established. \u2014 Sexual offenses shall be classified in a three-tiered system composed of Tier I sexual offenses, Tier II sexual offenses and Tier III sexual offenses.\n(b) Tier I sexual offenses. \u2014 The following offenses shall be classified as Tier I sexual offenses:\n(9)18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6812(d) (relating to sexual abuse of children),\n(c) Tier II sexual offenses. \u2014 The following offenses shall be classified as Tier II sexual offenses:\n(d) Tier III sexual offenses. \u2014 The following offenses shall be classified as Tier III sexual offenses:\n(1) 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2901(a.l) (relating to kidnapping).\n(2) 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8121 (relating to rape).\n(3) 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3122.1(b) (relating to statutory sexual assault).\n(4) 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3123 (relating to involuntary deviate sexual intercourse).\n(5) 18 Pa.C.S, \u00a7 3124.1 (relating to sexual assault).\n(6) 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3124.2(a.l).\n(7) 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3126 (relating to aggravated indecent assault).\n(8) 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3126(a)(7).\n(9) 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4302(b) (relating to incest).\n(10) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (relating to aggravated sexual abuse).\n(11) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242 (relating to sexual abuse).\n(12) 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 where the victim is under 13 years of age.\n(13) A comparable military offense or similar offense under the laws of another jurisdiction or country or under a former law of this Commonwealth.\n(14) An attempt, conspiracy or solicitation to commit an offense listed in paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12) or (13).\n(15) (Reserved).\n(16) Two or more convictions of offenses listed as Tier I or Tier II sexual offenses.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.14(a)~(d) (emphasis added).\nThe background of the underlying criminal prosecution is as follows. An investigation led police to secure a search warrant for a residence in Lancaster County, where appellant lived with his mother and brother. A March 2, 2012, search led to the seizure of four computers and an Apple iPhone 4. On the same day, appellant admitted to detectives he had downloaded child pornography files to his computer. An examination revealed 142 child pornography videos and 45 child pornography images on the computer along with 15 child pornography images on appellant\u2019s iPhone, Appellant was charged with 77 counts of sexual abuse of children (possession of child pornography). See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6812(d).\nOn August 16, 2013, the twenty-two-year-old appellant entered an open plea of guilty to three counts of possession of child pornography; the remaining charges were withdrawn by the Commonwealth. That same day, appellant was sentenced to consecutive one-year terms of probation on each count. The trial court also notified appellant his convictions subjected him to lifetime registration under SORNA as a Tier III offender. Appellant reserved an objection to that classification, averring the statute was ambiguous, and the only reason it arguably was triggered was because his plea encompassed more than one count.\nIn its Pa.R.A.P.1925(b) opinion, the trial court reasoned each count of possessing child pornography represented a Tier I sexual offense and conviction. Based on a plain reading of the statute and the Opinion in Support of Affirmance (OISA) in Commonwealth v. Gehris, 618 Pa. 104, 54 A.3d 862 (2012) (construing predecessor \u201ctwo or more convictions\u201d provision in Megan\u2019s Law), the court concluded the \u201ctwo or more convictions of offenses\u201d necessary to trigger lifetime registration may arise from the same criminal information. Thus, the court found appellant was a Tier III offender subject to lifetime reporting.\nOn appeal to the Superior Court, appellant claimed he should be classified as a Tier I offender because his multiple Tier I convictions arose from a single nonviolent course of conduct, and his plea occurred in a single hearing. The Superior Court affirmed in a memorandum opinion. The panel recognized this Court deadlocked 3-8 on a similar question in the Megan\u2019s Law context in Gehris, with an OISA by Justice Todd (joined by former Justices Eakin and McCaf-fery) and an Opinion in Support of Reversal (OISR) by former Chief Justice Castille (joined by Justices Saylor) (now Chief Justice) and Baer. After summarizing the competing Gehris opinions, the panel determined its own precedent in Commonwealth v. Merolla, 909 A.2d 337 (Pa.Super.2006), controlled. In the panel\u2019s view, nothing in SORNA\u2019s language warranted an interpretation differing from Merolla\u2019s construction of the similar language in Megan\u2019s Law. Accordingly, the panel held the plain language of SORNA required that appellant, who had three \u201cconvictions\u201d of Tier I offenses, be subject to lifetime registration. The panel was aware of the contrary holding of the Commonwealth Court iteration of AS. v. Pa. State Police, 87 A.3d 914 (Pa.Cmwlth.2014) (en banc), but declined to follow that decision given its obligation to follow its own precedent.\nThis Court granted review of the question whether appellant is properly subject to lifetime reporting under SOR-NA. The issue involves statutory interpretation and application, which presents a question of law; thus our review is plenary and non-deferential. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Conklin, 587 Pa. 140, 897 A.2d 1168, 1175 (2006).\nIn the course of their arguments, both parties recognize the \u201ctwo or more convictions\u201d language in SORNA was also present in Megan\u2019s Law and thus was subject to examination in cases like Gehris, Merolla, and AS. Thus, in addition to disputing whether the SORNA provision is ambiguous and whether it implicates \u201cthe recidivist philosophy,\u201d and forwarding supporting arguments implicating statutory construction, appellant invokes the Gehris OISR and A.S., while the Commonwealth relies upon Merolla.\nGiven the focus in the lower courts and the present briefing upon the Megan\u2019s Law cases, and the absence of any suggestion that anything in SORNA would lead to a different result on the question of the proper meaning of the term \u201ctwo or more convictions,\u201d resolution of this appeal is straightforward: it is effectively controlled by today\u2019s decision in A.S. , We will not repeat the AS. analysis at length here as appellant\u2019s case developed under similar circumstances: he was charged in a single information arising from the search of his property; he entered court as a first-time offender on those charges and pled guilty to three counts \u2014 all Tier I offenses; and there were no direct victims of his crimes, much less multiple direct victims. It is enough to note we hold that Section 9799.14, considered in the context of the statutory language as a whole, is susceptible to two reasonable constructions, and the statute, which sets forth a graduated (three-tier) scheme of registration, encompasses a recidivist philosophy. As such, the statute requires an act, a conviction, and a subsequent act to trigger lifetime registration for multiple offenses otherwise subject to a fifteen- or twenty-five-year period of registration.\nAccordingly, we reverse the order of the Superior Court and remand for imposition of a fifteen-year reporting requirement under SORNA.\nFormer Justice EAKIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this matter.\nChief Justice SAYLOR and Justices BAER and DONOHUE join the opinion.\nJustice TODD files a dissenting opinion.\nJustice WECHT files a dissenting opinion.\n. Section 6312 is entitled \"Sexual abuse of children.\u201d Subsection (d) provides:\n(d) Child pornography. \u2014 Any person who intentionally views or knowingly possesses or controls any book, magazine, pamphlet, slide, photograph, film, videotape, computer depiction or other material depicting a child under the age of 18 years engaging in a prohibited sexual act or in the simulation of such act commits an offense.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6312(d).\n. We are aware of a textual distinction between the two statutory regimes. Under the two-tier system of Megan\u2019s Law, lifetime registration was required for \u201c[a]n individual with two or more convictions of any of the offenses set forth in subsection (a),\u201d i.e., for offenses otherwise subject to ten-year registration. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795,l(a)-(b) (superseded) (emphasis added). Under SORNA\u2019s three-tier system, lifetime registration is required for offenders with \u201ctwo or more convictions of offenses listed as Tier I or Tier II sexual offenses,\u201d i.e., for offenses otherwise subject to fifteen-year or twenty-five-year registration. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.14(d). No argument is forwarded in the briefs premised upon the General Assembly\u2019s deletion of the words \"any of the\u201d in SORNA.\n. Appellant\u2019s brief was prepared by private counsel. On the eve of argument, however, the Defender Association of Philadelphia, which was not appointed and which had not filed a brief as amicus curiae, entered an appearance as counsel for appellant and an assistant defender presented oral argument. Counsel\u2019s oral presentation included several sophisticated arguments not pursued in appellant\u2019s brief, including, inter alia, a claim of ambiguity premised upon the textual differences between Megan\u2019s Law and SORNA; a claim the statute is subject to strict construction because, in other circumstances not present here, it applies retroactively, see 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(b)(2) (retroactive provisions \"shall be strictly construed\u201d); and a claim that \"sequential prosecutions\u201d should be required to trigger the recidivist provision. These claims were not outlined or developed in appellant\u2019s brief. In addition, it appears the Commonwealth, like the Court, was not provided a written exposition of the new theories and points presented at oral argument. Under the circumstances, for purposes of decision, we will confine ourselves to the arguments outlined in the briefs.\n. We do not dispute the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that each image of child pornography possessed represents a separate, independent crime, see Appellee\u2019s Brief at 12-13, citing Commonwealth v. Davidson, 595 Pa. 1, 938 A.2d 198, 219 (2007) (\"Each use of a minor to create a visual depiction of child pornography constitutes a separate and distinct abuse of that child, and thus represents an individual violation of the statute.\u201d), and appellant in fact was convicted and sentenced for his multiple crimes. But, for reasons explained in A.S., we view the SORNA registration question as distinct and deem it controlled by the recidivist philosophy animating this tiered scheme."}
