{"id": "1220299", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the refusal of the court below to grant a new trial.\nThe plaintiff, a minor aged thirteen years at the time of his injury, brought by his guardian an action in trespass against the defendant. The defendant is a corporation which owns and operates a roller skating rink in Philadelphia. While the plaintiff was skating in the defendant\u2019s rink another patron, who was also skating in the rink, came into violent collision with the plaintiff, causing him to be thrown to the floor and to be injured seriously. The negligence alleged is that \u201cthe defendant permitted a patron, who was disorderly and visibly intoxicated, to use and skate upon the rink of the defendant and the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care under the circumstances and that the defendant knew or should have known of the condition of that patron\u201d, as he \u201cwas upon the premises for some time prior to the accident and defendant knew or should have known of his presence\u201d. Plaintiff arrived at defendant\u2019s rink at 7:30 o\u2019clock on the evening of June 20,1941, and he paid 46 cents as his admission charge. At about 8:15 P. M. he first saw the patron who later collided with him. At about 9:30 P. M. the patron \u201ccut across the floor . . . and he fell, and as he fell his skate hit plaintiff\u2019s foot and knocked plaintiff over.\u201d As a result of the fall, plaintiff\u2019s arm was broken in two or three places and he liad to have his arm put in a cast where it remained for seven weeks.\nVincent A. Catallo, a witness called by'the plaintiff, testified that he saw the patron about 7:30 P. M., and he described him as \u201cthe man that was intoxicated\u201d. He noticed that the patron\u2019s face was red and his eyes were bloodshot. \u201cHe was skating around, staggering, and he hit a man and a lady.\u201d He said \u201ctwo attendants rushed out and picked up the intoxicated man\u201d. Mary Campo testified that the patron \u201casked me if I would have a soda with him\u201d and \u201che smelled as if he had been drinking\u201d. She testified further that after she declined his invitation to \u201chave a soda\u201d he asked if she \u201cwould help him down the walk; he couldn\u2019t make it by himself.\u201d Shortly afterwards the patron fell \u201cheadlong into the grass\u201d. Next time she saw the patron was when the minor plaintiff was on the floor and the patron was \u201cright beside him\u201d. At the close of the case the trial judge directed the jury to bring in a verdict for the defendant. \u2019\nThis case presents a most unusual r\u00e9cord of interference by a trial judge with ah attorney who is trying to present his client\u2019s case. The trial judge was apparently determined that the plaintiff should not prove the averment that the patron who caused the injury was drunk, which alleged drunkenness was the basic issue in the case. After witness Catallo testified that the witness was intoxicated he was asked, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d The court sustained the objection to this question. Why a witness should not be permitted to tell how he \u201cknew\u201d of the condition in respect to sobriety of a person whose alleged intoxication was a f\u00e1ct in issue is incomprehensible to anyone familiar with trial procedure. Obviously, when a witness states a certain thing to be a fact he should be permitted to reveal the basis of his knowledge of it. A few seconds later the same witness was asked, \u201cWhom did you see there [on the floor] ?\u201d When the answer was, \u201cI saw an intoxicated man\u201d, the court said, \u201cI will withdraw a juror if this is kept up.\u201d What the trial judge apparently objected to having \u201ckept up\u201d was the evidence of the patron\u2019s intoxication. Later when the same witness testified, \u201cHe was skating around, staggering, and he hit a man and a lady, and the intoxicated man fell and the man that the lady was skating with helped pick her up, two attendants rushed out and picked up the intoxicated man,\u201d the court again threatened to \u201cwithdraw a juror\u201d. Why a juror should be withdrawn because a witness described the dangerous antics of a drunken patron whose actions are an important part of the basis of plaintiff\u2019s complaint is a mystery which a careful perusal of this record does not dispel.\nWhen another witness testified that the patron \u201csmelled as if he had been drinking\u201d the court commented \u201cNo\u201d. What justification the court had negativing this witness\u2019s testimony does not appear. A moment later the court objected to the witness saying, \u201cThis man smelled of liquor\u201d and ordered the answer stricken out. A little later the same witness testified that the patron couldn\u2019t walk down the walk; \u201che couldn\u2019t make it by himself\u201d, and when she was asked \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t he?\u201d, the court refused to permit her to answer this very pertinent question. Later when the witness was asked this question: \u201cThe man you helped down the walk was lying alongside of Johnny?\u201d and she replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d the court ordered the answer stricken out, in spite of the obvious propriety of the witness\u2019s identification of the drunken patron as the man whom she helped down the walk. The question was then put to this witness in another way and the court refused to let the witness answer. Later the witness was asked the question as to whether or not she smelled the patron\u2019s breath, and the trial judge refused to let her answer. Again the witness was asked this question: \u201cWhat did you observe of his [the patron\u2019s] condition when you took him down the walk?\u201d- She answered, \u201cHe had been drinking and couldn\u2019t very well walk a straight line himself.\u201d The court ordered that answer stricken out.\nSuch judicial conduct as this record thus discloses merits and receives the condemnation of any person who has any regard for justice and for that \u201cdue process of law\u201d by which the cause of justice is served. That the trial judge disdainfully flouted the facts is evident in the opinion written by him in which he said, after stating that the defendant owed its patrons the duty of ordinary care, \u201cWe find no evidence in the record to support the conclusion that it failed in this regard. The plaintiff\u2019s witnesses observed no objectionable or unusual conduct on the part of anyone.\u201d These last two sentences belie this record. Nothing could be clearer than the fact that the patron complained of was drunk and that he was a menace to all the other patrons in the place and that he was there for a sufficient time for the defendant to be charged with knowledge of the fact, for two attendants of the defendant corporation rushed out and picked him up. It was the defendant\u2019s duty to eject promptly from its place of public entertainment a man in the drunken and dangerous condition of this patron, and it is answerable in damages for its failure to do so.\nIt is axiomatic that \u201cthe first and most essential element in a jury trial is a wise, learned, impartial and competent judge\u201d. A litigant who is denied this \u201cessential element\u201d is deprived of that \u201cdue process of law\u201d which in this country he is entitled to. This plaintiff\u2019s cause of action was not litigated according to our established standards of due legal process. He is therefore entitled to a new trial.\nThe judgment is reversed with a venire.\nMr. Justice Linn and Mr. Justice Horace Stern concur in this result.\nQuoted from the address of Joseph H. Choate before the American Bar Association on August 18, 1898."}
