{"id": "1924361", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nThis appeal presents a narrow, although important, problem of will construction.\nRuth G. Braman [decedent], a Centre County resident, died testate on March 13, 1963, survived by a spinster sister, Mary Goddard, who subsequently died February 25, 1964. Decedent\u2019s will, executed February 23, 1961, gave a life interest in her entire residuary estate to her sister, Mary Goddard, and directed that, upon Mary Goddard\u2019s death, the residuary estate be distributed in a specified manner to certain historical, religious, education and charitable institutions and to three named friends.\nIn her will dated July 15, 1938, Miss Goddard gave to decedent \u201cor her estate\u201d her entire residuary estate. Miss Goddard having survived decedent, the question arose upon her death as to the manner of distribution of her residuary estate. The Orphans\u2019 Oourt of Centre County decided that decedent\u2019s estate was the proper distributee of that residuary estate. 4 Centre County L.J. 91 (1966). An appeal taken from that decree to our Court was discontinued by agreement of the parties.\nThe instant controversy is between Helen M. Harbeson, the sole heir at law and next of kin of both decedent and Miss Goddard, and the residuary legatees of the decedent. The crux of this controversy is whether Miss Goddard\u2019s assets are distributable under the will of decedent or whether they are distributable to Miss Goddard\u2019s heir at law and next of kin by way of intestacy.\nIn considering this appeal, we initially note that decedent, both at the time of the execution of her will and at the time of her death, had no interest whatsoever in Miss Goddard\u2019s assets or property. She simply had an expectancy that, if she survived her sister, she would receive the residuary estate. The bequest and devise of Miss Goddard\u2019s residuary estate was to go to decedent only in the event Miss Goddard predeceased decedent, an event which never occurred. While Miss Goddard did provide for the contingency which did occur, i.e., decedent\u2019s death prior to that of Miss Goddard, her designation of the \u201cestate\u201d of decedent as the remainderman and the eventual distribution of Miss Goddard\u2019s assets to decedent\u2019s estate does not foreclose an inquiry into the manner of distribution of these assets. The court below held that Miss Goddard\u2019s assets were distributable under the provisions of decedent\u2019s will and from that decree the present appeal was taken.\nSection 14 of the Wills Act of 1947 (Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89, \u00a714, 20 P.S. \u00a7180.14), under \u201cRules of Interpretation,\u201d provides, inter alia: \u201cIn the absence of a contrary intent appearing therein, wills shall be construed as to real and personal estate in accordance with the following rules: (1) Wills construed as if executed immediately before death. Every will shall be construed, with reference to the testator\u2019s real and personal estate, to speak and take effect as if it had been executed immediately before the death of the testator.\u201d Assuming, arguendo, that no contrary intent appears in decedent\u2019s will, application of this rule of construction would require that we construe decedent\u2019s will as if it had been executed immediately before her death on March 13, 1963, at which time decedent had no interest\u2014vested or contingent, legal or equitable\u2014in the assets of Miss Goddard\u2019s estate. \u201cIt is presumed that a testator intended to dispose only of property which he owned, unless the language of the will, or the circumstances of the case as shown by proper evidence, indicate otherwise. So, the will should not be given the construction that the testator intended to dispose of property not owned by him unless the language he used conclusively evidences such a purpose, or is open to, or fairly susceptible of, no other construction.\u201d 96 C.J.S. Wills, \u00a7751. See: 94 C.J.S. Wills, \u00a776.\nA will is a medium by which a person can dispose of property, real and personal, after his death. During his lifetime, a person cannot give or dispose of property which he does not own or in which he has no interest; no more so can a person make a postmortem disposition of property which at the time of his death he does not own or in which he has no right, legal or equitable. See: Williams Estate, 349 Pa. 568, 37 A. 2d 584 (1944). Only property which is descendible is devisable. See also: In re Jamieson Estate, 374 Mich. 231, 132 N. W. 2d 1, 3 (1965).\nWe recognize, of course, the well-settled principles that generally the purpose of a residuary clause in a will is to pass the whole estate and to avoid an intestacy and that our duty is to accomplish that purpose, if possible (Fuller\u2019s Estate, 225 Pa. 626, 74 A. 623 (1909)) and that a general residuary clause carries every interest, known or unknown, immediate or remote, unless such interest is clearly excluded (Ingham\u2019s Estate, 315 Pa. 293, 297, 172 A. 662 (1934)). However, these principles do not apply until it has been demonstrated that the testator at the time of death actually had an interest, recognized in law or in equity, as opposed to an expectancy in the property; absent such an interest, post-mortem disposition of the property cannot be exercised. Moreover, this interest must exist at the time of death rather than at the time of distribution: Brothers Estates, 156 Pa. Superior Ct. 292, 295, 40 A. 2d 156 (1944). \u201cA legatee who dies before the testator cannot devise or bequeath properly which he would have taken under the will of such testator if he had outlived him. The same is true in the case of a prospective heir who predeceases the ancestor from whom he would have inherited. In both cases, the legatee and heir had a mere expectancy prior to the testator\u2019s and ancestor\u2019s death, and if such expectancy does not materialize into fulfillment, it never becomes a vested interest that can be passed by a will. . . . Rights which arise at or after testator\u2019s death and which never belonged to him during his life. . . cannot be bequeathed.\u201d 1 Bowe-Parker: Page on Wills, \u00a716.2, at 751, 754. See also: Id. at \u00a716.17; Thompson, Wills, \u00a740, at 79 (3d Ed.).\nThe court below, although recognizing that the decision was not binding in the instant situation, referred to the following language of Mr. Justice McBride in Bigony Estate, 397 Pa. 102, 105, 152 A. 2d 901 (1959) : \u201cUnquestionably, if the will contained only the general residuary clause without the restrictive words \u2018consisting of,\u2019 all of the testatrix\u2019s property, including property or funds of any kind received after or before her death under the Intestate Act from the estate of her husband [sic] would pass under this clause.\u201d (Emphasis added) Our Court interpreted the language of the Bigony will as indicative of an . intent to limit the property disposed of by the residuary clause to assets known to the testatrix and which she carefully described. In Bigony, the testatrix outlived her husband by thirty-seven years a,nd the after-acquired assets consisted of the balance of. one-half of a trust fund set up by the husband which was declared invalid after testatrix\u2019 death as well as a |5,000.00 intestate allowance from the husband\u2019s estate. While these assets were not realized until three years after testatrix\u2019 death, both at the time of the execution of her will and at the time of her death, she did have an interest in these assets, unlike the factual situation in this appeal. The language in Bigony must be read in the light of its factual matrix and affords no comfort to appellee\u2019s position in this litigation.\nThe phrase \u201cafter-acquired property\u201d employed in connection with decedents\u2019 estates involves a twofold concept: (1) property acquired by a testator between the time of the execution of his will and the time of his death; (2) property acquired after the death of the testator. As to the former, there is no doubt that a testator can dispose by will of property which he did not own at the time he executed his will but did acquire prior to his death, since under the Wills Act of 1947, supra, as amended, after-acquired property passes by a general devise or bequest in the absence of a contrary intent found in the will. See: Bigony Estate, supra.\nAs to property acquired after the death of the testator, the instant appeal presents a question, apparently, of first impression. The lack of case law on this subject may well be attributed to a general recognition that a testator cannot dispose of property in which at the time of his death he has neither ownership nor interest of any kind.\nThe ruling below was based almost entirely on the belief of the court that there was no sound reason why the testatrix under the instant circumstances should not have the right to make disposition by will of property acquired after death. It must be noted that the court did not bottom its decision on any intent to be found either in Miss Goddard\u2019s will or that of decedent. As to the latter, the court below stated: \u201cThe intention of the testatrix appears clear. She does not qualify the language by restricting her residuary estate only to that part which she owned at the exact moment of her death, nor does she affirmatively indicate that her estate shall include amounts added thereto subsequent to her death. It would be pure fiction and a perversion to contend that her intention had anything to do with creating an intestacy permitting an heir not mentioned in her will to inherit. For this reason, we believe this case does not involve the determination of the intention of the testator.\u201d\nBeginning with the proposition that it did not \u201cshock the court to have the principles of orphans\u2019 court law or the dispository provisions of a will applicable to assets coming into an estate after death of the person creating said estate,\u201d the court analogized these assets to dividends declared after a testator\u2019s death, recoveries in death actions, medical payments, Social Security, Veterans\u2019 Administration and retirement benefits which come into a decedent\u2019s estate after death. In our view, these analogies are unsound. In each instance cited by the court below the testator had at the time of his death an interest or ownership in assets from which flowed these post-mortem benefits. Whether such an interest or ownership arose by reason of stock ownership, by statute as in the ease of recovery in death actions, by contracts\u2014insurance or otherwise\u2014or by operation of law, to treat such post-mortem benefits as estate assets does not contraindicate the soundness of the rule that a testator cannot dispose of property in which he lacks any interest, legal or equitable, at the time of death.\nWe have examined the cases in other jurisdictions which gave \u201ccomfort in support of [the court\u2019s] position\u201d ; we find these cases entirely inapposite. We believe that the court below erred in its conclusion that assets springing from Miss Goddard\u2019s estate and not owned in any sense by decedent at the time of her death were part of her estate which passed under the terms of her will.\nFurthermore, we fail to find any other basis upon which this property might pass under decedent\u2019s will.\nIt is important to note that there is no evidence or reasonable inference that decedent knew of the contents of her sister\u2019s will. It seems evident that when decedent planned the testamentary disposition of her property she thought in terms of her own property and not in terms of the property of another.\nMoreover, we fail to find within the four corners of Miss Goddard\u2019s will any intention on her part that her assets were to be distributed in accordance with the terms of decedent\u2019s will, a will about which, so far as this record shows, she had no knowledge. Miss Goddard\u2019s will was written twenty-three years prior to the execution of decedent\u2019s will. If we are to maintain the integrity of our case law that the intentions of a testator are to be determined from circumstances existing at the time of the execution of the will (Lewis Estate, 407 Pa. 518, 180 A. 2d 919 (1962) ; Woodward Estate, 407 Pa. 638, 182 A. 2d 732 (1962)), then we must conclude that the circumstances existing when Miss Goddard drew her will do not reflect any intention to provide for ultimate disposition of her property-under the testamentary- scheme of decedent\u2019s will.\n\u2022 An .analysis of. Miss Goddard\u2019s will indicates a gift of her. assets to decedent, if living and, if not living, to decedent\u2019s \u201cestate.\u201d We find in the word \u201cestate\u201d no; such magic as compels the conclusion that Miss Goddard intended a disposition of her assets to those designated as recipients of decedent\u2019s bounty rather than to those-who'would take under the intestate laws. If it had been Miss Goddard\u2019s intention that her assets be distributed according to her sister\u2019s plan, the burden of such proof rested upon the estate of decedent; absent such' a demonstration of proof and on the state of this record, we find no evidence of such an intention on the part of Miss Goddard as urged by the estate.\nDecree reversed. Each party pay own costs.\nA first codicil to this win, dated May 9, 1961, merely corrected the name of one of the legatees. A second codicil, dated July 11, 1961, identified the use to be made of the gift to one of the charities, and a third codicil, dated November 14, 1962, merely added another friend to whom a pecuniary legacy was given.\nThe assets of Miss Goddard\u2019s estate plus increments thereon total approximately $70,000.00.\n\u201c. . . an expectancy is the chance of obtaining property by inheritance or by will from a person now living. Such chances are not in themselves rights in property.\u201d 6 Williston, Contracts, \u00a71681A, at 4745 (Rev. Ed.) Cf., Restatement, Property, \u00a7153, comment c.\nUnder decedent\u2019s will, her enti/re estate was placed in trust for Miss Goddard for life. Appellant pertinently queries whether decedent intended to fund Miss Goddard\u2019s life estate with assets that could not be obtained until Miss Goddard\u2019s death.\n\u201c. . . if the testator has not yet died, a legatee named in his will has no interest in the testator\u2019s property, even though the testator is unlikely to change his will and even though he is hopelessly insane so that he will be unable to change his wiU.\u201d Restatement 2d, Trusts, \u00a786, Comment a. It should be noted that whether one has a transmissible interest or an expectancy depends on whether the contingency of taking rests upon the capacity to take. For instance, if T gives a remainder to A, should B die without issue, such an interest is transmissible by A, even during T\u2019s lifetime because the contingency does not affect A\u2019s capacity to take, the contingency being whether B dies without issue, not whether A is living or dead.
