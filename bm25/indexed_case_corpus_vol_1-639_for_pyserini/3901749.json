The issues for argument, rephrased for clarity, are:\n(1) Does the Superior Court\u2019s holding, which permits a plaintiff who fails to produce sufficient evidence of regularity, frequency and proximity of exposure to a defendant\u2019s specific asbestos containing product to defeat summary judgment by submitting generic, non-case-specific expert affidavits, conflict with this Court\u2019s holding in Gregg v. V-J Auto Parts, 596 Pa. 274, 943 A.2d 216 (2007)?\n(2) Does the Superior Court\u2019s holding that a plaintiff need not produce evidence that a defendant\u2019s asbestos-containing product produced dust conflict with this Court\u2019s holding in Gregg v. V-J Auto Parts, 596 Pa. 274, 943 A.2d 216 (2007)?"}
