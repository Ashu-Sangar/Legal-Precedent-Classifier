T. and C. M. Mead,\u201d etc., No. 33, January term, 1894. [The preceding case.J\nFor reasons given in that case, and in the opinion of the court sent up with the record in this case, we think the learned judge\u2019s refusal of the application was in the exercise of a sound legal discretion, and therefore not reviewable here.\nDecree affirmed with costs to be paid by petitioners."}
