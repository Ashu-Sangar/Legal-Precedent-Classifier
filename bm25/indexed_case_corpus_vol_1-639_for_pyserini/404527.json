We direct the Superior Court to reconsider its decision based on the standard this Court set forth in Davis v. Mullen, 565 Pa. 386, 773 A.2d 764 (2001), specifically \u201cthat a jury\u2019s award of medical expenses without compensation for pain and suffering should not be disturbed where the trial court had a reasonable basis to believe that: (1) the jury did not believe the plaintiff suffered any pain and suffering; or (2) that a preexisting condition or injury was the sole cause of the alleged pain and suffering.\u201d Id. at 767.\nWe further direct the Superior Court to address the issue raised in the cross-appeal docketed at 1000 WDA 2000 if appropriate."}
