{"id": "953667", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis bill was by stockholders of a corporation against its president for an account, on the ground that he had procured a sale of the property of the company and had acquired possession thereof under circumstances that made him a trustee of the stockholders. There is no dispute as to the findings of fact. The law applicable to them is clearly stated by the learned judge of the common pleas, and on his opinion we affirm the decree at the cost of the appellant."}
