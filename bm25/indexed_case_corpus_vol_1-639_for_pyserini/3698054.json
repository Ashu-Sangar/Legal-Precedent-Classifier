Allocatur is DENIED as to all remaining issues. The issues, as stated by Petitioner, are:\na. Is the public participation provision of the Sunshine Act 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 710.1 satisfied when members of the public are never permitted to address the governing body of a municipality, but are only permitted to address a committee comprised of less than a quorum?\nb. Does a meeting of a committee of a municipal governing body, comprised of less than a quorum of the governing body, meet the Sunshine Act\u2019s definition of a \u201cspecial meeting\u201d and if so does this relieve the governing body of the obligation to receive public comment at its meetings?"}
