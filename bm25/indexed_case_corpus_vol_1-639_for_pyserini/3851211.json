{"id": "3851211", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice SAYLOR.\nThis case primarily concerns the constitutionality of Pennsylvania\u2019s fetal homicide statute; it additionally entails a challenge to jury instructions given at Appellant\u2019s trial, where he was convicted of voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child.\nI.\nIn the late 1990s, Pennsylvania\u2019s General Assembly enacted the Crimes Against the Unborn Child Act. The Act added Chapter 26 to the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, which created several new offenses designed to protect unborn children from unlawful injury or death. Under the Act, an individual commits criminal homicide of an unborn child if he or she intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently causes the death of an unborn child, see 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2603, a term that refers to the fetus at any stage of gestation. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2602. Accordingly, the Act establishes the crimes of first, second, and third degree murder of an unborn child, as well as voluntary manslaughter and aggravated assault of an unborn child. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2604-2606. Its criminal provisions do not apply, however, to consensual abortion, doctors engaged in good faith medical practice, or pregnant women in regard to crimes against their own unborn children. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2608(a). Of particular relevance to this appeal are the Act\u2019s specifications with regard to voluntary manslaughter:\n(a) Offense defined. \u2014 A person who kills an unborn child without lawful justification commits voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child if at the time of the killing he is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by: (1) the mother of the unborn child whom the actor endeavors to kill, but he negligently or accidentally causes the death of the unborn child....\n* \u2756 * * * :Js\n(c) Penalty. \u2014 The penalty for voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child shall be the same as the penalty for voluntary manslaughter.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2605.\nII.\nIn late 2002, Appellant was living with his girlfriend, Lisa Hargrave, who was 22 to 28 weeks pregnant. According to Appellant\u2019s statement to police, on New Year\u2019s Eve 2002, he and Hargrave consumed alcohol and cocaine at a party and then returned to their apartment, where Hargrave continued to ingest cocaine. Appellant asked Hargrave to cease using drugs for the remainder of the night in view of her pregnancy. When Hargrave failed to comply, an argument ensued, during which Appellant \u201cblacked out.\u201d When he awoke, he found himself on top of Hargrave strangling her so that she was almost unconscious. Because he feared Hargrave would call the police, he wrapped her feet and hands with masking tape and left the room. When he could hear her yelling and attempting to free herself, he returned, taped her mouth shut, and left the room again. After Hargrave continued to struggle to break free, Appellant returned to the bedroom once more and strangled her until she stopped breathing. He then dragged her body into the closet.\nOn January 6, 2003, Appellant arrived at the Wilkes-Barre Police Department and informed an officer that he had strangled his girlfriend to death. When the police arrived at the apartment, they found Hargrave\u2019s partially decomposed body in the closet with her hands, feet, and mouth bound with masking tape. Appellant was charged with the murder of Hargrave, see 18 -Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2501(a), and, pursuant to the Act, with the criminal homicide of her unborn child as well. He filed a pre-trial motion challenging the constitutionality of the Act on, inter alia, due process and equal protection grounds; this motion was denied. The matter then proceeded to trial by jury in October 2003, at which Appellant did not testify.\nAt trial, the coroner stated that, after performing autopsies of Hargrave and her unborn child, he concluded that Hargrave\u2019s cause of death was \u201cstrangulation by history,\u201d which refers to the events immediately preceding the death, see N.T. October 20, 2003, at 142-44; this conclusion was apparently based, in part, upon the occurrences as related by Appellant in his statement to police. The coroner also found that the fetus\u2019s death was caused by \u201casphyxia due to the death of the mother by homicide.\u201d Id. at 148. In both cases, the coroner determined that the manner of death was homicide.\nBefore deliberations began, Appellant objected to the trial court\u2019s refusal to charge the jury on the mens rea elements \u201cnegligently\u201d and \u201caccidentally\u201d found in the voluntary manslaughter provision of the Crimes Against the Unborn Child Act (see supra). The trial court overruled the objection, however, opting to allow the jury to use the \u201ccommon and ordinary understanding\u201d of the terms. Id. at 911. The jury found Appellant guilty-but-mentally-ill of third degree murder as to Hargrave, and guilty-but-mentally-ill of voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child. Appellant was sentenced to consecutive terms of imprisonment of fifteen to forty years for the murder of Hargrave, and five to twenty years for voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child. Appellant\u2019s post-sentence motions were denied.\nAfter a unanimous panel of the Superior Court affirmed in a published opinion, see Commonwealth v. Bullock, 868 A.2d 516 (Pa.Super.2005), this Court granted discretionary review. See Commonwealth v. Bullock, 584 Pa. 705, 885 A.2d 40 (2005) (per curiam). Only the judgment of sentence for voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child is at issue in this appeal.\nIII.\nWe turn first to the question of the constitutionality of the Crimes Against the Unborn Child Act. It is foundational that all legislation duly enacted by the General Assembly enjoys a strong presumption of validity, and \u201cwill only be declared void if it violates the Constitution \u2018clearly, palpably and plainly.\u2019 \u201d City of Phila. v. Commonwealth, 575 Pa. 542, 573, 838 A.2d 566, 585 (2003) (quoting Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. McCafferty, 563 Pa. 146, 155, 758 A.2d 1155, 1160 (2000)). The party challenging the statute\u2019s constitutionality \u201cbears a very heavy burden to prove that it is unconstitutional,\u201d moreover, and all doubts on the question are resolved in favor of a finding of constitutionality. Payne v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 582 Pa. 375, 383, 871 A.2d 795, 800 (2005). Because this is an issue of law, our scope of review is plenary and our standard of review is de novo. See Commonwealth v. Cousin, 585 Pa. 287, 294, 888 A.2d 710, 714 (2005).\nA. Vagueness\nAppellant initially contends that the Act violates due process under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. He proffers that, absent a requirement that the fetus be viable outside the womb at the time of its death, the statute fails to provide fair warning of precisely what conduct is prohibited. Appellant reasons, in this regard, that, until a fetus is viable (in the sense that it could likely survive outside the womb), it cannot actually be alive and, hence, cannot suffer death. Such failure to include a viability component, according to Appellant, permits arbitrary application and enforcement of the statute because it is impossible for a person of ordinary intelligence to understand what \u201cdeath\u201d means when applied to a non-viable fetus. See Brief for Appellant at 13-14.\nThe void-for-vagueness doctrine \u201crequires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u201d Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1858, 75 L.Ed.2d 903 (1983); see Commonwealth v. Mayfield, 574 Pa. 460, 467, 832 A.2d 418, 422 (2003). Although criminal statutes should be strictly construed in favor of lenity where there is ambiguity, their words are, nonetheless, interpreted according to the \u201cfair import of their terms.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 105; see Commonwealth v. Booth, 564 Pa. 228, 234 & n. 5, 766 A.2d 843, 846 & n. 5 (2001).\nPresently, the Act prescribes that it is unlawful to intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, or negligently cause the death of an unborn child, defined to include all stages of gestation from fertilization to live birth. This definition is straightforward. In the first place, the concept of a fetus or unborn child as a potential victim of violence is neither obscure nor difficult to grasp. See Booth, 564 Pa. at 241, 766 A.2d at 850 (\u201cToday it is understood that a mother and her unborn child are separate and distinct entities, and that medicine is generally able to prove the corpus delicti of the homicide of an unborn child.\u201d). It is also clear that, by defining unborn child to include all stages of gestation, see supra note 2, the General Assembly intended to eliminate any viability requirement. Accord People v. Ford, 221 Ill.App.3d 354, 163 Ill.Dec. 766, 581 N.E.2d 1189, 1198 (1991) (reaching same conclusion with regard to a similarly-worded definition of unborn child). Moreover, as appellate courts in other jurisdictions have elaborated in construing similar feticide enactments, the statutory language does not purport to define the concept of personhood or establish when life as a human being begins and ends; rather, it imposes criminal liability for the destruction of a human embryo or fetus that is biologically alive. See, e.g., State v. Merrill, 450 N.W.2d 318, 324 (Minn. 1990) (\u201cPeople are free to differ or abstain on the profound philosophical and moral questions of whether an embryo is a human being, or on whether or at what stage the embryo or fetus is ensouled or acquires \u2018personhood.\u2019 These questions are entirely irrelevant to criminal liability under the statute.\u201d). In this context, death occurs when the embryo or fetus \u201cceases to have the properties of life.\u201d Id.; see also Ford, 163 Ill.Dec. 766, 581 N.E.2d at 1201 (\u201cThe statute only requires proof that, whatever the entity within the mother\u2019s womb is called, it had life and, because of the acts of the defendant, it no longer does.\u201d); see also Bullock, 868 A.2d at 522 (\u201cClearly, a death occurs when the embryo or fetus no longer has the capacity to thrive or grow.\u201d (citing Webster\u2019s New Collegiate Dictionary 289 (8th ed.1981) (defining death as \u201ca permanent cessation of all vital functions\u201d))).\nAppellant appears to accept that the Legislature intentionally omitted any viability requirement associated with the death of an unborn child under the statute, but largely premises his vagueness claim upon an assertion that the concept of death is difficult to understand relative to a fetus that is not viable (again, in the sense that it could likely survive outside the womb). We disagree, as we believe that the concepts of life and its cessation are readily understandable to persons of ordinary intelligence relative to biological life forms beginning at the cellular level \u2014 as noted, the concept of biological life extends to organisms that retain vital functions and the capacity to grow and thrive. Appellant offers no example of a circumstance in which an actor who causes the permanent cessation of all of the vital functions of an embryo or fetus would not conventionally understand that his conduct has caused the death of the embryo or fetus. Moreover, to accept that a fetus is not biologically alive until it can survive outside of the womb would be illogical, as such a concept would define fetal life in terms that depend upon external conditions, namely, the existing state of medical technology (which, of course, tends to improve over time). See Booth, 564 Pa. at 246 n. 18, 766 A.2d at 853 n. 18 (recognizing the General Assembly\u2019s findings concerning \u201cthe steady reduction in the age of fetal viability\u201d).\nAccordingly, viability outside of the womb is immaterial to the question of whether the defendant\u2019s actions have caused a cessation of the biological life of the fetus, and hence, to the question of whether the statute is vague in proscribing the killing of an unborn child. We find that individuals of ordinary intelligence are readily capable of discerning the conduct prohibited by the Act, and we fail to perceive anything in the legislation giving rise to a substantial concern that it may be discriminatorily enforced.\nB. Substantive Due Process\nAppellant also maintains that the statute is \u201cunconstitutionally broad\u201d for similar reasons, i.e., because it fails to \u201cdistinguish between viable or living organisms and nonviable or nonliving organisms.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 15. He contends that the statute\u2019s allegedly unnecessary breadth is fatal to its validity because it affects his fundamental liberty interest in remaining free from confinement, and thus, must be justified by a compelling state interest. In this respect, he notes that the United States Supreme Court has determined that a State\u2019s interest in fetal life only becomes \u201ccompelling\u201d at viability, see Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 163, 93 S.Ct. 705, 732, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973), a property that he alleges the unborn victim in the present case lacked.\nWe interpret this claim as sounding in substantive due process, as opposed to overbreadth, both because it appears in Appellant\u2019s brief under a general due process heading, see Brief for Appellant at 12, and because over-breadth claims only pertain in a First Amendment context. See City of Chicago v. Morales, 527 U.S. 41, 79, 119 S.Ct. 1849, 1870, 144 L.Ed.2d 67 (1999) (\u201c[W]e have not recognized an \u2018overbreadth\u2019 doctrine outside the limited context of the First Amendment.\u201d (quoting United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745, 107 S.Ct. 2095, 2100, 95 L.Ed.2d 697 (1987))). Under the doctrine of substantive due process, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, see U.S. Const. amend. IV, \u00a7 1 (\u201cnor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\u201d), guarantees more than fair process and the absence of physical restraint, but \u201cprovides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.\u201d Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 719-20, 117 S.Ct. 2258, 2267, 138 L.Ed.2d 772 (1997).\nAppellant characterizes the liberty interest affected by the Crimes Against the Unborn Child Act as his fundamental right to remain free from confinement; however, complying with the Act would not result in confinement. Moreover, Appellant does not reference any authority for the position that he has a right to unilaterally kill the unborn child carried by another person. To the contrary, the United States Supreme Court has affirmed that states have an \u201cimportant and legitimate interest\u201d in protecting fetal life at all stages, even if that interest only becomes \u201ccompelling\u201d at viability. Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 163, 93 S.Ct. 705, 732, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973); see Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 846, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2804, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992) (reaffirming that one of Roe\u2019s essential holdings was that \u201cthe State has legitimate interests from the outset of the pregnancy in protecting ... the life of the fetus ... \u201d); see also Bullock, 868 A.2d at 522-24 (discussing cases); accord People v. Davis, 7 Cal.4th 797, 30 Cal.Rptr.2d 50, 872 P.2d 591, 597 (1994) (observing that Roe \u201cdoes not hold that the state has no legitimate interest in protecting the fetus until viability\u201d); State v. Merrill, 450 N.W.2d 318, 322 (Minn.1990) (noting that the state\u2019s interest in protecting \u201cthe potentiality of human life\u201d includes protection of the unborn child, \u201cwhether an embryo or a nonviable or viable fetus\u201d); State v. Alfieri, 132 Ohio App.3d 69, 724 N.E.2d 477, 482 (1998) (explaining that, even under Roe, \u201cthere has never been any notion that a third party ... has a fundamental liberty interest in terminating another\u2019s pregnancy\u201d); People v. Ford, 221 Ill.App.3d 354, 163 Ill.Dec. 766, 581 N.E.2d 1189, 1199 (1991). Therefore, as Appellant has failed to identify any fundamental right infringed by the statute, his substantive due process claim fails.\nC. Equal Protection\nAppellant next urges us to find that the statute violates the Equal Protection Clause. See U.S. Const, amend. IV, \u00a7 1 (\u201cnor shall any State ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws\u201d). He proffers that natural fathers who kill their unborn children are similarly situated to pregnant mothers who kill the fetus they are carrying. In forwarding this argument, Appellant again maintains that fundamental rights are in issue, this time not only his right to remain free from confinement, but his \u201cliberty interest to father children and in the growth and development of the fetus.\u201d Brief for Appellant at 17. Thus, he posits, \u201c[t]he fact of pregnancy alone, encompassed within a mother\u2019s privacy right, is not a compelling reason for the state to excuse a mother who perpetrates a crime against her own unborn child, yet hold the natural father criminally responsible.... \u201dId.\nWhile the Equal Protection Clause assures that all similarly situated persons are treated alike, it does not obligate the government to treat all persons identically. See Small v. Horn, 554 Pa. 600, 615, 722 A.2d 664, 672 (1998) (citing City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 3254, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985)). Thus, the Clause does not prevent state legislatures from drawing classifications, so long as they are reasonable. See generally Harrisburg Sch. Dist. v. Zogby, 574 Pa. 121, 136, 828 A.2d 1079, 1088 (2003) (affirming that equal protection precepts \u201cdo not vitiate the Legislature\u2019s power to classify, which necessarily flows from its general power to enact regulations for the health, safety, and welfare of the community\u201d). In determining constitutional reasonableness, this Court first ascertains the appropriate level of judicial scrutiny to apply, which in turn depends upon the type of categorization involved and the nature of the right affected. Where the challenged governmental action does not burden \u201cfundamental\u201d or \u201cimportant\u201d rights, and does not make a suspect or quasi-suspect classification, it is subject to rational-basis review. Small, 554 Pa. at 615, 722 A.2d at 672 (citing McCusker v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeal Bd. (Rushton Mining Co.), 536 Pa. 380, 385, 639 A.2d 776, 778 (1994)). See generally Commonwealth v. Bell, 512 Pa. 334, 344-45, 516 A.2d 1172, 1178 (1986) (summarizing the three levels of scrutiny in Pennsylvania law). Suspect classes are race and national origin, and for purposes of state law, alienage; quasi-suspect classifications are gender and legitimacy. See Small, 554 Pa. at 615 nn. 14-15, 722 A.2d at 672 nn. 14-15.\nPresently, the challenged distinction consists of the mother versus everyone else. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2608(a)(3) (exempting the pregnant woman in regard to crimes against her own unborn child). This classification is neither suspect nor quasi-suspect, and the primary asserted right involved, i.e., the \u201cright\u201d to unilaterally kill the unborn child that another person is carrying, is neither fundamental nor important \u2014 indeed, it does not exist. Nor is any right of fathers to produce children and promote their development adversely affected by the Act; rather, the statute is plainly aimed at protecting fetal growth and development from unlawful interference. Hence, to survive judicial scrutiny, the present classification need only satisfy the rational basis standard.\nUnder rational basis review, a classification will be upheld so long as it bears a reasonable relationship to a legitimate state purpose. See Harrisburg Sch. Dist. v. Zogby, 574 Pa. 121, 136, 828 A.2d 1079, 1088 (2003). Specifically, \u201cthe classification, though discriminatory, will be deemed reasonable if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived to sustain it.\u201d Id. at 137, 828 A.2d at 1089. In undertaking this analysis, courts are free to hypothesize grounds the Legislature might have had for the classification. See id. at 137-38, 828 A.2d at 1089 (citing Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Labor & Indus., 461 Pa. 68, 84, 334 A.2d 636, 644 (1975); Geary v. Retirement Bd. of Allegheny County, 426 Pa. 254, 259-60, 231 A.2d 743, 746 (1967)). It bears repeating that all doubts on this question, as with all questions of constitutional validity, are resolved in favor of upholding the statute.\nIn our view, the General Assembly had a legitimate basis for distinguishing between the mother and everyone else. Simply put, the mother is not similarly situated to everyone else, as she alone is carrying the unborn child. Under prevailing jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, the fact of her pregnancy gives her (and only her) certain liberty interests in relation to the termination of that pregnancy that the Legislature could reasonably have sought to avoid infringing by exempting her from criminal liability under this particular statute. Cf. Witters v. State Comm\u2019n for the Blind, 112 Wash.2d 363, 771 P.2d 1119, 1123 (1989) (rejecting an equal protection challenge where the classification at issue served the Legislature\u2019s interest in complying with constitutional requirements). Although the Act contains a separate exemption for voluntary abortion, see 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2608(a)(1), because of the mother\u2019s unique connection to the fetus there are various situations even outside of the abortion context (such as those pertaining to drug addiction or attempted suicide) in which she alone might bear an increased risk of criminal prosecution were it not for the (a)(3) exception. The Legislature could rationally have taken this into account and sought to place the mother on a similar footing to all other persons as respects these types of situations. While this does result in the mother being treated more leniently under the Act as regards crimes against her unborn child, such a result would only be constitutionally problematic if it stemmed from an arbitrary classification, which, as noted, it does not. Accordingly, Appellant has not carried his burden of proving that the challenged distinction is \u201cclearly, palpably, and plainly\u201d unconstitutional.\nIV.\nWe now turn to Appellant\u2019s alternate claim that he should receive a new trial due to an error in the trial court\u2019s jury instructions. The court first instructed the jury concerning the possible verdicts as to the killing of Hargrave, and then as to the killing of the unborn child. In this latter portion of the charge, after delineating the elements of murder of an unborn child, including malice, the trial court instructed the jury on the offense' of voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child:\nIf you do not find that the Defendant had malice ... you may find him guilty of voluntary manslaughter of the unborn child as long as you are satisfied that the following three elements have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt: first, that the unborn child is dead. Second, that the Defendant killed it. And, third, that the Defendant had the intent to kill the mother of the unborn child.\nN.T. October 20, 2003, at 907. As discussed above, the applicable statutory definition of manslaughter of an unborn child clarifies that the defendant must have been\nacting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by the mother of the unborn child whom the actor endeavors to kill, but he negligently or accidentally causes the death of the unborn child.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2605(a)(1) (emphasis added). Appellant states that the Act establishes a minimum mens rea, relative to causing fetal death, of negligence or accident, which the judge refused to define for the jury.\nA. Negligence\nIn the present context, the term \u201cnegligence\u201d means criminal negligence, see 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302, official cmt., which is defined as follows:\nA person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor\u2019s failure to perceive it, considering the nature and intent of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(b)(4); see Commonwealth v. Heck, 517 Pa. 192, 201, 535 A.2d 575, 580 (1987); Commonwealth v. Ketterer, 725 A.2d 801, 806-07 (Pa.Super.1999). This is a higher level of negligence than ordinary tort negligence. See Commonwealth v. Huggins, 575 Pa. 395, 404, 836 A.2d 862, 867 (2003).\nAppellant argues that the judge\u2019s failure to define criminal negligence allowed the jury to convict on the basis of ordinary negligence. The Commonwealth counters that the charge must be read as a whole, and that the judge had previously defined gross negligence. Therefore, according to the Commonwealth, the judge\u2019s overall instructions accurately reflected the law. See Brief for Appellee at 19. While the judge did define gross negligence, see N.T. October 20, 2003 at 895, this definition was provided as part of the charge on the homicide of the mother, and not the unborn child. The Commonwealth\u2019s suggestion that the jury must have understood the same definition to apply to mere negligence, a distinct term recited as an element of a different offense, is not well taken. We find that the trial court erred in refusing Appellant\u2019s request that it define criminal negligence for purposes of the offense of voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child. See Commonwealth v. Safrit, 517 Pa. 484, 485, 538 A.2d 1335, 1335 (1988) (per curiam) (noting the necessity of a charge on the applicable mens rea requirement); see also Commonwealth v. Mason, 474 Pa. 308, 311, 378 A.2d 807, 808 (1977) (\u201cThe trial court\u2019s refusal to charge the jury concerning the element of intent necessary to convict of voluntary manslaughter was error.\u201d).\nThis raises the question of whether the error was harmless. The Superior Court deemed the error harmless by observing that the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to support a finding of criminal negligence. See Bullock, 868 A.2d at 526. Evidentiary sufficiency, however, is not the correct standard where the trial court errs. Rather, under the harmless error doctrine, the judgment of sentence will be affirmed in spite of the error only where the reviewing court concludes beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not contribute to the verdict. See Commonwealth v. Samuels, 566 Pa. 109, 112-13, 778 A.2d 638, 641 (2001).\nUpon review under this standard, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s error in failing to define \u201cnegligently\u201d was harmless. The jury received the charge set forth above and ultimately convicted Appellant of voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child. One of the elements that the trial judge recited for this offense was that Appellant must have \u201chad the intent to kill\u201d the mother. Thus, pursuant to the instructions \u2014 which the jury is presumed to have followed, see Commonwealth v. Williams, 581 Pa. 57, 78, 863 A.2d 505, 517 (2004) \u2014 the guilty verdict for manslaughter of an unborn child subsumed a specific finding by the jury that Appellant intended to kill Hargrave. Further, it is undisputed that Appellant was aware of Hargrave\u2019s pregnancy, and that the jury knew of this awareness on Appellant\u2019s part. Any failure on Appellant\u2019s part to perceive that killing Hargrave would also result in the death of her unborn child, considering the nature and intent of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, would plainly \u201cinvoIve[ ] a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in [Appellant\u2019s] situation.\u201d Thus, as the degree of culpability actually found by the jury was at least criminal negligence with respect to the unborn child, the court\u2019s failure to define this term could not have contributed to the verdict.\nB. Accident\nAs part of this claim, Appellant also takes issue with the trial court\u2019s \u201cfailure to instruct on the mens rea component of \u2018accidentally.\u2019 \u201d Brief for Appellant at 10; see N.T. October 20, 2003, at 911 (reflecting the judge\u2019s decision to allow the jury to rely on the \u201ccommon or ordinary\u201d meaning of the term). Preliminarily, we find doubtful Appellant\u2019s suggestion that \u201caccidentally\u201d is a mens rea, or guilty mental state. Rather, it is a term of common usage that, in the present context, signifies the lack of any purpose or intention to kill the unborn child. For example, as the Superior Court observed, \u201cthe death of an unborn child could be considered \u2018accidental\u2019 if the perpetrator was not aware the mother was pregnant....\u201d See Bullock, 868 A.2d at 526. In this respect, the offense as described under Section 2605(a)(1) embodies the concept of transferred intent, similar to that reflected in the traditional manslaughter offense when the actor \u201cnegligently or accidentally\u201d kills someone other the individual whom \u201cthe actor endeavors to kill.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503(a)(2). Appellant does not reference any authority for the position that \u201caccidentally\u201d must be defined by the trial court, and we are unaware of any; indeed, the jury would appear capable of applying a common-sense meaning to the term. Cf. Commonwealth v. Lambert, 529 Pa. 320, 339, 603 A.2d 568, 577 (1992) (indicating that the term, \u201cknowingly created a grave risk of death to others,\u201d need not be defined by the trial court, as the jury was able to apply a common-sense meaning). Finally, as we have already determined that the evidence was uncontested that Appellant was criminally negligent in the killing of the unborn victim, whether or not the jury had an incorrect understanding of the term \u201caccidentally\u201d is inconsequential.\nV.\nFor the reasons stated, the judgment of sentence for voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child is affirmed.\nChief Justice CAPPY, Justice CASTILLE, Justice NEWMAN, Justice EAKIN and Justice BALDWIN join the opinion.\nJustice BAER files a concurring opinion.\n. Act of October 2, 1997, P.L. 379, No. 44, effective March 31, 1998 (as amended, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2601-2609).\n. Section 2602 provides this definition by reference to the Abortion Control Act, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3201-3220. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3203 (defining both \"unborn child\u201d and \"fetus\u201d as \"an individual organism of the species homo sapiens from fertilization until live birth\u201d).\n. As noted, a contention surrounding the jury instructions given at trial is before the Court. However, the constitutional question must be addressed because, even if Appellant were to prevail with regard to the jury instruction issue, a new trial on the fetal homicide charge could only be required if the Act is deemed constitutional.\n. Although the Act does not reference the concept of viability, we note that the Abortion Control Act defines viability as \u2018\u2018[t]hat stage of fetal development when, in the judgment of the physician based on the particular facts of the case before him and in light of the most advanced medical technology and information available to him, there is a reasonable likelihood of sustained survival of the unborn child outside the body of his or her mother, with or without artificial support.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3203.\n. Appellant does argue that the statute leaves room for speculation in unusual cases in which, for example, brain activity in a developed fetus may have ceased but other vital functions remain. See Brief for Appellant at 14. It is well settled, however, that, outside the First Amendment context, vagueness challenges are examined in light of the facts of the case at hand, rather than abstract, hypothetical scenarios. See Commonwealth v. Heinbaugh, 467 Pa. 1, 5, 354 A.2d 244, 245 (1976) (quoting United States v. Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 550, 95 S.Ct. 710, 714, 42 L.Ed.2d 706 (1975)). If a defendant\u2019s conduct was clearly prohibited by the challenged statute, he will have received fair warning even though there may be doubts about the statute's applicability in other situations.\n. This Court has sometimes used the term \"sensitive classification\u2019' when referring to quasi-suspect classifications. See id.\n. Notably, this is not a gender classification, as male and female perpetrators (other than the mother) are treated identically under the Act.\n. This Court need not presently opine regarding the legal propriety of a hypothetical criminal prosecution of the mother in such circumstances. The relevant point here is that the classification is not arbitrary, but is based on the Legislature\u2019s recognition that the mother is differently situated from everyone else in relation to her unborn child.\n. Any inconsistency between this finding and the jury\u2019s failure to convict Appellant of first-degree murder of Hargrave is of no moment. See generally Commonwealth v. Magliocco, 584 Pa. 244, 266, 883 A.2d 479, 492 (2005) (\"[A] mere facial inconsistency in verdicts is not a valid basis upon which to upset a conviction which is otherwise proper, since consistency in verdicts is not required.\u201d).\n. For example, in his signed statement to the police \u2014 which was shown and read to the jury, see N.T. October 20, 2003, at 83, 85\u2014 Appellant indicates: \"She [Hargrave], being 6 months pregnant, I asked her to slow down [in her use of drugs].\u201d The officer who took the statement also provided uncontested testimony that, upon turning himself in to the police, Appellant orally admitted he knew Hargrave was pregnant. See id. at 73.\n. See generally Commonwealth ex rel. McCant v. Rundle, 418 Pa. 394, 396, 211 A.2d 460, 462 (1965) (describing the transferred intent rule); State v. Brady, 393 Md. 502, 903 A.2d 870, 875-78 (2006); In re T.K., 109 Ohio St.3d 512, 849 N.E.2d 286, 289 (2006) (\u201c[U]nder the doctrine of transferred intent, an offender who intentionally acts to harm someone but ends up accidentally harming another is criminally liable as if the offender had intended to harm the actual victim.\u201d); State v. Horne, 282 S.C. 444, 319 S.E.2d 703, 704 (1984) (explaining the operation of transferred intent in a common-law fetal homicide scenario).\n. We note that the Act\u2019s general definition of criminal homicide of an unborn child indicates that that the offense includes the mens reas of intentionally, knowingly, recklessly, and negligently, see 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2603(a), whereas the specific definition of voluntary manslaughter of an unborn child clarifies that an accidental cause of death suffices so long as the actor endeavored to kill the mother. See id., \u00a7 2605(a)(1). There is no conflict between these two provisions, however, because Section 2603 does not preclude liability where the death of the unborn child is accidental. Furthermore, even if a conflict were deemed to exist, the particular definition of voluntary manslaughter would control. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1933 (providing that, in statutory construction, specific provisions prevail over general ones where a conflict exists)."}
