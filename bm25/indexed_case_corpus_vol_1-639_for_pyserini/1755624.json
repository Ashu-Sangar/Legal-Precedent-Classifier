{"id": "1755624", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nFollowing his arrest in Delaware County for murder and related crimes, Floyd Wilson, Jr., incriminated himself in oral and written statements to the police. A pretrial motion to suppress evidence of these incriminations was denied after an evidentiary hearing. Subsequently, Wilson was brought to trial before a jury and was found guilty of murder of the first degree, attempted robbery, criminal conspiracy, and crimes committed with firearms. Post-verdict motions were denied, and a sentence of life imprisonment was imposed on the murder conviction. Additional prison sentences were imposed on the robbery and conspiracy convictions. An appeal from the life imprisonment sentence was filed directly in this Court. An appeal filed in the Superior Court from the other judgments of sentence was later certified here.\nIn his opening statement at trial, the assistant district attorney told the jury of Wilson\u2019s incriminating statements following his arrest and quoted from the written statement. However, the statements were not introduced into evidence or referred to again during the trial. Wilson contends the foregoing violated his constitutional right of confrontation (Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968)) and caused an unfair trial. Since we agree with the latter contention, we need not reach the Bruton issue.\nIf a confession is introduced into evidence at trial, the accused has the right to cross-examine those who verify it as to the circumstances and contents. He may also question its accuracy and even deny making it. Here, Wilson was denied the opportunity of making any inquiry as to the confession, its contents or circumstances even though the jury was effectively made aware that he had confessed and that he had \u201csigned a written confession, signed it on each and every page of the confession, and his father signed the confession at the end.\u201d Additionally, the jury was told by the assistant district attorney that Wilson had lied and tried to mislead the police as to the gun. All of this was without support in the record.\nThe most devastating evidence against one accused of crime is a confession or admission of guilt. This case is no exception. Even instructions such as were given here by the court to the jury cautioning that they should dismiss the statement from \u201cyour mind\u201d and let it not \u201center into your deliberations\u201d could not erase the impact of having the jury know Wilson had confessed. Any person conversant with the mental process of a jury in determining the guilt or innocence of an accused would be hard put to honestly deny this.\nThe Commonwealth urges that the assistant district attorney was acting in good faith during his opening presentation to the jury and intended as of that moment to make evidentiary use of Wilson\u2019s \u201cconfession,\u201d but changed his mind as the trial progressed. Suffice it to say, the good faith of the prosecuting official does not lessen the prejudice suffered by Wilson.\nNext, the Commonwealth, without specifically saying so, implies the issue has not been preserved for appellate review because Wilson\u2019s counsel \u201cindicated satisfaction\u201d with the trial court\u2019s cautionary instructions to dismiss the statement from \u201cyour mind.\u201d Under the singular circumstances this record presents, we rule the issue is properly before us.\nWilson\u2019s counsel made no objection during the opening statement and, in view of the court\u2019s pretrial ruling permitting evidentiary use of Wilson\u2019s in-custody statements, counsel\u2019s silence at this point is understandable. Cf. Commonwealth v. Fairbanks, 453 Pa. 90, 306 A.2d 866 (1973), and Commonwealth v. Meyers, 290 Pa. 573, 139 A. 374 (1927).\nAt the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, Wilson\u2019s counsel asked to see the court outside the presence of the jury and, at a conference that followed, counsel voiced concern about the assistant district attorney\u2019s opening statement that Wilson had given police a statement. The trial judge immediately assumed command, and advised counsel, \u201cI have tried to handle the situation [by giving the cautionary instructions] as best as can be under the circumstances.\u201d Defense counsel expressed satisfaction with the instructions insofar as they dealt with a reference to a \u201cstatement\u201d Wilson gave to police, but then reiterated his objection if the assistant district attorney referred to a \u201cconfession\u201d which, in fact, he did. Further discussion occurred during which defense counsel expressed agreement with the court that a \u201cconfession\u201d did exist; that the Commonwealth could have, but did not, introduce it; and, that some advantage to Wilson might result from the \u201cconfession\u201d not having been put into evidence. But defense counsel did not express satisfaction with the instructions if the opening statement referred to a \u201cconfession.\u201d\nFairly read, the record shows the court effectively overruled the objection insofar as it was based on a reference to a \u201cconfession.\u201d Our view of the record is in accord with that of the trial court in that it discussed the merits of the issue extensively and gave no indication it considered the issue waived in its opinion denying post-verdict motions. Accordingly, we do not believe the issue is waived.\nFinally, the trial court ruled the \u201cpassing reference\u201d to the \u201cconfession\u201d was harmless error. We are not so persuaded. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824,17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).\nJudgments reversed and new trial granted.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which LARSEN, J., joins.\n. In his opening statement, the assistant district attorney gave an extended definition and explanation of the criminal charges. He then minutely recited the circumstances of the attempted robbery and killing and described Wilson as one of the two armed participants. He then told of the seizure of a .32 caliber pistol from under a mattress in Wilson\u2019s father\u2019s bedroom and Wilson\u2019s arrest and interrogation at police headquarters. The assistant district attorney then followed with this:\n\u201cInterrogation of Wilson started. He gave an oral statement and that will be produced for you. He later signed a written confession, signed it on each and every page of the confession, after speaking to his father at police headquarters, and his father signed the confession at the end. That confession \u2014 and you will hear the words of it \u2014 does not say that the pistol used in the death is in his father\u2019s home. It says that it has been thrown away, discarded. What significance? Later that day sometime in the afternoon of the 26th after the written statement has now been taken, concluded, sometime in the morning after all of the formal proceedings involving Wilson have been completed, the bullet from Bob Sparks\u2019 body is recovered. It had not gone through his body. It has been recovered and can be compared for ballistics purposes.\n\u201cWilson is now informed of this fact by Detective John Lister of the Criminal Investigation Division of the District Attorney\u2019s Office. And at this time he says, yes, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s the gun I used. I killed him.\u201d\n. The opening statement had not yet been transcribed."}
