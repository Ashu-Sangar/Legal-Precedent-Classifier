{"id": "916823", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Mitchell,\nThe Act of May 8, 1854, P. L. 618, sec. 8, provides that \u201cif any person having taken upon himself the duties of his office as (school) director, shall neglect to attend any two regular meetings of the board in succession unless detained by sickness or prevented by absence from the district; . . . . the directors present shall have power to declare his seat on the board vacant, and to appoint another in his stead to serve until the next regular election.\u201d\n\u25a0 What shall be deemed a regular meeting is defined by the Act of April 11,1862, P. L. 471, which provides that \u201cthe term \u2018stated meetings\u2019 or \u2018regular meetings\u2019 shall hereafter be taken to mean the first meeting thereof for organization, after the annual election of directors or controllers, or the monthly or \u2022other periodical meetings held thereafter in accordance with the standing regulations of the board. . . . But if there are no standing regulations, then every meeting held in succession from the said first meeting of organization by adjournment to a time and place certain, and so entered on the minutes of the proper board, shall be to all intents and purposes regarded as .a regular meeting.\u201d\nUnder these statutory provisions the relator was ousted by the other members of the board from his office of school director for absence from two regular meetings. The facts are not in dispute, and an examination of them will settle the controversy.\nThe board met for organization on June 5 ; this was admittedly a regular meeting and the relator was present. This meeting adjourned \u201cto meet at the call of the president,\u201d and \u2022on such call a second meeting took place on June 15, from which the relator was absent. This was not a regular meeting by the terms of the statute, not being held in accordance with any standing regulations of the board nor by adjournment \u201c to a time and place certain.\u201d It was merely what is known in the common usage and understanding of legislative and corporate bodies as a special or adjourned meeting. The board however at this meeting adopted a standing regulation that \u201cthe regular monthly meeting was to be held at Hecksherville and Black Heath on the first Saturday of every month at half past \u00a1six o\u2019clock.\u201d\nThe next meeting took place in accordance with this regulation on July 1, the first Saturday of the month. This was a regular meeting and relator having been absent must have this counted against him. This meeting adjourned to July 10 at which date another meeting took place from which relator was absent. This was not a regular meeting within the present question, because the standing regulation adopted June 15 had fixed the first Saturday of every month for such meetings. It was therefore m\u00e9rely an adjourned meeting and the relator\u2019s absence was immaterial in the present controversy.\nThe next meeting, and the last with which we are concerned, took place on August 5, the first Saturday. This was a regular meeting and made the second in succession from which the relator was absent. The action declaring his seat vacant was taken at this meeting. It was clearly premature and therefore void. It is claimed by the relator that he was on his way to the meeting though somewhat late, and that the action of the board was hurried through and the meeting adjourned in order to prevent his attendance. On the other hand appellants claim that the resolution to vacate the seat was the last thing done before adjournment, and that the meeting was therefore over when this action was taken. It is not material to this case which version of the facts is correct. The action was void in either view. The statute does not authorize ouster for coming late to meetings but for absence, and absence cannot be determined or declared until the meeting is actually adjourned. If the relator had entered the meeting during the vote on adjournment he would have had a right to participate in the proceedings and to be counted as present at the meeting.\nIt was distinctly held in Zulich v. Bowman, 42 Pa. 83, that until the second meeting was over it could not be finally ascertained that the member was absent. See also Genesee Township Independent School District v. McDonald, 98 Pa. 444, 450.\nThere is another equally conclusive reason why no ouster can be declared at the second meeting. The act does not make absence from two regular meetings necessarily a cause for ouster, but only \u201c unless detained by sickness or prevented by absence from the district.\u201d Conceding that the burden of showing such excuse would be upon the absent member, he would nevertheless be entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard to present it and this could not be afforded without a subsequent meeting. The act is highly penal in that it permits a few individuals, liable to be governed by personal feeling, as is intimated not only by the learned judge in this case but also in Zulich v. Bowman, supra,- from the sam\u00e9 county, to oust by summary proceedings the officer duly chosen by the electors to represent them in their school matters. The act therefore must-be strictly construed, and every step in the proceedings must clearly appear to have been regular and within the authority conferred by the statute.\nThe case of Keating v. Jordan, 181 Pa. 168, much relied on by appellants, is in exact accord with the views now expressed. In that case there was a meeting on the call of the president on August 8, 1896, and subsequent meetings by adjournment on August 17, 20 and 24. There was no standing regulation of the board and therefore the meeting by adjournment a to time and place certain \u201d were regular meetings by the express language of the act of 1862. The ousted members were absent from the meetings of August 17, 20 and 24, though notified, and the action of ouster was not taken until the third meeting on August 24. This complied with every requisite of the statute as we have construed it.\nIt is very earnestly argued by appellants that mandamus will not lie and that the only remedy is by quo warranto against the person elected to fill the supposed vacancy. It would be sufficient answer to cite the precedent of Zulich v. Bowman, supra, but the remedy is clear on principle. There is no contest as to the relator\u2019s original title to his seat under a valid election, but only as to the legality of his ouster. If this was not valid, he never has been ousted at all, and mandamus is the proper remedy to prevent his further unlawful exclusion. W e have nothing to do with the title of his alleged successor who was apparently elected by the board to fill a vacancy that did not exist. This cannot affect the relator. He was admittedly elected to the office, has never been out of it in contemplation of law, and the mandamus simply compels the respondents to recognize his established right.\nJudgment affirmed with costs."}
