{"id": "3466862", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice CASTILLE.\nRecently, in Commonwealth v. Dengler, 890 A.2d 372 (2005), this Court held that expert testimony proffered in a Megan\u2019s Law II hearing to determine if a defendant is a sexually violent predator (\u201cSVP\u201d) is not subject to the Pennsylvania test for admissibility of novel scientific testimony derived from Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir.1923). In the case sub judice, this Court granted review to consider a separate question concerning the contours of an SVP hearing under Megan\u2019s Law II: \u201cWhether the Commonwealth, as part of its burden of proof in a proceeding to determine whether an individual is a sexually violent predator, must present evidence, in the form of a clinical diagnosis by a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist, that the individual suffers from a personality disorder or mental abnormality that makes the person likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses?\u201d Commonwealth v. Conklin, 581 Pa. 622, 867 A.2d 1261 (2005) (per curiam). The lower courts found that the licensed clinical social worker who testified in the SVP hearing in this case, though not a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist, nevertheless was qualified to offer opinion testimony on the question of whether appellant was an SVP because the clinical social worker qualified as a criminal justice expert and the statute requires no more. We agree with the lower courts\u2019 interpretation of the statutory requirement, and we therefore affirm.\nAppellant and his ex-wife, who are the parents of the minor victim, separated in January of 2001 and divorced in September of 2001. In March of 2002, the victim, who was then nine years old, informed her mother that appellant had been sexually abusing her for approximately three years. Appellant subsequently was arrested and charged with various sexual offenses. At appellant\u2019s trial, the child testified that the sexual assaults began when she was six years old and included repeated acts of rape and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse.\nOn March 19, 2003, following a jury trial before the Honorable Robert J. Conway, appellant was found guilty of rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault, incest, indecent assault, indecent exposure and corruption of a minor. Appellant\u2019s convictions qualified him as subject to the registration and notification provisions of Megan\u2019s Law II, and also required a determination of whether he was an SVP, which would expose him to additional measures. The Act defines a \u201csexually violent predator,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201c[a] person who has been convicted of a sexually violent offense as set forth in section 9795.1 (relating to registration) and who is determined to be a sexually violent predator under section 9795.4 (relating to assessments) due to a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9792.\nIn accordance with the Act, after receiving the verdict Judge Conway directed the State Sexual Offender Assessment Board to perform an SVP assessment of appellant. David Humphreys, a licensed clinical social worker and member of the Board, conducted the assessment and prepared a written report in which he concluded, to a reasonable degree of professional certainty, that appellant met the statutory criteria for classification as an SVP. Within the report, Humphreys described the records he had consulted as well as his interview with appellant, and then went on to discuss and apply the statutory criteria relevant to assessing SVP status, which included an evaluation of \u201c[fjactors related to mental illness, mental disability or mental abnormality.\u201d Humphreys opined that appellant\u2019s behavior and his presentation during his interview indicated that he had a \u201cform of pedophilia, which has been limited to incest,\u201d as well as an anti-social personality disorder, both of which were exacerbated by alcoholism. Humphreys described the reasons why his \u201cdiagnostic impressions\u201d in this regard led him to conclude that appellant \u201cdoes have a mental abnormality which appears to be both a congenital and/or an acquired condition of [appellant] that affects his emotional and volitional capacity ... in a manner that predisposes [appellant] to the commission of criminal sexual acts to the degree that makes [appellant] a menace to the health and safety of other persons.\u201d Offender Evaluation, 11-12. Humphreys also explained why he believed appellant\u2019s behavior was predatory.\nOn August 12, 2003, the trial court conducted an SVP hearing, at which the Commonwealth called Humphreys to testify as an expert. With respect to his qualifications, Humphreys testified that he had Bachelor\u2019s degrees in both psychology and sociology, as well as a Master\u2019s degree in social work; that he had been a member of the Sexual Offender Assessment Board since 1997; that he had seventeen years of experience as a social worker, all of which involved working with sex offenders; and that he was the director of the sex offender program at a local mental health agency, Tri-County Human Services. With respect to the criminal justice system, Humphreys testified that he had provided numerous evaluations for county agencies, as well as the county, state and federal probation and parole systems, and that he had testified as an expert on SVP classification in various courts in northeastern Pennsylvania. In addition to his work at Tri-County Human Services, where he worked with several hundred offenders a year, Humphreys testified that he conducted 12-20 SVP assessments per year; in roughly half of those cases, he had determined that the offender met the SVP classification criteria. N.T. 8/12/03, 2-6.\nOn cross-examination, appellant elicited that Humphrey was neither trained nor licensed as a psychiatrist or a psychologist and, as a result, he could not offer opinions to a reasonable degree of certainty in those fields. However, Humphreys noted that he was qualified and licensed, by his training and experience, to offer opinions and \u201cdiagnostic impressions\u201d \u201cto a reasonable degree of professional certainty based upon my experience, knowledge, background and training.\u201d Appellant then objected that Humphreys \u201cnot be considered qualified to issue a clinical diagnosis with regard to mental illness, mental disability or mental abnormality for the purpose of this Megan\u2019s Law hearing.\u201d The court overruled the objection and Humphreys testified consistently with his report. Id. at 6-11, 20-23.\nAfter hearing Humphreys\u2019 testimony and further argument from the parties, the trial court determined that appellant was an SVP. With respect to Humphreys\u2019 qualifications to testify on that question, the court noted that, \u201cwe [are] talking about a person who [has] been in that field for 17 years and has been appointed by the state to do exactly what he\u2019s done here today.\u201d The court added that, \u201c[w]e also have the conviction, which is a proven fact before us. We also have a period of over two years of having a young child, his daughter sexually molested in various ways.\u201d Id. at 38. The court then sentenced appellant to a term of imprisonment for ten to twenty years and a fine of $2,000.\nAppellant appealed to the Superior Court arguing, inter alia, that the Commonwealth had failed to meet its burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that appellant is an SVP because Humphreys was not qualified to testify that appellant had a mental abnormality. The Superior Court affirmed in an unpublished decision. The panel majority noted that Megan\u2019s Law II specifically lists \u201cpsychiatrists, psychologists and criminal justice experts each of whom is an expert in the field of the behavior and treatment of sexual offenders\u201d as individuals who could serve on the Board \u2014 and thus conduct SVP assessments and testify on the question of SVP classification.' See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9799.3. Because it was undisputed that Humphreys was a qualified criminal justice expert, the panel majority concluded that Humphreys could perform and testify to SVP assessments, including assessments regarding mental abnormality or personality disorder.\nPresident Judge Joseph A. Del Sole dissented, opining that Humphreys was not qualified to testify as an expert on SVP classification because, in the dissent\u2019s view, such an expert must make a \u201cdiagnosis\u201d of mental abnormality or personality disorder, which falls outside the expertise of a person who is not a licensed psychiatrist of psychologist. The dissent further argued that, while Humphreys was qualified as a criminal justice expert to be a member of the Board, the statutory scheme \u201cdoes not diminish or reduce the criteria for expert testimony by automatically qualifying a non-licensed psychologist or psychiatrist as an expert who can give a differential diagnosis on mental abnormality or personality disorder for purposes of the statute.\u201d Dissenting Memorandum at 2. Because the dissent construed Megan\u2019s Law II as requiring expert diagnostic testimony and no such valid expert testimony was presented in the case sub judice, the dissent concluded that the Commonwealth failed to establish that appellant was an SVP.\nOn this appeal, appellant begins by noting that Megan\u2019s Law II defines \u201cmental abnormality\u201d as: \u201cA congenital or acquired condition of a person that affects the emotional or volitional capacity of the person in a manner that predisposes that person to the commission of criminal sexual acts to a degree that makes the person a menace to the health and safety of other persons.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. 9792. The statute does not define \u201cpersonality disorder.\u201d Appellant argues that the triggering terms \u201cmental abnormality\u201d and \u201cpersonality disorder\u201d must be deemed to be psychological terms of art, thus requiring the testimony of a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist. Absent such qualified testimony, which is essential to any finding that an offender is an SVP, appellant argues, the Commonwealth fails to carry its burden of proof at an SVP hearing.\nIn support of his argument that only a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist may offer expert opinion testimony concerning mental abnormality or personality disorder, appellant cites to the Professional Psychologists Practice Act, 63 P.S. 1201-1218, noting that the Act provides that only a licensed individual may perform psychological assessments or render expert psychological testimony. Id. 1203. Appellant argues that as a matter of Pennsylvania law a witness who is not, at a minimum, licensed to practice psychology cannot render an expert opinion on such issues. As a result, appellant asserts that Humphreys was not properly qualified as an expert at the SVP hearing and that his testimony could not satisfy the Commonwealth\u2019s burden concerning the mental abnormality or personality disorder which is essential to concluding that an offender is an SVP. Appellant therefore requests that this Court vacate the SVP finding.\nThe Commonwealth counters that Megan\u2019s Law II expressly authorizes a criminal justice expert like Humphreys to conduct SVP assessments and to testify in court as to those assessments. The Commonwealth notes that appellant concedes that Humphreys is qualified to serve on the Board as a criminal justice expert and that Board members are specifically charged with the responsibility of conducting SVP assessments, which includes the inquiry into mental abnormality or personality disorder. Parenthetically, the Commonwealth also notes that the common law evidentiary standard for assessing the qualifications of expert witnesses \u201cis a liberal one:\u201d i.e. so long as the witness has \u201cany reasonable pretension to specialized knowledge of the subject under investigation\u201d \u2014 knowledge which may be gleaned from training and experience as well as from formal education \u2014 he may be permitted to testify in the discretion of the trial court. Brief of Appellee, 4, quoting Commonwealth v. Malseed, 847 A.2d 112, 114 (Pa.Super.2004), appeal denied, 580 Pa. 712, 862 A.2d 1254 (2004). Humphreys\u2019 education, training and experience, the Commonwealth argues, clearly qualified him to offer expert opinion testimony concerning whether appellant met the statutory criteria for classification as an SVP.\nThe Commonwealth also argues that the question of the admissibility of Humphreys\u2019 testimony on SVP status is governed by the statute; thus, Humphreys must be deemed qualified to offer the disputed testimony here, unless there was something in Megan\u2019s Law II itself that disqualified him. The Commonwealth contends that appellant misconstrues the statute as including such a disqualifying factor when he claims that it requires a \u201cclinical diagnosis\u201d or \u201cdifferential diagnosis\u201d by a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist regarding a mental abnormality that would make a person likely to engage in predatory sexual offenses. The Commonwealth notes that the SVP assessment contemplated under Megan\u2019s Law II does not require a clinical or differential diagnosis in the sense that such are typically conducted by psychiatrists and psychologists. Nor does the statute provide that licensed psychologists or psychiatrists are required to conduct the SVP assessments contemplated by Megan\u2019s Law II. To the contrary, the Commonwealth notes, such terms as SVP and mental abnormality as employed in Megan\u2019s Law II are not accepted medical or psychological terms; therefore, by definition, testimony from a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist was not contemplated in every evaluation. In addition, nothing in Megan\u2019s Law II requires that opinions respecting SVP classification be stated within a reasonable degree of medical certainty. In short, the Commonwealth contends, nothing in the statute suggests that a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist is particularly qualified, much less exclusively qualified, to testify to the statutory question of SVP classification, including the question of mental abnormality relating to the likelihood of sex offender recidivism. The Commonwealth summarizes its position on this point as follows: \u201cHumphreys is in the business of doing assessments to determine whether a sexual offender is likely to reoffend. Humphreys is not in the business of prescribing medicine or performing psychoanalysis and nothing contained in Megan\u2019s Law [II] requires him to be in such business.\u201d Brief of Appellee, 8.\nFinally, the Commonwealth disputes appellant\u2019s reliance upon the Professional Psychologists Practice Act. The Commonwealth notes that that Act itself recognizes that certain other professions may engage in work of a \u201cpsychological nature,\u201d and social workers are among those professionals specifically exempted. See 63 P.S. 1203(3) (\u201cNothing in this act shall be construed to prevent qualified members of other professions, including, but not limited to social workers from doing work of a psychological nature consistent with the training and code of ethics of their respective professions.\u201d). The Commonwealth also notes that later on in Title 63 (which addresses \u201cProfessions and Occupations\u201d), the General Assembly specifically addressed social workers in \u201cthe Social Workers\u2019 Practice Act.\u201d See 63 Pa.C.S.1901-1922. Section 1907 of this Act sets forth the requirements for licensure as a social worker. The Commonwealth then argues that Section 1903 defines the \u201cpractice of clinical social work\u201d in such a way as to make clear that it may include assessment of mental disorders:\nHolding oneself out to the public by any title or description of services incorporating the term \u201clicensed clinical social worker\u201d or using any words or symbols indicating or tending to indicate that one is a licensed clinical social worker and under such description offering to render or rendering a service in which a special knowledge of social resources, human personality and capabilities and therapeutic techniques is directed at helping people to achieve adequate and productive personal, interpersonal and social adjustments in their individual lives, in their families and in their community. The term includes person and environment perspectives, systems theory and cognitive/behavioral theory, to [sic] the assessment and treatment of psychosocial disability and impairment, including mental and emotional disorders, developmental disabilities and substance abuse. The term includes the application of social work methods and theory. The term includes the practice of social work plus additional concentrated training and study as defined by the board by regulation.\n63 P.S. \u00a7 1903 (emphasis added).\nIn addition to the parties\u2019 briefs, this Court has the benefit of an Amicus Curiae brief the Board has filed in support of the Commonwealth. The Board argues that it is important to recognize a distinction between what it terms a \u201cforensic assessment,\u201d which is what occurs in an SVP evaluation, and a \u201ctherapeutic assessment,\u201d which is what mental health professionals do when treating a person with a mental disorder. The Board argues that neither Megan\u2019s Law II nor the generally accepted practices of the various mental health professions direct that an expert must make a \u201cclinical diagnosis\u201d of personality disorder or mental illness in order to aid a court in the narrow task of determining statutory SVP status. The SVP evaluation does not seek to \u201cdiagnose\u201d a syndrome or set of symptoms, for treatment purposes, but rather the evaluation seeks to answer the statutory question of the offender\u2019s likelihood of engaging in predatory sexual violence. The Board further notes that the Act makes clear that the expertise at issue is \u201cin the field of the behavior and treatment of sexual offenders;\u201d not all psychiatrists or psychologists have such specific expertise. In making the assessment contemplated by the statute, the Board argues, the Board member applies non-clinical, statutory terms such as \u201cmental abnormality.\u201d In the Board\u2019s view, there is nothing in the Act or in the \u201cgenerally accepted practices of the mental health profession\u201d to preclude a Board member from conducting a nonclinical, non-diagnostic \u201cforensic assessment\u201d of an offender\u2019s \u201cpsychological attributes\u201d in order to determine whether he is an SVP. The Board further argues that the type of forensic assessment it makes \u201cis not novel or unprecedented, but rather is well supported by experts in the field of sex offender evaluation and treatment.\u201d Finally, the Board argues in the alternative that, even if the evaluator\u2019s testimony is deemed to comprise a clinical diagnosis rather than a forensic assessment, a licensed clinical social worker such as Humphreys is qualified to render such a diagnosis. In forwarding this alternative argument, the Board cites to decisions from the United States Supreme Court and several of our sister states which recognize that licensed clinical social workers may testify to a diagnosis of a mental disorder; and the Board also notes that thirty-three states and the District of Columbia have statutes defining social work or clinical social work as including the diagnosis or evaluation of mental disorders.\nAs a general matter, the question of whether a witness is qualified to testify as an expert is a matter resting in the discretion of the trial judge. E.g. Commonwealth v. Marinetti, 570 Pa. 622, 810 A.2d 1257, 1267 (2002). In this instance, however, the competence and relevance of the testimony primarily depends upon the proper interpretation of a statute. To the extent our inquiry focuses upon the meaning and application of the statute, this Court\u2019s review is plenary and non-deferential. E.g. MCI Worldcom, Inc. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm\u2019n, 577 Pa. 294, 844 A.2d 1239 (2004); Mosaica Academy Charter School v. Commonwealth, Department of Education, 572 Pa. 191, 813 A.2d 813 (2002).\nThe Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1501 et seq., provides that the object of interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1903(a), 1921(b). The statute\u2019s plain language generally provides the best indication of legislative intent. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Gilmour Manufacturing Co., 573 Pa. 143, 822 A.2d 676, 679 (2003); Bowser v. Blom, 569 Pa. 609, 807 A.2d 830, 835 (2002) (citations omitted); Pennsylvania Financial Responsibility Assigned Claims Plan v. English, 541 Pa. 424, 664 A.2d 84, 87 (1995) (\u201cWhere the words of a statute are clear and free from ambiguity the legislative intent is to be gleaned from those very words.\u201d). We will resort to other considerations to divine legislative intent only when the words of the statute are not explicit. 1 Pa.C.S.1921(b). See also Canvass of Absentee Ballots of November 4, 2003 General Election, 577 Pa. 231, 843 A.2d 1223, 1230 (2004) (citing O\u2019Rourke v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Corrections, 566 Pa. 161, 778 A.2d 1194, 1201 (2001)); Ramich v. Worker\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd. (Schatz Electric, Inc.), 564 Pa. 656, 770 A.2d 318, 322 (2001).\nThis appeal implicates the interplay of two sections of Megan\u2019s Law II, the provision dealing with SVP assessments, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9795.4, and the provision describing the Board. Id. \u00a7 9799.3. Section 9795.4(b) provides that, after the sentencing court refers a convicted offender for an assessment, \u201ca member of the board as designated by the administrative officer of the board shall conduct an assessment of the individual to determine if the individual should be classified as a sexually violent predator.\u201d That assessment is to be conducted according to standards for evaluation which the Board is to establish, and is to consider factors listed in Section 9795.4(b). Section 9799.3(a) then outlines what professionals are authorized to be members of the Board:\n(a) Composition. \u2014 The State Sexual Offenders Assessment Board shall be composed of psychiatrists, psychologists and criminal justice experts, each of whom is an expert in the field of the behavior and treatment of sexual offenders.\nId.\nThe term \u201ccriminal justice expert\u201d is not further defined in Megan\u2019s Law II, but that fact is of no moment for purposes of this appeal, as there is no dispute that Humphreys qualified as a criminal justice expert within the meaning of Section 9799.3. Notably, the legislation does not suggest that the different types of professionals approved for Board membership are to execute different functions peculiar to their professions. In other words, the statute does not say, or even suggest, that SVP assessments may only be performed by those on the Board who are psychiatrists or psychologists (with expertise in the behavior and treatment of sexual offenders). Nor does the statute suggest that opinions concerning an offenders\u2019 mental abnormality or personality disorder may only be rendered by a psychiatrist or psychologist. To the contrary, it appears from the plain language of the statute that the sole purpose of the Board is to provide SVP assessments, and it is equally apparent that the General Assembly contemplated that all members of the Board are to provide such assessments \u2014 whether the member be a psychiatrist, a psychologist, or a criminal justice expert. Accordingly, there is no question in our mind that the plain language of Megan\u2019s Law II authorizes a criminal justice expert such as Humphreys, who is an expert in the behavior and treatment of sexual offenders, to conduct the statutory SVP assessment, an assessment which encompasses an evaluation of whether the offender has \u201ca mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in predatory sexually violent offenses.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9792. In short, there is nothing in the statute to support appellant\u2019s argument that only a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist may testify to an expert opinion concerning those aspects of SVP status involving the offender\u2019s mental abnormality or personality disorder.\nAppellant argues, however, that there are considerations external to the plain language and structure of Megan\u2019s Law II that operate to prevent expert mental health-related testimony from Board member assessors who are not licensed psychiatrists or psychologists. Thus, appellant argues that the Professional Psychology Practice Act must be construed as barring a licensed clinical social worker such as Humphreys from offering an expert opinion on a sexual offender\u2019s mental state. But, the plain language of this Act makes clear that it imposes no such absolute bar, at least in the case of licensed social workers. Section 1203 provides that: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to engage in the practice of psychology or to offer or attempt to do so or to hold himself out to the public by any title or description of services incorporating the words \u2018psychological,\u2019 \u2018psychologist\u2019 or \u2018psychology\u2019 unless he shall first have obtained a license pursuant to this act.\u201d 63 P.S. 1203. As the Commonwealth has noted, however, the very same Section of that Act no less clearly recognizes that it is not intended to bar qualified members of other professions, including social workers, from engaging in work of a psychological nature which is consistent with the practice of those professions: \u201cNothing in this act shall be construed to prevent qualified members of other recognized professions, including, but not limited to, clergy, drug and alcohol abuse counselors, mental health counselors, social workers, marriage counselors, family counselors, crisis intervention counselors, pastoral counselors, rehabilitation counselors and psychoanalysts, from doing work of a psychological nature consistent with the training and the code of ethics of their respective professions or to prevent volunteers from providing services in crisis.\u201d 63 P.S. \u00a7 1203(3) (emphasis added).\nMoreover, the provisions of Title 63 which deal specifically with social workers (the \u201cSocial Workers\u2019 Practice Act,\u201d 63 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1922) corroborate the social worker exception carved out in the Professional Psychology Practice Act. Thus, Section 1903, which sets forth the parameters of the practice of clinical social work, provides that the practice of clinical social work includes: \u201cperson and environment perspectives, systems theory and cognitive/behavioral theory, to the assessment and treatment of psychosocial disability and impairment, including mental and emotional disorders, developmental disabilities and substance abuse.\u201d The plain language of this statute thus recognizes that clinical social workers have some expertise in the assessment of mental disorders.\nIn short, there is no tension between what Megan\u2019s Law II plainly authorizes and the licensing provisions in the Professional Psychology Practice Act. Other recognized professions, including social workers, are authorized to engage in work of a psychological nature that falls within their area of training. In this case, Humphreys testified that he has Bachelor\u2019s degrees in psychology and sociology and a Master\u2019s degree in social work. At the time of appellant\u2019s Megan\u2019s Law II hearing, Humphreys was a licensed clinical social worker with seventeen years of practical experience working with sex offenders, and the director of the sex offender program at Tri-County Human Services. Humphreys had provided expert testimony regarding sexual offender issues in many different courts, and testified at SVP hearings in Lackawanna, Susquehanna, Luzerne, Bradford and Wyoming Counties. He worked with several hundred sex offenders annually, performing approximately 12-20 SVP assessments per. year. His training and experience are such that he clearly fits within the exception specifically recognized in Section 1203(3) of the Professional Psychology Practice Act.\nFinally, we note that the underlying predicate of appellant\u2019s argument \u2014 ie., that the diagnostic standards which govern mental health professionals in other contexts exist as a non-textual restraint upon what is authorized by the legislative scheme adopted in Megan\u2019s Law II \u2014 echoes the Frye challenge which was forwarded in the Dengler case, and it must fail for similar reasons. The Dengler Court noted that the argument that expert testimony on SVP status \u201cdoes not square with prevailing standards and methodology in the psychological and psychiatric diagnostic communities\u201d \u201cmisses the mark\u201d because \u201c[t]he statute does not require proof of a standard of diagnosis that is commonly found and/or accepted in a mental health diagnostic paradigm.\u201d The Dengler Court stressed that, \u201c[i]n seeking to protect society against certain sexual offenders, the General Assembly was not obliged to adopt a certain diagnostic construct, and it is the construct that was actually adopted which must control this Court\u2019s analysis of the relevance and admissibility of evidence offered to prove the statutory standard.\u201d Dengler, 890 A.2d at 383. We further explained our reasoning as follows:\n[T]he \u201cscience\u201d here (and the SVP designation consequences it triggers) is responsive to, indeed it is a direct byproduct of, a specific legislatively-adopted scheme which sets forth the relevance and contours of the challenged evidence. The General Assembly has determined that a sexual offender\u2019s SVP status is significant to the operation of the registration and notification provisions of the law. The Assembly has defined the triggering term (\u201csexually violent predator\u201d) and has set forth the factors to be considered in making that determination. This scheme represents a legislative policy judgment concerning the proper response to certain sexual offenders. The question of SVP status is thus a statutory question, not a question of \u201cpure science\u201d and, at least in the absence of a challenge to the propriety of the substance of the statute, the question of evidentiary relevance is framed by the very provisions of the statute itself, not some external source.\nId.\nThe plain and clear statutory language permits a criminal justice expert such as the licensed clinical social worker in this case, who qualifies as an expert in the behavior and treatment of sexual offenders, to serve on the Board and to perform SVP assessments. Nothing in the statute requires such criminal justice expert to be a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist before he or she may render an expert opinion on the offender\u2019s mental state and the ultimate question of whether the offender is an SVP. Accordingly, we hold that, in order to carry its burden of proving that an offender is an SVP, the Commonwealth is not obliged to provide a clinical diagnosis by a licensed psychiatrist or psychologist; the opinion of a qualifying criminal justice expert suffices. The decision of the Superior Court, therefore, is affirmed.\nChief Justice CAPPY, Justice NEWMAN and Justice SAYLOR and EAKIN join the opinion.\nFormer Justice NIGRO did not participate in the decision of this matter.\nJustice BAER files a concurring opinion.\nJustice BAER, concurs.\nIn Commonwealth v. Dengler, 890 A.2d 372 (Pa.2005), I concurred in the result but declined to join the Court\u2019s rationale because I found flaw in\n\u201cthose aspects of the Majority Opinion that suggest that a statute setting forth factors to gird a particular scientific inquiry in itself relieves a court from conducting an independent analysis under [Frye v. United States, 293 F. 1013 (D.C.Cir.1923),] of the novelty of a given theory or method used to address those factors.\u201d\nId. at 385 (Baer, J., concurring). In writing separately, I noted that the Court\u2019s opinion in that case was amenable of more than one interpretation, and emphasized that I distanced myself only from that interpretation that would permit the legislature to preempt by statute a trial court\u2019s independent, discretionary assessment of the novelty of the methodology underlying given expert testimony. In the case sub judice, the Majority vindicates my fears, citing Dengler as authority for the removal from the trial courts of their traditional discretion independently to consider the qualifications of a given expert witness in favor of a broadly worded statute and the self-policing of an administrative body. As in Dengler, I believe a far more limited basis for reaching the same result is available to the Court, and I would resolve the case on that rationale.\nThe Majority correctly observes that \u201cthe question of whether a witness is qualified to testify as an expert is a matter resting in the discretion of the trial judge.\u201d Maj. Op. 587 Pa. at 151, 897 A.2d at 1174 (citing Commonwealth v. Marinetti, 570 Pa. 622, 810 A.2d 1257, 1267 (2002)). Thus, as the Court recognized in Dengler, we evaluate trial courts\u2019 determinations regarding the admissibility of evidence by an abuse of discretion standard. Dengler, 890 A.2d at 379. Accordingly, we will disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling only where that ruling reflects \u201cmanifest unreasonableness, or partiality, prejudice, bias, or ill-will, or such lack of support so as to be clearly erroneous.\u201d Id. (quoting Grady v. Frito-Lay, Inc., 576 Pa. 546, 839 A.2d 1038, 1046 (2003)) (internal quotation marks omitted). Having so established this standard in both cases, however, the Majority proceeds unaccountably to sanction the legislature\u2019s evisceration of trial court discretion and replace it with the legislature\u2019s own standardized criteria \u2014 criteria that amount to a yes or no checklist that, once satisfied, compels a trial judge to admit a given expert regardless of any case-specific peculiarities that call into question the wisdom or utility of doing so.\nTo be clear, I do not believe this case presents difficult facts. I agree with the Majority that social workers are not, by virtue of that credential, precluded from testifying as to a sex offender\u2019s status as a sexually violent predator (SVP). I take no issue in principle with the legislature\u2019s prerogative to establish such criteria, and agree that there is a \u201cforensic\u201d component as well as a \u201cclinical\u201d component to an SVP assessment. I do not object to the statutory creation of the Sexual Offender Assessment Board (Board), or its performance, through its members, of the tasks assigned it by statute. Finally, I agree that the social worker who testified in this case was eminently qualified to testify regarding Appellant\u2019s SVP status.\nI cannot agree, however, that a member of the Board is, as a function of that membership, presumptively qualified to testify in a given case as to whether an offender is an SVP, and I do not believe it is the place of the legislature or an administrative agency to impose such a rule at the expense of trial court discretion. Although I view the Board\u2019s current membership criteria as salutary and likely to result in a Board composed of qualified criminal justice experts in the relevant disciplines competent to testify as to offenders\u2019 SVP status, I find cause for concern that those criteria were established by the Board for the Board, and that nothing in the law as presently constituted precludes the Board from lowering its bar to membership. Moreover, although I believe that the vast majority of individuals who satisfy the current criteria for Board membership will satisfy any trial court of their qualifications to testify as to offenders\u2019 SVP statuses, I have no trouble imagining an individual who satisfies these criteria and yet reasonably may be found unqualified to testify in a given case. According to the Board\u2019s own criteria, a person would be qualified to sit on the Board and conduct the assessments here in question with only two semesters of academic work and approximately one year of research regarding sex offenders. Even if the criteria were self-evidently exhaustive of all any trial court might reasonably demand of an expert witness, however, that would not vitiate my concern that the Board might, at any time, change its criteria to admit less qualified individuals to its membership. Under the present scheme, the only meaningful hedge against such an eventuality is to preserve trial court discretion to assess each proffered expert on his or her individual merits.\nRegarding the narrow question presented, I would find that our legislature, acting well within its province, has made clear the intuitive proposition that social workers, whose professional work often involves counseling sex offenders and others, may be qualified to make diagnoses and assessments of the sort necessary in the SVP assessment context. In fact, I adopt in full the Majority\u2019s discussion of the general qualification of social workers to testify regarding SVP status. But expert witnesses, in being identified as such, exercise a powerful and potentially prejudicial influence over juries, and trial judges are best situated to ensure that the title \u201cexpert witness\u201d is not abused.\nThe Majority notes that Megan\u2019s Law II \u201cdoes not say, or even suggest, that SVP assessments may only be performed by those on the Board who are psychiatrists or psychologists (with expertise in the treatment of sexual offenders).\u201d Maj. Op. 587 Pa. at 154, 897 A.2d at 1176. Thus, the Majority finds that the legislature did not intend to exclude social workers, generally, from conducting SVP assessments. As I have already noted, I find no quibble with this proposition. But neither does the statute say, nor even suggest, that the legislature intended, with Megan\u2019s Law II, to vitiate the trial court\u2019s discretion to reject a particular individual proffered as an expert witness, notwithstanding that he satisfies broadly stated legislative or administrative criteria, because the trial judge finds in his or her discretion that the witness is not qualified to testify under the peculiar circumstance of the witness\u2019s own background and experience and the facts of the case in question.\n\u25a0 I agree, for the narrow reasons acknowledged by the Majority, that the expert in this case was qualified to testify as to his assessment of Appellant\u2019s SVP status, and thus I would affirm the lower courts\u2019 rulings to that effect. I disagree, however, that such a ruling needs come at the expense of the time-honored trial court function of discriminating among witnesses and evidence to discern what is fit for consideration 'in his or her courtroom. I do not believe that a trial judge, in some future case, would ipso facto abuse his or her discretion by declining to admit the testimony of a person who had attained membership on the Board for want of some qualifying element. Unfortunately, I believe that the Majority\u2019s analysis will bind us to precisely that result.\n.

This Court has described the operation of Megan\u2019s Law II in some detail in both Dengler, see 890 A.2d at 374-75 & nn. 2 & 3 and Commonwealth v. Williams, 832 A.2d 962, 965-968 & nn. 6, 8-12 (2003). For purposes of deciding the narrow question accepted for review here, we need not repeat that description.\n. Appellant raised three other issues: whether the trial court erred in (1) permitting the Children\u2019s Advocacy Center\u2019s medical director to testify regarding the child\u2019s specific allegations of sexual conduct where the statements were not necessary fdr treatment, (2) denying appellant the opportunity to present testimony regarding the child\u2019s reputation for truthfulness, and (3) fining appellant without regard to his ability to pay or the effect the fines would have on his ability to pay restitution. None of these issues were included in this Court\u2019s limited grant of review, and thus we do not pass upon them.\n. Malseed!s characterization of the governing law in this area is in accord with this Court\u2019s controlling authority. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Marinelli, 570 Pa. 622, 810 A.2d 1257, 1267 (2002). See also Pa.R.E. 702 (\"Testimony by experts\u201d) (\u201cIf scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge beyond that possessed by a layperson will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d); Dengler, 890 A.2d at 380.\n. In his Statement of the Scope and Standard of Review, appellant states that the issue presented concerns the sufficiency of the evidence to prove he should be classified as an SVP. In response, the Commonwealth notes that appellant\u2019s actual argument is confined to a claim that Humphreys was unqualified to render the expert opinion he gave, an issue involving the admissibility of evidence. The issue, which was specifically framed in this Court's order granting review, implicates the admissibility of the proffered testimony under the statute, and not sufficiency. The distinction is not academic; a successful sufficiency challenge can lead to an outright grant of relief (in this case, a reversal of the SVP designation), while a successful evidentiary challenge presumably would result in a remand for another hearing at which the challenged evidence would not be admissible. Moreover, casting the issue as sufficiency review is a non sequitir: in conducting a sufficiency review, this Court would have to accept the record of the case as actually litigated, which would include Humphreys' evidence, and not as diminished by evidence deemed, after the fact, to have been wrongly admitted. See Commonwealth v. Hall, 574 Pa. 233, 830 A.2d 537, 542 n. 2 (2003); Commonwealth v. Lovette, 498 Pa. 665, 450 A.2d 975 (1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1178, 103 S.Ct. 830, 74 L.Ed.2d 1025 (1983) .\n. The factors listed in Section 9795.4(b) are:\n(1) Facts of the current offense, including:\n(i) Whether (he offense involved multiple victims.\n(ii) Whether (he individual exceeded the means necessary to achieve the offense.\n(iii) The nature of the sexual contact with the victim.\n(iv) Relationship of the individual to the victim.\n(v) Age of the victim.\n(vi) Whether the offense included a display of unusual cruelty by the individual during the commission of the crime.\n(vii) The mental capacity of the victim.\n(2) Prior offense history, including:\n(i) The individual's prior criminal record.\n(ii) Whether the individual completed any prior sentences.\n(iii) Whether the individual participated in available programs for sexual offenders.\n(3) Characteristics of the individual, including:\n(i) Age of the individual.\n(ii) Use of illegal drugs by the individual.\n(iii) Any mental illness, mental disability or mental abnormality.\n(iv) Behavioral characteristics that contribute to the individual\u2019s conduct.\n(4) Factors that are supported in a sexual offender assessment field as criteria reasonably related to the risk of reoffense.\nId. \u00a7 9795.4(b).\n. In its amicus brief, the Board notes that it has administratively defined a criminal justice expert as an individual with a Master\u2019s degree or higher in social work, counseling, criminology, human sexuality or criminal justice. In addition, Board members must have a minimum of 2000 hours of experience with sex offenders through direct service, education, research or supervision. Brief of Amicus at 9 & Appendix A. Humphreys apparently met these criteria.\n. For purposes of considering appellant's argument, we will assume that the evaluation and expert opinion rendered by Humphreys implicated the practice of psychology. See 63 P.S. \u00a7 1202 (defining practice of psychology).\n. We recognize that Megan\u2019s Law II speaks in terms of \"criminal justice experts\u2019\u2019 who are \"expert in the field of the behavior and treatment of sexual offenders,\" and not in terms of licensed social workers. Notably, however, the exceptions specifically set forth in the Professional Psychology Practice Act are illustrative and not exhaustive (i.e., \"including but not limited to ...\u201d). Both statutes, then, are written in flexible terms; a criminal justice expert may be, but need not necessarily be, a licensed social worker.\n. The Concurring Opinion by Mr. Justice Baer expresses concern with a hypothetical situation: i.e., would the trial court have discretionary power to grant a defense motion to bar the expert testimony of an approved SVP evaluator on grounds that, although the evaluator is an approved member of the. Board, he lacks the requisite qualifications either as a general matter or in light of the particular case. Respectfully, this appeal presents no such hypothetical challenge and, contrary to the concurrence\u2019s expression of concern, we have rendered no decision on that or any other hypothetical situation. Nothing in this Opinion exists as a bar to a defendant seeking to challenge the qualifications of a proffered Board-approved SVP expert evaluator in a particular case. What is at issue here is whether the Commonwealth may present an otherwise qualified SVP expert evaluator in the face of an objection, external to the statute, that the expert is neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist; we hold that it can. Moreover, we emphasize that the question here is one of bare qualification and admissibility; the ultimate determination of SVP status is made by the trial judge, who is not obliged to accept the SVP evaluator's expert opinion. The sorts of concerns animating the concurrence are always available in impeaching and arguing the merit and persuasiveness of the evaluator's substantive opinion.\n. I share the Majority's view that this case presents a challenge to the admissibility, rather than the sufficiency of the evidence. See Maj. Op. 587 Pa. at 152, 897 A.2d at 1175 n. 12.\n. As noted by the Majority, Maj. Op. 587 Pa. at 154, 897 A.2d at 1176 n. 14, the Board has administratively defined \u201ccriminal justice expert\u2019\u2019 for purposes of qualifying individuals to serve on the Board as someone with at least a Master's degree in social work, counseling, criminology, human sexuality, or criminal justice, and a minimum of 2000 hours of experience with sex offenders through direct service, education, research, or supervision.\n. For this reason, I reject the Majority's suggestion that the absence of a definition for \u201ccriminal justice expert\u2019\u2019 in Megan's Law II is \u201cof no moment\u201d simply because the witness in this case is undisputedly qualified. See Maj. Op. 587 Pa. at 154, 897 A.2d at 1176. First, there is circularity here, no matter how intuitive it is that the witness in this case is qualified. Second, this observation by the Majority would be far more agreeable had it chosen to decide this case on the narrow grounds of one witness\u2019s qualifications. Instead, however, the Majority effectively cedes to an administrative agency that is not directly accountable to the electorate the prerogative to change its criteria at will. Had the legislature seen fit to define this term with some particularity, one would be entitled to the comfort that its modification would require the subscription of a majority of legislators, each directly accountable to the electorate. As it stands, however, a wholly unaccountable body has full discretion to define who is qualified to render testimony that may subject an offender to a lifetime of onerous registration and counseling requirements and harsh penalties should he or she fail to comply."}
