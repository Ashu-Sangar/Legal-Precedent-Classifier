{"id": "1908640", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nThis appeal involves the triennial assessment for the years 1963, 1964 and 1965 of the property owned by the Regional Industrial Development Corporation of Southwestern Pennsylvania and Eazor Express, Inc. (Owners). The Board of Property Assessment, Appeals and Review of Allegheny County (Board) placed an assessed value of $389,455 on the property.\nBefore the court below the Board placed the assessment in evidence and rested. The owners then produced a recognized real estate expert as a witness. This witness testified that the fair market value of the property was $380,000. The owners also produced an employe of Eazor Express, Inc., who testified that his company had entered into a contract in 1962 to purchase the property from the Development Corporation for the sum of $530,000. Under the contract Eazor had the right to demolish the buildings on the premises and, in fact, did so prior to January 1, 1963.\nThe Board then called one of its sub-assessors and its vice-chairman as witnesses. Both testified generally in support of the assessment without actually testifying as to the fair market value of the property.\nThe court (in its words) \u201caccorded much weight to the sale and the selling price of $530,000\u201d and determined that the fair market value of the property was $500,000. It then took cognizance of the Richman study concerning the ratio of assessed values to market values throughout Allegheny County which had been incorporated into the evidence in this case, determined that the common level of assessments in the county for the triennium was \u00e1\u00e1% and reduced the above fair market value to $220,000 (44% of $500,000). The Board filed exceptions and requested argument before the court en banc. This request was refused and the exceptions dismissed. The Board appealed.\nThe Board argues that the prima facie validity of the original assessment ($389,455) was not overcome because the court below \u201cobviously\u201d (according to the Board) rejected the testimony of the owners\u2019 expert witness in arriving at a value of $500,000. Therefore, maintains the Board, this witness\u2019 testimony on uniformity was similarly rejected, and the original assessment, unequalized, must stand.\nWe follow the Board\u2019s argument only with the greatest difficulty. The lower court clearly applied an equalization factor here based upon the aforementioned Rickman study. This was proper, and if applied to the original assessment, this study would reduce the assessed value well below the value set by the court. Therefore, even if we assume that the testimony of the owners\u2019 witness ivas rejected by the court below, the Richman study would be applicable to the Board\u2019s assessment.\nIn short, the Board has fared well here, and since the owners have not appealed from the court\u2019s determination of market value, we see no reason to discuss this aspect of the case further.\nThe order of the court below is affirmed.\nMr. Justice Eagbn dissents.\nSee our opinion handed down this day in Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company Tax Assessment Case, 426 Pa. 566."}
