{"id": "1017011", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal is from an order directing judgment to be entered on a bond more than twenty years old. The circumstances under which the appellant gave it are concisely stated in the opinion of the court ordering the judgment to be entered. If the bond had not been more than twenty years old, the right of the appellee would have been to enter judgment on it without an order of the court permitting her to do so; and nothing appeared in the answer of the appellant to the petition for leave to enter the judgment which would have justified the court\u2019s denial of the order prayed for. For what amount, if any, the appellant may be actually liable on the judgment can be determined only after the Orphans\u2019 Court has made a decree distributing the estate of her father. If she has not received more than a child\u2019s share \u2022in it, there will be no liability on the judgment.\nAppeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
