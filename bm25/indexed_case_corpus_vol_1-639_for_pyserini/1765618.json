{"id": "1765618", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Justice.\nBoth of these appeals present the question of the extent of benefits available under the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act to the survivors of persons fatally injured in automobile accidents. For the reasons that follow, we will sustain the orders of the Superior Court.\nI.\nThe husband of appellee, Delores Heffner, was killed when the car he was driving struck a utility pole. No other vehicles or persons were involved in this accident. The deceased was the holder of an Allstate Motor Vehicle Insuranee Policy which provided him with coverage in accordance with the No-Fault Act. Appellee Heffner applied for benefits under the decedent\u2019s Allstate insurance policy, seeking to recover funeral expenses, \u201csurvivor\u2019s loss\u201d benefits, and \u201cwork loss\u201d benefits. These latter two categories are statutorily defined benefits under the Act, and will be discussed below. Appellant, Allstate Insurance Company, agreed to pay both the funeral expenses and the survivor\u2019s loss benefits, but denied recovery on the work loss benefits claim. Appellee Heffner subsequently filed a complaint in assumpsit against Allstate seeking to recover the work loss benefits. The Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County entered an order granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of Allstate, thereby denying appellee Heffner\u2019s claim. The Superior Court reversed the Court of Common Pleas, 265 Pa. Super. 181, 401 A.2d 1160 (1979), holding that work loss benefits were available to Mrs. Heffner. We granted Allstate\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal pursuant to 42 Pa.C. S.A. \u00a7 724.\nAppellee Homer Pontius is the administrator of the estate of Janet A. Pontius, who was killed in an automobile accident. The decedent was insured under an automobile policy issued by appellant, United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (USF&G), in accordance with the No-Fault Act. USF&G paid the statutory \u201csurvivor\u2019s loss\u201d benefits to the qualifying survivors, but rejected the estate\u2019s claim for \u201cwork loss\u201d benefits under the Act. The estate brought suit in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County seeking work loss benefits. That court sustained USF&G\u2019s preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer to the complaint. 100 Dauphin 133 (1978). The Superior Court reversed in an unreported opinion, based solely upon its opinion in the Heffner case. We granted USF&G\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal and consolidated argument on this case with that on Heffner.\nII.\nThis Court must start from the position that its duty \u201cis to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly,\u201d so that full effect is given to every provision of a statute, if possible. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a) (1980-81 pamphlet).\nIn enacting the No-Fault Act, the General Assembly expressly declared that \u201cthe maximum feasible restoration of all individuals injured and compensation of the economic losses of the survivors of all individu\u00e1is killed in motor vehicle accidents on Commonwealth highways, ... is essential to the humane and purposeful functioning of commerce.\u201d 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.102(a)(3) (emphasis added). Furthermore, \u201cit is hereby declared to be the policy of the General Assembly to establish ... a statewide system of prompt and adequate basic loss benefits for motor vehicle accident victims and the survivors of deceased victims,\u201d 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.102(b) (emphasis added). The legislature has provided definitions for the terms with which we must interpret the No-Fault Act. The following definitions contained in Article I are required in order to resolve the issue presently before us:\n\u201cAllowable expenses\u201d means reasonable charges incurred for, or the reasonable value of (where no charges are incurred), reasonably needed and used products, services, and accommodations for:\n(A) professional medical treatment and care;\n(B) emergency health services;\n(C) medical and vocational rehabilitation services;\n(D) expenses directly related to the funeral, burial, cremation, or other form of disposition of the remains of a deceased victim, not to exceed one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500); and\nThe term does not include that portion of a charge for a room in a hospital, clinic, convalescent, or nursing home, or any other institution engaged in providing nursing care, and related services, in excess of a reasonable and customary charge for semiprivate accommodations, unless more intensive care is medically required; or any amount includable in work loss, replacement services loss, or surviv- or\u2019s loss.\n\u201cBasic loss benefits\u201d means benefits provided in accordance with this act for the net loss sustained by a victim, subject to any applicable limitations, exclusions, deductibles, waiting periods, disqualifications, or other terms and conditions provided or authorized in accordance with this act. Basic loss benefits do not include benefits for damage to property. Nor do basic loss benefits include benefits for net loss sustained by an operator or passenger of a motorcycle.\ns[c \u2021 sfc sjs sfc\n\u201cInjury\u201d means accidentally sustained bodily harm to an individual and that individual\u2019s illness, disease, or death resulting therefrom.\nSfc sfs Sji SfC 8ft !ji\n\u201cLoss\u201d means accrued economic detriment resulting from injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle consisting of, and limited to, allowable expense, work loss, replacement services loss, and survivor\u2019s loss.\n* * * * * He\n\u201cReplacement services loss\u201d means expenses reasonably incurred in obtaining ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those the victim would have performed, not for income, but for the benefit of himself or his family, if he had not been injured.\n* * * * * *\n\u201cSurvivoimeans:\n(A) spouse; or\n(B) child, parent, brother, sister or relative dependent upon the deceased for support.\n\u201cSurvivor\u2019s loss\u201d means the:\n(A) loss of income of a deceased victim which would probably have been contributed to a survivor or survivors, if such victim had not sustained the fatal injury; and\n(B) expenses reasonably incurred by a survivor or survivors, after a victim\u2019s death resulting from injury, in obtaining ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those which the victim would have performed, not for income, but for their benefit, if he had not sustained the fatal injury, reduced by expenses which the survivor or survivors would probably have incurred but avoided by reason of the victim\u2019s death resulting from injury.\n\u201c Victim\u201d means an individual who suffers injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle; \u201cdeceased victim\u201d means a victim suffering death resulting from injury.\n* \u2022* * * * *\n\u201cWork los\u00e9\u2019 means:\n(A) loss of gross income of a victim, as calculated pursuant to the provisions of section 205 of this act; and\n(B) reasonable expenses of a victim for hiring a substitute to perform self-employment services, thereby mitigating loss of income, or for hiring special help, thereby enabling a victim to work and mitigate loss, of income.\n40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.103. (Emphasis added.)\nArticle II of the Act establishes the right to benefits and imposes monetary ceilings on the amount of benefits recoverable. Specifically, Section 201, in pertinent part, confers the right to receive basic loss benefits to \u201cany victim or any survivor of a deceased victim,\u201d if the accident resulting in injury occurs within the Commonwealth. Section 202 enumerates the four types of basic loss benefits as well as their monetary limits: a) allowable expense limits, including reasonable professional medical treatment and care, emergency health services, medical and vocational rehabilitation services; and funeral expenses; b) work loss benefits ($15,000 maximum); c) replacement services losses ($25 per day for one year); and d) survivors losses ($5,000 maximum). Section 205, in turn, establishes the method for determining the amount of work loss benefits. The Act requires that benefits be paid monthly as loss accrues. \u201cLoss accrues not when injury occurs, but as allowable expenses, work loss, replacement services loss, or survivor\u2019s loss is sustained.\u201d\nIII.\nThe crux of the issue presented to us is whether the legislature intended \u201cvictims\u201d of motor vehicle accidents to be accorded differing basic loss benefits from those accorded survivors of \u201cdeceased victims.\u201d Appellants, Allstate and USF&G, contend that the legislature did intend such a distinction. On the one hand, appellants assert that \u201cvictims\u201d are entitled to the following basic loss benefits: allowable expense, work loss, and replacement services loss. On the other hand, appellants maintain survivors of \u201cdeceased victims\u201d are only entitled to: allowable expense (funeral expenses) and survivor\u2019s loss. This view has been adopted by four different courts of common pleas but was rejected by the Superior Court in the two cases presently before us.\nAppellants support their position by referring to the definition of \u201cvictim\u201d contained in section 103. Appellants assert that section 103 differentiates between \u201cvictims\u201d and \u201cdeceased victims.\u201d These terms are defined in the same paragraph which states:\n\u201cVictim\u201d means an individual who suffers injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle; \u201cdeceased victim\u201d means a victim suffering death resulting from injury.\n40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.103\nBy prpviding separate definitions for \u201cvictim\u201d and \u201cdeceased victim,\u201d appellants argue that the legislature intended to create two classifications of beneficiaries for purposes of different basic loss benefits.\nFurthermore, appellants point out that section 103\u2019s definition of \u201cwork loss\u201d mentions only the term \u201cvictim\u201d and fails to mention either the term \u201csurvivor\u201d or \u201cdeceased victim.\u201d By failing to include \u201cdeceased victim\u201d within the definition of \u201cwork loss,\u201d appellants argue that the legislature intended to provide work loss benefits only to victims who did not die as a result of their injuries.\nIn its Heffner opinion, the Superior Court rejected Allstate\u2019s claim that the legislature intended to create two separate and distinct classes of beneficiaries under the Act. After subjecting the proffered \u201cvictim-deceased victim\u201d dichotomy to a searching analysis, the Superior Court found it wanting:\nOf course, recalling the sentiment with which we began our discussion of the No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, it is not surprising to learn that Allstate\u2019s argument is cogent so long as one ignores contrary signs of guidance in the Act. For example, as we stated above, in its preamble the Act exclaims its purpose to be, inter alia, \u201cthe maximum feasible restoration of all individuals injured and compensation of the economic losses of the survivors of all individuals killed in motor vehicle accidents on Commonwealth highways. . . . \u201d Historically, the courts of this Commonwealth have routinely followed this spirit and found coverage for the insured in close or doubtful insurance cases. The tendency has been that if we should err in ascertaining the intent of the legislature or the intendment of an insurance policy, we should err in favor of coverage for the insured. Obviously, to adopt Allstate\u2019s interpretation of the Act in the instant case is to give less than generous application to that principle. In addition, although Allstate directed our attention to the definitional dichotomy of \u201cvictim-deceased victim\u201d which the Act creates, it has overlooked the impact of the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cinjury.\u201d Section 103 provides: \u201c \u2018Injury\u2019 means accidentally sustained bodily harm to an individual and that individual\u2019s illness, disease, or death resulting therefrom.\u201d [Emphasis added.] Because the Act specifically defines the term \u201cinjury,\u201d for the purposes of construing the Act, \u201cinjury\u201d is a term of art to which we should ascribe precisely the meaning the Act gives it. As one might expect when he analyzes the No-Fault Act, this interpretational truism creates another paradox, a nettlesome impediment for Allstate\u2019s position. True, the Act has differentiated victims from deceased victims, but it has not differentiated injuries from fatal injuries. The result is that some sections of the Act which Allstate insists apply only to non-fatal injuries are not so limited by their terms. For example, Section 103 of the Act defines \u201cLoss\u201d as the \u201caccrued economic detriment resulting from injury .. . consisting of, and limited to, allowable expense, work loss, replacement services loss, and survivor\u2019s loss.\u201d [Emphasis added.] Since injury means death, as well as non-fatal injury, Section 103 can be read to mean that work loss is an accrued economic detriment resulting from death. This implication is fortified by Section 206 of the Act which, in attempting to define \u201cnet loss,\u201d provides that life insurance proceeds are not to be subtracted from loss in calculating the net loss available to an individual because of injury.\nId., 265 Pa.Super. at 186-188, 401 A.2d at 1162-63 (footnotes omitted, emphasis in original).\nAppellants\u2019 \u201cvictim-deceased victim\u201d dichotomy has also been rejected in a recent treatise that thoroughly examined the Pennsylvania No-Fault Act:\nIt may be urged that the legislature intended that \u201cdeceased victim\u201d would merely be a sub-class of \u201cvictim\u201d according to the definitions of the Act and not a separate species of claimants to be treated differently. The legislature specified that \u201cdeceased victim means a victim,\u201d while it states that \u201cvictim means an individual.\u201d Surely, if the legislature had intended to separate \u201cvictim\u201d and \u201cdeceased victim,\u201d it would have placed \u201cdeceased victim\u201d in its own category in the definitional section (Section 103) in alphabetical order and then it could readily have stated \u201ca deceased victim is an individual.\u201d\nEven in the definition of \u201csurvivor\u2019s loss,\u201d the legislature treats a deceased victim merely as another category of victim. In fact, the terms are used almost interchangeably in Section 103.\n\u201c \u2018Survivor\u2019s loss\u2019 means the:\n(A) loss of income of a deceased victim which would probably have been contributed to a survivor or survivors, if such victim had not sustained the fatal injury; and\n(B) expenses reasonably incurred by a survivor or survivors, after a victim\u2019s death resulting from injury, in obtaining ordinary and necessary services in lieu of those which the victim would have performed, not for income, but for their benefit, if he had not sustained the fatal injury, reduced by expenses which the survivor or survivors would probably have incurred but avoided by reason of the victim\u2019s death resulting from injury.\u201d\nYet other sections of the No-fault Act, including Sections 110(b), 110(c) and 111(a), use the terms \u201cvictim\u201d and \u201cdeceased victim\u201d interchangeably.\nD. Shrager, ed., The Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, 109-110 (1979). (Emphasis in the original.)\nFinally, in Heffner, the Superior Court noted that the No-fault automobile insurance laws of several sister states have all expressly denied work loss benefits to the survivors of deceased victims. For instance, Colorado\u2019s No-Fault Act expressly states that \u201cdisability benefits . . . shall not accrue following the death of the injured person.\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 10 \u2014 4\u2014706(l)(d)(II) (1974). The Connecticut statute specifically notes, \u201cwork loss does not include any loss after the death of an injured person\u201d Conn.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 38 \u2014 319(b)(2)(ii) (1977). The Michigan statute likewise unequivocally states: \u201cwork loss does not include any loss after the date on which the injured person dies.\u201d Mich.Comp.L.Ann. \u00a7 500.3107(b) (Supp.1978). See also: Nev.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 698.070(5) (1977); NJ.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 39: 6A-4(b) (1973); N.Y. Insurance Law \u00a7 671.1(c) (McKinney Supp.1978); N.D.Cent.Code \u00a7 26-41-03(21) (1978). If our legislature had intended to establish different benefits for victims and survivors of deceased victims under the Act, it would have done so in an equally clear and lucid fashion.\nAppellants also contend that providing work loss benefits in addition to survivor\u2019s loss benefits to the survivors of deceased victims will result in overlapping coverage and double payments. \u201cSurvivor\u2019s loss\u201d, in pertinent part, is defined as \u201closs of income of a deceased victim which would probably have been contributed to a survivor or survivors.... \u201d \u201cWork loss\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as \u201closs of gross income of a victim. ...\u201d Because benefits available under \u201csurvivor\u2019s loss\u201d and \u201cwork loss\u201d overlap in that each includes that portion of the deceased\u2019s income as would have been contributed to support his family and dependents, appellants argue that they would be forced to pay twice for the same items of damage or loss. Thus appellants seek to limit the survivors of a deceased victim to the $5,000 ceiling amount of survivors\u2019 loss in section 202(d) and would deny all work loss benefits in section 202(b).\nAlthough the Superior Court in Heffner recognized the possibility of a double recovery by survivors of a deceased victim, it found that there were more substantial societal benefits to be gained by risking that possibility:\nThus, the Act leaves us in a quandary. To adopt appellant\u2019s argument is to create the likelihood of overlapping or double recoveries for survivors of deceased victims, as well as to compensate them for expenses which were not incurred (e. g., support for a victim who did not survive an accident). On the other hand, to accept Allstate\u2019s argument is to ignore countervailing, albeit equivocal, indications that the Act permits such recoveries, and to sublimate the longstanding principle that insurance contracts, as well as remedial legislation relating thereto, should be construed liberally in favor of the insured.\n265 Pa.Super. at 188, 401 A.2d at .1163\nThe possibility of double or overlapping recovery by allowing survivors of deceased victims to recover work loss benefits is disputed in the Shrager treatise on the state No-Fault Act. In discussing the Superior Court\u2019s opinion in Heffner, it states:\nTo what extent does the Heffner case permit double recovery for survivor\u2019s loss and work losses? The Court unnecessarily seems to assume the likelihood of overlapping recoveries. Section 103 defines \u201cwork loss\u201d to include a determination of the accident victim\u2019s \u201cgross income.\u201d \u201cSurvivor\u2019s loss\u201d is defined to include \u201closs of [the very same] income which would probably have been contributed to a survivor or survivors.\u201d\nYet, it is probable that the courts will have little difficulty in intermeshing these two forms of basic loss benefits in order to avoid any windfall. In the case of work loss, as already discussed, the Act is simply providing a certain measure of Survival Act damage, on a no-fault basis. The amount will then neatly coordinate with recovery of any excess amount in a tort action under Section 301(a)(4). Similarly, with respect to so much of survivor\u2019s loss recovery as represents contributions to survivors, this is simply no-fault wrongful death recovery. There is in fact no duplication of recovery in the same sense that third-party recovery in a wrongful death and survival claim involve different economic loss claims. They do not overlap.\nIf, for example, a decedent has an earnings loss net of cost of maintenance of $100,000.00 over the balance of his work-life expectancy, $15,000.00 will be recoverable as \u201cwork loss\u201d and $5,000.00 will be recoverable as \u201csurviv- or\u2019s loss.\u201d The $80,000.00 balance of economic loss must be sought in a tort action.\nD. Shrager, ed., supra at 112.\nEven assuming such potential for double recovery, this fact, in and of itself, does not necessarily evidence a legislative intention to deny \u201cwork loss\u201d benefits to survivors. As appellee Pontius points out in his brief, the legislature has allowed double recovery of other benefits under the Act. For example section 203 of the Act concerning Collateral Benefits permits victims to recover their medical expenses from Blue Cross and Blue Shield and then recover the same expenses a second time from the no-fault carrier. It is apparent that the \u201cvice\u201d of double recovery was not foremost in the minds of the legislators when the No-Fault Act was enacted. Consequently, the mere possibility of a double recovery by granting \u201cwork loss\u201d benefits to survivors of deceased victims, does not seem contrary to either the express or implied intention of the legislature.\nHowever, we believe that in practice, recovery of surviv- or\u2019s loss and work loss benefits by survivors of deceased victims, will no more constitute double recovery under the Act than does recovery under analogous wrongful death and survival actions in tort law. See Pezzulli v. D\u2019Ambrosia, 344 Pa. 643, 26 A.2d 659 (1942); First Nat. Bank of Meadvilie, Pa. v. Niagra Therapy Mfg. Corp., 229 F.Supp. 460 (W.D.Pa. 1964); and Hochrein v. United States, 238 F.Supp. 317 (E.D.Pa.1965). As we view the Act, the decedent\u2019s contribution of income under survivor\u2019s loss recovery shall be excluded from the amount recovered under work loss. In this manner, both basic loss benefits will compliment, rather than duplicate each other. It must be kept in mind that the Act sets monetary limits of $15,000 for recovery of work loss benefits and $5,000 of survivor\u2019s loss benefits. If actual losses do not reach or exceed these limits, the full amounts of these basic loss benefits need not be paid. The position taken by the Superior Court in Heffner is the most cogent approach to the No-Fault Act. The recovery of work loss benefits by survivors of deceased victims best fulfills the legislature\u2019s express intention to provide \u201ccompensation of the economic losses of the survivors of all individuals killed in motor vehicle accidents\u201d by providing \u201cadequate basic loss benefits [to] . .. the survivors of deceased victims.\u201d\nThe orders of the Superior Court are affirmed.\nKAUFFMAN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nLARSEN, J., concurred in the result.\n. Act of July 19, 1974, P.L. 489, No. 176, 40 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1009.101 et seq. (Supp. 1980-81) hereinafter the Act of the No-Fault Act.\n. President Judge Cercone wrote the majority opinion, joined by Judge Hester. Judges Van der Voort and Spaeth joined the majority opinion with the understanding that it did not authorize double recovery. Judge Price noted his dissent. Former President Judge Jacobs and Judge Hoffman did not participate in the consideration or decision of the case.\n. In addition to the briefs submitted by both sets of appellants and appellees in these cases, we have had the benefit of amicus curiae briefs submitted by the Pennsylvania Trial Lawyers Association on behalf of appellee Heffner, and by the Insurance Federation of Pennsylvania, the National Association of Independent Insurers, and the American Insurance Association on behalf of appellants, Allstate and USF&G.\n. The definitions given by the legislature to the terms of a statute are controlling. As we stated in Hughes v. Pittsburgh, 379 Pa. 145, 148, 108 A.2d 698, 699 (1954):\nWhere, however, the statute or ordinance defines a word or phrase therein the court is bound thereby. In Sterling v.
