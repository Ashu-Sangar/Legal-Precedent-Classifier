{"id": "1250868", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Bell,\nPlaton P'eters, an individual trading under the fictitious name of \u201cMajestic Restaurant\u201d which is located at 2442 Kensington Avenue, Philadelphia, filed a complaint in equity to restrain defendants, who are also engaged in the restaurant business at 3171 Kensington Avenue, Philadelphia, from using the trade name of \u201cMajestic Grille\u201d. Defendants\u2019 restaurant is on the same street as plaintiff\u2019s, approximately 7 blocks away.\nWe summarize the Chancellor\u2019s findings:\nIn 1924 plaintiff, defendant Machikas, and George Anagnastou formed a partnership to operate a restaurant under the name of \u201cMajestic Restaurant\u201d at 2442 Kensington Avenue, Philadelphia. In 1932 that partnership established another restaur\u00e1nt under the name of \u201cMajestic Restaurant\u201d at 13th and Arch Streets. In 1936 that partnership established another restaurant under the name of \u201cMajestic Restaurant\u201d at 3171 Kensington Avenue, where defendants at the present time conduct their restaurant.\nIn 1949 the partnership sold a one-half interest in the restaurant at 3171 Kensington Avenue to James Krassas and the name of the restaurant was changed to \u201cBetsy Ross Restaurant\u201d:\nOn February 9, 1950 the\" partnership was dissolved and the assets distributed as .follows: Plaintiff was given. the restaurant located, at Kensington Avenue, known, as the \u201cMajestic. Restaurant\u201d; defendant Machikas was given the restaurant at.Sill Kensington Avenue known as the \u201cBetsy Ross Restaurant\u201d and other assets not here relevant; One paragraph of the agreement of dissolution provided that \u201cPeters [plaintiff] shall have the full right to the name of Majestic Restaurant at 2442 Kensington Avenue and elsewhere.\u201d\nIn August, 1952 defendants (Machikas and his partner Kellos) commenced using the name \u201cMajestic Grille\u201d for their restaurant at 3171 Kensington Avenue. We note that defendants could not use, under Machikas\u2019 agreement with Peters, the name \u201cMajestic Restaurant\u201d; and the question arises whether \u201cMajestic Grille\u201d is, under the facts in this case, so similar as reasonably likely to confuse or deceive prospective customers or otherwise harm the plaintiff.\nThe Chancellor further found that the plaintiff has spent approximately $20,000. in improving his restaurant and in purchasing new equipment; and that he has also expended unknown sums of money for advertising his restaurant by the distribution of handbills and certain novelties in northeast Philadelphia. Defendants took into their employ certain employees formerly employed by plaintiff in his restaurant at 2442 Kensington Avenue, although the Chancellor did not pass upon plaintiff\u2019s allegation that these employees were \u201cpirated\u201d by defendants.\nOne of the Chancellor\u2019s most important findings of fact (which is unchallenged) was that defendants\u2019 restaurant has a large neon sign in the window bearing the word \u201cMajestic\u201d in letters 10 to 12 inches in height, and the word \u201cGrille\u201d in letters 3 or 4 inches in height; and that defendants also have a sign in their window reading \u201cMajestic Restaurant\u201d. This is certainly very improper, very misleading and deceiving, and undoubtedly very detrimental to the interests of the plaintiff, as well as a violation of the Fictitious Names Act under which defendants (and plaintiff) were registered.\nThe Chancellor further found that there was no satisfactory evidence that the defendants\u2019 use of the name \u201cMajestic Grille\u201d has caused any confusion among customers, tradespeople and other persons dealing with plaintiff, or that defendants\u2019 business is in competition with plaintiff\u2019s business, or that defendants\u2019 use of the name \u201cMajestic Grille\u201d was used with intent to injure or defraud plaintiff.\nFindings of fact made by a Chancellor who saw and heard the witnesses, when confirmed by the Court en banc, will not be reversed on appeal if they are supported by adequate evidence: Pregrad v. Pregrad, 367 Pa. 177, 80 A. 2d 58; Barrett v. Heiner, 367 Pa. 510, 80 A. 2d 729. However, that well-settled principle is confined to findings which are true and genuine findings of fact. \u201cWith respect to [a] inferences and deductions from facts and [b] conclusions of law, both the Court en banc and the appellate Courts have the power to draw their own inferences and make their own deductions and conclusions: Barrett v. Heiner, 367 Pa. 510, 80 A. 2d 729; Noonan Estate, 361 Pa. 26, 63 A. 2d 80; Payne v. Winters, 366 Pa. 299, 77 A. 2d 407; Smith v. Smith, 364 Pa. 1, 70 A. 2d 630.\u201d: Kalyvas v. Kalyvas, 371 Pa. 371, 375-376, 89 A. 2d 819.\nWe cannot agree with several of the Chancellor\u2019s conclusions. Defendant, Machikas, was asked the following questions: \u201cQ. Why did you change the name from Betsy Ross to Majestic Grille? A. Well, the reason why, because that fellow, you know, he make the place a wreck out of it and I put my name on it, Majestic, because people know me over there for thirty years. That is why. . . . Q. Why didn\u2019t you call it the Majestic Restaurant instead of the Majestic Grille? A. Well, I talked with my partner and we say we put Majestic Grille. Q. Why did you say Grille? You always used the word restaurant. . . . Q. Didn\u2019t you use Majestic Restaurant all the time since you were in business? Isn\u2019t that what you said? A. I was interested with Majestic because every place I was I call it Majestic. Q. But you called it Majestic Restaurant, didn\u2019t you, all the time? A. That\u2019s right. Q. Why did you change it suddenly to Majestic Grille in August or September of 1952? A. Also I got the sign up there. I put restaurant, too. Q. All right. Why did you register as Majestic Grille instead of Majestic Restaurant? BY THE COURT: Q. Can you tell us why you preferred to use the name grille instead of restaurant? A. As long as I put the Majestic\u2014 Q. What? A. I don\u2019t think it was different. . . . Q. But why didn\u2019t you use restaurant? You have got a restaurant there; isn\u2019t that so? Why didn\u2019t you use Majestic Restaurant? A. Well, on the sign up there it says restaurant, and then the window it says Majestic Grille. Q. You got a big neon sign in the window saying Majestic Grille? A. That\u2019s right. BY THE COURT: Q. But you have another sign on the premises which says Majestic Restaurant? A. That\u2019s right. . . .\u201d\nIt is clear from defendant\u2019s own testimony that the 12 inch-high word \u201cMajestic\u201d is the key word he was interested in and wanted; and that he didn\u2019t think the word \u201cGrille\u201d was different from \u201cRestaurant\u201d; and that he used the sign \u201cMajestic Restaurant\u201d in his window. How, in view of that testimony, is it possible to defend defendants\u2019 change of name from \u201cBetsy Ross\u201d to \u201cMajestic Grille\u201d or \u201cMajestic Restaurant\u201d, or to find that Machikas did not intend to break his agreement Avith plaintiff, or did not intend to injure plaintiff, or to divert plaintiff\u2019s business to the defendants.\nWhile the Chancellor did not consider the evidence was sufficient to establish confusion among customers and tradespeople between plaintiff\u2019s restaurant and defendants\u2019 restaurant, credible witnesses did testify that bills for food delivered to defendants were erroneously sent to plaintiff; that people telephoned plaintiff asking whether this was defendants\u2019 \u201cMajestic Restaurant\u201d; that food was delivered to plaintiff that was intended to be delivered to defendants; and that the Bureau of Assistance called several times to check on employment involving persons employed or seeking employment at defendants\u2019 \u201cMajestic Restaurant\u201d. All of this occurred within the period of two months prior to this suit. Considering the difficulty of proving confusion (and loss of trade, as to which there was inadequate evidence) we consider this testimony was both important and adequate.\nIn KoolVent Metal Awning Corp. v. Price, 368 Pa. 528, 84 A. 2d 296, this Court held that the trade mark \u201cKool-Vent\u201d was not infringed by the use of the name \u201cCool-Ray\u201d, and said (pp. 532, 533, 534) : \u201cThe law in this class of cases is well established; its application to different facts and circumstances is sometimes difficult. Descriptive, geographical and generic words, as well as words of common or general usage belong to the public and are not capable of exclusive appropriation by anyone. This general principle is subject to the limitation or exception that if a trade name or trade-mark or other word or words have acquired, in the trade and in the minds of the purchasing public, a special so-called secondary meaning, i.e., have come to mean that the article is the product of a certain manufacturer or of a particular individual or corporation, such trade name or trade-mark or word or words will be protected against infringement: Quaker State Oil v. Steinberg, 325 Pa. 273, 189 A. 473; Kellogg Co. v. National Biscuit Co., 305 U. S. 111; Thomson-Porcelite Co. v. Harad, 356 Pa. 121, 51 A. 2d 605; Stroehmann Brothers Co. v. Manbeck Baking Co., 331 Pa. 96, 200 A. 97. Even though a word or phrase or mark has acquired a special or secondary meaning, the right of protection does not extend a monopoly to every word in the name, but the protection will be afforded only against names or marks which are deceptively similar thereto and consequently are likely to confuse the public: Quaker State Oil v. Steinberg, 325 Pa., supra. . . .\n\u201cWhile the chancellor found as a fact that there was no intent to deceive, an actual intent to deceive is not indispensable: American Clay Mfg. Co. v. American Clay Mfg. Co., 198 Pa. 189, 47 A. 936. All that is necessary is that the court shall find from the evidence that the name or mark or label, or the conduct and practices of the defendant actually confused and deceived or that it is reasonably likely that the average purchaser will be deceived; possibility that purchasers will be misled is not enough: Stroehmann Brothers Co. v. Manbeck Baking Co., 331 Pa. 96, 98, 200 A. 97; Thomson-Porcelite Co. v. Harad, 356 Pa. 121, 51 A. 2d 605; Quaker State Oil v. Steinberg, 325 Pa. 273, 189 A. 473.\u201d\nWe find that the use of the name \u201cMajestic Grille\u201d together with the conduct and practices of these defendants actually have or it is reasonably likely that they will confuse and deceive the average prospective customer of plaintiff\u2019s and the public generally; and that the use of the words \u201cMajestic Restaurant\u201d or \u201cMajestic Grille\u201d is unfair competition which is detrimental to plaintiff and cannot be tolerated.\nFor these reasons the decree of the Court below is reversed, with directions to enter a decree consistent with this Opinion; costs to be paid by defendants.\nItalics throughout, ours."}
