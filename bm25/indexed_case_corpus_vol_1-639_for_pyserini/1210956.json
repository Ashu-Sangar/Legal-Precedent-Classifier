{"id": "1210956", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Schaffer,\nThe wife plaintiff, carrying her seven months\u2019 old baby in her arms, walking on the sidewalk of a street in defendant borough, stepped into a depression or hole in the pavement, fell and was injured. She and her husband brought action against the borough to recover damages for her injuries. The jury which heard the case disagreed. The court entered judgment for defendants (an additional defendant having been brought in) on the ground of contributory negligence, and from this ruling plaintiffs appeal.\nRecounting the incidents connected with her fall, plaintiff said that, as she was walking along the street, in the afternoon of a clear day, carrying the baby on her left arm, protecting its back with her right, \u201cI tripped on the curb and I fell.\u201d She ascribed the fall to \u201cthe sunken hole right next to the curb.\u201d She described the hole, from observation after she arose, as being two inches from the curb and being about three feet long. She said she noticed \u201cpart of the broken sidewalk\u201d as she approached, but \u201cdidn\u2019t see the hole.\u201d She gave, as the excuse for not seeing it, that \u201cthe baby was obstructing my Anew.\u201d She admitted that she \u201ccould move her and look down\u201d, that if she had not had the baby in her arms she would \u201chave been able to see it [the hole] clearly\u201d, and further, that there was room on the sidewalk for her to have proceeded without stepping in the hole.\nUnder the facts as plaintiff depicted them, the court properly determined she was guilty of contributory negligence as a matter of law: Allshouse v. Wilkinsburg Borough, 343 Pa. 323, 22 A. 2d 756; White v. Harrisburg, 342 Pa. 556, 20 A. 2d 751; Lautenbacher v. Philadelphia, 217 Pa. 318, 66 A. 549. In the latter case, the injured person was carrying a lounge and stepped into a hole in the sidewalk. We said (p. 319) : \u201cBy carrying the couch in the Avay she did, the appellant voluntarily impeded her view and disabled herself from the proper performance of her duty to look where she was going.\u201d Here, by carrying the child in the way she did, plaintiff likewise impeded her view and disabled herself from seeing where she was stepping.\nJudgment affirmed."}
