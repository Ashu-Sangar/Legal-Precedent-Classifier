Showell, Fryer & Co., 276 Pa. 587, we held that the issues involved were for the jury.\nA reading of the records shows the evidence at the last trial to be at least equally as strong for plaintiff as that at the former trial; which is all that need be said in disposing of the present appeal.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
