{"id": "1751217", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant Rickie Yocham appeals from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Somerset County denying post-conviction relief. The court rejected appellant\u2019s claim that appellate counsel provided constitutionally ineffective representation by abandoning a challenge to the admissibility of an inculpatory statement made to Pennsylvania State Police. We agree with appellant that the court erroneously rejected his claim and reverse.\nPennsylvania State Police suspected appellant\u2019s involvement in a Somerset County homicide and robbery. Four months after the Somerset County crimes, Pittsburgh police took appellant into custody in connection with an Allegheny County rape. State police learned that appellant was in the custody of Pittsburgh police and went to the Pittsburgh Public Safety Building to question him. Appellant admitted his involvement in the Somerset County crimes. Appellant was then charged with murder, robbery, and conspiracy.\nThe court of common pleas appointed counsel to represent appellant. In a pre-trial motion to suppress, appellant contended that the inculpatory statement was the product of an illegal arrest. The Commonwealth sought to prove both that police gave appellant Miranda warnings and that no evidence of police coercion existed. But the Commonwealth failed to demonstrate that the arrest was lawful or that the inculpatory statement was not the product of the allegedly unlawful arrest. The suppression court nonetheless denied the motion.\nA jury convicted appellant of murder of the first degree, robbery and conspiracy. In post-verdict motions, appellant renewed his challenge to the admissibility of the inculpatory statement. The court of common pleas denied the motions. Appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction and received concurrent sentences on the robbery and conspiracy convictions. On direct appeal, the same appointed counsel alleged various trial errors, but did not pursue the challenge to the inculpatory statements. This Court affirmed judgments of sentence. Commonwealth v. Yocham, 464 Pa. 223, 346 A.2d 297 (1975).\nAppellant, with the assistance of new counsel, filed a petition for post-conviction relief in which he challenged the effectiveness of appellate counsel in failing to pursue the claim that his inculpatory statement was unlawful. The PCHA court summarily dismissed the petition without a hearing. This Court reversed and remanded for a hearing on appellant\u2019s petition. Commonwealth v. Yocham, 473 Pa. 445, 375 A.2d 325 (1977).\nAt the hearing, trial counsel testified that, following the hearing on the motion to suppress, he conducted an \u201cindependent investigation\u201d into facts the Commonwealth did not introduce at the suppression hearing. Counsel stated that his investigation into facts outside the record led him to conclude that Pittsburgh police took appellant into custody on the basis of an arrest warrant. Counsel concluded that appellant\u2019s assertion \u201chad no factual basis\u201d and was improper. Counsel decided not to \u201cpress the issue further.\u201d The PCHA court again denied relief and this appeal followed.\nCounsel\u2019s conclusion that his client\u2019s suppression claim \u201chad no factual basis\u201d does not justify the abandonment of the issue on appeal where at the suppression hearing the Commonwealth fails to meet its burden of proving that the challenged evidence was legally obtained. Once appellant filed his motion to suppress the inculpatory statement, the Commonwealth was obliged to demonstrate the lawfulness of the statement by a preponderance of the evidence. See Pa.R.Crim.Proc. 323(h) (\u201c[t]he Commonwealth shall have the burden of going forward with the evidence and of establishing that the challenged evidence was not obtained in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights\u201d); Commonwealth ex rel. Butler v. Rundle, 429 Pa. 141, 239 A.2d 426 (1968) (preponderance of the evidence standard). While the Commonwealth produced evidence concerning the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s statement, it came forward with no evidence supporting the lawfulness of appellant\u2019s arrest. Nor did it meet its burden of demonstrating that appellant\u2019s inculpatory statement was not the product of the allegedly unlawful arrest. See e. g., Brown v. Illinois, 422 U.S. 590, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975) (state has burden of demonstrating dissipation of primary illegality).\nDespite the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to meet its burden, and despite appellant\u2019s insistence that the challenge to the admissibility of the statement be pursued, counsel chose to' abandon the claim. The decision to abandon the motion was based upon an inquiry into what evidence the Commonwealth could, but did not, present at the suppression hearing. On the basis of these facts outside the record, counsel interposed a personal judgment concerning the propriety and validity of appellant\u2019s motion and did not pursue a meritorious claim.\nIn Commonwealth v. Yocham, 473 Pa. at 451, 375 A.2d at 328, this Court stated: \u201c[Wjhen a contention which is not patently frivolous is abandoned, the decision to do so must be justified by some reasonable basis intended to inure to the client\u2019s benefit.\u201d Commonwealth v. Townsell, 474 Pa. 563, 569, 379 A.2d 98, 101 (1977), further stated: \u201cStrategy of defense counsel may warrant deliberate choice as to the manner, emphasis, and length of [oral] argument but complete disregard of an important issue cannot be ignored.\u201d Appellant\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden at the suppression hearing was not patently frivolous. Indeed, the claim was an important and meritorious issue which counsel should not have disregarded. That appellate counsel, because of a personal view of facts outside the record, considered pursuit of the claim improper, does not justify a contrary conclusion. \u201cThe constitutional requirement of substantial equality and fair process can only be attained where counsel acts in the role of an active advocate in behalf of his client, as opposed to that of amicus curiae.\u201d Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 1400, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). See American Bar Association Standards Relating to the Administration of Criminal Justice, Criminal Appeals, Standard 21-3.2 (2d ed. Tent. Draft 1978); High v. Rhay, 519 F.2d 109 (9th Cir. 1975) (Lumbard, J., sitting by designation). An \u201cactive advocate\u201d would violate no professional obligation by arguing that the record of the suppression hearing fails to demonstrate the admissibility of the challenged evidence.\nOn this record, appellant\u2019s inculpatory statement was inadmissible. By failing to raise this inadmissibility on appeal, counsel deprived appellant the effective representation to which he is constitutionally entitled. Appellant must therefore be awarded a new trial. Cf. Commonwealth v. Townsell, supra (new trial granted where appellate counsel failed to pursue meritorious objection to prosecuting attorney\u2019s closing argument).\nOrder reversed, judgments of sentence vacated, and new trial granted.\nNIX and LARSEN, JJ., filed dissenting opinions.\nPOMEROY, former J., and O\u2019BRIEN, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nWe hear these appeals pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 202(1) & 503(c), 17 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 211.202(1) & 211.503(c) (Supp.1978), and the Post Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P.L.
