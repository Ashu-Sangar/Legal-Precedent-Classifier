{"id": "487538", "contents": "The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered\nPer Curiam.\nThis was an action by a parent to recover damages for the death of her son on account of the alleged negligence of the defendants. It is clear, from the evidence, that the boy was on the train from day to day, not as a passenger or employee of the company, but by the connivance of the conductor, in order to sell newspapers. It is not like a person allowed by the conductor to ride in a car as a passenger without paying fare. In that case there is a legal liability to the company for the fare. This is the case of a mere trespasser, and the company owed him no duty. We are of opinion that the rulings of the learned judge below were right.\nJudgment affirmed."}
