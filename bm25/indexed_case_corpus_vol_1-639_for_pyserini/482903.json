{"id": "482903", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is a taxpayer\u2019s suit seeking to enjoin the operation of the recently enacted Nursing Home Loan Agency Law, Act of July 22, 1974, P.L.-, No. 207, Pa.Legis. Serv. 571 (1974) (to be codified as 62 P.S. \u00a7 1521.101 et seq.). Plaintiff filed his complaint in the Commonwealth Court alleging a variety of constitutional defects. Defendants petitioned this Court to assume plenary jurisdiction, which we did by per curiam order on October 25, 1974. The parties, after stipulating that no issues of fact existed to be tried, have filed motions for judgment on the pleadings. We determine that judgment should be awarded to defendants.\nThe N.H.L.A.L. stems from legislative concern with the inability of many nursing homes to provide safe and healthy accommodations for their residents. Pursuant to article VIII, section 7(a) (3) of the Constitution, P.S., the Legislature submitted to the voters the question whether they \u201cfavored the incurring of indebtedness by the Commonwealth of $100,000,000 for use as loans to repair, reconstruct and rehabilitate nursing homes in order to meet standards for health and safety ?\u201d The program was approved by referendum on May 21,1974.\nSection 201 of the Law creates the Pennsylvania Nursing Home Loan Agency composed of six ex officio members from the executive departments and three gubernatorial appointees. \u00a7 202. The agency is authorized in \u00a7 203(6) \u201cto make loans to nursing homes for repair, reconstruction and rehabilitation ... in order that such nursing homes may meet State and Federal Safety Standards . . ..\u201d Section 301 provides:\n\u201cAll nursing homes meeting applicable State and Federal regulations, with the exception of Life Safety Code, for the acceptance of Medicaid patients shall be eligible to apply for loans from the Nursing Home Loan Agency under provisions of this act.\u201d\nFunds for the loans are to be provided by a sale by competitive bidding of general obligation bonds (not exceeding $100,000,000) backed by the credit of the Commonwealth. \u00a7\u00a7 401, 402(c). The Law creates a sinking fund for payment of interest and principal. \u00a7 408(a). The sources of the sinking fund are funds received in repayment of loans to nursing homes and appropriations by the Legislature. \u00a7\u00a7 205, 411.\nPlaintiff\u2019s first attack on the N.H.L.A.L. is cast in terms of the absence of a public purpose. He invokes the principle, well-settled for over a century, that \u201cthe legislature [does not have] any constitutional right to create a public debt, or to lay a tax, ... in order to raise funds for a mere private purpose.\u201d Sharpless v. Mayor of Philadelphia, 21 Pa. 147, 168 (1853) (opinion of Black, C. J.); see Citizens\u2019 Savings & Loan Association v. Topeka, 87 U.S. (20 Wall.) 655, 22 L.Ed. 455 (1874). He does not contend that the safety of residents of nursing homes is not a proper subject of legislative concern. Rather, he argues that (1) the means chosen by the Legislature are not \u201creasonably designed to achieve its stated public purpose\u201d; and (2) \u201cthe obvious private gain to proprietors of nursing homes\u201d undermines and dissipates the Law\u2019s public purpose. Both arguments are without merit.\nPlaintiff correctly asserts that the means chosen by the Legislature must be \u201creasonably designed\u201d to achieve permissible ends. Basehore v. Hampden Industrial Development Authority, 433 Pa. 40, 50, 248 A.2d 212, 217 (1968); see id. at 65, 248 A.2d at 224 (concurring opinion of this writer). However, the role of the judiciary in scrutinizing the particular approach selected by the Legislature is a limited one. We do not, at the invitation of a disgruntled taxpayer, re-assess the wisdom and expediency of alternative methods of solving public problems. \u201cIt is the province of the legislature, not the judiciary, ... to determine the means necessary to combat\u201d public problems, for with means as with ends, \u201cthe legislature, which is more responsive to the people and has more adequate facilities for gathering and assembling the requisite data, is in a better position to evaluate and determine\u201d alternative approaches. Basehore, supra, at 49, 248 A.2d at 217; see also Johnson v. Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency, 453 Pa. 329, 337-338, 309 A.2d 528, 533 (1973). Our inquiry is limited to a determination of whether the means selected are so \u201cdemonstrably irrelevant to the policy the Legislature is free to adopt\u201d as to be arbitrary and irrational.\nIn this case, plaintiff has failed to demonstrate that a program of making \u201cloans to nursing homes for repair, reconstruction and rehabilitation\u201d is not a rational approach to assisting nursing homes to comply with State and Federal safety standards and thus enhancing the safety of their residents. We conclude that the legislative program is reasonably designed to effectuate the Law\u2019s public purpose. See Basehore, supra, 433 Pa. at 49-50, 248 A.2d at 217.\nPlaintiff\u2019s argument that private gain to nursing homes somehow outweighs the public purpose of the Law is equally meritless. We rejected this theory in Basehore, where we sustained the constitutionality of the Industrial Development Authority Law. Speaking through Mr. Justice (now Chief Justice) Jones, we stated:\n\u201cThe taxpayers\u2019 main concern is that the party who is really benefiting from this program is the private manufacturer who acquires an industrial plant at a much lower cost than he would have incurred had he built it himself. It is beyond question that private manufacturers receive a very large benefit from this program; however, this fact alone should not invalidate the program. If the legislative program is reasonably designed to combat a problem within the competence of the legislature and if the public will benefit from the project, then the project is sufficiently public in nature to withstand constitutional challenge.\u201d\n433 Pa. at 50, 248 A.2d at 217; see also Sharpless, supra, 21 Pa. at 169; cf. Washington Park, Inc. Appeal, 425 Pa. 349, 353, 229 A.2d 1, 3 (1967); Belovsky v. Redevelopment Authority of Philadelphia, 357 Pa. 329, 341, 54 A. 2d 277, 283 (1947). Because the N.H.L.A.L. is reasonably designed to yield benefits to the public, it withstands this constitutional challenge.\nPlaintiff next contends that the N.H.L.A.L. involves an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power in violation of article II, section 1 of the Constitution. He invokes the so-called nondelegation rule which, as a \u201cnatural corollary\u201d of article II, section 1, \u201crequires that the basic policy choices involved in \u2018legislative power\u2019 actually be made by the Legislature as constitutionally mandated.\u201d Chartiers Valley Joint Schools v. Allegheny County Board of School Directors, 418 Pa. 520, 529, 211 A.2d 487, 492 (1965). More specifically, the rule demands that, when the Legislature delegates policymaking discretion to administrative agencies, it must make the \u201cbasic policy choices\u201d which will serve as standards to guide and restrain the exercise of discretion. See Commonwealth v. Cherney, 454 Pa. 285, 289-290, 312 A.2d 38, 41 (1973); DePaul v. Kauffman, 441 Pa. 386, 391-392, 272 A.2d 500, 503 (1971); Chartiers Valley Joint Schools, supra; Commonwealth Water & Power Resources Board v. Green Spring Co., 394 Pa. 1, 5, 145 A.2d 178, 183 (1958); O\u2019Hara\u2019s Appeal, 389 Pa. 35, 47-48, 131 A.2d 587, 593 (1957).\nPlaintiff argues that the Legislature did not provide standards in the N.H.L.A.L. He points to various sections of the Law which grant the agency policy making discretion without, he contends, adequate standards. In this he is mistaken. The entire Law reveals that the agency\u2019s policy decisions must be directed to the effectuation of the Legislature\u2019s basic policy of assisting nursing homes that do not comply with the Life Safety Code and are unable to achieve compliance through private sources of financing, which assistance is to be given with prudence for protection of the loan fund. This pervasive general policy is clearly sufficient to satisfy the constitutional requirement that \u201cbasic policy choices\u201d be made by the Legislature. But the Law goes even further. It provides very specific definitions of pivotal statutory terms and detailed guidelines for certain important agency decisions. We have no doubt that the standards requirement has been satisfied.\nMore importantly, the N.H.L.A.L. provides numerous procedural guidelines for protection against administrative arbitrariness and caprice. For example, the agency is required to establish criteria for use in determination of priority among applicants and eligibility for loan refinancing and to develop a standard form for loan applications. The use of neutral, generally applicable criteria and forms is an important safeguard against the arbitrariness of ad hoc decision making. In addition, section 203(2) of the Law provides that the promulgation of rules and regulations by the agency must be in accordance with the Commonwealth Documents Laws assuring regularity and due notice in administrative policymaking.\nThe Legislature has provided adequate standards and guidelines for the guidance and restraint of administrative discretion. We reject plaintiff\u2019s contention as meritless.\nPlaintiff argues that the N.H.L.A.L. creates an arbitrary classification and thus is a \u201cspecial law\u201d violating article III, section 32 of the Constitution. Pointing to section 301 of the Law, he argues that it arbitrarily singles out the benefited class of nursing homes \u201cfrom all the other nursing homes that may not meet one or the other of State or Federal regulations for acceptance of Medicaid patients. Yet, these other facilities are caring for old and disabled citizens of Pennsylvania and urgently require this type of loan.\u201d We are not persuaded.\nIt is well settled that the prohibition of special laws does not forbid the Legislature from creating statutory classifications. Rather it requires only that a classification must have some rational relationship to a proper state purpose. See Johnson v. Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency, 453 Pa. 329, 347, 309 A.2d 528, 538 (1973); Milk Control Commission v. Battista, 413 Pa. 652, 198 A.2d 840, appeal dismissed, 379 U.S. 3, 85 S.Ct. 75, 13 L.Ed.2d 22 (1964); Philadelphia v. Smith, 412 Pa. 262, 268-269, 194 A.2d 177, 180 (1963); Bargain City U. S. A. v. Dilworth, 407 Pa. 129, 133, 179 A.2d 439, 442 (1962). Confining loans to nursing homes which comply with all \u201capplicable State and Federal regulations, with the exception of [the] Life Safety Code, for the acceptance of Medicaid patients\u201d is rationally related to a purpose of assuring that loan recipients are in all respects (except for compliance with the Life Safety Code) fit institutions for the care of their patients. We have no doubt that this purpose is a proper one, for it \u201cworks . to promote the general welfare . . . .\u201d Note, Developments in the law \u2014 Equal Protection, 82 Harv.L.Rev. 1065, 1081 (1969). Accordingly, the N.H. L.A.L. is not a \u201cspecial law.\u201d\nPlaintiff\u2019s final contention is that the N.H. L.A.L. violates article VIII, section 8 of the Constitution, which provides:\n\u201cThe credit of the Commonwealth shall not be pledged or loaned to any individual, company, corporation or association nor shall the Commonwealth become a joint owner or stockholder in any company, corporation or association.\u201d\nHe argues that the lending to nursing home proprietors of funds raised by an issue of general obligation Commonwealth bonds constitutes a pledge or loan of Commonwealth credit to the nursing homes. He correctly points out that in our two prior cases dealing with section 8, Johnson v. Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency, 453 Pa. 329, 309 A.2d 528 (1973); Basehore v. Hampden Industrial Development Authority, 433 Pa. 40, 248 A.2d 212 (1968), the obligations involved were revenue bonds not backed by the credit of the Commonwealth. We are thus presented for the first time with the question of the application of article VIII, section 8 to general obligation bonds.\nIn determining the meaning of section 8, we look to the evil to which it is addressed. See Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(3) (Special Pamphlet, 1973). In the mid-nineteenth century, industrial expansion, particularly the growth of the railroads, created great demands for investment capital. When the private sector was unable to satisfy the demand, state and local governments stepped in to fill the need. One common method of assisting the railroads to raise capital was public guaranty of railroad obligations, frequently taking the form of an exchange of railroad bonds for state bonds, which the railroad then sold on the open market. In this way, railroads were able to attract investors who, without the credit of the state on which to rely, would not have invested. Article VIII, section 8 was adopted in 1857 in reaction to and with the specific purpose of eliminating these speculative forms of financing. The phrase \u201cpledge or loan of credit\u201d is a term of art referring to these financing devices and was clearly not intended to prohibit other sorts of financial transactions between the Commonwealth and private citizens or corporations that serve a public purpose and are otherwise lawful.\nCourts may not declare a statute unconstitutional \u201cunless it clearly, palpably, and plainly violates the Constitution.\u201d Daly v. Hemphill, 411 Pa. 263, 271, 191 A.2d 835, 840 (1963). This presumption in favor of the constitutionality of a statute is strengthened where, as here, the program has been submitted to the voters and has received their approval. We would be overstepping our constitutional bounds were we to strike down an act bolstered by such a strong presumption of constitutionality on the basis of a constitutional provision designed to eliminate an evil far removed from the public goals of this enlightened legislation. Plaintiff has failed to persuade us that the N.H.L.A.L. is prohibited by article VIII, section 8.\nWe have examined the N.H.L.A.L. and the constitutional defects which plaintiff perceives. We conclude that they are meritless. Judgment on the pleadings is therefore entered for defendants. Each party to pay own costs.\nEAGEN and NIX, JJ., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 205,17 P.S. \u00a7 211.205 (Supp.1974).\n. The Legislature \u201cdetermined and declared as a matter of legislative finding\u201d that \u201cmost nursing homes in the Commonwealth do not presently comply with State and Federal Safety Standards including the Life Safety Code\u201d and that \u201cfinancing of these safety improvements is apparently not presently available through private financing under terms and conditions which would enable the improvements to be made . . ..\u201d N.H.L.A.L. \u00a7 102.\nThe Life Safety Code, a publication of the National Fire Protection Association,\n\u201cdeals with life safety from fire and like emergencies. It covers construction, protection, and occupancy features to minimize danger to life from fire, smoke, fumes, or panic before buildings are vacated. It specifies the number, size, and arrangement of exit facilities sufficient to permit prompt escape of occupants from buildings or structures in case of fire or other condition dangerous to life.\u201d\nLife Safety Code 101-1 (21st ed. 1967).\nCompliance with the Code is a prerequisite for reimbursement under the federal Medicare program (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1395x(j)(13) (1974)) and for receipt of payments under the federal Medicaid program (42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(a)(28)(F)(i) (1974)).\nMoreover, all nursing homes in the Commonwealth must be licensed by the Department of Public Welfare. Public Welfare Code, Act of June 13, 1967, PX. 31, art. 10, \u00a7 1002, 62 P.S. \u00a7 1002 (1968). A criterion for issuance of a license is that \u201cthe place to be used as a facility meet[s] all the requirements ... of the applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations . . . .\u201d Id. i 1007. One such applicable statute is the Act of April 27, 1927, P.L. 465, \u00a7 1 et seq., as amended, 35 P.S. \u00a7 1221 et seq. (1964). Section 1222 provides that one class of the \u201cbuildings and structures which it is intended that this act shall cover\u201d are \u201cconvalescent and nursing homes.\u201d Section 1221 grants authority to the Department of Labor and Industry to promulgate rules and regulations prescribing standards and requirements relating to \u201cfire and panic protection [so] as to provide for the safety and health of all persons employed, accommodated, housed, or assembled therein.\u201d The Department has adopted regulations, 34 Pa. Code \u00a7\u00a7 37.641-.647, which require buildings classified as \u201cinstitutional occupancies,\u201d which include nursing homes, to comply with the Life Safety Code. See Life Safety Code, ch. 10 (21st ed. 1967). In short, a prerequisite to licensure to operate a nursing home is compliance with the Life Safety Code.\nThis chain of interlocking statutes and regulations uncovers an anomaly in the language of the N.H.L.A.L. Section 103 of the Law defines \u201cnursing home\u201d as \u201cany facility licensed or approved as a nursing home by the Department of Public Welfare under\u201d the Public Welfare Code. As demonstrated above, the Department may not license a nursing home which does not satisfy the Life Safety Code. It would seem that nursing homes failing to comply with the Life Safety Code are not \u201cnursing homes\u201d within the meaning of the Law. This anomaly is probably the result of less than perfect drafting rather than considered legislative policy. We assume for purposes of deciding this case that the term \u201cnursing home\u201d in the N.H.L.A.L. includes: (1) nursing homes that did comply with all applicable standards when initially licensed by the Department but no longer satisfy the Life Safety Code; and (2) nursing homes that would be eligible for licensure by the Department but for noncompliance with the Life Safety Code, cf. N.H.L.A.L. \u00a7 301.\n. \u201cDebt may be incurred without limit for purposes specifically itemized in the law authorizing such debt, if the question whether the debt shall be incurred has been submitted to the electors and approved by a majority of those voting on the question.\u201d\n.

Applicable Federal standards for the acceptance of Medicaid patients are found in 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1396a(a)(28) (1974). State standards are established by the Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 904, \u00a7 5, amending the Public Welfare Code, Act of June 13, 1967, P.L. 31, art. 4, as amended, 62 P.S. \u00a7 443.1(3) (Supp.1974).\n.
