L. 736, is as follows: \u201cA referee\u2019s findings of fact shall be final, unless the board shall allow an appeal therefrom as hereinafter provided. The board\u2019s findings of fact shall in all cases be final. From the referee\u2019s decision on any question of law an appeal may be taken to the board, and from any decision of the board on a question of law an appeal may be-taken to the courts, as hereinafter provided.\u201d Referees and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board must realize the great responsibility imposed upon -them by the provision that their findings of fact are final. If they err in this respect, courts can grant no relief to p.arties who may be wronged-. In the light of the plain words of the statute, the learned court below was of the correct opinion that it could not disturb the facts found by the compensation board.\nAppeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
