{"id": "474231", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPAPADAKOS, Justice.\nOn June 2, 1989, Thomas R. Martin, Appellant, injured his lower back during the course of his employment with Emmaus Bakery, Appellee. Appellant was totally disabled due to the injury which was diagnosed as a possible disc herniation, the type of injury which is routinely treated by chiropractic manipulation and physiotherapy. Appellant immediately began chiropractic treatment with Dr. Gary Tarola, a Board certified specialist in chiropractic orthopedics. As a result of the chiropractic treatment and physiotherapy, Appellant was able to return to work on June 9, 1989, seven days after his work-related injury.\nAppellee denied payment for the first two weeks of chiropractic care provided by Dr. Tarola to Appellant. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation referee found as fact that the treatment rendered to Appellant during the first fourteen days after his work-related injury was both \u201creasonable and necessary.\u201d (Referee\u2019s Finding of Fact number 7). However, the referee denied Appellant\u2019s claim petition seeking reimbursement. In rendering his decision, the referee concluded that despite Appellee\u2019s posting of a panel of physicians in accordance with Section 306(f)(1) of the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (the Act) of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7 531(1), Appellant, instead, elected to seek treatment from a chiropractor, which precluded him from remuneration.\nAppellant appealed the referee\u2019s decision to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Board) which affirmed, finding that Appellant\u2019s failure to seek treatment from a physician named on Appellee\u2019s designated list removes Appellee\u2019s obligation to pay for treatment within the first fourteen days following the injury.\nOn appeal, the Commonwealth Court, in affirming the Board\u2019s decision, determined that under the 1978 amendment to Section 306(f)(1) of the Act an employer is required to reimburse only for treatment rendered by practitioners on the designated list. Martin v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Emmaus Bakery), 161 Pa.Cmwlth.Ct. 637, 638 A.2d 294 (1994).\nAppellant now comes before us in an effort to clarify what appears to be an absurd application of the Act which would limit injured employees from obtaining appropriate care simply because their employer failed to include a suitable practitioner on the designated list. Appellant argues that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s analysis relies heavily on its misinterpretation of our holding in Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Collier) v. Overmyer, 473 Pa. 369, 374 A.2d 689 (1977), wherein we reversed the Commonwealth Court which, in turn, had reversed the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board\u2019s ruling that chiropractor charges were payable under Section 306(f).\nThe issue presented in Overmyer was whether, under the pre-1978 version of Section 306(f) of the Act, an employer who had designated a list of five physicians, was responsible for treatment rendered by a licensed practitioner of the healing arts.\nIn concluding that the chiropractic services were reimbursable, we noted:\nIf the legislature had intended to restrict the employee\u2019s rights to choose \u201cany practitioner of the healing art,\u201d it could have limited that choice by allowing the employer to designate certain \u201cpractitioners of the healing arts\u201d from which the employee was to choose ... we believe the legislature intended only to limit the employe\u2019s choice as to \u201cphysicians,\u201d if the employe desired to be treated by a \u201cphysician,\u201d and if the employer had designated five \u201cphysicians\u201d in accord with the statute.\nOvermyer, 473 Pa. at 375, 374 A.2d at 691-92.\nFollowing our decision in Overmyer, the legislature amended Section 306(f) by repealing certain language and enacting new Section 306(f)(1) which permits employers to include both physicians and other practitioners on their designated lists.\nThe 1978 version of Section 306(f)(1) is at issue here: The employer shall provide payment for reasonable surgical and medical services, services rendered by duly licensed practitioners of the healing arts, medicines, and supplies, as and when needed: Provided, That [the employe may select a duly licensed practitioner of the healing arts of his own choice, unless at least five physicians shall have been designated by the employer or the employer and the employer\u2019s representative by agreement, in which instance the employe shall select a physician from among those designated] if a list of at least five designated physicians or other duly licensed practitioners of the healing arts or a combination thereof is provided by the employer, the employe shall be required to visit one of the physicians or other practitioners so designated and shall continue to visit the same or another physician or practitioner for a period of fourteen days from the date of the first visit. Subsequent treatment may be provided by any physician or any other duly licensed practitioner of the healing arts or a combination thereof, of the employe[\u2019Js own choice, and such treatment shall be paid for by the employer.\n77 P.S. \u00a7 531(1) (Emphasis added).\nAppellee argues that under amended Section 306(f)(1) an employer should not be responsible to pay medical benefits to a particular type of provider not included on the employer\u2019s designated list for treatment sought within the first fourteen days following a work-related injury because this would place an unreasonable burden upon employers in terms of both time and money and would require employers \u201cto locate and evaluate the qualifications of innumerable duly licensed practitioners of the healing arts.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s brief, p. 15).\nThe Commonwealth Court was apparently persuaded with this reasoning and concluded that in Section 306(f)(1), the General Assembly decided to require employers to reimburse claimants only for treatments rendered by practitioners contained on the list during the statutory fourteen day period \u25a0without regard to whether those physicians or practitioners would be of any help to an injured employee.\nBecause we agree with Appellant that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s interpretation of Section 306(f)(1) is overly narrow, we now reverse.\nWe begin by noting that our scope of review in workmen\u2019s compensation matters is limited to determining whether there has been a constitutional violation, an error of law, or a violation of Appeal Board procedure, and whether necessary findings of facts are supported by substantial evidence. St. Joe Container Company v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Staroschuck), 534 Pa. 347, 633 A.2d 128 (1993).\nOur basic premise in workmen\u2019s compensation matters is that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act is remedial in nature and is intended to benefit workers and, therefore, the act must be liberally construed in order to effectuate its humanitarian objectives. Peterson v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (PRN Nursing Agency), 528 Pa. 279, 597 A.2d 1116 (1991).\nThe language of Section 306(f)(1) before us requires an employer to provide 1) a list of five designated physicians, or 2) a list of five other duly licensed practitioners of the healing arts, or 3) a combination thereof from which an injured employee can make a choice in being treated. The latitude the employer is given in creating a list of designated physicians and practitioners of the healing arts is obviously designed to afford an employer an opportunity to direct its injured employees, in the first two weeks of an injury, to physicians and practitioners of the employer\u2019s preference. Admittedly, it is impossible to predict all the different types of job-related injuries which can befall an employee, but when an employer fails to include on the designated list those physicians or practitioners required by the injured employee for proper treatment of a particular job-related injury, we see nothing in the statute that prevents the employer from being required to pay for the employee\u2019s treatment by the physician or practitioner which the employee\u2019s injury dictates. Overmyer does not stand for a different proposition and, in fact, as in Overmyer, we see no evidence in the statute\u2019s amendment of legislative intent to take away an employee\u2019s right to use the type of practitioner of the healing arts needed when none are in the list designated by the employer.\nHere, Appellant was in need of chiropractic services. He did not need the services of a physician. The referee specifically found that the care given by the two chiropractors (which amounted to $445.00, of which the sum of $296.00 was incurred during the first 14 days following Appellant\u2019s injury) were both reasonable and necessary and that finding of fact is not challenged by Appellee. Appellee\u2019s list of designated physicians and practitioners of the healing arts did not include any chiropractors. As a result, Appellant was required to choose his own chiropractor. The Commonwealth Court\u2019s interpretation of Section 306(f)(1), as a practical matter, would force injured workers to wait fourteen days before seeking proper treatment where an employer fails to include a suitable physician or practitioner of the healing arts on its designated list. Under the Commonwealth Court\u2019s ruling, if an injured employee requires the services of a dentist, but the employer\u2019s designated list contains only names of physicians and no dentists, then the employee would either have to wait for fourteen days before seeing a dentist or pay for the first fourteen days of treatment for the work-related injury from his own pocket. We reject such a reading of the Act since it is not harmonious with the humanitarian nature of the Act.\nRather, we interpret the Act to require Appellee to reimburse Appellant for chiropractic treatment where the treatment was necessary and reasonable for the type of injury involved and where no suitable physician or practitioner (in this case a chiropractor) was included on the list of designated physicians of practitioners of the healing arts.\nThe opinion and order of the Commonwealth Court are reversed and the matter is remanded to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board to enter an order reimbursing Appellant for the chiropractic treatment provided during June 2, 1989 to June 9, 1989.\nCAPPY, J., files a Dissenting Opinion in which CASTILLE and MONTEMURO, JJ., join.\nMONTEMURO, J., is sitting by designation.\n. On July 1, 1978, by Act No. 1978-119, the General Assembly deleted the bracketed portion from the 1974 amended section and replaced it with the italicized portion immediately following the last bracket."}
