{"id": "4254629", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 16th day of June, 2014, the Order of the Commonwealth Court is VACATED, and the matter is remanded per the terms of Mr. Justice Baer\u2019s responsive opinion in Commonwealth v. TAP Pharm. Prods., Inc., J-52B-2014, 626 Pa. 1, 94 A.3d 350, 2014 WL 2723008 (2014).\nJustice STEVENS did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nJustice BAER files a concurring statement in which Justices TODD and McCAFFERY join.\n. The vacation here, as in the noted case involving a different pharmaceutical company, rests on the Commonwealth\u2019s failure, by any measure, to offer a rational accounting for the billion dollars in rebate monies which Commonwealth agencies received from drug manufacturers which it haled into court. In the present case, we recognize that the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s damages expert, Frederick R. Warren-Boulton, PhD, was more extensive than it was in the earlier case as it concerned the rebate question. Nevertheless, such testimony was based upon an \"overhead shifting\u201d theory which the economist conceded could not be proved and was only theoretical. See N.T., November 3, 2010, at 2430-31. The Commonwealth obviously could not satisfy its burden of proof via theories unsupported by evidence. Cf. Lower Makefield Twp. v. Lands of Dalgewicz, 620 Pa. 312, 67 A.3d 772, 776 n. 5 (2013) (explaining that an expert's conclusions must be grounded upon salient record-based facts). Outside the unproven \u201coverhead shifted\u201d theory, Mr. Warren-Boulton conceded as follows in an interchange with counsel:\nQ. [Wjould you agree that these rebates lower the net cost of each drug that is dispensed and reimbursed by DPW and PACE?\nA. Holding constant other payments by DPW and PACE, of course, yes....\nN.T., November 3, 2010, at 2435."}
