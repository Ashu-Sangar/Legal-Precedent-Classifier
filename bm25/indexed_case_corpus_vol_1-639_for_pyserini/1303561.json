{"id": "1303561", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nThese appeals are from a judgment of the Superior Court which reversed a Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (Commission) order entered in a rate case.\nOn April 28, 1959, Scranton Steam Heat Company (Company) filed with the Commission a supplement to its steam heat tariff, to become effective July 1,1959, which supplement provided for increases in the Company\u2019s base rates for steam heat service. .To th\u00e9se proposed rate increases the City of Scranton (Scranton) and one Harry Klein (Klein), a consumer, filed complaints. The Commission, pending disposition of these complaints, suspended the effective date of the proposed rate increases, held hearings and on April 28, 1960 the Commission sustained the complaints and directed the Company to cancel its steam heat tariff supplement. The reversal of that order by the Superior Court is challenged on these appeals.\nThe factual background is relatively simple. The plant for furnishing both electric service and steam heat service was constructed by the Scranton Electric Company (Electric) in 1894. On January 31, 1956, Pennsylvania Power & Light Company (Power & Light) acquired this plant from Electric. On September 26, 1956, the Company acquired the steam heat service facilities of the plant from Power & Light for $250,000. The property acquired consisted of (a) a production system used by Electric and Power & Light both to produce steam used in the generation of electricity and to supply steam heat; (b) a distribution system; (c) general property, (b) and (c) being employed exclusively in steam heat service. As found by the Commission upon sufficient evidence, Power and Light did not need in 1956 the production system to generate steam for electricity and it offered for sale only that portion of the production system used and useful in supplying steam heat service plus the distribution system and general property.\nIn 1953, Electric had applied for rate increases and, at that time, the Commission found that 60% of the production system was devoted to electric service and 40% devoted to steam heat service and, in fixing the electric and steam heat base, such allocation of use of the production system was employed by the Commission (Pa. P.U.C. v. Scranton Electric Company, 31 Pa. P.U.C; 650, 658, 660) and the steam distribution system and general property were included exclusively in the steam heat rate base and not in the electric rate base. It is clear beyond question that Power & Light sold and the Company purchased in 1956 only that portion of the property used and useful in the supplying of steam heat service.\nOne narrow issue is presented on this appeal: whether the Commission\u2019s order which fixed the \u201cfair value\u201d of the Company\u2019s property on the sole basis of the acquisition cost in 1956 and the allowance for annual depreciation is legally sustainable?\nThe Commission fixed the \u201cfair value\u201d of the Company\u2019s property at $900,000; In so doing, it aggregated the (1) acquisition or purchase price of the plant of $250,000; (2) organization expenses of $5,257; (3) net plant additions of $357,655 from the date of purchase to the end of the test year on February 28, 1959,\u00ae \u2014 a total of $612,913. From this total, the Commission deducted (1) depreciation on the plant accrued since the date of purchase, $73,500, said depreciation being determined by the straight-line remainder life method. To the net total of $539,413 \u2014 $612,912 less $73,500\u2014 the Commission allowed $230,000 for materials and supplies, for a total of $769,413. Giving \u201cconsideration to the decline in value of the dollar in addition to recognizing that [the Company] is a going concern\u201d, the Commission added an additional $130,587 for k total \u201cfair value\u201d of $900,000.\nThe Company offered evidence of three measures of value: (1) original cost \u2014 $2,200,000; (2) reproduction cost at spot prices \u2014 $5,772,000; (3) reproduction cost at five year average prices \u2014 $5,074,000 as evidence of \u201cfair value\u201d.\nMore than half a century ago it was held that \u201cthe basis of all calculations as to the reasonableness of rates to be charged . . . must be the fair value of the property being used by it for the convenience of the public. . . . What the company is . entitled to ask is a fair return upon the value of that which it employs for the public convenience\u201d: Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466; Pittsburgh v. Pa. P. U. C., 187 Pa. Superior Ct. 341, 144 A. 2d 648; Pittsburgh et al. v. Pa. P. U. C., 158 Pa. Superior Ct. 229, 44 A. 2d 614; Solar Electric Company v. Pa. P. U. C., 137 Pa.

Superior Ct. 341, 349, 144 A. 2d 648, the Court recognized the rule which for decades has been the law in Pennsylvania: \u201cFair value for rate-making purposes, however, is not the literal present fair value for any particular purpose, biit it is the fair value of the property as that term is understood for rate-making purposes; in this respect, fair value has a connotation peculiar to rate proceedings. There is no particular formula by which the Commission is bound in fixing the rate base; all facts which have a relevant bearing on fair value, as that term is used in rate proceedings, should be considered . . . \u2018Under the fair value rule prevailing in this state, consideration should be given to original cost and average price reproduction cost of the property;...\u2019\u201d\nOriginal cost means original cost of construction of the facilities and is a factor which must be considered by the Commission in arriving at the \u201cfair, value\u201d for rate making purposes: Harrisburg Steel Corp. v. Pa. P. U. C., 176 Pa. Superior Ct. 550, 109 A. 2d 719; Pittsburgh v. Pa. P. U. C., 171 Pa. Superior Ct. 391, 90 A. 2d 850; Scranton-Spring Brook Water Service Co. v. Pa. P. U. C., 165 Pa. Superior Ct. 286, 67 A. 2d 735; Solar Electric Company v. Pa. P. U. C., 137 Pa. Superior Ct. 325, 9 A. 2d 447.; Peoples Natural Gas Co. v. Pa. P. U. C., 153 Pa. Superior Ct. 475, 34 A. 2d 375. In addition, reproduction cost of a utility\u2019s facilities is a factor which must be considered and weighed by the Commission in arriving at \u201cfair value\u201d: Pittsburgh v. Pa. P. U. C., supra; Pittsburgh v. Pa. P. U. C., 171 Pa. Superior Ct. 187, 90 A. 2d 607; Riverton Consolidated Water Co. v. Pa. P. U. C., 186 Pa. Superior Ct. 1, 140 A. 2d 114; Solar Electric Company v. Pa. P. U. C., supra. The only reason for according little or no weight to the cost of reproduction is where the facilities have become so obsolete as to make highly improbable and unlikely the facilities\u2019 reproduction: Philadelphia v. Pa. P. U. C., 173 Pa. Superior Ct. 38, 95 A. 2d 244. The instant record reveals no reason for the application of this exception.\nIn the case at bar, the Commission acknowledged that \u201clong-accepted law and precedent\u201d required consideration of both original cost and reproduction cost, but nevertheless rejected both original cost and reproduction cost and placed its determination solely and frankly on acquisition cost alone, i.e., that which ithe Company had paid for the property in 1956. Acquisition cost is not and never has been iu Pennsylvania the criterion of \u201cfair val\u00fae\u201d or a substitute for either or both the factors of original cost of construction or reproduction cost: Harrisburg Steel Corp. v. Pa. P. U. C., 176 Pa. Superior Ct. 550, 109 A. 2d 719; Peoples Natural Gas Company v. Pa. P. U. C., 153 Pa. Superior Ct. 475, 34 A. 2d 375; Mercersburg Electric Co. v. P. S. C., 76 Pa. Superior Ct. 58. In Harrisburg, supra, p. 556, it was stated: \u201cThe amount paid by the Company in acquiring the utilities, even if it be assumed that the transactions were at arms length, cannot be adopted as original cost for rate making purposes.\u201d The Commission itself in the past has recognized this principle: Pa. P. U. C. v. Yablonski, 29 Pa. P. U. C. 509; Pfeifle v. Pa. Power & Light Co., 25 Pa. P. U. C. 52; City of York v. York Bus Co., 32 Pa. P. U. C. 665.\nThe reason assigned by the Commission for its complete disregard of the decisional law of long standing was that the production system was constructed for a dual use, i.e., primarily, the generation of steam for electricity and, secondarily, for steam heat service, and when the use of the system for the generation of electricity was abandoned and devoted only to steam heat service, the price for which the property was acquired was the \u201cfair value . . . for the limited use and service to which it would or could be devoted thereafter.\u201d Such reason finds support neither legally nor factually and furnishes no justification for completely ignoring both the original cost of construction and the cost of reproduction of the utilities devoted exclusively to steam heat service. The Commission order was erroneous both as a matter of law as well as of fact.\nBefore the Superior Court, complaint was made that the Commission erred in failing to base its allowance for annual depreciation upon the original cost of construction. What the Commission actually did was to calculate annual depreciation upon the actual plant investment as found by the Commission, i.e., acquisition cost plus organization expense plus net plant additions or a total of $612,914. The Company, for the purpose of this appeal, does not quarrel with the method of calculating annual depreciation employed by the Commission but rather claims that the annual depreciation should have been based on the original cost of construction. Since the determination of this question depends upon what was the original cost of construction as a factor in determining \u201cfair value\u201d, final determination of the amount of annual depreciation must await the Commission\u2019s action mandated by us to consider the original cost of construction in determining the fair rate base in this case.\nThe Commission\u2019s order herein is palpably erroneous and the Superior Court was eminently correct in reversing that order. However, the judgment of the Superior Court remanded the record to the Commission \u201cfor the entry of an appropriate order not inconsistent with this [the majority] opinion\u201d of the Superior Court. Such a judgment in our view is inappropriate; the Commission should be given an opportunity to reevaluate the entire record in the light of both the majority opinion of the Superior Court and this Court.\nTo that end, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed with the modification that the record be remanded to the Commission so that it may reconsider the entire record and enter an appropriate order.\nJustice Alpern took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nScranton argues that the proposed rate increases vary \u2022 from 30% to 47%. An examination of the record indicates that the overall increase is approximately 20.16%.\nBoiler plant and related structures.\nSteam mains, meters, etc.\nOffice equipment, trucks, etc.\n(2) and (3) are not questioned on this appeal.\nAppellee questions the amount of accrued depreciation in the sense that its figure for accrued depreciation, based on an undepreciated original cost of $4,003,716, is larger.\nNot questioned on this appeal.\nAs modified by certain disallowances made by the Commission."}
