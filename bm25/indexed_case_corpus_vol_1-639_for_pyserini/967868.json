{"id": "967868", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Potter,\nThis was an action of ejectment for the recovery of 106 acres of land in St. Clair township, Westmoreland county, brought by Edwin Patchin and others, who were heirs at law of George Patchin, deceased, against the Seward Coal Company. Upon the trial a verdict for the defendants was directed, and afterwards a motion for judgment non obstante veredicto was refused, and judgment was entered upon the verdict.\nIt appears that on November 26, 1897, George Patchin, a resident of Clearfield county, was declared a lunatic by an inquest held in that county. His son, Edwin Patchin, was appointed his committee, but subsequently resigned, and on January 5, 1900, A. D. Bates was appointed committee in his place. The lunatic owned real estate in Clearfield, Indiana and Westmoreland counties, the latter being the land which is the subject of the present suit in ejectment.\nOn February 23, 1900, A. D. Bates, committee of the lunatic, presented a petition to the court of common pleas of Clearfield county, praying for an order to sell the real estate of the lunatic in Indiana and Westmoreland counties for the payment of his debts and the maintenance and support of himself and his family. An order was made, authorizing and directing the committee to make application to the court of common pleas of Westmoreland county for the sale of the real estate located in its jurisdiction. On March 1,1900, the committee presented a petition to the Westmoreland county court, setting forth the proceedings in Clearfield county and praying for an order to sell the real estate of the lunatic in Westmoreland county. The order was granted and the real estate, being the same land the title to which is in question in the present suit, was sold .by the committee, and the sale was duly confirmed and deed made to the purchaser. The title of the purchaser has, by subsequent conveyances, now become vested in the Seward Coal Company, the defendant and appellee.\nOn October 19,1904, George Patchin died intestate, and the present suit was brought by his heirs at law, to recover possession of the land thus sold and conveyed by his committee. The plaintiffs alleged that the proceedings in Clearfield county were defective and not in compliance with the requirements of the statute. That the court was without jurisdiction because the next of kin were not all notified; that the record did not show the appointment of a guardian ad litem for certain minors. And further, that if the court of Clearfield county did not have jurisdiction to make its order, the court of Westmoreland county acquired no jurisdiction. Plaintiffs maintained that these defects were fatal to the validity of the sale, and that no title passed thereby, and that George Patchin at the time of his death was still the owner of the land.\nThe crucial point in this case, as contended by counsel for appellants, is whether the court of common pleas of Clearfield county had jurisdiction to make the order authorizing the committee of the lunatic to raise the sum of money required. The existence of the jurisdictional facts must be determined by an inspection of the record. \u201cIt is settled law that the facts set out in the petition determine the jurisdiction of the court:\u201d Bennett v. Hayden, 145 Pa. 586. The petition to the Clearfield county court stated that the lunatic had a wife, Agnes Patchin, and nine children, four of whom were minors, and that these were all of the next of kin of said lunatic capable of inheriting his estate. It further set forth as a fact that by the acceptance of service and joinder in the said petition of the wife, and all of the children of said George Patchin except one, they had due notice of the application. It again called attention to the fact that four of the children were minors, and had no guardian, and prayed that a guardian ad litem be appointed at once by the court for these minor children. To this petition was also attached what purported to be the actual acceptance of service by the wife and all the children expept the oldest son, of notice of the application to be made by the committee for the sale of real estate of the said George Patchin. There was also a return that notice of the application had been served on Edwin Patchin, the oldest son of the lunatic, by leaving a true and attested copy thereof with his wife. It further appeared from the petition that this son, Edwin Patchin, had in the first instance been appointed a committee of the person and estate of the said lunatic, but had done nothing to protect the interests of the estate, and thereafter had been superseded as committee by the appointment of the petitioner, A. D. Bates. From this and from other averments appearing in the petition, it is very apparent that the said Edwin Patchin must have been, from the circumstances of the case, and aside from the actual notice given, fully aware of the necessity for the application by the committee for leave to make sale of the said real estate, and of the proceedings in connection therewith. It appears also from the record that in the Westmoreland county petition, it was averred \u201cthat ten days\u2019 notice of this application was given to Agnes Patchin, wife of said lunatic, and to all of his children who were next of- kin.\u201d There was an affidavit of the committee to the same effect, which averred'in addition that the notice was given to the next of kin \u201cpersonally.\u201d In this petition it was also averred that Allison O. Smith had been appointed by the Clearfield county court guardian ad litem of the minor children of George Patchin. From all this we are abundantly satisfied that it does appear that due notice of the intended application for the sale of the real estate was given to the wife and next of kin of the lunatic, capable of inheriting the estate, and that the contention upon the part of the appellants cannot be sustained, that the Clearfield county court was without jurisdiction by reason of the lack of this essential notice. The record does disclose certain irregularities in the proceedings which should have been corrected, or which would have justified the court in setting them aside, had they been brought to its attention in that case, but such defects cannot be raised here in this collateral proceeding. We do not go to the extent of holding as the trial judge apparently did, that without regard to the proceedings in Clearfield county, it was sufficient if it appeared that in some way the wife and next of kin had due notice of the application for the final order of sale made in the Westmoreland county court. We think that under the provisions of the statute the fact that due notice of the intended application had been given to the wife and the next of kin should appear to the court of common pleas having jurisdiction of the accounts of the committee, before it can be called upon to act. Certainly this is true where the real estate is in the same county; and where it is in another county, the sam.e court is to be satisfied of the expediency of a sale-or mortgage of the real estate not within its jurisdiction before it can lawfully authorize the committee to raise the money. Doubtless it is good practice to see that due notice to the wife and next of kin, as required by sec. 24 of the Act of June 13, 1836, P. L. 589, is given of the intended application in both courts. As an examination of the record shows no lack of jurisdictional facts, it follows that parol evidence could not properly have been admitted to impair the effect of the record. The truth of the record, as to matters within the jurisdiction of the court, cannot properly be questioned here. Whatever irregularities existed should have been corrected in the case itself in which they occurred; they are not to be taken up or considered at this time, in a collateral proceeding. We see no merit in any of the assignments of error, and they are therefore dismissed, and the judgment is affirmed."}
