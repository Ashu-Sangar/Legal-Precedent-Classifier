{"id": "946066", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nThe testatrix left the residue of her estate in trust, the dominant intent of which is unquestionably to keep the estate \u201c intact \u201d until after the death of her husband, and to pay one-half of the income to him during the joint lives-of her son and husband, and to the latter in prescribed proportions according to circumstances, should the son die first.\nBy the fourth clause of the will, after the death of the husband all of the estate \u201c and the income accruing therefrom, shall descend to my son,\u201d etc. This meant a fee to the son, but it was contingent on his surviving the husband, for the very next clause is \u201cshould however, my son die before my husband all the estate shall remain intact until after the death of my husband,\u201d and thereupon follows a different division of the income varying according to the survivorship of testatrix\u2019s grandchildren. Then in the sixth clause it is provided that after the death of the husband and son the estate shall remain in trust and the income \u201c shall be for the use of the legitimate children,of my son.\u201d The estate devised to the son, John H. Ritter, was therefore contingent on his surviving his father, and as he died first it never vested. On the death of his father, testatrix\u2019s husband, the estate passed under a dry trust to J ohn\u2019s children. J ohn\u2019s executors had no title to convey and the judgment was rightly entered for the defendant on the case stated.\nJudgment affirmed."}
