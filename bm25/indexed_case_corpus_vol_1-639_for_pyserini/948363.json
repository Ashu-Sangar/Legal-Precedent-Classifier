{"id": "948363", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nThe language of the testator was \u201c To my daughter Mary Frances West, I give, bequeath and devise the farm . . . . known as the Porter farm, during her lifetime, and at her death I direct the same to be divided equally among her children, should she have any living, and in case she should die without living issue, then .... this property shall revert again to my estate.\u201d This is an express gift of a life estate to the daughter with a remainder over at her death to her children \u201c should she have any living \u201d to wit: living at the time of her death. There is no difference in meaning between the words used \u201c should she have any living \u201d and \u201c having issue at the time of her death \u201d which were held in Beckley v. Riegert, 212 Pa. 91, to carry only a life estate to the first devisee. The testator\u2019s intent in both cases is entirely clear to provide for a definite failure of issue at the date of the death of the life tenant, and the present case is even stronger than the other insomuch as the testator uses the word \u201c children \u201d which is prima facie and presumably a word of purchase.\nJudgment affirmed."}
