{"id": "4081458", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nThis asbestos-litigation appeal is being resolved upon mutual consent among the parties, who agree that the order of the Superior Court should be reversed.\nAppellants were manufacturers or distributors of asbestos-containing products and are defendants in litigation initiated by John C. Ravert and later pursued by Appellees as co-executors of Mr. Ravert\u2019s estate. Mr. Ravert and Appellees contended that his exposure to Appellants\u2019 asbestos-containing products caused mesothelioma.\nThe common pleas court awarded summary judgment in favor of Appellants, reasoning that Mr. Ravert\u2019s deposition testimony failed to establish that he breathed asbestos-containing dust from the products manufactured or distributed by Appellants. The court also found expert affidavits submitted by Appellees represented \u201can artificial record which attempts to dehor [Mr. Ravert\u2019s] observation denying the existence of asbestos dust.\u201d\nOn appeal, the Superior Court reversed on the basis that dust may have been invisible to the naked eye, and the expert affidavits were sufficient to establish a material issue of fact as to whether dust emanating from products associated with Appellants was a substantial factor in causing Mr. Ravert\u2019s mesothelioma. See Howard v. A.W. Chesterton Co., 31 A.3d 974, 981, 983 (Pa.Super.2011). The court also reasoned that a plaintiff bears a diminished burden of meeting a frequency, regularity, and proximity threshold of exposure in cases of mesothelioma, since the disease may be caused by limited exposure to asbestos. See id. at 979.\nPresently, Appellees \u201cconcede that the factual record fails to demonstrate regular and frequent enough exposures during which respirable asbestos fibers were shed by [Appellants\u2019] asbestos-containing products to defeat summary judgment.\u201d Brief for Appellees at 10. Furthermore, Appellees:\nrecognize that this Court will not allow Plaintiffs to prove that a plaintiffs exposure to a particular asbestos-containing product is substantially causative of disease by the use of affidavits in which the expert\u2019s methodology is founded upon a belief that every single fiber of asbestos is causative. In Gregg [v. V-J Auto Parts, Inc., 596 Pa. 274, 948 A.2d 216 (2007) ], this Court articulated that the usage of a particular product had to be substantial enough when measured against the totality of the exposures, that the particular product usage was substantial enough to be a factual cause of the disease____The test for adequacy is the comparison of the particular product exposure(s) to the totality of the person\u2019s asbestos exposures.\nBrief for Appellees at 16.\nUpon Appellees\u2019 concession, the opinion of the Superior Court will be vacated and its order reversed. Appellant Monsey Products Company \u2014 in view of its status as a defendant in other cases and the time and expense of this litigation \u2014 asks this Court to reaffirm several governing principles deriving from prior cases. In most respects, these precepts are now well established, and they are relevant to the appropriate disposition of the present case. Accordingly, we are able substantially to accommodate this request. Hence, we reaffirm the following:\n\u2014The theory that each and every exposure, no matter how small, is substantially causative of disease may not be relied upon as a basis to establish substantial-factor causation for diseases that are dose-responsive. See Betz v. Pneumo Alex, LLC, 615 Pa. 504, 44 A.3d 27, 55-58 (2012).\n\u2014Relatedly, in cases involving dose-responsive diseases, expert witnesses may not ignore or refuse to consider dose as a factor in their opinions. See id.\n\u2014Bare proof of some de minimus exposure to a defendant\u2019s product is insufficient to establish substantial-factor causation for dose-responsive diseases. See Gregg v. V-J Auto Parts, Inc., 596 Pa. 274, 943 A.2d 216, 225-26 (2007).\n\u2014Relative to the testimony of an expert witness addressing substantial-factor causation in a dose-responsive disease case, some reasoned, individualized assessment of a plaintiffs or decedent\u2019s exposure history is necessary. See Betz, 44 A.3d at 55-58.\n\u2014Summary judgment is an available vehicle to address cases in which only bare de minimus exposure can be demonstrated and where the basis for the experts testimony concerning substantial-factor causation is the any-exposure theory. See Betz, 44 A.3d at 55-58; Gregg, 943 A.2d at 227.\n\u2014The content of expert discovery is specified in the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure, as may be supplemented by particular directives by courts of original jurisdiction.\nIn her concurring statement, Madame Justice Todd appears to oppose any explanation whatsoever relative to this Order, suggesting that supporting reasons are irrelevant in light of a concession on the merits. See Concurring Statement, op. at 351, 78 A.3d at 610 (\u201cAppellees\u2019 evidentiary concession is the end of the matter[.]\u201d). The concurrence couches the legal precepts which we have set forth above as \u201cunadorned\u201d and \u201cunmoored\u201d from any factual context, while chastising us for violating the axiom that the holding of any case is to be read against its facts. See id. at 351-52, 78 A.3d at 609-11. The concurring statement also discusses the limited effect of a per curiam order and questions the benefit of explanations provided in them. See id. at 351-52, 78 A.3d at 610-11.\nResponsively, we observe that this case was accepted for review on our discretionary docket, briefed, and argued, and we have never understood a party\u2019s merits concession to foreclose the Court\u2019s ability to explicate the ultimate disposition. Furthermore, the relevance of our discussion to the present case is plain and straightforward.\nAs we have explained, Appellees have related that they read and understood the decisions in Gregg and Betz to mean what these decisions say \u2014 namely, that \u201cthis Court will not allow Plaintiffs to prove that a plaintiffs exposure to a particular asbestos-containing product is substantially causative of [an individual plaintiffs particular] disease by the use of affidavits in which the expert\u2019s methodology is founded upon a belief that every single fiber of asbestos is causative.\u201d Brief for Appellees at 16. The main points we have delineated above represent nothing more than a modest elaboration upon this very reasoning supplied by the Appellees themselves in support of their controlling concession. As such, it is difficult to appreciate what additional \u201cadornment\u201d or \u201cmooring\u201d is contemplated by the concurrence.\nCertainly, we do not suggest that a per curiam order has any effect beyond that represented in Justice Todd\u2019s responsive opinion. Nevertheless, in light of the intensely protracted nature of this and other asbestos litigation, as well as our own limited resources, we have acceded to Appellants\u2019 reasonable request to provide whatever limited guidance we were able to supply under the circumstances. Notably, Justice Todd does not substantively question any of the now unremarkable propositions indicated above. Indeed, as explained in detail in the unanimous decision in Betz, the any-exposure opinion is simply unsupportable both as a matter law and science. See Betz, 44 A.3d at 55-58. Our present effort to highlight this proposition while applying it in a case in which it is conceded to be dispositive, we believe, may be of some benefit to Pennsylvania litigants, in terms of crystallizing the essential burdens of proof.\nThe opinion of the Superior Court is VACATED, its order is REVERSED, and the case is remanded for reinstatement of the order of the common pleas court.\nFormer Justice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices SAYLOR, EAKIN, BAER and McCAFFERY join the per curiam order.\nJustice TODD files a concurring statement.\n. For example, the court highlighted that some of the products were used by Mr. Ravert solely in their liquid form.\n. Here, Monsey seeks a particular admonition that expert reports in asbestos cases must contain a discussion of the methodology supporting the expert opinion. There are enough nuances pertaining to this subject that we are unable to make such a general pronouncement here. We recognize, however, that per Rule of Civil Procedure 4003.5(a)(1)(b), a party through interrogatories may require the other party to have identified trial experts state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion. See Pa.R.Civ.P. No. 4003.5(a)(1)(b). The rules also provide latitude for the court of original jurisdiction to order further discovery by other means, subject to specified conditions. See id. No. 4003.5(a)(2).\n. In light of the now settled nature of the above, controlling principles, it is difficult to credit Justice Todd's prediction that they are susceptible to \"summary rejection\u201d in a future opinion.
