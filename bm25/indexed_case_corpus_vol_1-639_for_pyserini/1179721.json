{"id": "1179721", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nPrior to 1902, Ross Street, in the Borough of Tarentum, crossed the tracks of the West Penn Railway at grade. A street car company operated a street railway in Ross Street which was crossed by the steam railroad tracks. These tracks interrupted the continuous operation of the street cars, requiring passengers to walk across the railroad tracks. In 1902 the borough and the street car company made a contract reciting that \u201cthe safety, security and convenience of public travel requires that said railway company shall cross the tracks of the West Penn Railway in said borough above grade,\u201d and providing for the separation of the grades. Pursuant to the contract a bridge or viaduct carrying Ross Street overhead was constructed at the expense of the street railway company. A necessary part of the structure was a stairway for pedestrians affording access to and from the viaduct. The fifth paragraph of the contract provided: \u201cThat the Railway Company will keep viaduct in continuous good condition and repair at its own cost and expense so long as its tracks shall occupy the same. ...\u201d\nPlaintiff, on December 13, 1933, while descending the stairway, fell and was injured as the result of snow and ice on the steps. He sued the defendant street railway company alleging breach of the duty to keep the viaduct in reasonably safe condition for travel and got a verdict. Defendant appeals, contending that it was under no duty either to the borough or to the plaintiff, to remove the snow and ice which caused the injury.\nIn its brief, defendant agrees \u201cthat the viaduct was and is a public street\u201d; that \u201cThe steps in question lead from the viaduct to and connect physically and directly with Fifth Street . . . [and] . . . also, constitute a street or public highway.\u201d In other words, the stairway is part of the viaduct. The abolition of the grade crossing benefited the street railway company; it agreed to keep the viaduct \u201cin continuous good condition and repair at its own cost and expense so long as its tracks shall occupy the same. ...\u201d Defendant says its agreement means that it would keep the structure in repair. The brief puts it in this way: \u201cBoth phrases mean the same thing. \u2018Good condition\u2019 and \u2018good repair\u2019 mean the same thing as \u2018good condition and repair.\u2019 Both words and both phrases mean \u2018to maintain in or restore to a sound state.\u2019 To keep a structure in good condition means to prevent it from falling into decay or dilapidation. To repair means to restore to a good or sound state after decay or dilapidation has occurred.\u201d\nWe think defendant takes too limited a view of the covenant which must be considered in the light of the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract. All the words used must be given effect; the words \u201cgood condition\u201d cannot be eliminated from consideration by saying that in some instances the words \u201cgood repair\u201d may mean the same thing as \u201cgood condition.\u201d What were the circumstances confronting the parties when they dealt with the situation? The movement of street cars was interrupted by the grade crossing of the railroad tracks. But the street car tracks in Boss Street furnished no impediment to pedestrian travel along the sidewalks of the street; pedestrians could pass to and fro at grade. The borough, of course, had certain responsibilities measured by a well recognized standard for the safety of pedestrian travel. By the separation of the grades the street railway company improved its position in obvious respects and for this improvement it assumed certain obligations. The improvement required the stairway; being part of the public highway, the borough was under a duty to pedestrians using the stairs \u2014 the same duty theretofore on the borough with regard to the sidewalks at grade, but one obviously more onerous to the extent that steps require more care than a level sidewalk. The stairway was intended for use and the railway company\u2019s covenant to keep them in \u201cgood condition\u201d must be considered in the light of the use to be made of them, that is, in reasonably safe condition for use by pedestrians exercising due care. So far as structure was concerned, the stairway was not out of repair in the sense that it needed mending, but \u201crepair\u201d also has a more comprehensive significance. In McLaughlin, v. City of Corry, 77 Pa. 109, the accumulation of snow and ice on a sidewalk was spoken of as want of repair.\nWe must reject defendant\u2019s contention that plaintiff, not being a party to the contract, cannot recover against the defendant but must look to the borough. Defendant\u2019s contract to perform the borough\u2019s duty to the public raises defendant\u2019s duty to plaintiff. The borough would of course be liable for failure to perform its duty, but by the contract the primary responsibility of keeping the stairway in good condition for pedestrians is on the street railway company; it cannot complain if a direct demand is made upon it instead of first enforcing what, in view of the contract, may be called the borough\u2019s secondary liability: cf. Dutton v. Lansdowne Borough, 198 Pa. 563, 48 A. 494; Penna. & Ohio Canal Co. v. Graham, 63 Pa. 290; Gates v. Penna. R. R. Co., 150 Pa. 50, 24 A. 638; Hays v. Gallagher, 72 Pa. 136. No other question is involved. It is not disputed that plaintiff was injured by negligence as the verdict establishes.\nJudgment affirmed."}
