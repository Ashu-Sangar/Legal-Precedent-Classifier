{"id": "1183004", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Kephart,\nAppellants borrowed from appellee $20,000 secured by a bond and mortgage on their real estate. Judgment on the bond was confessed against them for $24,622.20 and the real estate sold at sheriff\u2019s sale to appellee for $1,107.95, covering the costs of sale and unpaid taxes. Averring that the fair value of the property was not less than $30,000, appellants petitioned the court below to set aside the sale for gross inadequacy of price. Testimony established that appellants had paid $37,750 for the property, that it was assessed at $23,250 by the City of Pittsburgh, at $19,920 by Allegheny County. Appellants\u2019 expert witnesses estimated its worth as $30,605 and $32,100 respectively, while appellee\u2019s witnesses placed its value at $17,200, $15,480, and $15,000. The court below refused the petition, and from its order as amended this appeal was taken.\nIn this Commonwealth, the principle is established that gross inadequacy of price, on timely application by the mortgagor, furnishes sound basis for setting aside a sheriff\u2019s sale: Hettler v. Shephard, 326 Pa. 165, adopting the rule expressed in Delaware County Nat. Bank v. Miller, 303 Pa. 1, at page 6, and in Beaver County Bldg. & Loan, Assn. v. Winowich, 323 Pa. 483, at page 514. Settler v. Shephard, supra, has been since recognized in Knox v. Noggle, 328 Pa. 302, 305; American State Bank and Trust Co. v. Mariades, 328 Pa. 428, 431; Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation v. Edwards, 329 Pa. 529; Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation v. Eiden, 329 Pa. 532, and Pennsylvania Company, etc., v. Scott, 329 Pa. 534.\nPennsylvania is not alone in this position; the cases cited in the note show that the rule that gross inadequacy of price is sufficient to prompt the court\u2019s exercise of equitable powers has been adopted in other jurisdictions.\nThe determination of the question presented in a petition to set aside a judicial sale is an exercise of discretion, and for its abuse we will reverse on appeal. It is a necessary corollary to Settler v. Shephard, supra, which, as stated above, determined that gross inadequacy of price offers a sound basis for setting aside a sale, that the possibility of abuse of discretion exists as well in refusal to set aside. The exercise of discretion by a court of equity is not an arbitrary or capricious function, but is one directed within the channels of precedent. See Sullivan v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Co., 208 Pa. 540, 554; Asbury v. Carroll, 54 Pa. Superior Ct. 97, 102; Osborn v. United States Bank, 22 U. S. 738, 866; Willard v. Tayloe, 75 U. S. 557, 567. Where the discrepancy between the value of the property and the price realized at the sale is so great as to come within the rule established by previous decisions of this Court, the mortgagor is entitled to have the sale set aside. Since the disproportion between value and price realized is here markedly more pronounced than in Settler v. Shephard, supra, the refusal of the court helow to set aside the sale for gross inadequacy was an abuse of discretion.\nAppellee argues that federal and state constitutional provisions forbidding the impairment of contracts deter the court\u2019s setting aside of the sale. But that constitutional restriction does not apply to judicial decisions: Sinking Fund Commissioners of Philadelphia v. Philadelphia, 324 Pa. 129, 133, and cases there cited. See also McCoy v. Union Elevated Railroad Co., 247 U. S. 354. The effect of this exercise of judicial discretion is primarily not upon the right but upon the remedy. See Sinking Fund Commissioners of Philadelphia v. Philadelphia, supra, at page 139 of the concurring opinion.\nOrder reversed with a procedendo.\nSee Federal Title & Mtg. Guaranty Co. v. Lowenstein, 113 N. J. Eq. 200; Better Plan B. & L. Assn. v.
