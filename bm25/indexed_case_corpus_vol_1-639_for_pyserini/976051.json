{"id": "976051", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn the opinion of the court below, sustaining the demurrer to the appellant\u2019s bill, his proceeding is not inaptly termed \u201cunique, if not anomalous.\u201d His complaint is that the action of the court in dismissing his original bill was \u201cmanifestly erroneous,\u201d though affirmed by this court; and his prayer is that the court below correct our error, as well as its own, by reversing the decree made three years ago: Ricketts v. Capwell, 228 Pa. 268. Even if the demurrer is fairly open to criticism as a \u201cspeaking\u201d one, there is sufficient in it to constitute it a good one, calling for tlie dismissal of the bill. On its face the complainant shows no right to what he prays for.\nAppeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
