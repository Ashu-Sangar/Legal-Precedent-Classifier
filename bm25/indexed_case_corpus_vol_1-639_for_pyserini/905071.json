{"id": "905071", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe are not convinced that the learned trial court erred in refusing to affirm plaintiff\u2019s first and second points, or in directing a verdict in favor of the defendants. The first three specifications of error are therefore overruled.\nThere was no error in sustaining defendant\u2019s objections to the offers of evidence recited in the fourth and last specification.\nWhen this case was here before on the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the refusal of the court below to enter judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense (187 Pa. 108), the principles involved were considered and decided. It is unnecessary to repeat what we said then, or to add anything thereto.\nJudgment affirmed."}
