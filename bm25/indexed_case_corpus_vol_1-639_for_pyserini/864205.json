The testimony tending to prove the genuineness of the disputed signatures, was quite sufficient to warrant the findings of which the decree is predicated; and, in the absence of manifest error in either of said findings of fact, the decree should not be disturbed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by the appellant."}
