It was a lot of ground, held by one title, and undivided by any lines, with two buildings on it. We cannot say there was any error in applying to it the ordinary rule for assessing damages in this class of cases, to wit; the difference in the value of the whole before and after the injury;\nJudgment affirmed."}
