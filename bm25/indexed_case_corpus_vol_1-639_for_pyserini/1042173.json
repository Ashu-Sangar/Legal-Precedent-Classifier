{"id": "1042173", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nMary Lane claimed compensation, under the Act of June 2, 1915, P. L. 736, for the alleged accidental death of her husband, an employee of defendant; the claim was allowed by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board, and this decision was affirmed by the court below; defendant has appealed.\nUpon the facts involved, Commissioner Scott says: \u201cThis case comes before the board on a petition for determination of compensation due the claimant under agreed facts. The statement of facts precludes any other cause of death than that of heat exhaustion or prostration due to the heated condition of the atmosphere. The claimant\u2019s deceased husband was overcome by heat while working at the defendant\u2019s lunch counter, on a hot August day in 1917, and died within two hours. There is nothing in the statement to show that [the temperature of] the place where the employee was working was hotter than the outside atmosphere, or that he'was affected by different heat conditions than prevailed in the community at large.\u201d\nOn the governing rules of law, the commissioner correctly states: \u201cThe term \u2018personal injury\u2019 in our act is confined to injuries of accidental origin and such dise\u00e1ses as naturally result therefrom, and must be held to include any form of bodily harm or incapacity [accidentally] caused by [either] external violence or physical force......A stroke by lightning, a stroke from the direct rays of the sun, a heat stroke, or heat prostration, are untoward, unexpected mishaps and accidental injuries within the meaning of the act.....It is immaterial whether the heat prostration is produced by artificial heat or by the natural heat of the sun, directly or through the heated atmosphere, if the exhaustion comes from heat in the course of employment.\u201d\nIn cases such as the one at bar, the character and cause of the injury must be considered in order to determine whether the results complained of are properly attributable to \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of that term as used in-the Act of June 2,1915, P. L. 736, supra; for wherever death is mentioned in the statute, it means death resulting only from unforeseen violence to the physical structure of the body and its resultant effects (Section 301, P. L. 738), or, in other words, death from \u201can accident\u201d happening in the course of the deceased person\u2019s employment, as distinguished from either ordinary or occupational disease developed during the course of such employment, these latter not being within contemplation of the act. This subject is fully discussed in McCauley v. Imperial Woolen Co., 261 Pa. 312.\nThe learned commissioner is not without authority in holding heat prostration, under circumstances such as those at bar, to fall within the meaning of the word \u201caccident\u201d as that term is employed in modern compensation legislation; and, we may add, as it is used in the law of insurance. In Ismay, Imrie & Co. v. Williamson, Law Rep. A. C. 1908, 437, 439, Lord Loreburn, speaking for the House of Lords, said: \u201cThis man died from an accident. What killed him was a heat stroke coming suddenly and unexpectedly upon him while at work. Such a stroke is an unusual effect of a known cause, often, no doubt, threatened, but generally averted by precautions, which experience, in this instance, had not taught. It was an unlooked for mishap in -the course of his employment. In common language, it was a case of accidental death.\u201d See also Maskery v. Lancashire Shipping Co., decided by the' Court of Appeals, England, and reported in Butterworth\u2019s Workmen\u2019s Compensation Cases, Volume 7, pp. 428, 430, where the engineer on a steamship met his death from a heat stroke while crossing the Red sea. The contention of defendants was that they were not liable \u201cbecause the Red sea is always very hot, and there was no special heat on that particular day more than people in the engine-room going through the Red sea would ordinarily be exposed to.\u201d In affirming an allowance of compensation, the court held that the Ismay case applied; and the opinion refers to the heat stroke as \u201can occurrence which was in its nature fortuitous.\u201d Andrew v. Failsworth Industrial Society, 90 Law Times Reports (new series), pp. 611, 612, involves death from a stroke of lightning; Pack v. Prudential Casualty Co., 170 Ky. 47, 55, death from sunstroke, and McGlinchey et al. v. Fidelity Casualty Co., 80 Me. 251, 253, death from fright \u2014 all held to be accidental; while N. W. Commercial Travelers\u2019 Assn. v. London Guarantee & Accident Co., 10 Manitoba Rep. (Queen\u2019s Bench) 537, holds death from frost to be within the terms \u201cbodily injuries effected through external, violent and accidental means.\u201d Finally, N. A. Life & Accident Ins. Co. v. Burroughs, 69 Pa. 43, 51, a case where an assured strained himself while loading hay, defines \u201caccident\u201d as \u201can event that takes place without one\u2019s foresight or expectation ......; an accident signifies happening by chance or unexpectedly,......casual [or] fortuitous.\u201d Of course, neither this last ruling nor any other of the insurance cases mentioned can be looked upon as governing the present compensation claim; but all are illustrative of the liberal views entertained by the courts as to the meaning of the term \u201caccident\u201d in determining liability for death or personal injury.\nSection 422 of the Act of 1915, supra (P. L. 753), provides that the facts on which a claim for compensation depends may be agreed upon, and, in that event, tbe \u201cpetition shall contain the agreed, facts and shall be signed by all parties in interest.\u201d Section 425 (P. L. 754) provides that, on an appeal to the courts, such agreement shall be included in the transcript, or record, sent up for consideration. In the present instance the agreement itself has not been physically brought before us, as it should be, but the commissioner\u2019s findings are that the statement of facts contained therein \u201cprecludes any other cause of death than that of heat exhaustion or prostration, due to the heated condition of the atmosphere\u201d ; hence we must take it no organic weakness or occupational disease can be accounted the proximate cause of the death of claimant\u2019s husband, but the casualty was attributable solely to the unexpected and violent effect of the heat upon the physical structure of deceased\u2019s body; and this was properly held by the compensation board and the court below to be an accidental death within the meaning of the act.\nAppellant\u2019s contention that \u201cthe whole intent of this legislation [compensation law] is based upon the theory that the employment in which the person is engaged is the proximate cause of the injury,\u201d is without merit. In, this connection it is sufficient to call attention to Dzikowska v. Superior Steel Co., 259 Pa. 578, 581; there the deceased, during an intermission in his work, while waiting for material, struck a match for the purpose of lighting a cigarette, and, as a result, his clothing ignited and he was fatally burned. We sustained an award in favor of the widow, and said, inter alia: \u201cIn the compensation acts of some of the states, compensation is allowed only for injuries Arising out of and in the course of his employment,\u2019 thus attaching two conditions to the right to recover. In the Pennsylvania statute, the words Arising out of\u2019 do not appear; and we are, therefore, relieved from the necessity of considering the question whether in this case the accident arose, out of, or was due to the character, of, the employment. Under our statute compensation is given for personal injury or death of an employee 'by an accident in the course of bis employment.\u2019 \u201d\nIn the present case, the court below rightly held that claimant\u2019s husband died from an accident happening in the course of his employment, within the meaning of the Act of 1915.\nThe assignments of error are overruled, and the judgment sustaining the allowance of compensation is affirmed."}
