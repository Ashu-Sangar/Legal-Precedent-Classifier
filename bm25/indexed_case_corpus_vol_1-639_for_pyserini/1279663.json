{"id": "1279663", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nPlaintiff, a manufacturer of air cooling units, brought an action in assumpsit against the defendant distributor to recover $3,929.88 with interest for goods sold and delivered. Distributor admitted the debt, but alleging the breach of an oral contract for the exclusive sale and distribution of Manufacturer\u2019s products, counterclaimed for $22,682.78 which sum represented commissions allegedly due her on sales made in her territory in 1954 directly by Manufacturer.\nThe issue of the existence of the alleged contract was submitted to a jury which returned a verdict in favor of Distributor on her counterclaim in the amount of $11,300. After Manufacturer\u2019s motions for judgment n.o.v. and, in the alternative, for a new trial were dismissed by the court en bane, this appeal was taken.\nViewing the evidence and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the Distributor, we hold that the oral agreement Avas not an enforceable contract.\nAlthough Distributor\u2019s business dealings with Manufacturer began in 1947, the manager of Distributor\u2019s business testified that the parol arrangements creating the exclusive distributorship were made with Manufacturer\u2019s sales director at a meeting in Pittsburgh sometime between 1950 and 1952. By the terms of the agreement Distributor was granted an exclusive franchise to sell Manufacturer\u2019s appliances to dealers within a radius of \u201capproximately\u201d 150 or 200 miles of the Borough of Yandergrift. No effective date for this agreement was specified, neither was the duration of the franchise fixed. In the event that Manufacturer sold air coolers directly to dealers within the territory, Distributor was to be paid a commission on each unit sold equal to \u201cmore or less\u201d the difference between the distributor and dealer costs. It is upon this provision that Distributor bases her counterclaim for commissions on the sales made directly by Manufacturer in 1954.\nAlthough the terms of the oral agreement are vague and indefinite, Manufacturer\u2019s obligations thereunder were to sell its products exclusively through Distributor in the area covered by the franchise, and to pay Distributor a commission on all appliances sold directly to dealers therein. But what was Distributor\u2019s undertaking?\nDistributor was under no duty to purchase any of Manufacturer\u2019s air cooling units. She did not agree to refrain from selling the air conditioning appliances of competitors, or from selling Manufacturer\u2019s appliances outside her territory. As a matter of fact, Distributor did not even promise to invest either her time, money or effort to promote the sale of Manufacturer\u2019s products; Distributor\u2019s witness testified that such matters were left entirely to her discretion. In this regard the record indicates that she continued to engage in the plumbing and heating business at her establishment in addition to marketing Manufacturer\u2019s air cooling units. In short, Distributor\u2019s obligations under the oral agreement were illusory and capable of performance without detriment to herself or benefit to Manufacturer. This lack of consideration relieves Manufacturer from any obligation under the oral agreement for the exclusive sale and distribution of Manufacturer\u2019s products. P. P. Williams Co. v. Colorado Milling and Elevator Co., 246 F. 2d 240, 244-245 (5th cir. 1957); Motor Car Supply Co. v. General Household Utilities Co., 80 F. 2d 167, 170 (4th cir. 1935). Cf. Moon Motor Car Co. of N. Y. v. Moon Motor Co., 29 F. 2d 3, 4 (2nd cir. 1928) (opinion by L. Hand, C. J.).\nAccordingly, the court below should have entered judgment on plaintiff\u2019s claim and judgment n.o.v. on defendant\u2019s counterclaim.\nJudgment for defendant reversed. Judgment here entered for plaintiff n.o.v.\nUnder these circumstances the agreement would be effective for a reasonable time and thereafter terminable at will by either party providing notice of termination first be given.

George E. Keith, 30 P. 2d 90 (3rd cir. 1929). As to what constitutes a reasonable time, see Carlson v. Stone-Ordean-Wells Co., 40 Mont. 434, 107 Pac. 419 (1910) ; Saddlery Hardware Mfg. Co. v. Hillsborough Mills, 68 N.H. 216, 44 Atl. 300 (1894) ; Curtiss Candy Co. v. Silberman, 45 F. 2d 451 (6th cir. 1930) (seller\u2019s promise not to sell to others incident to sales contract held enforceable for the time which purchaser reasonably requires to dispose of goods taken under the contract). Cf. Cummings v. Kelling Nut Co., 368 Pa. 448, 455-456, 84 A. 2d 323 (1951) (contract of agency or employment without a specific duration is presumed to be terminable at will and burden is upon the party asserting otherwise to come forward with evidence to establish a definite tenure.)\nAlthough Distributor\u2019s manager testified that such commissions were to be paid on orders which were turned over to Manufacturer as too large to handle, he also stated in a letter sent to Manufacturer and introduced in evidence: \u201cRemember . . . you also promised me that I would get a percentage of anything you sold in my territory.\u201d\nUnder the circumstances of this case, we are not warranted in implying promises by Distributor to do or refrain from doing any of the acts suggested in the text as supplying consideration for Manufacturer\u2019s promises. See International Shoe Co. v. Herndon, 135 S.C. 138, 133 S.E. 202 (1926).\n\u201cWe do not overlook . . . [the principle of promissory estoppel as set forth in Restatement, Contracts \u00a790]. But we do not consider this such a case. This growing doctrine of the law is founded upon the injustice and hardship arising from the justifiable reliance of the promisee upon the promise, should such promise be held unenforceable for want of consideration. Here the evidence discloses no such hardship upon or unfairness toward the plaintiffs, nor unremunerated services, nor expenditures by them of such substantial character as would justify the application of the principle reforred to.\u201d Curtiss Candy Co. v. Silberman, 45 F. 2d 451, 453 (6th cir. 1930).\nAlthough the distribution of a manufacturer\u2019s products on a national scale is made possible by modern technology, it still requires the establishment of relationships with local distributors. Controversies arising under these relationships are usually litigated in the federal courts because of diversity of citizenship.\nFor an analysis of the problem of consideration as it pertains to these sales agency or sales distribution relationships, see Note, 31 Colum. L. Rev. 830 (1931)."}
