{"id": "473084", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nJohn S. Clark died July 16, 1885, aged 65 years. At the time of his death, Mr. Clark\u2019s youngest child was 21 years of age and his oldest grandchild was 17 years of age. His widow\u2019s name was Catherine M. Clark; she died on August 1, 1914. Mr. and Mrs. Clark had nine children. Three sons and one daughter died without issue; five children had issue on March 27, 1947 when testator\u2019s last surviving child, Mary J. Paul died. Clark\u2019s will was made on May 7,1878, or nearly 69 years before his last child died.\nEmily C. Fairman, a Clark child, died on September 22,1943. Surviving her was one son, Robert C. Fairman, and three grandchildren who were Mary Emily Sailer Gardiner, Anna Reisky Sailer Zullinger, and Franklin Fairman Sailer. Robert C. Fairman died without issue on July 29, 1946. The three grandchildren Emily C. Fairman left are children of her daughter, Mary Fair-man Sailer, who died on December 18,1914. These three grandchildren were of course testator\u2019s great-grandchildren.\nCatherine M. McKnight, another Clark child, died July 2,1909, leaving to survive her two children: Anna McKnight Hetzel, who died July 7,1937, and William C. McKnight, who died June 17, 1943. Anne McKnight Hetzel left a son, William E. McKnight, Jr. William C. McKnight left to survive him two children, George J. McKnight and James W. McKnight, all three being great-grandchildren of the testator.\nSarah J. Hood, another Clark child, died February 6, 1921, leaving children and grandchildren; John S. Clark, Jr., died November 20,1937, leaving children and grandchildren; and Mary Janet Paul died March 27, 1947, leaving only two children to survive her.\nTestator in his last Will and Testament left his entire estate in Trust and gave to his wife the entire income from said trust until the youngest child attained the age of twenty-one and thereafter directed that his wife was to have one-half of the income and the other half was to be equally divided among his children. He then provided as follows: \u201cSECOND. . . . Upon the death or marriage of my wife, the whole income of my Estate shall be equally divided among my children during their respective lives; but should any of my children die leaving a child or children, then such child, or children shall take such portion of the income of my Estate as the parent of such child, or children would have taken if living. But should any of my children die, leaving no children, then the portion of the income of my Estate given to such child shall be equally divided among the survivors of my children, and the child or children of those who are dead; the child or children of a deceased child, or children, to take by right of representation as above provided. . . .\u201d\n\u201cTHIRD \u2014 Should my said wife marry, then she shall take only so much of my Estate as she would have been entitled to under the laws of this Commonwealth if I had died intestate. And in that event, subject to my said wife\u2019s interest under said laws, my Executors shall apply the whole income of my Estate to the use of my Children, dividing said income, during their lives equally between them and the child or children of those of my children who may be dead; the child or children of such deceased child or children shall however, only take such portion of said income as his, her, or their parent or parents would have taken if living; as I have hereinbefore directed and provided. After the death of all my children, then my Estate shall be equally divided among their living children \u2014 per stirpes \u2014 that is, they shall take by representation of their parents respectively and not per capita\u201d. (Italics supplied.)\nOn August 3, 1938, sur the Eighth Account, Judge Ladner held that upon the death of Anna McKnight Hetzel (daughter of Catherine M. McKnight, a daughter of decedent) the income which she had been receiving during her lifetime should continue to be paid to her son, William E. Hetzel, Jr., testator\u2019s great-grandson. This ruling was based on the finding that a reading of the entire Will showed that testator\u2019s use of the word \u201cchildren\u201d was in the sense of \u201cissue\u201d and that this was confirmed by the \u201capplicable authorities\u201d and hence the great-grandson took his deceased mother\u2019s share in the trust estate.\nOn January 6, 1944, sur the Ninth Account, Judge Hunter similarly held that upon the death of Emily C. Fairman (daughter of decedent), her grandchildren, children of her daughter, Mary Fairman Sailer, who predeceased her, i. e., great-grandchildren of the testator, were entitled to participate, along with her son, in the one-fifth share of income which their grandmother had been receiving during her lifetime. Judge Hunter decided that the manifest general intent of Mr. Clark\u2019s will was to send the share of each of his children (in equal shares) down in the line of her (and his) blood, per stirpes, and that he used the word \u201cchildren\u201d (in the gift of income to his children\u2019s children) in the sense of \u201cissue\u201d and hence that, under the language of Mr. Clark\u2019s Will and the applicable authorities, the three great-grandchildren were entitled to the share of income which their mother would have received had she survived her parent.\nOn June 30, 1947, sur the Tenth Account, Judge Bolger held that upon the death of Robert C. Fairman on July 29, 1946, without leaving issue to survive him, that his one-tenth share of income, which accrued after his death and until termination of the Trust by the death of Mary Janet Paul on March 27, 1947, should remain, in the Fairman family line and go to the three grandchildren of Emily C. Fairman, they being her surviving issue and great-grandchildren of the testator, rather than to revert back to the corpus of the Trust.\nThe contest before us is one between grandchildren (appellants) and great-grandchildren (appellees). The grandchildren ask us to exclude from any share of the trust estate amounting to $940,512.37 the great-grandchildren. These latter constitute 52 percent of all of the testator\u2019s living descendants. These 52 percent belong to two of the five lines of direct descendants of testator. All descendants of testator have been receiving income from the trust estate during the period of the trust. No exceptions were filed to the adjudications awarding them such income.\nThe trust did not terminate until Mary Janet Paul died on March 3, 1947. At that time the question of the distribution of the principal came before the court for the first time. Judge Bolger held on June 30, 1947, that the thirteen living great-grandchildren of the testator should participate in the distribution of the principal together with John S. Clark\u2019s nine living grandchildren. This decision was based on the finding that the term \u201cchildren\u201d should be construed to mean \u201cissue\u201d and that, therefore, great-grandchildren should be included in the distribution. Exceptions to this adjudication were filed in behalf of the nine living grandchildren and the Orphans\u2019 Court in an opinion by Judge Hunter dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the adjudication absolutely. On January 27, 1948, the Schedule of Distribution was approved and filed and thereafter, nine appeals were duly taken on behalf of the living grandchildren.\nThe decree appealed from is based principally upon the authority of Disston Estate, 349 Pa. 129, 36 A. 2d 457, and Campbell\u2019s Estate, 202 Pa. 459, 51 A. 1099. This Court interpreted the following clause in testatrix\u2019s will in Disston Estate, supra: \u201cUpon the death of the survivor of my sons and of their respective wives, I direct that my estate shall be divided among my grandchildren then living, per stirpes and not per capita, and this trust shall thereupon cease and determine\u201d and we held that the expression \u201cgrandchildren then living, per stirpes\u201d was sufficiently comprehensive to include testatrix\u2019s great-grandchildren. We said: \u201cThe rule in such cases is, as Judge Gest said in Williamson\u2019s Estate, 3 D. & C. 1, adopted by the Superior Court, 82 Pa. Superior Ct. 444, 446, that \u2018. . . such a broad interpretation will not be given to the bequest, unless it clearly appears from the context to have been the meaning of the testator, or unless the will would otherwise be inoperative.\u2019 \u201d\nThe testator\u2019s will in Campbell\u2019s Estate, supra, contained a provision that \u201cin case of the decease of either or any of my said daughters without leaving any children surviving at the time of her decease then her share so dying to go to and be equally divided amongst her surviving brothers and sisters and the children of such of them as may then be dead per stirpes.\u201d In interpreting this clause, we held that although the word \u201cchildren\u201d ordinarily does not include grandchildren the \u201cmanifest general intent of his [testator\u2019s] will was to send the shares of each of his daughters respectively down in the line of her and his blood per stirpes.\u201d It added: \u201cthis whole provision in his will shows that he used the word \u2018children\u2019 in the sense of issue, a sense which as remarked by the learned auditing judge, is sanctioned by the lexicographers and by the decisions in Haldeman v. Haldeman, 40 Pa. 29, and Potts v. Cline, 174 Pa. 513.\u201d\nAppellants contend that the words \u201ctheir living children\u201d, refer to the living children of testator\u2019s deceased children, that is, \u201cliving offspring of testator\u2019s deceased offspring, or grandchildren.\u201d They say that the term \u201cparents\u201d and \u201cthey\u201d and \u201ctheir\u201d imply \u201cthe testator\u2019s deceased children only\u201d.\nIt is a rule of law that sentence structure and grammatical construction are never allowed to defeat the general intention of the testator as evidenced by the provisions of the will in its entirety. The terminology employed by the testator in Campbell\u2019s Estate, supra, is similar to the use in the will now being construed. The pronoun \u201cthem\u201d in the phrase \u201cthe children of such of them\u201d in Campbell\u2019s Estate modifies its antecedent \u201csurviving brothers and sisters\u201d. Under a narrow literalness of construction, the issue of testator\u2019s children would have been barred from taking under Campbell\u2019s will, but this Court rejected such a construction and as a result none of testator\u2019s lineal descendants was disinherited. In Ziegler Estate, 356 Pa. 93, 51 A. 2d 608, where testator provided that his estate should be \u201cdivided unto my six children or their lawful heirs . . . But if the Daughter of my deceased son . . . should die without children in such case all the money she drew out of my estate shall fall back to my other children now living or their lawful heirs,\u201d it was held that testator intended the remainder interest to vest in the children of the daughter, or their issue, and did not intend to restrict the class to his grandchildren living at her death, and that the word \u201cchildren\u201d was intended by the testator to mean \u201cissue\u201d. Mr. Justice Patterson speaking for this Court said: \u201cAs in all cases where this Court is interpreting a will, it is the actual intent of the testator, as ascertained from the language of his will which must prevail: Keefer Estate, 353 Pa. 281, 45 A. 2d 31. . . . The law leans toward equality among heirs and vested rather than contingent remainders: Edelman\u2019s Estate, 276 Pa. 503, 120 A. 457. . . . Testator\u2019s scheme being clearly of a family or a per stirpes distribution, and the word \u2018children\u2019 manifestly having been employed in a broad sense, rather than a technical one, the court below properly awarded one-half of the balance of the estate to G. Robert Hanley, appellant, and one-half to Marguerite H. Gifford, appellee.\u201d\nOur opinion in Jackson\u2019s Estate, 337 Pa. 561,12 A. 2d 338, 129 A. L. R. 819, sets forth certain \u201caccredited canons\u201d which are applicable in interpreting wills, to wit: \u201c(1) \u2018The law will impute to a testator\u2019s words such a meaning as, under all the circumstances, will conform to his probable intention and be most agreeable to reason and justice:\u2019 Johnson v. Brasington, 156 N. Y. 181, 185, 50 N. E. 859 [860], (2) \u2018In determining the testator\u2019s intention the court should place itself as nearly as possible in his position, and hence . . . should take into consideration the situation of the testator and the facts and circumstances surrounding him at the time the will was executed . . ., the state of the property devised,\u2019 the amount and character of the property of the testator when he made his will (McGlathery\u2019s Estate, 311 Pa. 351,166 A. 886 [887]), and \u2018the testator\u2019s relation to the beneficiaries, their condition or necessities :\u2019 69 C. P., p. 63, sec. 1120.\u201d The application of these canons to the will now before us leads to the conclusion that although the terminology employed by the will is susceptible of two interpretations, it is more \u201cagreeable to reason and justice\u201d to reject the narrow interpretation of the word \u201cchildren\u201d contended for by appellants and hold that the word \u201cchildren\u201d as used in the third paragraph of the will in connection with the phrase \u201cper stirpes, that is, they shall take by representation of their parents, respectively, and not per capita\u201d includes the grandchildren of testator\u2019s immediate children. When a testator directs, as did this testator, that after the death of all his children, his estate shall be divided among \u201ctheir living children, per stirpes\u201d, he Avas obviously thinking of his descendants as thejy stemmed from his children and he directed that they take his estate by \u201crepresentation of their parents, respectively, and not per capita.\u201d\nAppellants contend that the per stirpital distribution stopped with testator\u2019s grandchildren. We cannot accept this contention when we give due regard to the natural impulses and feelings of mankind and consideration for the general laws of descent and rules for the disposition of estates in determining the testator\u2019s intention for the purpose of construing a will. See Runyan v. Rivers, 99 Ind. App. 680, 192 N. E. 327. It is a well recognized canon that where language is equivocal a construction enuring to the benefit of remote lineal descendants is preferred to one which favors immediate issue exclusively. When Clark died he had no great grandchildren living. He must have realized that when his trust would terminate he would be likely to have some great-grandchildren and it is inconceivable that he would intend that if the parents of these great-grandchildren were dead upon the trust\u2019s termination they would not take as representatives their parents\u2019 fair share of the estate.\nIn Ball v. Weightman et al., 273 Pa. 120, it was held that the term \u201cgrandchildren\u201d may or may not embrace great-grandchildren according to the meaning of the testator to be ascertained from an examination of the entire will. The Court in its opinion said: \u201cStanding alone it [grandchildren] is restricted to children\u2019s children, but it may be enlarged by the context so as to embrace great-grandchildren or even more remote descendants. Where there is something to extend the natural signification of the term \u2018grandchildren\u2019 it may include great-grandchildren: Horn v. Van Schaick, 3 Barbour\u2019s Chancery Reports 488, 508; see also the opinion of the late Judge Hawkins, In re Estate of Andrew Morton, 32 Pitts. L. J. (N. S.) 406. In the language of Yeates, J., in the leading case of Pemberton v. Parke et al., 5 Binney 601, 609, \u2018Grandchildren are words of equivocal import, and may or may not include great-grandchildren, according to the sense in which they may have been used by a testator, collected from the whole of his will.\u2019 \u201d\nA case similar to the one at bar is that of Rieck et al. v. Richards et al., 178 N. E. 276 (Ohio), where the testator provided in his will, inter alia: \u201cupon the death of my wife the whole of the said net income of my estate shall be thus divided among my children, and upon the death of any of my children leaving issue, his or her child or children shall succeed to the father or mother\u2019s share, and upon the death of the last survivor of my children, the trust herein created shall cease, and my estate vest in my grandchildren, per stirpes and not per capita.\u201d A great-granddaughter of the testator claimed that she should share in the income and distribution of the estate. This claim was contested by the grandchildren. The Court of Appeals of Ohio in awarding a portion of the estate to the great-granddaughter said: \u201c. . . the well-settled rules of construction require us to ascertain the intention of the testator from the language of the will, giving, if possible, to the words used a meaning that will avoid intestacy, vesting the interests at as early a date as is consistent with the expressed intention of the testator, and withal remembering that we are not forced to give language a technical construction unless the intent of the will clearly requires it, and that words are flexible and capable of many shades of meaning. ... We are also called upon to construe the meaning of that portion of the will disposing of the corpus of the estate, \u2018and upon the death of the last survivor of my children, the trust herein created shall cease, and my estate vest in my grandchildren, per stirpes and not per capita.\u2019 Here, again, a rigid construction of the word \u2018grandchildren,\u2019 as meaning the children of the testator\u2019s children, only produces results which we consider wholly contrary to the testator\u2019s intention. Manifestly there can be no vesting of the corpus until the death of the last child of the testator. Again we revert to the whole will and conclude that it is manifest that the testator wished the .shares of his children to descend to the \u2018issue\u2019 \u2014 the lineal descendants \u2014 of his children, to his \u2018grandchildren,\u2019 without regard to any number of prefixes, great or great-great. As a general rule the word \u2018grandchildren\u2019 is a word of definite meaning, limited to children of children; but where the manifest intention of the testator, as gained from the whole will, requires an extension of the meaning past the strict limitations, a court of chancery is amply warranted, and is, in fact, required, to so extend the meaning.\u201d\nIt must be taken for granted that during the seven years which elapsed between the making of the Clark will and its becoming operative at the time of its maker\u2019s death, Mr. Clark knew that the corpus of the trust fund he created would not be divided among his heirs until after the lapse of a long period of time (in fact it proved to be 69 years after the date of the will). It must also be assumed that he knew that at the time the corpus would be divided there would probably be not only grandchildren but also great-grandchildren and that there was at least a natural likelihood that the Clark-blooded parents of some of these great-grandchildren might not then be living.\nIt is inconceivable that with all this within the testator\u2019s reasonable contemplation he ever intended (1) that in the contingency stated (and which actually came to pass) the great-grandchildren would be denied that fair share of the Clark estate which so clearly would have been their Clark-blooded parents\u2019 share had these parents been living at the time of the termination of the trust, and (2) that the portion thus denied the great-grandchildren under a narrow construction of the terms of the will Vould be added to the portions of the grandchildren who were first cousins once removed of the great-grandchildren.\nNo court will adopt a testamentary construction which will bring about such an unnatural and inequitable distribution of testator\u2019s property unless the language of the will unequivocally requires it. The language of this will makes no such requirement. When the testator provided for the distribution of his trust estate among \u201cthe living children\u201d of his deceased children \u201cper stirpes \u2014 that is, . . . by representation of their parents, respectively . . .\u201d, he obviously intended to include in the term \u201ctheir living children\u201d not only the second generation of children after him but also the third generation.\nJudge Hunter in his opinion for the court below said: \u201cThe main reliance of the present adjudication is upon Disston Estate, 349 Pa. 129, where the phrase \u2018per stirpes and not per capita\u2019, following a designation of \u2018grandchildren\u2019, conveyed the sense that \u2018grandchildren\u2019 was intended to mean \u2018issue\u2019. Disston Estate, in the emphasis which it gives to the phrase \u2018per stirpes\u2019, is a further abatement and relaxation of the rule excluding remote issue, . . .\u201d When Disston\u2019s Estate was before this Court, Mr. Justice Allen M. Stearns did not sit because he had been a member of the court from which the appeal was taken. In that case he, as a member of the lower court, was one of a majority of five who held that the language of Disston\u2019s will was such as to give to the great-grandchildren the right to share per stirpes with grandchildren. When the case was heard before us, we divided three to three on the question. We said: \u201cThe order appealed from is therefore affirmed.\u201d The controlling words in Disston Estate are heretofore quoted in this opinion. Their resemblance to the controlling words in the instant case is so close as to make the decision in the Disston case the law in this case.\nThe decree is affirmed; costs to be paid by the appellants.\nWhen Thomas Fuller in Gnomoloyia wrote \u201cWe are all Adam\u2019s children\u201d, he did not mean thereby that we are Cain and Abel and when Shakespeare in Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost wrote of \u201cour grandmother, Eve\u201d, he did not mean that he was the third generation in descent from \u201cthe first parents\u201d and when in Henry VIII he used the lines:\n\u201cOur children\u2019s children Shall see this and bless heaven\u201d\nhe apparently had no intention of depriving heaven of the \u201cblessing\u201d of preaf-grandchildren."}
