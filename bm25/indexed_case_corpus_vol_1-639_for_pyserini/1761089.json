{"id": "1761089", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellant, James Watts, was convicted in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia of murder of the first degree and criminal conspiracy. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life for murder and five to ten years for conspiracy, the sentences to run concurrently. He appealed the judgment of sentence for murder to this court and appealed the judgment of sentence for conspiracy to the Superior Court, which certified that appeal to this court.\nAppellant was charged in connection with the shooting death of Andre Washington, whose body was discovered in the front seat of a car on Vertel Road in Philadelphia at 1:35 a. m., on September 24, 1974.\nElliot Burton, a prosecution witness, testified as follows: Decedent, for several weeks prior to his death, had been trying to be admitted to the Twentieth and Carpenter Street Gang, of which Burton and appellant were members. Donald Robinson, the leader of the gang, suspected decedent was a spy for a rival gang. During the evening of September 23, 1974, Robinson arranged for appellant and gang members Albie Sims and Jeffry Johnson to kill decedent. The three were to take decedent out on the pretext they were initiating him into the gang. They were to go in two cars, one of which belonged to Robinson and one of which had been stolen. Decedent was to ride in the stolen car and was to be shot and left in it. The others were to return in Robinson\u2019s car. Robinson was to pay each perpetrator $100 and a quarter of a pound of marijuana. Shortly after midnight, they left as planned, and later returned to report to Robinson that Washington had been killed. They said they had shot him while he was in the back seat of the car and again while he was in the front seat, and had left his body in the front of the car. Burton claimed he was present during the discussion, but did not take any part in the shooting.\nIn defense, appellant attempted to impeach Burton\u2019s credibility by calling Fulton Jones, appellant\u2019s stepbrother, to testify. Jones testified Burton had accused appellant of going with his, Burton\u2019s, girlfriend, and that appellant and Burton had been in a fight. According to Jones, Burton told appellant he would get even with him.\nAppellant alleges he was denied effective assistance of counsel and is thus entitled to a new trial, citing numerous instances of ineffectiveness. However, because of our resolution of one of appellant\u2019s allegations of error, we need reach only one issue. Appellant claims counsel was ineffective for failing to object to one portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. As we stated in Com. ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 604-05, 235 A.2d 349, 352-53 (1967):\n\u201c. . .We cannot emphasize strongly enough, however, that our inquiry ceases and counsel\u2019s assistance is deemed constitutionally effective once we are able to conclude that the particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests. The test is not whether other alternatives were more reasonable, employing a hindsight evaluation of the record. Although weigh the alternatives we must, the balance tips in favor of a finding of effective assistance as soon as it is determined that trial counsel\u2019s decisions had any reasonable basis.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) (Emphasis in original.)\nThus, if any reasonable basis existed for trial counsel\u2019s failure to object, appellant would not be entitled to a new trial. However, if there was no reasonable basis for the failure to object, appellant would have been denied his right to effective assistance of counsel and thus would be entitled to a new trial.\nAs previously mentioned, Elliot Burton had testified the killers informed the gang members that the victim had been shot in both the front and back seats of the car. To bolster Burton\u2019s credibility, the Commonwealth called a police officer, who inspected the vehicle, and who testified that blood stains were present in both the front and back seats. Defense counsel, in his closing remarks, commented:\n\u201cOfficer Cook [the officer in question] was put on the stand by [the assistant district attorney] just to establish an officer at the scene and what he saw. The District Attorney does that for another reason, too. By his question about what was the interior of the car like \u2014 you heard the answer \u2014 he wants to show you it was a bloody scene. Well, you know, sure it was a bloody scene. A young man was killed. There is no question about that. It is a terrible situation.\u201d\nIn response, the prosecutor stated during his closing remarks:\n\u201cThe first officer says, T see blood all over the back of the car; I see blood all over the front of the car.\u2019 I want blood all over the courtroom. I want to upset you about this case. This is nothing but assassination. ... I don\u2019t want to inflame members of the jury. I put it in evidence to corroborate Elliot Burton.\u201d (Emphasis added.)\nAppellant argues his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the emphasized portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. We agree and accordingly grant him a new trial.\nThe American Bar Association Standards Relating to the Prosecution Function, \u00a7 5.8(c) state:\n\u201cThe prosecutor should not use arguments calculated to inflame the passions or prejudices of the jury.\u201d\nIn discussing possible prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments, we have held that this court will follow the A.B.A. Standards. Commonwealth v. Cherry, 474 Pa. 295, 378 A.2d 800 (1977). As we held in Cherry, it is impermissible for a prosecutor to appeal to the emotions of jurors so as to divert their inquiry away from weighing the evidence presented. The prosecutor, by stating, \u201cI want blood all over the courtroom,\u201d did precisely what we condemned in Cherry. Further, when stating in his closing remarks, \u201cI want to upset you about this case,\u201d the prosecutor admitted prosecutorial misconduct. We further believe the prosecutor\u2019s statement that \u201cI don\u2019t want to inflame members of the jury\u201d was ineffective as a possible attempt to mitigate the obvious harm done by his prior statements.\nThe Commonwealth argues the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks were a legitimate response to defense counsel\u2019s arguments during his closing. While defense counsel did state the prosecutor wanted the jury to know it was a bloody scene, that in no way permits the prosecutor to resort to unprofessional conduct during his own closing argument.\nAs we believe a mistrial should have been granted, had defense counsel so moved, we perceive no reasonable basis for failing to object and move for a mistrial. We therefore find that appellant was denied effective assistance of counsel and is entitled to a new trial.\nJudgments of sentence reversed and new trial granted.\nLARSEN, J., joins in the Opinion of the Court and files a separate concurring opinion in which FLAHERTY, J., joins.\nNIX, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nAppellant\u2019s other allegations of error, as set forth in his brief, are:\n\u201c1. Did not the trial Court err when instructing the jury on the issues of accomplice, corrupt source, and credibility.\n\u201c2. Did not trial counsel render ineffective assistance by:\n\u201cA. Failing to object to the trial Court\u2019s instruction on accomplice and corrupt source and also in failing to request a charge on the effect of a prior criminal record on credibility.\n\u201cB. In not objecting to the cross examination of the only defense witness on his non crimin falsi prior convictions.\n* * * * * *\n\u201cD. Failing to interview potential alibi and material witnesses, and by failing to subpoena documentary evidence that would have demonstrated that the Commonwealth witness had lied.\n\u201cE. Failing to request a jury charge on Involuntary Manslaughter.\n\u201cF. Failing to object to hearsay evidence on the identification of the body of the deceased, and thereby not requiring the Commonwealth to prove the identity beyond a reasonable doubt."}
