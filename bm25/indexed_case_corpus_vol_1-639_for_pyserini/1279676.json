{"id": "1279676", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Bell,\nThis appeal involves the interpretation of a holographic will, which often presents a difficult problem. Warren M. Leaver, a widower, died on July 6, 1953. He left a daughter, Marguerite Leaver Macpeak, who has no children, and a son, Carroll Bitter Leaver, who has one child,\nMr. Leaver in his holographic will dated January 30, 1943, provided pertinently as follows:\n\u201cAll articles for domestic purpose or utility, household furniture, and furnishings, books and all articles of private possession (excluding only stocks, bonds and/or documentary evidence of investment) as contained in my home, in my safety deposit box, or elsewhere, I hereby bequeath solely and in their entirety, to my daughter, Marguerite Leaver Macpeak, to be kept or disposed of at her discretion.\n\u201cAny real estate, stocks, bonds, and/or documentary evidence of investment of which I may die possessed. I bequeath to my daughter, Marguerite Leaver Macpeak, and to my son, Carroll Eitter Leaver, in equal shares, and in the following manner:\n\u201cAll real estate shall be sold, at private or public sale at the discretion of my executrix.\n\u201cAll stocks and/or bonds, shall, wherever possible be divided equally, in kind. Any such division developing an odd share, same may be sold and the proceeds equally divided, or if desirable kept by choice, first, of my daughter, Marguerite Leaver Macpeak, or second by my son, Carroll Eitter Leaver by payment therefor, to my Estate, of the appraised value of such odd share as arrived at for Federal Tax purposes.\n\u201cMy Executrix shall have complete discretion as to the sale of any stocks and/or bonds for the purpose of acquiring cash necessary to the settlement of taxes or other proper obligations of my Estate.\u201d\nTestator, in a combination of lay and legal language,\" th\u00e9\u00f1 appointed a Trustee for his son\u2019s \u201cresulting accrual\u201d, and directed that the income from this trust should be paid to his son for his life and after his death to testator\u2019s grandson, Carl Andrew Leaver or his legal issue if living, for a further period of 21 years, and at the end of this period \u201cthe Trust shall be concluded and paid forthwith to my grandson, Carl Andrew Leaver, or his legal surviving issue.\u201d Testator then provided as follows:\n\u201cShould my grandson, Carl Andrew Leaver, predecease my son, Carroll Ritter Leaver, and at such time leave no legal issue, then, upon the death of my son, the Trust shall immediately be concluded and paid forthwith to my daughter, Marguerite Leaver Macpeak, or should she have predeceased my son, then to be paid to Bessie Leaver Nagel, my sister, or her legal heirs.\n\u201cI appoint my daughter, Marguerite Leaver Mac-peak, my sole executrix, to serve without bond.\u201d\nTestator left, inter alia, the following assets:\nU. S. Postage Stamps (at Inventory valuation) $2,438.30\nHousehold Furniture (at Inventory valuation) 934.50\nU. S. Coins (at Inventory valuation) 100.26\nJewelry (at Inventory valuation) 2,319.50\nHamilton Watch (at Inventory valuation) 3.50\nCash \u2014 in safe deposit box 15,000.00\nCash \u2014 National Bank of Boyertown 42,688.16\nCash- \u2014 Florida National Bank 3,674.29\nCash \u2014 due from Boyertown Burial Casket\nCo. 10,285.02\nCash on person 25.71\n$77,469.24\nTestator also left securities \u2014 composed of stocks, bonds, mineral deeds and installment shares of a Savings and Loan Association \u2014 which had an appraised value of $379,768.\nThe parties were satisfied with President Judge Marx's able adjudication (in which he disposed of a number of difficult questions) with two exceptions. He awarded to Mrs. Macpeak, under the paragraph of testator\u2019s will beginning with \u201cAll articles for domestic purpose. . .\u201d, household furniture having an inventory-value of $934.50, and jewelry having an inventory value of $2,319.50. Mrs. Macpeak claims that she was entitled, in addition to this property, to the United States Postage Stamps, the United States Coins, the Hamilton watch, cash in safe deposit box, cash in National Bank of Boyertown, cash in Florida National Bank, cash on person and cash due from the Boyertown Burial Casket Company. The articles or property she claims total $77,469.24.\nThe Court below and each party in this appeal rely on Beisgen Estate, 387 Pa. 425, 128 A. 2d 52. In that case, quoting from Cannistra Estate, 384 Pa. 605, 607, 121 A. 2d 157, the Court said (page 432) : \u201c. . . \u2018 \u201cThe testator\u2019s intention must be ascertained from the language and scheme of his will: \u2018it is not what the Court thinks he might or would have said in the existing circumstances, or even what the Court thinks he meant to say, but what is the meaning of his words\u2019: Britt Estate, 369 Pa. [450, 454, 87 A. 2d 243]\u201d: Sowers Estate, 383 Pa. 566, 119 A. 2d 60.\u2019 \u201d\nHowever, in that case the factual situation, namely the language of the will, was very different from the language of this will. There the testatrix gave to her daughter \u201call my personal effects including clothing and household goods\u201d. There was no residuary clause. This Court held that the words \u201cpersonal effects\u201d as used in conjunction with \u201cclothing and household goods\u201d and with no residuary clause, were limited to personal effects and did not include cash or stock.\nMr. Leaver did not merely leave Ms daughter \u201cAll . . . household furniture, and furnishings, books and all articles of private possession ... as contained in my home, in my safety deposit box, or elsewhere\u201d, he went further and specified and defined what he meant by \u201carticles of private possession\u201d when he added thereto \u201c(excluding only stocks, bonds and/or documentary evidence of investment)\u201d. The will leaves no doubt that Leaver intended to give his daughter more than his son, although how much more is of course the debatable question. We believe that he intended Ms gift of \u201cany real estate, stocks, bonds and/or documentary evidence of investment of which I may die possessed\u201d \u201cin equal shares\u201d to his daughter and his son, to be a residuary clause, and to cover and include everything which he had not theretofore willed his daughter. Furthermore any other interpretation would result in an intestacy if cash was never disposed of by the will; there is not only a presumption against intestacy but it is clear from the testator\u2019s will that he intended to dispose of all his property.\nConstruing the will as a whole, we believe the testator intended to give his daughter all his personal property whether contained in his home or in his safety deposit box or elsewhere excepting and excluding only stocks, bonds and documentary evidence of investment; and to give equally to his daughter and his son (and his son\u2019s child and issue) his stocks, bonds and documentary evidence of investment, as well as his real estate. We are, therefore, of the opinion that Mrs. Mac-peak was entitled under her father\u2019s will to the household furniture and furnishings, the jewelry, the United States Postage Stamps, the United States Coins, the Hamilton watch, and the cash of which he died possessed, namely, the cash on his person and the cash in his safe deposit box and the cash in the National Bank of Boyertown and the cash in the Florida National Bank, but not to the sum of $9,237.26 representing the amount due the decedent from Boyertown Burial Casket Company under a peculiar building-sale-occupancy written agreement dated November 18, 1947.\nMrs. Macpeak also contends that the discretion given her in the will to sell \u201cany stocks and/or bonds for the purpose of acquiring cash necessary to the settlement of taxes or other proper obligations of my Estate\u201d showed a clear direction and intention to have all Federal Estate Taxes paid out of the stocks and bonds without any apportionment as required by the Estate Tax Apportionment Act of 1951, P. L. 1405, \u00a72, 20 PS \u00a7882.\nThe Federal Estate Tax is to be equitably apportioned among all persons who receive the property of the testator unless the testator clearly directs, either expressly or by necessary implication, a contrary intention: Harvey Estate, 350 Pa. 53, 38 A. 2d 262; Edwards Estate, 377 Pa. 606, 105 A. 2d 312. We agree with the learned Auditing Judge that a consideration of the above quoted provision of the will, as well as of the entire will, does not show any intention to have all Federal Estate Taxes paid out of the stocks and bonds, without any apportionment.\nThe Decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, as thus modified, is affirmed. Costs shall be paid by Marguerite Leaver Macpeak.\nTestator owned an undivided interest in several pieces of mineral land at the time he made-his will and at his death.\nUnder a very unusual Written agreement'.\nErroneously shown in the Amended Proposed Distribution to the Executor\u2019s Account as \u201cCash due from Boyertown Burial Casket Co. $10,285.02.\u201d\nExcluding charitable gifts which have no pertinence in this case."}
