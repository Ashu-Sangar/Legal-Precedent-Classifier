{"id": "1765656", "contents": "OPINION\nLARSEN, Justice.\n. Clement Turner, appellee, was arrested and charged with criminal homicide in the death of Irwin Liggins, Jr., age 21 months. A non-jury trial was held before the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County. At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief, the trial judge sustained appellee\u2019s demurrer to the evidence and discharged the appelleedefendant. The Commonwealth then appealed to this Court.\nThe test to be applied in ruling on a demurrer is whether, accepting as true all of the prosecution\u2019s evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom, it is sufficient to support a finding by the fact-finder that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Commonwealth v. Duncan, 473 Pa. 62, 65 n.2, 373 A.2d 1051, 1052 n.2 (1977). Applying that standard, the following facts appear of record.\nBarbara Ann Miklos and the infant son, Irwin, were visiting appellee, Ms. Miklos\u2019 boyfriend, at his home in Pittsburgh. Early in the afternoon of June 10, 1979, the child began to misbehave by throwing some food. Appellee hit the child with his hand three or four times on the buttocks. When the child continued to misbehave, appellee escalated his discipline.\nLater that afternoon, appellee beat the child about the legs and back with a belt which had a heavy buckle and a zipper pouch. Later still, after the boy spit some food on the floor, appellee again beat the child several times with the belt, finally stopping at Ms. Miklos\u2019 insistence. After the child had placed his fingers near an electric fan, appellee beat him three or four times with his shoe, and apparently feeling this discipline insufficient to modify the young child\u2019s behavior, appellee continued to beat him with a one-inch thick wooden stick against his buttocks, legs and bare back. These multiple beatings raised numerous welts and bruises upon the child\u2019s legs, buttocks, chest and back.\nMs. Miklos decided to return to her own home that night, and together with her son and appellee, walked to the bus stop. However, as she had missed the last bus, she returned with appellee to spend the night at his apartment. Ms. Miklos placed the boy on the couch which was approximately 15 inches from the floor to the cushion, in appellee\u2019s bedroom then went to bed at approximately 1:30 a. m. At that time, Ms. Miklos noticed no injuries or marks on Irwin\u2019s head or face.\nAt about 3:45 a. m., Barbara Miklos was awakened by appellee\u2019s shouts that Irwin was not breathing. The child was lying on his back beside the couch. Ms. Miklos then noticed bruises on his head. Neither paramedics nor hospital personnel could revive the child and he was pronounced dead at 4:12 a. m.\nDeath was attributed to cerebral edema, or a swelling of the brain. This was caused by neurogenic shock which resulted from blunt force injuries sustained by the victim. The autopsy revealed numerous injuries to the chest, buttocks, back, and legs, and at least fifteen separate areas of contusions about the head of the child. Both the coroner, Dr. Steven Goldblatt and the chief forensic pathologist, Dr. Joshua Perper, testified that the child\u2019s death was due to the combination of the trunk and head injuries.\nPursuant to defense stipulation, evidence was received that blood stains found on the bedspread covering the couch cushions near where the child\u2019s head lay as he slept, and a towel also found on the couch, were consistent with the blood of the victim. No blood stains were found elsewhere in the apartment.\nAppellee demurred to the above evidence. The lower court granted the demurrer. The reasoning was two-fold: first, the court noted no direct evidence had been introduced to show that appellee struck the victim in the head, and found the circumstantial evidence was as consistent with self-inflicted, accidental injury as it was with homicide. Second, the court found that the below-head injuries were not shown to have been, of themselves, the cause of death and therefore, in the absence of direct proof of above-head beatings by appellee, ruled that the requisite causation element had not been established beyond a reasonable doubt. We find the lower court\u2019s reasoning faulty.\nWe are unable to comprehend, after examining the record how the lower court could conclude that the inferences arising from the evidence were as consistent with self-inflicted, accidental head injuries as they were with homicide. The reasonable inferences arising from the evidence overwhelmingly negate the possibility of accidental head injuries.\nWhile Dr. Goldblatt acknowledged the remote possibility that a contusion to the child\u2019s head could have been caused by a fall, he discounted that possibility. The following exchange took, place between the defense counsel (on cross-examination) and Dr. Goldblatt:\nQ When you use the term blunt force injury, does that necessarily mean that one person striking another with an object or with their hand or something like that?\nA No. One could get a blunt force injury from a fall.\nQ You could fall and get a contusion?\nA Striking something.\nQ Are you able to state with some medical certainty the manner of blunt force injury which caused the injury to the head?\nA Whether an object struck the head or whether the head struck an object?\nQ Right.\nA With a reasonable probability by the number and location of the blow, the only way it could happen, it\u2019s mostly something striking the head. If it were to occur from the head striking the object, it would have to be on multiple occasions, repeated by at least from the location of the injury. There would have to have \u2014the head would have to strike something else probably at least ten different times, (emphasis added)\nNotes of Testimony at 121-122.\nIn spite of this testimony, the trial court concluded \u201cit is just as logical ... to believe that the child could have fallen off the couch and sustained the injuries to his head .... Likewise, it is just as logical to argue that this child could have gotten down off that couch, wandered around in this darkened, cluttered room and fallen over something, injuring his head.\u201d These possibilities are fantasy \u2014 did the child fall off the 15 inch-high couch 10 times? Did he stumble and fall 10 times? Of course not. This Court has never required the Commonwealth to disprove every possibility of accidental death or to prove that a hypothetical event did not take place. Commonwealth v. Green, 477 Pa. 170, 175, 383 A.2d 877, 879 (1978). In light of appellee\u2019s earlier vicious beatings of the child, and in light of the extreme unlikelihood of accidental head injuries under the circumstances presented, the evidence, and reasonable inferences therefrom, were clearly sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant delivered the blows to the child\u2019s head.\nA very similar situation confronted this Court in Commonwealth v. Paquette, 451 Pa. 250, 301 A.2d 837 (1973). In Paquette, this Court stated:\nAdmittedly, there were no eyewitnesses to the alleged beating; but the Commonwealth need not prove its case directly. Circumstantial evidence can be as reliable and persuasive as eyewitness testimony. Commonwealth v. New, 354 Pa. 188, 47 A.2d 450 (1946); See I Wigmore \u00a7 26 (3d Ed. 1940).\n[T]he medical evidence, offered by the Commonwealth, clearly establishes repeated and severe blows to the infant as being the origin of the factors causing death. Such a finding is completely incompatible with the defense\u2019s theory that the injuries were either sustained by a fall from the couch to the floor or an epileptic fit while the child was in the bath. Considering the number of bruises, their severity and their positioning about the head and the face, the factfinder was justified in rejecting the possibility of accidental or self-inflicted injury particularly when recognizing the mobility of a 6V2 month old baby.\nWhere, as here, an adult has sole custody of a child for a period of time, and, during that time the child suffers wounds which unquestionably are neither self-inflicted nor accidental, the evidence is sufficient to allow a jury to infer that the adult inflicted the wounds, (citations omitted) Id., 451 Pa. at 255, 301 A.2d at 839.\nIn the instant case, the prosecution\u2019s evidence demonstrated that Barbara Miklos went to sleep at 1:30 a. m., at which time Irwin\u2019s head was unbruised, and awoke to appellee\u2019s screams at 3:45 a. m., at which time the child\u2019s head had sustained severe injury. Thus, the sole custody inference is applicable to appellee. Here, as in Paquette, the evidence is sufficient to allow an inference that appellee inflicted the head wounds. See also, Commonwealth v. Blevins, 453 Pa. 481, 309 A.2d 421 (1973). Since the combination of head and body injuries caused the death of the child, and since evidence offered proved appellee responsible for all injuries, the lower court erred in granting the demurrer. Accordingly, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County is reversed, and the case is remanded for a new trial.\nROBERTS, J., concurred in the result.\n. The trial court distinguished Paquette on the basis that Irwin, a 21 month old child, was much more mobile than the 6V2 month old victim in Paquette and, thus, the likelihood of self-inflicted accidental injury was much greater in this case. We find this distinction insignificant in view of the number and severity of the blows to Irwin\u2019s head, as well as the fact that, according to Dr. Goldblatt, the injuries to the body alone would have initiated the shock, which shock would have decreased Irwin\u2019s mobility.\n. As we find the evidence sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that appellee caused the injuries to both the child\u2019s head and his body, there is no need to address Judge Lewis\u2019 causation analysis in detail. However, it appears this reasoning was also erroneous. Even though the lower court\u2019s opinion points out that \u201cboth doctors testified that it was the combination of all the injuries that caused the child to go into shock and eventually die\u201d, the proof of causation was insufficient because the doctors could not say \u201cwith medical certainty that the blows to the body alone ... were a substantial factor in bringing about the victim\u2019s death.\u201d We think this is an inaccurate reading of the doctors\u2019 testimony. While purporting to view the medical testimony \u201cas a whole\u201d, the lower court appeared, instead, to focus on one instance where Dr. Goldblatt testified he didn\u2019t know how to qualify the word \u201csubstantial\u201d. (\u201cThe action of defendant must constitute a direct and substantial factor in causing the death of the victim .... Commonwealth v. Johnson, 445 Pa. 276, 284 A.2d 734 (1971)). However, the record as a whole reads loud and clear that both the above-neck and below-neck injuries\u2014 the combination of blows as the lower court itself noted \u2014 were the cause of death. Thus, even if there was no proof linking appellee to the head injuries, the medical testimony was sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the injuries struck by appellee to the child\u2019s legs, back, chest and buttocks were a \u201cdirect and substantial cause of death.\u201d"}
