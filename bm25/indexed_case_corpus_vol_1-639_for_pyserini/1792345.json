{"id": "1792345", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Chief Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court affirming a final order of the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) which certified the Pennsylvania Social Services Union (\u201cUnion\u201d) as the exclusive representative of a collective bargaining unit of Lehigh County (\u201cCounty\u201d) court-appointed employees for purposes of the Public Employe Relations Act (\u201cPERA\u201d), Act of July 23, 1970, P.L. 563, No. 195, as amended, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101.101 et seq. (Supp.1984-85). 76 Pa.Cmwlth. 641, 464 A.2d 699. Pursuant to the Board\u2019s order the personal secretaries to the judges of the Lehigh County Court of Common Pleas were included in the bargaining unit. The sole issue to be resolved in this appeal is whether such judicial secretaries are \u201cconfidential employes\u201d under section 301 of PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301 and thereby ineligible for membership in a public employee collective bargaining unit.\nI.\nThe proceedings in this case commenced when the Union filed a petition for representation with the Board on October 10,1978. The Board conducted hearings on the petition during which the Honorable Martin J. Coyne, President Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County, testified extensively regarding the various job classifications under consideration for inclusion in the employee unit. The Union and the County were prepared to stipulate that the judges\u2019 personal secretaries were confidential employees but presented Judge Coyne\u2019s testimony on that issue at the request of the Board. After the hearings the Board directed that an election be held among the court-appointed employees including the judicial secretaries. The employees cast sixty (60) votes in favor of the Union and forty-one (41) for no representation. Seven (7) ballots were challenged and never opened. With a majority of the unit voting in favor of the Union, the Board certified it as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of the County\u2019s court-appointed professional and non-professional employees. Judicial secretaries were included in that employee unit.\nThe County filed exceptions to the Board\u2019s certification order, complaining in part that the Board had improperly concluded that the judicial secretaries were not \u201cconfidential employes.\u201d The Board rejected that contention and issued a final order of certification. The County then filed a petition for review in the Court of Common Pleas. Upon application by the Union this Court transferred the matter to the Commonwealth Court, which affirmed the Board. We granted the County\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal and, by order dated January 25, 1984, limited the appeal to the issue of whether judicial secretaries are \u201cconfidential employes\u201d under PERA.\nII.\nBy enacting PERA the legislature, in an effort to promote orderly and constructive relationships between public employers and their employees, authorized public employees to organize and required public employers to recognize and bargain with the employees\u2019 representatives. This Court has upheld the constitutionality of PERA as applied to court-appointed employees. Commonwealth ex rel. Bradley v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, 479 Pa. 440, 388 A.2d 736 (1978).\nThe right to organize and bargain collectively conferred upon employees in the public sector by PERA is limited, however, by PERA\u2019s definition of \u201cpublic employe.\u201d \u201cConfidential employes\u201d are specifically excluded from that definition. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301(2). \u201cConfidential employe\u201d is defined as \u201cany employe who works: (i) in the personnel offices of a public employer and has access to information subject to use by the public employer in collective bargaining; or (ii) in a close continuing relationship with public officers or representatives associated with collective bargaining on behalf of the employer.\u201d 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301(13). Since \u201cconfidential employes\u201d are not \u201cpublic employes\u201d for purposes of PERA, they may not be included in a collective bargaining unit.\nThe policy underlying this exclusion of \u201cconfidential employes\u201d is the \u201crecognition of the need to balance the right of employes to be represented with the right of the employer to formulate its labor policies with the assistance of employes not represented by the union with which it deals.\u201d Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. Altoona Area School District, 480 Pa. 148, 153, 389 A.2d 553, 556 (1978). It is therefore appropriate to give the statutory definition a narrow interpretation. The test of \u201cconfidential employe\u201d status under the second prong of the definition, which was developed by the Board and has been adopted by this Court is \u201cwhether or not the employee acts in a confidential capacity to a person who formulates, determines or affectuates management policies in the field of labor relations.\u201d Id., 480 Pa. at 154, 389 A.2d at 556, quoting B.F Goodrich Co., 115 NLRB No. 103, 37 LRRM 1383, 1384 (1956).\nThe County maintains that judicial secretaries fall within this second category of \u201cconfidential employes.\u201d Since the Board concedes, as it must, that personal judicial secretaries have a \u201cclose continuing relationship\u201d with their respective judges, our decision turns on whether those judges formulate, determine or effectuate managerial labor policies.\nIII.\nThe power to appoint necessary personnel is inherent in the judicial power. Sweet v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board (Sweet I), 457 Pa. 456, 322 A.2d 362 (1974); see also 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2301. The authority to supervise and to discharge court-appointed employees is not only a necessary corollary to this appointment power but also is essential to the maintenance of an independent judiciary. See Commonwealth ex rel. Bradley v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, supra; Ellenbogen v. County of Allegheny, 479 Pa. 429, 388 A.2d 730 (1978). Since the court has the inherent right to hire, discharge and supervise, an employer-employee relationship exists by definition between the judges and their appointees. Commonwealth ex rel. Bradley v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, supra; Sweet I, supra; see Costigan v. Philadelphia Finance Department Employees Local 696, AFSCME, 462 Pa. 425, 341 A.2d 456 (1975). The fact that those employees are paid by the county does not alter the court\u2019s employer status. Sweet I, supra. We have held, in addition, that the judges of a court of common pleas are in fact \u201cpublic employers\u201d for purposes of PERA. Commonwealth ex rel. Bradley v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, supra.\nAs public employers, judges must formulate and effectuate policies governing the employment relationship. Indeed, such policies are crucial to the efficient administration of justice. Unlike many public employers, however, judges no longer participate directly in collective bargaining negotiations with their employees. The legislature, recognizing that judges are too scarce and too essential to the administration of justice to be required to perform the non-adjudicatory function of managerial representation of the bargaining table, Ellenbogen v. County of Allegheny, supra, amended the County Code in 1976 to provide that judges are to be represented in negotiations as well as representation proceedings by the board of county commissioners. Act of August 9, 1955, P.L. 323, \u00a7 1620, as amended, 16 P.S. \u00a7 1620 (Supp. 1984-85). Section 1620 now provides:\nThe salaries and compensation of county officers shall be as now or hereafter fixed by law. The salaries and compensation of all appointed officers and employes who are paid from the county treasury shall be fixed by the salary board created by this act for such purposes: Provided, however, That with respect to representation proceedings before the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board or collective bargaining negotiations involving any or all employes paid from the county treasury, the board of county commissioners shall have the sole power and responsibility to represent judges of the court of common pleas, the county and all elected or appointed county officers having any employment powers over the affected employes. The exercise of such responsibilities by the county commissioners shall in no way affect the hiring, discharging and supervising rights and obligations with respect to such employes as may be vested in the judges or other county officers.\n16 P.S. \u00a7 1620 (Supp.1984-85) (Emphasis added).\nThe Board argues that, because the judges do not represent themselves at the bargaining table, they are not \u201cassociated with collective bargaining\u201d and consequently their personal secretaries are not \u201cconfidential employes\u201d under section 301(13) of PERA, 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.301(13). In support of this contention the Board maintains that the county commissioners do not represent judges, contrary to the clear language of section 1620 of the County Code, but solely themselves. The county commissioners, in the Board\u2019s view, are empowered to negotiate only matters within their control, namely financial terms, over which the judges have no authority. The Board interprets section 1620 and our cases interpreting it as establishing that bargaining over any other terms of employment is impermissible. Thus there is no occasion for communication between the commissioners and the judges regarding negotiations and no detriment to management in permitting the inclusion of the judges\u2019 personal secretaries in the bargaining unit.\nThe Board misconstrues the statutory scheme. The legislative amendment neither affects the judges\u2019 managerial function nor limits the scope of collective bargaining by court-appointed employees. Section 1620 explicitly states that the county commissioners are to \u201crepresent the judges of the court of common pleas\u201d in negotiations. We have interpreted that phrase to mean \u201csit on behalf of judges.\u201d Ellenbogen v. County of Allegheny, supra, 479 Pa. at 437, 388 A.2d at 734. The judges are principals in the negotiations participating through the county commissioners. Thus the county commissioners are clearly charged with the responsibility of representing the judges \u2019 managerial interests, as well as their own, in contract negotiations with court-appointed employees.\nMoreover, contrary to the Board\u2019s arguments, section 1620\u2019s proviso that \u201c[t]he exercise of such responsibilities by the county commissioners shall in no way affect the hiring, discharging and supervising rights and obligations with respect to such employes as may be vested in the judges or other county officers\u201d does not limit the permissible subject of bargaining to purely financial terms. The proviso merely recognizes that, under PERA, matters affecting the hiring, discharge and supervisory powers of the public employer are not subjects of collective bargaining. See 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.702 (selection and direction of personnel not subject to collective bargaining); 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.706 (employer\u2019s right to discharge for cause not impaired). Rather, under the express language of section 701 of PERA, court-appointed employees\u2019 \u201cwages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment\u201d are subjects of mandatory bargaining. 43 P.S. \u00a7 1101.701 (emphasis added). In Commonwealth ex rel. Bradley v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, supra, we rejected the argument of the judges of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas that \u201csubjecting \u2018wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment\u2019 ... to bargaining [would] interfere with their ability to administer justice.\u201d Id., 479 Pa. at 447, 388 A.2d at 739. Relying on our decision in Ellenbogen v. County of Allegheny, supra, in which we held that so long as judges retain their authority to select, discharge and supervise court personnel, the independence of the judiciary is unimpaired, we upheld the applicability of PERA to courts of common pleas and their appointees. We further noted that the judiciary has the inherent power to prevent any actual impairment of its independence created by the collective bargaining process. Commonwealth ex rel. Bradley v. Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board, supra 479 Pa. at 447, 388 A.2d at 739-40; see also Ellenbogen v. County of Allegheny, supra. Thus under our decisions county commissioners are not prohibited from negotiating \u201cwages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment\u201d provided such terms do not impinge upon judicial control of hiring, discharge and supervision in some concrete manner.\nMoreover, although, as we indicated in Ellenbogen v. County of Allegheny, supra 479 Pa. at 438, 388 A.2d at 735, \u201cmost of those matters properly within the scope of mandatory bargaining, see Act 195, \u00a7\u00a7 701 and 702, 43 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1101.701 and 1101.702; Pennsylvania Labor Relations Board v. State College Area School District, 461 Pa. 494, 337 A.2d 262 (1975), concern wages and other financial terms of employment,\u201d the county commissioners\u2019 legitimate fiscal concerns are not the only interests involved on the management side of negotiations with court employees. Judges retain a vital managerial interest in terms such as hours, vacations and other paid leave which could be considered primarily \u201cfinancial.\u201d While the county commissioners are in an ideal position to assess the impact of the total cost of a collective bargaining agreement on the county treasury, they have no expertise in the area of judicial administration. Without input from the judges they would be forced to negotiate in a vacuum. The organization of the court, its workload and the availability of staff must be taken into consideration as well as the bottom line. Thus the managerial policies formulated by the judges must remain an integral element of the county commissioners\u2019 bargaining position.\nFor example, a shorter work day, increased vacation time or additional paid holidays might be considered in return for a smaller wage increase. Such a compromise may be acceptable to the county commissioners and the union. However, the decrease in total work hours might adversely affect the administration of justice. The county commissioners must consult with the judges in order to ascertain the effect such a proposal may have upon the court if the resulting collective bargaining agreement is to pass constitutional muster. If it is determined that there would be no adverse impact there is no reason why the proposal should not be embodied in the collective bargaining agreement. It would be contrary to the public interest to bar such terms on the ground that they may impair the judges\u2019 \u201csupervisory\u201d authority in the abstract when the simple solution of prior consultation with the judges themselves is available. In any event, contractual terms which actually impair the independence must be declared void and agreements countenancing such terms would totally defeat the purposes of PERA.\nIf the rights given to county court employees under PERA are to have any efficacy, those employees must be permitted to bargain with the county commissioners concerning all of PERA\u2019s permissible subjects of collective bargaining. Concomitantly, to promote and maintain the efficient administration of justice and the enforceability of their employees\u2019 contracts, the judges of the courts of common pleas must have input through the county commissioners. Communication between the judges and the commissioners is essential and the access of the judges\u2019 personal secretaries to such crucial information is inevitable. Thus judicial secretaries must be deemed \u201cconfidential employes\u201d for purposes of PERA and may not be included in any bargaining unit consisting of court-appointed employees.\nAccordingly, the order of the Commonwealth Court affirming the Board\u2019s inclusion of judicial secretaries in the court-appointed employees\u2019 bargaining unit is reversed and the Board\u2019s order is to that extent vacated.\nLARSEN, J., files a concurring opinion.\nZAPPALA, J., files a dissenting opinion.\n. This Court is vested with jurisdiction pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 724(a)."}
