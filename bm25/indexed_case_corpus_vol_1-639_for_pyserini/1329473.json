{"id": "1329473", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice NIGRO.\nThis appeal raises the issue of whether the Commonwealth Court erred in granting a license for the operation of a halfway house for recovering alcoholics and drug-addicts in a residential zoning district based on its conclusion that the facility qualified as a \u201csingle-family detached dwelling\u201d under the local zoning ordinance. For the following reasons, we conclude that it did err and therefore reverse.\nOn January 13, 2000, Dawn Albert filed a zoning application to operate a halfway house, known as The Waverly Retreat (the \u201cRetreat\u201d), on a 30-acre tract of land that she and her siblings own in North Abington Township (the \u201cTownship\u201d). The Township\u2019s zoning officer denied her application, concluding that the proposed use is not a permitted use in the R-l Low Density Residential District (the \u201cR-1 District\u201d) in which the property is located.\nAlbert appealed to the Township\u2019s Zoning Hearing Board (\u201cZHB\u201d), and the ZHB held a public hearing on March 14, 2000. As the ZHB stated in its findings of fact, Albert testified at the hearing that \u201cher goal was to establish ... a sober, family-type residential environment for females ... who had completed in-patient rehabilitation programs [for drug or alcohol abuse at other facilities].\u201d ZHB Op. at 3; R.R. at 60a. Albert testified that she intended to accommodate between six and fifteen women at the Retreat and that there would be no limit on the length of a resident\u2019s stay, provided that the resident followed the Retreat\u2019s rules. R.R. at 67a; ZHB Op. at 5. That said, Albert also presented evidence that the average stay for a resident at the facility would be between two and six months. R.R. at 49a, 92a.\nAccording to Albert, the Retreat would not offer \u201ctreatment,\u201d but would employ a supervisor or \u201chousemother,\u201d who would \u201cact as a head of the household in much the same way as a parent does in a family with children.\u201d R.R. at 64a-65a; ZHB Op. at 4. The housemother would \u201chelp plan and arrange for the activities of the group,\u201d would resolve disputes among the residents, and would enforce the rules of the Retreat. R.R. at 65a; ZHB Op. at 4. Albert testified that the housemother would also be responsible for meal planning, which would be served \u201cfamily style\u201d and would be \u201cprepared by members of the group on a rotating basis.\u201d R.R. at 65a; ZHB Op. at 4-5. Together the residents would maintain the common areas of the residence, but each would be \u201cresponsible to maintain her own personal living space.\u201d R.R. at 65a; ZHB Op. at 5. A \u201csubstantial part of each day\u2019s activities\u201d would be \u201cdevoted to addressing and solving common problems in addiction,\u201d and the residents would \u201cmeet frequently in small groups to discuss their common experiences.\u201d R.R. at 61-62; ZHB Op. at 5. Albert testified that the residents would pay approximately $100 a day for residential services, but that the project was \u201cnot proposed as a profit-making enterprise.\u201d R.R. at 69a-70a; ZHB Op. at 12, 20. According to the ZHB, Albert \u201cindicated that if the revenues derived from the payments by residents exceeded the expenses of the residents, she was prepared to make an appropriate pledge to a recreation or education program for the youth of the township.\u201d ZHB Op. at 20; see also R.R. at 70a. Nevertheless, the only evidence presented at the hearing regarding the Retreat\u2019s expected expenses was a lease showing that the Retreat would lease the property from the owners (Albert and her siblings) for $4,000 per month. See ZHB Op. at 3.\nBased on the evidence adduced at the hearing, the ZHB reversed the decision of the zoning officer, concluding that the proposed use of the property was permitted under the local zoning ordinance because the Retreat qualified as a \u201csingle-family detached dwelling,\u201d a permissible use in the R-l District. See North Abington Township Zoning Ordinance (the \u201cOrdinance\u201d), R.R. 419a. Accordingly, the ZHB approved the zoning permit, subject to a number of conditions, including that Albert operate the Retreat through a non-profit corporation. See ZHB Op. at 15; Trial Ct. Op. at 3.\nOn appeal, the trial court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Specifically, the trial court affirmed the granting of the application to operate the Retreat as a permitted use in the R-l District based on its status as a \u201csingle-family detached dwelling,\u201d but struck down all of the conditions except the requirement that the facility operate through a non-profit corporation. Subsequently, the Commonwealth Court affirmed on the basis of the trial court opinion. See North Abington Twp. v. Albert, 787 A.2d 1135 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001) (Table). Appellants Ernest J. and Hollis D\u2019Agata, William D. and Mary Carroll Donahoe, and Dr. Charles and Judith Curtin, all of whom are residents of a Township Development known as Grouse Hill, where the Retreat is to be located, sought allowance of appeal, contending that the Commonwealth Court should not have affirmed the grant of the permit application. We granted their Petition, Albert v. Zoning Hearing Bd. of North Abington Twp., 570 Pa. 700, 809 A.2d 905 (2002) (Table), and now reverse.\nThe crux of Appellants\u2019 argument to this Court is that the Commonwealth Court erred by applying an over-inclusive definition of \u201cfamily\u201d in concluding that the Retreat qualifies as a \u201csingle-family detached dwelling\u201d under the Ordinance. We agree.\nUnder the Ordinance, the principal permitted uses in the R-l District are single-family detached dwellings; churches and parish houses; public parks and playgrounds; and agriculture. Ordinance \u00a7 3.111, R.R. 419a. A single-family dwelling is defined under the Ordinance as \u201ca detached building, designated for or occupied exclusively by one family and containing not more than one dwelling unit.\u201d Ordinance \u00a7 11.122a (emphasis added), R.R. at 503a. Meanwhile, the Ordinance defines \u201cdwelling unit\u201d as \u201c[o]ne (1) or more rooms, including a kitchen or kitchenette, and sanitary facilities in a dwelling structure, designed as a unit for occupancy by not more than one (1) family for living and sleeping purposes.\u201d Ordinance \u00a7 11.124 (emphasis added), R.R. at 504a. In light of these definitions, the parties and the lower tribunals agree that whether or not the Retreat qualifies as a \u201csingle-family detached dwelling\u201d ultimately turns on the meaning of \u201cfamily,\u201d which the Ordinance does not define. That is, only if the residents of the Retreat are a \u201cfamily\u201d for purposes of the Ordinance can the Retreat qualify as a \u201csingle-family detached dwelling\u201d and thereby obtain a permit to operate in the R-l District.\nIn addressing the proper interpretation of \u201cfamily\u201d as used in the Ordinance, the ZHB initially noted that \u201ca permitted use must be afforded the broadest interpretation so that land owners may have the benefit of the least restrictive use in enjoyment of their land.\u201d ZHB Op. at 7 (quoting Human Consultants Services, Inc. v. Butler Twp., 137 Pa.Cmwlth. 594, 587 A.2d 40, 42 (1991)). With that standard in mind, it briefly canvassed cases in this Commonwealth which have addressed the meaning of \u201cfamily\u201d in zoning ordinances. The ZHB began with this Court\u2019s decision in Appeal of Miller, 511 Pa. 631, 515 A.2d 904 (1986), which it cited as establishing the proposition that \u201ca group of persons need not be related by blood or marriage to constitute a family.\u201d ZHB Op. at 7. It then cited to a series of Commonwealth Court decisions holding that (1) a zoning ordinance defining family to exclude foster children was unconstitutional, because a foster family is the functional equivalent of a biologically-related family, see id. at 7-8 (citing to Children\u2019s Home v. City of Easton, 53 Pa.Cmwlth. 216, 417 A.2d 830, 832 (1980)), (2) a husband and wife housing three mentally retarded children pursuant to a Department of Public Welfare program constituted a family, see id. at 8 (citing to Hopkins v. Zoning Hearing Bd. of Abington Twp., 55 Pa.Cmwlth. 365, 423 A.2d 1082 (1980)), (3) four unrelated adult mentally retarded women and a ten-person support staff constituted a family, see id. at 8-9 (citing to JALC Real Estate Corp. v. Zoning Hearing Bd. of Lower Salford Twp., 104 Pa.Cmwlth. 605, 522 A.2d 710 (1987)), and (4) three mentally retarded residents in a supervised, residential home atmosphere with one resident staff member constituted a family. See id. at 8 (citing to Philadelphia Center v. Zoning Hearing Bd. of Plymouth Twp., 89 Pa.Cmwlth. 591, 492 A.2d 1191, 1193 (1985)). The ZHB then concluded that \u201cthe residents of the ... proposed Waverly Retreat would in fact meet the definition of a \u2018family\u2019 under the various case law decisions in cases with similar factual settings and similar ordinances.\u201d ZHB Op. at 14. On appeal, the trial court affirmed, incorporating into its opinion large portions of the ZHB\u2019s opinion. See Trial Ct. Op. at 7-10. The Commonwealth Court also affirmed, stating that the issues were \u201cthoroughly and correctly analyzed in the comprehensive and well-reasoned opinion of the trial court.\u201d Commw. Ct. Op. at 8.\nAppellants now contend that all three of the lower tribunals erred in failing to credit their two primary arguments as to why the residents of the Retreat could not be deemed a \u201cfamily,\u201d namely, that both Albert\u2019s \u201cclear profit motive\u201d and the short-term stays of the Retreat residents are not qualities consistent with a traditional \u201cfamily.\u201d Appellants\u2019 Brf. at 13. In considering these arguments, this Court must determine whether the ZHB committed an error of law or a manifest abuse of discretion. See C & M Developers, Inc. v. Bedminster Twp. Zoning Hearing Bd., 573 Pa. 2, 820 A.2d 143, 150 (2002) (articulating standard of review where trial court has taken no additional evidence); Patricca v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 527 Pa. 267, 590 A.2d 744, 746 (1991) (same). An abuse of discretion will be found only where the ZHB\u2019s findings are not supported by substantial evidence. See Hertzberg v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 554 Pa. 249, 721 A.2d 43 (1998). Moreover, in conducting our review, we must keep in mind that zoning ordinances are to be liberally construed and interpreted broadly to permit a landowner the broadest possible use of her land. 53 P.S. \u00a7 10603.1; Southco, Inc. v. Concord Twp., 552 Pa. 66, 713 A.2d 607, 609 (1998).\nThis Court addressed the meaning of \u201cfamily\u201d in the context of a zoning ordinance in Appeal of Miller, 511 Pa. 631, 515 A.2d 904 (1986). In that case, Irene C. Miller, a homeowner in a zoning district permitting single-family dwellings, took into her house seven boarders, all of whom were either elderly or handicapped and none of whom were related to her by blood or marriage. When the township zoning officer ordered Miller to cease such use of the property, declaring that it was not a permitted \u201csingle-family\u201d use, Miller appealed to the township\u2019s Zoning Board of Adjustment (the \u201cBoard\u201d). However, the Board agreed with the zoning officer that the residents of the home did not constitute a \u201cfamily\u201d under the terms of the relevant township ordinance, which defined \u201cfamily\u201d as \u201cany number of persons living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit.\u201d Specifically, the Board reasoned that the residents were not a \u201cfamily\u201d because the boarders either paid money or rendered services for their room and board, and because \u201cthe membership of the group was subject to periodic change.\u201d Id. at 906. The trial court and the Commonwealth Court subsequently affirmed.\nThe question before this Court on appeal was therefore whether the lower tribunals had erred in concluding that the household did not constitute a \u201cfamily,\u201d i.e., a \u201csingle housekeeping unit,\u201d so as to qualify the home as a single-family dwelling under the applicable zoning ordinance. In concluding that the lower tribunals had, in fact, erred, this Court explained that a \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d is one which \u201cfunctions in the manner of a family residence,\u201d id. at 908, and noted that there was substantial evidence presented before the Board to establish that Miller\u2019s home was a \u201ccaring familial unit.\u201d Id. Specifically, this Court stated that\nThe individuals lived and cooked together as a single housekeeping unit. The same furnishings were throughout the house and the activities of the home were shared in by all occupants. Each occupant had access to all areas of the premises. There was only one kitchen, the meals were taken by all as a group in one sitting. The group attended social and religious functions together and celebrated holidays jointly. Ms. Anne. Henry, a clinical psychologist, testified\nI guess my biggest impression was a boarding house\u2014I figured was [sic] a big house and all these people would be wandering around not knowing anybody. I was very much impressed like I was going into a person\u2019s family. There is a lot of caring and sharing, and it is a really nice experience to visit there. Record p. 105.\n515 A.2d at 908.\nThe Court went on to note that in spite of this evidence, the Board had concluded that the home was a \u201ccommercial establishment for which [the homeowner] received income and provided services,\u201d rather than a \u201cfamily,\u201d solely because the residents paid Miller $200 per month for their room and board. Id. This Court rejected that reasoning, explaining\nThis [$200 per month] rate, particularly in view of the special care these residents require, does not suggest a profit motive. We also note that foster children are subsidized by public funds, and that fact has not been determinative of whether the living arrangement constituted a family unit. Similarly, in family units based upon blood and marital relationships the adult members quite frequently contribute to the maintenance of the unit. The mere fact that a member of the unit pays a fee for belonging to the unit does not transform the relationship unless it also appears that the profit motive is the basis for the relationship.\nId. at 908-09.\nThis Court likewise rejected the Board\u2019s rationale that the \u201clack of permanency\u201d of the residents supported the conclusion that the household was not a \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\u201d Id. at 909. While noting that the record reflected that only one of the residents had been living at the home for eight years or more, this Court stated that \u201cit is clear that this is not a transient establishment but rather that the residents usually remain for substantial periods of time and move only for health reasons or personal preference.\u201d Id. The Court further commented that \u201cthe focus for this purpose should be directed to the quality of the relationship during the period of residency rather than its duration.\u201d Id.\nBased on the foregoing analysis, this Court concluded that Miller\u2019s home constituted a \u201csingle-family dwelling\u201d under the terms of the ordinance at issue, in spite of both the monthly fee paid by the residents and the fact that only one resident had been living at the residence of eight years or more. Appellants now advance the same basic arguments that we rejected in Miller, but contend that the facts here are more compelling than those in Miller and thus, warrant a different conclusion. While we reject Appellants\u2019 argument that the facts of this case support a finding that the Retreat has a profit motive that is incompatible with the concept of \u201cfamily,\u201d we nevertheless agree that the Retreat cannot qualify as a \u201csingle-family detached dwelling\u201d under the Ordinance in light of the transience of its residents, and therefore hold that the Commonwealth Court erred in granting the Retreat its requested license.\nIn connection with their profit motive argument, Appellants point to Miller\u2019s statement that \u201cthe mere fact that a member of the unit pays a fee for belonging to the unit does not transform the relationship unless it also appears that the profit motive is the basis for the relationship.\u201d Id. at 908-09 (emphasis added). Applying that rationale here, Appellants argue that the lower tribunals should have concluded that the members of the Retreat do not qualify as a \u201cfamily\u201d under the North Abington Ordinance because, unlike the situation in Miller, the record evidence in the instant case suggests that there may be a \u201cprofit motive [that] is the basis for the relationship.\u201d Id. at 908. In support of this assertion, Appellants note that while Albert professes to be planning to operate the Retreat as a non-profit entity, this stated intention \u201cdoes not mean that Ms. Albert does not have a profit motive in mind for the [Retreat].\u201d Appellants\u2019 Brf. at 20 n. 6. Appellants emphasize that Albert testified and introduced evidence at the ZHB hearing that she intended to charge each of the residents of the Retreat somewhere between $2,000 and $3,000 per month, for a total monthly intake at full capacity of anywhere between $30,000 and $45,000. Meanwhile, Appellants point out that the Retreat will pay just $4,000 per month to lease the property from Albert and her siblings. Appellants acknowledge that rent will not be the only expense in operating the Retreat, but note that there was no evidence presented to the ZHB regarding any additional monthly expenses.\nDespite these assertions, we do not believe that our concern in Miller regarding profit-driven enterprises is even implicated here, because the record simply does not support the conclusion that a profit motive would be the basis for the Retreat\u2019s relationships. As an initial matter, Ms. Albert specifically testified at the ZHB hearing that she did not propose the project as a profit-making enterprise. R.R. at 70a. She further testified that she was \u201cprepared to make an appropriate pledge to recreational or educational youth of the township\u201d if the Retreat ultimately did turn a profit. See id. Moreover, when Appellants nevertheless urged the ZHB to deny the Retreat its permit in light of the possibility that it would earn a profit, the ZHB responded by explicitly conditioning the permit on the Retreat\u2019s organizing as a nonprofit corporation, which, according to Pennsylvania\u2019s Nonprofit Corporation Law, means that it may not have a \u201cpurpose involving pecuniary profit, incidental or otherwise.\u201d 15 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5103 (defining \u201cCorporation not-for profit\u201d). Given these facts, the ZHB did not abuse its discretion in failing to conclude that the Retreat was a profit-motivated enterprise that rendered its occupants something other than a \u201cfamily\u201d for purposes of the zoning requirements. In sum, we agree with the lower courts that the evidence, taken as a whole, does not suggest a profit motive that is incompatible with a traditional family setting, and thus, we reject Appellants\u2019 argument that Miller dictates that the Retreat\u2019s application should have been denied on that basis.\nAppellants next argue that the three lower tribunals erred in rejecting their argument that the Retreat should not be considered a \u201csingle-family detached dwelling\u201d because, unlike the members of a traditional family, the Retreat residents will come and go on a transient basis. We agree that the lower tribunals erred in this regard and thus reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court on that basis. While this Court has never before explicitly stated that transiency is incompatible with the notion of a single-family household, it is undeniable that inherent in the concept of \u201cfamily\u201d and, in turn, in the concept of a \u201csingle-family dwelling,\u201d is a certain expectation of relative stability and permanence in the composition of the familial unit. See, e.g., Open Door Alcoholism Program, Inc. v. Bd. of Adjustment of City of New Brunswick, 200 N.J.Super. 191, 491 A.2d 17, 21-22 (1985) (\u201c[I]n order for a group of unrelated persons living together as a single housekeeping unit to constitute a single family in terms of a zoning regulation, they must exhibit a kind of stability, permanency and functional lifestyle which is equivalent to that of the traditional family unit.\u201d); see also City of White Plains v. Ferraioli, 34 N.Y.2d 300, 357 N.Y.S.2d 449, 313 N.E.2d 756, 758 (1974) (\u201cSo long as a group home bears the generic character of a family unit as a relatively permanent household, and is not a framework for transients or transient living, it conforms to the purpose of the ordinance.\u201d); Planning and Zoning Comm\u2019n of the Town of Westport v. Synanon Foundation, Inc., 153 Conn. 305, 216 A.2d 442, 443 (1966) (concluding that \u201cever-changing\u201d group of individuals who slept, cooked, ate, worked, and carried on activities in a dwelling did not come within the meaning of the word \u201cfamily.\u201d) Indeed, one of the many benefits of single-family zoning districts is that they create residential neighborhoods in which the residents may develop a sense of community and a shared commitment to the common good of that community. Without some level of stability and permanence in the composition of the groups residing in such residential districts, this goal is necessarily subverted. See, e.g., 2 Rathkopf\u2019s The Law of Zoning and Planning \u00a7 23.27 (\u201cMany courts have used a so-called \u2018functional family\u2019 standard ... by considering whether the group possesses a family-like structure of household authority, functions as a relatively stable and integrated housekeeping unit, and whether the living arrangement is consistent with or likely to impact negatively the residential character of the neighborhood.\u201d) (emphasis added). Accordingly, we conclude that in order to qualify as a \u201csingle housekeeping unit,\u201d a group of individuals in a single household must not only function as a family within that household, but in addition, the composition of the group must be sufficiently stable and permanent so as not to be fairly characterized as purely transient.\nApplying this standard to the ease at hand, it is apparent that the Retreat cannot qualify as a \u201csingle housekeeping unit.\u201d Far from being a relatively stable and permanent assemblage, the residents of the Retreat will change on a fairly regular basis. In fact, the entire premise of the Retreat is to lodge its residents for only so long as is necessary to prepare them to return to their own families. See ZHB Op. at 12 (describing Retreat\u2019s proposed use as a \u201csober residential environment for fifteen, transient unrelated adults ....\u201d) (emphasis added); R.R. 49a-50a (a transitional living facility \u201cis not an end place,\u201d but rather, its residents \u201cmove though [it] to get home\u201d to their families). Thus, the average stay for a resident at the facility is expected to be just two to six months, see R.R. at 49a, 92a, and, as a result, the Retreat\u2019s entire population of six to fifteen women could turn over as many as six times a year. This level of instability and transience is simply incompatible with the single-family concept. Accord Open Door, 491 A.2d at 22 (finding that where the average stay of alcoholics in a halfway house was six months, the residents\u2019 affiliation with one another would be no different than if they were fellow residents of a boarding house, and thus the group did not possess the elements of stability and permanency associated with single-family occupancy); see also Act I, Inc., 704 A.2d at 735 (group home in which the residents\u2019 average stay was between eight and nine months did not have the same \u201cgeneral character\u201d as a single family dwelling because the arrangement was too \u201ctransient\u201d); Lakeside Youth Service v. Zoning Hearing Bd. of Upper Moreland Twp., 51 Pa.Cmwlth. 485, 414 A.2d 1115, 1116 (1980) (\u201cWe agree with the [trial court] that in view of the numbers of people entering and leaving the house and the transient nature of the principal residents that \u2018the basic social structure of the proposed use is simply too far removed from the ordinance\u2019s concept of \u2018single family dwelling\u2019 to be considered of \u2018the same general character\u2019 of that use.\u201d).\nWe recognize that there is language in Miller suggesting that the focus of the \u201cfamily\u201d inquiry \u201cshould be directed to the quality of the relationship during the period of residency rather than its duration.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). However, we regard this language as dicta, not a controlling holding. In fact, in reversing the Board\u2019s holding that the Miller household was too transient to qualify as a family, id. at 906, the Miller court specifically stated that the Board\u2019s characterization of the household as transient was unjustified, because \u201cit is clear that [the Miller household] is not a transient establishment but rather that the residents usually remain substantial periods of time and move only for health reasons or personal preference.\u201d Id. at 909. As such, this Court made clear that transience was simply not an issue in that case and thus, its subsequent commentary that the duration of residency is secondary to the quality of the relationship was nonbinding dicta that need not influence our analysis here.\nIn sum, we hold that the Commonwealth Court did not err in failing to And that the Retreat had a profit motive that was incompatible with the single family concept, but did err insofar as it failed to credit Appellants\u2019 argument that the Retreat could not qualify as a \u201csingle-family dwelling\u201d because of the transient nature of its residents. Accordingly, we reverse the order of the Commonwealth Court.\nFormer Justice LAMB did not participate in the decision of this case.\n. The Township also filed a Petition for Allowance of Appeal, seeking review of certain discrete aspects of the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision, but this Court denied that Petition. See Albert v. Zoning Hearing Bd. of North Abington Twp., 572 Pa. 709, 813 A.2d 844 (2002) (Table).\n. \"Dwelling Structure,\u201d in turn, is defined as \u201d[a]ny structure which shall contain one (1) or more dwelling units, not including a hotel, hospital, nursing home, dormitory, fraternity or sorority house, rooming house or boarding house.\u201d Ordinance \u00a7 11.123, R.R. at 503a. Finally, \"Rooming House\u201d is defined as \u201c[a] building containing a single dwelling unit and rooms for the rooming and/or boarding of between three (3) and ten (10) persons, by pre-arrangement for a definitive period of not less than one (1) week.\u201d Ordinance \u00a7 11.151, R.R. at 509a.\n. All four of the zoning ordinances at issue in these cases contained definitions of \"family,\u201d which essentially defined the term as a \"single housekeeping unit.\u201d\n. Appellants also argue that the Retreat should not qualify as a \"single-family detached dwelling\u201d because it will have a \"therapeutic or corrective purpose.\u201d See Appellants'Brf. at 20-21. However, Appellants did not raise this argument in their Petition for Allowance of Appeal, but rather addressed only the Retreat's purported profit motive and transient nature. Accordingly, we did not grant allocatur to consider the Retreat's alleged \"therapeutic or corrective purpose\u201d and will not address Appellants' argument in that regard here.\n. North Abington Township, which filed a brief in support of Appellants, and Appellee Zoning Hearing Board of North Abington Township suggest that our interpretation of the term \"family\u201d in Miller does not control here, because the ordinance at issue in that case specifically defined \"family\u201d as a \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d whereas \u201cfamily\u201d in the Ordinance at issue here is undefined. Appellants, on the other hand, take the position that Miller\u2019s analysis is applicable here, and we agree.\nAs we explained in Miller, when townships throughout the country first started creating single-family zoning districts, they left the term \u201cfamily\u201d undefined, leaving the resolution of its meaning to the courts. 515 A.2d at 906-07. When that approach created uncertainty and spurred significant litigation, townships began to define the term. Id. at 907. The \"essential element\u201d of the resulting definitions was that the occupants live together as a \"single housekeeping unit.\u201d Kenneth H. Young, 2 Anderson's American Law of Zoning \u00a7 9:30 (4th ed.1996); see also supra n. 3 and accompanying text; Miller, 515 A.2d at 907. The prevalence of this construction, in combination with the principle that zoning ordinances should be liberally construed to permit the broadest possible use of land, 53 P.S. \u00a7 10603.1, makes it apparent that \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d must be considered the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201cfamily\u201d in the zoning context. See Southco, Inc., 713 A.2d at 609 (\u201c[W]hen interpreting zoning ordinances, words not defined in the ordinance are to be construed in accordance with their plain and ordinary meaning.\u201d); see also Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 4th Ed. (2001) (defining \"family\u201d as \u201ca group of individuals living under one roof and [usually] under one head; Household\u201d). We therefore conclude that the Township, by declining to define \"family,\u201d has communicated its intent to have that term include any group living together as a \u201csingle housekeeping unit,\u201d making Miller\u2019s analysis wholly applicable here. See Bailey v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 569 Pa. 147, 801 A.2d 492, 502 n. 19 (2002) (\u201cWhen interpreting the meaning of municipal ordinances, we are guided by the principles of statutory construction.\u201d); 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921 (\u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\u201d).\nWe feel compelled to emphasize that, as Miller recognized, the members of a \u201csingle housekeeping unit\u201d need not be related by blood or marriage. 515 A.2d at 907; see also Edward H. Zeigi.er, Jr. et al\u201e 2 Rathkopf\u2019s The Law of Zoning and Planning \u00a7 3:14 (4th ed. 2003) (\u201cCourts have interpreted [single-housekeeping unit] in a rather elastic way, generally ruling that any living arrangement which makes use of unified housekeeping facilities satisfies such an ordinance.\"). Accordingly, local legislatures that have wished to place relational restrictions on \"families\" have had to do so explicitly. See, e.g., Appeal of Lynch Community Homes, Inc., 123 Pa.Cmwlth. 278, 554 A.2d 155, 156 n. 2 (1989) (ordinance defining \u201cfamily\u201d as \u201cany number of individuals living and cooking together as a single housekeeping unit, provided that not more than two (2) of such number are unrelated to all of the others by blood, marriage or legal adoption\u201d); Act I, Inc. v. Zoning Hearing Board, 704 A.2d 732, 734 (Pa.Commw.1997) (ordinance stating that \"family shall not include more than 4 persons who are not related to each other by blood, official foster relationship, marriage or adoption\"). Significantly, North Abington Township has taken no steps to limit the prevailing meaning of \"family\" to exclude certain combinations of individuals who are not related by blood or marriage. Accordingly, no such restrictions apply here.\n. Significantly, Appellants stop short of asserting that the record evidence actually establishes that the Retreat would generate a profit.\n. In concluding as such, we necessarily reject Appellants' assertion that we must find the Retreat to be profit-driven because it would be impossible for the Retreat not to generate a substantial profit when it will charge residents between $2,000 and $3,000 per month while paying just $4,000 per month in rent. Certainly, the $30,000-$45,000 that the Retreat expects to collect per month at full capacity is a substantial sum, but Albert explained that she had estimated the Retreat\u2019s expenses based on discussions with not only her accountants, but also representatives of other similar facilities, which charge their residents between $2,000 and $4,000 per month. R.R. at 87a. Moreover, Albert's attorney explained at the hearing that before opening, the Retreat would have to invest at least $50,000 to refurbish the existing facilities and that using the $2000 per month figure, the Retreat expected to lose money until it had at least ten residents. R.R. at 85a-86a; 88a. Finally, Albert made clear that the amount she would charge the residents was not set in stone. R.R. at 87a. As she explained, until the Retreat began operating and incurring daily expenses, she could not state with certainty how much income it would need to break even. R.R. at 87a-88a; see also R.R. at 84a-85a (representations of Albert\u2019s counsel). Under these circumstances, this Court cannot simply presume that the Retreat will generate a profit, and certainly has no basis on which to conclude that it is explicitly profit-driven.\n. We also reject Appellants\u2019 alternative argument, buried in a footnote in their brief, see Appellants\u2019 Brf. at 20 n. 6, that we remand the case for the development of a more detailed record regarding the Retreat\u2019s expected expenses and income. Simply put, the mere fact that residents will likely pay substantial sums to stay at the Retreat does not, in and of itself, require that this Court remand the case for more evidence, when other record evidence makes clear that a profit motive is not the basis for the relationships at issue. Cf. Eichlin v. Zoning Hearing Bd. of New Hope Borough, 671 A.2d 1173 (Pa.Commw.1996) (payment of rent \u201cis not conclusive of a profit motive\u201d)."}
