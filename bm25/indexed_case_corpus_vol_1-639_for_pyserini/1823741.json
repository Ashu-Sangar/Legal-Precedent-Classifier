{"id": "1823741", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Chief Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Commonwealth Court affirming the decision of the Insurance Commissioner that the appellant violated the Unfair Insurance Practices Act (\u201cUIPA\u201d) when it rescinded the policy of appellee, Edgar Miller. The question presented on appeal is whether UIPA precludes the common law remedy of rescission ab initio of an insurance policy which was fraudulently obtained.\nIn November of 1984, Mr. Edgar Miller applied for homeowner\u2019s insurance with Metropolitan Property and Liability Insurance Company (\u201cMetropolitan\u201d). The Metropolitan agent completed the application based upon the information provided by Mr. Miller. In response to questions regarding any incidents of loss within the previous five years, Mr. Miller replied, \u201cNo,\u201d which was,then recorded'on th\u00e9 application. Mr. Miller then signed, the completed application. Immediately above the signature of Mr. Miller was the following passage:\nI hereby apply for the insurance indicated and represent (1) I have read this application, and (2) the statements hereon are correct.\nAt the time he signed the application, Mr. Miller paid Metropolitan a premium of Four Hundred Thirty-eight Dollars ($438) for the policy.\nOn December 5, 1984, Metropolitan made a routine \u201cspot check\u201d call to Mr. Miller to ask about incidents of prior losses. Appellee advised the Metropolitan agent that he had sustained a loss of Two Thousand Dollars ($2,000) when a shed had burned down. The agent then determined that this misrepresentation was not material and merely exchanged the previous answer on the application with the information provided by Mr. Miller. Metropolitan made no further inquiries or investigation regarding this inconsistency. The policy was then issued on December 18, 1984.\nIn May 1985, Mr. Miller filed \u2019a claim for fire loss to his property totaling over Eight Thousand Dollars ($8,000). Through its claim investigation, Metropolitan discovered that Mr. Miller had suffered three prior fire losses within the past five years totaling in excess of Seventeen Thousand Dollars ($17,000). In November 1985, Metropolitan notified Mr. Miller that his policy had been rescinded effective December 18, 1984, the date the policy was issued.\nAppellee, Miller, contested the rescission of his policy before the Insurance Commissioner, arguing that the Unfair Insurance Practices Act of 1974, 40 Pa.S. \u00a7 1171.5, limited the means of terminating an insurance policy to cancellation or non-renewal. In either event Metropolitan would be barred from rescinding the policy retroactively. The Insurance Commissioner agreed, and the Commonwealth Court affirmed that decision. 537 A.2d 53.\nPreliminarily, we note that the present case involves an issue similar to that addressed in Metropolitan Property and Liability Insurance Company v. Insurance Commissioner (\u201cBonnie Beck\u201d), 517 Pa. 218, 535 A.2d 588 (1987) (plurality opinion). In Bonnie Beck we were called to interpret the language of Act 78, 40 Pa.C.S. 1008.1, et seq., concerning automobile insurance. The insured parties in Bonnie Beck had made misrepresentations as to their moving violations at the time they applied for automobile insurance. The plurality opinion, authored by Mr. Justice McDermott and joined by one other Justice, held that the legislature, through its enactment of such a pervasive and encompassing regulation, intended to foreclose any previously held common law right not set forth in the'Act. Therefore, the insurer was precluded from rescinding the policy ab initio as provided by common law contract principles. In a concurring opinion, joined by Mr. Justice Flaherty and Mr. Justice Papadakos, this author stated:\nIn my view the fact that the legislature decided to provide a procedure for cancellation or refusal to renew policies and placed these matters under the auspices of the insurance commissioner does not warrant the inference of the elimination of the well recognized contract remedy of rescission where a fraud has occurred. (Footnote omitted.)\nId., 517 Pa. at 232, 535 A.2d at 595.\nThe concurring result was justified because the misrepresentations made by the insured concerning moving violations were not related to the claims of loss involved, vandalism and burglary.\nIn the present case, we are again called to interpret the legislative intent regarding the continued application of basic common law contract principles to insurance policies. Prior to the enactment of UIPA, an insurance policy was viewed as an ordinary contract. Cleland Simpson Co. v. Fireman\u2019s Insurance Co., 392 Pa. 67, 140 A.2d 41 (1958); Eastern Assoc. Coal Co. v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 632 F.2d 1068 (3rd Cir.1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 986, 101 S.Ct. 2320, 68 L.Ed.2d 843 (1981); Blair v. Berkshire Life Insurance Co., 429 F.2d 996 (3rd Cir.1970). As such, it was subject to the laws that traditionally governed contractual relationships. Those laws render voidable a contract whose formation was procured by the fraudulent representations of one of the parties. D\u2019Allessandro v. Durham Life Insurance Co., 503 Pa. 33, 467 A.2d 1303 (1983); College Watercolor Group, Inc. v. William H. Newbauer, Inc., 468 Pa. 103, 360 A.2d 200 (1976). An insurance policy was similarly voidable by an insurer upon a finding that an insured had fraudulently misrepresented material information. See, e.g., Prudential Insurance Co. v. Pagano, 407 Pa. 473, 181 A.2d 319 (1962); Allstate Insurance Co. v. Stinger, 400 Pa. 533, 163 A.2d 74 (1960); A.G. Allebach, Inc. v. Hurley, 373 Pa.Super. 41, 540 A.2d 289 (1988); Baldwin v. Prudential Insurance Co., 215 Pa.Super. 434, 258 A.2d 660 (1969).\nWhenever we are called to interpret a statute and determine the legislative intent, the analysis must necessarily begin with the Statutory Construction Act. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921 et seq. Under that Act an implication alone cannot be interpreted as abrogating existing law. The legislature must affirmatively repeal existing law or specifically preempt accepted common law for prior law to be disregarded.\nThe UIPA was enacted to! codify and regulate the practices of the insurance industry. In its declaration of purpose the legislature stated:\nThe purpose of this act is to regulate trade practices in the business of insurance in accordance with the intent of Congress as expressed in the act of Congress of March 9, 1945 (Public Law 15, 79th Congress) (footnote omitted), by defining or providing for the determination of all such practices in this state which constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices and by prohibiting the trade practices so defined or determined.\n40 Pa.S. \u00a7 1171.2.\nThroughout the Act the practices determined to be unfair are expressly stated. Included in those practices which are unfair is the cancellation or- refusal to renew a policy \u201cunless the policy was obtained through material misrepresentation, fraudulent statements, omissions or concealment of fact material to the acceptance of the risk or to the hazard assumed by the company.\u201d 40 Pa.S. \u00a7 1171.5. This provision makes no reference to the common law right to rescission. Such an omission cannot be interpreted as an intention to foreclose such a long-standing right. In fact the Act itself makes it clear that the provisions set forth are not all encompassing and may be supplemented by existing law. Section 1171.15 states:\n(a) The act of June 5, 1947 (P.L. 445, No. 202) known as \u201cThe Insurance Unfair Practices Act,\u201d is repealed absolutely.\n(b) All other acts and parts of acts are repealed insofar as they are inconsistent herewith.\nThe right to rescind a contract under traditional common law remedies, where the contract was procured through fraudulent means, cannot be considered inconsistent with the provisions of the UIPA. The UIPA seeks to encourage fair practices within the insurance industry by imposing sanctions upon companies who engage in deceptive practices. The Act, however, was not intended to assist the policy holder in attempting to defraud the insurance company. The purpose of the UIPA in establishing protection for the insurance consumer from unfair practices being employed by the insurance industry is not in conflict with the traditional equitable remedies that would prevent the policy holder from attempting to defraud the company. There is no basis for a finding of an implied abrogation of the common law remedy of rescission which would preclude the industry from redress for fraudulent misrepresentations made by policy holders. Such a construction would be unreasonable. ]\nThus, with both common law; and statutory remedies available, the determination of whether a remedy provided by the Act is sufficient should be left to the courts. The common law contract principle of rescission should not be precluded as an alternative remedy if the court finds those provided by the Act insufficient.\nIn this case the appellee, Mr. Miller, falsely informed Metropolitan that he had not suffered any property loss during the previous five years, when in fact he had suffered three separate incidents of property loss amounting to claims in excess of $17,000. This misrepresentation was certainly material to the risk accepted by Metropolitan. At a later inquiry the appellee, Mr. Miller, informed a Metropolitan agent that he had suffered a minor loss to a shed amounting to a $2,000 claim. While the appellee admitted to property loss during the previous five years, the amount of damage was still far below' what actually occurred. Again this misrepresentation was material to the risk accepted by Metropolitan. Under basic contract principles, these fraudulent statements would certainly justify the rescission of the policy after discovery of the misrepresentations. Thus, the Commonwealth Court and the Insurance Commissioner improperly precluded Metropolitan from exercising its common law right of rescission.\nAccordingly, the decision of the Commonwealth Court affirming the action of the Insurance Commissioner is reversed.\nZAPPALA, J., files a concurring opinion in which LARSEN and McDERMOTT, JJ., join."}
