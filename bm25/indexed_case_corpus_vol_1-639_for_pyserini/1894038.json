{"id": "1894038", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nTo the within complaint in equity the defendants filed a preliminary objection in the nature of a demurrer; the lower court sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint.\nThe City of New Kensington established its own planning commission and adopted the county land subdivision regulations as its own. The City recorded a plan of lots without the prior approval of the county planning commission. Without indicating our approval or disapproval of the procedure followed here, the action of the lower court in sustaining the demurrer must be affirmed.\nPlaintiff has not pled any specific damage or injury to his property that would entitle him to equitable relief. The enforcement of zoning restrictions is reserved to those who are or will be damaged by their lack of observance. Even an adjoining property owner is required to show that his property is damaged as a result of a violation of the zoning regulation before he has a right to appeal to the courts for aid in enjoining the continuing infraction of the law. Phillips v. Griffiths, 366 Pa. 468, 77 A. 2d 375 (1951); Shoemaker v. York Junior College, 30 Pa. D. & C. 2d 750 (1963).\nNo damage to the property of plaintiff-appellant is shown and none is alleged hence, plaintiff has no standing to institute this action.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents."}
