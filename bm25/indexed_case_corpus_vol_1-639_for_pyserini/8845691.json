{"id": "8845691", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nPlaintiffs sued to recover damages for injuries received by the minor in a collision between a car driven by the minor and a truck operated by defendants\u2019 driver in the course of the employex*\u2019s business. The accident happened about 5:45 in the morning of March 25, 1932, at the intersection of Allegheny Avenue and Broad Street in the City of Philadelphia. The action was tried by Honorable Edwin O. Lewis without a jury, under the Act of 1874, P. L. 109. The minor plaintiff was driving west on Allegheny Avenue and defendants\u2019 truck was coming south on Broad Street. The lower court found defendants\u2019 driver guilty of negligence, absolved the minor of contributoi*y negligence, and awarded damages in favor of both the minor and his parents. Defendants appealed.\nThe sole question before us is whether or not the court erred in determining the minor was not guilty of contributory negligence. We have read the evidence in connection with the vai\u2019ious exhibits and find it ample to sustain the court\u2019s conclusion exonerating the minor from negligence. As that finding has the weight and effect of a jury\u2019s verdict (Armstrong Co. v. Rearic, 315 Pa. 133), it must be received by us unless so grossly in conflict with the testimony as to warrant us in. holding the coui*t abused its discretion in reaching its conclusion. In this case we would not be justified in so holding.\nJudgments affirmed."}
