{"id": "1213344", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nThe Commonwealth appeals from an order requiring the Secretary of Revenue to issue to appellee a license to operate a motor vehicle.\nThe case began in the court below on October 1,1940, by the appellee\u2019s petition stating that on March 3,1939, the Secretary of Revenue suspended his license on the ground that he was \u201cincompetent to operate a motor vehicle;\u201d see section 615 of the Vehicle Code, Act of May 1, 1929, P. L. 905, Art. VI, section 6.15, as amended by the Act of June 29, 1937, P. L. 2329, 75 PS section 192. The petition set forth that a hearing was held by the Secretary, followed by suspension based on the fact that appellee \u201chad been confined in the Selinsgrove State Colony for Epileptics,... having been discharged therefrom on April 22, 1932.\u201d Petitioner also averred that since that date doctors had \u201cpronounced him well\u201d and that he had \u201crequested the Department of Revenue to reinstate his operating privilege and they have consistently refused to do so,\u201d inter alia, as late as September 9, 1940. The court made an order granting the appeal \u201cfrom the order of the Secretary of Revenue suspending his [appellee\u2019s] operator\u2019s license.\u201d On'November 1, 1940, the Commonwealth appeared and moved to quash the appeal on the ground that it was not taken within the 30-day period specified for such appeals by section 615.\nThe next, thing appearing in the record is entitled \u201cDecree Sustaining Appeal\u201d and is dated April 9,1941. On April 17,1941, the Commonwealth filed exceptions to the order of April 9, 1941, repeating its objection that the appeal was not taken in time and that the order \u201cattempts to dispose of the entire case; whereas, the only matter before the Court for consideration was a preliminary Motion to Quash . .\nThe right to operate a motor vehicle on the public highway is subject to regulation under the police power and such regulations have been embodied in the Vehicle Code. A qualified person may not be deprived of the privilege of obtaining a license by arbitrary action of the officers entrusted with the administration of the code. If an applicant is aggrieved by the action of the Secretary, section 616 provides for an appeal to the common pleas where the case is heard de novo. Commonwealth v. Funk, 323 Pa. 390, 399, 186 A. 65; Commonwealth v. Cronin, 336 Pa. 469, 9 A.2d 408. There will, no doubt, be common agreement that a person afflicted with epilepsy is \u201cincompetent or unable to exercise reasonable and ordinary control over a vehicle\u201d on the public highway.\nIt is elementary that an order cannot be sustained unless it is supported by the record. The certified record consists merely of the Petition, the Motion to Quash, and the two orders of the court quoted above. They do not support the action of the court. The order of April 9, 1941, recites, \u201c. . . it appearing to the Court . . .\u201d, etc. The record does not show from what evidence it \u201cappeared.\u201d In the opinion written to support the order of March 31,1942, it is said that \u201cRegarding the applicant\u2019s condition, sufficient evidence has been submitted to the Court to indicate that the appellant is not now suffering from epilepsy, and that he has been free from an attack for a period of eight years. This would indicate that he should have his license restored until such time as he might be so unfortunate as to suffer from a recurrence of the epileptic attacks. In order that the Department of Revenue might not be under the necessity of constantly and continually investigating the matter of appellant\u2019s condition we believe he should submit annually with his application for a driver\u2019s license a doctor\u2019s certificate certifying to his condition with respect to the question of whether he is or is not suffering from epileptic attacks and will so order.\u201d There is nothing in the record certified to us advising in what circumstances that evidence was submitted, nor what it was. Was there a hearing de novo? What were the issues to be heard, and on what pleadings?\nIn Commonwealth v. Cronin, 336 Pa. 469, 9 A.2d 408, a case dealing with suspension of an operator\u2019s license, we said that \u201c. . . it is our duty to examine the testimony to determine whether the findings of the court below are supported by competent evidence, and to correct any conclusions of law erroneously made . . .\u201d\nIn the absence of evidence of something to . show on what the learned court based its conclusions, and whether the evidence is sufficient, we must reverse the order. Apparently the learned court confused action by the Secretary under section 615 of the code, from which the appeal was taken, with possible action under section 615.1, which appeared in the amendment of June 27, 1939, P. L. 1135, 75 PS section 192.1, and provided that the Secretary should conduct a hearing on the restoration of the privilege of applying for an operator\u2019s license, a procedure not provided for in the code before amendment. There has been no hearing under section 615.1. This confusion appears from the opinion of the court which states :\u25a0 \u201cOn September 9,1940, in reply to an inquiry from Mr. Irwin\u2019s counsel, the Department of Revenue definitely refused Mr. Irwin the privilege of applying for an operator\u2019s license. Prom this refusal to permit an application to be filed an appeal was taken within thirty days, to wit, on October 1, 1940.\u201d The refusal to reconsider the action of March 3,1939, suspending' the operator\u2019s license was treated as a deprivation \u201cof the privilege of applying for an operator\u2019s license\u201d under the amendment of 1939, made to section 616. Section 615.1 provides that \u201cThe secretary may suspend the privilege of any person to apply for an operator\u2019s license or learner\u2019s permit after a hearing before the secretary or his representative . . .\u201d The only hearing before the Secretary was that held under section 615 which was held before the amendment of section 615.1 was passed. The 30-day period for appeal from that order of March 3, 1939, could not be extended by applications to rehear it. It is well settled that efforts at rehearings do npt extend the appellate period fixed by statute: cf. Henry\u2019s Estate, 290 Pa. 537, 139 A. 198; Wise v. Cambridge Springs Borough, 262 Pa. 139, 142, 104 A. 863; section 3 of the Act of May 9, 1889, P. L. 158, 12 PS section 1163, limiting appeals to the time fixed by statute.\nWe may add that an applicant whose privilege has been suspended is not without remedy. He may proceed under sections 615.1 and 616 (sections 9 and 10 of the amendment of 1939, P. L. 1135) and have a hearing before the Secretary with the right to appeal if aggrieved.\nThe order appealed from is reversed; costs to be paid by the appellee.\n\u201cNow, Marcli Slst, 1942, ... It is further ordered that the Department of Revenue, Bureau of Highway Patrol and Safety be and it is hereby directed to issue to the appellant, Kenneth Irwin, a license certifying to his privilege of operating motor vehicles in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the year ending January 31, 1943, upon appellant\u2019s filing a new application, paying the required license fee for the current year, and furnishing to the Department a letter from a competent physician certifying that appellant on the date of the certificate is free from epileptic attacks and competent to operate a motor vehicle in so far as epilepsy is concerned. The applicant, Kenneth Irwin, is ordered and directed to submit a similar certificate with any subsequent application filed by him for an operator\u2019s privilege.\u201d\nClause (b) provides: \u201cThe secretary may suspend the operator\u2019s license or learner\u2019s permit of any person, after a hearing before the secretary or his representative, . . . whenever the secretary finds upon sufficient evidence ... (5) That such person is incompetent or unable to exercise reasonable and ordinary control over a vehicle.\u201d\n\u201cAnd now, April 9th, 1941, it appearing to the Court that the official withdrawal of operating privilege was for the reason \u2018incompetent to operate a motor vehicle\u2019 and that the same notice further states that \u2018this notice also voids application for 1939 operator\u2019s license\u2019, and it further appearing that the said suspension was due to the applicant (appellant) having been in an epileptic hospital, and it further appearing that this appeal is from the action of the Department of Revenue by letter,- dated September 9th, 1940, depriving the said applicant (appellant) not only a rehearing but depriving him of the privilege of applying for an operator\u2019s license; therefore, it. is ordered, adjudged and decreed that the motion to quash the appeal .is. overruled, and the Department of Revenue, Bureau of Highway Patrol and Safety, is ordered and directed to restore forthwith to the appellant, Kenneth Irwin, the privilege of applying for an operator\u2019s license as provided under the Act of Assembly of June 27th, 1939, P.D. 1135, Section 10.\u201d"}
