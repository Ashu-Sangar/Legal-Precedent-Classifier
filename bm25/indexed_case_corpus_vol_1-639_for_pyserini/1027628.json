On the evening of October 20, 1914, he was waiting at a station of the defendant company for the purpose of becoming a passenger on one of its trains. At about 8:30 he was seen dozing in the station room, and dozed on until the train was heard coming. Some one called to him, telling Mm of its approach. He seized his valise, rushed out to the platform along the railway track, and was struck by the pilot beam of the locomotive of the train he intended to take. At the point where he was struck the approaching train could have been seen for six hundred feet; the headlight of the locomotive was burning, and there were six lights about the station.
