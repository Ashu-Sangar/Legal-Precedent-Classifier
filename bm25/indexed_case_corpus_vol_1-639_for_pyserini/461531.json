{"id": "461531", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nCAPPY, Justice.\nThe question presented in this appeal is whether the absolute privilege afforded a sexual assault counselor\u2019s records is waived when the assault victim releases the counseling records to the Commonwealth. We affirm the Superior Court\u2019s holding that the minor sexual abuse victim and his family waived the privilege protecting the victim\u2019s family therapy counseling records when they permitted the prosecution to have access to these records.\nAppellee Davis, who is the victim\u2019s stepfather, separated from the victim\u2019s mother in 1989. The victim (P.P.), along with his mother, sister, and biological father, underwent family counseling at the Family Institute of Philadelphia (Family Institute) beginning in February of 1991. During these counseling sessions in 1991, P.P. first disclosed his stepfather\u2019s alleged acts of sexual abuse against him, which P.P. stated began in 1983, when P.P. was 6 years old, and continued until 1986. P.P. was 14 years old at the time of trial.\nPrior to trial, through a subpoena duces tecum, Davis sought from the Family Institute the treating therapist\u2019s records of P.P.\u2019s family therapy sessions. Family Institute filed a motion to quash the subpoena. Davis' contended that because the prosecution had access to P.P.\u2019s family therapy records and intended to call P.P.\u2019s family therapist at trial, the trial court should allow Davis access to these records in order for him to properly conduct cross-examination. The trial judge ruled P.P.\u2019s family therapy records were privileged pursuant to the sexual assault counselor privilege, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5945.1(b), and quashed the subpoena. Appellee Davis was subsequently tried non-jury and convicted of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, corruption of a minor, and endangering the welfare of a child. Davis was sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment of not less than five (5) years nor more than ten (10) years, to be followed by a consecutive five (5) year period of probation imposed for corruption of a minor.\nOn direct appeal, Davis, inter alia, challenged the trial court\u2019s quashal of the subpoena duces tecum, arguing that this quashal resulted in a violation of his constitutional rights under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions, including his right to confront his accusers, to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses, and to due process of law. The Commonwealth contended Davis is seeking P.P.\u2019s counseling records to substantiate Davis\u2019 suspicion that P.P.\u2019s therapist believes P.P. is a \u201cpathological liar\u201d, and has noted such an observation in her counseling records. The Commonwealth asserted that even if P.P.\u2019s records contain such an observation by P.P.\u2019s therapist, it would be inadmissible expert opinion evidence and would not have been admissible for purposes of impeaching P.P.\u2019s credibility at trial.\nThe Superior Court rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cimproper purpose\u201d argument, stating:\nif those records do, in fact, contain the clinical observation of the therapist that the victim was a \u201cpathological liar,\u201d ... this diagnosis would have been relevant and admissible to impeach the victim\u2019s credibility at trial. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary defines a \u201cpathological liar\u201d as \u201ca person who habitually tells lies so exaggerated or bizarre that they are suggestive of mental disorder. Id. Such a diagnosis would have impacted upon the victim\u2019s ability to perceive events and to truthfully relate the facts to which he testified at trial.\nCommonwealth v. Davis, 437 Pa.Super. 471, at 490, 650 A.2d 452, at 462 (1994). Citing Commonwealth v. Gibbs, 434 Pa.Super. 280, 642 A.2d 1132 (1994), the Superior Court reasoned that P.P. and his family had waived the privilege protecting P.P.\u2019s counseling records when they permitted the Commonwealth to have access to these same records, pointing out that the Commonwealth had even offered the testimony of P.P.\u2019s family therapist at trial, albeit unsuccessfully. The Superior Court held the trial court erred in quashing the subpoena. The Superior Court was unable to determine whether Davis had been prejudiced by this error, however, since the court had no way of knowing whether the trial court\u2019s withholding of the contents of these records from Davis had contributed to his conviction. The Superior Court vacated judgment of sentence and remanded the matter for the trial court to make this determination after Davis has had an opportunity to review P.P.\u2019s therapy records. The Commonwealth then filed its petition for allowance of appeal with this Court, which we granted.\nWe have previously ruled that the sexual assault counselor privilege is absolute. See Commonwealth v. Wilson, 529 Pa. 268, 602 A.2d 1290 (1992), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 977, 112 S.Ct. 2952, 119 L.Ed.2d. 574 (1992). This privilege prohibits the disclosure of both oral communications and records created during the course of the confidential relationship, absent the victim\u2019s consent. Id. The Superior Court appropriately observed that the statutory privilege necessarily precludes the revelation of protected information both to the Commonwealth and to the defense. See Commonwealth v. Gibbs, supra. This privilege is waived, however, when the Commonwealth is accorded access to the information which the Legislature has intended to protect as confidential. See, id. In such a situation as this, the statutory privilege must yield to the defendant\u2019s rights of confrontation and compulsory process. See Commonwealth v. Lloyd, 523 Pa. 427, 567 A.2d 1357 (1989).\nThe Superior Court was correct in recognizing that P.P. and his family waived any privilege to the information contained in these records by giving the prosecution access to them. Davis was entitled to this information in order to confront the witnesses at trial, regardless of the appropriateness of his designs as to use at trial of the information hypothetically contained in these records. The Superior Court appropriately recognized that a new trial may not be required if the trial court\u2019s denying Davis access to P.P.\u2019s counseling records is shown to have been harmless error. See Commonwealth v. French, 396 Pa.Super. 436, 578 A.2d 1292 (1990), aff'd, 531 Pa. 42, 611 A.2d 175 (1992).\nAlthough the trial court could interpret, from the language employed in the Superior Court\u2019s opinion which addresses the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cimproper purpose\u201d argument, that if a new trial is necessary, it has been instructed to admit testimony from P.P.\u2019s files bearing on P.P.\u2019s credibility if offered by Davis, we do not agree with the Commonwealth that reversal of the Superior Court\u2019s decision is called for in the instant matter. The Superior Court\u2019s discussion as to the admissibility of information regarding P.P.\u2019s ability to tell the truth which hypothetically could be found in P.P.\u2019s records should not be interpreted as binding on the trial court on remand or as having precedential value. See, e.g., In re Kenin\u2019s Trust Estate, 343 Pa. 549, 23 A.2d 837 (1942) (\u201cin every case, what is actually decided is the law applicable to the particular facts; all other conclusions are but obiter dicta.\u201d)\nWe thus affirm the order of the Superior Court, vacating judgment of sentence and remanding the matter to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing on whether the trial court\u2019s error was harmless.\nMONTEMURO, J., who was sitting by designation, did not participate in the decision of this case.\nCASTILLE, J., concurs in the result.\n. The sexual assault counselor\u2019s privilege, as set forth at 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 5945.1(b), provides:\n(b) Privilege.\u2014\n(1) No sexual assault counselor may, without the written consent of the victim, disclose the victim\u2019s confidential oral or written communications to the counselor nor consent to be examined in any court or criminal proceeding.\n. 18 Pa.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3101, 3123(5).\n. 18 Pa.S. \u00a7 6301(a).\n. 18 Pa.S. \u00a7 4304.\n. No further penalty was imposed for Davis\u2019 conviction of endangering the welfare of a child.\n. Appellee\u2019s brief on appeal raises a number of issues upon which he received an adverse ruling from the Superior Court in this matter. These issues are not before this Court, as allowance of appeal was not requested and granted as to them. See Pa.R.A.P. 1115(a)(3); Commonwealth v. Rush, 522 Pa. 379, 562 A.2d 285 (1989)."}
