{"id": "848164", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nOne of the stipulations contained in the contract sued on is : \u201c The entire policy shall be void .... if the interest of the insured be not truly stated therein ; .... or if the interest of the insured be other than unconditional and sole ownership.\u201d The uncontradicted evidence was that the title to the property was in the plaintiff and his wife jointly. This, in the absence of any proof of fraud or mistake, as to the insertion of the stipulation above quoted, was a flat bar to plaintiff\u2019s recovery. There was therefore no error in directing a verdict for defendant.\nJudgment affirmed."}
