{"id": "1785938", "contents": "Opinion of the Court\nHUTCHINSON, Justice.\nThe estate of claimant Marcelino Garcia appealed to this Court from a February 26, 1982 Commonwealth Court order reversing a November 16, 1982 order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board. The Board had set aside a November 7, 1977 referee\u2019s decision which had dismissed claimant\u2019s fatal claim petition on the basis that the death of the claimant\u2019s son was intentionally self-inflicted. Because the Board erred in substituting its own resolution of the competing inferences from the evidence in this case to find an ultimate fact contrary to the factfinding of the referee, the only legitimate factfinder, see Page\u2019s Department Store v. Velardi, 464 Pa. 276, 282, 346 A.2d 556, 559 (1975); Universal Cyclops Steel Corp. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board, 9 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 176, 182, 305 A.2d 757, 761 (1973), we affirm Commonwealth Court.\nMr. Marcelino Garcia, the father of the decedent, filed a fatal claim petition with the Bureau of Workmen\u2019s Compensation. The claimant lived at his home with Joseph Garcia and claimed benefits as a dependent of his son. Bethlehem denied liability for compensation on its assertion that the decedent\u2019s death was \u201cthe result of a voluntary leap from a building.\u201d The referee dismissed the fatal claim petition, concluding that claimant was partially dependent on the decedent but that decedent\u2019s injury was \u201cintentionally self-inflicted, within the meaning of Section 301(a) of the [Workman\u2019s Compensation] Act....\u201d 77 P.S. \u00a7 431 (Supp.1982-83). The referee found:\n[T]hat the decedent, through voluntary act, purposely and intentionally jumped or fell from the south window of the small bag house, thereby sustaining fatal injuries, based on the following facts ...:\n(a) Decedent\u2019s work station was not in the small bag house and decedent had no occupational reason to be in said location on June 22, 1975,\n(b) Claimant\u2019s manner and attitude was different in the month next preceding his death in that he was unusually quiet,\n(c) On June 22, 1975, shortly before his fall, decedent\u2019s skin coloration was pale and he appeared to be short of breath,\n(d) Decedent climbed a railing 42 inches in height and crossed over an opening or a gap 27 inches in width and approximately 13 feet in depth to reach the south windowsill of the small bag house, a condition precedent making it extremely improbable for the decedent to have accidentally fallen from said windowsill,\n(e) Decedent\u2019s apparent downward exit being head first,\n(f) Decedent\u2019s helmet and gloves being dropped or thrown from said small bag house window prior to decedent\u2019s fall,\n(g) Decedent\u2019s pre-existing deteriorating physical condition, and\n(h) No evidence of negligent or criminal activity by another or others to cause said incident.\nWhere the defense interposed by an employer to a compensation claim is that the employee committed suicide \u201cthe burden of proof of such fact shall be upon the employer.\u201d Wellinger v. Brackenridge Borough, 149 Pa.Superior Ct. 394, 395, 27 A.2d 716, 717 (1942). This is simply a recognition of the legal \u201cpresumption\u201d against suicide. Id., 149 Pa.Superior Ct. at 395, 27 A.2d at 717. As Judge Craig correctly stated in the Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion in this case:\nTo rebut the presumption against suicide, the employer must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that death was intentionally self-inflicted. Wellinger v. Brackenridge Borough, 149 Pa.Superior Ct. 394, 27 A.2d 716 (1942); Ewing v. Alan Wood Steel Co., 138 Pa.Superior Ct. 519, 12 A.2d 121 (1940).\nHere, the referee formally concluded that the proofs more than met that standard; he held that \u201c[defendant proved by clear and convincing evidence that decedent\u2019s injury and resulting death on 6/22/75 was intentionally self-inflicted within the meaning of Section 301(a) of the Act.\u201d\nWhere the facts permit an inference of accidental death as well as an inference of suicide, the choice between those inferences is for the factfinder and not for the reviewing authority. Rittenberg v. Abbott Laboratories, 158 Pa.Superior Ct. 400, 45 A.2d 400 (1946); Hunter v. American Oil, 136 Pa.Superior Ct. 563, 7 A.2d 479 (1939). The referee\u2019s findings based on such an inference must be sustained unless \u201cthe evidence to the contrary is so clear, positive and credible and either uncontradicted or so indisputable in weight and amount as to justify\u201d setting aside the decision. Brecker v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal and Iron Co., 138 Pa.Superior Ct. 421, 424, 10 A.2d 827, 828 (1940).\n65 Pa. Commonwealth Ct. 59, 62-63, 441 A.2d 518, 519-20 (1982) (footnotes omitted).\nSimply because the employer had the burden to show suicide, appellate intrusion into the factfinding process is not warranted where there is sufficient competent evidence to support the referee\u2019s finding. There can be no question that such evidence may be circumstantial, as here. Indeed, the referee\u2019s underlying findings of the circumstance from which the referee could infer that decedent committed suicide are fully supported by the record.\nThe presence or absence of record evidence showing decedent had suicidal tendencies might be proper argument to the referee but it goes only to the weight of the evidence and is thus irrelevant here. The circumstances here show that the referee could properly conclude that the decedent voluntarily jumped out of a window and died from the fall. When the referee found suicide, a finding supported by competent evidence, he converted that likelihood into a factual finding insulated from review by the Compensation Board. Page\u2019s Department Store, supra; Universal Cyclops Steel Corp., supra. We, therefore, affirm.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion in which ROBERTS, C.J., and ZAPPALA, J., join.\n. Marcelino Garcia died April 1, 1977 at the age of 83. His estate now prosecutes this appeal."}
