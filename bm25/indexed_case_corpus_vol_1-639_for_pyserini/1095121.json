{"id": "1095121", "contents": "Pee Cueiam,\nWhen this case was here before (McGrath v. Pennsylvania Sugar Company, 282 Pa. 265), we held that the court below had jurisdiction and that the issues involved were for the jury. A reading of the present record shows the evidence at the last trial to be at least equally as strong for plaintiff as that produced at the former trial; which is all that need be said in disposing of this appeal, except that we find no reversible error, in the charge or otherwise.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
