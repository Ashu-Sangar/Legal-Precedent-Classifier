{"id": "1276824", "contents": "OPINION\nNIGRO, Justice.\nIn these consolidated appeals, Appellants contend that the Superior Court improperly reversed the orders of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County granting their respective motions to suppress evidence. Specifically, Appellant David M. Torres a/k/a Michael Williams (\u201cTorres\u201d) appeals from the judgment of the Superior Court reversing the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County granting his motion to suppress evidence seized, pursuant to a search warrant, from his residence at 5631 Rippey Street, Apartment C-2 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Appellant Elijah Williams a/k/a Bob Torres (\u201cWilliams\u201d) appeals from the judgment of the Superior Court reversing the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County granting his motion to suppress evidence seized, pursuant to search warrants, from 5631 Rippey Street, Apartment C-5, and 6315 Fifth Avenue and Dennison Street, Apartment 305 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Because the police used the same affidavit of probable cause to support their applications for warrants to search Apartments C-2 and C-5 at the Rippey Street apartment complex, judicial economy is best served by disposing of Torres and Williams\u2019 appeals in conjunction with one another. However, Williams\u2019 appeal presents several distinct issues for this Court\u2019s consideration. Therefore, we will first consider the merits of Torres\u2019 appeal, and then address the issues presented by Williams\u2019 appeal.\nCommonwealth v. Torres\nAs noted above, Appellant Torres claims that the Superior Court erred in reversing the order of the suppression court granting his motion to suppress the evidence that the police seized from his apartment at the Rippey Street apartment complex. For the reasons that follow, we agree and therefore reverse.\nOn the evening of February 18, 1996, Timothy Moore, Joel Moore and Robert James were shot to death as they sat inside a parked Ford Bronco on the 1100 block of Sperling Street in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania. A police investigation into the murders ensued and three days later Detectives assigned to the Homicide Unit of the Allegheny County Police Department applied for a warrant to search Torres\u2019 Rippey Street apartment for firearms, ammunition, records of .crack cocaine sales, phone records, pagers and pager numbers, residency papers, crack cocaine and paraphernalia used to package and deliver crack cocaine. In support of their application for the issuance of a search warrant, the Detectives filed the following affidavit:\nYour affiants are Detectives assigned to the Homicide Unit of the Allegheny County Police Department. All of the information contained in this affidavit was learned directly by your affiants, or relayed to your affiants by other police officers involved in this investigation.\nOn the evening of February 18, 1996, the Wilkinsburg Police Department requested investigative assistance from the Allegheny County Police Homicide Unit. This request was in regards [sic] to a recent shooting incident that occurred in the 1100 block of Sperling Street in Wilkins-burg. It was subsequently learned that there were three (3) victims in this case, and all of the shooting victims were pronounced dead at the scene by Emergency Medical Personnel. The victims were all shot while seated in a parked 1982 Ford Bronco. The victims were Timothy A. MOORE, B/M725, Joel MOORE, B/M/19, and Robert JAMES, B/M/ 33. The investigation revealed that two armed suspects approached the victim\u2019s vehicle, and that the suspects then fired numerous gunshots into the victim\u2019s [sic].\nDuring the course of this investigation, it was learned that the three victims were involved in drug related activities. It was also learned that the victims had made a recent drug deal(s) with individuals known to frequent the Wilkins-burg/East Liberty Section of Allegheny County.\nNumerous interviews have been conducted in this case. The identity of these witnesses is known to your affiants. These witnesses will be available to testify at any necessary court proceedings. It was collectively learned through these witnesses that several days prior to the shooting incident, Timothy MOORE (victim), made a crack cocaine drug deal with individuals that he knew as \u201cBOB\u201d and \u201cMIKE\u201d. Bob and Alike previously indicated that they were brothers, and they were from New York. It was learned that the drug deals in question were set up through the use of telephone pagers. The telephone pager numbers for Bob and Mike were # 574-5647 and # 574-1745 respectively.\nIt was learned during the investigation that \u201cBob\u201d had a home telephone number of # 661-4862. This telephone number is listed to a David Michael TORRES of 5631 Rippey Street, Apt. C-2, Pittsburgh, PA 15206. This apartment is located in the East Liberty Section of Pittsburgh. The age of Torres is consistent with the approx, age of \u201cBob\u201d (as given by various witnesses).\nThe investigation revealed that on the evening in question, the victims agreed to meet with BOB and MIKE in Wilkinsburg to settle a drug related debt. It was reported that Tim MOORE had previously paid Bob and/or Mike approx. $2,300 for crack cocaine, but that Moore was not given any drugs in return for the money. The victims were to meet Bob and Mike at approx. 8:30 PM (2-18-96) in a parking lot of a Texaco Gas Station in Wilkinsburg. The purpose of the meeting was to resolve the dispute over the aforementioned crack cocaine deal. Witnesses indicated that the victim\u2019s [sic] departed from the New Stanton area of Westmoreland County for Wilkinsburg at approx. 8:00 PM. It should be noted that the planned meeting place for the drug deal was in close proximity to the shooting scene.\nDuring the investigation, your affiants learned through witnesses that the suspects, (BOB/MIKE) lived in the area of Rippey Street in the East Liberty Section of Pittsburgh. [I]t was also learned that Bob and Mike lived with a relative known as \u201cX\u201d. The investigation revealed that David MICHAEL TORRES resides at 5631 Rippey Street, Apt. C-2 and that two relatives lived at that same address. These relatives are Robert TORRES, AKA \u201cBOB\u201d Torres, and Xavier TORRES. Robert Torres lives in apartment # C-5, while Xavier resides in apartment B-3.\nDuring a recent surveillance of the apartment building in question, a vehicle was found to be parked in front of the structure. This vehicle had a New York license plates [sic] affixed to it. The description of this car was consistent with the description of the suspect car that was fleeing the shooting scene.\nBased on the above facts and circumstances, your affiants respectfully request a Search Warrant for the above listed residence.\nThe application and affidavit were signed by an issuing authority on February 21, 1996, and the police executed the warrant that same day. The police search of Torres\u2019 apartment produced two guns, an undetermined amount of U.S. currency, a box of cartridges, a television, two phones, two remote controls, paraphernalia and various papers bearing the names of Robert Torres and David Torres. Torres was subsequently arrested and charged with three counts of homicide. Torres\u2019 counsel filed an Omnibus Pre Trial Motion seeking, inter alia, suppression of the evidence seized from Torres\u2019 Rippey Street apartment. Following a hearing, the suppression court granted Torres\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence seized from his Rippey Street apartment, concluding that the affidavit filed in support of the application for the warrant was insufficient to establish probable cause for the search. The Commonwealth filed an interlocutory appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to Rule 311(d) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, and the Superior Court issued a published opinion and order reversing the suppression of the evidence. Commonwealth v. Torres, 714 A.2d 416 (Pa.Super.1998). Torres\u2019 instant appeal followed.\nIn reviewing the ruling of the suppression court, we note that the Superior Court was limited to determining whether the record supported that court\u2019s factual findings and whether the legal conclusions that the suppression court drew from those facts were correct. See Commonwealth v. E.M., 558 Pa. 16, 735 A.2d 654, 657 (1999) (citing Commonwealth v. Cortez, 507 Pa. 529, 532, 491 A.2d 111, 112 (1985)); Commonwealth v. Waltson, 555 Pa. 223, 724 A.2d 289, 291 (1998). In addition, the Superior Court was constrained to consider only the evidence presented by the defense and so much of the evidence for the prosecution which remained uncontradicted when read in the context of the record as a whole. Commonwealth v. Robinson, 518 Pa. 156, 541 A.2d 1387, 1389 (1988).\nIn his brief to this Court, Torres argues that the Superior Court ignored the above-cited standard of review, and failed to give proper deference to the suppression court\u2019s determination that the affidavit was insufficient to establish probable cause to search his apartment. More specifically, Torres argues that the Superior Court erred by determining that the police corroboration described in the affidavit imparted sufficient reliability to the information given by the anonymous sources to support a finding that the affidavit established probable cause to search under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), and later adopted by this Court for purposes of making and reviewing probable cause determinations under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania State Constitution in Commonwealth v. Gray, 509 Pa. 476, 503 A.2d 921 (1986). The Commonwealth counters by arguing that the Superior Court correctly found that the search warrant was properly issued. According to the Commonwealth, a common-sense reading of the affidavit indicates that some of the individuals who provided the police with information had personal knowledge of the association and conflict between the victims and Torres and that some of them actually observed the commission of the murders. In addition, the Commonwealth contends that the police were able to corroborate enough of the information that they received from their anonymous sources to support the issuing authority\u2019s determination that there was probable cause to believe that evidence connecting Torres to the murders would be found in his Rippey Street apartment.\nPursuant to the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Gates, the task of an issuing authority is \u201csimply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the \u2018veracity\u2019 and \u2018basis of knowledge\u2019 of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d Commonwealth v. Gray, 509 Pa. 476, 484, 503 A.2d 921, 925 (1986)(quoting Gates, 462 U.S. at 238-39, 103 S.Ct. at 2332). Thus, the totality of the circumstances test \u201cpermits a balanced assessment of the relative weights of all the various indicia of reliability (and unreliability) attending an informant\u2019s tip....\u201d Gates, 462 U.S. at 234, 103 S.Ct. at 2330. It is the duty of a court reviewing an issuing authority\u2019s probable cause determination to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. Gray, 509 Pa. at 484, 503 A.2d at 925. In so doing, the reviewing court must accord deference to the issuing authority\u2019s probable cause determination, and must view the information offered to establish probable cause in a common-sense, non-technical manner. Commonwealth v. Jones, 542 Pa. 418, 668 A.2d 114, 117 (1995) (opinion announcing the judgment of the Court).\nIn the instant case, the suppression court essentially concluded that the affidavit did not provide the issuing authority with a substantial basis to conclude that probable cause existed to search Torres\u2019 apartment for evidence linking him to the triple murder that occurred on February 18, 1996. In support of its decision to grant Torres\u2019 motion to suppress, the suppression court noted that the affidavit is frustratingly sparse, merely setting forth in narrative form what the affiants learned \"without providing any clear indication as to where they obtained each of the pieces of information included therein. The suppression court also noted that, based on the four corners of the affidavit, there was no way for the issuing authority to tell how the anonymous sources obtained their information. Accordingly, the suppression court found that the issuing authority had no substantial basis on which to assess the reliability of the information provided to the affiants. Finally, the suppression court found that the only corroboration which imparted any reliability to the information provided by the anonymous sources was the police observation of a vehicle matching a general description of the getaway car used in the shootings outside the apartment complex where Torres lived., At the suppression hearing, Detective Tallent, who spotted the vehicle, testified that the vehicle bore a New York State license plate, but also testified that he failed to investigate whether or not the vehicle was connected to Apartment C-2 until after the search of the apartments at the Rippey Street complex had taken place. The suppression court found that this bit of corroboration was insufficient to sustain the warrant in light of the lack of information concerning the basis of knowledge or veracity of the unnamed sources and the failure of the affidavit to ascribe each piece of information to one or several of the anonymous sources.\nIn reversing the suppression court, the Superior Court found that although the affidavit failed to expressly establish either the basis of knowledge or the veracity of the anonymous sources, the information that they provided to the police was sufficiently bolstered by the following indicia of reliability: (1) the detailed nature of the accounts offered by the anonymous source(s) of the victims\u2019 and their assailants\u2019 activities leading up to the murders; (2) the police verification of the address and phone number given for Torres; and (3) the police observation of a vehicle matching the description of the getaway vehicle used in the murders outside Torres\u2019 apartment complex. Commonwealth v. Torres, 714 A.2d 416, 420 (Pa.Super.1998). Thus, the Superior Court determined that the affidavit provided the issuing authority with a substantial basis to support his finding of probable cause to search. As the following discussion indicates, we find that the Superior Court gave too much weight to the indicia of reliability attending the information included in the affidavit and therefore erred in reversing the order of the suppression court.\nAs acknowledged by the Commonwealth, the affidavit does not expressly set forth the basis of knowledge of the anonymous sources. Nor do we find convincing the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that a \u201ccommon sense\u201d reading of the affidavit clearly indicates that one or more of the anonymous sources had personal knowledge of the events in question or was an actual eyewitness to the murders. Perhaps even more importantly, it is impossible to tell from the affidavit which of the anonymous source(s) provided each of the pieces of information included therein. Therefore, the mere fact that one or more of the anonymous sources provided a somewhat detailed account of the activities of the victims and their assailants preceding the murders does not, in and of itself, constitute a significant indicia of the reliability of that information. In addition, the fact that the police verified the address, phone number and general age given to them lor Torres \u2014 whose address and phone number were listed in the phone book and were therefore freely available to the public \u2014 does not constitute a significant indicia of the reliability of the other information provided to the police by the anonymous sources.\nFinally, as noted above, the affidavit mentions that the police observed a vehicle parked outside Torres\u2019 apartment complex which met the description of a vehicle seen fleeing the scene of the murders. This piece of corroboration does little to establish the reliability of the information provided by the anonymous sources due to the fact that: (1) the affidavit does not set forth the description of the fleeing vehicle that was given to the police or how the vehicle that was later observed outside Torres\u2019 apartment complex matched that description; (2) there is no clear indication in the affidavit as to how the police got a description of the fleeing vehicle in the first place; and (3) although the affidavit explains that the vehicle spotted outside Torres\u2019 apartment complex had a New York State license plate (which matched up with the information that the police had received that Torres and Williams had indicated that they were brothers from New York), there is no indication in the affidavit as to whether the police wrote down the license plate number or made any efforts to determine whether the plate could be linked somehow to Torres and/or Williams.\nAlthough the basis of knowledge and veracity of anonymous sources are only factors to be considered by the issuing authority in making probable cause determinations, they retain a vital role in cases such as the instant one, where the affidavit of probable cause is almost entirely based on information gleaned from anonymous sources. Where, as here, there is no attempt made to establish either the basis of knowledge of the anonymous sources or their general veracity, a strong showing of the reliability of the information that they have relayed to the police in the specific case is required in order to support a finding of probable cause. Such a showing is simply not made by the affidavit of probable cause in the instant case.\nWe are well aware of the fact that, as a reviewing court, we are not to conduct a de novo review of the issuing authority\u2019s probable cause determination, but are simply to determine whether or not there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the decision to issue the warrant. See, e.g., Massachusetts v. Upton, 466 U.S. 727, 728, 104 S.Ct. 2085, 80 L.Ed.2d 721 (1984) (citing Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983)). However, even given the substantial deference which we must afford the issuing authority\u2019s probable cause determination, we must find that after considering all of the information included in the affidavit and balancing the relative weights of the indicia of reliability (and unreliability) attending that information, the affidavit of probable cause failed to provide a substantial basis upon which to issue a warrant to search Torres\u2019 Rippey Street apartment. Therefore, since there is no \u201cgood faith exception\u201d to the exclusionary rule in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the suppression court properly granted Torres\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence seized from his Rippey Street apartment and the Superior Court erred in reversing it. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Superior Court reversing the suppression court\u2019s order granting Torres\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence seized from Apartment C-2 at the Rippey Street apartment complex and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nCommonwealth v. Williams\nAs noted above, Williams\u2019 appeal presents several distinct issues requiring this Court\u2019s consideration. Accordingly, our disposition of Torres\u2019 appeal does not necessarily control our disposition of Williams\u2019 appeal, despite the fact that a practically identical affidavit of probable cause was used to obtain the warrants to search Apartments C-2 and C-5 at the Rippey Street apartment complex. First, Williams\u2019 appeal requires this Court to consider the propriety of the Superior Court\u2019s decision reversing the suppression of the evidence found at Apartment C-5 at the Rippey Street Apartment Complex. In addition, Williams\u2019 appeal raises a question concerning the propriety of the Superior Court\u2019s decision reversing the suppression of the evidence seized from his residence at Apartment 305 at 6315 Fifth Avenue and Dennison Street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court concerning both searches.\nUpon executing the warrant to search Apartment C-5 at the Rippey Street apartment complex, the police found a bag of suspected crack cocaine, a scale, plastic bags, scissors, two bags of suspected marijuana, a brown bottle containing an unknown liquid, two bundles of money totaling $2,702.00 in U.S. currency, a broken cellular phone and opened and unopened mail addressed to Williams. Following the searches of the Rippey Street apartments, the police applied for and obtained a warrant to search Williams\u2019 residence at 6315 Fifth Avenue and Dennison Street, Apartment 305. Upon executing the warrant, the police found tax records, personal telephone books, prison records, a digital scale, two pagers and numerous plastic bags. Williams was subsequently arrested and charged with three counts of homicide. Williams\u2019 counsel filed an Omnibus Pre-Trial Motion seeking, inter alia, suppression of the evidence seized from Apartment C-5 at the Rippey Street apartment complex and Apartment 305 at 6315 Fifth Avenue and Dennison Street. Following a hearing, the suppression court granted Williams\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence seized from both Apartment C-5 and Apartment 305, concluding that the affidavits filed in support of the applications for the warrants to search the apartments were insufficient to establish probable cause. The Commonwealth subsequently filed an interlocutory appeal to the Superior Court pursuant to Rule 311(d) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, and the Superior Court reversed the order of the suppression court by order and memorandum opinion dated June 12,1998. Williams\u2019 instant appeal followed.\nOn appeal to the Superior Court, the Commonwealth argued that the suppression court erred in finding that Williams had standing to contest the validity of the Rippey Street apartment complex. In the alternative, the Commonwealth argued that the affidavit provided the issuing authority with a substantial basis to conclude warrant to search Apartment C-5 at the that there was probable cause to search the apartment. Although the Superior Court disagreed with the Commonwealth\u2019s standing argument, it agreed, in accordance with its prior decision in the companion case of Commonwealth v. Torres, 714 A.2d 416 (Pa.Super.1998), that the affidavit established probable cause for the search. Therefore, the Superior Court reversed the order of the suppression court. In accordance with our above disposition of Torres\u2019 appeal, we agree with Williams\u2019 contention that the Superior Court erred in concluding that the affidavit supplied the issuing authority with a substantial basis to conclude that there was probable cause to search Apartment C-5. However, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court on an alternative basis-that Williams has failed to demonstrate a subjective expectation of privacy in the premises searched. See, e.g., E.J. McAleer & Co. v. Iceland Products, Inc., 475 Pa. 610, 613 n. 4, 381 A.2d 441, 443 n. 4 (1977) (noting that this Court may affirm a lower court\u2019s decision on any basis, regardless of the specific basis on which the lower court relied).\nThe lower courts concluded that Williams had standing to contest the validity of the warrant to search Apartment C-5 at the Rippey Street apartment complex because he testified at the pre-trial motions hearing that his name was on the lease for the apartment as of the date of the search. The lower courts\u2019 legal conclusion in this regard is proper under Pennsylvania law, as the traditional formulation for standing to contest a search based on an alleged violation of privacy rights under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution is satisfied when a defendant demonstrates that he has a proprietary or possessory interest in the premises searched. Commonwealth v. Peterkin, 511 Pa. 299, 309, 513 A.2d 373, 378 (1986). However, having standing based on a proprietary or possessory interest in the premises searched merely entitles a defendant to an adjudication of the merits of his/her suppression motion. Commonwealth v. Peterson, 535 Pa. 492, 497-98, 636 A.2d 615, 617-18 (1993). In order to actually prevail on such a motion, the defendant must also separately demonstrate that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in the premises at the time of the search and that such an expectation is objectively reasonable, i.e., that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy. Id. at 498, 636 A.2d at 618. In the instant case, the lower courts failed to recognize the legal significance of the fact that Williams, by his own testimony at the pre-trial motions hearing, expressly disavowed having had any subjective expectation of privacy in Apartment C-5 on the date of the search. Williams testified in relevant part as follows at the pre-trial motions hearing during cross-examination:\nQ: Did you control an apartment on Rippey Street?\nA: No, I did not. I lived on Rippey Street \u2014 you said Rippey. That is one apartment.\nQ: The Rippey Gardens.\nA: There is one apartment I used to have. That was a long time ago. That is not an updated apartment that I had. I moved to Dennison. That was prior to that. I did not have control over another apartment. I only had one apartment.\nQ: You didn\u2019t have control over the apartment at Rippey Street, is that what you are telling us?\nA: I don\u2019t own an apartment on Rippey Street.\nQ: Excuse me?\nA: I don\u2019t own that apartment at Rippey Street. At one point in time, but that was six months prior.\nQ: You were still the leaseholder of that apartment, were you not?\nA: It was a co-lease.\nQ: So you were a co-leaseholder of that apartment on the day of this murder, is that right?\nA: I did not own the apartment. I did not live there. Someone else lived there.\nQ: Your name was on a lease though, is that correct?\nA: Yes, it is because it has to be signed over. It was signed over to another person.\n(Pre-trial Motions Hrg. N.T., 9/17/97, at 41-42.)\nGiven this testimony, it is clear that Williams had no subjective expectation of privacy in Apartment C-5 on the date of the search. As noted above, a subjective expectation of privacy in a place or thing, while not a necessary prerequisite for standing to contest a search or seizure under Article I, Section 8 jurisprudence, is essential to a finding of a constitutionally protected, legitimate expectation of privacy. See, e.g., Hawkins, 718 A.2d at 267-68. Therefore, having failed to establish that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in the premises as of the date of the search, Williams could not properly prevail on the claim presented in his motion to suppress (which was namely that the police search of Apartment C-5 at the Rippey Street apartment complex violated his right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures under Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania State Constitution and/or the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States of America). Thus, albeit on a different basis, we affirm the decision of the Superior Court reversing the suppression of the evidence seized from Apartment C-5.\nWilliams also claims in his appeal to this Court that the Superior Court erred in reversing the suppression of the evidence seized from his residence 6315 Fifth Avenue and Dennison Street, Apartment 305. For the reasons that follow, we find that Williams\u2019 claim of error is without merit and therefore affirm.\nThe affidavit of probable cause filed in support of the application for a warrant to search Williams\u2019 Dennison Street apartment provided as follows:\nOn 2-18-96 three men were shot and killed in Wilkinsburg Pa. The investigation led to a residence at 5631 Rippey St. Pgh. Pa. 15206. A search of three apartments led to discovery of crack cocaine, and firearms and ammunition. One of the weapons matched the bullets removed from the body of the victim (Timothy Moore). One Bobby Torres AKA Elijah \u201cBobby\u201d Williams was identified as one of the suspects in this case and a[sic] arrest warrant was obtained. On 2-24-96 a call was received from a parole officer stating that Bobby Torres was living at 6315 Fifth Ave. & Dennison St\u2019s in Pgh. Pa. The agent stated that he had been to an apartment at that address and this was the apartment that Torres/Williams informed state parole that he was living in. The agent stated that as of three days ago (Wed.2-22-96) he had interviewed Williams at apartment 305 at the aforementioned address. County and City police went to the residence this date and varified [sic] that Torres/Williams was living at this address with a b/f named Carol Johnson. The suspect and Johnson have resided at this address since 9-1-95. A search warrant is being requested to search the apartment for the above noted items. It is believed that information related to this crime and to the location of others involved may be found in this residence. Since the apart, at Rippey St. was being rented by Bobby Torres/Williams and others associated with him and there was crack and firearms found at that residence it is the belief of your affiants that this is another residence used for drug related activity.\nAn issuing authority signed the warrant on February 24, 1996, and the police executed it that same day, seizing assorted photographs, papers, letters and tax records, personal telephone books, probation and prison records, a digital scale, personal pagers for Williams, additional telephone pagers, a canister of pepper mace and numerous plastic bags from Williams\u2019 Dennison Street apartment.\nIn granting Williams\u2019 pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence seized from his Dennison Street apartment, the suppression court found that the affidavit filed in support of the application for the warrant failed to provide the issuing authority with a substantial basis to find that there was probable cause to search. In support of its determination, the suppression court noted that the affidavit contains \u201cgeneral information and essentially authorizes a fishing expedition.\u201d Furthermore, the suppression court found that the affidavit provided an insufficient basis for the issuing authority to conclude that the items sought would be found at the place to be searched. On appeal, the Superior Court reversed, concluding that, based on the totality of the circumstances, the affidavit provided the issuing authority with a substantial basis to find that there was probable cause to believe that evidence tending to link Williams to the triple murder and/or illegal drug-related activity would be found at his Dennison Street apartment.\nWhile Williams contends on appeal to this Court that the Superior Court erred in reversing the suppression of the evidence found in his Dennison Street apartment, he does not attempt to echo the reasoning of the suppression court in doing so. Instead, Williams argues that if this Court finds that the Superior Court erred in reversing the suppression of the evidence seized from Apartment C-5 at the Rippey Street complex, then, pursuant to the fruit of the poisonous tree doctrine, any references to that evidence in the affidavit of probable cause to search his Dennison Street apartment would also have to be stricken. Without such references, Williams argues that the redacted affidavit would no longer establish probable cause to search his Dennison Street apartment.\nWilliams\u2019 argument is certainly creative. Nevertheless, it is entirely unavailing, as this Court has found that the Superior Court did not err in reversing the suppression of the evidence seized from Apartment C-5 at the Rippey Street Apartment complex. Since Williams\u2019 only argument is that the affidavit would be insufficient to establish probable cause if the information obtained from the search of Apartment C-5 at the Rippey Street apartment complex were to be stricken from it, his claim that the Superior Court erred in reversing the suppression of the evidence seized from his Dennison Street apartment must necessarily fail. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court reversing the order of the suppression court.\nJustice CASTILLE and Justice NEWMAN file a concurring and dissenting opinions.\n. Appellants were arrested and charged in connection with a triple homicide in 1996. Although they were initially to be tried jointly, their trials were subsequently severed.\n. Rule 311(d) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure permits the Commonwealth in criminal cases to file interlocutory appeals as of right, so long as it certifies in its notice of appeal that the order being appealed from will either terminate or substantially handicap the prosecution. Pa.R.A.P. 311(d).\n. Although the affiants stated in the affidavit of probable cause that they knew the identities of the individuals who provided them with information and that they (i.e., the unnamed tipsters/informants) would be available to testify at any necessary court proceedings, the lower courts properly considered the tipsters/informants to he anonymous sources, since none of them were named, there was no indication that any of them had previously provided information to the police and no reason was given for the failure to divulge their names.\n. Detective Tallent of the Allegheny County Police Department (who was one of the affiants in the affidavit of probable cause for the search warrant) testified at the suppression hearing that two eyewitnesses described the getaway vehicle used in the murders to the police as a dark colored, four-door vehicle. One of those two witnesses also described the vehicle as mid-sized and possibly black in color. (N.T., 5/5/97, at 42-45.) Detective Tallent further testified that during a subsequent surveillance of the Rippey Street apartment complex, he observed a vehicle with a New York license plate matching the general description of the getaway vehicle given by the eyewitnesses. Detective Tallent explained that he failed to make an effort to detain the vehicle despite his suspicion that it might have been used in the murders because the police surveillance was not specifically for the vehicle, and because limited manpower was deployed to watch the apartment complex. (N.T., 5/5/97, at 45-49 .) However, Detective Tallent did write down the license plate number of the vehicle. (N.T., 5/5/97, at 50.)\n. Although the affidavit also indicates that the police verified a phone number, address and general age given for Torres by one or more of the anonymous sources, the suppression court refused to consider this corroboration as tending to establish either the veracity of the anonymous sources or the reliability of the information that they provided to the police, since mere knowledge of Torres\u2019 listed phone number, address and approximate age does not tend to demonstrate a special familiarity with his personal affairs. See generally In the Interest of O.A., 552 Pa. 666, 717 A.2d 490, 498 (1998) (plurality opinion) (noting that police corroboration of aspects of a tip which demonstrate a special familiarity with the defendant\u2019s affairs impart an indicia of reliability to the tip).\n. The police were subsequently unable to connect the vehicle that they observed to Torres\u2019 apartment at the Rippey Street complex. (N.T., 5/5/97, at 50.)\n. We also note that the information provided by the anonymous sources in the instant case is unlike the information provided to the police in Gates in one critical respect. In Gates, the police were provided with an anonymous note which contained not only a detailed account of the defendants' personal activities in furtherance of their criminal enterprise, but also a prediction of the defendants\u2019 future activities relating to their criminal enterprise, which the police independently verified the general accuracy of before seeking the issuance of a search warrant. Gates, 462 U.S. at 245-46, 103 S.Ct. 2317. In contrast, the anonymous source(s) cited in the affidavit of probable cause in the instant case offered only a retrospective account of the events leading up to and including the murders, along with the names of and other general information concerning the individuals allegedly involved in the murders.\n. While the reliability of information provided by anonymous sources can be established through independent police corroboration, the limited corroboration of general information described in the affidavit of probable cause in the instant case is insufficient to sustain the warrant.\n. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Edmunds, 526 Pa. 374, 376, 399, 586 A.2d 887, 888, 899 (1991) (concluding that a \u201cgood faith\" exception to the exclusionary rule in the stale of Pennsylvania would frustrate the privacy guarantees embodied in Article I, Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution).\n. It should be noted that the \"standing doctrine\u201d is no longer relevant to suppression claims based on a violation of the Fourth Amendment to the federal Constitution. See, e.g., Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83, 87-88, 119 S.Ct. 469, 142 L.Ed.2d 373 (1998). However, the United States Supreme Court has also made it clear that a defendant must establish a legitimate expectation of privacy in the premises searched or the item(s) seized in order to be entitled to challenge the search or seizure based on a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Id.\n. A legitimate expectation of privacy requires \u201ca subjective privacy expectation coupled with objective reasonableness.\u201d Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 553 Pa. 76, 718 A.2d 265, 267, n. 1 (1998) (citing Commonwealth v. Brundidge, 533 Pa. 167, 173, 620 A.2d 1115, 1118 (1993)).\n. Williams argues that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in Apartment C-5 because he, as a co-lessee, had the right to exclude others from entering or remaining inside tire apartment. (Appellant\u2019s Brief at 17-18.) His argument is misplaced, however, as it does nothing to address his failure to establish a subjective expectation of privacy in the premises as of the date of the search.\n. In effect, Williams concedes that the success of his appeal from the Superior Court's reversal of the suppression of the evidence seized from his Dennison Street apartment is dependent on the success of his appeal from the Superior Court's reversal of the suppression of the evidence seized from Apartment C-5 at the Rippey Street complex. That being the case, Williams emphasizes that the affidavit of probable cause to search his Dennison Street apartment was based in large part on the evidence that the police previously seized from Apartment C-5 at the Rippey Street complex."}
