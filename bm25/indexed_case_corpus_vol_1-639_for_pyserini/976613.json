{"id": "976613", "contents": "Per Curiam :\nNo appeal lies from the Quarter Sessions in desertion cases. This case comes up by writ of certiorari, and we can only examine the regularity of the proceedings. We learn from the record that the plaintiff was charged with desertion upon the oath of his wife; was convicted thereof by the court below, and an appropriate sentence imposed. All this was regular, and we cannot review the case upon its merits.\nJudgment affirmed."}
