{"id": "1099637", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Frazer,\nThe County Commissioners of Luzerne County presented their petition to the court of quarter sessions, for approval of the erection of a new bridge over the Susquehanna River, between the City of Wilkes-Barre and the Borough of Kingston, in place of one now in use, known as the North Street Bridge, in which it was averred that \u201cthe present bridge and its approaches, including the pond-hole bridges, are inadequate and there is urgent, pressing and great need for a new bridge and approaches over said river and for an improved highway free from overflow at high water periods.\u201d After hearing, the court directed, \u201cwithout approving or disapproving at this time, that the same be laid before the grand jury, for action precedent to any further action of approval or disapproval by the court.\u201d Subsequently the grand jury, \u201cafter full hearing, investigation and consideration as well as deliberation,\u201d approved \u201cthe petition with accompanying plans, drawings and specifications.\u201d Thereupon the court struck from the report as surplusage, the jury\u2019s approval of the plans as being beyond its proper function and contrary to instructions, but allowed the report to stand \u201csolely as the grand jury\u2019s approval of replacement with a new bridge,\u201d withholding, however, the court\u2019s \u201capproval of such replacement at this time, being of opinion that, in order to relieve present traffic congestion with the greatest possible despatch, repair of the present structure should precede replacement, accompanied by proceedings to construct a third bridge.\u201d An appeal was taken by the commissioners from this order to the Superior Court, which court affirmed the order of the court below (88 Pa. Superior Ct. 209). In so doing we think error was committed.\nThe Act of February 14, 1907, P. L. 3, the statute under which these proceedings were had, authorizes county commissioners to construct new and sufficient bridges to take the place of those then existing, which for any cause become inadequate to accommodate public travel, if their action shall first have the approval of the court of quarter sessions and the grand jury of the proper county. Here we have the petition of the commissioners to the effect that the present North Street Bridge is inadequate and should be replaced by a new and larger structure and an approval by the grand jury, but neither approval nor disapproval of the petition by the court of quarter sessions. In place of such final action by the court, the record discloses the withholding of its approval \u201cat this time,\u201d of the commissioners\u2019 conclusion that the bridge be replaced with a new structure and a suggestion by the court that repair of the present bridge be made. This order is neither an approval nor disapproval of the proposed action of the commissioners as the Act of 1907 requires on the part of the court, consequently not a final order from which an appeal lies. It therefore follows that the appeal to the Superior Court was premature and should have been quashed by that tribunal.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed, the appeal of the county commissioners quashed and the record remitted to the court of quarter sessions for a final order, either approving or disapproving of the petition. Costs to be paid by County of Luzerne."}
