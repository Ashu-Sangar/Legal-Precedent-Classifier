{"id": "12279974", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice DONOHUE.\nIn this appeal, we are asked to determine whether freight brokerage services are excepted from local business privilege taxation under the \u201cpublic utility\u201d exception found in Section 301.1(f)(2) of the Local Tax Enabling Act (\u201cLTEA\u201d), Act of December 31, 1965, P.L. 1257, as amended, 53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.301.1(f)(2). The Commonwealth Court concluded that S&H was not excepted. We affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision because we conclude that the rates of the common motor carriers with whom S&H does business are not fixed and regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (\u201cPUC\u201d), and thus the entire exception is inapplicable.\nThe facts are not in dispute. S & H is an intrastate, interstate and international freight broker headquartered in the City. S & H receives freight shipment orders from manufacturing customers and then negotiates contracts for carriage with licensed common carriers which are public utilities and regulated by the PUC. According to S & H\u2019s controller, it is the middleman between the customer and the carriers. S & H invoices its customers for payment. The payment includes the charges it negotiates with the carrier for the utility service (cost of shipment) together with taxes and fees. S & H then remits payment to the common carrier and retains the freight brokerage commission. Because it collects the entire balance, S & H\u2019s records include the gross receipts from freight shipment transactions before payment is made to the carriers. As a result, the gross receipts do not include deductions for the shipment costs. See Stipulation of Uncontested Facts, 12/10/13, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4 6-7.\nSection 301.1 of the LTEA, 53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.301.1(a.l)(l), authorizes political subdivisions to levy a tax on the privilege of doing business in the jurisdiction of the local taxing authority. Section 301.1(f) of the LTEA, however, prohibits local authorities from collecting or levying any taxes on certain types of goods and transactions enumerated in sixteen subsections. The \u201cpublic utility\u201d exception, at issue here, is found in Section 301.1(f)(2) of the LTEA:\n(f) Such local authorities shall not have authority by virtue of this act:\n(2) To levy, assess or collect a tax on the gross receipts from utility services of any person or company whose rates and service are fixed and regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission or on any public utility services rendered by any such person or company or on any privilege or transaction involving the rendering of any such public utility service.\n53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.301.1(f)(2).\nFor the years 2007 through 2011, S & H filed business privilege tax returns with the City. S & H paid the annual $25 Business Privilege and Mercantile License fees. S & H did not report any income to the City for business privilege tax purposes for those years, however, because it believed it fell within the \u201cpublic utility\u201d exception in Section 301.1(f)(2) of the LTEA.\nIn November 2011, the City conducted an audit of S & H\u2019s business privilege tax returns. The City assessed a business privilege tax on S & H\u2019s gross receipts in the amount of $118,346.88 for the years 2007-2011. S & H appealed and the tax-assessment appeal hearing officer upheld the City\u2019s assessment following a hearing.\nS & H appealed to the trial court, arguing that pursuant to Section 301.1(f)(2) of the LTEA, the City was not authorized to assess or collect the business privilege tax. S & H argued, and the City agreed, that Section 301.1(f)(2) of the LTEA contains three clauses, each of which creates a distinct exception. S & H claimed that it fell within the third clause because it derives its gross receipts from transactions that involve the rendering of a public utility service, namely the interstate and intrastate shipment of goods by licensed common carriers regulated by the PUC. S & H asserted that it participates in, or is \u201cinvolved\u201d in, the \u201crendering\u201d of the public utility services provided by common carriers because it negotiates the carrier\u2019s charges, it collects from the shipper the carrier\u2019s charges, it transmits the charges to the carrier, and the amount S & H invoices its customer includes the actual charge for the services being provided by the carrier. S & H also emphasized that it pays taxes on freight shipments and is regulated by the PUC through its registrations with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) and the Unified Carrier Registration (UCR). The City conversely emphasized that S & H acts only as the \u201cmiddleman\u201d between shippers and the carriers and is neither a common carrier nor a public utility. According to the City, the common carrier itself, rather than the freight broker, is the party directly \u201cinvolved\u201d in the \u201crendering\u201d of the public utility service.\nAfter a non-jury trial, the trial court concluded that it was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d that S & H\u2019s gross receipts were \u201ctax exempt\u201d under the third clause of Section 301.1(f)(2) of the LTEA. Trial Court Opinion, 2/27/14, at 4. According to the trial court, S & H \u201ccollected gross receipts on transactions involving the rendering of any such public utility service\u201d since the property carriers S & H used to transport freight are public utilities. Id.\nIn a published decision authored by President Judge Pelle-grini and joined by Judge Leadbetter, the Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court\u2019s order and remanded for further proceedings. The majority initially noted that Section 301.1(f)(2) of the LTEA \u201cgenerally prevents local governments from taxing subjects involved in the rendering of public utility services.\u201d S & H Transport, Inc. v. City of York, 102 A.3d 599, 601 (Pa.Cmwlth.2014). It found that the first clause\u2014 \u201c[t]o levy, assess or collect a tax on the gross receipts from utility service of any person or company whose rates and services are fixed and regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission\u201d \u2014 prohibits a tax on the utility as measured by gross receipts. Id. at 601. The second clause \u2014 \u201con any public utility services rendered by any such person or company\u201d \u2014 prohibits a local government from imposing a tax on the customer, as measured by the amount billed to the customer for the services. Id. Finally, with respect to the third clause, \u2014 \u201cany privilege or transaction involving the rendering of any such public utility service\u201d \u2014 the majority viewed the issue as \u201cwhether this clause applies only to prohibit levying a business tax on the public utility for the privilege of engaging in public utility services or whether it extends to all parties that engage in the business of buying public utility services.\u201d Id. at 601-02.\nAddressing that question, the majority observed that the entity \u201crendering\u201d the public utility service is the one that transmits, delivers or furnishes transportation of property, which the majority described as the \u201challmark\u201d of public utility service as a common carrier. Id. at 602-03. S&H negotiates a price to facilitate the transportation of the shippers\u2019 goods to provide better rates, but does not itself transmit, deliver or furnish transportation of any property. Id. As a result, affording the words \u201cinvolve\u201d and \u201crender\u201d their plain and ordinary meaning, the majority concluded that S&H was not \u201cinvolved\u201d in the \u201crendering\u201d of \u201cany public utility service.\u201d Id. Judge Leadbetter joined President Judge Pellegri-ni\u2019s opinion, but wrote separately to explain that because the rates of the common carriers contracted by S & H are not \u201cfixed and regulated\u201d by the PUC, S & H does not qualify for an exception under the third clause of Section 301.1(f)(2), as the reference in that clause to \u201csuch public utility service\u201d refers to the public utility services described in the first clause of that provision. Id. at 603 (Leadbetter, J., concurring).\nJudge Simpson dissented, indicating that \u201cthe words \u2018shall not have authority\u2019 have been construed to be a limitation on the power to tax so that doubts relating to their construction are resolved in favor of the taxpayers.\u201d Id. at 604 (Simpson, J., dissenting) (quoting Golden Triangle Broad., Inc. v. City of Pittsburgh, 31 Pa.Cmwlth. 547, 377 A.2d 839, 842 (1977) (en banc), aff'd, 483 Pa. 525, 397 A.2d 1147 (1979)). Judge Simpson insisted that the majority\u2019s construction of the word \u201cinvolved\u201d in the third clause was too narrow, and that S&H, whose revenues were derived solely from freight delivery by carriers regulated by the PUC, was thus \u201cinvolved\u201d in the \u201crendering\u201d of public utility services. Id. at 604-605. (Simpson, J., dissenting). Finally, Judge Simpson disagreed with Judge Leadbetter\u2019s contention that the reference to \u201csuch public utility service\u201d in the third clause refers to the public utility services described in the first clause. Instead, Judge Simpson would have applied the last antecedent rule, pursuant to which \u201ccourts should generally apply qualifying words to the words immediately preceding them, not to other words, phrases or clauses more remote.\u201d Id. at 605 n. 2 (Simpson, J., dissenting) (quoting 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1903(b); Commonwealth v. Packer, 568 Pa. 481, 798 A.2d 192 (2002)). Applying the last antecedent rule, Judge Simpson would have found that the term \u201csuch\u201d in the third clause refers to the phrase \u201cany public utility service\u201d in the second clause, \u201cnot to remote language in the first clause.\u201d S & H Transport, 102 A.3d at 605, n. 2 (Simpson, J., dissenting).\nIn a footnote, the majority disagreed with Judge Simpson\u2019s focus on the word \u201cinvolved,\u201d reasoning that if this interpretation was accepted, \u201call truck stops could not be taxed because they are \u2018involved\u2019 in public utility services because they supply the tracks with gas.\u201d Id. at 603 n. 10. The majority further reasoned that because brokers are specifically excluded from the definition of a \u201ccommon carrier\u201d in the PUC Code, 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102, S & H is, \u201cby definition, not so involved.\u201d S & H Transport, 102 A.3d at 603 n. 10. The majority also rejected Judge Simpson\u2019s position that the term \u201csuch\u201d in the third clause refers to the \u201cservices\u201d in the second clause. Id. (\u201c[Bjeeause the PUC no longer regulates \u2018the rates and services\u2019 of trucking companies ... if [Judge Simpson\u2019s] interpretation is adopted, that would lead to the anomalous result that freight brokers would not be subject to the tax but tracking companies would be.\u201d).\nThis Court granted allocatur to consider the following issues presented by S & H:\n(1) Whether the City [of York] may include, in its tax assessment on [S & H], gross receipts from freight-brokerage services provided to entities engaged in public utility services that are [excepted] from the City\u2019s Business Privilege Tax because those entities are regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission?\n(2) Whether entities whose rates were once, but are no longer, regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission still enjoy the [exception] from Municipal taxation articulated in 53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.301.1(f)(2)?\n5 & H Tramp., Inc. v. City of York, 631 Pa. 293, 111 A.3d 169 (2015) (per curiam).\nS & H argues that the Commonwealth Court incorrectly determined that S & H was not \u201cinvolved\u201d in the \u201crendering\u201d of \u201cpublic utility\u201d services. Initially, S & H claims that in the intermediate court, neither party raised, argued or briefed the question of whether S & H was \u201cinvolved\u201d in the \u201crendering\u201d of \u201cpublic utility\u201d service. It contends that, to the contrary, the parties tacitly agreed that S & H was involved in the rendering of non-rate regulated common carrier services, S 6 H claims that since \u201cpublic utility\u201d is not defined in the LTEA, the exception from local taxation in the LTEA must be read in pari materia with the policy objectives expressed in the provisions of the PUC Code. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1932. Reading Section 301.1(f)(2) in pari materia with Section 2501(a) of the PUC Code, S & H contends that freight brokers are unquestionably \u201cinvolved\u201d in the \u201crendering\u201d of public utility services.\nNext, S & H urges that the \u201cpublic utility\u201d exception in Section 301.1(f)(2) is not limited to rate-regulated public utilities. Embracing Judge Simpson\u2019s application of the last antecedent rule, S & H submits that the term \u201csuch\u201d in the third clause refers to the phrase \u201cany public utility service\u201d in the second clause. Accordingly, S & H\u2019s preferred interpretation of Section 301.1(f)(2) would provide an exception from local taxation in three circumstances: where gross receipts are derived from a utility service whose rates of service are fixed and regulated by the PUC; where gross receipts are derived from any public utility service rendered; or where gross receipts are derived from any privilege or transaction involving the rendering of any public utility service.\nIn response, the City supports the Commonwealth Court\u2019s focus on the words \u201cinvolved,\u201d \u201crender\u201d and \u201cpublic utility\u201d as restricting the scope of the exception in the third clause of Section 301.1(f)(2). The City asserts that the Commonwealth Court correctly concluded that the entity that renders the public utility service is the one that transports the goods, and that because S & H does not participate in the actual transportation of goods, it is not involved in the rendering of public utility service. Finally, the City insists that even if S & H is involved in the rendering of a public utility service, S & H still does not qualify for the \u201cpublic utility\u201d exception under the second or third clauses because the rates it negotiates and charges its customers are not fixed and regulated by the PUC. Under the City\u2019s preferred interpretation of the Section 301.1(f)(2) exception, an entity must be a public utility whose rates are fixed and regulated by the PUC.\nAs this case presents issues of statutory interpretation, they are questions of law over which our review is plenary and de novo. Fish v. Township of Lower Merion, 633 Pa. 705, 128 A.3d 764, 769 (2015). The Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1501-1991, makes clear that the \u201cpolestar\u201d of construction is determining the intent of the legislature. Griffiths v. W.C.A.B. (Seven Stars Farm, Inc.), 596 Pa. 317, 943 A.2d 242, 254 (2008); 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a). When the language of the statute is clear, that language is dispositive of legislative intent and thus vitiates the need for further interpretation. See 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(b). Statutes or parts of statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same persons or things or to the same class of persons or things. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1932(a). In construing the language within a statute, we must give effect to every word of the statute. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1922(2); American Airlines, Inc. v. Commonwealth, Board of Finance and Review, 542 Pa. 1, 665 A.2d 417 (1995); see generally Commonwealth v. Ostrosky, 589 Pa. 437, 909 A.2d 1224, 1232 (2006) (citing Holland v. Marcy, 584 Pa. 195, 883 A.2d 449, 456 (2005) (plurality) (\u201c[W]e cannot assume that the legislature intended any words to be mere surplus-age.\u201d)).\nThis case involves the interpretation of a statutory exception from local taxation for public utilities found in Section 301.1(f)(2) of the LTEA which, as noted above, provides as follows:\n(f) Such local authorities shall not have authority by virtue of this Act:\n(2) To levy, assess or collect a tax on the gross receipts from utility services of any person or company whose rates and service are fixed and regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission or on any public utility services rendered by any such person or company or on any privilege or transaction involving the rendering of any such public utility service.\n53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.301.1(f)(2).\nAs developed, S & H is claiming the exception as a freight broker that negotiates contracts for carriage with licensed common carriers. These carriers are regulated by the PUC and defined as public utilities under the PUC Code. Common carriers are regulated under the PUC Code in varying degrees. Broadly speaking for the purpose of our analysis, there are two categories of common carriers: those whose rates are regulated by the PUC and those whose rates are not regulated by the PUC.\nPassenger carriers (with a seating capacity of fifteen or more) and carriers of household goods in use (moving companies), both of which deal directly with the consuming public, are regulated regarding rates, geographical area, customer service, safety and insurance. Passenger carriers and household goods carriers must file a tariff specifying their applicable rates and charges, and must seek PUC approval for any change in rates. 52 Pa.Code \u00a7 3.381(e). On the other hand, common carriers of property (trucking companies) are regulated for safety and insurance requirements only. Property carriers are not required to file a tariff and thus, their rates are not fixed and regulated by the PUC. See 52 Pa.Code \u00a7 23.1(b) (\u201cThis Chapter [relating to Tariffs of Common Carriers] applies to motor carriers except common carriers of property.\u201d).\nThe parties to this action agree that the common motor carriers for which S & H provides freight brokerage services are property carriers, i.e., shippers of manufactured goods and property other than household goods. As such, they are common carriers that are non-rate regulated public utilities. While their service is regulated by the PUC, their rates are not fixed and regulated.\nTurning to interpretation of the statute, we find that Section 301.1(f)(2) is clear and unambiguous. Excepted from local taxation under the first clause are: \u201cgross receipts from utility service of any person or company whose rates and services are fixed and regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.301.1(f)(2). To fall within the ambit of the first clause of Section 301.1(f)(2), the person or company\u2019s rates and services must be fixed and regulated by the PUC. The common motor carriers with whom S & H does business (property carriers) do not fall within the scope of the first clause of Section 301.1.(f)(2) because their rates are not fixed and regulated by the PUC. The City is not barred from imposing local business privilege taxes on them.\nThe second clause provides an exception from local taxation on \u201cservices rendered by any such person or company.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). It is clear to this Court that the phrase \u201cany such person or company\u201d refers back to the person or company \u201cwhose rates and services are fixed and regulated\u201d by the PUC in the first clause. The use of the word \u201csuch\u201d in the second clause requires the reference back to the first clause, where \u201csuch person or company\u201d is described. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. McClintic, 589 Pa. 465, 909 A.2d 1241, 1250 (2006) (the word \u201csuch,\u201d a demonstrative adjective, \u201crefers to an antecedent, or a category of things previously mentioned.\u201d). Thus, under the second clause, the City is prohibited from taxing any services rendered by a person or company whose rates and service are fixed and regulated by the PUC. If, as S & H argues, the second clause was intended to apply to any public utility service (whether rate-regulated or not), the word \u201csuch\u201d would constitute mere surplusage.\nThe third clause, principally at issue here, prohibits local taxation of \u201cany privilege or transaction involving the rendering of any such public utility service.\u201d 53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.301.1(f)(2) (emphasis added). Again it is clear that word \u201csuch\u201d in the phrase \u201cany such public utility service\u201d refers to the \u201cservices\u201d described in the second clause \u2014 which, in turn, refers to the persons or companies identified in the first clause, i.e., those whose rates and service are fixed and regulated by the PUC. As a result, the third clause provides an exception from local taxation for any transaction or privilege involving the rendering of public utility services that are provided by a person or company whose service and rates are fixed and regulated by the PUC. Because the rates of the freight carriers with which S & H contracts are not fixed and regulated by the PUC, S & H may not benefit from the exception in the third clause regardless of whether it is \u201cinvolved in the rendering\u201d of such service. As a result, we need not decipher the meaning of that statutory phrase.\nWith respect to common motor carriers, the various exceptions from local taxation in all three clauses of Section 301.1(f)(2) apply only if a common motor carrier\u2019s rates and services are fixed and regulated by the PUC. In our view, this interpretation is both the product of a straightforward application of the rules of statutory interpretation and, importantly, consistent with the primacy of the PUC\u2019s rate-making authority. Balancing the needs of consumers and utilities, the PUC Code authorizes the PUC to fix the rates and charges for every public utility and requires that those rates and charges be \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d 66 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1301. To that end, Section 1303 of the Public Utility Code provides that no public utility shall, \u201cdirectly or indirectly,\u201d receive \u201ca greater or less rate for any service rendered or to be rendered by such public utility than that specified in the tariffs of such public utility applicable thereto.\u201d 66 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1303 (emphasis added). If local taxing authorities were permitted to tax rate-regulated services, the providers of those services would effectively receive rates lower than those specified in their filed tariffs. While one obvious purpose of the LTEA is to permit local taxing authorities to impose business privilege taxes, the exceptions in Section 301.1(f)(2) are intended to provide an appropriate limitation to eliminate any interference with the PUC\u2019s rate-making authority.\nIn its second issue, S & H contends that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s holding, which resulted in the application of the exception to only rate-regulated common carriers, contains an implicit assertion that the \u201cpublic utility\u201d exception of the LTEA has been repealed as the result of rate deregulation. S & H states:\nWhen the Pennsylvania Legislature wrote the LTEA, there is perhaps no way they could have foreseen the changes that have taken place in the industries considered public utilities over the past four decades. However, the Legislature has treated these ancillary entities as though they are exempt from taxation ever since deregulation began to make headlines in the 1970s. The Legislature has had ample opportunity to change Section 301.1(f)(2) of the LTEA if they believed that a change was necessary, and have not done so. Accordingly, the holding of the Commonwealth Court contains an implied assertion that the Public Utility Exemption [sic] provision in the LTEA has been impliedly repealed as the result of rate deregulation. Specifically, the provisions of the Public Utility Code, 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 102, which define public utility services broadly, and Section 301.1(f)(2)[,] which prohibits the local taxation of receipts derived from the rendering of public utility services[,] would be significantly altered based solely on the change in circumstances surrounding the nature of public utility regulation.\nBrief of S & H at 22-23.\nS & H\u2019s argument lacks merit. Nothing in the LTEA suggests that a person or company whose rates were once regulated by the PUC is forever shielded from local taxation. As discussed, the language of the public utility exception of the LTEA is clear. Only persons or companies whose rates are fixed and regulated by the PUC are excepted from local taxation, along with the services of such public utility and the transactions and privileges involving such public utility services. If, for whatever reason, such as deregulation, the PUC no longer fixes and regulates that person or company\u2019s rates, then that person or company is not entitled to the benefit of the exception from local taxation.\nThe order of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\n. City of York\u2019s (\"City\u201d) Business Privilege Tax is a tax on the privilege of doing business in the City. Persons desiring to do business in the City are required to obtain a business privilege/mercantile license and pay a tax on gross receipts. City of York Business Privilege and Mercantile Tax Ordinance (\"Ordinance\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 343.01-343.99. The business privilege tax is imposed at a rate of three and one-half mills or three dollars and fifty cents per one thousand dollars of gross volume of business. Ordinance, \u00a7 343.02(a). In the underlying litigation, S&H Transport, Inc. (\"S & H\u201d) raised a number of challenges to the City\u2019s business privilege tax assessment, including the taxability of S & H and the inclusion of certain amounts in gross receipts (e.g., amounts not attributable to activities within the City and amounts that S&H did not retain but paid to the freight carriers). In this appeal, we address only whether the City is barred from imposing a business privilege tax under the \"public utility\u201d exception,\n. The Public Utility Code, (\"PUC Code\u201d), 66 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 102, defines \"public utility\u201d as \"(1) Any person or corporations now or hereafter owning or operating in this Commonwealth equipment or facilities for: ... (iii) Transporting passengers or property as a common carrier.\u201d In turn, \"common carrier\u201d is defined as:\nAny and all persons or corporations holding out, offering, or undertaking, directly or indirectly, services for compensation to the public for the transportation of passengers or property, or both, or any class of passengers or property, between points within this Commonwealth by, through, over, above, or under land, water, or air, and shall include forwarders, but shall not include contract carriers by motor vehicles, or brokers, or any bona fide cooperative association transporting property exclusively for the members of such association on a nonprofit basis.\nId. Because the definition of \"common carrier\u201d excludes brokers, S & H is not itself a public utility.\n. Section 204(D)(3) of the City's Business Privilege and Mercantile Rules and Regulations (\u201cRegulations\") and Section 343.02(c)(3) of the City's Ordinance also contain a virtually identical provision excepting \"utilities\u201d from the business privilege tax. The pertinent provision of the City\u2019s Ordinance states:\nUtilities. No such tax shall be assessed and collected on the gross receipts from utility service of any person or company whose rates of service are fixed and regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, or on any public utility service rendered by any such person or company or on any privilege or transaction involving the rendering of any such public utility service.\nOrdinance, \u00a7 343.02(c)(3),\n. See Section 102 of the Regulations.\n. The City\u2019s Regulations require the filing of a business privilege tax return whether or not tax is due. Regulations, \u00a7 202,\n. Intrastate trucking involves the picking-up and dropping-off of shipments where both the origin and destination are in Pennsylvania. The PUC is the Pennsylvania authority that regulates intrastate trucking,\n. S & H holds a freight brokerage license issued by the FMCSA.\n. Pennsylvania, through the PUC, participates in the federal Unified Carrier Registration Act (\"UCR Act\u201d), 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13901. The UCR Act applies, inter alia, to freight brokers. Section 14504a of the UCR Act requires filing with the PUC information relating to financial responsibility and its local agent for service of process.\n. The trial court\u2019s use of the word \"exempt\u201d here is incorrect. As we explained in Lynnebrook and Woodbrook Associates, L.P. v. Borough of Millersville, 600 Pa. 108, 963 A.2d 1261 (2008), our jurisprudence distinguishes between the concepts of a tax exemption and a tax exception:\nWhere we determine the breadth of a taxing statute \u2014 whether a taxing authority is permitted by law to levy a particular tax \u2014 we consider whether a tax exception exists, and the presumption is in favor of the taxpayer. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1928(b)(3). By contrast, where we determine whether a person or property fits under a statutory provision enumerating exemptions from such taxing authority, we consider whether a tax exemption exists, and the presumption is in favor of the taxation authority. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1928(b)(5).\nId. at 1265.\nThe authority to tax, granted under Section 301.1(a) and (a.l) of the LTEA, is expressly limited by Section 301.1(f)(2). This statutory language, which acts to restrict the power of the taxing authority, must be construed as a tax exception \u2014 not a tax exemption. Any reasonable doubt concerning the meaning of statutory language involving an exception is resolved in favor of the taxpayer. Lynnebrook, 963 A.2d at 1265.\n. In light of its holding, the trial court did not consider S & H's other issues.\n. Section 2501(a) of the PUC Code provides, in relevant part:\n(a) Declaration of policy. \u2014 ... It is hereby found as a fact, after due investigation and deliberation, that the service of common carriers by motor vehicle, forwarders, contract carriers by motor vehicle, and brokers, including the procurement and provision of motor vehicles and other facilities for the safe transportation of passengers or property over the highways, are so closely interwoven and interdependent, and so directly affect each other, that in order effectively to regulate such common carriers by motor vehicle and forwarders, and to provide a proper and safe highway transportation system in the public interest, it is necessary to regulate the service of such contract carriers by motor vehicle and brokers, including the procurement and provision of motor vehicles and other facilities for the safe transportation of passengers or property over the highways, in the manner set forth in this chapter.\n66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2501(a).\n. S & H points to Ernest Renda Contracting, Co., Inc. v. Commonwealth, 516 Pa. 325, 532 A.2d 416 (1987), a case in which this Court held that the \"public utility\u201d exception to the Commonwealth\u2019s \"use tax\u201d under 72 P.S. \u00a7 7201(o)(4) extended to municipal utilities even though such entities are not, in a strict sense, a public utility regulated by the PUC. S & H suggests that Section 301.1(f)(2) of the LTEA follows this line of thought when it uses the phrase \"any public utility service.\" S & H contends that the word \"any\u201d in the second clause covers a separate legislatively defined class of services held out to the public without necessarily being the subject of PUC rate regulation.\n. The rates of property carriers were once, but are no longer, fixed and regulated by the PUC. Cf. Andrew Downer Crain, Ford, Carter, and Deregulation in the 1970s, 5 J. Telecomm. & High Tech. L. 413, 415-37 (2007) (providing a comprehensive overview of the efforts of Presidents Ford and Carter to deregulate the transportation industry, and noting the growing consensus at the time that both the industry and consumers would benefit from deregulation).\n. In In re Brock, 312 Pa. 92, 166 A. 785 (1933), this Court examined the adjective \"such\u201d in a statute that began: \"In case of the insolvency of any such individual, partnership, or unincorporated association, acting as a private banker....\u201d Id. at 787. Appellants in that case argued that this phrase referred to any individual or partnership. This Court disagreed, stating that to ignore the word \"such\u201d was \"to affront both grammar and public policy.\u201d Id. at 788. The Court explained further:\n'Such' i.e., 'that kind' of individual, partnership, etc., as used in that sentence can mean only the individual, etc., who has been duly licensed as a private banker. If the word 'such' does not mean that, it has no place or purpose whatever in the act. If the sentence quoted means what appellants contend it means, the word \u2018such\u2019 is entirely superfluous and should be deleted so that the sentence would read: \u2018In case of the insolvency of any individual,\u2019 etc., 'acting as a private banker,\u2019 etc. For us to delete a word from an act so as to give it a different meaning is for us to engage in legislation.\nId. at 787-88.\n. Section 1303 provides:\nNo public utility shall, directly or indirectly, by any device whatsoever, or in anywise, demand or receive from any person, corporation, or municipal corporation a greater or less rate for any service rendered or to be rendered by such public utility than that specified in the tariffs of such public utility applicable thereto. The rates specified in such tariffs shall be the lawful rates of such public utility until changed, as provided in this part. Any public utility, having more than one rate applicable to service rendered to a patron, shall, after notice of service conditions, compute bills under the rate most advantageous to the patron.\n66 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1303,"}
