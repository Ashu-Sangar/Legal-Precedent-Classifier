Hoff, 1 W. 440; Miller\u2019s Ap., 84 Pa. 391; High\u2019s Est., 136 Pa. 236. The difficulty is the appellant has failed to establish a trust. Prima facie the money belonged to appellant\u2019s wife in whose name it had been deposited, and the presumption thus raised has not been overcome.\nThe decree is affirmed, and the appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.
