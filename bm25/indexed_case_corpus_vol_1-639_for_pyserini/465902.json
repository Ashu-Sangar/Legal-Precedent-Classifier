{"id": "465902", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nThis appeal pertains to the construction of the residuary clause of the will of testator. The question involved is whether an intestacy has resulted as to a portion of the residuary estate. The learned court below held that it has not.\nIt will suffice to state that testator placed his entire residuary estate in trust, inter alia, to pay monthly to Ms son Caleb a fixed sum for life; thereafter to \u201chold and manage the same for the support, maintenance and education\u201d of the son\u2019s issue, but made no other disposition of the principal supporting the monthly payments to the son; testator made a gift over of the residuary estate effective \u2022 only if the son should die leaving no issue attaining 21 years of age.\nOn the adjudication of the trustee\u2019s account, Judge Penrose, in the Orphans\u2019 Court, awarded $55,000 to the trustee to secure the payment of the son\u2019s annuity. This award was unsuccessfully challenged in Cope\u2019s Estate, 328 Pa. 296, 195 A. 874, and is the fund now in question.\nCounsel for appellants strenuously urges that the trust for the son\u2019s issue, after his decease, related solely to the \u201csame\u201d income which the testator had provided for his son, and upon their father\u2019s death, the income was payable to such issue \u201cfor [their] support, maintenance and education\u201d until they respectively attained the age of 21 'years; that thereafter* the principal supporting the payments of income passed by intestacy.\nWe cannot add to the convincing answer of the learned auditing judge, unanimously approved by the court in banc, negativing appellants\u2019 contention; It is true that testator did not specifically aw\u00e1rd principal to the son\u2019s issue, but he clearly did so by implication. There is a gift over of principal to testator\u2019s wife should the son die without issue, or should the issue die under the age of twenty-one. The son left issue who were over 21 years. The auditing judge said: \u201cA devise over should B die without leaving issue is an implied devise to the issue should B leave any: Beilstein v. Beilstein, 194 Pa. 152; Lippincott\u2019s Estate, 276 Pa. 283; Murray\u2019s Estate, 313 Pa. 359; Howell\u2019s Estate, 41 D. & C. 332. And a gift over, if a devisee die before the age of twenty-one is an absolute gift if he survive twenty-one: Cassell v. Cooke, 8 Sergeant & Rawle, 268; Jeremy\u2019s Estate, 178 Pa. 477; Bosworth\u2019s Estate, 337 Pa. 265.\u201d\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed at the cost of appellants."}
