{"id": "1818949", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis is an appeal, by allowance, from an order of the Commonwealth Court which vacated an order of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board (Board) and reinstated an order of a referee in connection with a claim of work-related injury filed by Joseph L. Joseph, Jr. (Claimant). Claimant was performing duties in the course of his employment with the Delphi Company (Delphi), when, on July 9, 1981, he sustained an injury to his left knee. Delphi was a subcontractor performing work for a general contractor, Ross & Kennedy Corp. (R. & K.).\nAs a result of the injury, claim petitions were filed against Delphi, R. & K., and the workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier for Delphi, Rockwood Insurance Company (Rockwood). A referee determined that Claimant was entitled to compensation for total disability from the date of the injury until April 19,1982, and that compensation for partial disability was payable from the latter date through January 12, 1984, i.e., the date of the referee\u2019s order. The referee also determined that the general contractor, R. & K., was liable for payment of Claimant\u2019s medical expenses, compensation, and costs. This was based upon a finding that the insurance policy procured by Delphi from Rockwood was not in effect at the time of the injury, and, thus, that R. & K. was the responsible statutory employer for purposes of compensation. Hence, Rockwood was discharged from all liability, and liability attached to the insurer for R. & K., Bituminous Fire & Marine Insurance Co. (Bituminous).\nAn appeal was taken by R. & K. to the Board, and R. & K. forwarded to the Board a letter from the referee which stated that the record had inadvertently and prematurely been closed prior to receipt of a memorandum of law from R. & K. regarding insurance issues involved in the case. The letter, addressed to counsel for R. & K. and Bituminous, stated the following:\nI inadvertently closed the case without having receipt of your Memorandum of Law referable to the question of insurability.\nI am writing this in order to establish a premature closure of the record in order that the Appeal Board is apprised that a previous enlargement of time existed for submission of a Memorandum from your office, and the record was closed by this office before receipt of said Memorandum.\nI regret that the above closure has inconvenienced your office.\nIn response to the appeal by R. & K., and the letter from the referee, the Board issued the following order:\nIn Reviewing this Record it would appear it was prematurely closed. The Board is in receipt of an affidavit of the Referee indicating he did not consider an issue in the case. We therefore Remand this case for further proceedings before the Referee.\nThe Board\u2019s order did not, on its face, remand solely for admission of the memorandum of law that had been overlooked by the referee. Perhaps in the expectation that the referee\u2019s consideration of the memorandum might reveal a need to receive additional testimony or documents related to matters discussed in the memorandum, the Board granted a remand \u201cfor further proceedings.\u201d\nThe referee interpreted the Board\u2019s order remanding \u201cfor further proceedings\u201d as allowing him to reopen the hearing not only for the purpose of receiving the memorandum of law but also for the taking of additional testimony. Testimony was received relative to the respective potential liabilities of Rockwood and Bituminous, focusing primarily upon whether the policy issued by Rockwood had been effectively cancelled prior to Claimant\u2019s injury. Essentially no additional testimony was taken with regard to the extent or duration of Claimant\u2019s disability. The referee held, in December, 1984, that Delphi and Rockwood were responsible for payment of compensation, and that Claimant\u2019s disability terminated on January 11, 1983. Both of these findings plainly contradicted findings made by the referee prior to the remand.\nAppeals were taken to the Board by Rockwood and by Claimant, but the post-remand findings of the referee were affirmed. Appeals were then taken to the Commonwealth Court, whereupon the Board\u2019s affirmance was vacated and the pre-remand decision of the referee was reinstated. Joseph v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., 108 Pa. Commw.Ct. 636, 530 A.2d 954 (1987). The Commonwealth Court held that the case had been improperly remanded to the referee by the Board, and, thus, that the pre-remand findings of the referee would have to be reinstated on grounds they were adequately supported by the record.\nIn holding that the remand was not proper, the Commonwealth Court reasoned that a remand of a referee\u2019s decision is proper only when the referee has failed to resolve crucial issues raised by the parties or where the referee\u2019s findings of fact are not supported by the evidence. See Schuster v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., 74 Pa.Commw.Ct. 56, 62, 459 A.2d 846, 849 (1983). Inasmuch as the present case did not in the Commonwealth Court\u2019s view meet those criteria, it was held that the Board should have proceeded to review the referee\u2019s findings without paying heed to notice supplied by the referee that a relevant memorandum of law had erroneously been omitted from consideration as part of the record. We do not agree that the Board\u2019s remand powers are so precisely limited.\nWe granted allowance of appeal to address the propriety of the Board\u2019s remand in light of our recent decision in Cudo v. Hallstead Foundry, Inc., 517 Pa. 553, 539 A.2d 792 (1988). In Cudo, this Court stated that, to the extent that justice so requires, \u201c[t]he Board has broad powers to grant a rehearing.\u201d 517 Pa. at 557, 539 A.2d at 794 (footnote omitted). Cudo involved a remand to the referee pursuant to 77 P.S. \u00a7 871, which governs remands by the Board after Board decisions have been rendered, and which provides that rehearings may be granted \u201cupon cause shown.\u201d In the present case, where the Board had not rendered a decision on Claimant\u2019s case prior to issuing a remand order, cause for a remand was nevertheless clearly established, for the referee communicated to the Board that a notable error had been committed. It would have been unjust for the Board to proceed with a review of the referee\u2019s decision, after having been informed that a timely memorandum of law from one of the parties had been ignored by the referee.\nThis was a situation where a remand by the Board was plainly warranted. Where there has not already been a decision rendered by the Board, recognition of the power to remand in the interest of efficient and fair resolution of claims is even more compelling than in cases where a decision has previously been rendered. The Board should not be forced to review an imperfect decision of a referee that can, at that stage, very easily be rectified.\nWhether the referee failed to consider an issue entirely, as the Board\u2019s order infers, or rendered a decision on an issue without benefit of a timely memorandum of law from one of the parties, as the referee\u2019s letter indicates, the interests of justice require that the Board have power to remand for full consideration of such relevant matters. To hold otherwise would be to impose a rigidity upon procedures in this area of law that would be blind to the fairness of the ultimate decision reached. As stated in Cudo, 517 Pa. at 559, 539 A.2d at 794-95, \u201c[t]he law is well settled in this Commonwealth that rules of procedure are relaxed in workmen\u2019s compensation cases.\u201d To require a review of the record to be made by the Board without first permitting the referee to make a decision based upon a complete record would be incongruous indeed, and might lead to affirmance by the Board of decisions that, due to the lack of full consideration by the referee and the incompleteness of the record presented for review, erroneously appear sustainable.\nAs indicated in Cudo, supra, the Board has broad remand powers. See generally 77 P.S. \u00a7 852 (remand of questions of fact); 77 P.S. \u00a7 856 (remand for rehearing before a referee); 77 P.S. \u00a7 871 (remand for rehearing pending appeal); Borovich v. Colt Industries, 492 Pa. 372, 375-76, 424 A.2d 1237, 1239 (1981). In the present case, the purpose of the remand was not to have the referee reexamine the existing evidence, but rather to ensure that the referee would review a memorandum of law that might further the use of correct legal principles in rendering a decision. Remands for this purpose are within the Board\u2019s power. See Smith v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., 63 Pa. Commw.Ct. 340, 344, 437 A.2d 1301, 1302-03 (1981) (remand to have referee utilize the correct legal principle); McGraw-Edison/Power Systems Div. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., 62 Pa.Commw.Ct. 302, 305, 436 A.2d 706, 708 (1981). See also Bound Brook Corp. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., 47 Pa.Commw.Ct. 454, 408 A.2d 220 (1979) (remand would have been proper if claimant had been denied an opportunity to submit a brief to the referee).\nInasmuch as the Commonwealth Court determined that the Board\u2019s remand order was not proper, it reinstated the referee\u2019s original decision without addressing the merits of the referee\u2019s post-remand decision. Accordingly, having found that the Board\u2019s remand was in fact proper, we vacate the Commonwealth Court\u2019s order and remand for further disposition.\nOrder vacated, and case remanded.\nZAPPALA, J., concurs in the result.\nPAPADAKOS, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nLARSEN, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. On remand, issues to be addressed by the court below include that of whether, given that the Board\u2019s remand order was proper, the referee nevertheless exceeded the scope of remand or otherwise erred in altering his earlier findings as to the duration of Claimant\u2019s disability. See McCloskey v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., 501 Pa. 93, 97 n. 2, 460 A.2d 237, 239 n. 2 (1983) (plurality opinion) (referee erred in altering findings of fact without taking new evidence and in not confining his revisions to the stated purpose of the Board\u2019s remand); Glabern Corp. v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., 84 Pa. Commw.Ct. 381, 387, 479 A.2d 77, 80 (1984) (\u201cA referee should restrict remand proceedings to the purpose indicated by the Board\u2019s order. ...\u201d). Also to be addressed is the issue of whether the workmen\u2019s compensation insurance policy issued by Rockwood was effectively cancelled, prior to Claimant\u2019s injury, when a finance company having a power of attorney from Delphi requested cancellation of the policy. The latter issue was expressly left unaddressed by the court below, due to its holding that the remand order, which led to the referee\u2019s finding that Rockwood was liable, was improper."}
