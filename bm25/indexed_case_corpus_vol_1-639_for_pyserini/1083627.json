{"id": "1083627", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nPlaintiff appealed from an order making absolute a rule to show cause why a judgment entered on' a single bill, under seal, should not be opened and defendants allowed to make defense. Upon examination of the record and consideration of the arguments of counsel, we are not convinced the court below abused its discretion in making the order appealed from. See Tressler v. Emerick, 278 Pa. 128, and cases there cited.\nAppeal dismissed at costs of appellant."}
