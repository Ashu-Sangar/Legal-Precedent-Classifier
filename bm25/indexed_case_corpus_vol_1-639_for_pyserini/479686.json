{"id": "479686", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThe appellant, Ronald J. Bellan, was convicted by a jury of voluntary manslaughter. Post-verdict motions were denied and a three to six year sentence imposed. This appeal followed in which the appellant claims that he was prejudiced by (1) the trial court\u2019s questioning and comments during the trial (2) the holding of one night session and (3) the trial court\u2019s review of the evidence and instructions to the jury. A review of the record does not sustain the appellant\u2019s contention that prejudice resulted from any of the above claims. Cf. Commonwealth v. Leamer, 449 Pa. 76, 295 A.2d 272 (1972); Commonwealth v. Zapata, 447 Pa. 322, 290 A.2d 114 (1972); Commonwealth v. Watts, 358 Pa. 92, 56 A.2d 81 (1948). We have reviewed the record and conclude that the issues raised are without merit.\nThe judgment of sentence is affirmed."}
