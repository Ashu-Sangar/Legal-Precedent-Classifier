{"id": "584485", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nAngel Figueroa was convicted of murder in the second degree after a trial before a judge sitting without a jury. A motion for a new trial was denied, and a prison sentence of three to twenty years was imposed. Figueroa then filed this appeal.\nPrincipally, Figueroa argues the Commonwealth\u2019s trial evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish his guilt of the crime of which he was convicted beyond a reasonable doubt.\nAt trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s ease against Figueroa rested entirely on the testimony of one Ramon Rasado, which may be summarized as follows:\nRasado, Francisco Lopez, and Antonia Yasquez were seated at a bar in Philadelphia when Lopez rose from his seat and informed his companions he was going to speak to a friend in the bar. Figueroa who was seated nearby rose to his feet and said, \u201cThat one that just stood up, now I\u2019m going to slap him.\u201d Rasado immediately arose, confronted Figueroa and said, \u201cIf you are going to slap that guy you\u2019re gonna have to slap me too, because he is my friend.\u201d Figueroa retreated to the other end of the bar.\nSeveral minutes later, Lopez rejoined his companions and sat on the seat at the bar he had previously occupied. Shortly thereafter, Figueroa approached Lopez, rapidly raised his arm in the air and in a downward movement brought his hand into contact with the front of Lopez\u2019s body near the belt line. Lopez immediately fell to the floor and Figueroa departed from the bar through the front door.\nLopez was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead upon arrival. A post mortem examination established death was caused by a stab wound in the left side of the abdomen with incision of the colon and small intestine, and with transection of the aorta.\nIt is urged that the lack of any testimony showing Figueroa had a knife when he brought his hand into contact with Lopez\u2019s body, plus the conflict in the testimony of the eyewitness Rasado as to the point of contact with Lopez\u2019s body, renders the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence insufficient as a matter of law to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We disagree.\nThe Commonwealth is entitled to every inference reasonably arising from the evidence. Commonwealth v. Agie, 449 Pa. 187, 296 A.2d 741 (1972), and Commonwealth v. Oates, 448 Pa. 486, 295 A.2d 337 (1972). Moreover, the guilt of one accused of crime may be established beyond a reasonable doubt by circumstantial evidence alone. Commonwealth v. Cimaszewski, 447 Pa. 141, 288 A.2d 805 (1972), and Commonwealth v. Boden, 399 Pa. 298, 159 A.2d 894 (1960). We are completely satisfied when the instant trial testimony is read in the most favorable light to the Commonwealth, it is adequate to establish Figueroa committed the stabbing here involved, and the trial court\u2019s finding of guilt of murder in the second degree was legally warranted.\nJudgment affirmed.\nA motion in arrest of judgment was not entered.\nAppellant advances another assignment of error; however, a review of the record shows this issue was not raised in the post trial motion, consequently, it was not properly preserved for appeal. See Commonwealth v. Hill, 453 Pa. 349, 310 A.2d 88 (1973) ; Commonwealth v. Bittner, 441 Pa. 216, 272 A.2d 484 (1971) ; Commonwealth v. Myers, 439 Pa. 381, 266 A.2d 756 (1970).\nOn direct examination, Basado fixed the point of contact by pointing to the left front side of his body. On cross-examination, he pointed to the right front side."}
