{"id": "988616", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nThis Court granted review to determine whether the Commonwealth Court erred in holding appellees, administrators of the Estate of Andrew Jonathan Wagner, could subpoena from the Department of Public Welfare (DPW), a copy of a performance audit generated by DPW\u2019s investigation into the death of 14-month-old Andrew Jonathan Wagner. We hold such document is a statutorily-defined performance audit and beyond the scope of discovery by the administrators; accordingly, we reverse.\nOn February 18, 1999, decedent sustained fatal injuries while in the care of a babysitter. Appellant, Lehigh County Office of Children and Youth Services (CYS), had previously investigated the babysitter in connection with alleged abuse involving other children under her care. As suggested by 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6343(b), decedent\u2019s death prompted DPW to conduct a performance audit of Lehigh CYS to determine whether it had complied with the Child Protective Services Law (CPSL), 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6300-6385, when handling the prior allegations of abuse, and to identify ways to improve its monitoring system. Essentially, DPW sought to determine whether changes should be made to CYS\u2019s policies and procedures, to help prevent future tragedies.\nAs part of this audit, commonly referred to as a \u201cchild death review,\u201d DPW reviewed CYS\u2019s records, including relevant medical records, and interviewed agency staff, decedent\u2019s parents, the babysitter, and the parents of at least one other child who had previously been in the babysitter\u2019s care. DPW sent its findings and recommendations to Lehigh County\u2019s county executive. The county executive distributed the review to other individuals within the county who were responsible for preparing a \u201cplan of correction.\u201d When completed, that plan was submitted to DPW.\nSometime thereafter, the administrators filed a petition for issuance of a subpoena duces tecum, to the regional director of the Pennsylvania Office of Children and Youth Services. The estate sought pre-complaint discovery from DPW, to assist in determining whether they had a claim against CYS or any other public agencies. Specifically, the administrators sought a subpoena requiring DPW to produce all \u201cnotes, records, reports and/or correspondence prepared and compiled by [CYS] in connection with [DPW\u2019s] reviews of [CYS\u2019s] procedures in the child abuse investigations of [the babysitter].\u201d Petition for Issuance of Subpoena Duces Tecum, 11/13/00, at 2. DPW asserted that the child death review was confidential under the CPSL, see 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6339 (designating certain child protective services information as confidential), and that the administrators were not among the individuals to whom such confidential information could be released. See id., \u00a7 6340 (pertaining to release of confidential information).\nOn January 22, 2001, the trial court conducted hearing; the only witness was Len Pocius, Director of DPW\u2019s Northeast Region. Following the hearing, the court found the child death review was a confidential report under \u00a7 6339 of the CPSL, but the administrators were nevertheless entitled to a copy pursuant to \u00a7 6340(b), which permits \u201csubjects of\u2019 confidential reports to obtain copies. See id., \u00a7 6340(b). The court ordered DPW to produce the review, although it permitted the agency to redact the identities of people who reported suspected child abuse or cooperated with the audit.\nOn appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed. In re Estate of Wagner, 791 A.2d 444 (Pa.Cmwlth.2002). Unlike the trial court, the Commonwealth Court concluded the child death review was not a \u201creport\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 6339. It explained that reading \u00a7 6339 in conjunction with other portions of the CPSL, it was apparent the General Assembly intended the term \u201creports\u201d as used in \u00a7 6339 to \u201crefer to reports of suspected or confirmed child abuse made under the [CPSL,]\u201d including those specifically defined in \u00a7 6303, namely, \u201c \u2018founded report,\u2019 \u2018founded report for school employee,\u2019 \u2018indicated report,\u2019 \u2018indicated report for school employees\u2019 and \u2018unfounded report.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 447 (citing 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303). Accordingly, the Commonwealth Court determined the child death review was not entitled to the blanket confidentiality afforded to \u201creports\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 6339. Id.\nThe court noted, however, that aside from \u201creports,\u201d \u00a7 6339 also designates as confidential \u201cany other information obtained ... or photographs or X-rays taken concerning alleged instances of child abuse.\u201d Id., at 448 (quoting 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6339) (internal quotations omitted). It held that the child death review, although \u201cnot a report made within the meaning of Section 6339 [of the CPSL],\u201d id., at 447, was confidential \u201cto the extent that it contains any information or other material obtained by Lehigh CYS concerning alleged instances of suspected or confirmed child abuse.\u201d Id., at 448. However, the court also held that insofar as such information pertained to the abuse of decedent, the administrators qualified as \u201csubject[s] of a report,\u201d because they are the \u201cparent[s], guardian[s] or other person[s] responsible for the welfare of a child ... named in a report,\u201d 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(a), and were therefore entitled under \u00a7 6340(b) of the CPSL to obtain that information. In re Estate of Wagner, at 448.\nBasically, the Commonwealth Court reasoned that since a \u201csubject of a report\u201d is entitled to this information anyway, as provided in \u00a7 6303(a), the administrators could discover those portions of the review containing this information\u2014only those portions which were explicitly shielded in other parts of the CPSL were prohibited from discovery. In addition, the court stated the General Assembly did not intend \u201cto create a privilege to protect the disclosures of DPW or local agency workers about their job performance and the job performances of their colleagues.\u201d Id. It ordered DPW to produce those portions of the review that pertained to CYS\u2019s handling of decedent\u2019s case, without discussing any other child abuse case, as well as any portions of the review \u201cthat derive[d] from\u201d reports of suspected or confirmed child abuse that mentioned decedent or his parents. Id. Further, like the trial court, the Commonwealth Court permitted DPW to redact the identities of persons who had reported abuse or cooperated with the audit. See id., at 449.\nCYS and DPW sought this Court\u2019s review, arguing the Commonwealth Court erred in requiring DPW to produce any portions of the child death review\u2014particularly the self-assessments and performance critiques\u2014when \u00a7 6339 of the CPSL dictates that the entire audit is confidential and not subject to disclosure. We hold child death reviews are what the General Assembly has designated them: intergovernmental performance audits, not reports pursuant to \u00a7 6339, and are available to only those authorized in \u00a7 6343(b). Additionally, we reject this piecemeal discovery approach to these audits and conclude public policy requires the entire child review be protected.\nAs questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law, this Court\u2019s review is plenary. Gustine Uniontown Assocs., Ltd. v. Anthony Crane Rental, Inc., 577 Pa. 14, 842 A.2d 334, 343 (2004). We are charged with giving effect to every word and provision in a statute. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). Moreover, we are not to \u201cinterpret statutory words in isolation, but must read them with reference to the context in which they appear.\u201d O\u2019Rourke v. Dept. of Corr., 566 Pa. 161, 778 A.2d 1194, 1201 (2001). Ultimately, if upon application of these interpretive principles, we conclude that a statutory provision is unclear, we may consider other factors in ascertaining the General Assembly\u2019s intent. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c); Mishoe v. Erie Ins. Co., 573 Pa. 267, 824 A.2d 1153, 1155 (2003). However, if a statute is \u201cclear and free from all ambiguity,\u201d we may not disregard the letter of it \u201cunder the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b).\nSection 6339, entitled \u201cConfidentiality of Reports,\u201d provides in full:\nExcept as otherwise provided in this subchapter, reports made pursuant to this chapter, including, but not limited to, report summaries of child abuse and written reports made pursuant to section 6313(b) and (c) (relating to reporting procedure) as well as any other information obtained, reports written or photographs or X-rays taken concerning alleged instances of child abuse in the possession of the department or a county agency shall be confidential.\n23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6339. However, the CPSL also enumerates certain categories of individuals and entities to whom DPW and county agencies must disclose such confidential material. To that end, \u00a7 6340 provides, in relevant part:\nRelease of Information in Confidential Reports\n(a) General rule.\u2014Reports specified in section 6339 (relating to confidentiality of reports) shall only be made available to:\n* * *\n(11) Designated county officials, in reviewing the competence of the county agency or its employees pursuant to this chapter....\n(b) Release of information to subject of report.\u2014At any\ntime and upon written request, a subject of a report may receive a copy of all information, except that prohibited from being disclosed by subsection (c), contained in the Statewide central register or in any report filed pursuant to section 6313 (relating to reporting procedure).\n(c) Protecting identity of person making report.\u2014Except for reports pursuant to subsection (a)(9) and (10), the release of data that would identify the person who made a report of suspected child abuse or the person who cooperated in a subsequent investigation is prohibited unless the secretary finds the release will not be detrimental to the safety of that person. Law enforcement officials shall treat all reporting sources as confidential informants.\nId, \u00a7 6340. Meanwhile, the statute defines \u201c[sjubject of the report\u201d as \u201c[a]ny child, parent, guardian or other person responsible for the welfare of a child or any alleged or actual perpetrator or school employee named in a report made to [DPW] or a county agency under this chapter.\u201d Id., \u00a7 6803(a).\nDPW and CYS maintain that the child death review is a confidential audit within the meaning of \u00a7 6339. They further assert that even though the administrators qualify as \u201csubjects of a report,\u201d they cannot gain access to the report\u2019s contents, because the \u201csubject of report\u201d exception to confidentiality only affords qualifying parties access to reports of suspected or confirmed child abuse pertaining to them and information in the Statewide Central Register {i.e., indicated and founded reports of abuse), see id., \u00a7 6340(b), and the child death review is neither.\nThe child death review at issue qualifies as neither a report \u201cmade pursuant to [the CPSL]\u201d nor a report written \u201cconcerning alleged instances of child abuse.... \u201d Id., \u00a7 6339. The General Assembly established the child death review as an intergovernmental performance audit, with the objective of fostering, between multiple governmental agencies, unreserved evaluation of actions taken and forgone. These audits at times include admissions of second-guessing and hindsight analyses, calculated to improve the system for future care; they do not focus on the allegations of abuse, but on the system\u2019s response to those allegations. These audits are not intended to become fodder for those looking to redress past shortcomings, misconduct, torts, or crimes.\nIn V.B.T. v. Family Services of West. Pa., 705 A.2d 1325, 1333 (Pa.Super.1998), affirmed, 556 Pa. 430, 728 A.2d 953 (1999), this Court adopted the Superior Court\u2019s opinion, which reasoned:\nThe type of disclosure advocated by these plaintiffs, in contrast, is not aimed at helping the abused child or the abusive family, nor is it intended to facilitate criminal prosecution of the abuser. Rather, it is geared towards vindicating the injuries suffered by the plaintiffs and their daughter. While these interests are important, our legislature has made the judgment that attempting to remedy the serious problem of child abuse in our society and to protect and rehabilitate the powerless victims of such abuse is of superior importance. We thus must conclude that discovery by the plaintiffs of materials protected by the [CPSL], which is neither authorized by the provisions of the CPSL itself nor in furtherance of its goals, may not be permitted.\nId., at 1336 (footnote omitted). Likewise, disclosure of the governmental audit, aimed not at the individual allegations, but at \u201cthe serious problem of child abuse in our society,\u201d id., would surely hamper candor by those involved and chill this imperative information flow, defeating the stated purpose of the CPSL.\nIn enacting the CPSL, the General Assembly made clear its objective:\nIt is the purpose of this chapter to encourage more complete reporting of suspected child abuse; to the extent permitted by this chapter, to involve law enforcement agencies in responding to child abuse; and to establish in each county protective services for the purpose of investigating the reports swiftly and competently, providing protection for children from further abuse....\n23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6302(b). This objective is frustrated if child death reviews are discoverable to plaintiffs searching for potential mistakes in order to support a lawsuit. See V.B.T., at 1333 (\u201c[sections 6339 and 6340] do not include a civil plaintiff seeking discovery in pursuit of a claim for damages based upon alleged conduct of the abused child.\u201d). Openness and necessary admissions of employees are vital to improving the care of children subject to CYS and DPW oversight. If candor is not encouraged through confidentiality, improvement will be compromised as employees must inevitably seek to shield their own errors from reviewers out of fear of being sued. This scenario flies in the face of the designed goals of the CPSL. See Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 60-61, 107 S.Ct. 989, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987) (as designated in CPSL, Pennsylvania has \u201ccompelling interest in protecting its child-abuse information.\u201d).\nIt has traditionally been the policy in Pennsylvania that remedial measures taken after an injury are not admissible, a policy now embodied in our Rules of Evidence. See Pa. R.Evid. 407. This rule allows parties to fix a problem without fear that by doing so, they will admit liability. The same policy prevents discovery here, for the review is to identify remedial possibilities and better safeguard children; if the results are discoverable, no admissions leading to remedial actions will be forthcoming. Were child death reviews less than confidential, they would not be worth conducting and would disappear.\nIn sum, these intergovernmental audits must be used to promote the implementation of better child protective procedures; they cannot accomplish this if agencies and workers fear making discoverable admissions that may lead to liability. \u201cCYA\u201d does not trump improvement of CYS. The statute creating these reviews, and the clearly expressed public policy of the General Assembly and this Court, mandate that no portion of these audits be available to plaintiffs as discovery.\nOrder reversed. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nFormer Justice LAMB did not participate in the decision of this case.\nJustice NIGRO files a dissenting opinion in which Justice SAYLOR joins.\n. The babysitter pled guilty to third degree homicide in April, 2000, and was sentenced to 10 to 40 years incarceration.\n. DPW's authority to conduct this performance audit derives from the Child Protective Services Law, which provides:\nInvestigating performance of county agency\n(b) Performance Audit.\u2014Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the secretary or a designee of the secretary may direct, at their discretion, and after reasonable notice to the county agency, a performance audit of any activity engaged in pursuant to this chapter. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6343(b).\n. None of the parties contend \u00a7 6339 is ambiguous; they disagree as to the \u201cplain meaning\u201d of the provision. See DPW's Brief, at 12 (\"This Court should find the relevant provisions of the CPSL to be unambiguous....\u201d); Administrators' Brief, at 9 n. 6 (\"[T)he 'plain wording' of Section 6339, especially when read in pari materia with the other referenced sections, certainly does not support the complete shielding of the performance audit....\u201d). We agree the provision is unambiguous when read in context, and need not resort to principles reserved for an ambiguous statute.\n. Section 6313(b) and (c) provide:\n(b) Oral reports.\u2014Oral reports shall be made to the department pursuant to Subchapter C (relating to powers and duties of department) and may be made to the appropriate county agency. When oral reports of suspected child abuse are initially received at the county agency, the protective services staff shall, after seeing to the immediate safety of the child and other children in the home, immediately notify the department of the receipt of the report, which is to be held in the pending complaint file as provided in Subchapter C. The initial child abuse report summary shall be supplemented with a written report when a determination is made as to whether a report of suspected child abuse is a founded report, an unfounded report or an indicated report, (c) Written reports.\u2014Written reports from persons required to report [suspected child abuse] under section 6311 shall be made to the appropriate county agency in a manner and on forms the department prescribes by regulation. The written reports shall include [certain hereafter designated] information if available.... 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6313(b), (c)."}
