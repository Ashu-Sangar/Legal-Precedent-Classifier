Said point is as follows: \u201c That under all the evidence, the verdict of the jury must be in favor of the defendant.\u201d This assumes that there was not sufficient evidence to submit to the jury of the plaintiff\u2019s adverse possession of the premises in controversy for twenty-one years. Without discussing the voluminous testimony upon this question, it is enough to say that in our opinion there was sufficient evidence to carry the case to the jury. It was not error, therefore, to decline the point.\nJudgment affirmed."}
