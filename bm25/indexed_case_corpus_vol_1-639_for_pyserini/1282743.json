{"id": "1282743", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones,\nAre the secretary and treasurer, or either, of a third class school district subject to removal from office at the pleasure and discretion of the board of school directors, the appointing power?\nOn May 7,1957 Harold R. Philips was elected school district treasurer for a 1 year term; on June 4, 1957 William H. Buell was elected school district secretary for a 4 year term. Both individuals were elected by the Union Township board of school directors, said. Township being located in Washington County.\nOn December 2, 1957 Buell and Philips were dismissed by the board of school directors without any hearing or stated cause. Buell and Philips each sued the school district in assumpsit for an alleged wrongful discharge from employment and claimed their respective salaries for the balance of the unexpired terms for which they had been elected. Preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer filed by the school district were sustained by the 'Court of Common Pleas of Washington County and from its order these appeals were taken.\nThe respective contentions of the parties are clear. Appellants contend that the exclusive method for the removal of school district officers, such as a secretary and treasurer, is provided by art. V, \u00a7514 of the School Code of 1949, which states \u201cThe board of school directors in any school district, except as herein otherwise provided, shall after due notice, giving the reasons therefor, and after hearing if demanded, have the right at any time to remove any of its officers . . . for ineompetency, intemperance, neglect of duty, violation of any of the school laws of this Commonwealth, or other improper conduct.\u201d On the other hand, appellee justifies appellants\u2019 summary removal on the basis of art. VI, \u00a74 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which provides \u201cAppointed officers, other than judges of the courts of record and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, may be removed at the pleasure of the power by which they shall have been .appointed.\u201d\nNeither Buell nor Philips were elected by popular vote; the source of their selection was the board of school directors and while the selection of appellants is termed an election under the statute, actually it was an appointment. Both appointees were selected at a fixed salary for a fixed term.\nThe present problem lacks novelty. That a treasurer or collector of public monies, including a treasurer of a school district, is a \u201cpublic officer\u201d as distinguished from an \u201cemployee\u201d is clear: Commonwealth v. Evans, 74 Pa. 124, 139; Commonwealth v. Morrisey, 86 Pa. 416; Houseman et al. v. Commonwealth ex rel. Tener, 100 Pa. 222; Commonwealth v. Sulzner, 198 Pa. 502, 48 A. 476; Muir v. Madden, 286 Pa. 233, 133 A. 226; Commonwealth ex rel. v. Hiltner, 307 Pa. 343, 161 A. 323. If not expressly, at least impliedly, the status of a secretary of a municipality and a school board as a \u201cpublic officer\u201d has been recognized: Commonwealth ex rel. v. Likeley, 267 Pa. 310, 110 A. 167; Teachers\u2019 Tenure Act Cases, 329 Pa. 213, 230, 197 A. 344; Howell v. Keeler, 5 Pa. D. & C. 90. Both a school district treasurer and secretary being \u201cpublic officers\u201d, are such officers \u201cappointed officers\u201d under art. VI, \u00a74 of the Constitution?\nAs to the status of a school district treasurer we have expressly held that a school district treasurer is removable at the pleasure of the appointive power under art. VI, \u00a74 of the Constitution. In Commonwealth v. Sulzner, 198 Pa. 502, supra, we affirmed per curiam a ruling that the treasurer of a school district was removable at- the pleasure of the board of school directors under the Constitutional provision. Subsequent thereto, the legislature on May 18, 1911 provided a method for the removal of school district officers identical in its language with Section 514 of the present School Code of 1949. Subsequent thereto, this Court was again presented with the problem of the removability of a school board treasurer and in Muir v. Madden, 286 Pa. 233, supra, we affirmed per curiam a ruling of a lower court that a school district treasurer was removable at the pleasure of the board of school directors. In the Muir case it was stated (pp. 235, 236) : \u201cThough section 406 is new legislation, in that no provision like it appears in prior statutes, yet, . . . long before their mention in the Act of 1911, school treasurers were in the class of appointed officers recognized by the organic law of the State; so it cannot be doubted that article VI, section 4, of the Constitution, making such officers removable only at the pleasure of the appointing power, applies to them, and the law as ruled in the Sulzner Case controls: . . .\u201d In Commonwealth ex rel. v. Hiltner, 307 Pa, 343, supra, we held that a borough treasurer could be removed at the pleasure of the body which appointed him, recognizing that the language of art. VI, \u00a74, was so clear and unequivocal as to render inconsistent any claim that such an officer could be removed only for cause.\nAs to the status of a school district secretary, while we have not passed directly on such status it is equally clear that a school district secretary is removable at the pleasure of the body which appointed him. In Commonwealth ex rel. v. Likeley, 267 Pa. 310, supra, we held that a borough clerk \u2014 possessing municipal duties almost identical with those of a school board secretary\u2014 was an appointed officer removable at the pleasure of the power which appointed him. Dictum in Teachers\u2019 Tenure Act Cases, 329 Pa. 213, 230, supra, affords the same status to a school board secretary. See also: Howell v. Keeler, 5 Pa. D. & C. 90.\nTo the extent that Art. V, \u00a7514 of the School Code of 1949 is in conflict with Art. VI, \u00a74 of the Constitution, the former is invalid.\nNo compelling reason has been advanced to justify a change of position by this Court or to predicate our adoption of a new policy which would require that we overrule these several decision's of this Court. Moreover, as a practical matter, it seems better to allow the discretion of removability at pleasure of these appointed school officials to rest upon the board of school directors. The secretary and treasurer of a school board must not only work for the board of school directors, but with it.\nOrder affirmed. Costs on appellants.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones concurs in the result.\nBy virtue of the Act of March 10, 1949, P. L. 30, art. IV. \u00a7404, as amended by the Act of August 9, 1955, P.
