{"id": "481001", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis appeal presents questions of statutory interpretation concerning the applicability of the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law, Act of December 17, 1968, P.L. 1224, \u00a7\u00a7 1-9, 73 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 201-1 to 201-9 (1971).\nThe Commonwealth, pursuant to the Consumer Protection Law, initiated an original action in the Commonwealth Court against twenty-five landlords who use printed form leases allegedly in violation of the Law, and four companies which print and sell these form leases. Three violations of the Consumer Protection Law are asserted. First, because the leases employ, according to the complaint, \u201carchaic and technical language beyond the easy comprehension of the consumer of average intel-\nligence,\u201d it is maintained that the use of such leases constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice. The complaint next alleges that the inclusion of certain provisions in the printed form leases is unfair and deceptive. The provisions, the use of which is challenged by the Commonwealth, are \u201c(a) lessor\u2019s \u2018right\u2019 to distrain for rent, (b) lessee\u2019s unconditional warrant of attorney, (c) lessor\u2019s unconditional \u2018right\u2019 to confess judgment, (d) lessee\u2019s unconditional waiver of unexplained rights including statutory rights, (e) lessor\u2019s unlimited discretion to accellerate [sic] lessee\u2019s rent, (f) lessee\u2019s waiver of claim for lessor\u2019s negligence, for himself and for third parties, (g) lessor affidavit of default is conclusive evidence of default, (h) lessee\u2019s waiver to oppose \u2018amicable\u2019 action in ejectment, (i) lessee\u2019s waiver of demand, notice, right of appeal, to a stay and standing to open or strike judgments.\u201d Finally, the failure to include in the form leases notice to the tenant of his statutory rights \u2014 some of which are nonwaivable \u2014 is, according to the Commonwealth, misleading and confusing.\nPreliminary objections were filed by sixteen defendants, answers by five, and no responsive pleading by two. The preliminary objections raised the lack of jurisdiction under the Consumer Protection Law, failure to state a cause of action, the existence of an adequate remedy at law, and certain procedural challenges. The Commonwealth Court found it convenient, useful, and desirable to treat the pleadings as if there were a single preliminary objection. Commonwealth v. Monumental Properties, Inc., 10 Pa.Cmwlth. 596, 602, 314 A.2d 333, 335 (1973).\nWithout ruling on any of the procedural objections of appellees, the Commonwealth Court held that the leasing of housing did not fall within the purview of the Consumer Protection Law. It then proceeded, apparently on the assumption that leasing is covered by the Law, to consider whether the Commonwealth otherwise stated a cause of action; it held that the Commonwealth had not. Next, the court concluded that the printing of form leases by the four \u201cform sellers\u201d could be a violation of the Consumer Protection Law, but that in the instant case there were \u201cnot sufficient allegations of clear violation to support the complaint and that it [with respect to the form sellers], therefore, must be dismissed.\u201d 10 Pa.Cmwlth. at 617, 314 A.2d at 343. Continuing, the Commonwealth Court stated that it was not empowered to grant the relief requested by the Commonwealth. It then sustained the preliminary objections and dismissed the Commonwealth\u2019s complaint with respect to all defendants.\nThe Commonwealth appealed. For reasons which follow, we affirm in part and vacate and remand in part.\nI\nThe dominating question is whether the Consumer Protection Law covers allegedly unfair or deceptive practices in connection with the leasing of housing. We hold it does. Our review must begin at the beginning, with the language of the statute.\nSection 3 states the legislative direction in clear and expansive language.\n\u201cUnfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce are hereby declared unlawful.\u201d\nDespite this embracive mandate, appellees contend that their use of printed form leases is not covered by the Consumer Protection Law. The argument advanced, and accepted by the Commonwealth Court, is that the business of leasing housing is excluded from the Law\u2019s scope because it is not \u201cthe conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d We cannot agree.\nA\nThe Legislature sought by the Consumer Protection Law to benefit the public at large by eradicating, among other things, \u201cunfair or deceptive\u201d business practices. Just as earlier legislation was designed to equalize the position of employer and employee and the position of insurer and insured, this Law attempts to place on more equal terms seller and consumer. These remedial statutes are all predicated on a legislative recognition of the unequal bargaining power of opposing forces in the marketplace. Instantly, the Legislature strove, by making certain modest adjustments, to ensure the fairness of market transactions. No sweeping changes in legal relationships were occasioned by the Consumer Protection Law, since prevention of deception and the exploitation of unfair advantage has always been an object of remedial legislation.\nAlthough the Consumer Protection Law did articulate the evils desired to be remedied, the statute\u2019s underlying foundation is fraud prevention. This Court emphatically stated in Verona v. Schenley Farms Co., 312 Pa. 57, 64, 167 A. 317, 320 (1933), \u201c[a]s a statute for the prevention of fraud, it must be liberally construed to effect the purpose. . . .\u201d Accord, Commercial Banking Corp. v. Freeman, 353 Pa. 563, 567, 46 A.2d 233, 235 (1946); Alford v. Raschiatore, 163 Pa.Super. 635, 63 A.2d 366 (1949); Nolan v. Jones, 67 Pa.Super. 430 (1917), aff\u2019d, 263 Pa. 124, 106 A. 235 (1919); Rudy v. Friedman, 54 Pa.D. & C.2d 628 (C.P. Delaware County 1971). See generally 3 J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 70.01 (C. Sands ed. 1974); 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries * 88-89.\nSince the Consumer Protection Law was in relevant part designed to thwart fraud in the statutory sense, it is to be construed liberally to effect its obj\u00e9ct of preventing unfair or deceptive practices.\nB\nNecessarily, we reject the Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion that the Consumer Protection Law must be strictly construed. The Commonwealth Court held that the statute was penal in nature and therefore required a strict construction. This characterization ignores settled case law, e. g., Commercial Banking Corp. v. Freeman, supra; Verona v. Schenley Farms Co., supra; Commonwealth v. Shaleen, 215 Pa. 595, 64 A. 797 (1906), and the clear language of the Statutory Construction Act, 1 Pa.S. \u00a7 1928 (Special Pamphlet, 1973).\nTo reach its result the hearing court focused on section 8 of the Consumer Protection Law. That section limits to $5000 the amount of fine payable upon violation of an injunction issued under section 4.\n\u201c[BJecause the Act in question permits the Commonwealth to petition for civil penalties up to $5,000 (if an injunction is issued by this Court as a result of the present action) . . . the Act contains a penal\nprovision, and therefore must be strictly construed.\u201d Commonwealth v. Monumental Properties, Inc., 10 Pa. Cmwlth, 596, 607, 314 A.2d 333, 337-338 (1974).\nWe, however, need not address the question whether section 8 is truly a penal provision, for even assuming arguendo that it is, the Commonwealth Court\u2019s conclusion cannot stand. The logical flaw in the reasoning of the hearing court is that, if a statute \u201ccontains\u201d a penal provision, the entire statute must be strictly eonstrued. This notion is strikingly at odds with 1 Pa. S. \u00a7 1928 (Special Pamphlet, 1973). Section 1928 directs that although penal provisions are to be strictly construed, all others \u201cshall be liberally construed to effect their objects and to promote justice.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1928(c). The legislative emphasis is on provisions, not statutes in their entirety. Our cases are in accord. See Commercial Banking Corp. v. Freeman, 353 Pa. at 567, 46 A.2d at 235-236; Verona v. Schenley Farms Co., 312 Pa. at 65, 167 A. at 320; Commonwealth v. Shaleen, 215 Pa. at 597, 64 A. at 798; Koch\u2019s Estate, 5 Rawle 338, 340 (Pa. 1835); Commonwealth v. Yaste, 166 Pa.Super., 275, 70 A.2d 685 (1950); Commonwealth v. Hagy, 58 Lancaster L.Rev. 47, 49 (Pa.Q.S.Lancaster County 1962).\nHere, we are concerned with the effect of provisions which are in no sense penal. Section 3 in sweeping language declares the concerns of the Legislature, and section 2 further and more fully defines those concerns. These expansive provisions reflect the legislative judgment that unfairness and deception in all consumer transactions must be halted. These sections of the Consumer Protection Law, in accordance with the legislative intent, are to be liberally construed to effectuate that intent.\nC\nThe Commonwealth Court was also persuaded by its conclusion that there exists no precedent under the federal models of the Consumer Protection Law to support a holding that the Law covers the leasing of apartment housing. The Consumer Protection Law has regularly been interpreted by the Commonwealth Court as being based on the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Lanham Trademark Act. Commonwealth v. Monu mental Properties, Inc., 10 Pa.Cmwlth. 596, 608, 314 A. 2d 333, 338 (1974); Commonwealth v. Hush-Tone Industries, Inc., 4 Pa.Cmwlth. 1, 20-21 (1971). Accord, Commonwealth v. Foster, 57 Pa.D. & C.2d 203, (C.J. Allegheny County 1972); cf. Commonwealth v. Pennsylvania APSCO System, Inc., 10 Pa.Cmwlth. 138, 140, 309 A.2d 184, 185 (1973). Indeed, in all relevant respects the language of section 3 of the Consumer Protection Law and section 5 of the FTC Act is identical. The Lanham Act\u2019s similarity to the Consumer Protection Law is likewise strong. We thus agree with the Commonwealth Court that \u201c 'we may look to the decisions under those Acts for guidance and interpretation.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Monumental Properties, Inc., 10 Pa.Cmwlth. at 608, 314 A.2d at 338 (quoting Commonwealth v. Hush-Tone Industries, Inc., 4 Pa.Cmwlth. at 21).\nThe Commonwealth Court in large part based its result that the leasing of residential apartments is not covered by the Consumer Protection Law on this proposition.\n\u201cWe have studied both of these Federal statutes and find no mention of the rental of real property. Furthermore, we have found no case wherein the leasing of property has been brought within the purview of those Federal statutes.\u201d\n10 Pa.Cmwlth. at 608-609, 314 A.2d at 338. It is enough to show that this reasoning does not withstand analysis with respect to one of these federal statutes \u2014 the FTC Act.\nThe Federal Trade Commission, in an amicus curiae brief filed in this case, correctly points out that section 5 of the FTC Act, in its application to both antitrust enforcement and consumer protection, has been given a broad and flexible interpretation. This was certainly the intent of Congress. The House Conference Report that accompanied the original passage of the FTC Act states:\n\u201cIt is impossible to frame definitions which embrace all unfair practices. There is no limit to human inventiveness in this field. Even if all known unfair practices were specifically defined and prohibited, it would be at once necessary to begin over again. If Congress were to adopt the method of definition, it would undertake an endless task.\u201d\nH.R.Conf.Rep.No.1142, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 19 (1914). See also S.Rep.No.597, 63d Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1914). The United States Supreme Court has consistently followed the congressional mandate that section 5 be applied broadly to whatever business conduct injured either competitor or consumer. E. g., FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 405 U.S. 233, 92 S.Ct. 898, 31 L.Ed.2d 170 (1972); FTC v. Brown Shoe Co., 384 U.S. 316, 320-321, 86 S.Ct. 1501, 1504, 16 L.Ed.2d 587 (1966); FTC v. Motion Picture Advertising Service Co., 344 U.S. 392, 394, 73 S.Ct. 361, 363, 97 L.Ed. 426 (1953); FTC v. Cement Institute, 333 U.S. 683, 693, 68 S.Ct. 793, 799-800, 92 L. Ed. 1010 (1948); FTC v. R. F. Keppel & Brothers, Inc., 291 U.S. 304, 310, 54 S.Ct. 423, 425, 78 L.Ed. 814 (1934).\nIn FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., the Supreme Court was recently pressed to decide, inter alia, whether section 5 of the FTC Act empowered \u201cthe Commission to proscribe practices as unfair or deceptive in their effect upon consumers regardless of their nature or quality as competitive practices or their effect upon competition?\u201d 405 U.S. at 239, 92 S.Ct. at 903. After a detailed review of legislative history and earlier decisions, that Court squarely held:\n\u201cThus, legislative and judicial authorities alike convince us that the Federal Trade Commission does not arrogate excessive power to itself if, in measuring a practice against the elusive, but congressionally mandated standard of fairness, it, like a court of equity, considers public values beyond simply those enshrined in the letter or encompassed in the spirit of the antitrust laws.\u201d\nId. at 244, 92 S.Ct. at 905 (footnote omitted). That section 5 of the FTC Act was meant as an adaptable tool for protection of the public interest cannot be denied.\nDespite the remedial nature of and expansive interpretation given to section 5, the Commonwealth Court implied an exception from the coverage of section 5 because it could find \u201cno mention of the rental of real property.\u201d This conclusion led the Commonwealth Court ineluctably to its holding that the Consumer Protection Law did not cover leasing.\nWe have seen, however, that Congress chose not to delineate precisely the type of unfair and deceptive practices outlawed; rather, it gave the Commission a deliberately flexible standard. FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 405 U.S. at 239-240, 92 S.Ct. at 903. It is altogether inconsistent with the congressional intent that section 5 be a broad, all-inclusive trade regulation statute, to imply an exception for leases. Moreover, the argument that no specific mention is made of leasing really cuts the other way, in view of Congress\u2019 explicitness when it desired to make an exception from the jurisdiction of section 5. See 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 45 (a) (6) (1963).\nAlso, there are numerous cases under section 5 in which the Commission sought to enjoin unfair and deceptive methods in connection with the leasing of property. E. g., Atlantic Refining Co. v. FTC, 381 U.S. 357, 363 n. 5, 85 S.Ct. 1498, 1503 n.5, 14 L.Ed.2d 443 (1965); FTC v. Paramount Famous-Lasky Cory., 57 F.2d 152 (2d Cir. 1932); Sinclair Refining Co. v. FTC, 276 F. 686 (7th Cir. 1921); Canfield Oil Co. v. FTC, 274 F. 571 (6th Cir. 1921); Standard Oil Co. of New York v. FTC, 273 F. 478 (2d Cir. 1921). Aside from judicial decisions, administrative proceedings initiated by the Commission have resulted in section 5 jurisdiction over leases. E. g., Grand Caillou Packing Co., 65 F.T.C. 799 (1964), aff\u2019d in part and rev\u2019d in part sub. nom. LaPeyre v. FTC, 366 F. 2d 117 (5th Cir. 1966); Pure Carbonic, Inc., 44 F.T.C. 1029 (1948); Linen Supply Board of Trade of New Jersey, 36 F.T.C. 382 (1943); Kaumagraph Co., 20 F.T.C. 1 (1934). Recently, the Commission has accepted consent orders against the operator and several large merchant-tenants of a shopping center who had entered into leases giving the merchants power to control the stores which could rent space in the center. Gimbel Brothers, Inc., F.T.C. Dkt. No. 8885 (filed May 8,1972). And it has proceeded against deception and unfairness in the sale of land. GAC Corp., F.T.C. File No. 722, 3187, F.T.C. Press Release (Mar. 26, 1974). Action has also been taken to enjoin the advertising of rental housing subject to a policy of racial discrimination. First Buckingham Community, Inc., 73 F.T.C. 938 (1968).\nNo support in the federal precursors of the Consumer Protection Law can be found for an exclusion for leasing from the Law\u2019s broad prohibition of unfair and deceptive practices in market transactions. On the other hand, the legislative history of, decisions interpreting, and FTC proceedings under section 5 of the FTC Act strongly counsel that the leasing of housing is covered by the Consumer Protection Law.\nD\nAppellees apparently recognize that the flexible and all-inclusive language of section 3 of the Consumer Protection Law does not favor their constrictive interpretation. They then base their argument on a much narrower question of legislative intent: whether leasing is included in the statutory definition of \u201ctrade or commerce.\u201d The Consumer Protection Law states that those words\n\u201cmean the advertising, offering for sale, sale or distribution of any services and any property, tangible or intangible, real, personal or mixed, and any other article, commodity, or thing of value wherever situate, and includes any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this Commonwealth.\u201d\n73 P.S. \u00a7201-2(3) (1971).\nThe initial lesson revealed by this definition is contained in the command that trade and commerce \u201cincludes any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this Commonwealth.\u201d The legislative intent gleaned from these words is again certain\u2014 the statute is to be liberally construed.\nThe statutory definition of trade or commerce also refines the issue. Our only task is to see whether the Consumer Protection Law covers leasing. If leasing is covered, the Law in plain terms applies to the leasing of \u201cproperty, tangible or intangible, real, personal, or mixed.\u201d This comprehensive definition clearly includes residential property.\nAppellees strenuously argue that the leasing of residences does not meet the statutory test of \u201csale or distribution of . any property.\u201d This argument prevailed in the Commonwealth Court because that court believed \u201cit is significant that the Legislature, having indicated its complete understanding of the word 'lease\u2019, omitted that term from any provision in the Act before us.\u201d 10 Pa.Cmwlth. at 608, 314 A.2d at 338. The absence of a word in a statute, however, does not properly end the inquiry but rather serves as the starting point of analysis. The words of the statute not being free of all ambiguity, we must ascertain the Legislature\u2019s intent by considering other indicia of that intent. See 1 Pa. S. \u00a7 1921 (b) (Special Pamphlet, 1973).\nWe hold that the leasing of residences falls within the ambit of the Consumer Protection Law. Our holding has its seat in several sources: the contemporary view, expressed in numerous decisions, of residential leases; traditional common-law conceptions of the lease; the modern, pragmatic and functional approach of the Legislature when attempting to solve societal problems; and the consequences of a holding to the contrary.\ni\nAs adumbrated earlier, the Consumer Protection Law was designed to equalize the market position and strength of the consumer vis-a-vis the seller. A perception of unfairness led the Legislature to regulate more closely market transactions. The mischief to be remedied was the use of unfair or deceptive acts and practices by sellers. As part of the Law\u2019s object, fraudulent conduct that would mislead or confuse a consumer was banned.\nFunctionally viewed, the modern apartment dweller is a consumer of housing services. The contemporary leasing of residences envisions one person (landlord) exchanging for periodic payments of money (rent) a bundle of goods and services, rights and obligations. The now-classic description \u00f3f this economic reality appears in Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 138 U.S.App.D.C. 369, 428 F.2d 1071, 1074, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 91 S.Ct. 186, 27 L.Ed.2d 185 (1970) (footnote omitted).\n\u201cWhen American city dwellers, both rich and poor, seek \u2018shelter\u2019 today, they seek a well known package of goods and services \u2014 a package which includes not merely walls and ceilings, but also adequate heat, light and ventilation, serviceable plumbing facilities, secure windows and doors, proper sanitation, and proper maintenance.\u201d\nAccord, Steele v. Latimer, 214 Kan. 329, 334, 521 P.2d 304, 309-310 (1974); King v. Moorehead, 495 S.W.2d 65, 70 (Mo.App.1973); Foisy v. Wyman, 83 Wash.2d 22, 27, 515 P.2d 160, 164 (1973); cf. Kline v. Burns, 111 N.H. 87, 91, 276 A.2d 248, 251 (1971). See generally Friedman on Leases \u00a7 1.1, at 5 (1974).\nThe purchaser of this bundle (tenant) is as much a consumer as is the purchaser of an automobile, household appliance, or any other consumer good. This much was unanimously recognized by the Supreme Court of California.\n\u201cIn most significant respects, the modern urban tenant is in the same position as any other normal consumer of goods. . . . Through a residential lease, a tenant seeks to purchase \u2018housing\u2019 from his landlord for a specified period of time [and] [t]he landlord \u2018sells\u2019 housing . . ..\u201d\nGreen v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616, 627, 111 Cal. Rptr. 704, 711, 517 P.2d 1168, 1175 (1974) (citation omitted); accord, Mease v. Fox, Iowa, 200 N.W.2d 791, 793 (1972). See generally Schoshinski, Remedies of the Indigent Tenant: Proposal for Change, 54 Geo.L.J. 519 (1966); Note, The Tenant as a Consumer, 3 U.C.Davis L.Rev. 59 (1971). And from the landlord\u2019s vantage, the marketing and distribution of the bundle increasingly follows methods mapped out by purveyors of modern consumer goods. Cf. Smith v. Old Warson Development Co., 479 S.W.2d 795 (Mo.1972); Schipper v. Levitt & Sons, Inc., 44 N.J. 70, 90, 207 A.2d 314, 325 (1965).\nWe agree with the Supreme Court of New Jersey in Schipper, that\n\u201c[i]n the developing steps toward higher consumer and user protection through higher trade morality and responsibility, the law should view trade relations realistically rather than mythically.\u201d\n44 N.J. at 99, 207 A.2d at 330 (1965). Accord, Mease v. Fox, Iowa, 200 N.W.2d 791, 794 (1972); Steele v. Latimer, 214 Kan. 329, 333, 521 P.2d 304, 308 (1974); 6 S. Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \u00a7 890A (3d ed. 1962). These words ring particularly true in the context of construing remedial legislation designed to correct imbalances in the marketplace. See, e. g., FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., supra; SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, 375 U.S. 180, 195, 84 S.Ct. 275, 284-285, 11 L.Ed.2d 237 (1963) (Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 80b-l to 80b-21 (1971), to be liberally construed); Goodman v. FTC, 244 F.2d 584, 590-591 (9th Cir. 1957) (\u00a7 5 of FTC Act).\nWe cannot presume that the Legislature when attempting to control unfair and deceptive practices in the conduct of trade or commerce intended to be strictly bound by common-law formalisms. Rather the more natural inference is that the Legislature intended the Consumer Protection Law to be given a pragmatic reading \u2014 a reading consistent with modern day economic reality. That pragmatic reading dictates that purchasers of rental housing be treated as consumers and, therefore, within the class of persons sought to be protected by the Consumer Protection Law.\nli\nMoreover, there is substantial common-law authority that the leasing of property is identical to the sale of the premises. Dean Prosser accurately states the general rule:\n\u201cWhen land is leased to a tenant, the law of property regards the lease as equivalent to a sale of the premises for the term.\u201d\nW. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts \u00a7 63, at 399 (4th ed. 1971) (footnote omitted). Support for this proposition goes back at least to 1809 when the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts stated that \u201ca lease for years is a sale of the demised premises for the term; and [t]he rent is in effect the price, or purchase money, to be paid for the ownership of the premises during the term . . ..\u201d Fowler v. Bolt, 6 Mass. 63, 67 (1809). And in this Commonwealth, at least one court has come to the identical conclusion.\n\u201cA lease is a sale and conveyance of the property leased, which only differs from what is commonly called a deed, in being limited to a term certain, and leaving a reversionary interest in the grantor. . . From the moment of letting, the land becomes the tenant\u2019s, and remains such until the lease terminates; the house, if there be one, is his castle\nWien v. Simpson, 2 Phila. 158, (Pa.Dist.Ct.1858). Accord, Fetters v. City of Des Moines, 260 Iowa 490, 495, 149 N.W.2d 815, 819-820 (1967); Abby v. Billups, 35 Miss. 618, 630 (1858) (\u201cA lease for years is a bargain and sale of the demised premises.\u201d) ; Warner v. Fry, 360 Mo. 496, 228 S.W.2d 729 (1950); Sylvester Watts Smyth Realty Co. v. American Surety Co., 292 Mo. 423, 436, 238 S.W. 494, 498 (1921). Longi v. Raymond-Commerce Corp., 34 N.J.Super. 593, 600, 113 A.2d 69, 72 (App.Div. 1955).\nCourts of other jurisdictions have considered leases as the sale of an interest in real estate, e. g., Brenner v. Spiegle, 116 Ohio St. 631, 632, 157 N.E. 491, 492-493 (1927), or as the \u201csale of the possession, occupancy and profits of land for a term.\u201d Thiokol Chemical Corp. v. Morris County Board of Taxation, 41 N.J. 405, 416, 197 A.2d 176, 182 (1964). Still other courts recognize that the lessee\u2019s interest is tantamount to absolute ownership of the premises for the term. E. g., Baker v.

In Offutt Housing Co. v. County of Sarpy, 351 U.S. 253, 261-262, 76 S.Ct. 814, 819-820, 100 L.Ed. 1151 (1956), that Court held, inter alia, that an agency of the state could constitutionally tax a lessee on the full value of buildings and improvements, despite the lessor\u2019s obvious retention of title, where the lease was for 75 years and the estimated useful life of buildings and improvements was 35 years.\nIt is certainly the modern understanding of the common law of leases that \u201c[a] tenant is a purchaser of an estate in land . . ..\u201d Pines v. Perssion, 14 Wis.2d 590, 594, 111 N.W.2d 409, 412 (1961). Accord, Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 138 U.S.App.D.C. 369, 428 F.2d 1071, 1079, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 91 S.Ct. 186, 27 L.Ed.2d 185 (1970) ; Green v.

Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184,-, 293 N.E.2d 831, 841-843 (1973).\nThese former decisions on the nature of the landlord-tenant relationship, see 1 Pa. S. \u00a7 1921(c)(5). (Special Pamphlet, 1973), help guide us to the conclusion that the business of leasing housing services is covered by the Consumer Protection Law.\niii\nWe are not unmindful that in elegantia juris a sale requires the passing of title. The argument runs from this observation that since a lease transfers only possession, not title, a lease cannot be a sale.\nWhatever vitality the concept of title has elsewhere in the law, we think it unimportant in the context of the Consumer Protection Law. Hinging the remedies of the Consumer Protection Law on the passing of title simply fails to reflect fairly both modern economic conditions and, more importantly, the Legislature\u2019s intent.\nIt is plain, too, that section 5 of the FTC Act (see text accompanying notes 12-18 supra), has been applied without regard to the form in which a transaction was couched. Licenses, franchises, and leases have all been subject to section 5 jurisdiction. The company\u2019s purported retention of title over trading stamps in FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Co., 405 U.S. 233, 238, 92 S.Ct. 898, 902, 31 L.Ed.2d 170 (1972), did not affect the Commission\u2019s power to proceed against the alleged violations in that case. A sale, in the traditional sense, is unnecessary to trigger the applicability of the FTC Act.\nIn this regard, however, the Commonwealth Court was impressed that the Uniform Commercial Code defines sale in terms of \u201cthe passing of title.\u201d 12A P.S. \u00a7 2-106(1) (1970). But it must be recognized that the UCC is not tied to a rigid, formalistic view of title. See generally id. \u00a7 2-401 (1970). For instance, a sale within the UCC\u2019s meaning will occur even if the seller formally retains title. Assuming a functional stance (as we do instantly), the UCC treats this retention of title, absent a contrary intent, as the reservation of a security interest. Id. \u00a7 2-401(1) (1970). Thus, the UCC\u2019s modern statement of contract law views the buyer-seller relationship pragmatically and avoids undue adherence to older formalisms. Indeed, the very purpose of the UCC was to end the nineteenth century\u2019s overly formalistic approach to contract law.\nMore fundamentally, that the Legislature in enacting the UCC found it convenient to adopt a particular definition of sale in order to further its view of commercial reasonableness does not begin to answer the question of legislative intent now before us. To woodenly apply the UCC\u2019s definition of sale to the Consumer Protection Law would not only defeat the Law\u2019s remedial objects, but, ironically, would be contrary to the spirit of the UCC. We do not say that the common-law distinction between title and possession is for all purposes irrelevant, but only that the definition of trade and commerce in the Consumer Protection Law is not bound by this distinction.\nIV\nIn reaching our result we are especially solicitous of the consequences of a contrary interpretation. See 1 Pa. S. \u00a7 1921(c)(6) (Special Pamphlet, 1973). We have seen that the Consumer Protection Law was designed to end unfairness and deception in consumer transactions with the result that consumers would be placed on a more equal footing with sellers. And this Law was meant to apply to \u201cany trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this Commonwealth.\u201d 73 P.S. \u00a7201-2(3) (Supp.1971).\nIt would be difficult indeed to imagine anything that affects the lives and welfare of the people of this Commonwealth more than housing. The Legislature has repeatedly declared that this Commonwealth suffers from a housing crisis. In 1937, 1941, 1945, 1947, 1957, 1959, 1965, 1968, and 1972 the Legislature found as a fact that a housing shortage exists. See Johnson v. Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency, 453 Pa. 329, 332-335, 337-338, 309 A.2d 528, 530-531, 532-533 (1973).\nThis Court has independently acknowledged the existence of a crisis caused by the lack of suitable housing. Klein v. Allegheny County Health Department, 441 Pa. 1, 7, 269 A.2d 647, 651 (1970); Reitmeyer v. Sprecher, 431 Pa. 284, 289-290, 243 A.2d 395, 398 (1968); cf. Galligan v. Arovitch, 421 Pa. 301, 304, 219 A.2d 463, 465 (1966). The words of Chief Justice, then Justice Jones accurately describe the economic plight of the modern residential tenant.\n\u201cWe must recognize the fact that, since the time when Harris [v. Lewistown Trust Co., 326 Pa. 145, 191 A. 34 (1937)] was decided, critical changes have taken place economically and socially. Aware of such changes, we must realize further that most frequently today the average prospective tenant vis-a-vis the prospective landlord occupies a disadvantageous position. Stark necessity very often forces a tenant into occupancy of premises far from desirable and in a defective state of repair. The acute housing shortage mandates that the average prospective tenant accede to the demands of the prospective landlord as to conditions of rental, which, under ordinary conditions with housing available, the average tenant would not and should not accept.\n\u201cNo longer does the average prospective tenant occupy a free bargaining status and no longer do the average landlord-to-be and tenant-to-be negotiate a lease on an \u2018arm\u2019s length\u2019 basis. Premises which, under normal circumstances, would be completely unattractive for rental are now, by necessity, at a premium. If our law is to keep in tune with our times we must recognize the present day inferior position of the average tenant vis-a-vis the landlord when it comes to negotiating a lease.\u201d\nReitmeyer v. Sprecher, 431 Pa. at 289-290, 243 A.2d at 398.\nOther jurisdictions have taken judicial notice of the contemporary shortage of residential housing and the unequal bargaining power of landlords and tenants. E. g., Javins v. First National Realty Corp., 138 U.S. App.D.C. 369, 428 F.2d 1071, 1079-1080, cert. denied, 400 U.S. 925, 91 S.Ct. 186, 27 L.Ed.2d 185 (1970); Green v. Superior Court, 10 Cal.3d 616, 625, 111 Cal. Rptr. 704, 709-710, 517 P.2d 1168, 1173-1174 (1974); Lemle v. Breeden, 51 Haw. 426, 428, 462 P.2d 470, 472-473 (1969); Mease v.

Burns, 111 N.H. 87, 91, 276 A.2d 248, 251 (1971); Marini v. Ireland, 56 N.J. 130, 141, 145, 265 A.2d 526, 532-533, 535 (1970); Reste Realty Corp. v. Cooper, 53 N.J. 444, 452, 251 A.2d 268, 272 (1968). See also Tucker v. Crawford, 315 A.2d 737, 741 (Del.Super.1974); Jack Springs, Inc. v. Little, 50 Ill.2d 351, 280 N.E.2d 208 (1972) ; Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, 363 Mass. 184, \u2014, 293 N.E.2d 831, 841-842 (1973); Foisy v. Wyman, 83 Wash.2d 22, 26, 515 P.2d 160, 163-165 (1973) ; Pines v. Perssion, 14 Wis.2d 590, 596, 111 N.W. 2d 409, 413 (1961).\nThe housing crisis has not escaped national attention. Congress in 1949 expressed its concern over the lack of adequate housing, and an inadequate housing supply is still a serious national problem. Cases implying the significance of housing-related disputes and of attempted solutions to landlord-tenant problems have increasingly reached the Supreme Court. And executive studies have nearly unanimously found that better housing is critical to the improvement of the urban social environment.\nAgainst this background, the Consumer Protection Law was passed. Fully aware of the pressing need for adequate housing and the unequal economic position of landlord and tenant, the Legislature sought to end unfairness and deception in the conduct of trade or commerce. To refuse to apply the Consumer Protection Law to the leasing of residential housing would needlessly insulate a great percentage of market transactions from the Law\u2019s salutary antifraud provisions. Only by exalting form over substance could such a course be pursued.\nThe Legislature directed that consumers were to be safeguarded by the Consumer Protection Law. As earlier explained, tenants are in every meaningful sense consumers. By holding the leasing of housing is covered by the Consumer Protection Law, this Court faithfully gives effect to the legislative mandate. \u25a0\nII\nIt is also maintained that the alleged wrongful acts and omissions of the landlord appellees are not \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices\u201d within the meaning of section 3 of the Consumer Protection Law. The Commonwealth proceeded on the theory that the alleged unlawful action of appellees was covered by the statutory proscription against\n\u201cany other fraudulent conduct which creates a likelihood of confusion or of misunderstanding.\u201d\n73 P.S. \u00a7 201-2(4) (xiii) (1971). It argues that this section was designed to cover generally all unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of trade or commerce. We agree.\nThe Legislature realized, as has often been stated, that no sooner is one fraud specifically defined and outlawed than another variant of it appears. Rather than restricting courts and the enforcing authorities solely to narrowly specified types of unfair and deceptive practices, the Legislature wisely declared unlawful \u201cany other fraudulent conduct.\u201d This is a common and well-accepted legislative response to the mischief caused by unfair and deceptive market practices.\nAppellees counter this interpretation of the Consumer Protection Law by an appeal to the doctrine of ejusdem generis, which simply means,\n\u201c \u2018General expressions used in a statute are restricted to things and persons similar to those specifically enumerated in the language preceding the general expressions. . . . \u2019 \u201d\nButler Fair & Agricultural Association v. Butler School District, 389 Pa. 169, 178, 132 A.2d 214, 219 (1957) (quoting Frederick\u2019s Estate, 333 Pa. 327, 331, 5 A.2d 91, 93 (1939)). However, as this Court has long recognized, \u201c[t]his rule is but one of construction and does not warrant a court in confining the operation of a statute within narrower limits than intended by the Legislature.\u201d Commonwealth v. Klucher, 326 Pa. 587, 590, 193 A. 28, 29 (1937). See 2A J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction \u00a7 47.22 (C. Sands ed. 1973).\nTo hold that the general antifraud provision of section 2(4) (xiii) is bound by the specifically-enumerated examples of unfair conduct (\u00a7 2(4)(i) to (xii)) would plainly thwart the legislative intent. Such a holding would negative the Legislature\u2019s understanding that \u201cFraud is infinite\u201d and would allow the broad prohibition of section 3 to be \u201celuded by new schemes which the fertility of man\u2019s invention would contrive.\u201d See note 42 supra. This we will not do.\nIll\nThe Commonwealth additionally alleges that four printing companies by the printing of form leases for appellee landlords have violated, and are violating, the Consumer Protection Law. The form sellers demurred, saying that their assertedly unlawful actions were protected by the first amendment to the United States Constitution and by Article 1, section 7 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, P.S. For reasons different from those offered by appellee form sellers, we agree that on this record they cannot be enjoined under the Consumer Protection Law from printing form leases.\nIn our view, the Legislature\u2019s intent compels this result. \u201cWhen the validity of an act of the [Legislature] is drawn in question, and if a serious doubt of constitutionality is raised, it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain whether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the [constitutional] question may be avoided.\u201d Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62, 52 S.Ct. 285, 296, 76 L.Ed. 598 (1932) (footnote omitted). See Johnson v. Robison, 415 U.S. 361, 365, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 1165, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974); United States v. Thirty-Seven Photographs, 402 U.S. 363, 369, 91 S.Ct. 1400, 1404, 28 L.Ed.2d 822 (1971) (plurality opinion).\nHere, section 3 of the Consumer Protection Law, as earlier noted, broadly declares unlawful all \u201cunfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\u201d But immediately following this declaration, the Legislature excluded from the Law\u2019s scope the actions of printers who act \u201cin good faith and without knowledge of the falsity or deceptive character\u201d of what they print. 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-3 (1971).\nIt is certain that the Legislature intended that those who perform the mechanical act of setting type cannot be held liable vicariously for the misrepresentations of those who ordered the printing. This is precisely the instant case. Nothing appears in the record that would indicate that the role of the printers is anything other than mechanical. The Commonwealth has alleged neither that the printers did not act in good faith nor that they had any knowledge of the alleged false and deceptive character of the lease provisions. Thus, as pleaded, the printing of form leases is the sort of mechanical act excepted from the coverage of the Consumer Protection Law.\nIV\nAppellees also filed preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. Even though the Commonwealth Court decided that the Consumer Protection Law did not apply to the leasing of residences, it went on to consider appellees\u2019 demurrer. That court treated appellees as if there were a single defendant demurring to the Commonwealth\u2019s complaint. It held that the Commonwealth failed to state a cause of action.\nA demurrer admits as true all well-pleaded facts and all inferences reasonably deducible from them, but not any conclusions of law. Reardon v. Wilbur, 441 Pa. 551, 554, 272 A.2d 888, 890 (1971); Clevenstein v. Rizzuto, 439 Pa. 397, 400-401, 266 A.2d 623, 624-625 (1970); Hoffman v. Misericordia Hospital, 439 Pa. 501, 503-504, 267 A.2d 867, 868 (1970). Only if \u201cupon the facts averred, the law says with certainty that no recovery is permitted,\u201d Clevenstein, supra, 439 Pa. at 401, 266 A.2d at 625, will this Court sustain the demurrer. \u201cWhere a doubt exists as to whether a demurrer should be sustained, this should be resolved in favor of overruling it.\u201d Id.; see King v. United States Steel Corp., 432 Pa. 140, 143-144, 247 A.2d 563, 565 (1968).\nAlthough the Commonwealth Court concluded that no cause of action had been stated, it did not consider the Commonwealth\u2019s allegation of misleading conduct created by the use of leases with \u201carchaic and technical language beyond the easy comprehension of the consumer of average intelligence.\u201d Because the hearing court did not pass on whether the Commonwealth set forth a cause of action with respect to this claim, we cannot say that no recovery is possible. Accordingly, we remand to the Commonwealth Court for it to rule on this allegation.\nThat court did pass on the Commonwealth\u2019s remaining claims for relief. It was also alleged that the use of lease provisions which \u201care illegal, unconscionable and unconstitutional and hence unenforceable\u201d violated the Consumer Protection Law. The gravamen of this alleged violation is that the use of lease clauses which are unenforceable because of either legislation or judicial decision is misleading to the consumer of housing services. As pleaded, the predicate for the Commonwealth\u2019s theory is that the provisions are unenforceable in all circumstances. The Commonwealth Court assiduously reviewed the existing law of this and other jurisdictions, 10 Pa. Cmwlth. at 611-615, 314 A.2d at 340-342, and came to the conclusion that it was unable to \u201cdetermine as a matter of law that the clauses generally described by the Commonwealth in its complaint are in fact unlawful or unconstitutional.\u201d Id. at 615, 314 A.2d at 342 (footnote omitted). Phrased alternatively, that court concluded that the law was settled that these provisions were not unenforceable in all circumstances. We agree with the Commonwealth Court\u2019s analysis of the existing law, and of necessity with its conclusion that this allegation, as pleaded, failed to state a cause of action.\nThe Commonwealth Court next addressed the claim that the landlords\u2019 failure to inform tenants in the leases of the existence of statutory tenant remedies constituted an unfair or misleading practice. The sole reference to this allegation is the statement of the Commonwealth Court that\n\u201cwe can find no law which would require a landlord to notify a tenant of his rights under The Landlord and Tenant Act.\u201d\n10 Pa.Cmwlth. at 616,314 A.2d at 342.\nThis assertion misperceives the issue, however. The question is whether the Consumer Protection Law requires a landlord to notify a tenant in a lease of the tenant\u2019s statutory rights, because allegedly the absence of this notification is misleading or confusing to the tenant as consumer of housing services.\nOne of our trial courts has already held that the Consumer Protection Law contemplates that in \u201cappropriate circumstances, a court may require affirmative disclosures by a seller to prevent misrepresentation and deception . . . .\u201d Commonwealth v. Foster, 57 Pa.D. & C.2d 203, 208 (C.P. Allegheny County 1972). This holding is completely in accord with the federal view that section 5 of the FTC Act authorizes affirmative disclosure if the absence of such disclosure is misleading to the consumer.\nMoreover, the common law of misrepresentation clearly envisions that the omission of a material fact may be actionable. As long ago as 1877, this Court stated, \u201cIt needs no citation of authorities to prove that the wilful . . . concealment of a material fact by the vendor constitutes a fraud.\u201d Krumbhaar v. Birch, 83 Pa. 426, 428 (1877). Accord, Scaife Co. v. Rockwell-Standard Corp., 446 Pa. 280, 285-86, 285 A.2d 451, 454 (1971), cert. denied, 407 U.S. 920, 92 S.Ct. 2459, 32 L. Ed.2d 806 (1972); Neuman v. Corn Exchange National Bank & Trust Co., 356 Pa. 442, 51 A.2d 759, supplemented per curiam, 52 A.2d 177 (1947); Croyle v. Moses, 90 Pa. 250, 252 (1879); Rheem v. Naugatuck Wheel Co., 33 Pa. 358, 365 (1859) (suppression of material fact); Cor nelius v. Molloy, 7 Pa. 293, 296 (1847) (\u201cunder peculiar circumstances, even silence will be deemed a fraud\u201d). See generally, 1 F. Harper & F. James, The Law of Torts \u00a77.14 (1956).\nDean Prosser writes that the common law developed the rule that\n\u201cthe lessor, like a vendor, is under the obligation to disclose to the lessee concealed dangerous conditions existing when possession is transferred, of which he has knowledge. There is \u2018something like fraud\u2019 in a failure to give warning of a known hidden danger to one who enters upon the assumption that it does not exist; and the lessor will be liable to the lessee or to members of his family for his non-disclosures.\u201d\nW. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts 401 (4th ed. 1971) (footnotesomitted).\nRecently, the Supreme Court of Indiana applied this principle to a situation analogous to the present case. Weaver v. American Oil Co., 257 Ind. 458, 276 N.E.2d 144 (1971). There, a landlord-oil company used a printed form lease \u201cwhich contained, in addition to the normal leasing provisions, a \u2018hold harmless\u2019 clause which provided in substance that the leasee [sic] operator would hold harmless and also indemnify the oil company for any negligence of the oil company occurring on the leased premises.\u201d 257 Ind. at 459, 276 N.E.2d at 145. The lessee-filling station operator was injured on the leased premises by an employee of the oil company. The Indiana court refused to enforce the lease provision. In so holding, that court in effect treated the lease as a commodity and placed on the landlord with super bargaining power the responsibility of impliedly warranting the fitness of the lease.\n\u201cThe burden should be on the party submitting such \u2018a package\u2019 [i. e., a standardized mass contract] in printed form to show that the other party had knowledge of any unusual or unconscionable terms contained therein. The principle should be the same as that applicable to implied warranties, namely that a package of goods sold to a purchaser is fit for the purposes intended and contains no harmful materials other than that represented. Caveat lessee is no more the current law than caveat emptor. .\n. The party seeking to enforce such a contract has the burden of showing that the provisions were explained to the other party and came to Ms knowledge and there was in fact a real and voluntary meeting of the minds and not merely an objective meeting.\u201d\n257 Ind. at 464, 276 N.E.2d at 147-148 (emphasis in original).\nThis holding is in harmony with Dean Prosser\u2019s view of the future path of the common law.\n\u201cThe law appears to be working toward the ultimate conclusion that full disclosure of all material facts must be made whenever elementary fair conduct demands it.\u201d\nW. Prosser, Handbook of the Law of Torts 698 (4th ed. 1971) (footnoteomitted).\nThese authorities undermine the Commonwealth Court\u2019s opinion that no law exists requiring affirmative disclosure of the tenant\u2019s statutory rights. However, rather than considering on this stark record whether the Commonwealth pleaded a cause of action with respect to its claim of misleading failure to disclose, we believe the wiser appellate course is to remand to the Commonwealth Court. In this fashion, the hearing court will have the opportunity to pass fully on this claim and establish a record adequate for its determination and for appellate review. We believe the procedural situation is analogous to one in which a trial court employs an incorrect standard; our practice there is to remand for further proceedings in light of the appropriate standard. This procedure makes especially good sense here since a remand is already required due to the failure of the Commonwealth Court to rule on the \u201carchaic language\u201d claim.\nV\nFinally, the Commonwealth Court held that it was not authorized to order the relief requested by the Commonwealth. We think, however, it premature at this stage of the proceedings to reach this question.\nOn remand all properly-preserved preliminary objections except the question of the jurisdictional reach of the Consumer Protection Law will be open.\nThat portion of the order of the Commonwealth Court that dismissed the Commonwealth\u2019s complaint for failure to state a cause of action with respect to the use of \u201cunenforceable\u201d lease provisions is affirmed. For reasons different than those advanced by the Commonwealth Court, that portion of its order dismissing the complaint with respect to the form sellers is also affirmed. In all other respects the order is vacated and the case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which JONES, C. J., joins.\n. The Commonwealth\u2019s complaint explicitly refers to The Landlord and Tenant Act of 1951, Act of April 6, 1951, P.L. 69, \u00a7\u00a7 101-602, as amended, 68 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 250.101 to 250.602 (1965 & Supp. 1974).\n. E. g., 68 P.S. \u00a7 250.512 (Supp.1974). The Legislature specifically provided in \u00a7 250.512 (titled \u201cRecovery of improperly held escrow funds\u201d) that \u201c[a]ny attempted waiver of this section by a tenant by contract or otherwise shall be void and unenforceable.\u201d Id. \u00a7 250.512(d) (Supp.1974).\n. The Commonwealth Court also did not rule on whether the Commonwealth had an adequate remedy at law.\nAlthough passing mention is made in that court\u2019s written opinion of the procedure used by the Commonwealth, 10 Pa.Cmwlth. at 600-603, 616-617, 314 A.2d 334-336, 342 (passim), the court never ruled on any of the procedural questions raised, id., but rather explicitly based its order on its \u201cholding that the complaint fails to state a cause of action.\u201d Id. at 617, 314 A.2d at 342. That this was the sole basis of that court\u2019s order cannot be denied. Id. at 618-619, 314 A.2d at 343.\nThe Commonwealth Court did state in dictum that \u201cthe approach utilized by the Attorney General is improper,\u201d id. at 604, 314 A.2d at 336, but this comment referred to the Commonwealth\u2019s request for relief. Although every request for relief in the Commonwealth\u2019s complaint (except for the paragraph asking for \u201csuch other relief as this Court deems necessary or proper or just\u201d) is written in terms of the \u201cdefendants\u2019 \u201d conduct, the Commonwealth Court viewed the prayer as too broad on the theory that the Commonwealth was seeking to bind nonparties. Id.\nWe cannot agree with the hearing court\u2019s observation that section 6 of the Consumer Protection Law \u201cprovides an exclusive and effective means for the Attorney General to investigate, obtain information and discover facts prior to the bringing of a lawsuit under the [Consumer Protection Law] . . Id. at 601, 314 A.2d at 335. See 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-6 (1971). The language of section 6 is plainly directory, not mandatory. It was not meant to totally displace other discovery permitted by our Rules of Civil Procedure.\n. Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 203, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.203 (Supp.1974). Section 203 provides in pertinent part:\n\u201cThe Supreme Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from all final orders of the Commonwealth Court entered in any matter which was originally commenced in said court and which does not constitute an appeal from another court, an administrative agency or a justice of the peace.\u201d\n. There is no indication of an intent to exclude a class or classes of transactions from the ambit of the Consumer Protection Law. When the Legislature deemed it necessary to make an exception from the Law\u2019s scope, it did so in clear language. A single, general exception was made for printers and others similarly situated who act \u201cin good faith and without knowledge of the falsity or deceptive character\u201d of what they print. 73 P.S. \u00a7 201-3 (1971).

Indeed, as Justice Story wrote in 1844 for the Supreme Court of the United States:\n\u201cIn one sense, every law imposing a penalty or a forfeiture may be deemed a penal law; in another sense, such laws are deemed, and truly deserve to be called, remedial. The judge was therefore strictly accurate, when he stated that \u2018it must not be understood that every law which imposes a penalty is, therefore, legally speaking, a penal law, that is, a law which is to be construed with great strictness in favor of the defendant. Laws enacted for the prevention of fraud, for the suppression of a public wrong, or to effect a public good, are not in the strict sense, penal acts, although they may inflict a penalty for violating them.\u2019 \u201d\nTaylor v.
