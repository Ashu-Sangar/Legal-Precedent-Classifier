Because the Commonwealth Court substituted its own assessments of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses for that of the Unemployment Compensation Review Board\u2019s (\u201cUCBR\u201d), the judgment of the Commonwealth Court is REVERSED, and the determination of the UCBR is reinstated. See Peak v. UCBR, 509 Pa. 267, 501 A.2d 1383 (1985) (holding that the UCBR is \u201cthe ultimate finder of fact\u201d and it is not an appellate court\u2019s function to balance the evidence; questions of credibility, and the resolution of evidentiary conflicts are not subject to reevaluation upon appellate review).\nChief Justice SAYLOR files a dissenting statement in which Justice DOUGHERTY joins."}
