{"id": "1084453", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nDefendant petitioned the court below to open a confessed judgment, which it refused to do; defendant then entered a rule to strike off tlie judgment, and, on its discharge, took the present appeal.\nThe record before us shows all the proceedings leading up to the orders above stated, but defendant assigns for error only the refusal to strike off, finding no fault with the refusal to open the judgment.\nIn the petition to open, defendant admits it \u201centered into\u201d the contract containing the warrant by virtue of which the judgment was confessed, alleging, however, that it was not in default \u201cunder the terms of said agreement,\u201d and adding, it was ready to \u201ccarry out its part of said agreement.\u201d Furthermore, defendant attached to this petition, what it averred- to be a \u201ctrue and correct copy\u201d of the agreement in question, and this shows a contract in writing duly executed by plaintiff, her husband (since deceased), and defendant corporation.\nDefendant\u2019s petition in support of its application to strike off the judgment, while studiously avoiding an averment that it had not executed the original contract, and while making no effort to explain away the prior admissions. (in the petition to open) that it had in fact executed such document, states that \u201cthe paper attached to plaintiff\u2019s statement contains the alleged power of attorney to confess judgment, but is not signed by defendant\u201d; and, on this evasive averment, it asks that the judgment and all \u201cproceedings subsequent thereto\u201d be stricken from the record. Defendant\u2019s petition calls attention also to the following rule of the court below: \u201cEvery confession of judgment, on a warrant of attorney, shall be accompanied by the original note or bond, which shall be filed in the case.\u201d\nIn its opinion supporting the order assigned as error, the court below correctly says: \u201cSince there has been an admission of record that the agreement was signed by the defendant, [it] is estopped from denying the power of attorney......[Though by] attaching a copy [instead of the original] of the instrument containing the power of attorney [in which copy the name of defendant, at the foot thereof, was left off], a technical failure to comply with the rule of court [appears], it is such a defect as [under the circumstances of this case] might be waived by the court.\u201d Then this passage, of at least explanatory significance, occurs: \u201cAll the parties treated the original agreement as if it contained a properly signed power of attorney to confess a judgment and there is nothing, either in the testimony or upon the record, to show that the original agreement was not signed by all the parties.\u201d\nThe answer to the rule before us on this appeal avers that \u201cat the time of taking depositions, defendant offered an original of said agreement, which was signed by plaintiff and also by defendant, said offer being......admitted by the commissioner before whom the testimony was being taken\u201d; further, \u201cthat......counsel for plaintiff demanded of defendant......that said original be produced, so the same might be filed of record, but counsel for defendant failed and refused to produce said original.\u201d We find no denial of these statements in the record.\nThe order appealed from is affirmed."}
