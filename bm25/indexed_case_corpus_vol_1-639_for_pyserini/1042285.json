{"id": "1042285", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe agreement upon which the appellants base their right to an injunction was in parol, and there is no express averment in their bill that the Wyomissing Club, or any of its predecessors in title under Dunn, had notice of it. The demurrer was, therefore, properly sustained and the decree dismissing the bill is affirmed, at appellants\u2019 costs."}
