{"id": "1757595", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nJonathan Holdeen believed a system of \u201ccumulative endowments\u201d for government should replace taxation. Under Holdeen\u2019s system, governments would \u201ccreate or receive funds which shall be invested in productive investments and the income of which fund shall be wholly or partly accumulated until the amount of such funds shall be large enough so that the income thereof will pay all governmental expenses.\u201d Between 1945 and 1955, Holdeen sought to establish five \u201ccumulative endowments\u201d for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Holdeen placed comparatively modest sums in five inter vivos trusts ranging in duration from 500 to 1000 years. He directed his daughter Janet Adams and son Randal Holden, trustees, to pay a fraction of trust income to the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA) and accumulate the rest for the lives of the trusts for future charitable use by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. For example, in 1945, Holdeen established \u201cTrust 45-10.\u201d The deed of trust provides:\n\u201cone five hundredths part of the income of said estate, multiplied by the .number of years which shall have elapsed since July 5, 1944, shall be deemed \u2018expendable\u2019 income. The remainder of the said income shall be accumulated in Pennsylvania and added to the principal until the year 2444 when said principal, including accumulated income, shall be paid to the State of Pennsylvania for educational endowment or other public purposes.\u201d\nThis deed, like each of the deeds establishing Holdeen\u2019s \u201ccumulative endowments,\u201d further directs the trustees annually to pay \u201cexpendable income and all other net income hereunder which is not lawfully subject to accumulation under the terms hereof\u201d to the UUA for specified charitable uses. Holdeen, a lawyer and resident of New York, directed the trustees to administer this and his other \u201ccumulative endowments\u201d in Pennsylvania. The trustees accumulated trust income. As a result, the original sums placed in trust, together with accumulated income, by one estimate reached a value greater than twelve million dollars. The trustees petitioned the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia for a declaration on the validity of Holdeen\u2019s directions to accumulate. See Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Act of June 18, 1923, P.L. 840, \u00a7 4, 12 P.S. \u00a7 834 (1953), renumbered, 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 7535.\nThe orphans\u2019 court, Pawelec, J., relying on James Estate, 414 Pa. 80, 199 A.2d 275 (1964), entered a decree declaring invalid, as of the dates Holdeen created the trusts, Holdeen\u2019s directions to accumulate income for from 500 to 1000 years. In James, this Court adopted \u201c \u2018the law in practically all of the other states of the union\u2019 \u201d and held that provisions for the accumulation of income on behalf of charity are subject to the doctrine of \u201creasonableness.\u201d 414 Pa. at 87, 199 A.2d at 278. Under that doctrine,\n\u201c[a]n accumulation of trust income under a charitable trust created in a donative transfer is valid to the extent the accumulation is reasonable in the light of the purposes, facts and circumstances of the particular trust.\u201d\nRestatement (Second) of Property, Donative Transfers \u00a7 2.2(2) (Tent. Draft No. 2, March 15, 1979). Accord, Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 401 Comment k (1959); IV Scott on Trusts \u00a7 401.9 (3d ed. 1967) (\u201c[cjlearly ... it would be against public policy to permit accumulation for too long a period, during which period no useful disposition would be made of the property or its income\u201d). James held a settlor\u2019s direction to accumulate charitable trust income for 400 years \u201cunreasonable and void as being unnecessary, charitably purposeless and contrary to public policy as well as to testator\u2019s primary charitable intention.\u201d 414 Pa. at 89, 199 A.2d at 279. As the orphans\u2019 court held here, \u201cthe provisions . . . which require the accumulation of income for periods of 500 and 1000 years and which further provide that a substantial portion of income remain unexpended for many centuries are unreasonable under James. . [TJhese accumulations are unreasonable, contrary to public policy and void.\u201d\nThere cannot be and, indeed, is not a dispute that the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s declaration invalidating Holdeen\u2019s provisions for accumulations was correct. What is in dispute is the proper disposition of trust income unlawfully accumulated between the dates Holdeen created the trusts and entry of the orphans\u2019 court decree. The orphans\u2019 court, in accordance with Holdeen\u2019s express direction to pay \u201call other net income hereunder which is not lawfully subject to accumulation\u201d to the UUA, instructed the trustees to pay all accumulated income to the UUA. In directing disposition of unlawfully accumulated income in harmony with Holdeen\u2019s express wishes, the orphans\u2019 court observed:\n\u201c[t]he Commonwealth has no inherent right to receive any principal or income from these trusts. All of the Commonwealth\u2019s right to receive accumulated income is conditioned upon the validity of the accumulation provisions. Since these provisions have been declared invalid, and since the settlor has, in fact, expressed his intent as to alternative distribution, the claim of the Commonwealth must fail.\u201d\nOn its appeal, the Commonwealth disputes the UUA\u2019s entitlement to all unlawful accumulations. We hold the orphans\u2019 court properly directed disposition of unlawful accumulations in accordance with Holdeen\u2019s express direction.\nThe remaining controversy between the Commonwealth and . UUA does not bear upon the validity of Holdeen\u2019s long-term trusts. Nor is there any challenge to UUA\u2019s entitlement to all future trust income, including income \u201cnot lawfully subject to accumulation.\u201d Rather, the issue the Commonwealth presents is whether the orphans\u2019 court erred by ruling the accumulation provisions invalid as of the date Holdeen created the trusts. The Commonwealth\u2019s position is that the orphans\u2019 court may declare the accumulation provisions invalid \u201cprospectively\u201d only.\nWe conclude that the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s declaration invalidating the accumulation provisions as of inception of the trusts is proper. The mere fact that the adjudication of invalidity comes years after existence of circumstances justifying termination is simply the result of the failure of an interested party to bring the matter before the court. That failure, however, does not make an otherwise invalid accumulation somehow permissible. In James Estate, supra, this Court expressly held an adjudication of invalidity need await only the existence of circumstances making invalidity \u201creadily apparent.\u201d 414 Pa. at 85, 199 A.2d at 277. As Judge Pawalec fully explained here, \u201c[a]n accumulation scheme cannot \u2018become\u2019 unreasonable in duration; its duration either is or is not reasonable per se.\u201d It follows from James that just as a court can anticipate the inevitable unlawfulness of a provision for accumulation, so too the court may declare the provision invalid as of the time invalidity was \u201creadily apparent.\u201d The Commonwealth does not claim that UUA, to the Commonwealth\u2019s prejudice, caused postponement of the court\u2019s declaration of invalidity and accompanying instructions concerning unlawful accumulations. Compare e. g., Rose v. Rose, 385 Pa. 427, 123 A.2d 693 (1956) (laches argued as defense in proceedings for declaratory relief). The Commonwealth\u2019s contention that the orphans\u2019 court improperly adjudged the accumulation provisions invalid as of the time Holdeen created the trusts must be rejected.\nThe Commonwealth further suggests that, \u201cat the very least,\u201d Holdeen\u2019s schemes for the accumulation of income should be sustained until Holdeen\u2019s death in 1967. Underlying the Commonwealth\u2019s contention is the assumption that the Holdeen charitable accumulation schemes are governed by statutory limitations upon accumulation of income. See Act of April 18, 1853, P.L\u2019 503, \u00a7 9; Estates Act of 1947, Act of April 24, 1947, P.L. 100, \u00a7 6. James made clear, however, that judicial inquiry into the reasonableness of charitable accumulations is of common law dimension. See James, 414 Pa. at 90, 199 A.2d at 280 (disposition of released income guided but not governed by Estates Act of 1947). Though James scrutinized provisions for accumulation contained in a testamentary charitable trust, its common law principle of judicial intervention once invalidity is \u201creadily apparent,\u201d James, 414 Pa. at 85, 199 A.2d at 277, supports the orphans\u2019 court declaration of invalidity from inception of the trusts. Accord, Restatement (Second) of Property, Donative Transfers \u00a7\u00a7 2.2(1) & 2.2(2) (Tent. Draft No. 2, March 15, 1979) (accumulation provisions of non-charitable trusts to be measured with reference to rule against perpetuities; charitable trusts subject to standard of reasonableness \u201cin the light of the purposes, facts and circumstances of the particular trust\u201d). This claim of the Commonwealth, too, must be rejected.\nFinally, despite Holdeen\u2019s express alternative direction to pay unlawful accumulations of income to UUA, the Commonwealth reads James to require automatic payment to the charitable beneficiary on whose behalf the unlawful accumulations were directed. Nothing in James would justify disturbing Holdeen\u2019s express direction. It is true that in James this. Court fashioned the relief .of income payments on a current basis to the single beneficiary on whose behalf the settlor directed accumulation. James did so, however, solely \u2022 because this relief most closely effectuated the settlor\u2019s overall charitable plan. 414 Pa. at 90-91, 199 A.2d at 279-80. Here, Holdeen\u2019s charitable plan is clearly stated. His primary goal, of course, was to prove to governments of the world the viability of \u201ccumulative endowments.\u201d Indeed, he selected Pennsylvania, rather than his home state, as the forum for his experiment in the hope of obtaining more ready judicial sanction of his primary plan. But Holdeen realistically recognized the possibility that his experiment would not be favorably received and planned accordingly. He expressly directed payment of income \u201cnot lawfully subject to accumulation\u201d to the UUA. The Commonwealth now respects Holdeen\u2019s expressly manifested alternative charitable plan and does not claim future trust income. We are offered no persuasive reason why Holdeen\u2019s express alternative plan should not be given full effect. The orphans\u2019 court did so and our review satisfies us that determination should not be disturbed.\nAppeal quashed at No. 775 January Term, 1977. Decree affirmed at No. 804 January Term, 1977. Each party pay own costs.\n. Will of Jonathan Holdeen, Record at 44a. Holdeen died in 1967.\n. The record does not reveal the precise amount of principal placed in trust or the amount of income which accumulated over the years. We note that the decree of the orphans\u2019 court directs the trustees to file an account of each trust.' No appeal has been taken from this portion of the decree.\n. The first two digits of the \u201cnumber\u201d of the trust corresponds to the last two digits of the year in which Holdeen established the trust. The last two digits refer to the number of the \u201cfund\u201d into which the trustees have pooled the trust.\n. In 1946, 1947, 1954, and 1955, Holdeen attempted to establish four more \u201ccumulative endowments.\u201d \u201cTrust 46-10\u201d and \u201cTrust 54-120\u201d are patterned on Trust 45-10. \u201cTrust 47-10\u201d differs from Trust 45-10 only in its duration. Trust 47-10 has a stated duration not of 500, but 1000 years. \u201cTrust 55-10\u201d also resembles Trust 45-10, except Trust 55-10 is to continue for 995 years. (\u201cExpendable income\u201d of Trust 55-10 is defined as 1/1000th of annual income multiplied by the number of years elapsed since 1950.)\n. The trustees also appeal from the decree of the orphans\u2019 court. They too, however, \u201cdo not go so far as to say that the trusts should be allowed to accumulate income for their full terms as prescribed by Mr. Holdeen.\u201d Brief for Trustees at 22. Rather, they suggest the proper remedy is merely \u201cto prune his scheme, not to uproot it.\u201d Id. We agree with the UUA that the trustees are without standing to appeal. The trustees\u2019 present position defeats any possible claim that the 500 to 1000 year accumulation provisions are material to the trusts. The trustees\u2019 appeal from the decree invalidating Holdeen\u2019s accumulation schemes cannot reflect even a general desire to effectuate settlor\u2019s expressed intent. Rather, the trustees manifest an interest only in maintaining the trusts. This Court has expressly held that a mere interest in maintaining the trusts will not support an appeal by a trustee. See Musser Estate, 341 Pa. 1, 17 A.2d 411 (1941). The decree in no respect imposes charges or other obligations which may otherwise confer standing on the trustees. See 20 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 792; Karahuta Estate, 481 Pa. 512, 393 A.2d 22 (1978); Hain\u2019s Estate, 464 Pa. 349, 346 A.2d 774 (1975). The trustees\u2019 appeal must be quashed.\nWe note the trustees additionally agree with UUA in the dispute over disposition of unlawful accumulations. This does not alter our conclusion that the trustees\u2019 appeal must be quashed. \u201cA trustee has no right to take sides as between the life tenants and remainder-men.\u201d Thompson\u2019s Estate, 262 Pa. 278, 281, 105 A. 273, 274 (1918). Indeed, in Girt Estate, 452 Pa. 156, 165 n. 7, 305 A.2d 372, 378 n. 7 (1973), this Court held that a corporate fiduciary should not appeal where its position, as here, merely duplicates the position of the party in whose favor the orphans\u2019 court ruled."}
