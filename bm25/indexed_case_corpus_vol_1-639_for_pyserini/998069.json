{"id": "998069", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nUnder the power of attorney delivered in this case a judgment was entered June 5, 1902. As the learned judge of the Superior Court has clearly shown, on both reason and authority, that act was an exhaustion of the power conferred by the warrant. The confession of the second judgment on the same warrant was a nullity.\nThe decree of the Superior Court is affirmed for the reasons given by Judge Smith in his opinion filed."}
