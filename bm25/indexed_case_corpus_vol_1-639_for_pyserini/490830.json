This writ is given in such case by the Act of 18th April 1874, Pamph. L. 64, which, however, expressly provides, \u201c plaintiff may except to such decision and take a writ of error to the Supreme Court.\u201d. As the record shows no such exceptions it is clear that the court is bound to disregard the assignment of error.\nOrder affirmed, the writ of error dismissed 'at the cost of the plaintiff without prejudice."}
