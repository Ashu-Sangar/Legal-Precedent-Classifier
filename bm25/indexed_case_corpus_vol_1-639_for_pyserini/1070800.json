{"id": "1070800", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe court below refused to decree specific performance of a written agreement for the sale of real estate, and the vendee has appealed from a decree dismissing his bill. The contract in question fixed April 1, 1920, for settlement, and the chancellor found the \u201cdealings and negotiations of the parties\u201d proved they considered time of its essence; also that the \u201ccontract was altered by writing the word \u2018ten\u2019 over the word \u2018first\u2019 of April,\u201d and this change was made neither with defendant\u2019s consent nor his understanding that it postponed payment of the purchase price; that the evidence did not show the alleged postponement to have been \u201cactually agreed to by both parties\u201d; that, on the contrary, \u201cthe parties themselves treated the time limit [originally] fixed......as an essential element.\u201d On these findings, the chancellor concluded that \u201cplaintiff, having been unprepared on April 1, 1920, to consummate the contract......, and no arrangement having been agreed upon in place of it, is not entitled to a decree of specific performance.\u201d We see no error.\nThe decree is affirmed at cost of appellant."}
