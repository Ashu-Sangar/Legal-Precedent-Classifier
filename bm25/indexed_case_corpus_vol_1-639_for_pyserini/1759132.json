{"id": "1759132", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nPER CURIAM:\nAppellants seek to surcharge appellee Union National Bank of Pittsburgh, the executor of Jack S. Cooperman\u2019s estate, for selling stock owned by the estate at a price claimed to be less than adequate consideration. The Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas rejected appellants\u2019 claim as meritless and refused to impose a surcharge. We agree, and affirm the decree.\nDecedent Cooperman, with his father-in-law and brother-in-law, each owned one-third of the stock in a corporation, B&C Playlands, Inc., principally engaged in the sale of novelty items and maintenance of arcade machines. The minutes of a corporate shareholder meeting, held June 1, 1974, govern the rights of surviving owners to purchase decedent\u2019s interest in the corporation. These minutes provide:\n\u201cIn the event of the death of Jack Cooperman . his estate shall be paid lk the market value of the corporate net worth.\u201d\nDecedent died on December 8, 1975. Appellee filed its inventory of the estate on September 8, 1976. The estate\u2019s one-third interest in B&C Playlands, Inc. was valued at $2,576.33. No objection to the inventory was interposed. On September 24, 1976, appellee sold the estate\u2019s interest in the corporation to decedent\u2019s brother-in-law, a surviving owner, for this amount. Appellee filed its first accounting on March 28, 1977, and appellants\u2019 timely objection followed.\nAppellants claim that appellee improperly sold decedent\u2019s stock at the inventory value. According to appellants, this value did not reflect the \u201cmarket value\u201d of the stock. We disagree. The facts found by the orphans\u2019 court demonstrate that there is no basis for concluding that appellee\u2019s sale of B&C Playlands, Inc. stock was improper. As the orphans\u2019 court stated:\n\u201cThe evidence in this record does not establish a value of Jack\u2019s one-third which would support a surcharge of the executor in any amount. It is very difficult from this record to establish a fixed \u2018net worth\u2019 or \u2018market value\u2019 of the business at anytime pertinent to the issue involved in this case. . . . \u201d\nThe orphans\u2019 court\u2019s findings of fact are supported by adequate and competent evidence, and are therefore controlling. McCrea Estate, 475 Pa. 383, 386-87, 380 A.2d 773, 775 (1977).\nAn executor, when determining the value of an estate\u2019s assets, must exercise only \u201ccommon skill, common prudence, and common caution . . . . [H]e is not liable when he acts in good faith as others [prudent men] do with their own property . . . [.]\u201d Mereto Estate, 373 Pa. 466, 468, 96 A.2d 115, 116 (1953) (quoting cases). \u201c[T]hose who seek to surcharge a fiduciary have the burden of establishing his wrongful conduct.\u201d Estate of Ellis, III, 460 Pa. 281, 285, 333 A.2d 728, 730 (1975) (citations omitted). We agree with the orphans\u2019 court that appellee acted with the requisite skill, prudence, and caution, and that thus there is no basis on which to surcharge appellee.\nThe decree of the orphans\u2019 court is affirmed. Each party pays own costs.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\n. Appellants are the co-executors of the estate of decedent\u2019s deceased wife.\n. The orphans\u2019 court concluded:\n\u201cThe evidence shows that the business was subject to considerable volatility in its earnings and the value of its earnings and the value of its assets. For example, in 1974 there seemed to be an abundance of cash available and in that year Jack S. Cooperman received $26,000.00 as his salary from the business. In 1975 Jack received $12,500 as his salary and there was a dearth of cash. In 1975 the business was unable to pay its bills and finished the year with $14,591.00 of unpaid bills. It is intimated by counsel for the objectors that Jack S. Cooperman directed cash receipts of the business into his own pockets and that these monies do not show in the accounting records which were kept and supervised by Warren S. Bloch, the certified public accountant, who testified at the audit hearing. For the year 1975, at the end of which Jack was killed, the Objector\u2019s Exhibit B shows that the business had a net loss from operations of $23,703.00 which reduced its net worth to $6,729.00. The business owned real property in downtown Pittsburgh on Liberty Avenue, of uncertain value. In addition, the real property was heavily mortgaged in the aggregate amount of $186,-471.00. At the end of 1975 the business owed other obligations amounting to $49,522.00.\nMr. Bloch, the accountant who kept the books of B. & C. Playlands, in connection with the meaning of the term, \u2018the market value of the corporate net worth\u2019 as used in the corporate minutes, supra, testified as follows (Notes of testimony, page 162):\n\u2018Q. Excuse me, \u2018market value of the corporate net worth.\u2019 What does that mean?\nA. That is the difference between the current assets based on cost normally, the fixed assets based on cost, except perhaps real estate, if there is any, minus the obligations.\nQ. Are you saying that is the value of the assets less the liabilities?\nA. Yes.\nQ. To arrive at the net worth?\nA. Yes.\u2019\u201d"}
