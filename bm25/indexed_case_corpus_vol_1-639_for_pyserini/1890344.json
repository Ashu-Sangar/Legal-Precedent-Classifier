{"id": "1890344", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThis appeal arose from a Judgment rendered for defendants in a declaratory judgment proceeding. The pleadings and testimony raised important controverted or disputed facts and consequently a declaratory judgment proceeding will not lie. Allstate Insurance Company v. Seward, 407 Pa. 628, 182 A. 2d 715; State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company v. Semple, 407 Pa. 572, 180 A. 2d 925.\nJudgment vacated.\nMr. Justice Cohen concurs in the result."}
