{"id": "1061599", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe first, second and fourth assignments of error are not in accordance with our rules, as they fail to set forth the order of which they complain. The third is to a portion of the opinion of the court below in passing upon defendants\u2019 motion for judgment, but the order of the court on that motion is not disclosed by the assignment. As no one of the assignments disclosed anything to be reviewed, the appeal must be quashed, and it is so ordered.\nAppeal quashed."}
