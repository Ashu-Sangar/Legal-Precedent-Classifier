{"id": "574367", "contents": "Opinion by\nMu. Justice Roberts,\nIn the early morning of May 14, 1972, Herbert Riehl, while sitting in his car in Harrisburg, was shot and killed during the course of an apparent robbery attempt. Appellant, Tollie Watlington, and Thomas Epps were arrested and charged with murder. Appellant and co-defendant Epps were tried jointly before a jury and adjudged guilty of first degree murder. Both were sentenced to life imprisonment.\nOn this direct appeal, appellant challenges the trial court\u2019s failure to give a cautionary instruction regarding the testimony of co-defendant Epps. Appellant argues that the jury should have been instructed to view this testimony, coming from a \u201ccorrupt source,\u201d with extreme scrutiny. Cf. Commonwealth v. Sisak, 436 Pa. 262, 265, 259 A. 2d 428, 430 (1969).\nHowever, since no objection was made below to the trial court\u2019s charge, that issue is not now properly before this Court. Pa. E. Crim. P. 1119(b) provides: \u201cNo portions of the charge nor omissions therefrom may be assigned as error, unless specific objections are made thereto before the jury retires to deliberate.\u201d As we stated in Commonwealth v. Jennings, 442 Pa. 18, 24, 274 A. 2d 767, 770 (1971), \u201c. . . appellant\u2019s failure to take . . . specific exception to . . . the charge, as required by Pa. E. Crim. P. 1119(b), forecloses our consideration of this issue on appeal.\u201d See also Commonwealth v. Sullivan, 450 Pa. 273, 275-76, 299 A. 2d 608, 609-10 (1973).\nSince issues not raised at trial or in post-trial motions may not be raised for the first time on appeal, Commonwealth v. Agie, 449 Pa. 187, 296 A. 2d 741 (1972), appellant\u2019s claim must be decided adversely to him.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nMr. Justice Eagen concurs in the result.\nThe record indicates that at the end of the court\u2019s charge, the court inquired of defense counsel: \u201cThe Court : . . . Mr. Goldberg, on behalf of the defendant Watlington do you have any exception to put on the record at this time? Mr. Goldb!erg: No, Your Honor. The Court: Either to the Charge on the law or on the facts. Mr. Goldberg: No.\u201d"}
