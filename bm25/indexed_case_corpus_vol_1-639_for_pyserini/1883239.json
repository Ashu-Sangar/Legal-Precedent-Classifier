{"id": "1883239", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nThe plaintiffs, Thomas B. Ryan and Elizabeth H. Ryan, his wife, filed a bill in equity seeking to enjoin the defendant, Rhinehart S. Hudak, from closing and obstructing a lane or roadway leading from Valley Forge Road to their property in Worcester Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. After answer filed, a hearing ensued and the chancellor entered a decree nisi granting the prayer of the complaint. Defendant\u2019s exceptions to this ruling were subsequently dismissed by the court en banc and the injunction made permanent. The defendant appeals.\nThe material facts, none of which are in serious dispute, are as follows:\nThe plaintiffs and the defendant are owners in fee of adjoining tracts of land. The plaintiffs acquired title by deed, dated December 16, 1958. The defendant acquired title, by deed, dated August 19, 1946. Both tracts had a common owner (John Boileau) in 1828, and for some years following. The present dispute hinges upon the interpretation of an expressed reservation contained in a deed in the defendant\u2019s chain of title, which reads as follows: \u201cExcepting and reserving to the heirs of John Boileau forever the free and uninterrupted use and privilege to cleanse and repair the race or water course to the mills of the late John Boileau through the hereby granted premises as also of the road leading to said mills through the same and the privilege to the heirs and assigns of the said John Boileau forever on either side of said mill race to enter and drive wagons, carts and other carriages, to mend and repair said race or mill road, also the privilege of using the surplus water to water his meadow at all seasons and times when it can be spared from the mills of the said now or late Boileau.\u201d\nThe \u201croad\u201d referred to in the above reservation begins on plaintiffs\u2019 land on Yalley Forge Eoad, a public highway, and extends for approximately one-fifth of a mile (in part over defendant\u2019s land) to the plaintiffs\u2019 house and to another residence to the rear thereof, as well as to the mill site mentioned. The road is improved with stone and gravel, follows a winding tree-lined course, and is only sufficiently wide to permit the passage of one automobile at a time. Since the year 1920, it has been maintained by the township. Since the year 1900, the road has been openly and continuously used by the plaintiffs, their predecessors in title, their guests and trades people.\nThe only access to the plaintiffs\u2019 property from a public highway, other than by way of the road mentioned, is a township road called Shut Mill Eoad, which leads from Sldppack Pike. This road has not been maintained by the township since 1920, has virtually been in disuse since that time, is covered with grass and is frequently impassable due to mud and weather conditions.\nThe mill mentioned in the reservation was located on the tract now owned by the plaintiffs. It began operation in the late seventeen hundreds and continued in commercial operation until 1984. It was torn down in 1950, and the mill race filled at the same time. In recent months, the defendant has erected signs at the entrance to the road telling everyone to keep out and has threatened to barricade it if the plaintiffs insist upon its use.\nIt is the contention of the defendant-appellant that the reservation involved did not grant an easement for all purposes incident to the access of the plaintiffs\u2019 property, but rather intended to grant ingress and egress over the road for the limited purpose of using and maintaining the mill and the mill race; and, that this right expired with their destruction. The lower court- correctly rejected this position.\nIn Nallin-Jennings Park Co. v. Sterling, 364 Pa. 611, 73 A. 2d 390 (1950), at 615, we reaffirmed what was said in Witman v. Stichter, 299 Pa. 484, 488, 149 A. 725 namely that, \u201c \u2018 \u201cIn construing the grant or other instrument whereby the easement is created, the document itself, and that only, can, in the first instance, be looked at to discover the extent and nature of the agreement and the terms of the grant. If on the face of the document no doubt arises that the words are used in their primary sense, and if, read in that sense, they are plain and unambiguous, the matter is concluded\u201d Gale on Easements, page 80; Where the intention of the parties can be ascertained, nothing remains but to effectuate that intention: 2 Devlin on Real Estate 835; The terms of the grant, as they can be learned either by words clearly expressed, or by just and sound construction, will regulate and measure the rights of the grantee: 2 Devlin, supra, quoting Salesbury v. Andrews, 19 Pick. 250, 252.\u2019 Cf. Thompson Trust, 348 Pa. 228, 35 A. 2d 261.\u201d\nThe lower court concluded that the grant involved in itself clearly manifested an intention to give to the \u201cheirs and assigns\u201d of John Boileau the right of general access over the road. With this, we completely agree, and affirm the construction placed thereon by the lower court, wherein it stated:\n\u201cThe plain reading of the language reveals there is reserved to the heirs of John Boileau the \u2018use and privilege to cleanse and repair the race or water course to the mills\u2019 and also the \u2018use and privilege ... of the road leading to said mills . . .\u2019 These are rights reserved for the heirs of John Boileau.\n\u201cNext, there are rights reserved to the heirs and assigns of John Boileau. First, the privileges \u2018. . . forever on either side of the millrace to enter and drive the wagons, carts and other carriages, . . .\u2019 Following the word \u2018carriages\u2019 there is a comma indicating that the privileges are being separated, for there follows immediately: \u2018to mend and repair said race of mill road, also the privilege of using the surplus water to water his meadow . . .\u2019 These are three distinct privileges.\u201d\nAssuming arguendo, however, that the language of the grant is ambiguous, the same result is inescapable. The intention of the parties at the time the reservation was created is what primarily governs. If that intention is not clearly expressed, or cannot be gained from a reading of the writing itself, then the surrounding circumstances may be considered in ascertaining the true intent of the parties: Weigand v. American Stores, 346 Pa. 253, 29 A. 2d 484 (1943). Moreover, subsequent acts of the parties, tending to show the construction they themselves placed upon the writing are important in determining their intention if such is not clearly expressed therein: Peoples N. Gas Co. v. Wire Co., 155 Pa. 22, 25 A. 749 (1893); Cirotti v. Wassell, 163 Pa. Superior Ct. 292, 60 A. 2d 339 (1948); and, Birdsall-Friedman Co. v. Globe and Rutgers Ins. Co., 326 Pa. 404, 190 A. 924 (1937).\nIn the case at bar, the court factually found and the undisputed evidence abundantly supports the conclusion that continuously from at least 1900 (the reservation in question is contained in a deed given in the year 1904), the road has been used for general access purposes by the occupants of plaintiffs\u2019 property, their guests and trades people. Also, that despite knowledge of this use by the defendant\u2019s predecessor in title, whose title dates back to the year 1904, no objection was voiced until the defendant saw fit to do so in very recent years. These facts indicate to us, that at the time of the 1904 deed, the parties to the instrument were well aware that the road was being used for purposes not related to the mill. If it were intended to limit travel over the land for the mill purposes only, as appellant now contends, certainly it might reasonably be expected that an immediate objection to any unauthorized use would be forthcoming, shortly after the conveyance was effectuated. See, Restatement, Property, \u00a7483 (d) (1944).\nDecree affirmed, costs to be paid by the appellant."}
