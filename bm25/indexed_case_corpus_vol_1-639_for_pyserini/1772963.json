{"id": "1772963", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAt issue in each of the two cases now before the Court is whether chiropractic expenses are \u201cmedical services\u201d for purposes of the $750 threshold of the Pennsylvania No-Fault Motor Vehicle Insurance Act, Act of July 19, 1974, P.L. 489, \u00a7 301(a)(5)(B), 40 P.S. \u00a7 1009.301(a)(5)(B) (Supp.1980). We conclude that \u201cmedical services\u201d include chiropractic services and hence reverse the orders of the Superior Court.\nAppellant Margaret Miller and appellant Doris Strunack each filed a complaint in trespass alleging negligence on the part of the named defendants for injuries sustained in automobile accidents. Both appellants claimed that these injuries had caused them to incur medical expenses in excess of the threshold amount of $750.00 required for the \u201cmaintenance of a cause of action for personal injuries\u201d under the No-Fault Act. Answers to interrogatories revealed that a large portion of the fees claimed for medical expenses consisted of payments for chiropractic services, and that if the amounts paid for chiropractic services were deducted from the totals, the remaining amounts would be less than $750.00.\nProceeding on the theory that expenses' for chiropractic services were not properly includable as \u201cmedical expenses,\u201d appellees sought judgment in their favor. In the case of appellant Miller, appellees filed a motion for summary judgment. The Court of Common Pleas of Lehigh County granted the motion and a panel of the Superior Court affirmed per curiam. In the case of appellant Strunack, appellees filed a motion to strike the complaint and dismiss the action. Although the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County initially denied the motion, the court granted the motion upon reargument, on the basis of an intervening per curiam decision by the Superior Court in Babcock v. Tippett, 260 Pa.Super. 583, 394 A.2d 607 (1978). Subsequently, a majority of the Superior Court (Spaeth, J., joined by Cercone, P. J., and Brosky, J., dissenting) affirmed the trial court\u2019s order. 283 Pa.Super. 585, 424 A.2d 1355 (1981).\nWe granted allowance of appeal in both cases and, because they present the same issue of law, we consolidated them for argument and decision.\nThe relevant section of the No-Fault Act, \u00a7 301(a)(5)(B), provides:\n\u201cTort liability is abolished with respect to any injury that takes place in this State in accordance with the provisions of this act if such injury arises out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle, except that:\n[A] person remains liable for damages for noneconomic detriment [(\u2018pain, suffering, inconvenience, physical impairment, and other nonpecuniary damage recoverable under the tort law applicable to injury arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle\u2019: \u00a7 103)] if the accident results in:\n* *****\nThe reasonable value of reasonable and necessary medical and dental services, including prosthetic devices and necessary ambulance, hospital and professional nursing expenses incurred in the diagnosis, care and recovery of the victim, exclusive of diagnostic x-ray costs and rehabilitation costs in excess of one hundred dollars ($100) is [sic] in excess of seven hundred fifty dollars ($750).\nsfc * * * % *\nThere is no explicit definition of \u201cmedical and dental services\u201d contained in the No-Fault Act. Although section 301(a)(5)(B) states that such services include \u201cprosthetic devices and necessary ambulance, hospital and professional nursing expenses incurred in the diagnosis, care and recovery of the victim, ...\u201d this language must not be read to limit the scope of \u201cmedical and dental services.\u201d Rather, this language reflects a legislative intent to assure that \u201cmedical and dental services\u201d includes not only direct but also supplemental support services.\nIt is necessary, therefore, to consult applicable statutory definitions. The dissenting opinion of Judge Spaeth, filed in the case of appellant Strunack, observed:\n\u201cThe Statutory Construction Act defines \u2018Medicine and surgery\u2019 as:\nThe art and science having for their object the cure of diseases of and the preservation of the health of man, including all practice of the healing art with or without drugs, except healing by spiritual means of prayer. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1991 (Purdon\u2019s Supp. 1964-1978).\nAnd \u2018Healing art\u2019 as:\nThe science of diagnosis and treatment in any manner whatsoever of disease or any ailment of the human body. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1991 (Purdon\u2019s Supp. 1964-1978) (emphasis added).\nWe may fairly assume that the legislature was aware of these definitions when drafting the No-Fault Motor Vehicle Act. Moreover, the legislature has previously considered chiropractic services as a form of the healing arts. In the Chiropractic Registration Act of 1951, 63 P.S. \u00a7 601 (Purdon\u2019s 1968), the legislature defined Chiropractic as a\n\u2018limited science of the healing arts dealing with the relationship between the articulations of the vertebral column, as well as other articulations, and the nervous system and the role of these relationships in the restoration and maintenance of health.\u2019 63 P.S. \u00a7 602(b) (Purdon\u2019s 1968).\nIn the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 531 (Purdon\u2019s Supp. 1979-80), the legislature provided for payment by the employer of \u2018reasonable surgical and medical services, services provided by duly licensed practitioners of the healing arts, medicines, and supplies.\u2019 This provision has been interpreted as requiring employers to pay for chiropractic services. Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. v. Overmyer Mold, 473 Pa. 369, 374 A.2d 689 (1977).\u201d\n283 Pa.Super. at 589-90, 424 A.2d at 1357-58 (footnote omitted).\nThere can be no serious question that chiropractic expenses can be recovered under the \u201callowable expenses\u201d component of \u201cbasic loss benefits\u201d under the No-Fault Act. Section 103 provides that \u201callowable expenses\u201d include \u201cmedical and vocational rehabilitation services,\u201d defined as \u201cservices necessary to reduce disability and to restore the physical, psychological, social, and vocational functioning of a victim.\u201d Section 103 further provides that these services \u201cmay include, but are not limited to ...\u201d the following:\n\u201cmedical care, diagnostic and evaluation procedures, physical and occupational therapy, other necessary therapies, speech pathology and audiology, optometric services, nursing care under the supervision of a registered nurse, medical social services, vocational rehabilitation and training services, occupational licenses and tools, and transportation where necessary to secure medical and vocational rehabilitation services.\u201d\nWe are unwilling to conclude that the Legislature could have intended chiropractic expenses to be included, on the one hand, under basic loss benefits coverage, but excluded, on the other, for purposes of determining whether a tort action to recover \u201cnoneconomic detriment\u201d can be maintained. Accordingly, we hold that chiropractic expenses may be counted as \u201cmedical services\u201d for purposes of meeting the No-Fault Act\u2019s $750 threshold.\nOrders reversed and records remanded to the courts of common pleas for proceedings consistent with this opinion."}
