{"id": "1286221", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief-Justice Jones,\nIn this trespass action for damages for personal injuries, tbe jury returned a verdict for tbe defendant. Tbe court awarded the plaintiff a new trial on tbe ground that tbe trial judge bad committed harmful error in allowing tbe defendant, over plaintiffs objection, to cross-examine a witness for tbe plaintiff excessively and in admitting (also over plaintiffs objection) rebuttal testimony for tbe purpose of contradicting tbe witness in respect of bis testimony improperly elicited in cross-examination. At tbe defendant\u2019s instance, tbe trial court certified that the order granting a new trial was founded entirely, to tbe exclusion of any other reason, on tbe trial judge\u2019s allowance of tbe assailed cross-examination and rebuttal testimony. Tbe record does not show that tbe certificate was obtained with prior notice to tbe plaintiff. If not, it should have been. Tbe defendant has appealed tbe new trial order, contending that it should be reversed and that judgment should be entered on tbe jury\u2019s verdict for tbe defendant.\nTbe plaintiff received tbe injuries, for which be brought suit, in a collision between bis automobile, which he was driving, and a streetcar of tbe defendant company, operated by its employee, in tbe Borough of Castle Shannon, Allegheny County.\nAt trial, tbe plaintiff called as a witness tbe Chief of Police of tbe Borough, Andrew Orr, who, in tbe course of bis investigation of tbe accident, bad interviewed tbe motorman of tbe streetcar (two other persons being present during tbe interview). In direct examination, plaintiff\u2019s counsel questioned Orr and tbe latter answered, as follows : \u201cQ. Did you interrogate tbe operator of tbe street ear later? A. Yes, I did, sir. Q. What was bis name? A. Charles Walter Schmidt. Q. Hid you. ask Mm what speed he was making through the intersection there? A. Yes, sir. Q. What answer did he give you? A. Fifteen miles per hour.\u201d That was the extent of the plaintiff\u2019s direct examination of the witness Orr with respect to Ms conversation with motorman Schmidt subsequent to the accident.\nOn cross-examination, defendant\u2019s counsel asked Orr nothing concerning the speed of the streetcar at the time of the accident, as related by Schmidt at his interview by Orr, but was permitted, over plaintiff\u2019s objection, to interrogate Orr relative to statements supposedly made by him, during his interview of Schmidt, concerning admissions of causative fault on his part allegedly made by the plaintiff to On* when the latter interviewed the plaintiff at a hospital following the accident. The culmination of defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Orr in this connection reads as follows: \u201cQ. Ho you remember relaying to them [i.e., Schmidt and the two other persons present] what Mr. Okotkewicz told you as to how it [the accident] happened? A. No. Q. You didn\u2019t? A. No. Q. Now, you didn\u2019t tell them that Lefty [the plaintiff] told you that he couldn\u2019t see the car because he came from behind an opposite bound car? A. No.\u201d The impropriety of this non-germane and otherwise objectionable cross-examination was further aggravated by testimony offered by the defendant in rebuttal.\nThe defendant called as a witness, Andrew B. Adamson, a general police agent of the defendant company, who was one of the persons present at the conversation between Chief Orr and motorman Schmidt. Adamson was permitted to testify, over the plaintiff\u2019s objection, for the ostensible purpose of impeaching Orr\u2019s answers during cross-examination by the defendant concerning his conversation with Schmidt, as follows : \u201cQ. Hid the Chief relay to you [during his conversation with Schmidt] \u2014 now, just answer this yes or no \u2014 certain information that he had secured from Mr. Okotkewicz as to what had happened? A. Yes, sir. Q. What is that? A. Yes, sir.\u201d\nA single conversation may, of course, cover a number of different matters. Consequently, inquiry in direct examination strictly limited to one specific independent part does not open the door to cross-examination on all unrelated matters embraced by the conversation. Here, the single thing inquired about on direct examination with respect to Orr\u2019s interview of Schmidt was limited to what Schmidt had said the speed of the streetcar was at the time of the accident. In cross-examination defendant\u2019s counsel made no inquiry relative to Schmidt\u2019s statement about speed but went directly to what Orr, not Schmidt, was supposed to have said about an entirely different matter during his conversation with Schmidt. In this State, except where a party is the witness, cross-examination is limited to subject matters covered in direct examination. The defendant may not properly introduce his defense by way of cross-examination: Tolomeo v. Harmony Short Line Motor Transportation Co., 349 Pa. 420, 37 A. 2d 511. The defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Orr, in the particular mentioned, obviously exceeded the bounds of proper cross-examination and should have been excluded upon the plaintiff\u2019s timely objection.\nThe cross-examination offended even more grievously. Either the cross-examiner knew or didn\u2019t know what Orr would answer to the inquiry as to whether Orr had not stated during his interview of Schmidt that the plaintiff had told him that \u201c. . . he couldn\u2019t see the [street] car because he came from behind an opposite bound car.\u201d If Orr\u2019s response was to be an affirmation, it would have been matter of defense, and he should have been called by the defendant in its case to testify to what would have been an admission by the plaintiff against interest. On the other hand, if Orr answered in the negative, as he actually did, the imputation of the cross-examination that he had so stated during his conversation with Schmidt, even though denied, had the capacity of putting into the minds of the jurors a suggestion that should not have been introduced.\nTo make matters worse, the defendant called in rebuttal Adamson, its general police agent, and asked him whether Chief Orr had related, in Adamson\u2019s presence, during Qrr\u2019s conversation with Schmidt, \u201ccertain information that he [Orr] had secured from Mr. Okotkewicz as to what had happened.\u201d Adamson\u2019s answer was, \u201cYes, sir.\u201d This could not help but have served to confirm in the minds of the jury that the plaintiff had in fact admitted his fatilt with respect to the accident and that Orr was untruthful in his denial of what he was reputed to have said. If that was not the purpose of Adamson\u2019s testimony, then he would not qualify as a rebuttal witness for the purpose of impeaching Orr with respect to his denial of what he was alleged to have said in his interview of Schmidt. The improper cross-examination and rebuttal, thus circuitously injected into the evidence, undoubtedly had the effect of substantive testimony when, at best, it could have been no more than an impeachment of Orr\u2019s credibility, assuming the interrogation of Adamson had been properly phrased, as it was not, in the precise terms of the question asked Orr, which he had answered in the negative.\nIt requires no imagination to realize the harm that was done the plaintiff by the prejudicial errors at trial in respect of the evidentiary matters which we have discussed. The trial judge, fully realizing the harm that had been done the plaintiff, clearly and cogently said, in the opinion for the court granting a new trial,\u2014 \u201cWe are of the opinion that by allowing this testimony the defendant was permitted to improperly convey to the jury the inference that the plaintiff was to blame for the accident. We also feel that this error was prejudicial. . . . The jury apparently received the wrong impression from this improper cross-examination. It is also possible that the jury got the impression that the plaintiff\u2019s attorney was trying to prevent the defendant\u2019s agent from telling the true story. We believe, therefore, that justice demands that a new trial be granted.\u201d With that, we thoroughly agree.\nThe appellant further argues that, even if the complained of cross-examination of Orr and the admission of Adamson\u2019s so-called rebuttal testimony were erroneous, the errors were cured when the plaintiff\u2019s counsel was later permitted to impart to the jury, erroneously as the defendant claims, his impression of what absent witnesses would have testified concerning the operation of the streetcar, had they been present in court. The contention is devoid of merit. This record does not present a situation where an erroneous ruling against one party to the action is offset by a subsequent mistaken ruling against the other. The harm done the plaintiff by the improper cross-examination of Orr so permeated the trial as to render innocuous the asserted error later committed against the defendant.\nOrder affirmed."}
