{"id": "1782430", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThis is a direct appeal from an Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County. On August 15, 1980 the lower court found Appellant guilty of direct criminal contempt and fined him $250.00. The following facts are pertinent to the disposition of this matter.\nSometime on August 13,1980 Appellant received an Order of Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon County to appear at 3:00 p.m. the next day, August 14, in connection with a hearing in a murder case in which Appellant was defense counsel. At the time, Appellant was trying a case before the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County. At approximately 1:45 p.m. on the afternoon of August 14, Appellant had just completed the Berks County trial and was awaiting the return of the jury. Appellant arranged for an associate to be present for the verdict or questions from the jury and informed the Assistant Court Administrator of his necessary departure and was himself informed that while he had cases remaining on the stand-by trial list for that day, none had been assigned to trial at that time. In fact, a view of the list posted on a blackboard outside the courtroom showed that nine cases were listed before those of Appellant on the stand-by list, and there remained 51 other cases on the ready list.\nThe Assistant Court Administrator did not advise the president judge of Appellant\u2019s forced absence until later in the afternoon when new cases were about to be assigned (C.H. 21-22). At that time, Appellant\u2019s cases were called and then bypassed for other cases on the list.\nUpon Appellant\u2019s return to the Berks County Courthouse on August 15, 1980, he was summoned to the courtroom of the President Judge and cited for contempt of court. A hearing was held, and Appellant was found guilty of the charge.\nOur legislature has defined the circumstances under which the courts may utilize the summary contempt power. 42 P.C.S.A. \u00a7 4131 provides:\n\u201cThe power of the several courts of this Commonwealth to issue attachments and to inflict summary punishments for contempts of court shall be restricted to the following cases:\n(1) The official misconduct of the officers of such courts respectively.\n(2) Disobedience or neglect by officers, parties, jurors or witnesses of or to the lawful process of the court.\n(3) The misbehavior of any person in the presence of the court, thereby obstructing the administration of justice.\u201d\nIn reviewing convictions under this section, we have consistently held that every element of the offense must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Matter of Ring, 492 Pa. 407, 424 A.2d 1255 (1981); Matter of Campolongo, 495 Pa. 627, 435 A.2d 581 (1981); Matter of Mandell, 489 Pa. 522, 414 A.2d 1013 (1980).\nWe have also been consistent in our holding that absent a finding of intentional and willful commissions of the contemptuous act, a conviction under \u00a7 4131 will not lie. Ring, Supra; Mandell, Supra. Accord, Comm. v. Giordano, 254 Pa.Super. 543, 386 A.2d 83 (1978).\nThe record in the instant matter is clearly devoid of any evidence of intent on the part of Appellant to disobey the Order of the Berks County Court to be available for courtroom assignment on August 14. Rather, it appears that Appellant did all that was within his power to minimize the disruption caused by his receipt of the Lebanon County Order.\nTo accept the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that Appellant\u2019s acts were intentional because he failed to notify the president judge personally of his conflict is to view life in a vacuum. Instead, we choose to view the circumstances in their entirety and thusly evaluate the reasonableness of the Appellant\u2019s actions.\nOftentimes a lawyer finds himself in a situation whereby he must arrange his affairs to minimize the effects of an unforeseen conflict. Where time is short, it is not always possible or practical to notify the president judge personally of a conflict. In this instance, notifying an officer of the court with knowledge of the circumstances is a reasonable alternative.\nAppellant did notify the Assistant Court Administrator prior to his departure. Having done this, he was informed that none of his pending cases had been assigned at that time, and he was also aware that nine cases preceded his on the stand-by list. In addition, he had arranged for his associate to await the outcome of the trial just completed. This, factually, is what occurred.\nThis Court is acutely cognizant of the need for prompt judicial administration and of the lower courts\u2019 constant and laudable efforts to satisfy that need. Indeed, we have carefully considered this aspect in the disposition of this matter and would be remiss if we were to leave the impression, by our decision today, that this Court will condone arbitrary acts by members of the bar which disrupt the orderly functioning of the court.\nHowever, having viewed the totality of the circumstances and finding no evidence of intentional or willful misconduct, we must reverse the findings of the lower court.\nAccordingly, the Order of the lower court is hereby reversed.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion in McDERMOTT, J., joined.\nFLAHERTY, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which McDERMOTT, J., joined.\n. Jurisdiction over the instant appeal is pursuant to Act of July 9, 1976 P.L. 586, No. 142 \u00a7 2, effective June 27, 1978; the said conduct upon which the appeal is based having occurred prior to the 1980 amendment, Act of September 23, P.L. 686, No. 137, effective in sixty (60) days."}
