{"id": "1083592", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nIn these two cases, the court below refused to enter judgments for want of sufficient affidavits of defense, and there followed the instant appeals, which were presented to us as one.\nWe are not convinced the court below erred in its conclusion that a proper judicial determination of the controversies between the parties would be facilitated by an opportunity for a broader inquiry into the facts than is presented by the bare pleadings; therefore it did not err in discharging plaintiff\u2019s rules: Griffith v. Sitgreaves, 81* Pa. 378; Marquis v. McKay, 216 Pa. 307; Beck v. Schekter, 235 Pa. 253; County Savings Bank v. Gillette, 273 Pa. 262.\nThe orders appealed from are affirmed."}
