{"id": "1941743", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Roberts,\nThe Commonwealth in this appeal calls upon this Court to hold the federal constitutional standards of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (1966), inapplicable to a 1963 confession sought to be introduced in a post-Miranda trial. This contention must be rejected. It ignores the controlling and unambiguous pronouncements of the United States Supreme Court concerning the extent of Miranda\u2019s retroactivity. These pronouncements have been scrupulously followed not only by an unbroken line of decisions of this Court but also by virtually every other court in the nation which has dealt with the issue.\nThe procedural history of the present appeal is as follows: On October 3, 1963, appellant Paul Ware confessed to the commission of four murders. The statements were elicited from him in the course of custodial interrogation and were not preceded by the warnings of constitutional rights mandated by Miranda. A murder indictment was returned against appellant in December of 1963, but further prosecution was postponed as a result of his commitment to Farview State Hospital pursuant to a court order declaring him to be mentally incompetent to stand trial.\nIn July of 1967, appellant was found to have regained his competency, and his case was listed for trial. However, on May 23, 1968, the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas ordered the 1963 confessions suppressed for the reason that they had been obtained in circumstances violative of Mvranda. In light of the suppression order and the absence of other independent evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt, the Commonwealth petitioned for the entry of a nolle prosequi. Appellant offered no objection, and the court approved the nolle prosequi.\nOn August 11, 1969, more than one year after the original suppression order and nine months after the entry of the nolle prosequi, the Commonwealth changed its position and moved for removal of the nolle prosequi. The motion was granted over appellant\u2019s objection, and the Commonwealth then petitioned the court to vacate its prior suppression order and allow a rehearing of the matter. This request was likewise granted over objection, and a suppression hearing was held on June 25 and June 26,1970. On November 13, 1970, the court of common pleas held that the confessions were admissible in evidence notwithstanding the conceded absence of Miranda warnings. This appeal followed.\nThe Commonwealth argues in defense of the trial court\u2019s suppression order that the standards of Miranda should not apply to a confession obtained prior to the date of that decision. We need not, however, respond to the Commonwealth\u2019s view as to what \u201cshould be\u201d: to put it quite simply, the matter is no longer an open question.\nIn Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S. Ct. 1772 (1966), the United States Supreme Court was squarely confronted with the question whether and to what extent Miranda should be accorded retroactive application. After carefully analyzing the material considerations, the Court concluded: \u201cWe hold further that Miranda applies only to cases in which the trial began after the date of our decision one week ago.\u201d Id. at 721, 86 S. Ct. at 1775.\nWe cannot imagine how the Supreme Court could possibly have spoken more definitely. That Court made it clear that the date of trial is the operative event, and that therefore the Miranda standards must be applied to all post-Miranda trials, including those cases such as the present one involving pre-Miranda confessions. This Court has not only faithfully honored the United States Supreme Court\u2019s clear directive, see Commonwealth v. Davis, 440 Pa. 123, 270 A. 2d 199 (1970); Commonwealth v. Singleton, 439 Pa. 185, 266 A. 2d 753 (1970); Commonwealth v. Bennett, 439 Pa. 34, 264 A. 2d 706 (1970); Commonwealth v. Ware, 438 Pa. 517, 265 A. 2d 790 (1970); Commonwealth v. Yount, 435 Pa. 276, 256 A. 2d 464 (1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 925, 90 S. Ct. 918 (1970); Commonwealth v. Williams, 432 Pa. 557, 248 A. 2d 301 (1968); Commonwealth v. Bordner, 432 Pa. 405, 247 A. 2d 612 (1968); Commonwealth v. Leaming, 432 Pa. 326, 247 A. 2d 590 (1968); Commonwealth v. Robinson, 428 Pa. 458, 239 A. 2d 308 (1968); Commonwealth v. Sites, 427 Pa. 486, 235 A. 2d 387 (1967), but we adopt tbe Johnson position as a matter of state law.\nTbe Commonwealth would have us abandon the foregoing state and federal case law on the ground that the trial date language in Johnson was merely \u201cill-considered\u201d and \u201cinadvertent\u201d dicta. We are unpersuaded.\nIn the first place, a state court is not free to ignore the dictates of the United States Supreme Court on federal constitutional matters because of its own conclusion that those dictates are \u201cill-considered\u201d. Even if this or any other court should disagree with the views of the United States Supreme Court on a particular constitutional issue, those views are binding. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Williams, 432 Pa. 557, 568 n. *, 248 A. 2d 301, 307 n. 8 (1968).\nIn the second place, we do not believe that the Supreme Court was speaking \u201cinadvertently\u201d when it stated five separate times in Johnson that Miranda should apply to all post-Miranda trials. Any possible doubts in this regard should have been forever put to rest by the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in Jenkins v. Delaware, 395 U.S. 213, 89 S. Ct. 1677 (1969), which further clarified and explicitly reaffirmed the principles of Johnson: \u201c[W]e could have . . . made the point of initial reliance, the moment the defendant is interrogated, the operative event. But in an effort to extend the protection of Miranda to as many defendants as ivas consistent with society\u2019s legitimate concern that convictions already validly obtained not be needlessly aborted, we selected the commencement of the trial.\u201d Id. at 219, 89 S. Ct. at 1680-81.\nFinally, we must reject the Commonwealth\u2019s claim that Johnson has been overruled sub silentio by the Supreme Court\u2019s more recent retroactivity cases fixing the date of the alleged constitutional violation rather than the date of trial as the operative cut-off date. There are, of course, \u201coccasional situations in which subsequent Supreme Court opinions have so eroded an older case, without explicitly overruling it, as to warrant a subordinate court in pursuing what it conceives to be a clearly defined new lead from the Supreme Court to a conclusion inconsistent with an older Supreme Court case.\u201d Rowe v. Peyton, 383 F. 2d 709, 714 (4th Cir. 1967). But this is certainly not such a situation. Johnson\u2019s trial date rule has been reaffirmed by the Supreme Court as recently as April 5, 1971. See Mackey v. United States, 401 U.S. 667, 714, 91 S. Ct. 1160, 1164 (1971); Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 665 n. 7, 91 S. Ct. 1148, 1153 n. 7 (1971). Therefore, we are without constitutional authority to adopt a test for the retroactivity of Miranda which is inconsistent with Johnson. Additionally, we are in agreement with the rationale of Johnson, and we affirm it as a matter of state law. Cf. Commonwealth v. Blackman, 446 Pa. 61, 285 A. 2d 521 (1971).\nThe order of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas is reversed.\nMr. Justice Jones concurs in the result.\nMr. Justice O\u2019Brien joined in the opinion of the Court and filed a concurring opinion.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell and Mr. Justice Pomeroy took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nSee eases cited pages 55-56, infra.\nSee cases cited footnote 5, infra.\nThis iuterlocutory appeal was allowed pursuant to Section 001(b) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of July 31, 1970, 1?. L. 678, Art. V, 17 P.S. \u00a7211.501(b). Section 501(b) provides in pertinent part as follows: \u201cWhen a court or administrative agency, in making an interlocutory order in a matter in which its final order would be within the jurisdiction of an appellate court, shall be of the opinion that such order involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter, it shall so state in such order. The appellate court may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be- taken from such order.\u201d The certification required by'Section 501(b) was made by the court of common pleas on December 1, 1970, upon the joint petition of appellant and the Commonwealth.\n\u201cWe must look to the purpose of our new standards governing police interrogation, the reliance which may have been placed upon prior decisions on the subject, and the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of Escobedo and Miranda.\u201d 384 U.S. at 727, 86 S. Ct. at 1777.\nNor, we might add, has our interpretation of Johnson been unique. See Posey v. United States, 416 F. 2d 545, 549 (5th Cir. 1969) ; Sheer v. United States, 414 F. 2d 122 (5th Cir. 1969) ; Camacho v. United States, 407 F. 2d 39 (9th Cir. 1969) ; United States v. Fox, 403 F. 2d 97 (2d Cir. 1968) ; United States v. Vanterpool, 394 F. 2d 697 (2d Cir. 1968) ; Groshart v. United States, 392 F. 2d 172 (9th Cir. 1968) ; Evans v. United States, 375 F. 2d 355 (8th Cir. 1967) ; Rolland v. Michigan, 320 F.

Lewis, 274 N.C. 438, 164 S.E. 2d 177 (1968) (semble) ; Clark v. Smith, 224 Ga. 766, 164 S.E. 2d 790 (1968).\n\u201cWe hold further that Miranda applies only to cases in which the trial began after the date of our decision one week ago.\u201d\n\u201cAll of the reasons set forth above for making Escobedo and Miranda nonretroactive suggest that these decisions should apply only to trials begun after the decisions were announced.\u201d\n\u201cProspective application only to trials begun after the standards were announced is particularly appropriate here.\u201d\n\u201cIn the light of these additional considerations, we conclude that Escobedo and Miranda should apply only to oases commenced after those decisions were announced.\u201d\n\u201c. . . and these guidelines [of Miranda] are therefore available only to persons whose trials had not begun as of June 13, 1966.\u201d 384 U.S. at 721, 732, 733, 734, 86 S. Ct. at 1775, 1780, 1781 (emphasis added).\nSee, e.g., Williams v. United States, 401 U.S. 646, 91 S. Ct. 1148 (1971), holding Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S. Ct. 2034 (1969), applicable to searches conducted after the date of Chimel; Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S. Ct. 1967 (1967), holding United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218, 87 S. Ct. 1926 (1967), applicable only to cases where the lineup occurred after the decision in Wads."}
