{"id": "1839703", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nAppellant Richard Haefner appeals from the order of the Superior Court affirming the grant by the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County of preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer 415 Pa.Super. 662, 601 A.2d 376 (1991). This appeal stems from a malicious prosecution action commenced by appellant in which he contends that appellees James Burkey, Kevin Burkey and Randy Klivansky, who were minors at the time, conspired with appellees Jerry P. Crump and Edward H. Snyder, local law enforcement officials, to charge appellant falsely with morals offenses. Appellant also contends that the appellees harassed him, interfered with his defense, intimidated witnesses and jurors, bribed witnesses and jurors, and committed perjury.\nAppellant was arrested and charged with corruption of minors and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse based on allegations made by appellees Kevin Burkey and Randy Klivansky. Appellant\u2019s first trial, which involved the alleged criminal conduct against appellee Kevin Burkey, resulted in a mistrial declared prematurely by the trial judge following the jury\u2019s announcement that it could not reach a unanimous verdict after several hours of deliberation. Although the Commonwealth attempted to try appellant again, the Superior Court quashed, the indictment because a retrial would have violated appellant\u2019s double jeopardy rights. Commonwealth v. Haefner, 264 Pa.Super. 144, 399 A.2d 707 (1979). Subsequently, the Commonwealth nolle prossed the remaining charges against appellant, which involved the alleged criminal conduct against appellee Randy Klivansky, based on insufficient evidence.\nAppellant then commenced the first of two federal civil rights actions alleging unlawful arrest, physical and mental abuse during police custody and prosecution of criminal charges against him without probable cause. Appellant also included pendent state claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress and malicious prosecution. The federal court dismissed the complaint and held that the federal claims were either time barred or failed to state a claim upon which federal relief could be granted. Haefner v. County of Lancaster, 520 F.Supp. 131 (E.D.Pa.1981), aff'd, 681 F.2d 806 (3d Cir.1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 874, 103 S.Ct. 165, 74 L.Ed.2d 136 (1982) (Haefner I).\nSubsequently, appellant brought a second federal action based on essentially the same facts. The court dismissed the federal civil rights claims because Haefner I acted as res judicata to bar reconsideration. The court then granted appellant\u2019s request to transfer the pendent state claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress and malicious prosecution to the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County. Haefner v. Lancaster County, 543 F.Supp. 264 (E.D.Pa.1982), aff'd, 707 F.2d 1401 (3d Cir.1983) (Haefner II).\nIn the Court of Common Pleas, appellees filed inter alia preliminary objections in the nature of a demurrer. The trial court granted the preliminary objections because it found that the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was barred by the statute of limitations and because Haefner I and Haefner II acted as res judicata to bar consideration of the malicious prosecution claim. As a result, the trial court dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint.\nOn appeal, the Superior Court concluded that the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was indeed time barred. The court also concluded that the federal court did not exercise jurisdiction over appellant\u2019s malicious prosecution claim, and therefore, the trial court erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s malicious prosecution claim because of res judicata.\nThe Superior Court, however, affirmed the dismissal of appellant\u2019s malicious prosecution claim because it held, sua sponte, that appellant failed to establish a right to recovery as a matter of law. The court based its decision on the fact that neither of the initial criminal actions against appellant terminated in a manner consistent with his innocence. This appeal followed.\nIn order to subject a person to liability for malicious prosecution, the criminal proceedings must have terminated in favor of the accused. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 658 (1977). Appellant argues that the declaration of a mistrial in the first criminal proceeding against him and the subsequent quashing of the indictment by the Superior Court represents a termination in favor of appellant. We agree.\nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts specifically delineates what constitutes termination in favor of the accused:\n\u00a7 659. Manner of Termination\nCriminal proceedings are terminated in favor of the accused by\n(a) a discharge by a magistrate at a preliminary hearing, or\n(b) the refusal of a grand jury to indict, or\n(c) the formal abandonment of the proceedings by the public prosecutor, or\n(d) the quashing of an indictment or information, or\n(e) an acquittal, or\n(f) a final order in favor of the accused by a trial dr appellate court.\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 659 (emphasis added).\nIn the case herein, appellant\u2019s criminal trial ended in the declaration of a mistrial. When the Commonwealth later attempted to retry appellant, he filed a pretrial motion to quash the indictment. The trial court denied the motion, and appellant appealed to the Superior Court, which granted appellant\u2019s motion to quash because a second trial would be violative of his right not to be placed in double jeopardy. See Commonwealth v. Haefner, 264 Pa.Super. 144, 399 A.2d 707 (1979). Because appellant\u2019s indictment was quashed, the criminal action terminated in favor of appellant pursuant to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 659(d). Therefore, the Superi- or Court erred in finding that appellant did not establish any right to recovery as a matter of law as to the first criminal action against appellant.\nWe likewise find that the Superior Court erred in finding that the second criminal action against appellant, which ended in the entry of a nolle pros by the Commonwealth, did not terminate in favor of appellant. The prosecution formally abandoned the criminal proceedings against appellant when it nolle prossed the remaining charges because of insufficient evidence. As such, the proceedings terminated in favor of the appellant pursuant to Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 659(c). \u201c[I]f the defendant is discharged after abandonment of the charges by the prosecutor, or the charges are withdrawn by the prosecutor, this is sufficient to satisfy the requisite element of prior favorable termination of the criminal action.\u201d Woodyatt v. Bank of Old York Road, 408 Pa. 257, 259, 182 A.2d 500, 501 (1962).\nAccordingly, we reverse the decision of the Superior Court and remand to the Court of Common Pleas for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nMONTEMURO, J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nCAPPY, J., files a concurring opinion.\n. On appeal to this Court, appellant does not challenge the Superior Court's determination that his intentional infliction of emotional distress claim was time barred.\n. We note that the charges were never reinstated, and the statute of limitations has since expired."}
