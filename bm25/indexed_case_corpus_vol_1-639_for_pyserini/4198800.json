{"id": "4198800", "contents": "OPINION\nChief Justice CASTILLE.\nPetitioners, the City of Philadelphia\u2019s Board of Revision of Taxes (\u201cthe BRT\u201d) and Charlesretta Meade, Robert N.C. Nix, III, Russell M. Nigro, Alan K. Silberstein, Howard M. Goldsmith, and Anthony Lewis, Jr., individually and in their official capacities as BRT members, filed in this Court an application for leave to file original process, which we grant, and an application for the \u201cExercise of Original Jurisdiction and King\u2019s Bench Power\u201d over this lawsuit against respondent, the City of Philadelphia (\u201cCity\u201d). Petitioners ask that we exercise jurisdiction and then grant: (1) preliminary and permanent injunctions, and/or writs of mandamus, prohibition, and quo warranto to halt the implementation of a City ordinance dated December 17, 2009, which abolishes the BRT effective on October 1, 2010 (\u201cReorganization Ordinance\u201d); (2) a permanent injunction, equitable relief, and writs of mandamus and prohibition to halt the continued operation of a City ordinance dated April 22, 2010, which reduced the salaries and benefits of BRT members (\u201cSalary Ordinance\u201d); or, alternatively, (3) an order requiring immediate consideration by a lower court of its injunction and writ requests regarding the Reorganization and Salary Ordinances.\nPhiladelphia\u2019s BRT was created by statute in June 1939. Pursuant to law, for the next seventy years, the BRT\u2019s seven members were appointed for terms of six years by a majority of the judges serving on the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. See 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5341.1, 5341.2. The BRT assesses the value of real property in Philadelphia, examines tax returns, and hears appeals from assessments. See 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5341.7, 5341.8, 5341.11, 5341.14. In December 2009, the Philadelphia City Council adopted (and Mayor Michael A. Nutter signed) the Reorganization Ordinance, which aimed to abolish the BRT and replace it with two newly-created bodies, whose members would be appointed by the mayor with the consent of City Council. The BRT\u2019s functions would be divided between the new entities: the Office of Property Assessment, which would make initial and revised property assessments, and the Board of Property Assessment Appeals (\u201cBoard of Appeals\u201d), which would hear appeals from assessments. By its terms, the Reorganization Ordinance would come into effect on October 1, 2010, but only if ratified by the electorate at the May 2010 primary election, as required by 53 P.S. \u00a7 13132(d).\nIn March 2010, the BRT filed an application with this Court seeking exercise of our King\u2019s Bench power, and requesting that we enjoin submission to the electorate and placement on the ballot at the May 2010 primary election of a question intended to ratify the Reorganization Ordinance. On April 27, 2010, this Court denied BRT\u2019s application in a per curiam order. Board of Revision of Taxes v. City of Philadelphia, 993 A.2d 873 (Pa.2010). Subsequently, at the May 2010 primary election, the Philadelphia electorate approved the City\u2019s Reorganization Ordinance, and ripened the controversy.\nIn the meantime, City Council adopted (and Mayor Nutter signed) the Salary Ordinance, which: reduced the annual salaries of the BRT chair and secretary from $75,000 and $72,000 to $50,000 and $45,000, respectively; and eliminated annual salaries of $70,000 for the remaining BRT members and substituted per diem compensation of $150, tied to the members\u2019 actual attendance at hearings or meetings in furtherance of their duties. The Salary Ordinance became effective immediately after being signed by the Mayor, on April 22, 2010.\nOn June 15, 2010, the BRT and its members, individually and in their official capacities, filed a petition for review in the original jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court seeking to enjoin the Reorganization Ordinance, and requesting writs of prohibition, mandamus, and quo warranto, and other equitable relief. Furthermore, the BRT and its members asked for similar relief with regard to the Salary Ordinance, which had already reduced BRT members\u2019 salaries. After a hearing, on July 16, 2010, the Commonwealth Court dismissed BRT\u2019s petition for lack of jurisdiction. In an unpublished memorandum opinion, the court held that the BRT is a local \u2014 not a Commonwealth \u2014 agency and, therefore, the BRT and its members could not invoke the Commonwealth Court\u2019s original jurisdiction under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(a)(2). The Commonwealth Court transferred the matter to the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas.\nThe BRT and its members did not appeal the Commonwealth Court\u2019s transfer order. Instead, on July 26, 2010, the same petitioners filed with this Court the instant applications, in which they ask that we exercise our original jurisdiction or King\u2019s Bench power to grant them various forms of relief. For the reasons that follow, we exercise plenary jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 challenge under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 726, but only as to the Reorganization Ordinance, and we consider the case under submission on the existing pleadings. We enjoin the Reorganization Ordinance in part, insofar as it affects the BRT\u2019s appellate function. We hold that the remaining provisions of the Reorganization Ordinance, which we find are severable, are valid. We also hold that the BRT and its members must be stricken as petitioners to the extent they have sued in their official capacities. Finally, we dismiss petitioners\u2019 request to exercise extraordinary jurisdiction or King\u2019s Bench powers to review the Salary Ordinance, and will allow that challenge to proceed below in the ordinary course.\nI. The Reorganization Ordinance\nPetitioners request that we assume plenary jurisdiction over the action pending in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas and address the validity of the Reorganization Ordinance. Petitioners claim that the Reorganization Ordinance is invalid, particularly to the extent that the City transferred the BRT\u2019s appellate function to a body appointed by the Mayor and dissolved the BRT in its entirety. According to petitioners, the City\u2019s action has immediate public importance because it \u201csubject[s] the public to the jeopardy of voiding all appeals to [the] replacement Board\u201d and, in the future, would expose the public to \u201cmultiple appeals, delay and expense once the [BRT] is restored to its rightful role free from the ultra vires interference of the City.\u201d Petitioners further argue that, unless we act, the new appellate entity will be tainted by legal infirmities, \u201cthereby engendering public confusion and uncertainty, ... denying the due process of law to which the public is entitled, and ultimately eroding the public\u2019s confidence in the processes of government.\u201d Petitioners insist that \u201cthe general public\u2019s great interest in mandating the obedience of the City to the supreme statutory and Constitutional law of the Commonwealth\u201d should compel this Court to act now.\nOn the merits, petitioners claim that the City\u2019s action to abolish the BRT\u2019s appellate function in favor of creating the Board of Appeals was ultra vires and void. The crux of petitioners\u2019 argument is that the BRT\u2019s authority to entertain assessment appeals is recognized in the governing Pennsylvania legislation as a quasi-judicial function separate from the BRT\u2019s administrative or ministerial function of assessing the value of real property in Philadelphia. Citing 53 P.S. \u00a7 13132, petitioners contend that the General Assembly delegated to the City the power to reorganize, abolish, or transfer the BRT\u2019s ministerial function of assessing property values but not its authority to review appeals from those assessments. Section 13132(c) addresses the City\u2019s power to \u201cabolish\u201d as follows:\nSubject to the provisions of the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter and the First Class City Home Rule Act ... the Council of the City of Philadelphia shall have full powers to legislate with respect to the election, appointment, compensation, organization, abolition, merger, consolidation, powers, functions and duties of the Sheriff, City Commissioners, Registration Commission and Board of Revision of Taxes or its successor, with respect to the making of assessments of real and personal property as provided by act of Assembly.\n53 P.S. \u00a7 13132(c) (emphasis added). See 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5341.7-5341.8 (describing BRT\u2019s duty to supervise property value assessments made by assessors); \u00a7\u00a7 5341.14-5341.14a (describing BRT\u2019s appellate function).\nAccording to petitioners, the City\u2019s power under this provision is limited to reassigning the BRT\u2019s administrative function of making assessments, with the remaining function intentionally preserved by the General Assembly. See 53 P.S. \u00a7 13132(c); Pa. Const. Art. XV, \u00a7 1-5 (repealed; now at Pa. Const. Art. IX, \u00a7 2) (home rule and limits on local government). Petitioners observe that Section 13132(c) was adopted by the General Assembly in 1963 to complete the integration of former county offices and departments into City government following the consolidation of Philadelphia City and County offices, which began in 1951, and was intended to delineate the outer limits of the City\u2019s power with respect to offices, boards, and commissions previously associated with county government. See Pa. Const.. Art. XIV, \u00a7 8 (repealed and reenacted at Pa. Const. Art. IX, \u00a7 13) (abolition of county offices in Philadelphia). Petitioners also rely on Truscott v. City of Philadelphia, 380 Pa. 367, 111 A.2d 136 (1955), to support their position.\nTruscott involved a prior attempt by the City to abolish the BRT. This Court invalidated that effort based on a statutory provision which did not specifically address the BRT. The relevant provision \u2014 now codified at 53 P.S. \u00a7 13132(a) \u2014 vested in City Council the power to abolish \u201cthe Coroner, Recorder of Deeds, City Treasurer, Clerk of the Court of Quarter Sessions, Oyer and Terminer and General Jail Delivery and the Board of Inspectors of the Philadelphia County Prison.\u201d The City viewed this list as non-exclusive and passed an ordinance in August 1954 purporting to abolish the BRT. The Commonwealth, through the Attorney General, filed a complaint in equity in this Court to enjoin the ordinance as a usurpation of the General Assembly\u2019s power, and this Court held that the City\u2019s ordinance indeed was unconstitutional and void. 111 A.2d at 141. Similar to the Commonwealth in Truscott, petitioners argue here that, in plain language, the City has no power under Section 13132(c) to abolish the BRT completely or to reassign its appellate function. Petitioners claim that the City\u2019s action to that effect was ultra vires and, therefore, the Reorganization Ordinance is void in that respect. Petitioners further assert that the legislative history of Section 13132(c), including floor debate between the proponent of a BRT-specific amendment to the provision and an opponent of the amendment, fully supports this position.\nFinally, according to petitioners, the City\u2019s action is not a mere violation of governing legislation but also usurps the statutory power of the Judiciary to make appointments to the BRT. Pursuant to 72 P.S. \u00a7 5341.2, \u201call appointments of members of the [BRT] shall be made by a majority of the judges of the courts of common pleas of [Philadelphia C]ounty.\u201d The Reorganization Ordinance eliminates the appointment power of the Judiciary and transfers that power to the City\u2019s executive branch. See Reorganization Ordinance \u00a7 2-302(3). In addition, the Ordinance voids the judicial six-year appointments of the present BRT members. Petitioners argue that both actions infringe on the power of the Judiciary and impugn its legislatively-ordained role, in this instance, as a co-equal branch. Furthermore, petitioners claim that the General Assembly expressed its clear intent that judicial involvement in the appointment of BRT members was warranted. According to petitioners, the transfer of the appointment power is a departure from that express intent and undermines the \u201celement of independence\u201d which the Legislature sought to ensure respecting the BRT\u2019s appellate role by providing for judicial, rather than political, appointment of its members.\nPetitioners allege that they have a clear right to relief, that no adequate remedy at law for damages is available, and that they and the public will suffer irreparable harm if this Court does not exercise jurisdiction and enjoin the Reorganization Ordinance before it takes effect. In the alternative, petitioners seek a writ of quo warranto challenging \u201cthe false claim of title and right for the replacement entity\u201d and its members, a writ of prohibition barring the City from effectuating the Reorganization Ordinance, and a writ of mandamus compelling the City to comply with Section 13132(c).\nIn response, the City concurs in petitioners\u2019 request that this Court exercise jurisdiction over the challenge to the validity of the Reorganization Ordinance. The City agrees with petitioners that the matter presents an issue of immediate public importance in Philadelphia and that \u201cthere would be great public advantage to an early and final resolution of this dispute.\u201d According to the City, an accelerated decision on the merits will dispel any \u201cuncertainty in the minds of the public (whose properties will be subject to assessment by the new agencies) and in the minds of the City officials exercising that assessment authority.\u201d\nNext, the City raises several preliminary objections to petitioners\u2019 application. The first objection amounts to a procedural matter. The City asserts that the BRT and its members acting in their official capacities must be stricken as parties to this lawsuit because, as a city agency and city officials, they are prohibited (1) from filing a legal action with private representation, pursuant to the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, 351 Pa.Code \u00a7\u00a7 4.4-400 and 8.8-410, and/or (2) from filing a legal action without adequate ratification under the Sunshine Act, 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 708. According to the City, the only proper parties to the action are the members of the BRT in their individual capacities.\nThe second objection is in the nature of a demurrer. The City argues that the General Assembly authorized Philadelphia\u2019s City Council to abolish the BRT completely, without any reservation of authority over the BRT\u2019s \u201cappellate function.\u201d The City claims that the reference in Section 13132(c) to the \u201cmaking of assessments\u201d is a description of the BRT\u2019s entire role, from its initial valuation process to its appellate review of assessments. In support of this argument, the City finds evidence in 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-518.1 that the General Assembly uses the term \u201cassessments\u201d as a generic term for the entire administrative process, including the appeal function of the BRT. See 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-518.1 (provision titled \u201cAppeal to court from assessments\u201d allows property owner to appeal BRT\u2019s appellate decision to court of common pleas). The City also adverts to other legislation and court decisions that likewise utilize the term \u201cassessment\u201d to mean both the initial valuation stage and the appellate stage of the BRT\u2019s function. See, e.g., 72 P.S. \u00a7 5341.14 (describing procedure for administrative appeal to BRT); 53 P.S. \u00a7 13133(a)(9) (city shall not enlarge or limit powers granted by acts of General Assembly that provide \u201cfor the assessment of real or personal property and persons for taxation purposes\u201d); Appeals of Mathies Coal Co., 435 Pa. 129, 255 A.2d 906 (1969) (referring to BRT\u2019s appellate decision as \u201ca tax-assessment\u201d); Appeal of Rieck Ice Cream Co., 417 Pa. 249, 209 A.2d 383 (1965) (same). Indeed, the City argues, when a court wishes to distinguish between an initial assessment and the BRT\u2019s final assessment after administrative appeal, it refers to the two stages in those terms, recognizing that \u201cassessment\u201d refers to the entire process. See, e.g., Deitch Co. v. Bd. of Prop. Assessment, 417 Pa. 213, 209 A.2d 397 (1965). As a final argument, the City postulates that, given its power to abolish the BRT, it would be \u201can odd choice\u201d if the City were only authorized to \u201cabolish\u201d the BRT in part.\nThe City also responds to petitioners\u2019 claim that the General Assembly deliberately intended to preserve the appellate function of the BRT because of its kinship with the judicial process. According to the City, the BRT\u2019s appellate role \u201cis not particularly judicial in nature\u201d given that its factual findings are subject to review de novo by the court of common pleas. Further, the City argues that judicial appointment of BRT\u2019s members is not a prerequisite to preserving any quasi-judicial nature of the BRT, given that other boards, like zoning boards for example, are appointed by local city councils. According to the City, petitioners have not demonstrated \u201cany particularly important\u201d non-textual reason \u201cto preserve the court appointment aspect of the BRT\u2019s appellate function, while simultaneously allowing the elimination of the court appointment function of the BRT\u2019s initial valuation function.\u201d\nMoreover, the City claims, the views of individual lawmakers involved in legislative floor debate cannot trump the actual statutory language finally voted upon and approved by the General Assembly in Section 13132(c). See, e.g., McCormick v. Columbus Conveyer Co., 522 Pa. 520, 564 A.2d 907, 910 n. 1 (1989) (\u201cwhat is said in debate, the remarks and understanding of individual legislators, is not relevant in ascertaining the meaning of a statute\u201d). The City argues that \u201cthere is no way to know how many members of the General Assembly even were present to hear the views of the few vocal members\u201d who referred to separate assessment and appeal functions of the BRT. According to the City, the plain language of Section 13132(c), as well as \u201clogic,\u201d weighs in favor of finding the Reorganization Ordinance a valid exercise of City Council\u2019s authority to abolish the BRT.\nIn the alternative, if we find that City Council was not authorized to abolish the entire BRT, the City requests that we sever the offending portions of the Reorganization Ordinance and allow the unchallenged balance of the ordinance, governing the making of initial and revised assessments, to stand.\nA. Jurisdiction\nThe threshold question is whether this Court should exercise jurisdiction to review petitioners\u2019 challenge to the validity of the Reorganization Ordinance presently, or allow it to travel in its ordinary course of litigation. This Court may assume, at its discretion, plenary jurisdiction over a matter of immediate public importance that is pending before another court of this Commonwealth. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 726. Although employed to similar effect, our extraordinary jurisdiction is distinct from our King\u2019s Bench jurisdiction, which allows us to exercise power of general superintendency over inferior tribunals even when no matter is pending before a lower court. In re Dauphin County Fourth Investigating Grand Jury, 596 Pa. 378, 943 A.2d 929 (2007). Where, as here, an action between the same parties regarding the same issue is pending in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, the appropriate request is for the exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction and we will treat petitioners\u2019 application as such. Id. at 933 n. 3.\nIn exercising our discretion regarding whether to assume plenary jurisdiction, this Court considers the immediacy and public importance of the issues raised. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 726. Plenary jurisdiction is invoked sparingly and only in circumstances where the record clearly demonstrates the petitioners\u2019 rights. Commonwealth v. Morris, 565 Pa. 1, 771 A.2d 721, 731 (2001); Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. v. Jerome, 478 Pa. 484, 387 A.2d 425, 430 n. 11 (1978). However, \u201c[e]ven a clear showing that a petitioner is aggrieved does not assure that this Court will exercise its discretion to grant the requested relief.\u201d 387 A.2d at 430 n. 11.\nWe agree with the BRT and the City that this case warrants assumption of plenary jurisdiction over the challenge to the Reorganization Ordinance. This is not a garden variety dispute, but a case having its genesis in the City\u2019s decision to revamp the existing agency performing property assessments. It is of interest not only to the BRT\u2019s members, who face elimination of their roles, but also to the City, to all City property tax payers, and to the Judiciary, whose appointment power is alleged to have been eliminated. It is in the public\u2019s interest that a prompt and final determination be rendered on the issue of whether the BRT (or the new Board of Appeals) will perform the BRT\u2019s current appellate function so as to maintain continuity and a working system of local taxation and revenue collection in the City. A clear final ruling before the Reorganization Ordinance would come into effect in October 2010 will insulate the decisions of the local agency performing the appeal function from collateral attack and provide a surer prospect of finality to parties in appeals from assessments. Swift resolution of this matter will also promote confidence in the authority and integrity of our state and local institutions. See generally Stilp v. Commonwealth, 588 Pa. 539, 905 A.2d 918 (2006) (Court assumed plenary jurisdiction over constitutional challenge to legislation that tied salaries of state officials to those of federal officials); Perzel v. Cortes, 582 Pa. 103, 870 A.2d 759 (Pa.2005) (Court assumed plenary jurisdiction to review rejection by Commonwealth\u2019s Secretary of election writ issued by House Speaker; rejection was an act unsupported by constitutional or statutory authority); Ieropoli v. AC & S Corp., 577 Pa. 138, 842 A.2d 919 (2004) (Court assumed plenary jurisdiction over challenge to constitutionality of statute which extinguished appellants\u2019 causes of action that had accrued before statute was enacted); Silver v. Downs, 493 Pa. 50, 425 A.2d 359, 362 (1981) (Court assumed plenary jurisdiction over interlocutory appeal from order disqualifying township solicitor from representing township officers). That the validity of the Reorganization Ordinance is of immediate pub-lie concern is, therefore, beyond contest. Further, there is no factual dispute; the issue is one of law, resolvable on the pleadings. And, finally, as discussed in detail infra, the record demonstrates that petitioners have a clear right to relief. Consequently, our exercise of plenary jurisdiction here is proper.\nB. Authority to Bring Suit\nWe turn next to the City\u2019s claim that the BRT and BRT members acting in their official capacities have no authority at law to bring this action. Petitioners do not dispute the claim. We agree. Pursuant to Philadelphia\u2019s Home Rule Charter, the BRT and its members \u2014 as a City agency and its officers \u2014 must receive approval from the City Solicitor to proceed in this action with private representation. Section 8-410 of the Charter provides that it \u201cshall be unlawful for any officer, department, board or commission to engage any attorney to represent him or it in any matter or thing relating to his or its public business without the approval in writing of the City Solicitor.\u201d 351 Pa.Code \u00a7 8.8-410 (emphasis added); Lennox v. Clark, 372 Pa. 355, 93 A.2d 834 (1953) (BRT member is City officer and, pursuant to Home Rule Charter, may not engage private attorney to represent him in matter related to public business without approval of City Solicitor). See Silver v. Dilworth, 403 Pa. 645, 170 A.2d 575 (1961) (Home Rule Charter did not preclude Mayor\u2019s appointment of special counsel where Mayor received approval from City Solicitor). Further, the City Solicitor has a duty by law to represent \u201cthe City and every officer, department, board or commission in all litigation.\u201d See 351 Pa.Code \u00a7 4.4-400(b). As this Court has recognized, the \u201crequirement that all the [C]ity departments should rely upon the City Solicitor for advice is obviously a wise one, since it is important that there be a unified, consistent interpretation of legal situations arising under the administration of the city government, which might not be the case if there were individual solicitors for the different departments.\u201d Lennox, 93 A.2d at 840 (footnote omitted).\nHere, petitioners admitted in earlier litigation that they requested permission from the City Solicitor to hire private counsel in this matter, but that the request was denied. See BRT\u2019s Answer to Motion to Strike, 32 EM 2010, at 6-7. Their action here clearly does not have the \u201capproval in writing of the City Solicitor\u201d required by Section 8-410 of the Home Rule Charter. We therefore hold that the BRT and BRT members acting in their official capacities must be stricken as petitioners in this action. The only petitioners remaining in this suit are the BRT members acting in their individual capacities. As noted previously, the City does not challenge the BRT members\u2019 right to proceed individually in this action, and so this determination does not impede our power to proceed to the merits.\nC. Abolition of the BRT and Reassignment of the BRT\u2019s Appellate Function to the Newly-Formed Board of Appeals\nWe now consider the merits of the individual petitioners\u2019 claim that the Reorganization Ordinance was ultra vires and invalid. Essentially, we must determine whether the General Assembly authorized the City to abolish the BRT\u2019s appellate, or adjudicative, function. This is a question of statutory interpretation, decided as a matter of law on the existing pleadings. Commonwealth v. Janssen Pharmaceutica, Inc., 2 A.3d 474 (Pa.2010); Kilmer v. Elexco Land Servs., Inc., 990 A.2d 1147, 1151, 1158 (Pa.2010).\n\u201cThe object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly. Every statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a); Commonwealth v. McCoy, 599 Pa. 599, 962 A.2d 1160, 1167-68 (2009). A statute\u2019s plain language generally provides the best indication of legislative intent. McCoy, 962 A.2d at 1166; Ephrata Area Sch. Dist. v. County of Lancaster, 595 Pa. 111, 938 A.2d 264, 271 (2007); Pennsylvania Fin. Responsibility Assigned Claims Plan v. English, 541 Pa. 424, 664 A.2d 84, 87 (1995) (\u201cWhere the words of a statute are clear and free from ambiguity the legislative intent is to be gleaned from those very words.\u201d). Only where the words of a statute are not explicit will we resort to other considerations to discern legislative intent. Ephrata Area Sch. Dist., supra; see also 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c); In re Canvass of Absentee Ballots of Nov. 4 2003 Gen. Election, 577 Pa. 231, 843 A.2d 1223, 1230 (2004). Moreover, in this analysis, \u201c[w]e are not permitted to ignore the language of a statute, nor may we deem any language to be superfluous.\u201d McCoy, 962 A.2d at 1168. Governing presumptions are that the General Assembly intended the entire statute at issue to be effective and certain, and that the General Assembly does not intend an absurd result or one that is impossible of execution. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1)-(2).\nWe are also mindful that statutes which relate to the same persons or things must be construed together as one statute. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1932. \u201c[S]ections of a statute must be read together and in conjunction with each other, and construed with reference to the entire statute.\u201d Housing Auth. of County of Chester v. Pa. State Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, 556 Pa. 621, 730 A.2d 935, 945 (1999). A word or phrase whose meaning is clear when used in one section of a statute will be construed to mean the same thing in another section of the same statute. Id. at 946.\nAs stated, the relevant statutory language provides: Council of the City of Philadelphia shall have full powers to legislate with respect to the election, appointment, compensation, organization, abolition, merger, consolidation, powers, functions and duties of the Sheriff, City Commissioners, Registration Commission and Board of Revision of Taxes or its successor, with respect to the making of assessments of real and personal property as provided by act of Assembly.\n53 P.S. \u00a7 13132(c). Petitioners concede that subsection (c) permits the City to reassign to another entity (in this case, the Office of Property Assessment) the BRT\u2019s ministerial function to make initial property assessments and revise them, but challenge the authority of the City, pursuant to the same subsection, to abolish and reassign the BRT\u2019s appellate function to the newly-created Board of Appeals, and to eliminate the BRT entirely as a result. The City responds that it has authority pursuant to subsection (c) to reassign all of the BRT\u2019s present tasks to the newly-created entities and to abolish the BRT in its entirety. The City\u2019s view is based on the proposition that the term \u201cmaking of assessments,\u201d as used in Section 13132(c), includes both the BRT\u2019s ministerial and adjudicative duties. After review, we conclude that the City\u2019s interpretation is not supported by the plain language of the statute and we find that the Reorganization Ordinance is invalid in part. Pursuant to the plain language of Section 13132(c), Philadelphia City Council has unqualified authority over the local offices of Sheriff, City Commissioner, and Registration Commission, including the power to abolish them. In contrast, the General Assembly singles out one entity, the BRT, and qualifies the delegation of power to City Council. The power conveyed is only \u201cwith respect to the making of assessments of real and personal property as provided by act of Assembly.\u201d Petitioners\u2019 interpretation reflects this significant, but curtailed, grant of power and gives effect to the actual language of the entire provision. By comparison, the City\u2019s interpretation and construction of Section 13132(c) is that the qualifier comprises the entirety of the BRT\u2019s function. But if that were so, the qualifier would be entirely superfluous. In limiting the delegated power only to that part of the BRT\u2019s function which involves \u201cthe making of real and personal property assessments,\u201d the General Assembly obviously contemplated that it was preserving some other part of the BRT\u2019s function.\nThis does not entirely answer the question before us, however. Acknowledging that the General Assembly intended to retain power over some function of the BRT, the question is whether it is clear, as petitioners would have it, that the General Assembly intended to reserve power over the BRT\u2019s \u201cappellate function.\u201d To this extent, the statute may be viewed as ambiguous, calling for construction. See Delaware County v. First Union Corp., 992 A.2d 112, 118-19 (Pa.2010). In this analysis, we may consider, inter alia, the occasion and necessity for the statute, the circumstances under which it was enacted, the object to be attained, and contemporaneous legislative history. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(1)-(2), (4), (7); Kirsch v. Pub. Sch. Employees\u2019 Ret. Bd., 603 Pa. 439, 985 A.2d 671, 676 (2009); Hannaberry HVAC v. W.C.A.B. (Snyder, Jr.), 575 Pa.66, 834 A.2d 524, 533 (2003) (citing legislative history supporting Court\u2019s interpretation); DeLellis v. Borough of Verona, 541 Pa. 3, 660 A.2d 25, 31 n. 11 (1995) (same).\nIn addition to accounting for the qualifier found in the plain language of the statute, petitioners\u2019 construction of Section 13132(c) fits neatly into the larger statutory context within which the BRT operates and does not lead to an absurd result. Section 13132(c) is a provision of the General Assembly\u2019s Home Rule Act. Via the Home Rule Act, the General Assembly empowered the City to adopt a home rule charter and delegated certain of its legislative powers to City Council. See generally 53 P.S. \u00a7 13132(a)-(d). The General Assembly transferred legislative power to City Council over the items delineated in Section 13132(a) in 1953 and in Section 13132(c) in 1963, completing consolidation of City and County government. See Pa. Const. Art. XIV, \u00a7 8 (repealed, now at Pa. Const. Art. IX, \u00a7 13). The delegation of power to the City is specific, not general, and is limited to the items listed in Section 13132. See Truscott, 111 A.2d at 136^10 (Philadelphia City Council had no power to abolish BRT without grant of power by General Assembly because municipalities are not sovereigns and have no original or fundamental power of legislation). In Philadelphia \u2014 the only county of the first class presently \u2014 the powers of the BRT are specified in several statutes codified at 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5341.1-5341.21, under the title \u201cAssessments in Counties of the First Class.\u201d\nThe statutory scheme provides, as the parties agree, for essentially a two-step property value assessment process. First, the BRT issues annual precepts to assessors and the assessors, upon receipt of precepts, value each property and return valuations to the BRT. 72 P.S. \u00a7 5341.7; see 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-401(a) (in Philadelphia, BRT shall require appointed assessors \u201cto make annual assessments\u201d). Assessors are local officials appointed and supervised by the BRT. 72 P.S. \u00a7 5341.4. The BRT then examines the returns and, if necessary, revises valuations to rectify errors and complete omitted valuations. 72 P.S. \u00a7 5341.8. Second, the BRT hears appeals filed by any person \u201caggrieved by any assessment ... fixed following revision of assessments by the [BRT].\u201d 72 P.S. \u00a7 5341.14. The BRT\u2019s decision regarding the administrative appeal is in turn appealable de novo to the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas. 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-518.1; 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 933(a)(2) (relating to appeals from local government agencies). \u201cThe assessments made by the assessors, as revised and supplemented by the [BRT], subject to appeal therefrom as hereinafter in this act provided, ... constitute the assessed value for tax purposes.\u201d 72 P.S. \u00a7 5341.8.\nAgainst this background, the General Assembly\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cmaking of assessments\u201d in Section 13132(c) logically suggests the ministerial first step of the property value assessment process. The appellate function, although integral to the local taxation process, is a distinctly quasi-judicial review function of the BRT. Cf. Rogers v. Pa. Bd. of Prob. and Parole, 555 Pa. 285, 724 A.2d 319 (1999) (distinguishing between agency\u2019s ministerial and adjudicative functions); Kennedy v. Upper Milford Twp. Zoning Hearing Bd., 575 Pa. 105, 834 A.2d 1104, 1114 (2003) (local agencies that perform formal fact-finding and deliberative functions in a manner similar to that of a court are quasi-judicial bodies). Indeed, City Council implicitly recognized this distinction by reassigning the two functions along the same line of demarcation to two newly-formed entities, the Office of Property Assessments and the Board of Appeals. According to the Reorganization Ordinance, the primary function of the Office of Property Assessments is to \u201cmake or supervise the making of all assessments,\u201d while the primary function of the Board of Appeals is to \u201cprovide for hearings, and make decisions, in all cases of appeals from assessments.\u201d Reorganization Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 2\u2014 303(1), 2-305(2)(a).\nLegislative history also supports petitioners\u2019 interpretation. Petitioners attach several pages from the Legislative Journal, containing the transcript of debates dated July 9, 1963, in which individual legislators discussed their understanding of the meaning of Section 13132(c). Petitioners quote the statements of Representative A.M. Lee, who proposed amending Section 13132(c) as follows:\nCouncil of the City of Philadelphia shall have full powers to legislate with respect to the election, appointment, compensation, organization, abolition, merger, consolidation, powers, functions and duties of the Sheriff, City Commissioners, Board-of-Revision -of \u2014 Taxes, and Registration Commission and Board of Revision of Taxes or its successor, with respect to the making of assessments of real and personal property as provided by act of Assembly.\n1963 Pa. Leg. J. 1311-12 (July 9, 1963) (deletions are indicated by a strikethrough and additions are indicated by italics). The amendment was adopted precisely as proposed by Representative Lee and that is the language still governing today. The amendment is significant because the original language authorized unlimited power over the BRT, including the power to abolish the BRT entirely, just as that power was conferred respecting the Sheriff, City Commissioners, and Registration Commission. The amendment, however, limited the City\u2019s powers of abolition, organization, etc., to the BRT\u2019s function of \u201cmaking of assessments.\u201d As the author of the amendment, Representative Lee\u2019s comments are significant. Representative Lee stated:\nMy amendments [to Section 13132(c) ] would say that as to the assessment function, in the first instance that function is within the scope of the grant of authority to city council contained in this bill; however, excepted from that grant of authority would be the latter two functions which I mentioned, the hearing of appeals from assessments and the functions as providing members of the boards of view in the City of Philadelphia.[]\nThe reason for these amendments [to Section 13132(c) ] is that in performing the appeal function and the board of view function[,] the [BRT] is performing a quasi-judicial function and from their [sic] actions appeals lie to the courts of common pleas. And since they are quasi-judicial functions, it appears proper that these functions should be performed by an agency appointed by the courts of common pleas in the city of Philadelphia in accordance with existing practice.\n1963 Pa. Leg. J. 1312 (July 9, 1963) (emphasis added). See P.L. 795, \u00a7 1 of August 13, 1963, amending P.L. 1476, \u00a7 2 of August 26, 1953. A second speaker, Representative Fineman of Philadelphia, while criticizing the reason for the amendment, confirmed the line of separation regarding the BRT\u2019s distinct functions:\nThis is more properly not an endeavor or an attempt to protect the public, the property owners of the city of Philadelphia, by separating the taxing power, or rather the assessment-making power[,] and the appeal provisions of the law, but rather a cynical attempt to insure [sic] the continuation of political patronage to the Republican Party in the city of Philadelphia.\n1963 Pa. Leg. J. 1315 (July 9,1963) (emphasis added).\nPolitics of the above debate aside, the comments recorded in the Legislative Journal confirm the BRT\u2019s interpretation of the statute, particularly in light of both sides\u2019 recognition that the BRT performs multiple functions. Both the proponent and an opponent of the Lee amendment perceived the language at issue in this appeal as reserving the power of the General Assembly with regard to abolishment of the BRT and reassignment of its review power. This common understanding confirms that the General Assembly intended this meaning of the statute.\nFinally, and again leaving aside the politics of the legislative debate, it is fairly plausible to believe that the statutory qualification also recognized the value of interposing some role for the local Judiciary with respect to the BRT\u2019s \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d appeal function. We recognize the City\u2019s argument that members of other local agencies performing quasi-judicial functions are appointed exclusively by the executive branch, see, e.g., 53 P.S. \u00a7 14757 (mayoral appointment of members to zoning commission), but that point assumes that the General Assembly is obliged to view all such Philadelphia agencies as warranting identical treatment. That clearly is the prerogative of the General Assembly, which in this particular instance singled out the BRT for different treatment. In summary, we find supporting merit in the argument, made by petitioners, that the General Assembly sought to ensure a measure of independence in the BRT by placing appointment of its members in the hands of the Judiciary, and reserving its appellate, quasi-judicial role. Cf. In re Cicchetti, 560 Pa. 183, 743 A.2d 431 (2000) (generally discussing Judiciary\u2019s independence within political system).\nFor all of these reasons, we conclude that petitioners\u2019 interpretation must prevail. See McCoy, 962 A.2d at 1168. City Council\u2019s transfer of the BRT\u2019s adjudicative function to the Board of Appeals was not authorized by the legislative delegation of power afforded in Section 13132(c) and was ultra vires. See Truscott, supra (City ordinance abolishing BRT was void because statutory language was clear that City was not authorized to abolish BRT and City had no power to abolish BRT without grant of power by General Assembly). Consequently, we hold that the Reorganization Ordinance is invalid in part.\nD. Relief\nIn their application to this Court, petitioners request injunctive relief or, alternatively, writs of mandamus, prohibition, and quo warranto to halt the implementation of the Reorganization Ordinance. In Pennsylvania, a permanent injunction will issue if the party establishes his or her clear right to relief. \u201c[T]he party need not establish either irreparable harm or immediate relief,\u201d as is necessary when seeking a preliminary injunction, and \u201ca court may issue a final injunction if such relief is necessary to prevent a legal wrong for which there is no adequate redress at law.\u201d Buffalo Twp. v. Jones, 571 Pa. 637, 813 A.2d 659, 663 (2002).\nFurther, we may issue writs of mandamus and/or prohibition where a petitioner has a clear legal right, the responding public official has a corresponding duty, and no other adequate and appropriate remedy at law exists. See Delaware River Port Auth. v. Thornburgh, 508 Pa. 11, 493 A.2d 1351, 1355 (1985) (mandamus); Philadelphia Newspapers, supra, 387 A.2d at 430 (prohibition). The writ of mandamus compels official performance of a ministerial act or mandatory duty, see Thornburgh, 493 A.2d at 1355, while a writ of prohibition restrains an offending official \u201cfrom continuing ... unwarranted conduct when continuation threatens imminent harm to the individual on whose behalf the writ is issued,\u201d Philadelphia Newspapers, 387 A.2d at 430 n. 11. Finally, a writ of quo warranto is a means by which to test title or right to public office. Pennsylvania Attorney Gen. Corbett v. Griffin, 596 Pa. 549, 946 A.2d 668, 672 n. 2 (2008). \u201cA complaint in quo warranto is aimed at the right to exercise the powers of the office, which is a public injury, rather than an attack upon the propriety of the actions performed while in office, which would be a private injury.\u201d Judicial Conduct Bd. v. Griffin, 591 Pa. 351, 918 A.2d 87, 93 (2007).\nPreliminarily, we note that a request for a writ of quo warranto is not appropriate here, where petitioners do not directly challenge any individual person\u2019s right to public office, and indeed have not named and served any such individual, but instead are testing the validity of a City Council ordinance. Petitioners, however, have established their clear right to relief and that an adequate remedy at law does not exist. As a result, a permanent injunction is appropriate. In light of this disposition, we dismiss the request for a preliminary injunction, and the alternative requests for writs of mandamus and prohibition as moot.\nThe scope of the permanent injunction is limited, as we agree with the City that the offending portions of the Reorganization Ordinance are severable. Although petitioners do not address the issue of severability directly, they do concede that the Reorganization Ordinance is valid insofar as it reassigns the function of making assessments to the newly-formed Office of Property Assessment. \u201c[T]he severance principle has its roots in a jurisprudential doctrine ... and the standard itself reflects the experience of the common law.\u201d Stilp, 905 A.2d at 972. Generally, if the provision of a statute \u2014 or, as here, an ordinance \u2014 is found invalid, the remainder of the legislative act will not be affected by the invalidity unless we find that the valid provisions \u201care so essentially and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provision\u201d that it cannot be presumed that the legislating body \u201cwould have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one; or unless the court finds that the remaining valid provisions, standing alone, are incomplete and are incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.\u201d Id. at 970 (quoting 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1925). Here, the provisions creating the Office of Property Assessment and separating its functions from the BRT stand independently, are complete, and are capable of being placed into effect in accordance with the intent of City Council and the Philadelphia electorate, which ratified them. Accordingly, we issue a permanent injunction with respect to the following provisions of the Reorganization Ordinance, exclusively:\n\u2014 Section 1, purporting to amend Title 2, \u00a7 2-113 of the Philadelphia Code, insofar as it abolishes the BRT with respect to its appellate function;\n\u2014 Section 1, purporting to amend Title 2 of the Philadelphia Code by adding \u00a7\u00a7 2-301 to 2-303;\n\u2014 Section 1, purporting to amend Title 2 of the Philadelphia Code, insofar as it transfers BRT employees to the Board of Appeals; and\n\u2014 Section 1, purporting to amend Title 2 of the Philadelphia Code, insofar as it makes any reference to the Board of Appeals rather than the BRT performing the BRT\u2019s appellate function.\nII. The Salary Ordinance\nPetitioners separately request that we exercise jurisdiction over their challenge to the validity of the Salary Ordinance. They claim that, in its bid to abolish and replace the BRT, the City expanded the controversy regarding the dissolution of the BRT \u201cto directly and immediately produce destructive effects upon the [BRT] and its individual officials.\u201d According to petitioners, the Salary Ordinance amounts to a public \u201cconstructive discharge\u201d of BRT members in the middle of their terms of appointment. They also claim that the City\u2019s action flouted the Pennsylvania Constitution and this Court\u2019s recent decision prohibiting municipalities from diminishing the \u201csalary or emoluments\u201d of public officials after their appointment. See Pa. Const. Art. III, \u00a7 27; Buckwalter v. Borough of Phoenixville, 603 Pa. 534, 985 A.2d 728 (2009). Petitioners postulate that the present matter is of immediate public importance because \u201ceach day that this open offense is allowed to continue\u201d is an affront to \u201cthe public\u2019s right to conduct by the City obedient to the Constitution of Pennsylvania\u201d and to the affected individuals\u2019 rights. Petitioners also insist that no action at law for damages exists that would remedy the City\u2019s unconstitutional conduct and remove the stigma placed on the City by its unconstitutional ordinance. Petitioners request an injunction to halt the application of the Salary Ordinance as well as an \u201cequitable award of back pay.\u201d\nThe City responds that the validity of the Salary Ordinance is a separate issue and does not raise the same immediate public concerns as petitioners\u2019 first claim. In the City\u2019s view, the Salary Ordinance dispute is individual to petitioners and should proceed in the normal course, beginning with factual and legal determinations by the court of common pleas. The City notes that it may raise fact-bound issues in response to petitioners\u2019 claim, serve discovery, and file a counterclaim, all of which are \u201cmore appropriate for resolution in a trial court.\u201d\nWe agree with the City that this matter is more properly relegated to the court of common pleas in the first instance. The parties\u2019 dispute over the propriety of reducing BRT members\u2019 salaries, while important, does not require accelerated review by this Court out of the ordinary course, nor are petitioners\u2019 arguments regarding the public importance of the issue they present particularly compelling, such that exercise of this Court\u2019s extraordinary jurisdiction would be appropriate. See Vaccone v. Syken, 587 Pa. 380, 899 A.2d 1103, 1108 (2006) (circumstances of disqualification of petitioner\u2019s counsel not extreme, or unusual, or of such public importance, that general rule regarding sparing use of extraordinary jurisdiction would not apply). Accordingly, petitioners\u2019 request for the exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction or King\u2019s Bench Power in this regard is denied, and thus we do not pass upon the requests for injunctive and equitable relief, and for writs of mandamus and prohibition to halt the continued operation of the City\u2019s Salary Ordinance.\nIII. Conclusion and Mandate\nWe hold that the Philadelphia City Council Ordinance dated December 17, 2009, amending Title 2 of the Philadelphia Code with respect to the functions and existence of the BRT, violates the General Assembly\u2019s Public Law 795, \u00a7 1 of Aug. 13, 1963, see 53 P.S. \u00a7 13132(c), insofar as it eliminates the BRT\u2019s quasi-judicial appellate function and abolishes the BRT entirely, replacing it with the newly-created Board of Property Assessment Appeals. We also find that the invalid provisions are severable from the remainder of the Ordinance. The Ordinance provisions amending Title 2 of the Philadelphia Code, which relate solely to the BRT\u2019s administrative or ministerial function of making assessments, remain in force.\nAccordingly, it is ordered that the Mayor of the City of Philadelphia, the City Council of Philadelphia, and their officers, agents and employees, are hereby restrained and enjoined from carrying into effect or enforcing any of the following provisions of the Ordinance:\n(1) Section 1, purporting to amend Title 2, \u00a7 2-113 of the Philadelphia Code, insofar as it abolishes the BRT with respect to its appellate function;\n(2) Section 1, purporting to amend Title 2 of the Philadelphia Code by adding \u00a7\u00a7 2-301 to 2-303;\n(3) Section 1, purporting to amend Title 2 of the Philadelphia Code, insofar as it transfers BRT employees to the Board of Appeals; and\n(4) Section 1, purporting to amend Title 2 of the Philadelphia Code, insofar as it makes any reference to the Board of Appeals rather than the BRT performing the BRT\u2019s appellate function.\nPetitioners\u2019 requests for a preliminary injunction and the alternate remedies of quo warranto, prohibition, and mandamus are dismissed.\nWith respect to the Philadelphia City Council Ordinance dated April 22, 2010, amending Section 20-304 of the Philadelphia Code, we decline to exercise plenary jurisdiction. The dispute can proceed in the ordinary course in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas.\nIt is so ordered.\nAPPENDIX A\n(Bill No. 090706)\nAN ORDINANCE\nAmending Title 2 of The Philadelphia Code, entitled \u201cCity-County Consolidation,\u201d by abolishing the Board of Revision of Taxes, by creating an Office of Property Assessment which shall have the powers, functions and duties of the Board of Revision of Taxes with respect to the initial making of property assessments; by assigning certain duties to the Department of Records (as the successor to the Recorder of Deeds) with respect to filing certain information with the new Office of Property Assessment; by creating a new Board of Property Assessment Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d), which shall have the powers, functions and duties of the Board of Revision of Taxes with respect to appeals from property assessments; and by creating a Board of Property Assessment Appeals Nominating Panel to nominate candidates for appointment to the Board; and providing for submission of such amendment for the approval or disapproval of the qualified electors of the City of Philadelphia; fixing the date of a special election for such purpose; prescribing the form of ballot question to be voted on; and authorizing the appropriate officers to publish notice and to make arrangements for the special election; all under certain terms and conditions.\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA HEREBY ORDAINS:\nSECTION 1.

Decker\nChief Clerk of the City Council\n(Bill No. 100212)\nAN ORDINANCE\nAmending Section 20-304, entitled \u201cCompensation for Members of Boards, Commissions, Committees and Councils,\u201d by revising the compensation for members of the Board of Revision of Taxes, under certain terms and conditions.\nTHE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA HEREBY ORDAINS:\nSECTION 1. Section 20-304 of The Philadelphia Code is amended to read as follows:\n\u00a7 20-304. Compensation for Members of Boards, Commissions, Committees and Councils.\n(7) Board of Revision of Taxes. [Each member of the Board of Revision of Taxes shall receive an annual salary of seventy thousand ($70,000) dollars.] The Secretary of the Board of Revision of Taxes shall receive an annual salary of [seventy two thousand ($72,000) ] forty five thousand dollars ($45,000). The Chairman of the Board of Revision of Taxes shall receive an annual salary of [seventy five thousand ($75,-000) ] fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). Each remaining member of the Board shall receive one hundred and fifty dollars ($150) as compensation for each day the member attends a Board meeting or hearing or both, or such higher amount as required by law, but in no case more than forty-thousand dollars ($40,000) per year.\nSECTION 2. This Ordinance shall be effective immediately.\nExplanation:\n[Brackets] indicate matter deleted.\nItalics indicate new matter added.\nCERTIFICATION: This is a true and correct copy of the original Bill, Passed by the City Council on April 22, 2010. The Bill was Signed by the Mayor on April 22, 2010.\n/s/ Michael A. Decker\nMichael A. Decker\nChief Clerk of the City Council\n. Petitioners explain that their application for \"Exercise of Original Jurisdiction\u201d is actually a request pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 726 (\"Extraordinary Jurisdiction\u201d). Petitioners\u2019 Application, at \u00b6 9.\n. The Reorganization and Salary Ordinances are attached to this Opinion as Appendix A.\n. P.L. 1199, \u00a7 1 et seq. of June 27, 1939, codified at 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5341.1-5341.21.\n. Section 761(a)(2) provides in relevant part: \u201cThe Commonwealth Court shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions or proceedings ... [by] the Commonwealth government, including any officer thereof, acting in his official capacity, except eminent domain proceedings.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(a)(2).\n. In light of our determination to exercise jurisdiction over the Reorganization Ordinance and decide that controversy now, petitioners' alternative request that we direct prompt consideration below is moot.\n. P.L. 1476, \u00a7 2 of Aug. 26, 1953, as amended by P.L. 795, \u00a7 1 of Aug. 13, 1963, codified at 53 P.S. \u00a7 13132(a)-(d).\n. Pursuant to the Reorganization Ordinance, the Board of Appeals would have seven members all appointed by the Mayor, with the advice and consent of a majority of City Council members, from among the nominees recommended to the Mayor by the Board of Property Assessment Appeals Nominating Panel (\"Panel\u201d). The Panel is also a newly-minted entity whose seven members are appointed, one each, by the Mayor, the City Council President, the Philadelphia Bar Association, the Building Industry Association of Philadelphia, the Housing Association of Delaware Valley, the Greater Philadelphia Association of Realtors, and the Southeast Chapter of the Assessors\u2019 Association of Pennsylvania. See Reorganization Ordinance \u00a7\u00a7 2-301(1), 2-302(3). Under this scheme, the common pleas judges play no role.\n. The City also objects to suit by petitioners in their official capacities on the ground that the action was not properly authorized at an open public meeting, pursuant to the Sunshine Act, 65 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 708. We need not reach this additional argument.\n. Moreover, the City is prohibited from exercising powers \u201ccontrary to, or in limitation or enlargement of, powers granted by acts of the General Assembly,\" which provide for the assessment of real or personal property. See 53 P.S. \u00a7 13133(a)(9). Section 13133(a)(9) governs the City\u2019s power to interfere with substantive rules governing valuation of property and not the City\u2019s authority to abolish its system of administering assessments, which authority is defined in Section 13132(c). See generally Board of Prop., Assessment v. County of Allegheny, 773 A.2d 816 (Pa.Cmwlth.2001) (discussing similar provisions related to property assessment in counties of second class).\n. Quoting McCormick, 564 A.2d at 910 n. 1, the City argues that \"what is said in debate, the remarks and understanding of individual legislators, is not relevant in ascertaining the meaning of a statute.\u201d The Statutory Construction Act, however, specifically authorizes consideration of legislative history when construction of a statute, beyond its plain language, is required. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c)(7). Notably, the observation in McCormick was not offered in the course of statutory construction following a finding of ambiguity, but instead, in the course of what appears to have been a plain language analysis. In that analysis, the Court merely rejected the appellants\u2019 reliance on \"the remarks of one member of the House of Representatives speaking in support of the Act [under review].\u201d McCormick, supra. Although lawmakers\u2019 statements during debate are generally not dispositive of legislative intent, especially where they serve to challenge the plain language of the statute as enacted, see, e.g., Martin v. Soblotney, 502 Pa. 418, 466 A.2d 1022, 1025 n. 5 (1983); Golden Triangle News, Inc. v. Corbett, 700 A.2d 1056, 1064 (Pa.Cmwlth.1997) (\u201clegislative history cannot act as a rationale for contradicting the plain meaning of the statute itself\u201d), legislative history \"is nonetheless instructive to our analysis and persuasive evidence ... [of] the General Assembly\u2019s intent.\u201d DeLellis, 660 A.2d at 31 n. 11; see Commonwealth v. Wilson, 529 Pa. 268, 602 A.2d 1290, 1294 n. 4 (1992) (floor debates not dispositive but informative); Boettger v. Loverro, 526 Pa. 510, 587 A.2d 712, 718 n. 16 (1991). Here, the legislative history is persuasive and serves to confirm our reading of the statute's language.\n. For the purposes of this action, only the BRT's appeal function is at issue.\n. Respecting the BRT's additional claim that the City\u2019s action was in violation of separation of powers principles, we note that, although the more common scenario involving separation of powers involves tension between an Act of the General Assembly or an action of the Commonwealth executive branch and the powers of the Judiciary, this Court has recognized that separation of powers tension may also arise in disputes involving county authorities and the local judiciary. See, e.g., Jefferson County Court Appointed Employees Ass\u2019n v. Pa. Labor Rels. Bd., 603 Pa. 482, 985 A.2d 697, 701 n. 3, 706 (2009) (county commissioners' board, acting in its legislative capacity, encroached on Judiciary's authority to hire, fire, and supervise its employees in directing Judiciary to eliminate five trial court employee positions). The tension implicated here, however, is further removed in that the judicial power implicated was delegated by the General Assembly to the local judiciary and is not inherently a judicial function. Indeed, the local judiciary retains a de novo appellate function following the completion of the assessment process. See 72 P.S. \u00a7 5020-518.1; 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 933(a)(2) (relating to appeals from local government agencies). Thus, the primary tension is not so much separation of powers as a tension between the local legislative action and the state legislative delegation of power. We offer these observations merely to provide context to the BRT\u2019s argument. We need not reach the merits of the separation of powers claim in light of our disposition premised upon the statute itself.\n. As noted supra, the only petitioners remaining in this suit are BRT members acting in their individual, not official, capacities.\n. Article III, Section 27 of our Constitution states that \"[n]o law shall extend the term of any public officer, or increase or diminish his salary or emoluments, after his election or appointment.\u201d In Buckwalter, we granted allocatur to \"determine whether [that Constitutional provision] prohibits mid-term compensation changes for elected municipal officers by means of a municipal ordinance.\u201d 985 A.2d at 730. We specifically decided that the term \"law\" in the constitutional provision included municipal ordinances. Id. at 733.\n. As we explained supra, only the request for extraordinary jurisdiction, not King's Bench jurisdiction, is proper here."}
