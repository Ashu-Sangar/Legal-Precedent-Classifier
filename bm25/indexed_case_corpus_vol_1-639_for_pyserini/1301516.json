{"id": "1301516", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Cohen,\nAlexander Hyram Clark and Marion Elizabeth Flood were found guilty of murder in the first degree and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal to this court appellants raise several grounds for a new trial which were rejected by the court below en banc.\nThe record of the proceedings below reflects a number of unusual incidents which, it is alleged, may have affected the propriety of the disposition of this prosecution. The jury in this case retired to deliberate at 5:37 p.m. after five days of testimony. At 2:00 a.m. the next morning a verdict of first degree murder with a recommendation of life imprisonment was returned and recorded against both appellants. Thereafter appellants\u2019 motion for a poll of the jury was allowed and it was discovered that Juror No. 9 was not in accord with his fellow jurors as to the guilt of either defendant. That juror stated that he found the defendants guilty only of robbery. Thereupon, over counsel\u2019s objection, the jury was sent back to the jury room for further deliberation. At 4:12 a.m. the jury returned and announced that they were \u201chopelessly deadlocked.\u201d A discussion ensued between the court and the jury during which Juror No. 12 posed a problem that had been confusing the jury. The jury, he said, had no trouble in finding a robbery, but could not reconcile this finding with a verdict of second degree murder (\u201cWe all agree there has been a robbery, but the murder business just doesn\u2019t come into it.\u201d). The court, in reply to this question, stated that a verdict of guilty in any degree \u201cwould stand on its own two feet.\u201d However, it is clear from a reading of the record that several members of the jury had developed an erroneous fixation on the absolute necessity of inclusion of robbery as a basic and integral component of the ultimate verdict. This is evidenced by: (1) Juror No. 9\u2019s disagreement with the initially recorded verdict; (2) Juror No. 12\u2019s inquiries at 4:12 a.m. The jury returned to the jury room at 4:17 a.m. and the final verdict was rendered at 5:25 a.m.\nUnder these circumstances the court, in all fairness to the defendants who were on trial for a capital offense, should have adjourned the jury\u2019s deliberations at 4:17 a.m. in order to have minimized the possibility of a verdict which was the product of impatience, fatigue and confusion.\nWe recognize that in Commonwealth v. Moore, 398 Pa. 198, 157 A. 2d 65 (1959), this court held, in a situation somewhat similar to the case at bar, that it was within a trial judge\u2019s discretion to direct a jury to deliberate through the night. In the Moore case, supra, however, we gave the widest latitude permissible to the court\u2019s discretion consistent with a defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial. We did not recommend the particular procedure used in that case and we certainly do not feel that an extension of our holding in Moore is warranted. To uphold the procedure followed in this case would be to greatly expand the permissive scope of a judge\u2019s discretion in such situations.\nThe Moore court in the small hours of the morning called the jury from its deliberations and offered them aid in the form of clarification of the issues involved in the case. The forelady of the Moore jury declined the court\u2019s offer of aid and stated that the jury was deadlocked. There was no indication whatsoever that confusion was responsible for the deadlock. On the other hand, in this case, the jury itself asked to be brought into the .courtroom for further instructions. There is little doubt that the atmosphere prevelant in the courtroom was one of utter confusion at 4:17 a.m. when the jury was returned to the jury room to find a unanimous verdict. It is also clear that the court did not seriously endeavor to dispel this disorder and confusion other than by terse and unilluminating advice. The trial court obviously abused its discretion when at 4:17 a.m. it ordered a confused and overworked jury to continue its deliberations.\nReversed and remanded for a new trial."}
