Because the finding of the arbitrator that Respondents failed to establish just cause for the suspension of the prison guards was rationally derived from the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement, it was entitled to deference under the \u201cEssence Test\u201d as reaffirmed by our Court most recently in Westmoreland Intermediate v. Westmoreland (PSEA), 595 Pa. 648, 939 A.2d 855 (2007). The order of the Commonwealth Court overturning the arbitrator\u2019s award is hereby REVERSED. See Office of the Attorney General v. Council 13, AFSCME, 577 Pa. 257, 844 A.2d 1217 (2004) (holding that where just cause is undefined by the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, in order to determine whether an employer had just cause to discipline an employee, an arbitrator may properly examine a variety of factors involving the nature of the existing employment relationship and the particular circumstances surrounding the disciplinary action taken).\nJustice SAYLOR files a Dissenting Statement joined by Justice EAKIN and Justice BAER."}
