{"id": "1084502", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nOn December 9, 1918, appellee was injured while in the course of his employment, by a premature explosion of dynamite. Following the accident, a compensation agreement was executed by the injured man and his employer, the appellant, which stated the nature of the injury to be, \u201cLeft eye, yision 1-15,\u201d adding, \u201cfor all practical use he has lost the sight of both eyes\u201d; and said, concerning the \u201cduration of incapacity,\u201d that it lasted \u201cfrom December 9, 1918, to August 24, 1926,\u201d totaling \u201c400 weeks\u201d of \u201cdisability,\u201d \u201cunder section 306 (a) and (c)\u201d of the act. After paying compensation for 125 weeks (the period specified by the act for the loss of one eye), appellant filed a petition with the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Board to terminate the agreement, on the ground that claimant\u2019s disability had ceased, in that he had recovered the \u201cuseful vision\u201d of his left eye, and had returned to work. The compensation authorities refused the prayer of the petition, the court below affirmed, and this appeal ensued.\nBroadly speaking, the record raises two fundamental questions: first, whether there is competent evidence to sustain the referee\u2019s findings of fact, and, second, if the findings are properly supported, whether the law was correctly applied to the facts.\nThe crux of the case appears in the sixth statement of fact thus: \u201cWe find the claimant has been at work, since June, 1919, as a miner, helping a contract miner; he does his work with the aid of glasses. He cannot do his work without the use of glasses; without their use he is blind for all practical purposes.\u201d This finding is amply sustained by evidence, given by both lay and expert medical witnesses, which accords with the facts as to claimant\u2019s sight stated in the compensation agreement, and shows that he is blind in the right eye and has, with the use of glasses, only 1-15 of normal vision in the left eye. The testimony of Dr. L. Webster Fox, an eminent oculist, shows claimant\u2019s impaired condition is permanent; that the claimant is totally blind in the right eye; that he has but 1-15 of normal vision in the left eye; that for all practical purposes 1-15 of normal vision constitutes the loss of an eye; that claimant\u2019s work is done largely by the sense of feeling, since he has no range of vision and no coordination. When asked as to claimant\u2019s capacity to labor, the witness said: \u201cPut a shovel in his hands, he could fill a car if it is in front of him, but his competing ability is nil, he couldn\u2019t stand up with another miner; he has lost his competing ability.\u201d\nThe Pennsylvania Compensation Law, section 306 (c), Act of 1915, P. L. 736, 713, provides: \u201cPermanent loss of the use of the hand, arm, foot, leg or eye shall be considered as the equivalent of the loss of such, band, arm, foot, leg or eye.\u201d Tbe fact that, through an operation and by tbe use of artificial means, such as glasses, a very small percentage of sight has been restored to one of claimant\u2019s eyes does not take bis case out of tbe class of \u201cpermanent loss of eye,\u201d as that phrase is used in tbe act.\nFillip v. Cramp, 80 Pa. Superior Ct. 68, relied on by appellant, is quite different in its facts from tbe case now before us. Moreover, tbe Superior Court there recognizes, and states: \u201cIf tbe sight is practically destroyed and only a little vision left, tbe act should afford compensation for this tbe same as if tbe sight were gone entirely.\u201d\nTbe judgment is affirmed."}
