{"id": "1708078", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nAppellants, T. P. McGovern and Dorothy McGovern, husband and wife, filed a complaint in equity on February 5, 1971, against their next door neighbors John J. Spear and Constance Spear. Appellants sought to enjoin appellees (1) from maintaining a wooden fence upon appellants\u2019 property, (2) from maintaining a large and bright spotlight which interfered with the appellants\u2019 use of their property; and (3) from burning various combustible materials which interfered with the appellants\u2019 use of their property. Appellants further alleged that they had suffered damages as a result of the complained of conduct of appellees. Appellees\u2019 preliminary objections were dismissed, and they filed an answer to the complaint. Subsequently, a pretrial conference was held, depositions of appellant T. P. McGovern and appellee John J. Spear were taken, and a motion for summary judgment was filed by appellees. Summary judgment for the appellees was entered on September 10, 1973. This appeal followed. Appellants now contend that the entry of summary judgment was improper because the pleadings and depositions presented genuine issues of fact.\nAppellants\u2019 complaint contained three counts, each relating to separate and unrelated transactions. Count One of the complaint concerned appellees\u2019 construction and maintenance of a wooden fence upon appellants\u2019 property. Count Two concerned appellees\u2019 large and bright spotlight which allegedly interfered with appellants\u2019 use of their property. The record discloses that subsequent to the filing of the complaint the appellees ceased the conduct complained of in Counts One and Two. The fence, which admittedly encroached four or five inches upon appellants\u2019 property, was taken down, and appellees stopped using the spotlight. Under these circumstances, the trial court could have properly decided to exercise its discretion and deny injunctive relief, but the granting of summary judgment on these two counts was error. In addition to their request for injunctive relief, appellants alleged (1) that they had suffered harm as a result of the fence encroachment and appellees\u2019 refusals to remove the fence prior to the commencement of the law suit; and (2) that they had suffered harm as a result of the appellees\u2019 maintenance of the spotlight prior to its removal following commencement of the law suit. The pleadings and depositions disclose that genuine issues of fact concerning appellants\u2019 alleged damages remained in dispute. The trial court\u2019s opinion is silent concerning these alleged damages.\nThere was proper equity jurisdiction as to Counts One and Two because at the time the action was initiated, the alleged fence and spotlight encroachments were continuing. Once equity obtains jurisdiction, that jurisdiction continues until all issues raised have been determined. Solomon v. Cedar Acres East, Inc., 455 Pa. 496, 317 A.2d 283 (1974); Ackerman v. North Huntingdon, 437 Pa. 49, 261 A.2d 570 (1970); Wortex Mills v. Textile Workers Union, 380 Pa. 3, 109 A.2d 815 (1955). The trial court erred in not resolving the issue of damages raised by the pleading. Counts One and Two therefore must be remanded for a resolution of the damage question.\nCount Three concerned appellees\u2019 burning of combustible materials. In this Count, as in Counts One and Two, appellants requested injunctive relief and requested damages for harm allegedly suffered. The record discloses, however, that the activity complained of in Count Three ceased in May of 1970, seven months before the filing of appellants\u2019 complaint. Under these circumstances, no basis for equity jurisdiction existed at the time the complaint was filed. Appellants, however, have a remedy at law for the harm allegedly suffered, and rather than entering summary judgment, the trial court should have certified appellants\u2019 claim for damages to the law side of the court pursuant to Rule 1509 (c) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Civil Procedure.\nThe decree of the trial court is vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings Consistent with this opinion.\nEach party to pay own costs.\nJONES, C. J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case."}
