{"id": "483742", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nAppellants, Franklin Duane Crawford and Nancy Elaine Young, were tried by a judge and jury and found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the death of Thomas Young, Jr., age two and one-half years, the son of Thomas Young, Sr. and appellant Nancy Elaine Young. Appellants\u2019 post-trial motions were denied, and they were sentenced. These appeals followed.\nAppellants first argue that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was insufficient to establish the corpus delicti of the crime of voluntary manslaughter. We do not agree. The Commonwealth\u2019s pathologist, Dr. Miller, who performed the autopsy on the victim, testified that the infant\u2019s death was caused by a severe fracture of the skull and. internal hemorrhaging. Dr. Miller further testified that, in his opinion, the skull fracture was caused by a blunt instrument. On cross-examination, the doctor was asked if the injury could have been caused by the child's being hit with an automobile bumper. He answered it was possible, but that if an automobile had struck the child, there would have been areas of trauma other than the single area of the victim\u2019s skull. He further testified that, because of the pressure needed to cause such a fracture as was found in the victim\u2019s skull, it was not likely that the victim had fallen or struck his head on a stone or other hard substance. Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s witness testified that there was a search of the area in which the infant\u2019s body was found and there were no objects discovered that would be the type to cause the fracture, even if the infant had fallen from the top of an enbankment near where the body was found. This proof was necessary to eliminate the pathologist\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that if the child had fallen on a hard object, from a sufficient height, the fracture could have resulted. Finally, the child\u2019s body was found some six-tenths of a mile from his home, which by the shortest route, would have required the two and one-half year old infant to cross two bridges.\nUnder these facts, we are of the opinion that the Commonwealth, by means of circumstantial evidence, has established that the infant died as a result of criminal means. In Commonwealth v. May, 451 Pa. 31, 301 A.2d 368 (1973), we stated:\n\u201cIt has long been the law of this Commonwealth that the prosecution has no duty to affirmatively exclude the possibility of accident or suicide in order to establish the corpus delicti. Commonwealth v. Ross, 403 Pa. 358, 169 A.2d 780 (1961); Commonwealth v. Bishop, 285 Pa. 49, 131 A. 657 (1926); Commonwealth v. Puglise, 276 Pa. 235, 120 A. 401 (1923). Such a requirement would, in effect, require the Commonwealth to exclude every possibility of doubt that death was caused by criminal agency.\n\u201cIn Commonwealth v. Boykin, 450 Pa. 25, 298 A.2d 258 (1972) . . ., the court held that the Commonwealth was merely required to establish that the death was consistent with a criminal agency.\u201d\nIn the instant case, the jury was presented with evidence that would support a finding that the infant\u2019s death was caused by human intervention. The type of fracture on the infant\u2019s head, the unlikeliness that it was caused by an automobile or a fall, and the location of the body support a finding that human intervention caused the infant\u2019s death. See Commonwealth v. Johnson, 162 Pa. 63, 29 A. 280 (1894).\nAppellants next argue that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence failed to prove their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. We do not agree. Viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the following facts support appellants\u2019 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. On the night the infant disappeared, appellants picked up the infant from a babysitter at about 2 a.m. (July 29, 1973). They subsequently drove the babysitter to Kit-tanning, Pennsylvania, and proceeded to their home, arriving at approximately 3 a.m. At 8:50 a.m., the same morning, appellants called the state police and reported the child missing. Both appellants fixed the time the child was discovered missing as 3:30 a.m. on the morning of July 29, 1973. Appellants testified that immediately before the child disappeared, they heard a car rapidly drive away from the area of their residence. At trial, the Commonwealth produced witnesses who saw appellant Crawford at about 2:30 a.m. on July 29, 1973 in the exact area where the infant was found. In addition, neighbors of appellants testified that at or about 3:00 a. m. on the night of the infant\u2019s disappearance, they heard appellant Crawford return to his residence and say to appellant Young that he had been seen, to which she replied \u201cOh no, Oh no.\u201d In addition the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence establishes that appellants had the exclusive control of the infant from the time it was last seen alive, until its body was found by police. Under these facts, we are convinced that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, while circumstantial, was sufficient to prove appellants\u2019 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See Commonwealth v. Paquette, 451 Pa. 250, 301 A.2d 837 (1973), Commonwealth v. Boykin, 450 Pa. 25, 298 A.2d 258 (1972).\nAppellants next argue that the court erred in refusing to order the pretrial discovery of certain oral statements made by appellants to the police and recorded by the police in notes. A hearing was held on this motion and the judge denied appellants\u2019 motion, stating that there were no such written statements. Appellants contend that while there were formal statements, the police had written notes they kept during the questioning of appellants and they were entitled to these and certain reports. We do not agree. In our opinion, this case is controlled by our decision in Commonwealth v. Turra, 442 Pa. 192, 196, 275 A.2d 96, 98 (1971), where we stated:\n\u201c. . . Rule 310 specifically proscribes pretrial disclosure and inspection of other evidence in the possession of the Commonwealth, including oral admissions such as here involved, unless the defendant can show the existence of exceptional circumstances and compelling reasons why such should be permitted.\u201d\nIn the instant case, appellants were not entitled to the items they sought discovery of and proved no exceptional circumstances that would compel their discovery. See Com. ex rel. Specter v. Shiomos, 457 Pa. 104, 320 A.2d 134 (1974).\nAppellants raise other allegations of error which we need not discuss since they failed to note a proper objection. See Commonwealth v. Clair,-Pa.-, 326 A.2d 272 (1974).\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.\nEAGEN, J., concurs in the result.\nROBERTS, J., files a concurring opinion.\nMANDER1NO, J., dissents.\n. Appellants were tried together and raise the same allegations of error in these appeals; therefore, we will treat the appeals in a single opinion."}
