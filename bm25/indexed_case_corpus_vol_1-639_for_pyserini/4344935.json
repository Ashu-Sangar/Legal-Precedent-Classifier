See Pa.R.A.P. 905(a) (\u201cUpon receipt of the notice of appeal the clerk shall immediately stamp it with the date of receipt, and that date shall be shown on the docket.\u201d); Pa.R.A.P. 905(b) (\u201cThe clerk shall immediately transmit to the prothonotary of the appellate court ... a copy of the notice of appeal showing the date of receipt[.]\u201d). Pursuant to our general supervisory and administrative authority over all of the lower courts, we direct the Court of Common Pleas to ensure the clerk of court abides by our explicit rules of appellate procedure, as set forth in Pennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 905, supra, as it pertains to Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal from his judgment of sentence. See Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 10; In re Administrative Order No. l-MD-2003, 594 Pa. 346, 936 A.2d 1 (2007) (holding clerk of courts, similar to prothonotaries, are clerks of the court of common pleas with no judicial power); Payne v. Commonwealth Dept. of Corrections, 582 Pa. 375, 384, 871 A.2d 795, 801 (2005) (\u201cThis Court\u2019s power to establish rules of procedure for state courts is exclusive.\u201d) (citing Commonwealth v. Morris, 565 Pa. 1, 771 A.2d 721 (2001)); Commonwealth v. Morgan, 469 Pa. 35, 364 A.2d 891, 892 n. 2 (1976) (trial courts have a \u201cresponsibility to supervise their personnel and to assure that those persons under their charge responsibly and expeditiously perform their assigned tasks\u201d).\nThereafter, a determination of timeliness regarding Appellant\u2019s direct appeal from his judgment of sentence, and whether a remand for an evidentiary hearing is warranted with regard thereto, may be made by the courts below. See Commonwealth v. Jones, 549 Pa. 58, 700 A.2d 423 (1997) (explaining prisoner mailbox rule and indicating a remand for an evidentiary hearing may be warranted where timeliness is at issue).\nAccordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that the Superior Court\u2019s decision which is before us for review is hereby VACATED and the case is REMANDED to the Lackawanna County Court of Common Pleas for further proceedings. Jurisdiction is relinquished.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting statement in which Chief Justice CASTILLE and Justice TODD join.\n.
