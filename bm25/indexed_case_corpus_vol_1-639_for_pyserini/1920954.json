{"id": "1920954", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nMartin Krepinevich (decedent), a Butler County resident, died intestate as the result of an automobile accident which occurred on October 6, 1962. An auditor was appointed by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Butler County to determine the heirs of the decedent and to recommend the manner of distribution of his estate.\nThere were two claimants to the estate: (1) TJstina Mitrofanovna Krepinevich (appellant), claiming as widow of the decedent and as his sole heir on the basis that he was survived by \u201cno issue, parent, brother, sister, child of a brother or sister, grandparent, uncle or aunt\u201d as provided by \u00a72(4) of the Intestate Act of 1947, P. L. 80, as amended, 20 P.S. \u00a71.2(4); (2) The Commonwealth claiming under \u00a71314 of The Fiscal Code of 1929, P. L. 343, 72 P.S. \u00a71314 in the event that the evidence failed to establish that the appellant is the widow of the decedent.\nThe auditor held that the appellant had failed to prove that she was the widow of the decedent and recommended that the funds of the estate be awarded to the Commonwealth without escheat. The Orphans\u2019 Court of Butler County adopted the auditor\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and awarded the estate to the Commonwealth.\nThe standard the appellant must satisfy in order to substantiate her claim as a widow was enunciated by this Court in Link\u2019s Estate (No. 1), 319 Pa. 513, 522, 523, 180 Atl. 1 (1935) : \u201cThe evidence to sustain relationship must bear on every material feature necessary to support a finding of kinship. It must be grounded on a reasonable certainty and come from witnesses whose truth and candor are not questioned. To defeat the claim of the Commonwealth the evidence must be so clear, precise and definite in quality and quantity as to satisfy the court below that the relationship claimed existed.\u201d See also: Davis Estate, 365 Pa. 605, 608, 76 A. 2d 643 (1950); Schultz Estate, 32 Pa. D. & C. 2d 312, 321 (1963); Stevens Estate, 28 Pa. D. & C. 2d 658, 662 (1962); Martinzik Estate, 25 Pa. D. & C. 2d 701, 707 (1962). Specifically, appellant must prove (1) that she is the decedent\u2019s widow and (2) that the decedent was not survived by any issue, parent, brother, sister, child of a brother or sister, grandparent, uncle or aunt. See: Bokey Estate, 412 Pa. 244, 250, 194 A. 2d 194 (1963).\nWe start with the understanding that findings of fact by an auditor when approved by the Orphans\u2019 Court are entitled to as much weight as the verdict of a jury and will not be set aside except for manifest error. See: Istocin\u2019s Estate, 126 Pa. Superior Ct. 158, 161, 190 Atl. 382 (1937). We believe, however, that the auditor has committed manifest error in this case.\nAppellant\u2019s evidence consisted primarily of the testimony of persons who knew personally either the decedent or the appellant or both. Mrs. Sadie Lagodich, appellant\u2019s first cousin and a native of the Soviet Union, was examined by deposition in Hartford, Connecticut. She testified that she personally knew appellant, that she knew that appellant had married the decedent and that she knew where they lived after the marriage. She could not remember when they were married; she was not actually present at the marriage ceremony. She remembered that the couple had three or four children. Mrs. Lagodich returned to Russia for a visit in 1929, and at that time she talked with appellant. In the course of her visit she was informed that all the children of appellant and decedent had died during World War I. Appellant spoke of her husband and the fact that she was now living alone. She asked Mrs. Lagodich to contact her husband when she returned to the United States. Mrs. Lagodich has not seen nor heard from the decedent since 1915 in Springfield, Massachusetts.\nMrs. Lagodich testified that she corresponds regularly with her niece in Russia who often mentions the appellant and relays messages for her since appellant is illiterate. Mrs. Lagodich recently sent some items to the appellant and the niece wrote back that appellant had received the items. A recent letter from the niece indicated that appellant was aware that her husband had been killed.\nThe auditor found that Mrs. Lagodich\u2019s testimony was \u201cconfused and uncertain.\u201d On the contrary, we find that her testimony is remarkably consistent. Mrs. Lagodich, who was 70 years old when she testified, was questioned about events which transpired 50 years ago. It is not surprising that she has forgotten some details. She remembers clearly the facts which are important for the resolution of this case. The fact that she cannot remember when the couple was married and that she did not attend the wedding are of little consequence. What is important is that she knew both appellant and the decedent and knew that they were, in fact, married. It is important to note that the auditor did not question the credibility of Mrs. Lagodich but merely the probative weight of her testimony. While the auditor must determine the credibility of the witnesses (Dettra Will, 415 Pa. 197, 202, 202 A. 2d 827 (1964); Patterson\u2019s Estate, 237 Pa. 24, 27, 85 Atl. 75 (1912)), an appellate court is certainly in as good a position as the auditor to judge the probative weight of evidence given by deposition.\nTheodore Krepinevieh, executor of the estate, testified that he had known the decedent since 1906, that he had come to the United States in 1912 and that decedent had come in 1913. He was aware of the marriage of the decedent, but it is not clear whether he actually knew the appellant. Mr. Krepinevieh testified that decedent had only one child who died during the War. When asked about Mrs. Lagodich\u2019s testimony, Mr. Krepinevieh testified that decedent had told Mm that his wife had remarried and had other children by her second and third husbands.\nThe auditor places much weight on this inconsistency between the testimony of Mrs. Lagodich and Mr. Krepinevich. The apparent inconsistency is of no consequence, however. Both parties testified that decedent married the appellant and that there are no surviving children of the marriage. Mr. Krepinevich did not testify that decedent and the appellant were divorced. \u201cUpon proof of a valid marriage, the law presumes that such marriage continues until the death of one of the parties (actual or presumptive after seven years) or a divorce is proven.\u201d Watt Estate, 409 Pa. 44, 51, 185 A. 2d 781 (1962). Both parties have testified to the fact of the marriage, and Mrs. Lagodich has testified that the appellant survived her husband. Therefore, absent proof of a divorce, there is a presumption that the appellant was still married to her husband at the time of his death. There is no evidence whatsoever in the record that there was a divorce.\nMichael Mamula, decedent\u2019s attorney, testified that he knew of decedent\u2019s wife, that decedent regularly sent her money, that the address given as appellant\u2019s address in Russia corresponded with the address to which the money was sent. Mr. Mamula further testified that the decedent had discussed with him leaving his estate to his wife in Russia but that he was concerned that the estate would be confiscated.\nLetters rogatory were also issued to examine the appellant in the Soviet Union; the Commonwealth was given the opportunity to file interrogatories. Appellant testified that she married the decedent in 1904, that they had four children, two of whom died before decedent left Russia in 1912 and two of whom died after he left Russia. She stated that she corresponded regularly with her husband until 1960, and the address she gave corresponded with the decedent\u2019s address at the time of his death. She testified that they were never divorced, that she knew Sadie Lagodich, that she corresponds with her regularly, and the address she gave corresponded with Mrs. Lagodich\u2019s present address.\nA power of attorney was issued to the law firm of Wolf, Popper, Eoss, Wolf and Jones in New York, which appellant signed with three crosses. The accompanying notation of the witness indicates that appellant is illiterate, which squares with the testimony of Mrs. Lagodich to the effect that Mrs. Krepinevich could neither read nor write. While we have held that powers of attorney prove nothing more than that the person signing the document claimed to be the person whose name he signed unless there is additional corroborative evidence (Slotkin Estate, 40 Pa. D. & C. 2d 334, 339 (1965), aff\u2019d. per curiam, 423 Pa. 628, 222 A. 2d 597 (1966); Malika Estate, 31 Pa. D. & C. 2d 736, 739 (1963)), yet we believe that the evidence outlined above does corroborate the signature on the power of attorney.\nWe hold that the evidence recited above indicates that decedent married Ustina Mitrofanovna Krepinevich, that the couple was never divorced and that Mrs. Krepinevich survived her husband. Therefore, appellant has proved that she is the widow and heir of the decedent. Watt Estate, 409 Pa. 44, 51, 185 A. 2d 781 (1962).\nAppellant has proved that no children survived the decedent. She has not, however, proved that no parent, brother, sister, child of a brother or sister, grandparent, uncle or aunt survived the decedent, and, since she has failed to prove this, she can only qualify under Section 2(3) of the Intestate Act. We believe that justice requires that we remand this case to the Orphans\u2019 Court below to enable the appellant to bring forth evidence, if she can, indicating that none of the persons listed above is now living. Since we are remanding the case, we will also offer the Commonwealth an opportunity to prove that the appellant will not have the actual \u201cbenefit, use, enjoyment or control of the money or other property\u201d as required by Pennsylvania\u2019s Iron Curtain Act of 1953. Under this act, should the court below decide that appellant will not have the use of the money, it can award the money to the Commonwealth without escheat. If the Commonwealth decides to raise this issue on remand, it should be prepared to argue the constitutionality of the Iron Curtain Act in light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U.S. 429 (1968).\nDecree vacated and matter remanded to the court below for proceedings consistent with the views expressed in this opinion. Estate pays costs.\nMr. Justice Musmanno did not participate in the decision of this case.\n\u201cThe surviving spouse shall be entitled to the following share or shares: ... (4) No issue or other designated person. All of the estate if the decedent is survived by no issue, parent, brother, sister, child of a brother or sister, grandparent, uncle or aunt.\u201d\n\u201cIn any such case of unawarded moneys, or of moneys awarded to claimants the whereabouts whereof or that of their legal representatives the fiduciary has been unable to ascertain, the court having jurisdiction of his accounts may, upon motion, or on its own initiative, in its discretion, order the payment of such moneys into the State Treasury, . . .\u201d\n\u201cTile surviving spouse shall be entitled to the following share or shares'. . . . (S) No issue. The first ten thousand dollars in value and one-half of the balance of the estate, if the decedent is survived by no issue; . . .\u201d\n\u201cWhenever it shall appear to the court that if distribution were made a beneficiary would not have the actual benefit, use, enjoyment or control of the money or other property distributed to him by a fiduciary, the court shall have the power and authority to direct the fiduciary (a) to make payment of the share of such beneficiary at such times and in such manner and amounts as the court may deem proper, or (b) to withhold distribution of the share of such beneficiary, convert it to cash, and pay it through the Department of Revenue into the State Treasury without es-cheat.\u201d P. L. 674, \u00a72, 20 P.S. \u00a71156.\nThe Philadelphia Orphans\u2019 Court has recently held that the Iron Curtain Act is unconstitutional. See: Struchmanczuk Estate, 44 Pa. D. & C. 2d 155 (1968)."}
