{"id": "1922675", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nCatherine I. Noonan was a passenger in an automobile operated by her son, Patrick Noonan, when it collided with an automobile operated by Manuel McHugh. Alleging that the collision was caused by McHugh\u2019s negligent driving, Catherine I. Noonan instituted this action against him to recover compensation for injuries suffered. McHugh joined Patrick Noonan as an additional defendant in the action, alleging that his negligence caused the collision, and that he \u201cis alone liable or jointly and severally liable . . . for the cause of action asserted by Catherine I. Noonan.\u201d Patrick Noonan filed an answer to the complaint of the original defendant in which he asserted under \u201cNew Matter\u201d that in consideration. of the payment of $2000, the plaintiff, Catherine I. Noonan, had released him from any and all claims arising out of the accident. The plaintiff did not reply to this answer because no notice to plead was endorsed on it. See, Pa. R. C. P. 1026.\nAt trial, the evidence disclosed that the collision occurred at the intersection of West River Street and West Ross Street in the City of Wilkes-Barre, and that the intersection is controlled by a traffic light. According to testimony introduced by the plaintiff, the Noonan automobile was proceeding north on West River Street and was in the intersection with the green light in favor of traffic traveling on West River Street, when it was hit by the McHugh automobile which was traveling in a westerly direction on West Ross Street. According to testimony introduced by the defendant McHugh, his automobile was more than half way through the intersection with the traffic light green and in favor of traffic traveling on West Ross Street, when it was hit by the Noonan automobile.\nThe trial judge instructed the jury, inter alia, that one of four verdicts was possible under the evidence: (1) If the jury concluded that neither operator of the automobiles involved was negligent, then the verdict should be against the plaintiff and in favor of both defendants; (2) If the jury concluded that the operators of both automobiles were negligent and that such negligence was the proximate cause of the accident, then the verdict should be in favor of the plaintiff and against both defendants, namely, McHugh and Patrick Noonan; (3) If the jury concluded that McHugh alone was negligent and that his negligence was the proximate cause of the accident, then the verdict should be in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant McHugh only; and (4) If the jury concluded that Patrick Noonan was alone negligent and that his negligence was the proximate cause of the accident, then the verdict should be in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant Noonan only. A general exception to the charge was noted of record by counsel for both Catherine I. Noonan and Manuel McHugh.\nThree separate verdict slips were sent out with the jury. Each slip was captioned differently, namely: (1) \u201cCatherine I. Noonan v. Patrick Noonan\u201d; (2) Catherine I. Noonan v. Manuel McHugh\u201d; and (3) \u201cCatherine I. Noonan v. Manuel McHugh (defendant) and Patrick Noonan (additional defendant).\u201d Each slip had printed on it, \u201cWe the jury in the above case, find a verdict in favor of . . . Foreman.\u201d\nAt the conclusion of its deliberations, the jury returned to the courtroom and delivered to the trial judge the three verdict slips. On slip No. 1, captioned \u201cCatherine I. Noonan v. Patrick Noonan,\u201d there was written in longhand after the printed words \u201cfind a verdict in favor of\u201d the following: \u201cCatherine I. Noonan for |10,000. William Parry, Foreman.\u201d Jury slips Nos. 2 and 3, supra, were in blank with no writing on them at all. The court did not mold the verdict, nor was it requested to do so. A verdict was recorded in favor of Catherine I. Noonan v. Patrick Noonan in the amount of $10,000. No objection was entered by counsel. Subsequently, Catherine I. Noonan filed a motion for a new trial which was denied. Without the entry of any judgment, she filed this appeal. Patrick Noonan did not appeal.\nOn the present state of the record, we decline to entertain the appeal. With respect to the verdict entered in favor of Catherine I. Noonan against Patrick Noonan, no judgment has been entered. An appeal lies only after a judgment has been entered. Bartkewich v. Billinger, 430 Pa. 207, 241 A. 2d 916 (1968), and Straw v. Sands, 426 Pa. 81, 231 A. 2d 144 (1987). A like situation prevails with respect to the claim of Catherine I. Noonan v. McHugh. A judgment has not been entered in this case because no specific verdict of the jury was entered in connection with the case against McHugh. As to this particular claim, we will, therefore, remand the record to give the court below the opportunity of considering the propriety of molding the jury\u2019s verdict. See Wadatz v. Taormina, 356 Pa. 481, 52 A. 2d 220 (1947), and Maize v. Atlantic Refining Co., 352 Pa. 51, 41 A. 2d 850 (1945).\nAppeal dismissed and record remanded.\nMr. Justice Roberts took no part in the consideration or decision of this case."}
