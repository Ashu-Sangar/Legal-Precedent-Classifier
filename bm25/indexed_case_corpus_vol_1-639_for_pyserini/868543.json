{"id": "868543", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis proceeding for the erection of a county bridge over the Youghiogheny river, between the boroughs of Connellsville and New Haven, appears to be under the act of June 18, 1886, P. L. 560, the thirty-fifth section of which provides, among other things, that \u201c if, on the report of viewers, it shall appear to the court, grand jury and commissioners of the county that such bridge is necessary and would be too expensive for such township or townships, it shall be entered on record as a county bridge.\u201d In the decree of court finding \u201c that said bridge is necessary and would be too expensive for said boroughs of Connellsville and New Haven,\u201d and approving \u201c the report of the viewers and finding of the grand jury,\u201d it is accordingly \u201c ordered that the same be referred to the commissioners .... for such action as they may deem expedient and proper in accordance with law; and, if approved by them, that the same be recorded as a county bridge.\u201d This decree is at best only provisional. It is neither effective nor final unless the county commissioners concur in the findings of the court and the grand jury. If they refuse to concur, without more, the proceeding falls. It they elect to exercise the authority vested in them by the first section of the act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 267, and merely assist in building the bridge, a different result is accomplished. It does not appear in this case, nor is it even alleged that the commissioners have taken any action in the premises. If they have not, this appeal is clearly premature ; and, acting on that assumption, we think the appeal should be quashed.\nAppeal quashed."}
