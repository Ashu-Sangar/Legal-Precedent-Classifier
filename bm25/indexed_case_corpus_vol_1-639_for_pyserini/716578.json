{"id": "716578", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nOn October 6, 1999, 14-year-old IB was walking home from school when appellant pulled up beside her in his black Lexus, asked her if he knew her, and then told her to get in the car. She refused, went home, and told her grandmother of the incident. IB described appellant as a black male wearing a black baseball cap, blue hooded sweatshirt, and sunglasses. IB saw appellant driving the same car later that day, and again the next day. On October 18, 1999, IB picked out appellant\u2019s photograph at the police station; she later identified him at trial. Appellant was convicted of luring a child into a motor vehicle, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2910, which provides:\nA person who lures a child into a motor vehicle without the consent, express or implied, of the child\u2019s parent or guardian, unless the circumstances reasonably indicate that the child is in need of assistance, commits a misdemeanor of the first degree.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2910.\nAppellant argues that as the evidence shows the child did not get into the vehicle, the section with which he was charged was not violated. He contends \u00a7 2910 cannot be interpreted to include the inchoate offense of attempt to lure a child into a vehicle. Based on a line of its own cases, the Superior Court- determined that attempted luring is included within \u00a7 2910. The Superior Court noted all of the cases interpreting \u00a7 2910 involved the attempted luring of a child into a motor vehicle. Commonwealth v. Tate, 789 A.2d 229, 231 (Pa.Super.2002). The court reasoned its prior decisions indicated that luring a child could be viewed as an inchoate offense intended to deter the completed offenses of kidnapping, unlawful restraint, assault, or sexual offenses. Id. Thus, the Superior Court opined, \u201cthe statutory usage of the phrase luring a child \u2018into\u2019 a motor vehicle may be understood to recite the prohibited object of the crime rather than describe an element of the crime.\u201d Id. The court also relied on a subcommittee note for support. See Pa. Standard Jury Instruction 15.2910 (sponsor\u2019s aim: to make luring a crime where kidnapping not completed). The Superior Court concluded \u00a7 2910 is an absolute prohibition to inviting unknown children into vehicles. Tate, at 231.\nWe cannot agree with this interpretation of the language of \u00a7 2910, no matter how desirable that result may be. Appellant did not lure IB into a car. He may have tried to do so, but he was unsuccessful. Unsuccessful attempts at criminality may still be punished, but the offense is criminal attempt, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 901. Appellant was not charged with attempt, for reasons beyond the record. Statutes that make an attempt to accomplish something sufficient to complete the crime say so explicitly. See, e.g., simple assault, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2701, aggravated assault, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702; and robbery, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701(2). The definition of this offense does not do so.\nCourts must look to the plain meaning of the words in a statute. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1901, 1903; see also Commonwealth v. Booth, 564 Pa. 228, 766 A.2d 843 (2001) (citation omitted). Penal statutes are to be strictly construed. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1928(b)(1). If the legislature intended to make offering a ride to a child a crime, it could easily have drafted the statute accordingly; instead, the plain words of the offense require proof that the child was lured into the vehicle, not that an effort to do so was made. If the legislature wishes the invitation to be sufficient, it must say so. If the Commonwealth wishes to prosecute the invitation, it must charge criminal attempt. It is not a court\u2019s place to imbue the statute with a meaning other than that dictated by the plain and unambiguous language of the statute. See 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1921(a), (b). \u201c[A] court may not achieve an acceptable construction of a penal statute by reading into the statute terms that broaden its scope.\u201d Booth, at 846.\nThe plain meaning of the statute does not include the inchoate offense of attempting to lure a child into a motor vehicle. Therefore, we are constrained to vacate the judgment of sentence.\nThe Superior Court\u2019s order is reversed; the judgment of sentence is vacated.\nFormer Chief Justice ZAPPALA did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n.
