{"id": "1206883", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nOn December 5, 1940, a jury adjudged William J. Earnest, aged 35 years, guilty of murder in the first degree and fixed the penalty at death. Sentence was imposed on April 17, 1941, and this appeal followed. The victim named in the indictment was Mrs. Ethel Atkins, aged 34 years, whose nude, bloody and brutally battered body was found on the stairway of an unoccupied home in Montgomery County on the afternoon of September 24, 1940.\nThe appellant was a chef in Philadelphia. His usual hours of work were from 8 p. m. to 8 a. m. On September 23, 1940, he had a \u201cnight off\u201d. At about 7 p. m. that day he left the house where he lived with a woman not his wife and with an adopted child, aged 9 years, and spent the entire night visiting various tap-rooms and \u201cclubs\u201d, at all of which he drank copiously of beer and less copiously of whiskey. Between 2 and 3 a. m. he met at one of these places a casual acquaintance named Richard Brady. About 3 a. m. they offered to escort to her home a female employee of the tap-room they were then leaving. The invitation was accepted and on the way to the woman\u2019s home, all three visited four clubs, at all of which they drank beer and at one of which the appellant drank whiskey. They then went to another club where they were joined by Mrs. Atkins. All four remained at this club until 8 a. m. and then went to a diner where they drank coffee or tomato juice and the first woman was then \u201cleft out\u201d in front of her home. Mrs. Atkins was then \u201ctaken for a ride\u201d, she readily consenting. Appellant drove the car. Their common quest was for a \u201cquiet spot\u201d in Montgomery County. On Dreshertown Road a vacant house, with which appellant admitted he was \u201cfamiliar\u201d, was noticed. After driving past the house, the appellant \u201cbacked up and drove in\u201d. Finding the doors locked, appellant broke a window, entered the house and admitted Brady and Mrs. Atkins by the kitchen door. Mrs. Atkins said she \u201cdid not want Brady to watch\u201d and appellant asked Brady to stay out. Appellant and Mrs. Atkins first occupied a couch in the kitchen and he made a proposal to her which she rej\u00e9cted, saying \u201cshe was out all night and wanted to go to bed.\u201d She next \u201ctook off her dress and slip\u201d and declared that she \u201cdid not want to do anything until she had a bed. She asked about the upstairs and he said he would see.\u201d As they were going through the house they noticed Brady \u201clooking in the window\u201d. Mrs. Atkins said: \u201cLook at Peeping Tom.\u201d She and appellant then went upstairs, where there was only a dismantled bed \u201cagainst the wall\u201d. According to appellant, Mrs. Atkins then lay on the floor, they accomplished their purpose and she then informed him that she had a venereal disease and quickly thereafter grabbed him in such a way as to cause him such pain that he fainted. He added: \u201cWhen I came to she was standing there with a stick\u201d and \u201cshe brought the stick around three times and the third time I got it and she reached down again and grabbed him again\u201d as she had done previously. He continued: \u201cI hit her with the stick and she fell up against the bed post, then she was up right away and she was flying at me like a wild woman. I hit her; I hit her a lot but I did not mean to kill her.\u201d He admitted that he \u201chit her with the stick, on the head, on the head, on the head, all the time.\u201d He added: \u201cI remember having the bed in my hand and I hit her twice with that and I fell, and when I fell the bed was on top of her and I picked it up. I went out. I seen what I had done. I did not mean to kill her.\u201d Appellant would not admit inflicting the injuries Mrs. Atkins suffered in the abdominal and genital regions of her body. The autopsy disclosed multiple wounds. As the coroner\u2019s physician described the wounds, \u201cthere was a large laceration of the scalp down to the bone. It left a dented area six by two inches in diameter. There were three deep lacerations upon the face just to the left of the outer comer of the left eye. These extended down to the bone. The left side of the lower lip was torn away by an irregular gash that covered an area two inches in diameter. This extended down to the lower jaw bone and exposed two teeth. Several teeth had their cutting edges broken. . . . There was a narrow semi-circular laceration five and a half inches long just above the right breast.\u201d The physician then described the lacerations in the genital region evidently inflicted with an inserted club and which injuries \u201cwould have caused death eventually\u201d. The cause of death was \u201chemorrhage from multiple lacerations of the head and body and some hemorrhages from these wounds.\u201d The victim\u2019s body was drained of practically all its blood. The chief county detective who entered in the afternoon the room where Mrs. Atkins was killed in the morning found \u201ca large pool of blood three feet seven inches in length and one foot wide. The entire area was smeared up and there were thick clots of blood and pieces of hair matted in the blood.\u201d He also found a bloody club, thirty-one inches in length and one and one-quarter inches in diameter. There were \u201ca number of hairs caught in the rough edges of the club and also the crack\u201d. There was also \u201ca broken end of a stick, bloody and split\u201d. He said he \u201capproximated the ends of this club\u201d with the one already described.\nRichard Brady testified that when Earnest came downstairs (after killing Mrs. Atkins) \u201che had a cut on his hand and there was some blood there and some blood on his shirt collar and on the side.\u201d Earnest would not let Brady go up-stairs. The only sounds Brady admitted hearing as he sat outside in the car was \u201cthe shuffling of feet\u201d. Brady when asked if Earnest was intoxicated at the time they left the first woman in the morning and started \u201cto the farm\u201d (where the killing took place) answered: \u201cHe did not seem to be.\u201d\nIt was the theory of the Commonwealth that this was a sadistic murder and the condition of the victim\u2019s body as revealed by the medical testimony and by the photographs received in evidence strongly supports this theory.\nThe evidence in this case justified the verdict of murder in the first degree with the penalty fixed at death. The brutality exhibited by this killer clearly proved that he was animated by that malice which is the essential ingredient of murder. Here is a case where malice \u201cis implied from the outrageous circumstances of the act, showing a cruelty of disposition, a heart regardless of social duty and fatally bent on mischief.\u201d In this killer we find that \u201cwickedness of disposition, hardness of heart and cruelty\u201d which Justice Agnew said characterizes the murderer. The evidence also shows that the killer intended to kill. The many savage blows which he inflicted on his victim could have had no other purpose than to kill. The blotting out of the victim\u2019s life was their natural and inevitable consequence. The frequent repetition of these blows shows that the intent to kill was deliberately formed. Whether the intention to kill and the killing, that is, the premeditation and the fatal act, were within a brief space of time or a long space of time is immaterial if the killing was in fact intentional, wilful, deliberate and premeditated. \u201cNo time is too short for a wicked man. to frame in his mind his scheme of murder and to contrive the means of accomplishing it\u201d: (quoted by Justice Agnew from Com. v. Richard Smith in Com. v. Drum supra). As Justice Agnew said in Com. v. Drum: \u201cThe law fixes upon no length of time as necessary to form the intention to kill, but leaves the existence of a fully formed intent as a fact to be determined by the jury, from all the facts and circumstances in the evidence.\u201d\nAmong the assignments of error stressed by the appellant are the first three, which relate to the introduction of photographs taken of the body of the victim while she was still lying on the stairway of the vacant house in which she had been murdered. This question was ruled by us in Com. v. Dreamer, 324 Pa. 220, 188 A. 117, where we said: \u201cIt was competent for the witness who discovered [the victim\u2019s] body to describe exactly what he saw, the condition of the body, and the objects which surrounded it. It was equally competent to present a photograph which portrayed these things more accurately than mere words could do.\u201d We added: \u201cThe admission in evidence of photographs of victims of murder has been sanctioned by this court and by courts of other jurisdictions, provided that the photograph was not offered and was not used for the purpose of inflaming the minds of the jurors against the accused.\u201d (Citing cases.) What we said in that case (which in its motive and methods closely resembles this one) is applicable here: \u201cThe crime itself as necessarily revealed by the testimony of those who saw the body and by the physician who made the required post-mortem examination was of such an atrocious character that no mere photographs could add anything to the feelings which would naturally be aroused in the breast of any civilized human being, against its perpetrator. These photographs did not convict the defendant of this crime. His conviction was based on other evidence, ample and convincing.\u201d These assignments are overruled.\nThe fifth and sixth assignments of error are based on the address of the district attorney. No exception to this address was taken in the proper manner. Appellant\u2019s chief complaint as to the address is that the district attorney argued to the jury in effect that if a life sentence was imposed instead of the death penalty, some future Board of Pardons might release the convict \u201cin five years, ten year, twenty years, ... it can always let them out and it does.\u201d In making that argument the district attorney was indulging in conjecture and was intimating that the Board of Pardons might be derelict in its duty. Such an argument is improper and is out of place in an address by a district attorney. That official should always bear in mind that he is a quasi-judicial officer. See Com. v. Capalla, 322 Pa. 200, 204-5-6, 185 A. 203. The trial judge in his charge clearly and fairly instructed the jury as to its function in fixing the penalty and the remarks of the district attorney, even if properly excepted to, would not under these circumstances be adjudged by us to be prejudicial error.\nThe eighth and ninth assignments of error refer respectively to the admission on the record of prior convictions of this appellant for crimes involving moral turpitude, to wit: sodomy and larceny. This evidence was admissible for two purposes, first, to discredit the defendant, and second, to furnish the jury with data to be used by them in determining the appropriate punishment in the event they found the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree. See Com. v. Herman Petrillo, 341 Pa. 209. The evidence was offered and admitted for the second purpose only. The trial judge in. his charge carefully instructed the jury that the records of defendant\u2019s former convictions \u201chad no place in their deliberations in determining whether this, defendant is guilty\u201d of any crime or \u201cin fixing the degree of guilt\u201d but they could be considered only in fixing the punishment after the jury should come to the conclusion that the defendant was guilty of murder in the first degree.\n\u25a0 No other assignments of error require discussion. All the assignments of error are overruled.\nThe trial was fair, the verdict just, and the penalty appropriate.\nThe judgment is affirmed. The record is remitted to the court below so that the sentence may be executed.\nThe examination made of Mrs. Atkins\u2019 body after her death and the chemical tests made of her blood showed that she had no venereal disease.\n\u201cThe tortures inflicted by the sadist on his victim are often unbelievable. He beats her alive and he sometimes continues to beat her after death ... in short, he falls upon her with the Veritable fury of a wild beast. Mutilations of the cadaver may also be numerous and varied. . . . There is one mutilation that dominates all; it is the sadistic mark, and that is the mutilation of the genital organs\u201d: Medical-Legal Moral Offences \u2014 Thoinot & Weysse, p. 420.\nCom. v. Lewis et al., 1 Addison 278, 282.\nCom. v. Drum, 58 Pa. 9."}
