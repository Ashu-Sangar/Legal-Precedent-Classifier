See Grieb v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 573 Pa. 594, 827 A.2d 422 (2003) (an employee\u2019s inadvertent violation of employer\u2019s work rule does not constitute willful misconduct which would result in a denial of benefits to the employee under Section 402(e) of the Unemployment Compensation Law); Navickas v. Unemployment Compensation Board of Review, 567 Pa. 298, 787 A.2d 284 (2001) (same)."}
