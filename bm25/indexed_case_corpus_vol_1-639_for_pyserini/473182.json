{"id": "473182", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\nPlaintiffs filed a bill in equity against a living defendant seeking to enforce specifically a written contract for the sale of the fixtures, stock in trade and good will of a restaurant with a liquor license. Pending the suit defendant died and her executors were substituted as defendants. The learned court decreed specific performance. From this decree the appeal is taken.\nThe decree was correctly entered. See Cochrane v. Szpakowski, 355 Pa. 357, 49 A. 2d 692.\nUpon the death of defendant her estate passed into the hands of the law for administration and distribution. The decree thus obtained in the court of common pleas must be presented to the orphans\u2019 court for enforcement: Hammett\u2019s Appeal, 83 Pa. 392; Phillips, Admr., v. The Allegheny Valley Railroad Co., 107 Pa. 465; Strouse v. Lawrence, Administratrix, 160 Pa. 421, 28 A. 930; Thompson\u2019s Estate, 130 Pa. Superior Ct. 263, 197 A. 547. Cf. Fitzsimmons v. Lindsay, 205 Pa. 79, 83, 54 A. 488.\nDecree affirmed at cost of appellants."}
