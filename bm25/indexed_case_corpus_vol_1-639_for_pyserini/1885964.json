{"id": "1885964", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill County (one judge dissenting) denying (without prejudice) the petition of nineteen members of the bar of that court (appellants) for a rule to show cause why the respondents (appellees) should not be adjudged in contempt of court. The matter below was entirely ex parte; appellees became participants in this proceeding only before this Court upon receipt of appellants\u2019 briefs on appeal.\nThere is no dispute as to the facts material to this appeal. On February 14, 1961, thirteen members of the bar of Schuylkill County, as officers of that court (later joined by six additional lawyers), presented a written statement to the court en banc, reciting that respondents (officers and agents of a radio station) for more than a year had been making radio broadcasts which \u201cvigorously pursued a course of conduct to influence those, past and present, who serve as members of the Jury . . . and to illegally influence those who may subsequently serve as members of a jury. . . .\u201d The statement assorted also that respondents\u2019 conduct constituted \u201cwhat is commonly known as a \u2018Jury Fix\u2019 \u201d and that the broadcasts were \u201cnot confined to argument and persuasion but also to almost daily threats of intimidation as to people who serve as members of the Jury and to castigate and hold them up to public ridicule in the event that their verdicts were not as suggested . . .\u201d by the broadcasts. Members of the juries were characterized as \u201cbums, incompetents and delinquents.\u201d The statement further recited that the broadcasts \u201crepeatedly castigated all of the Judges\u201d of the court below, \u201cin an apparent endeavor to intimidate the court into handing down sentences, opinions and handling the business of the court in accordance with the ideas, suggestions and opinions . . .\u201d of the radio station.\nThe written statement concluded with a request to the court to give consideration to a rule to show cause why the respondents should not answer to the court for these charges of contempt.\nOn February 20, 1961, the nineteen lawyers presented to the court below a formal sworn petition repeating in essence their prior representations and further alleging that respondents \u201chave almost daily committed contempts of court by their unwarranted and criminal accusations [as to all four judges of the court] that certainly and positively affect the proper administration of justice. . . ,\u201d\nFollowing presentation of the petition, the court took no immediate action upon it. In fact, the petition apparently remained, without disposition, in the .hands of the judge to whom it was presented. Almost eight months later, on October 5, 1961, the complaining lawyers placed the matter upon the current hearing- list, and the president judge assigned the matter to himself. There it remained without hearing or disposition until October 22, 1962, twenty months after the petition. had been initially presented, when the court ordered the petition \u201cdenied without prejudice.\u201d\nOn January 4, 1963, the court below filed the following opinion: \u201cThe matter is now on appeal with the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, appeal having been filed December 2, 1962. It is the opinion of the majority of the Court that the Petition, as filed and as amended, is lacking in form and content to warrant the relief prayed for, to wit: Rule for Contempt of Court. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.)\nAlthough the record lacks sufficient completeness and fails as an adequate basis for determination of the issues sought to be adjudicated by appellants\u2014 but rejected by the court below without hearing, it does, however, suggest the apparent existence of a .local atmosphere which is detrimental to the proper administration of justice. Such a climate invites appropriate corrective action. Nevertheless, it is not essential to our present determination to discuss available remedies or to decide whether the alleged conduct of the respondents constituted contempt of the court below.\nThe power of this Court to review a finding of contempt and to affirm, reverse or modify the order of the lower court is not disputed. We have so acted on numerous occasions and shall continue to do so. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Lofton, 389 Pa. 273, 133 A.2d 203 (1957); Mack Appeal, 386 Pa. 251, 126 A. 2d 679 (1956); Messmore's Estate, 293 Pa. 63, 141 Atl. 724 (1928). However, our appellate courts have found it necessary in only one class of cases to review the failure of a lower court to enter an order of contempt \u2014 where there has been direct disobedience of, or refusal to comply with, a decree or order of that court and the court itself, upon motion or other formal request of the party directly affected by such disobedience, refuses to compel compliance or to hold the disobedient party in contempt. See Davidyan v. Davidyan, 333 Pa. 465, 3 A. 2d 921 (1939); Braunschweiger's Estate, 322 Pa. 394, 185 Atl. 753 (1936) (refusal by fiduciary to distribute); State Grand Lodge v. Morrison, 277 Pa. 41, 120 Atl. 769 (1923); Ensslen Estate, 163 Pa.Super. 246, 60 A. 2d 429 (1948) (refusal to turn over property to administratrix).\nThe instant proceeding is separate and independent of any other action or litigation and obviously was not instigated to enable a private litigant or interest to secure obedience or compliance with an order or decree of court preAdously obtained at the instance of a moving party for the latter\u2019s benefit or protection. It is not concerned with the disregard of a court decree. Its purpose is not enforcement or compliance and does not involve vindication of the authority of the court.\nIt is clear that the court below could determine initially whether it has been contemned. Its authority to do so is unquestioned. In a proceeding of this nature, the court below should be the primary protector of its judicial dignity and conscience, since it is the tribunal primarily concerned with maintaining its dignity and public standing as a judicial forum and is, therefore, empowered to protect itself from insult. However, its decision not to exercise that power is a choice we shall not, in this instance, disturb. We shall affirm its order, particularly since it does not determine the controversy or foreclose any rights. Our determination is necessarily limited to the facts now before us and is in no way a restriction upon our power to review contempt proceedings and to enter appropriate adjudications.\nCourts of law exist primarily to adjudicate justly and expeditiously the controversies of litigants. Our courts must be responsive to current needs and give satisfaction to the causes of litigants, so that when they leave the courtroom they have reason to feel that they have been accorded a prompt and fair hearing. Respect for law and the judicial process will not be promoted by undue delays and other circumstances which offend the .community\u2019s sense of propriety and otherwise fail to attract publie respect and acceptance.\nAll realize that the judicial process, like any other human activity, requires a certain amount of time for the proper performance of its important deliberative function. Immediate determinations are not always possible, particularly in complicated and extended litigation. Rule 78 of this Court recognizes that in some instances 60 days or more may be needed by a lower court to dispose of pending matters and requires that all such undisposed matters be reported to the Prothonotary of this Court with an explanation of the cause of the delay. There can, however, be no acceptable reason for a delay of twenty months in acting upon a motion for rule to show cause.\nThe circumstances suggest the following inquiry: If the petition was so utterly without merit as the court\u2019s brief order indicated, should not the matter have been disposed of far more promptly? On the other hand, if the petition appeared to have the merit which the court\u2019s delay indicated, did it not then deserve at least some opportunity for hearing?\nWe may not, in light of the record presented, refrain from expressing our disapproval of the court\u2019s undue delay as well as the practice by which it was achieved.\nOrder affirmed.\nThe petition also alleged, Inter alia, that respondents \u201cmade an unmitigated attack on one Judge accusing the Judge, in effect, of being in a criminal conspiracy with the keepers of bawdy houses and severely castigated the Judge because of his parole of the defendant . . . and without justification made a vicious attack upon another Judge ... by saying in effect that that Judge was in a criminal conspiracy with gamblers and violators of the liquor laws and that said Judge by his modest sentence and sentences was giving to those defendants \u2018A mere slap on the wrist and' an invitation to go out and commit further crime.\u2019 That- as to another Judge . . . they made the accusation that that Judge was engaging in a criminal conspiracy as to jurors.\u201d\nThe record consists only of the lawyers\u2019 written, statement dated February 14, 1961, their formal petition dated and presented February 20, 1961, the court\u2019s order of October 22, 1962, and the opinion dated January 4, 1963.\nSuch action is undoubtedly available in one or more of the spheres of governmental responsibility.\nRule 78 was adopted and is enforceable under the general supervisory authority of this Court over the courts of the Commonwealth.\nThe instant matter was not included in any of the monthly reports required of the responsible judge by Rule 78. Unexplained is this omission as well as his reason for the delay."}
