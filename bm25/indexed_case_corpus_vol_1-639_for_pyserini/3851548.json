{"id": "3851548", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice BAER.\nIn December 1999, James Farabaugh (Decedent) suffered a fatal accident while driving an off-highway dump truck within the scope of his employment with New Enterprise Stone & Lime (NESL), the general contractor on a construction site owned by the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC). His wife and administratrix of his estate, Jane Farabaugh, plaintiff/appellee herein (Plaintiff), brought a wrongful death and survival action against PTC and the construction manager of the project, Trumbull Corporation (Trumbull), appellants herein, (collectively Defendants). After discovery, the trial court granted PTC\u2019s and Trumbull\u2019s motions for summary judgment. In an unpublished decision, the Commonwealth Court reversed summary judgment as to PTC, finding that issues of fact remained concerning the applicability of an exception to PTC\u2019s assertion of sovereign immunity. Additionally, the court reversed the summary judgment awarded to Trumbull, concluding that Trumbull owed a duty of care to Decedent and that a question of fact remained as to whether Trumbull\u2019s conduct was a substantial factor in causing Decedent\u2019s injury.\nWe granted allowance of appeal limited to the following two questions:\nWhether the Commonwealth Court erroneously held that the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission had a common law duty to warn the decedent\u2019s employer of any obvious conditions created by the general contractor?\nWhether guidance by the Supreme Court is necessary because the scope of a construction manager\u2019s duty to a contractor\u2019s employee is an issue of first impression in the Commonwealth?\nFarabaugh v. Penna. Tpk. Comm\u2019n and Trumbull Corp., 584 Pa. 160, 882 A.2d 1003 (2005). After reviewing the evidence and the relevant law, we reverse the Commonwealth Court in regard to PTC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and conclude that Plaintiff failed to present a common-law cause of action sufficient to prevent summary judgment in favor of PTC, even viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Plaintiff.\nIn regard to Trumbull\u2019s motion for summary judgment, we refuse to apply an unduly rigid standard in determining the duty construction managers owe to employees of contractors and, instead, acknowledge that a construction manager\u2019s duty is defined by the intent of the contracting parties as reflected by their contractual designation of responsibilities. Under the relevant contract language, we conclude that Trumbull owed a duty of care to Decedent based upon its contractual obligation to perform safety inspections and other monitoring functions. A determination of the scope of the duty and whether this duty was breached, however, requires further development of the record regarding Trumbull\u2019s role on the jobsite and the proximate cause of the accident. Accordingly, we affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s reversal of summary judgment as to Trumbull and remand for further proceedings consistent therewith.\nThe accident in this case occurred during the construction of a section of the Mon/Fayette Expressway designed to link Interstate 70 in Fallowfield Township, Washington County, with Pennsylvania Route 51 in Jefferson Hills Borough, Allegheny County. PTC owned the site and employed Trumbull as the \u201cconstruction manager.\u201d Under the terms of its contract with PTC, Trumbull was to administer, manage, and oversee the construction of several sections of the expressway. Its responsibilities included reviewing and monitoring the on-site safety procedures of the other contractors. When viewed in a light most favorable to the Plaintiff, the record suggests that Trumbull\u2019s supervision encompassed haul roads, given testimony that Trumbull inspectors had authority to take action regarding safety violations on haul roads and that its inspectors had the authority to stop work if they perceived a dangerous condition.\nDecedent\u2019s employer, NESL contracted directly with PTC to be the general contractor of Section 52H of the project, which included the construction of an interchange with toll collection facilities. As part of the project, NESL constructed temporary unpaved haul roads, or access roads, to allow for the transport of materials from one section of the project to another. NESL did not have any contractual relationship with Trumbull and assumed all liability for injuries to its employees on site in its contract with PTC. NESL agreed that \u201cacceptance of the [NESL\u2019s] Safety Program shall not relieve or decrease the liability of [NESL] for Safety.\u201d PTC-NESL Contract at 29. Additionally, NESL agreed that \u201c[n]o provision of these contract documents shall act to make [PTC], the Engineer or any party other than [NESL] solely responsible for safety.\u201d Id.\nOn the afternoon of December 1, 1999, NESL asked Decedent, who usually drove water trucks on the site, to drive a loaded, heavy duty, off-highway dump truck up a hill on one of the haul roads even though he had never driven that type of truck on this worksite. Testimony revealed that Decedent was apprehensive about driving this type of truck, but nonetheless, he took the assignment. While Trumbull contends that Decedent drove off the road to avoid an on-coming grader despite having sufficient room to pass, Plaintiff asserts that the haul road collapsed because of the instability in the hill caused by coal seams. Alternatively, Plaintiff alleged that the haul road did not comply with necessary safety measures given, inter alia, an insufficient berm, the width and grade of the road, and the icy weather conditions. Regardless of the cause, Decedent suffered fatal injuries when the truck plunged down a twenty-eight-foot embankment and landed upside down in four feet of water.\nIn August 2000, Plaintiff filed a complaint against PTC and Trumbull asserting claims pursuant to Pennsylvania\u2019s Wrongful Death and Survival Acts, see 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8301, 8302, alleging that Trumbull and PTC\u2019s negligence was a proximate cause of Decedent\u2019s death. Plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that PTC, as owner of the worksite, breached its common law duty to make the premises reasonably safe for the employees of the contractors, to furnish a work area free of recognized and observable hazards, to take necessary action to support and stabilize the haul road, and to require that the haul road be constructed, graded, maintained, and inspected properly. Plaintiff specifically alleged that the haul road should have been equipped with various safety features such as flaggers to direct traffic, barricades, or radio contact for the truck drivers. Plaintiff raised similar claims against Trumbull, again contending that Trumbull failed in multiple ways to require the proper construction and maintenance of the haul road and failed to inspect the road.\nAfter extensive discovery, PTC and Trumbull filed motions for summary judgment. Initially, we will address all issues relating to PTC\u2019s summary judgment motion, turning our attention in Part II to Trumbull\u2019s motion.\nI. PTC Summary Judgment Motion\nWe reiterate that pursuant to our limited grant of allocatur we address only those aspects of the courts\u2019 decisions and the parties\u2019 arguments relevant to whether Plaintiff had a common-law cause of action against PTC. See supra at 2 n. 2. To highlight the significance of this question, we must consider it in the context of the entire case. In its summary judgment motion, PTC asserted the defense of sovereign immunity as a Commonwealth party. Any assertion of sovereign immunity, however, is subject to the exceptions provided in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522:\n\u00a7 8522. Exceptions to sovereign immunity\n(a) Liability imposed. \u2014 The General Assembly, pursuant to section 11 of Article I of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, does hereby waive, in the instances set forth in subsection\n(b) ..., sovereign immunity as a bar to an action against Commonwealth parties, for damages arising out of a negligent act where the damages would be recoverable under the common law ... if the injury were caused by a person not having available the defense of sovereign immunity.\n(b) Acts which may impose liability. \u2014 The following acts by a Commonwealth party may result in the imposition of liability on the Commonwealth and the defense of sovereign immunity shall not be raised to claims for damages caused by:\n* * * *\n(4) Commonwealth real estate, highways and sidewalks. \u2014 A dangerous condition of Commonwealth agency real estate and sidewalks, including Commonwealth-owned real property, leaseholds in the possession of a Commonwealth agency and Commonwealth-owned real property leased by a Commonwealth agency to private persons, and highways under the jurisdiction of a Commonwealth agency....\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522 (emphasis added). The question this Court accepted for review concerns subsection (a) of Section 8522\u2014 whether under these facts Plaintiff could assert a common-law cause of action against a party, who unlike PTC, did not have available the defense of sovereign immunity.\nAfter PTC asserted the defense of sovereign immunity in its motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff alleged that the case fulfilled the requirements of the exception set forth in Section 8522(a). She maintained, generally, that a common law cause of action sounding in negligence could be asserted against a non-Commonwealth landowner based on a landowner\u2019s duty to the employees of an independent contractor. While the theories underlying the alleged duty tend to overlap and blend in the parties\u2019 arguments and the lower courts\u2019 discussions, we nonetheless distill three potential bases for the duty asserted by Plaintiff. For ease of discussion, we refer to each theory by reference to the related section of the Restatement (Second) of Torts: (1) Section 343, Dangerous Conditions Known To or Discoverable By Possessor; (2) Section 414, Negligence in Exercising Control Retained By Employer; and (3) Sections 416 and 427, collectively referred to as the Peculiar Risk Doctrine. Conversely, PTC argued that even a landowner not subject to sovereign immunity would be shielded from liability under established Pennsylvania law, which generally does not impose a duty on a landowner employing an independent contractor, absent certain exceptions.\nIn May 2002, the trial court entered an order granting PTC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that Plaintiff failed to set forth a claim, recognized at common law, upon which relief could have been granted against a non-Commonwealth party landowner sufficient to satisfy the requirements for an exception to sovereign immunity set forth in Section 8522(a). Without fully considering the first potential theory of duty related to Section 343 (Dangerous Conditions), the court concluded that Plaintiff failed to demonstrate that PTC retained the control over the job site necessary to establish a duty under Section 414 (Retention of Control). The court focused on the language of the contract between NESL and PTC, under which NESL agreed to assume responsibility for all injuries to its employees. Likewise, regarding the third potential source of duty pursuant to Section 416 or 427, the court concluded that the facts of the case, as a matter of law, failed to establish the presence of a peculiar risk, where Decedent merely drove a dump truck on a haul road, a routine method of transporting material around a highway construction site.\nPlaintiff appealed the decision to the Commonwealth Court. Although that court\u2019s decision focused primarily on issues relating to Trumbull, the Commonwealth Court briefly addressed the merits of PTC\u2019s motion for summary judgment. While the court concluded that Plaintiff stated a claim of injury due to a \u201cdefective condition of the land\u201d sufficient to satisfy the requirement for the real estate exception to sovereign immunity under subsection (b)(4) of Section 8522, it did not specifically address Plaintiffs argument regarding dangerous conditions in the land in relation to subsection (a), where Plaintiff asserted that a common law cause of action could arise from a breach of a duty to protect Decedent from a non-obvious dangerous condition inherent in the land, see Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 343. Instead, the court determined that Plaintiff satisfied Section 8522(a) by demonstrating that it exerted sufficient control over the worksite, after considering caselaw related to Section 414. The court based its finding of sufficient control on a safety videotape shown to workers, see infra at 14 n. 11, and PTC\u2019s appointment of on-site safety inspectors. Additionally, the court concluded that PTC \u201cwas charged with the same degree of control as Trumbull exercised,\u201d because Trumbull was PTC\u2019s \u201cagent\u201d in performing safety checks. Based on the factual issue of control pursuant to Plaintiffs Section 414 (Retention of Control) claim, the Commonwealth Court reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to PTC, concluding that Plaintiff avoided the application of sovereign immunity.\nOn appeal to this Court, PTC asserts that the Commonwealth Court erred in reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. PTC contends that the Commonwealth Court erred in failing to find sovereign immunity applicable as a matter of law. In doing so, PTC reasserts many of the issues contested in the courts below. We address the parties\u2019 arguments on the potential application of each assertion of duty of a non-Commonwealth landowner to an employee of an independent contractor under the facts of this case, keeping in mind that our finding of an applicable duty would allow Plaintiff to assert a common law cause of action in negligence necessary to satisfy Section 8522(a)\u2019s requirements for an exception to sovereign immunity, and thus prevent a grant of summary judgment in favor of PTC.\n1. Section 3J/.3: Dangerous Conditions Known or Discoverable By Possessor\nPlaintiff asserts the existence of a common-law cause of action in this case based on the general law imposing a duty of care on possessors of land to business invitees, such as the employees of independent contractors, where a non-obvious, dangerous condition exists on the possessor\u2019s land. As developed through our caselaw, a landowner\u2019s duty regarding such conditions derives from Section 343 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. See, e.g., Crane v. I.T.E. Circuit Breaker Co., 443 Pa. 442, 278 A.2d 362, 363 (1971); Engle v. Reider, 366 Pa. 411, 77 A.2d 621, 625 (1951). Plaintiff alleges that the dangerous condition inherent in the land was the instability of the hillside on which the haul road was constructed due to the existence of coal seams. Deposition testimony, at least for purposes of summary judgment, can be read to support Plaintiffs position that the area contained coal seams, which she alleges could have caused the haul road to collapse given that coal seams provide insufficient support for roadways. Accordingly, Plaintiff argues that she would have a common-law cause of action sounding in negligence against a non-Commonwealth landowner based on its breach of a duty to protect Decedent from the inherent and non-obvious danger of the instability of the hillside upon which NESL built the haul road.\nIn response, PTC cites cases, see, e.g., Engle, 366 Pa. 411, 77 A.2d 621, holding that liability for injuries to a contractor\u2019s employee will not attach when the owner warns the contractor of the dangerous condition because there is no reason for the landowner to \u201cexpect that [the contractor] will not discover or realize the danger,\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 343(b). Additionally, the duty to warn the contractor, according to PTC, is only triggered if the owner has superior knowledge to the contractor regarding the relevant danger or risk. In this ease, PTC argues that NESL was well aware of the danger presented by the alleged coal seams because it was the party responsible for excavating the seams adjacent to the haul road. Accordingly, PTC contends that it did not owe a duty to Decedent pursuant to Section 343(b).\nIn any case sounding in negligence, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) a duty of care; (2) the breach of the duty; (3) a causal connection between the conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual loss or damage resulting to the plaintiff. See R.W. v. Manzek, 585 Pa. 335, 888 A.2d 740, 746 (2005). The question before the Court presents a question of law regarding the duty imposed upon PTC under the facts of this case. See id. The courts of this Commonwealth have spoken to the duty possessors of land have toward the employees of contractors. In cases where a possessor of land employs an independent contractor, this Court has concluded that a possessor of land must use \u201creasonable care to make the premises safe or give adequate and timely warning of dangers known to him but unknown to the contractor or his employees.\u201d Crane, 278 A.2d at 364 (citations omitted); see also Engle, 77 A.2d at 624. \u201cHowever, the possessor of the land can insulate himself from liability by warning the contractor of the existence of any dangerous conditions on the premises which he knows or should know, and need not warn the contractor\u2019s employees.\u201d Id. Moreover, a possessor will not be held responsible for defective conditions of the land if they are the product of the independent contractor\u2019s work. Id.\nAccordingly, Plaintiffs first assertion of a duty, upon which a cause of action could be asserted against PTC if it were a non-Commonwealth party for purposes of the sovereign immunity exception set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(a), must be rejected as lacking the requisite factual predicate under the rule set forth in Crane and Engle. It is without debate that NESL, Decedent\u2019s employer, was fully aware of the potential, non-obvious danger of the alleged instability of the hillside due to the presence of coal seams, given that it was the party responsible for the removal of coal seams nearby. Similarly, to the extent that Plaintiffs allegations can be read to assert non-obvious dangers present in the haul road itself, we find no liability may attach to PTC in this regard, as it is factually undisputed that those conditions would be the product of NESL\u2019s construction and maintenance of the haul road. See Crane, 278 A.2d at 364.\n2. Section klh- Negligence in Exercising Control Retained By Employer\nPlaintiff acknowledges that, generally, landowners employing independent contractors are exempt from liability for injuries to an independent contractor\u2019s employees absent an exercise of control over the means and methods of the contractor\u2019s work, see, e.g., Celender v. Allegheny County San. Auth., 208 Pa.Super. 390, 222 A.2d 461, 464 (1966) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 414). Plaintiff claims that PTC demonstrated its control over the site through a safety orientation videotape shown to all employed on the site asserting that PTC\u2019s representatives would be \u201clooking after your interests as well as the owner\u2019s.\u201d She also asserted that PTC retained control by employing an on-site safety inspector as well as contracting with Trumbull for construction management services. She argues that this was not the typical situation of a property owner visiting a construction site to check on the progress, which has been determined not to constitute control, but instead involved an owner who employed its own on-site safety representative who had the authority to stop work. Plaintiff asserted that at the very least, a jury issue existed as to whether PTC retained sufficient control to prevent summary judgment on the sovereign immunity exception.\nPTC contends that Plaintiff failed to establish control necessary to trigger a duty from which a common-law cause of action could arise. In support, PTC relies upon caselaw holding that an owner\u2019s reservation of rights to inspect the work or even to stop work does not satisfy the necessary control element. See Celender, 208 Pa.Super. 390, 222 A.2d 461. Rather, PTC contends that the caselaw requires demonstration of control over how the contractor performs the assigned tasks. PTC maintains that the logic behind this rule is to allow an owner to rely upon the contractor\u2019s expertise in the construction project.\nIn support, PTC cites the recent Commonwealth Court decision in LaChance v. Michael Baker Corp., 869 A.2d 1054 (Pa.Cmwlth.2005), which it asserts conflicts with the decision of the Commonwealth Court sub judice. In LaChance, the Commonwealth Court addressed a claim of liability in a case where the property owner, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), had the power to supervise, inspect, and stop its contractor\u2019s work. The court concluded that liability did not attach because \u201cPennDOT\u2019s inspection rights, exercised to assure itself that [the contractor] performed its work safely, as [the contractor] had agreed in its contract, did not make PennDOT guarantor of the safety of [the contractor\u2019s] employees.\u201d Id. at 1060-61. In applying the law to the facts of the case, PTC asserts that it did not control the means and methods of construction of the haul road or the decision to assign the fatal task to Decedent, which it contends were entirely under the control of NESL, who designed, built, and maintained the haul road at issue. Thus, it argues that summary judgment based on sovereign immunity was appropriate.\nIn Hader v. Coplay Cement Manufacturing Co., 410 Pa. 139, 189 A.2d 271 (1963), we considered the specific duties of property owners in cases where an owner turns over control of its property to an independent contractor. Initially, we observed, \u201c[ojrdinarily one who engages an independent contractor is not responsible for the acts of such independent contractor or his employees\u201d because \u201ca person is not liable for the acts of negligence of another\u201d absent a master and servant relationship; \u201c[responsibility goes with authority.\u201d Id. at 277. Accordingly, \u201c[a]n owner of land who delivers temporary possession of a portion of the land to an independent contractor owes no duty of care to the employees of the independent contractor with respect to an obviously dangerous condition on that portion of the land in the possession of the contractor.\u201d Id.; see also Brletich v. U.S. Steel Corp., 445 Pa. 525, 285 A.2d 133, 134 (1971). So long as the owner is out of control of the land, no duty is placed on the owner. Id.\nIn considering whether an owner has retained control by monitoring the work site, this Court stated, \u201cIt is normal for an owner or an interested party to visit the scene of new construction to observe the progress of work. Such inspections of finished work furnish no evidence of a right to control the workmen____[Inspection of finished work shows only an interest in the result to be obtained.\u201d Hader, 189 A.2d at 278 (citations omitted). Accordingly, we found frequent visits of plant managers \u201cinnocuous\u201d when there was \u201cnot a scintilla of evidence that either [the plant manager or vice-president] at any time gave, or attempted to give, any instructions as to the manner of installation of the [equipment at issue].\u201d Id.,see also Emery v. McCollum, 725 A.2d 807, 813 (Pa.Super.1999) (finding that owner\u2019s employment of liaison to monitor compliance with contractual provisions did not constitute assumption of control over the contractor\u2019s work); Celender, 222 A.2d at 463 (quoting Restatement (Second) op Torts \u00a7 414, supra, at 14 n. 11, for the proposition that mere ability to order work stopped to inspect progress or to make recommendations for alterations does not constitute control). Similarly, as noted by PTC, the Commonwealth Court in LaChance found that Penn-DOT did not exert the necessary control over the worksite merely by including in its contract a provision retaining the right of inspection and the authority to suspend work.\nBased on this caselaw, we reject Plaintiffs attempt to argue that there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning PTC\u2019s retention of control of the worksite by way of the videotape, its provisions for safety inspections, or its employment of Trumbull, given the well-established law of this Commonwealth that such actions do not constitute control. As the Commonwealth Court held in LaChance, \u201c[t]o find liability simply because PennDOT addresses the issue of safety in its construction contracts would only encourage PennDOT to disregard safety in its contracts. Sound public policy, however, dictates that PennDOT monitor the safety of its highway construction projects and continue to pay its contractors to conduct safe job sites.\u201d LaChance, 869 A.2d at 1064. It would likewise disserve public policy to impose liability on PTC for going one step further and hiring a contractor specifically to supervise safety issues on site in addition to requiring its general contractor to be responsible for safety under its own contract with PTC. Instead, we conclude that under NESL\u2019s contract with PTC, PTC turned over control of the worksite to its general contractor, NESL, and did not retain control over NESL\u2019s means and methods for purposes of a Section 414 analysis. See Hader, 410 Pa. 139, 189 A.2d 271.\n3. Sections hl6 and 1\u00a1,27: the Peculiar Risk Doctrine\nIn the event that the courts concluded that PTC did not retain control, Plaintiff asserted that the facts of the case fit within the doctrine of peculiar risks or special dangers \u2014 an exception to the doctrine of non-liability for owners out of possession. Plaintiff relied on the Superior Court decision in McDonough v. U.S. Steel Corp., 228 Pa.Super. 268, 324 A.2d 542 (1974), in which the court found the owner liable based on the peculiar risk inherent in the decedent\u2019s task of driving an off-highway dump truck on the edge of an unstable fifty-foot-high pile of ore at night without proper lighting. Plaintiff alleged that the facts of this case fit within the McDonough analysis in that the work site did not contain the necessary safety precautions for a similar off-highway dump truck where, inter alia, the road was improperly graded, lacked appropriate visual markers of the road edge, and was located adjacent to an excavated area.\nPTC contended that it does not fit within the exception because the peculiar risk or special danger must be foreseeable at the time the contract is executed and not within the usual and ordinary risk associated with the general type of work. See Emery, 725 A.2d at 814. PTC asserts that it was not foreseeable that NESL would construct an allegedly faulty haul road or choose an unqualified party to drive the truck. Moreover, PTC maintains that all construction work includes some degree of risk and that driving a truck on a haul road is not an unusual risk on a highway construction site. Accordingly, PTC asserts that this exception does not apply and, thus, summary judgment based on sovereign immunity is appropriate.\nWe previously have summarized the rule presented by Sections 416 and 427 of the Restatement: \u201cthe employer remains liable for injuries resulting from danger which he should contemplate at the time he enters the contract, and cannot shift to the contractor responsibility for such dangers, or for taking precautions against them.\u201d Brletich, 285 A.2d at 136. We further noted that the peculiar risk/special dangers provisions are not intended to apply to \u201cthe taking of routine precautions of a kind which any careful contractor could reasonably be expected to take, against all of the ordinary and customary dangers which may arise in the course of the contemplated work.\u201d Id. at 137. We held that so long as the employer exercises reasonable care in selecting a competent contractor, liability for failing to take precautions will not attach. Id. As summarized by the Superior Court, the exception requires a \u201ctwo-fold test: (1) whether the risk is foreseeable to the owner at the time the contract is executed ... and (2) whether the risk is different from the usual and ordinary risk associated with the general type of work done.\u201d Emery, 725 A.2d 807, 814 (Pa.Super.1999).\nWe conclude that under the facts presented here, there was no peculiar risk or special danger involved in the task of driving an off-highway dump truck on a highway construction site. We reject Plaintiffs reliance on McDonough. See supra at 19 n. 16. Not only did the accident in this case occur during a routine event on a construction site, but even under the significantly more dangerous facts of McDonough, which involved the task of driving a truck close to the edge of an inherently unstable pile of ore, the court only found liability where the nature of the task required it to be performed at night. Any responsibility for improper construction or maintenance of a standard feature of a highway construction project must lie with NESL, or as explained below, with Trumbull. By finding that the Peculiar Risk Doctrine does not apply to this case, we conclude that PTC has no duty to the employees of NESL, the general contractor that assumed control of the worksite pursuant to its contract with PTC.\nConsequently, after review of all Plaintiffs asserted bases for a duty owed by PTC to Decedent, we conclude that summary judgment in favor of PTC is appropriate absent a duty pursuant to which a common-law cause of action sounding in negligence could be brought against a similarly situated party not protected by sovereign immunity. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(a).\nII. Trumbull Summary Judgment\nIn its summary judgment motion, Trumbull asserted that, as a construction manager, it owed no duty to Decedent, whose death resulted from allegedly negligent construction and maintenance of the haul road by NESL. In support, Trumbull observed that this Court in Leonard v. Commonwealth Dept. of Transp., 565 Pa. 101, 771 A.2d 1238, 1241-42 (2001), refused to impose liability where a general contractor did not exercise control over the worksite and the injured worker\u2019s employer assumed responsibility for safety compliance. Trumbull focused on this Court\u2019s reasoning that responsibility should lie with the party actually performing the work where that party has immediate knowledge of the potential hazards of the work. According to Trumbull, NESL, not Trumbull, assumed sole responsibility in its contract with PTC for the safety of NESL\u2019s employees on the site. Accordingly, it argued that it should not be held liable for the accident where it had no control over the construction or maintenance of the haul road or the decision to employ Decedent.\nPlaintiff responded that the Leonard line of cases was inapplicable because the question was not one of liability based on control over the worksite, but instead of liability for negligent performance of contractual duties. Plaintiff noted that Pennsylvania courts have imposed a legal duty, sometimes referred to as a social duty, on contracting parties to perform their contractual obligations so as not to injure third parties, citing Evans v. Otis Elevator Co., 403 Pa. 13, 168 A.2d 573 (1961). Under this caselaw, a plaintiff may bring a cause of action sounding in tort based upon a defendant\u2019s negligent performance of contractual obligations owed to another party. Plaintiff notes that the principal established in Otis Elevator has been formalized in Section 324A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts. See Cantwell v. Allegheny County, 506 Pa. 35, 483 A.2d 1350 (1984).\nPlaintiff argued that Trumbull had assumed a duty of care to Decedent to perform its contractual obligations to provide safety oversight and inspection services in a manner that did not compromise the safety of the workers on the worksite. Plaintiff contended that Trumbull\u2019s failure to exercise reasonable care in performing the services owed under its contract with PTC resulted in Decedent\u2019s injury. In support, Plaintiff submitted an expert report suggesting that Trumbull failed to perform its contractual duties as construction manager in relation to the haul road. Moreover, Plaintiff contended that Decedent relied upon the assertion in the safety videotape that safety inspectors, such as Trumbull, were \u201clooking after your interests as well as the owner\u2019s [interests].\u201d\nIn addressing Trumbull\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the trial court acknowledged Plaintiffs argument that Trumbull\u2019s duty arose from its contractual obligations, but, nevertheless, focused its analysis on whether Trumbull exercised control over the means and methods used by NESL to construct and maintain the haul roads. Applying the law relating to possessors of land discussed in relation to PTC\u2019s argument and this Court\u2019s decision in Leonard, the trial court found that the evidence showed that Trumbull did not exercise control over the means or method of NESL\u2019s work, and thus could not be held liable. Instead, it found that NESL had assumed sole responsibility for the safety of its workers in its contract with PTC.\nThe court briefly addressed Plaintiffs argument for imposing a social duty to perform contractual obligations so as not to harm third parties. It distinguished the case relied upon by Plaintiff, see St. Clair v. B & L Paving Co., 270 Pa.Super. 277, 411 A.2d 525 (1979). The court concluded that the defendant in Si. Clair had created an artificial condition of uneven pavement that led to the injury suffered by the third party, whereas Plaintiff merely alleged that Trumbull failed to inspect properly the condition created by NESL. The court dismissed this argument, concluding that the potential negligent conduct was that of NESL and was not connected to an alleged breach of Trumbull\u2019s contractual duty, without acknowledging the expert report submitted by Plaintiff.\nOn appeal, the Commonwealth Court acknowledged that Trumbull asserted a lack of control over the allegedly negligent construction of the haul road, but found that Trumbull had a contractual duty to inspect and supervise the project, which included inspection of haul roads. The court concluded that negligent failure of its contractual obligation to inspect could trigger a duty to third parties such as Decedent sounding in tort. Cmwlth. Ct. Slip Op. at 5 (citing Evans v. Otis Elevator Co., 403 Pa. 13, 168 A.2d 573 (1961)). Moreover, it concluded that material questions of fact remained concerning whether Trumbull performed its duty adequately, given the testimony and the expert report\u2019s references to potential safety concerns regarding the haul road. \u201c[T]he Court determine[d] that Trumbull owed a duty to Decedent and that the trial court erred in holding otherwise. The extensive contractual commitments by Trumbull are rendered a nullity if it is held that Trumbull had no enforceable safety obligations.\u201d Cmwlth. Ct. Slip Op. at 11 (citation omitted).\nOn appeal to this Court, Trumbull seeks our determination of the scope of a construction manager\u2019s duty to employees of other contractors. Trumbull attempts to define the role and responsibilities of a construction manager by citation to the Construction Management Association\u2019s definition of construction management as the \u201cprocess of professional management applied to a construction program from conception to completion for the purpose of controlling time, costs, and quality.\u201d Defendants Brief at 17. Under its contract with PTC, Trumbull contends it was merely responsible for monitoring the contractors\u2019 compliance with their own safety plans. Indeed, Trumbull asserts, the safety plans submitted by NESL did not even mention haul roads.\nAsserting that its role involved mere oversight, Trumbull argued for application of the law this Court has applied to possessors of land and general contractors out of possession of property. See Hader, 410 Pa. 139, 189 A.2d 271; Leonard, 565 Pa. 101, 771 A.2d 1238. It asserts that it did not control the means and methods of the activities related to the accident in this case, and thus, should not be liable for the resultant injury. Instead, Trumbull notes that NESL took full responsibility for any liability resulting from its work. Accordingly, Trumbull argues that it was entitled to summary judgment because it owed no duty to Decedent in regard to the safety of the haul roads or the decision to assign him the task that eventually led to his death.\nTrumbull rejects Plaintiffs attempt to impose liability based on its contractual responsibilities. Without directly addressing Otis Elevator, Trumbull argues that liability under Restatement Section 324A only applies to \u201csins of commission.\u201d Additionally, Trumbull contends that Plaintiff did not satisfy any of the three triggering situations set forth in Section 324A (a-c) because she failed to demonstrate that (a) Trumbull\u2019s \u201cfailure to exercise reasonable care increase[d] the risk of such harm;\u201d (b) \u201cTrumbull had undertaken to perform a duty owed by [PTC] to [Decedent]\u201d or (c) that \u201cthe harm [was] suffered because of reliance of [PTC] or [Decedent] upon the undertaking.\u201d See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 324A. Trumbull asserts that negligent inspection cannot meet the requirements for a duty under Section 324A. Accordingly, Trumbull argues that summary judgment was appropriate because it did not owe Decedent a duty of care.\nIn response, Plaintiff asserts that the precedent reflected in Leonard does not apply to the case at bar. In contrast to the situation addressed in Leonard, Plaintiff argues that this case does not involve an owner relinquishing control over the construction site or a general contractor releasing control over the means and method of the work. Instead, according to Plaintiff, this case involves the assumption of a contractual duty of inspection that was not and could not be delegated to the other contractors. Even though NESL assumed responsibility for the safety of its workers, that responsibility did not relieve Trumbull of its safety and monitoring obligations under the contract with PTC. According to Plaintiff, if Trumbull could delegate all safety responsibilities to the trade contractors, there would be little need for PTC to employ Trumbull to supervise the safety procedures.\nInstead, Plaintiff contends that a construction manager is subject to the same principles of duty as any other professional on a construction worksite. Relying on Otis Elevator, she maintains that the courts of this Commonwealth have imposed a social duty on contracting parties to act without negligence when it is foreseeable that third parties could be injured by the negligence. She rejects Trumbull\u2019s argument that Section 324A only applies to sins of commission, noting that courts have applied a companion section, Section 323 with similar language, to sins of omission. See Hamil v. Bashline, 481 Pa. 256, 392 A.2d 1280 (1978). Plaintiff maintains that Trumbull\u2019s contractual responsibilities triggered a social duty to Decedent in this case. According to Plaintiff, Trumbull was responsible under its contract for ensuring that the various contractors complied with the safety plans that Trumbull had approved as compliant with the requirements set forth by PTC. Plaintiff finds that \u201c[i]t is inconceivable that Trumbull did not understand that its role was to assure the safety of the workers on the job, regardless of who employed them.\u201d Applying Section 324A(c), Plaintiff argues that Decedent reasonably relied upon the promise made in the videotape that Trumbull would look after the employees\u2019 interests as well as the owner\u2019s interest. She also asserts that reasonable minds could differ on the question of whether Trumbull\u2019s failure to correct the alleged flaws in the haul road contributed to or caused the accident.\nPlaintiff argues that the issue of whether Trumbull fully performed its obligations under the contract is an issue for the factfinder, and thus not appropriate for summary judgment. Nonetheless, she highlights the report of her expert who opined that Trumbull \u201cfailed in the performance of [its] contractual duties in keeping with accepted industry practices ... and failed to enforce basic safety practices by trying to limit [its] role to that of a reviewer instead of enforcing contractual and mandated safety regulations.\u201d Plaintiffs Brief at 24.\nWe granted allowance of appeal in part to consider whether this Court could define the duty, if any, that construction managers owe to employees of other contractors. Initially, we reject Trumbull\u2019s attempt to graft the analysis used for general contractors and possessors of land onto construction managers. The Leonard and Hader lines of cases relate to situations where an employer reserves the right to supervise and inspect an independent contractor. These cases consider whether and to what extent the owner or general contractor has delegated responsibility for the work on the property to a subcontractor. In contrast, the case at bar does not involve the delegation of responsibility from Trumbull to NESL, but rather the assumption of responsibilities. Trumbull and NESL did not have a contractual relationship; instead, each had contractual obligations to PTC. While we acknowledge NESL\u2019s uncontested assumption of liability for injuries sustained by its employees, we cannot ignore Trumbull\u2019s positive assumption of responsibility to inspect and supervise the safety procedures on the work site.\nFinding the Hader and Leonard line of cases inapplicable, we next consider whether we can define generally the appropriate role and resultant duty of construction managers. While the parties assert that the position of construction manager is a relatively new position, this Court has considered the role before. In Malloy, this Court exempted construction managers from compliance with the competitive bidding process that is statutorily required for more typical construction services. Malloy, 540 Pa. 308, 657 A.2d 915, 920 (1995). We described the role of a construction manager as \u201cgo[ing] directly to the overall success of the project to see that the contract is fully complied with as to the quantity and quality of material and workmanship\u201d and viewed the role of a construction manager to be more similar to that of an architect and other professional services for which quality of service is of paramount concern.\nWhile the holding of Malloy has little application to the question currently before us, it nonetheless is demonstrative of why we cannot create a defined duty for all construction managers. In summarizing the contractual duties of the construction manager in Malloy, Mr. Justice Castille thoroughly surveyed the contractual duties at two stages of the construction project, yet did not mention any obligation regarding safety inspections \u2014 an obligation central to the issue in this case and fully addressed in the contract between PTC and Trumbull. See Malloy, 540 Pa. 308, 657 A.2d 915, 919-920 (1995).\nSimilarly, our decision in Marshall v. Port Auth. of Allegheny County, 524 Pa. 1, 568 A.2d 931 (1990), demonstrates the diversity among the contractual responsibilities of construction managers. In Marshall, an injured employee of the general contractor on a Port Authority construction project brought suit against the Port Authority and the engineering firm that provided construction management services. In finding that the engineering firm did not have a duty to protect the employee in that case, we scrutinized the language of various amendments to the contract between the engineering firm and the Port Authority. The majority concluded that the applicable amendment did not impose a duty to inspect the site and ensure the safety of the workers because the firm was responsible not for assuring compliance with safety procedures but with \u201cassuring] delivery of the specified systems and facilities in accordance with contract drawings and specifications.\u201d Id. at 936. We concluded that the firm was responsible for the end result, not safety procedures. Additionally, the majority recognized that other provisions of the contract relegated the firm\u2019s on-site safety role to passive duties such as the collection of written safety programs and reports rather than an active duty to inspect the jobsite. Id. at 937. The court noted that this was in contrast to a prior version of the contract that did provide for a more active role, requiring the firm to review \u201ccontractors\u2019 practices and procedures to minimize hazards associated with construction operations.\u201d Id. at 9, 568 A.2d at 936.\nAccordingly, given the differences between Trumbull\u2019s contract in this case, the versions of the contracts in Marshall, and the contract in Malloy, we decline to provide a rigid definition of a construction manager or impose a correspondingly static duty on all construction managers. Instead, we find it preferable to allow owners and construction managers to define their roles and responsibilities in each contract according to the needs of each project and leaving courts to consider on a case by case basis whether such responsibilities trigger a duty to other workers on the jobsite.\nPursuant to this holding, we must review the obligations Trumbull incurred in its contract with PTC and consider whether those obligations result in a duty to Decedent to perform the contractual obligations owed to PTC in a non-negligent manner. Unlike the passive responsibility evidenced in the applicable version of the contract in Marshall, Trumbull was paid to assume an active role in assuring safety on the worksite, agreeing to \u201cdevelop, implement, maintain and monitor a comprehensive project safety/insurance program.\u201d See Open End Inspection Agreement, supra, at 4 n. 4. Moreover, Trumbull asserted that it considered safety of \u201cparamount importance\u201d and, rather than suggesting a passive role in safety compliance, it agreed to interview applicants to be the contractors\u2019 safety representatives and monitor their performance and \u201cmonitor the contractors\u2019 compliance\u201d with safety regulations on a \u201cfrequent\u201d and \u201cregular schedule.\u201d See Technical Proposal, supra, at 4 n. 4. It would not be appropriate, however, for us to determine exactly what Trumbull was expected to do to comply with the responsibilities it assumed. Indeed, we believe the inquiry regarding what level of review and inspection the parties intended should be left to the factfinder who will have the opportunity to consider the testimony of the parties and the parties\u2019 experts.\nDespite factual questions regarding the details of Trumbull\u2019s safety responsibilities, we may still consider whether the general safety obligations assumed in the contract could trigger a duty to others on the jobsite actionable in tort. It has long been the law of this Commonwealth that a contracting party may owe a duty, imposed by law and society, to perform its contractual obligations in such a manner as to avoid injury to third parties:\nGenerally, a party to a contract does not become liable for a breach thereof to one who is not a party thereto. However, a party to a contract by the very nature of his contractual undertaking may place himself in such a position that the law will impose upon him a duty to perform his contractual undertaking in such manner that third persons \u2014 strangers to the contract \u2014 will not be injured thereby; Prosser, Torts (2nd ed.1955), \u00a7 85, pp. 514-519. It is not the contract per se which creates the duty; it is the law which imposes the duty because of the nature of the undertaking in the contract.\nOtis Elevator, 168 A.2d at 575. In Otis Elevator, we held that a company that contracted to inspect its customer\u2019s elevator could be liable in tort to an employee of the customer whose injury resulted from the company\u2019s negligent performance of its contractual obligation to inspect the elevators, regardless of any privity of contract. We concluded, \u201cIf a person undertakes by contract to make periodic examinations and inspections of equipment, such as elevators, he should reasonably foresee that the normal and natural result of his failure to properly perform such undertaking might result in injury not only to the owner of the equipment but also to third persons, including the owner\u2019s employees.\u201d Id. at 575-76. We noted that the \u201corbit\u201d of the duty is \u201cmeasured by the nature and scope of [the] contractual undertaking.\u201d Id. at 576.\nAs noted by Plaintiff, the duty articulated in Otis Elevator has been formalized in Section 324A of the Restatement. In Cantwell v. Allegheny County, 506 Pa. 35, 483 A.2d 1350 (1984), this Court first applied Section 324A of the Restatement, noting that \u201cthe essential provisions of this section have been the law in Pennsylvania for many years,\u201d citing Otis Elevator.\nAlthough this Court has not specifically applied the holding in Otis Elevator or Section 324A to construction managers, we have nonetheless considered the potential duties owed to a contractor\u2019s employees arising from a construction manager\u2019s contractual safety obligations. In Marshall, the majority declined to find that the engineering firm owed a duty to the general contractor\u2019s injured employee, but it did not rule out the possibility that a duty would have arisen under a prior version of the contract assigning the firm a more active role in worksite safety. Indeed, the dissenting justices in Marshall would have found a duty to protect third parties from negligent performance of the applicable contract in Marshall, despite the firm\u2019s passive safety duties.\nAccordingly, we reject Trumbull\u2019s suggestion that Section 324A cannot apply to negligent performance of a contractual inspection obligation because it would require this Court to overturn the longstanding precedent in Otis Elevator. Moreover, the plain language of Section 324A merely requires an undertaking to \u201crender services to another,\u201d which we find to encompass the rendering of inspection services. As in Otis Elevator, we conclude that it was foreseeable that a failure to perform properly the active safety role assumed by Trumbull under its contract with PTC could result in injuries to the workers on the site. Accordingly, we hold that Trumbull owed a duty to perform its safety obligations under its contract with PTC so as not to injure Decedent.\nThe extent of the duty and the subsequent questions of breach and causation remain to be measured by \u201cthe nature and scope of [the] contractual undertaking.\u201d Otis Elevator, at 576. Given the questions of fact discussed previously regarding the scope of Trumbull\u2019s contractual obligations, we must defer again to the factfinder to determine whether there was a breach of Trumbull\u2019s duty to perform the obligations in a manner that would not injure Decedent, whether the alleged breach was a substantial factor in causing Decedent\u2019s injuries, as well as any other appropriate inquiries which may arise as the case proceeds on remand. As these issues are obviously not appropriate for summary judgment, we affirm the decision of the Commonwealth Court reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Trumbull, and remand to the trial court for further proceedings. As stated above, we reverse the Commonwealth Court as to PTC\u2019s motion for summary judgment and reinstate that portion of the trial court\u2019s order.\nJustice BAER delivered the Opinion of the Court.\nChief Justice CAPPY, and Justice CASTILLE, SAYLOR, EAKIN and BAER and Justice BALDWIN join Part I.\nJustice NEWMAN, and Justice EAKIN and BAER and Justice BALDWIN join Part II.\nJustice NEWMAN files a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which Chief Justice CAPPY and Justice CASTILLE join.\n. While not discussed in the briefs, we presume that Plaintiff did not bring negligence claims against NESL because it was subject to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as Decedent\u2019s employer.\n2. The Court specifically declined to hear issues relating to proximate cause and whether the real estate exception to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(b)(4), would apply to PTC. We nevertheless acknowledge that the language of Section 8522 presents some conceptual questions. Generally, sovereign immunity provides a bar against the assertion of any claim, thus preventing courts from reaching issues of duty or liability. However, Section 8522(a) grants an exception to sovereign immunity when \u201cdamages would be recoverable under the common law ... if the injury were caused by a person not having available the defense of sovereign immunity.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(a). Thus, the statute invokes questions of duty and liability inherent in any question of recovery of damages under common law prior to a determination of the application of sovereign immunity. However, given the holdings of the courts below and the arguments of the parties on the issues granted review, we decline to speak to the mechanics of Section 8522. Instead, we limit our discussion of the procedural history and our analysis to the issues granted.\nWe additionally acknowledge that the question relating to PTC, as framed in our order granting review, does not engage fully the heart of Plaintiff's arguments below or the holdings of the lower courts, which focus on obvious dangers created by NESL, the general contractor, as well as non-obvious dangers inherent in PTC's land which were not created by the general contractor. As the parties discussed the issue ably, we recognize that the true question raised is whether Plaintiff has presented a cause of action against PTC with regard to either obvious or non-obvious dangers, sufficient to meet the requirements for exemption to sovereign immunity set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(a). See infra at 7.\n. Under well established law, an appellate court may disturb the decision of a trial court granting or denying summary judgment pursuant to Pa.R.C.P. 1035.1-1035.5 only if it determines that the trial court committed an error of law or abused its discretion. See Strine v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, MCARE Fund, 586 Pa. 395, 894 A.2d 733, 737-38 (2006). In considering summary judgment motions, both trial and appellate courts must view the evidence of record in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, and they should grant sum-: mary judgment only where the \"record clearly shows that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d P.J.S. v. Pennsylvania State Ethics Comm\u2019n, 555 Pa. 149, 723 A.2d 174, 176 (1999). An issue is material if \"its resolution could affect the outcome of the case under the governing law.\u201d Strine, 894 A.2d at 738. Accordingly, we present the facts of this case in a light most favorable to the Plaintiff as the non-moving party.\n. In relevant part, Trumbull's Open-End Inspection Agreement with PTC included Paragraph 12, entitled \u201cSafety/insurance,\u201d provides:\nSafety and Insurance \u2014 Develop, implement, maintain and monitor a comprehensive project safety/insurance program in accordance with the \"wrap-up\u201d insurance guidelines. Monitor each contactor and subcontractor for compliance with the contractors\u2019 insurance provisions in the contract document. Quarterly safety/insurance review meetings will be required.\nOpen-End Inspection Agreement at 7 (emphasis added).\nThe Technical Proposal included Task 12 as one of the construction manager's tasks:\nSafety is of paramount importance to [Trumbull] in every activity we perform. On the basis that PTC will purchase and maintain a \"Wrap-up\u201d insurance program for this project, we will provide a Safety/insurance Monitor to oversee the program. Our Safety/insurance Monitor will be PTC's agent and representative in matters of construction safety and the project Wrap-Up Insurance Policy at the worksite. We will review and approve contractor emergency procedures and site safety plans, interview applicants for contractors\u2019 Safety Representatives, and make recommendations, monitor the Safety Representatives\u2019 performance, and monitor the contractors\u2019 compliance with OSHA and other applicable regulations at all work operations. Monitoring will be frequent and on a regular schedule. We will organize monthly walk-through safety tours with PTC, Insurance carrier, and contractor representatives, and arrange and conduct other safety/insurance meetings as required. Through our Project Control System, we will develop and maintain a log of Worker\u2019s [sic] Compensation and General Liability Claims as well as maintain a file of all claim reports.\nWe will coordinate the investigation, reporting and follow-up of all claims submitted via PTC\u2019s chosen Insurance Program.\nWe will continually monitor the peiformance of all contractors\u2019 workers and recommend removal from work any employee deemed unsuitable for reasons of safety and loss control.\nTechnical Proposal attached to Open-End Inspection Agreement at 12 (emphasis added).\n. Plaintiff cites the contract between PTC and NESL, as stating \"The [PTC], the [PTC\u2019s] Safety Representative, the Engineer, the Insurance Carrier ... or other authorized Safety Representatives have the authority to suspend work in progress when necessary to enforce mandatory safety requirements until the condition is corrected.\u201d PTC-NESL Contract at 27. Plaintiff cites the deposition of Thomas Carey, Trumbull's Project Manager, in which he testified that if a safety monitor noticed a dangerous condition on a haul road it would be reported and addressed. Joint Appendix to Plaintiff's Brief in Opposition to Defendant's Summary Judgment Motions (hereinafter, \"Plaintiff's Appendix\"), Exh. G at 34-35. While we must view the evidence in a light most favorable to Plaintiff at this stage in the litigation, we recognize that it will be in the factfinder\u2019s discretion to determine whether and to what extent these statements accurately reflect the situation on the worksite.\n. See Plaintiff\u2019s Appendix, Exh. D, Deposition Testimony of Richard McElhaney, a Trumbull safety monitor, at 72 (\"We never determined if [the haul road] did collapseL] reason being that when a truck fell over the edge, I mean it is hard to determine if it collapsed or if the damage to the side of the hill was caused from the vehicle itself.\u201d); Plaintiff's Appendix, Exh. I, Union Township Police Department Report (\u201cThe Deceased drove the truck too close to the right hand edge of the roadway and the edge of the roadway gave away causing the truck to roll down a 30\u2019 embankment....\").\n. Plaintiff additionally claimed that PTC\u2019s duty could arise under Section 324A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, (entitled \u201cLiability To Third Person For Negligent Performance Of Undertaking\u201d). While the other three theories remain subject to dispute as discussed in detail, infra, the allegation under Section 324A was not addressed by either of the courts below or the parties before this Court. Consequently, we do not address that issue further in relation to PTC.\n. As noted previously, this Court did not grant review of PTC's issue relating to the real estate exception in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(b).\n. In a footnote, the court considered Plaintiffs claim that she could fall within the exception to the rule that landowners who do not exert control over the land cannot be liable for worker\u2019s injuries under Section 414. As discussed infra, the exception is based on the peculiar risk doctrine of Sections 416 and 427 of the Restatement. Although the court did not need to address the exception given that it found in Plaintiff\u2019s favor in regard to the Section 414 issue, it nonetheless concluded that Plaintiff did not establish a peculiar risk or dangerous condition because haul roads are a standard aspect of highway construction sites. Plaintiff has not appealed from this determination, presumably because the Commonwealth Court granted the relief she sought. See Hosp. & Health Ass\u2019n of Pennsylvania v. Dept. of Public Welfare, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 585 Pa. 106, 888 A.2d 601, 607 n. 11 (noting that party that is not aggrieved by a court\u2019s ultimate decision is not required to file an appeal or cross-appeal). Accordingly, we do not consider that Plaintiff has waived this issue, and therefore, we address the potential application of the exception because it remains a significant aspect of PTC's argument in favor of summary judgment, see infra at 18.\n. \u00a7 343. Dangerous Conditions Known To Or Discoverable By Possessor\nA possessor of land is subject to liability for physical harm caused to his invitees by a condition on the land if, but only if, he\n(a) knows or by the exercise of reasonable care would discover the condition, and should realize that it involves an unreasonable risk of harm to such invitees, and\n(b) should expect that they will not discover or realize the danger, or will fail to protect themselves against it, and\n(c) fails to exercise reasonable care to protect them against the danger.\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 343 (1965).\n. Section 414. Negligence In Exercising Control Retained By Employer\nOne who entrusts work to an independent contractor, but who retains the control of any part of the work, is subject to liability for physical harm to others for whose safety the employer owes a duty to exercise reasonable care, which is caused by his failure to exercise his control with reasonable care.\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 414 (1965). However, comment (c) limits the imposition of liability:\nIn order for the rule stated in this Section to apply, the employer must have retained at least some degree of control over the manner in which the work is done. It is not enough that he has merely a general right to order the work stopped or resumed, to inspect its progress or to receive reports, to make suggestions or recommendations which need not necessarily be followed, or to prescribe alterations and deviations. Such a general right is usually reserved to employers, but it does not mean that the contractor is controlled as to his methods of work, or as to operative detail. There must be such a retention of a right of supervision that the contractor is not entirely free to do the work in his own way.\nId. (emphasis added).\n. The videotape provided, in relevant part:\nWhile on the job you will also note there are other people visiting the job site. Many of these will be making audits of the safety efforts on your job. They may represent the owner, a governmental agency, the insurance carrier, construction manager, or consultants to the owner. All of these parties are looking after your interests as well as the owner\u2019s. When unsafe conditions are found and suggestions are made for reducing hazards, please keep in mind that the suggestions are made for the benefit of us all.\nPlaintiff\u2019s Appendix, Exh. F, Transcript of Videotape.\n. As discussed above, an owner may be liable for injury resulting from a non-obvious condition absent adequate warning to the independent contractor. Similarly, an owner may be liable if the dangerous condition constitutes a \"special danger\u201d or \"peculiar risk\u201d as described below.\n. We note that Plaintiff does not develop an argument before this Court in response to PTC's argument that the case does not fit within the Peculiar Risk Doctrine, despite the fact that both lower courts found against her. Nonetheless, it remains a significant aspect of PTC\u2019s analysis, as discussed supra at 10 n. 9. In rejecting the application of the doctrine, we draw her argument from her pervious filings included in the certified record.\n. \u00a7 416. Work Dangerous In Absence Of Special Precautions\nOne who employs an independent contractor to do work which the employer should recognize as likely to create during its progress a peculiar risk of physical harm to others unless special precautions are taken, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to them by the failure of the contractor to exercise reasonable care to take such precautions, even though the employer has provided for such precautions in the contract or otherwise.\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 416 (1965) (emphasis added)\n\u00a7 427. Negligence As To Danger Inherent In The Work\nOne who employs an independent contractor to do work involving a special danger to others which the employer knows or has reason to know to be inherent in or normal to the work, or which he contemplates or has reason to contemplate when making the contract, is subject to liability for physical harm caused to such others by the contractor's failure to take reasonable precautions against such danger.\nId. \u00a7 427 (1965) (emphasis added).\n. Plaintiff failed to address the Superior Court's discussion that the fact that tipped the scale in McDonough was the lack of proper lighting, finding that the facts would have not presented a peculiar risk for a driver during a daytime shift, in a case involving substantially more risk than was present on NESL\u2019s haul road. McDonough, 324 A.2d at 547.\n. \u00a7 324A. Liability To Third Person For Negligent Performance Of Undertaking\nOne who undertakes, gratuitously or for consideration, to render services to another which he should recognize as necessary for the protection of a third person or his things, is subject to liability to the third person for physical harm resulting from his failure to exercise reasonable care to protect his undertaking, if\n(a) his failure to exercise reasonable care increases the risk of such harm, or\n(b) he has undertaken to perform a duty owed by the other to the third person, or\n(c) the harm is suffered because of reliance of the other or the third person upon the undertaking.\nRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 324A.\n. The report described the expert\u2019s view of proper actions by construction managers:\nA construction manager must inspect the works on the project on a continuous basis and immediately address any non-compliance with any applicable local, state and federal regulations. As a professional representing the owner, it is the [construction manager's] duty to make sure all applicable safety procedures are followed when construction activities are in progress. It is mandatory that he not only inspect the work being performed but also how it is being done. Although the means and methods of construction are the responsibility of the trade contractor, it does not relieve the [construction manager] of his duties to make sure that such means and methods are safe and will not result in injury or death of anyone on the project.\nExpert Report at 1, Exh. N of Plaintiff\u2019s Appendix. The expert also opined on Trumbull's performance of its contractual duties of inspection:\nThe [construction manager] admits to infrequent inspections. Claims [sic] that the haul road being a temporary structure did not warrant full safety compliance review. He admits to traveling on haul roads and yet fails to notice steep grades, narrow width, faulty super elevation, lack of proper drainage, and the absence of a safety berm. He further pays no attention to hazardous weather conditions specifically on the day of the accident despite concern expressed by many employees.... To state in the depositions that the [construction manager's] role was only to review and approve the contractor\u2019s safety plan proves that the [construction manager] either did not understand the proper role of a Construction Manager, or was guilty or dereliction of his duties, resulting in the unfortunate and wrongful death of [Decedent].\nId. at 2. Plaintiff noted that Trumbull did not present an expert report in opposition.\n. Although not before this Court, we note that the Commonwealth Court found that Plaintiff had sustained her burden in part by presenting evidence of a question of material fact regarding whether Trumbull's conduct was a substantial factor in Decedent's accident.\n. This assertion begs the question concerning whether Trumbull satisfied its obligation to review safety plans by approving a safety plan that did not address haul roads, a standard feature of a highway construction site. That issue is not before this Court, but potentially may arise during trial.\n. Plaintiff also contends that Decedent was an intended beneficiary to the contract. As we find that Plaintiff established Trumbull's duty to perform its contractual duties in a non-negligent manner sufficient to prevent summary judgment, we do not discuss the potential application of the law relating to intended beneficiaries.\n. A five-member court decided the case, with Justices McDermott and Zappala joining Justice Flaherty\u2019s majority opinion while Justice Larsen joined Justice Papadakos\u2019 dissenting opinion. Chief Justice Nix and Justice Stout did not participate in the decision.\n. The inquiry on remand may also call for an examination of the contractual obligations of other parties on the site. See Marshall, 568 A.2d at 936 (\u201d[W]hen construing a contract which by necessary implication refers to another document, the other document may be looked to for evidence of surrounding circumstances in an effort to ascertain the intention of the parties.\u201d)"}
