{"id": "281049", "contents": "OPINION\nNEWMAN, Justice.\nIn this capital case, Josoph Henry (Henry) appeals pursuant to the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9541, et seq. (PCRA), from the Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County (PCRA'Court), which denied his petition for relief. We affirm.\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\nHenry, a student at Lehigh University, burglarized the dormitory room of fellow student Jeanne Ann Clery (Clery) in the early morning hours of April 5, 1986. Clery, who was asleep in the room, was awakened during the burglary. To prevent, her from identifying him, Henry began a brutal assault on Clery. He slashed her neck repeatedly with broken glass, bit her face and breasts, beat her face and body, raped her, sodomized her, and ultimately strangled her to death. Later, he confessed the murder to friends, who informed the police.\nAt trial, privately retained counsel, J. Michael Farrell, Esquire, represented Henry. Henry admitted to the savage attack and murder, and he made an attempt to raise the insanity defense. However, the trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s demurrer and removed that defense from the jury\u2019s consideration. On April 25, 1987, the jury found Henry guilty of first degree murder, rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, indecent assault, burglary, theft, robbery, and aggravated assault. After a penalty hearing, the jury returned a sentence of death. This Court affirmed the judgment of sentence on direct appeal, and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari. Commonwealth v. Henry, 524 Pa. 135, 569 A.2d 929 (1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 931, 111 S.Ct. 1338, 113 L.Ed.2d 269 (1991).\nOn March 27, 1995, shortly before his scheduled execution, Henry filed a petition to stay the execution so that he could seek relief pursuant to the PCRA. The PCRA court granted the stay and appointed Brian Monahan, Esquire, and Dwight Danser, Esquire, of the Northampton County Public Defender\u2019s Office to file a PCRA petition on Henry\u2019s behalf. The court held four days of hearings on the PCRA petition, during which time Henry and the Commonwealth presented several witnesses. By Order dated January 31, 1996, the PCRA court denied Henry\u2019s petition for relief.\nHenry then appealed to this Court. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 722(4) and 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9546(d) (Supreme Court has exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final orders denying post-conviction relief in capital cases). After perfecting his appeal, Henry petitioned this Court to relieve the Northampton County Public Defender\u2019s Office so privately retained counsel, Billy \u00d1olas, Esquire, and his associate Robert B. Dunham, Esquire, both presently with the Center for Legal Education, Advocacy & Defense Assistance, could represent him exclusively. By Order dated December 20, 1996, we granted Henry\u2019s request.\nDISCUSSION\nHenry raises numerous claims for relief, which we are separating into four general categories: PCRA court error, prosecutorial misconduct, trial court error, and ineffective assistance of counsel. We will address his arguments in that order.\nAlleged PCRA Court Error\nHenry claims that he did not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing from the PCRA court. Specifically, he claims that the PCRA court erred in denying his request to call Dr. Dennis Asen and Dr. Isidore Mihalakis as defense witnesses. At trial, Dr. Asen testified as a bite-mark expert for the Commonwealth and Dr. Mihalakis testified as an expert pathologist for the Commonwealth. Henry attempted to call these witnesses at the PCRA hearing to demonstrate that their testimony at trial was \u201cfalse, baseless and misleading,\u201d and should have been \u201cexcluded or devastatingly impeached at trial----\u201d Brief of Appellant at 16. Thus, Henry called these witnesses for the purpose of challenging the admissibility and credibility of their trial testimony. He asks our Court to remand this case to the PCRA court so his counsel can examine Dr. Asen and Dr. Mihalakis. We decline to do so.\nOn direct appeal, this Court reviewed Henry\u2019s claims concerning the admissibility of the disputed testimony and found them to be without merit. Henry, 524 Pa. at 146-47, 151 n. 6, 569 A.2d at 934-35, 937 n. 6. Therefore, Henry\u2019s challenges to the admissibility of the trial testimony of Dr. Asen and Dr. Mihalakis are not cognizable under the PCRA because they were previously litigated. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(3); 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(a)(2). Additionally, to the extent that Henry sought to examine Dr. Asen and Dr. Mihalakis to demonstrate that trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination of these witnesses was ineffective, the PCRA court did not err in precluding the testimony. The admissibility of evidence is vested in the sound discretion of the hearing court and an appellate court may reverse only where there is an abuse of that discretion. Commonwealth v. Claypool, 508 Pa. 198, 495 A.2d 176 (1985). The PCRA court heard four days of testimony and permitted Henry to present many witnesses, including Dr. Norman Sperber, who rebutted the trial testimony of Dr. Asen, and Dr. Jonathan Arden, who rebutted the trial testimony of Dr. Mihalakis. The testimony of Dr. Sperber and Dr. Arden provided the PCRA court with sufficient information to evaluate Henry\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness, and we find no abuse of discretion in the PCRA court\u2019s decision to preclude the examinations of Dr. Asen and Dr. Mihalakis. Claypool.\nHenry next argues that the PCRA court abused its discretion in denying his request for a continuance to present the testimony of his expert psychiatrist, Dr. Alec Whyte. He claims that we should remand this case to the PCRA court so Dr. Whyte can testify. We disagree.\nThe decision to grant or deny a request for a continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion. Commonwealth v. Chambers, 546 Pa. 370, 685 A.2d 96 (1996), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 118 S.Ct. 90, 139 L.Ed.2d 46 (1997); Commonwealth v. Crews, 536 Pa. 508, 640 A.2d 395 (1994). Before seeking a continuance for Dr. Whyte\u2019s testimony, Henry presented the testimony of Dr. Barry Crown, his expert psychologist. Dr. Crown testified extensively concerning Henry\u2019s alleged psychological problems, including difficulties with his birthing process, his childhood experiences, his purported brain damage, the nature of neuropsychological testing, and the lack of such testing by Henry\u2019s defense psychiatrist at trial. Henry then sought a continuance because Dr. Whyte was not available to testify.\nIn denying the continuance, the PCRA court noted that the parties had been aware of the hearing date for quite some time. In fact, our review of the PCRA docket shows that on December 4, 1995, nearly six weeks before the hearing, the PCRA court entered an Order scheduling the hearing for January 16, 1996. The PCRA court also rejected counsel\u2019s claim that inclement weather prohibited Dr. Whyte\u2019s attendance, noting that numerous other witnesses from out-of-state could attend the hearing. Moreover, it does not appear that Dr. Whyte\u2019s testimony would have been significantly different from Dr. Crown\u2019s testimony. Henry\u2019s own counsel characterized Dr. Whyte\u2019s conclusions as \u201csimilar to those of Doctor Crown\u201d, and stated that Dr. Whyte \u201cmay be deemed by the court to be redundant.\u201d Notes of Testimony, January 18, 1996 at 185, 191. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Henry\u2019s request for a continuance and no relief is due. See Commonwealth v. Howard, 466 Pa. 445, 353 A.2d 438 (1976) (a continuance is properly denied where proposed testimony from an absent witness is cumulative or available from another source).\nNext, Henry claims that the PCRA court erred when it permitted former District Attorney Richard Pepper to remain in the courtroom and confer with the prosecution while defense witnesses testified. Pepper was one of the prosecutors for Henry\u2019s trial in 1987. The Commonwealth called Pepper as a fact witness at the PCRA hearing to rebut the testimony of defense witnesses. Henry claims that Pepper\u2019s presence in the courtroom violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, and Pepper should have been sequestered. We disagree.\nRule of Professional Conduct 3.7(a) generally prohibits a lawyer from acting as both advocate and witness in the same trial, and provides as follows:\n(a) A lawyer shall not act as advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness except where:\n(1) the testimony relates to an uncontested issue;\n(2) the testimony relates to the nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or\n(3) disqualification of the lawyer would work substantial hardship on the client.\nRule of Professional Conduct 3.7(a). Contrary to Henry\u2019s assertion, Pepper did not act as an advocate at the PCRA hearing. He did not question witnesses, present evidence, or argue on behalf of the prosecution. Although Pepper conferred with the prosecution during the hearing, Henry provides no authority that bars the prosecution from consulting with its witnesses during a hearing. Thus, this issue is without merit.\nHenry argues that the trial court should have sequestered Pepper while Henry\u2019s fact witnesses were testifying. The purpose of sequestration is to prevent a witness from shaping his testimony with evidence presented by other witnesses. Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 510 Pa. 603, 511 A.2d 764 (1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 951, 107 S.Ct. 1617, 94 L.Ed.2d 801 (1987). However,\n[i]n nearly every criminal case, one side or the other would like to have some or all of the witnesses of his opponent sequestered. The lack of adequate room space, the long delays which would inevitably be caused by sequestration and other practical considerations, make sequestration of witnesses ordinarily impractical or inadvisable, except in unusual circumstances. For the foregoing reasons the question of sequestration of witnesses is left largely to the discretion of the trial Judge and his decision thereon will be reversed only for a clear abuse of discretion.\nCommonwealth v. Kravitz, 400 Pa. 198, 217-18, 161 A.2d 861, 870 (1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 846, 81 S.Ct. 807, 5 L.Ed.2d 811 (1961) (footnote omitted). A request for sequestration of a witness should be specific and should be supported by a showing that the interests of justice require it. Kravitz.\nHere, Henry fails to cite instances in the record where Pepper may arguably have tailored his testimony. He also fails to explain how the PCRA court\u2019s denial of his request for sequestration contravened the interests of justice. This claim warrants no further review.\nProsecutorial Misconduct\nNext, Henry argues that the Commonwealth\u2019s experts, Dr. Asen and Dr. Mihalakis provided \u201cfalse and misleading\u201d testimony at trial. He claims this testimony violated his right to due process. In support of his claim, he cites numerous cases where the United States Supreme Court has held that a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s due process clause occurs when a state obtains a criminal conviction through the knowing use of false evidence. Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972) (prosecution falsely claimed that it did not offer a witness leniency for his testimony); Miller v. Pate, 386 U.S. 1, 87 S.Ct. 785, 17 L.Ed.2d 690 (1967) (prosecution knowingly presented an expert who falsely identified paint on shorts as blood); Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959) (prosecution failed to correct witness\u2019 false testimony that he had not been offered leniency for his testimony); Alcorta v. Texas, 355 U.S. 28, 78 S.Ct. 103, 2 L.Ed.2d 9 (1957) (prosecution knowingly elicited false testimony from a witness); Pyle v. Kansas, 317 U.S. 213, 63 S.Ct. 177, 87 L.Ed. 214 (1942) (prosecution knowingly presented perjured testimony); Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935) (prosecution knowingly presented perjured testimony).\nThe present case, however, does not involve the knowing use of false evidence. The foundation for Henry\u2019s claim that the Commonwealth presented false evidence is the testimony of his experts, Dr. Arden and Dr. Sperber, at the PCRA hearing. These experts disputed the validity of the scientific theories on which Dr. Asen and Dr. Mihalakis based their testimony. Simply because Henry\u2019s experts disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s experts does not mean that the Commonwealth knowingly presented false evidence in violation of Henry\u2019s due process rights. This claim warrants no relief.\nIn a similar vein, Henry claims the Commonwealth knowingly presented false testimony at trial through Marvin Brunson, who was Henry\u2019s cellmate in prison. At trial, Brunson testified for the Commonwealth that Henry confessed to burglarizing Clery\u2019s dormitory room, assaulting her, and strangling her to death. However, in an affidavit attached to Henry\u2019s PCRA petition, Brunson recanted his trial testimony. On direct examination at the PCRA hearing, Brunson testified that he fabricated the account of Brunson\u2019s confession because he expected to receive leniency from the Commonwealth for charges pending against him. Henry now claims that Brunson\u2019s recantation demonstrates that the Commonwealth violated his due process rights by knowingly presenting false testimony at trial.\nRecantation testimony is extremely unreliable. Commonwealth v. McCracken, 540 Pa. 541, 659 A.2d 541 (1995); Commonwealth v. Nelson, 484 Pa. 11, 398 A.2d 636 (1979); Commonwealth v. Coleman, 438 Pa. 373, 264 A.2d 649 (1970). When the recantation involves an admission of perjury, it is the least reliable form of proof. Coleman. The trial court has the responsibility of judging the credibility of the recantation. Nelson. Unless the trial court is satisfied that the recantation is true, it should deny a new trial. Nelson; Coleman. An appellate court may not disturb the trial court\u2019s determination absent a clear abuse of discretion. Nelson.\nIn the present case, the PCRA court found Brunson\u2019s recantation to be equivocal and incredible. The court explained that \u201cBrunson stated that some of his trial testimony had been true, and some false. He appeared to have difficulty discerning which part of his testimony was false.\u201d PCRA court slip op. at 70-71. The PCRA court concluded that, \u201chaving heard Brunson at the PCRA hearing, [the court] cannot find his hearing testimony to be credible.\u201d Id. at 84. Based on the record before us, we find no abuse of discretion in the PCRA court\u2019s credibility determination. Nelson. Because Brunson\u2019s recantation was not credible, Henry\u2019s due process claim fails.\nHenry claims that the Commonwealth violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel when Brunson, allegedly acting as an agent of the Commonwealth, solicited information from him while they were incarcerated together. He relies on Massiah v. United States, 377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964) and its progeny, which prohibit the government from deliberately eliciting incriminating statements from an accused after his Sixth Amendment right to counsel has attached. See Kuhlmann v. Wilson, 477 U.S. 436, 106 S.Ct. 2616, 91 L.Ed.2d 364 (1986); Maine v. Moulton, 474 U.S. 159, 106 S.Ct. 477, 88 L.Ed.2d 481 (1985); United States v. Henry, 447 U.S. 264, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980); Commonwealth v. Moose, 529 Pa. 218, 602 A.2d 1265 (1992).\nHenry first raised this claim in a pre-trial motion to suppress his statements. At a hearing on the motion, Brunson denied that the police instructed him to elicit incriminating statements from Henry. The suppression court subsequently denied Henry\u2019s motion. Henry raised this issue again in post-trial motions, which the trial court denied. On direct appeal, this Court rejected Henry\u2019s claim based on the trial court\u2019s opinion. Henry, 524 Pa. at 147 n. 3, 569 A.2d at 935 n. 3. To avoid the bar of previous litigation, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(3), Henry relies on Brunson\u2019s recantation testimony before the PCRA court where Brunson alleged that police told him to \u201cpump\u201d Henry for information about the murder. However, as previously discussed, the PCRA court found Brunson\u2019s recantation to be unreliable. Accordingly, Henry\u2019s Massiah claim is without merit.\nTrial Court Error\nHenry argues that the trial court erred when it excluded evidence concerning a videotape of an electroencephalogram (EEG) neurological test showing Henry\u2019s reaction to the ingestion of alcohol; the testimony of a professor and a director of prison religious activities; Henry\u2019s family medical records; Henry\u2019s high school and college records; and Henry\u2019s father\u2019s history of psychotic and violent reaction to alcohol. Henry acknowledges that this Court addressed and denied these very same claims on direct appeal. See Henry, 524 Pa. at 150-51, 569 A.2d at 936. Nonetheless, he asks for \u201creconsideration\u201d of the direct appeal decision. Contrary to Henry\u2019s understanding, \u201cthe purpose of the PCRA is not to provide a defendant with a means of relitigating the merits of issues long since decided on direct appeal.\u201d Commonwealth v. Buehl, 540 Pa. 493, 500, 658 A.2d 771, 775 (1995). Because Henry\u2019s claims have been previously litigated, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(a)(2), they are not cognizable under the PCRA, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(3), and we will not address them again.\nHenry claims the trial court erred in refusing his request to instruct the jury that a sentence of life imprisonment means life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. At the time of Henry\u2019s trial in 1987, the law of this Commonwealth prohibited a trial court from giving the jury such an instruction. See Commonwealth v. Strong, 522 Pa. 445, 563 A.2d 479 (1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1060, 110 S.Ct. 1536, 108 L.Ed.2d 775 (1990) (citing Commonwealth v. Johnson, 368 Pa. 139, 81 A.2d 569 (1951)). Therefore, when Henry raised this claim on direct appeal, we rejected it based on Strong. Henry, 524 Pa. at 160, 569 A.2d at 941. After Henry\u2019s direct appeal, the United States Supreme Court issued Simmons v. South Carolina, 512 U.S. 154, 114 S.Ct. 2187, 129 L.Ed.2d 133 (1994). In Simmons, a plurality of the Court held that where the defendant\u2019s future dangerousness is at issue and the defendant makes a specific request, the jury must be informed what the term \u201clife sentence\u201d means. However, in Commonwealth v. Christy, 540 Pa. 192, 656 A.2d 877 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 872, 116 S.Ct. 194, 133 L.Ed.2d 130 (1995), this Court held that Simmons announced a new rule of law, and therefore, shall not be applied retroactively to a case that has exhausted its direct appeal but is pending in a collateral proceeding. See also Commonwealth v. Szuchon, 548 Pa. 37, 693 A.2d 959, cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 224, 139 L.Ed.2d 157 (1997) (Simmons cannot apply retroactively to afford PCRA relief); but see Banks v. Horn, 928 F.Supp. 512 (M.D.Pa.1996) (Simmons may apply retroactively). Recently, the Supreme Court addressed the retroactivity of Simmons in the context of a federal habeas claim and concluded that, because Simmons announced a new rule, it is \u201cinapplicable to an already final death sentence.\u201d O\u2019Dell v. Netherlands \u2014 U.S. -, -, 117 S.Ct. 1969, 1971, 138 L.Ed.2d 351 (1997). Here, Henry\u2019s death sentence had been final for more than four years when Simmons was decided. Accordingly, Simmons is inapplicable to the present PCRA proceeding. O\u2019Dell; Christy.\nIneffective Assistance of Counsel\nHenry alleges several instances of ineffective assistance of counsel throughout this case. Under the PCRA, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel provides a basis for relief only when it \u201cso undermined the truth-determining process that no reliable adjudication of guilt or innocence could have taken place.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(2)(h). To establish such a claim, a defendant must demonstrate that (1) the underlying claim is of arguable merit, (2) counsel had no reasonable basis for the act or omission in question, and (3) but for counsel\u2019s act or omission, the outcome of the proceedings would have been different. Commonwealth v. Douglas, 537 Pa. 588, 645 A.2d 226 (1994) (citing Commonwealth v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 527 A.2d 973 (1987)). We presume that counsel was effective and the defendant has the burden of proving otherwise. Commonwealth v. Marshall, 534 Pa. 488, 633 A.2d 1100 (1993). Counsel cannot be considered ineffective for failing to raise a meritless claim. Commonwealth v. Peterkin, 538 Pa. 455, 649 A.2d 121 (1994), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1137, 115 S.Ct. 2569, 132 L.Ed.2d 821 (1995). Additionally, a defendant cannot obtain post-conviction review of previously litigated claims by alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and presenting new theories of relief. Id.\nHenry claims that trial counsel was ineffective during voir dire in failing to properly question prospective jurors. Specifically, he argues that counsel did not investigate the potential racial bias against his client, a black male charged with killing a white female. In support of his argument, Henry relies on Turner v. Murray, 476 U.S. 28, 106 S.Ct. 1683, 90 L.Ed.2d 27 (1986), where the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant accused of an interracial crime is entitled to have prospective jurors informed of the race of the victim and questioned on the issue of racial bias. See also Commonwealth v. Glaspy, 532 Pa. 572, 616 A.2d 1359 (1992) (trial court abused its discretion by precluding defense counsel from questioning prospective jurors on racial bias); Commonwealth v. Terry, 513 Pa. 381, 521 A.2d 398, cert. denied, 482 U.S. 920, 107 S.Ct. 3198, 96 L.Ed.2d 685 (1987) (Turner requires voir dire on racial bias in interracial capital murder case); Commonwealth v. Christian, 480 Pa. 131, 389 A.2d 545 (1978) (reversible error for trial court to refuse defendant\u2019s inquiry concerning racial bias on voir dire in interracial murder case); Commonwealth v. Segers, 460 Pa. 149, 331 A.2d 462 (1975) (in certain circumstances, a defendant has the right to ask about possible racial bias of potential jurors).\nContrary to Henry\u2019s assertion, counsel\u2019s decision did not amount to ineffective assistance. The Turner Court specifically noted that the decision to request voir dire on the subject of racial prejudice is reserved for defense counsel. This Court has recognized that there may be legitimate reasons for not pursuing the issue of racial bias in every interracial crime. In Commonwealth v. Richardson, 504 Pa. 358, 473 A.2d 1361 (1984), we explained that raising the issue of racial bias may have the adverse effect of emphasizing racial stereotypes by focusing the jurors\u2019 attentions on skin color instead of the guilt or innocence of the accused. See also Commonwealth v. Griffin, 537 Pa. 447, 644 A.2d 1167 (1994) (counsel had a reasonable basis for not pursuing questions of racial bias during voir dire even though one juror volunteered his prejudice against blacks).\nIn this case, trial counsel testified at the PCRA hearing that he remembered questioning some prospective jurors concerning racial bias. Although he could not recall why he did not question all of the prospective jurors on racial bias, at the time of trial, he believed that the jurors he selected were acceptable for his client\u2019s case. Our review of the record indicates that of the twelve jurors seated on the jury, three were asked race-related questions. The remaining nine were not asked such question but were acceptable for various other reasons, including their willingness to entertain evidence concerning an insanity defense, the effects of alcohol consumption, and psychiatric issues; and their ability to presume Henry innocent and return a life sentence if the evidence warranted. Therefore, we cannot say that counsel pursued an unreasonable course during voir dire. Additionally, Henry has not proved that, but for counsel\u2019s tactics, the outcome of his trial would have been different. He does not allege that a racially biased juror was seated or that racial bias entered into the jury\u2019s deliberations. This Court reviewed the record on direct appeal pursuant to our statutory duty and found \u201cno basis for belief that the sentence of death was the \u2018product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\u2019 \u201d Henry, 524 Pa. at 161, 569 A.2d at 941-42 (quoting 42 Pa.C.S \u00a7 9711(h)(3)(i)). Accordingly, we find no merit in Henry\u2019s' claim that his trial counsel was ineffective. Douglas.\nNext, Henry argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to adequately examine certain prospective jurors concerning their possible prejudices against the defense of insanity. The record belies Henry\u2019s underlying claim. Counsel specifically asked ten of the twelve jurors their opinions concerning the defense of insanity. Counsel asked the remaining two jurors their opinions concerning psychiatrists and psychiatric testimony. Moreover, even if counsel had failed to examine prospective jurors on this issue, Henry fails to articulate how such an omission would have prejudiced him when the trial court removed the defense of insanity from the jury\u2019s consideration. Thus, we find Henry\u2019s ineffectiveness claim devoid of merit.\nHenry asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to life-quaiify the jury properly. The term \u201clife-qualify\u201d refers to the process in which counsel identifies and excludes those prospective jurors who would be unable to consider a sentence of life imprisonment for a conviction of first degree murder. See Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992). In Morgan, the United States Supreme Court held that a defendant is entitled to life-qualify a jury if he so chooses. However, this Court has repeatedly held that counsel is not rendered ineffective for failing to life-qualify a jury. Commonwealth v. Lark, 548 Pa. 441, 698 A.2d 43 (1997); Commonwealth v. Morris, 546 Pa. 296, 684 A.2d 1037 (1996), cert. denied, - U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 2484, 138 L.Ed.2d 992 (1997); Commonwealth v. Blount, 538 Pa. 156, 647 A.2d 199 (1994); Commonwealth v. Jermyn, 516 Pa. 460, 533 A.2d 74 (1987). As we stated in Jermyn,\nThe mere fact that counsel may not have posed the specific question as to whether a prospective juror would vote for a sentence of life imprisonment in an appropriate case does not justify the conclusion that counsel failed to assure that a fair and impartial jury was selected. Such a talismanic requirement would clearly place form above substance.\nId. at 488, 533 A.2d at 87.\nOur review of the record reveals that trial counsel did life-qualify eleven of the twelve jurors seated for Henry\u2019s trial. Although the remaining juror was not specifically life-qualified, she said that she could be fair and impartial and would follow the court\u2019s instructions. N.T. April 9, 1987 at 225-26. Henry\u2019s claim that counsel failed to obtain a fair and impartial jury is groundless. See Commonwealth v. Cox, 546 Pa. 515, 686 A.2d 1279 (1996), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 567, 139 L.Ed.2d 407 (1997), (counsel was not ineffective for failing to life-qualify jurors where jurors assured the court that they would follow the law and the court\u2019s instructions).\nHenry alleges that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to question jurors during voir dire after he learned that some prospective jurors were discussing the case while in the jury waiting room. He claims that counsel\u2019s nonfeasance created an unacceptable risk of prejudice. We disagree.\nIn Commonwealth v. Tressler, 526 Pa. 139, 584 A.2d 930 (1990), we held that trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue an analogous claim. Following the defendant\u2019s trial in Tressler, his counsel learned from an alternate juror that some jurors had expressed their belief that the defendant was guilty before the trial had begun. This Court held that the jurors\u2019 initial opinions before being sworn, before hearing any evidence, and before receiving instructions did not deprive the defendant of a fair and impartial jury. Thus, we concluded that trial counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to seek a new trial based on this unmeritorious issue.\nIn the present case, Henry does not describe the nature of the alleged discussion between prospective jurors other than to say that the \u201cprospective jurors were talking among themselves about the case while in the jury waiting room.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 83. This alleged, nondescript conversation \u201cabout the case\u201d presents much less of a threat to Henry\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury than the express preconception of guilt that we rejected as a basis for relief in Tressler. Furthermore, the trial court instructed the jury here that the presumption of innocence operates \u201cto make sure that no decision is based on an initial suspicion, initial wondering\u201d and to \u201cget that all out, get that all out of the way.\u201d N.T. April 15, 1987 at 16. We find no merit in Henry\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue this issue.\nHenry makes several claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the Commonwealth committed various discovery violations and trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise these violations with the trial court. Although inartfully constructed, Henry\u2019s arguments appear to seek relief separately for both the discovery violations and counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in failing to raise them. Any arguments based on the alleged discovery violations alone, however, are waived because Henry failed to raise the issues before the trial court. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(b). Therefore, we will only address Henry\u2019s ineffectiveness claims.\nFirst, Henry argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to assert at trial that the Commonwealth violated its discovery obligations by failing to disclose the expert opinion of Dr. Asen concerning the classification of bite-marks. Prior to trial, Dr. Asen prepared a report regarding the identification of the bite-marks on Clery\u2019s body. Dr. Asen testified at trial concerning bite-mark identification and classification. Specifically, Dr. Asen testified that bite-marks could be classified as attacking, sadistic or sexual, and in his opinion the bite-marks on Clery were attacking or sadistic.\nInitially, we note that Henry admitted causing the bite-marks on Clery\u2019s body. Furthermore, trial counsel filed a motion in limine to exclude Dr. Asen\u2019s testimony, which the trial court denied. At trial, counsel renewed his objection to Dr. Asen\u2019s testimony, and the trial court again rejected the claim. On direct appeal, Henry challenged the admissibility of Dr. Asen\u2019s bite-mark classification testimony on the basis that there is no generally accepted scientific procedure for classifying bite-marks. We rejected Henry\u2019s claim \u201c[sjince Dr. Asen was established as a practicing dentist who had specialized knowledge of bite mark identification, and since the jury was clearly informed of its right to accept or reject Dr. Asen\u2019s testimony____\u201d Henry, 524 Pa. at 147, 569 A.2d at 934-35. Having lost the battle to exclude Dr. Asen\u2019s testimony on the grounds of scientific reliability, Henry now seeks to challenge the testimony based on counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s purported discovery violations.\nPennsylvania Rule of Criminal Procedure 305 governs pretrial discovery and provides in relevant part as follows:\n(B) Disclosure by the Commonwealth.\n(1) Mandatory. In all court cases, on request by the defendant, and subject to any protective order which the Commonwealth might obtain under this rule, the Commonwealth shall disclose to the defendant\u2019s attorney all of the following requested items or information, provided they are material to the instant case. The Commonwealth shall, when applicable, permit the defendant\u2019s attorney to inspect and copy or photograph such items.\n(e) any results or reports of scientific tests, expert opinions, and written or recorded reports of polygraph examinations or other physical or mental examinations of the defendant, which are within the possession or control of the attorney for the Commonwealth;\n(E) Remedy. If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule, the court may order such party to permit discovery or inspection, may grant a continuance, or may prohibit such party from introducing evidence not disclosed, other than testimony of the defendant, or it may enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances.\nPa.R.Crim.P. 305. In his brief to this Court, Henry admits that the Commonwealth provided him with a copy of Dr. Asen\u2019s report during pre-trial discovery proceedings. Thus, the Commonwealth has not violated the disclosure requirements of Rule 305.\nHenry argues that Dr. Asen\u2019s testimony at trial concerning the classification of bite-marks went beyond the scope of his expert report, and trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the testimony on that basis. Even assuming arguendo that Dr. Asen\u2019s testimony went beyond the scope of his report, Henry has failed to show that he suffered prejudice. As the PCRA court aptly explained,\nwith or without Dr. Asen\u2019s testimony, a logical inference flows that the bites Henry inflicted were consistent with an intent to cause pain\u2014rather than not to cause pain. It would be ludicrous, on these facts, to suggest that the bites were willingly received, and no one has offered any testimony suggesting that the perpetrator did not intend to cause pain. It was for the jury, on the record presented, accepting, ignoring, or rejecting Dr. Asen\u2019s testimony, to reach a conclusion as to whether the bites were intended to cause pain. Whether Henry\u2019s act fits into a sadistic or sexual mode, or otherwise, it is his intent to inflict pain which is the driving demarcation of conduct which aggravates a set of facts to a level of torture.\nPCRA court slip. op. at 33 (citation omitted). Because Henry has failed to demonstrate prejudice from Dr. Asen\u2019s testimony, we find no merit in Henry\u2019s claim of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness.\nHenry further alleges that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to cross-examine Dr. Asen adequately regarding his bite-mark classification testimony. Henry claims that with proper cross-examination and/or the use of rebuttal witnesses, counsel could have discredited Dr. Asen. However, as previously discussed, Dr. Asen\u2019s testimony did not prejudice Henry within the meaning of the PCRA. Therefore, even if counsel was deficient in his attempt to discredit Dr. Asen, Henry is not entitled to relief because he suffered no prejudice from Dr. Asen\u2019s testimony. See Commonwealth v. Yarris, 519 Pa. 571, 549 A.2d 513 (1988) (defendant has the burden of proving prejudice from defense counsel\u2019s response to prosecution\u2019s scientific evidence).\nNext, Henry argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object when the Commonwealth\u2019s expert, Dr. Mihalakis, testified that scrape marks on Clery\u2019s neck were consistent with someone being held \u201chostage\u201d or \u201cat bay\u201d. Henry claims that counsel should have sought to preclude the testimony based on the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged violation of Rule 305. We find no merit in this claim.\nPreliminarily, we note that Henry admitted inflicting the wounds found on Clery\u2019s body, and thus, Dr. Mihalakis\u2019 testimony was merely a characterization of an uncontested fact. On direct appeal, Henry challenged the admissibility of Dr. Mihalakis\u2019 testimony on the absence of a scientific foundation and this Court rejected the claim. Henry, 524 Pa. at 147 n. 3, 569 A.2d at 935 n. 3.\nHenry now raises counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to challenge the testimony on the basis of the Commonwealth\u2019s discovery violations. Henry admits, however, that the Commonwealth provided him with a copy of Dr. Mihalakis\u2019s expert report before trial. Thus, there has been no violation of Rule 305. Henry argues that Dr. Mihalakis\u2019 trial testimony concerning the \u201chostage\u201d or \u201cat bay\u201d situation went beyond the scope of his expert report, and therefore, counsel should have objected on this basis. Assuming, arguendo, that the testimony exceeded the scope of the report, Henry has failed to show prejudice from the admission of the testimony. In addressing this issue, the PCRA court stated the following:\n[T]he overwhelming evidence discloses that Henry, while burglarizing the victim\u2019s college dormitory room, bit, beat, cut, raped, sodomized and strangled the victim, ultimately to keep her quiet from exposing his felonious conduct. The existence of this evidence challenges any contention that Dr. Mihalakis\u2019s conclusions, whether or not based on scientific principle, was necessary to lead the jury to a guilty verdict and later a finding of the aggravating circumstance of torture.\nThe court questions what difference a jury would find if a victim of such an atrocious assault was able to resist; or whether the perpetrator holds his victim \u201cat bay\u201d or as \u201chostage\u201d for a period of time____\n... On this record, the presence or absence of Dr. Mihalakis\u2019s testimony could hardly affect the jury\u2019s finding that Henry specifically intended to kill the victim.\nPCRA court slip. op. at 29. We agree with the PCRA court, and accordingly, we find no merit in Henry\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness.\nHenry asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to cross-examine Dr. Mihalakis adequately concerning his \u201chostage\u201d or \u201cat bay\u201d testimony and for failing to present an expert witness to rebut Dr. Mihalakis\u2019 testimony. Assuming, arguendo, that counsel\u2019s cross-examination was deficient and that with reasonable diligence counsel could have obtained an expert who would have rebutted Dr. Mihalakis\u2019 testimony, Henry is still not entitled to relief because, as discussed above, he has not shown that Dr. Mihalakis\u2019 testimony prejudiced him. Without a showing of prejudice, trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for his response to the prosecution\u2019s scientific evidence. Yanis.\nHenry asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to testimony by Dr. Mihalakis, Criminalist Thomas Jensen and Coroner Joseph Reichel that the scratch marks on Clery\u2019s neck were inflicted with a piece of glass. Through preliminary hearing testimony and pre-trial reports, the Commonwealth had advanced the hypothesis that Henry inflicted the scratch marks with a slightly misshapen Slinky that the police found in Clery\u2019s dorm room following the murder. The Commonwealth changed its theory after Marvin Brunson relayed Henry\u2019s confession, in which Henry told Brunson that he used a piece of glass to inflict the cuts on Clery\u2019s neck. Henry now argues that trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to the testimony of Dr. Mihalakis, Criminalist Jensen and Coroner Reichel based on the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged violation of Rule 305 for failing to update its pre-trial reports.\nAssuming arguendo that the Commonwealth violated the rules of discovery, we again fail to see how trial counsel\u2019s lack of an objection prejudiced Henry. Henry admitted that he inflicted the wounds on Clery\u2019s neck. Whether he did so with a Slinky, a piece of glass, or another object is of no moment. Because Henry has failed to demonstrate prejudice, we find no merit in his claim of ineffective assistance. Commonwealth v. Jones, 546 Pa. 161, 683 A.2d 1181 (1996) (a court need not address the first two prongs of the ineffectiveness standard if the defendant fails to meet the prejudice prong).\nFurther, Henry alleges that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain discovery from the Commonwealth concerning its expert psychiatrist, Dr. Kenneth Kool, and its expert psychologist, Mr. Albert Levitt. Dr. Kool and Mr. Levitt testified at trial in rebuttal to Henry\u2019s psychiatric expert, Dr. John O\u2019Brien. Henry claims that counsel\u2019s failure to obtain discovery concerning Dr. Kool and Mr. Levitt left Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony open to criticism by Dr. Kool and Mr. Levitt. Although trial counsel did not obtain discovery concerning Dr. Kool and Mr. Levitt, Henry\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness nevertheless fails when evaluated under the unique circumstances of this case.\nBefore trial, counsel filed a notice of his intent to pursue an insanity defense. In preparing that defense, however, counsel encountered difficulty finding an expert witness who would testify that Henry was insane. Counsel consulted Dr. Robert Sadoff, a well-known forensic psychiatrist. After evaluating Henry, however, Dr. Sadoff informed counsel that Henry was not insane within the meaning of the M\u2019Naghten standard at the time he killed Clery. Counsel also consulted with Dr. Gerald Cooke, a noted forensic psychologist. After meeting with Henry, Dr. Cooke similarly concluded that Henry was not insane under the M\u2019Naghten standard. Shortly before trial, counsel was able to obtain a report from Dr. John O\u2019Brien, a psychiatrist, who evaluated Henry and concluded that Henry was insane under the M\u2019Naghten standard. However, because of the delay in obtaining Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s report, counsel was unable to comply with the trial court\u2019s discovery deadline for supplying expert reports. Despite this violation, the court permitted Henry to present Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony in the interest of justice.\nAfter Dr. O\u2019Brien testified, the court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s demurrer to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Henry\u2019s insanity defense, thereby removing the defense of insanity from, the jury\u2019s consideration. The court did permit the jury to consider Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony insofar as it concerned Henry\u2019s ability to form the specific intent required for first degree murder. In response, the Commonwealth sought to present the testimony of Dr. Kool and Mr. Levitt to rebut the testimony of Dr. O\u2019Brien. Trial counsel objected on the basis that Henry had not received reports from these experts in compliance with the court\u2019s discovery schedule. In overruling the objection, the court stated:\nSince I have made rulings that the defense did not comply with the Court\u2019s order, that despite such violations the interest of justice required me to permit the defense to proceed, I can\u2019t very well hold the Commonwealth responsible for not having furnished responses to discovery or determine [discovery] was incomplete. I think we have gotten to the point where I am going to exercise the same latitude I did on [the defendant\u2019s] side of the case and permit the Commonwealth to elicit this testimony even though it was not furnished during the pretrial discovery stages because the pretrial discovery stages remained incomplete at the time of the trial for reasons that the defendant also contributed to.\nN.T. April 24, 1987 at 100.\nOn the facts of this case, we find no ineffectiveness in trial counsel\u2019s stewardship in pursuing an insanity defense. First, we note that the delay in obtaining an expert willing to support Henry\u2019s insanity defense was not due to counsel\u2019s indolence. To the contrary, counsel timely consulted two well-recognized experts, neither of whom found Henry insane. We cannot fault counsel simply because the experts he retained did not reach the conclusions his client wanted. Even though counsel obtained Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s services after the court\u2019s discovery deadline, Henry suffered no prejudice from the discovery violation because the trial court permitted Dr. O\u2019Brien to testify. Moreover, though counsel did not have the benefit of expert reports from Dr. Kool and Mr. Levitt to aid his presentation of Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony concerning Henry\u2019s ability to form a specific intent to kill, counsel was able to cross-examine both of these witnesses effectively. Considering the difficulty counsel faced in obtaining an expert to testify favorably for his client, we conclude that counsel provided effective assistance under the circumstances here.\nIn his next claim, Henry contends that the prosecutor improperly injected racial prejudice into the trial by suggesting that Henry was racially motivated in killing Clery and trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence to rebut the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion. On direct appeal, Henry challenged the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the killing was racially motivated. This Court rejected Henry\u2019s claim because the prosecutor\u2019s statements were based on evidence in the record. Henry, 524 Pa. at 158, 569 A.2d at 940. Thus, to the extent Henry is seeking relief based solely on the prosecutor\u2019s statements, his claim has been previously litigated. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(a)(2).\nTo the extent that Henry is seeking relief for counsel\u2019s failure to rebut the prosecution\u2019s allegation of racial motivation, his claim is without merit. Henry argues that trial counsel should have presented testimony at trial from Henry\u2019s mother, Marie Henry, and Henry\u2019s friend, Robert Crawford, who both testified at the PCRA hearing that Henry was not biased against white people. In order to establish that counsel was ineffective for failing to call a witness, a defendant must show, in addition to meeting the general standard for an ineffectiveness claim, the following elements: (1) the witness existed; (2) the witness was available to testify for the defense; (3) counsel knew of or should have known of the existence of the witness; (4) the witness was willing to testify for the defense; and (5) the absence of the witness\u2019 testimony was so prejudicial as to have denied the defendant a fair trial. Commonwealth v. Smith, 544 Pa. 219, 675 A.2d 1221 (1996), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 1090, 137 L.Ed.2d 223 (1997); Commonwealth v. Speight, 544 Pa. 451, 677 A.2d 317 (1996), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 967, 136 L.Ed.2d 852 (1997). Henry, however, has not addressed this five-pronged test in his brief. This claim warrants no further review.\nHenry claims that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. Specifically, Henry argues that the following actions by the prosecutor were improper: (1) using a timer to measure a four minute period of silence, which is the amount of time the Commonwealth claimed that it took Henry to strangle Clery; (2) commenting that the gap in this case was between Henry\u2019s front teeth and filled with Clery\u2019s flesh; (3) stating that Henry looked into Clery\u2019s eyes as she died; (4) asserting that Clery begged for her life during the four minutes it took Henry to strangle her; and (5) referring to Henry\u2019s defense of alcohol idiosyncratic intoxication as \u201cridiculous\u201d. We find no merit in Henry\u2019s claims.\nOur Court recently set forth the standard of review for claims of prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument as follows:\nThe standard for reviewing such claims is well settled. Generally, a prosecutor\u2019s arguments to the jury are not a basis for the granting of a new trial unless the unavoidable effect of such comments would be to prejudice the jury, forming in their minds fixed bias and hostility towards the accused which would prevent them from properly weighing the evidence and rendering a true verdict. Moreover, the prosecution, similar to the defense, is accorded reasonable latitude and may employ oratorical flair arguing its version of the case to the jury. The arguments advanced must, however, be based upon matters in evidence and/or upon any legitimate inferences that can be drawn therefrom. Finally, any allegedly improper prosecutorial comments must also be examined within the context of the conduct of defense counsel.\nJones, 546 Pa. at 199, 683 A.2d at 1199-1200 (1996) (citations omitted).\nThis Court addressed Henry\u2019s claim concerning the prosecutor\u2019s four minute simulation on direct appeal and found it to be without merit. Henry, 524 Pa. at 151 n. 6, 569 A.2d at 937 n. 6. Accordingly, that claim has been previously litigated, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9544(a)(2), and will not be addressed again.\nThe prosecutor\u2019s reference to the gap in Henry\u2019s teeth being filled with Clery\u2019s flesh was a fair comment on the evidence of record. The Commonwealth introduced a mold of Henry\u2019s teeth at trial, which matched the bite-marks on Clery\u2019s body and showed a discernable gap between two of his front teeth. Henry admitted that he was the person who inflicted the bites on Clery\u2019s body. Because the prosecutor\u2019s comments were properly based on the evidence, counsel had no basis for an objection. Counsel will never be deemed ineffective for failing to raise a meritless claim. Peterkin.\nSimilarly, the prosecutor\u2019s statements that Henry looked into Clery\u2019s eyes as she died and that Clery begged for her life were legitimate inferences drawn from the evidence at trial. Henry\u2019s attack on Clery was unmercifully violent. He bit her face and breasts, beat her face and body, sliced her neck with a piece of glass, raped her, sodomized her, and strangled her to death with his hands. It is not unreasonable to suggest that during the course of this attack Clery implored Henry to stop or that Henry looked into her eyes as he manually strangled her. Considering the undisputed brutality of the assault, which numerous Commonwealth witnesses described during trial, we do not believe the prosecutor\u2019s comments in closing argument would have had the unavoidable effect of preventing the jury from rendering a true verdict based on the evidence. Jones. Henry\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective for failing to object must fail.\nFinally, counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of alcohol idiosyncratic intoxication as \u201cridiculous\u201d does not warrant a new trial. A prosecutor should refrain from offering his or her opinion of the truth or falsity of the evidence presented by the accused. Peterkin. However, \u201c[e]ven where the language of the prosecutor is intemperate, uncalled for and improper, a new trial is not necessarily required.\u201d Commonwealth v. Meadows, 534 Pa. 450, 465, 633 A.2d 1081, 1089 (1993). The prosecutor\u2019s comments must be evaluated in context. Jones. Here, the prosecutor was trying to discredit Henry\u2019s claim that he was suffering from alcohol idiosyncratic intoxication at the time of the murder. The prosecutor described how none of Henry\u2019s friends noticed any impairment in his faculties shortly before the murder; he was sufficiently coherent to burglarize Cilery\u2019s dorm room and consciously decide to kill her when she awoke; another friend whom he visited after the murder did not detect any sign of intoxication; and he played basketball well a few hours later. During the course of this commentary, the prosecutor referred to \u201cthis ridiculous alcohol idiosyncratic intoxication\u201d and \u201cthis ridiculous disease\u201d. These comments do not require a new trial.\nIn Commonwealth v. Faulkner, 528 Pa. 57, 595 A.2d 28 (1991), cert. denied, 503 U.S. 989, 112 S.Ct. 1680, 118 L.Ed.2d 397 (1992), the prosecutor called defense counsel \u201cstupid\u201d and described counsel\u2019s conduct as \u201coutrageous\u201d. We held that these disparaging comments did not prejudice the jury. In Commonwealth v. Brawner, 381 Pa.Super. 265, 553 A.2d 458, appeal denied, 522 Pa. 617, 563 A.2d 886 (1989), the Superior Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s comments that the defendant\u2019s alibi \u201csmells to high heaven\u201d, is \u201crotten\u201d, \u201cstinks\u201d, and is \u201cobvious\u201d did not warrant a new trial because they were not so egregious as to render the jury incapable of delivering a true verdict. Similarly, the prosecutor\u2019s references here to Henry\u2019s alleged alcohol idiosyncratic intoxication as \u201cridiculous\u201d would not have formed in the minds of the jury a fixed bias and hostility toward Henry that would have prevented them from weighing the evidence objectively and rendering a true verdict. Therefore, we find no merit in Henry\u2019s allegation of counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness for failing to object.\nHenry argues that trial counsel provided ineffective assistance during the penalty phase, and based on that ineffectiveness he is entitled to relief. Specifically, he claims that counsel ineffectively failed to present a competent mental health expert, failed to call certain witnesses, failed to investigate potential mitigating circumstances, and failed to ensure that the jury verdict slip was proper. We disagree.\nHenry claims that counsel was ineffective for presenting Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony at the penalty hearing because Dr. O\u2019Brien failed to examine Henry adequately. According to Henry\u2019s psychological expert at the PCRA hearing, Dr. Barry Crown, if Dr. O\u2019Brien had properly evaluated Henry, he would have discovered that Henry had brain damage resulting from complications at birth, head injuries and substance abuse, and psychological problems from childhood sexual abuse.\nBefore obtaining the services of Dr. O\u2019Brien, counsel consulted with Dr. Sadoff, a well-known psychiatrist. Counsel arranged for Dr. Sadoff to examine Henry, and he made numerous records available to Dr. Sadoff, including an EEG report, an alcohol-provoked EEG and videotape, statements from Henry\u2019s friends and acquaintances after his arrest, high school records, college records, and hospital records of Henry\u2019s father and uncle. However, Dr. Sadoff did not discover the brain damage and psychological problems that Dr. Crown alleges. Trial counsel also retained Dr. Cooke, a noted psychologist, and made the same records available to him that he had given to Dr. Sadoff. Dr. Cooke also did not diagnose the brain damage and psychological problems that Dr. Crown uncovered. Trial counsel then consulted Dr. O\u2019Brien. In addition to supplying Dr. O\u2019Brien with the same records he gave to Dr. Sadoff and Dr. Cooke, counsel arranged for Henry to undergo a computerized axial tomography scan and a magnetic resonance imaging scan and provided those test results to Dr. O\u2019Brien. Again, Dr. O\u2019Brien did not find the purported brain damage and psychological problems that Dr. Crown diagnosed.\nOn this record, trial counsel\u2019s presentation of Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony at the penalty phase did not constitute ineffective assistance. As the PCRA court stated:\n[Henry] contends that [trial counsel\u2019s] failure to find Dr. Crown or a similar witness, rendered [counsel] ineffective in his assistance in the case. The Court cannot agree. [Trial counsel\u2019s] defense effort conformed to high standards in all spheres, including his attempt to develop a mental defect defense. It is not ineffective assistance solely because one fails to do exactly what another with hindsight would have done....\nCounsel\u2019s choice was reasonable and well planned, and failing to choose an optional course is not ineffective assistance of counsel. It is folly to suggest that somewhere \u201cout there\u201d is exculpatory testimony such as that of Dr. Crown, an available witness unknown to defense counsel at the time of trial. To suggest otherwise would require defense counsel in every case to exhaust every expert anywhere, perhaps in the world, until counsel found the \u201cperfect\u201d witness____ The issue is whether or not counsel plotted and followed a reasonable course of action to assist his client in preparing for the trial and presenting testimony. The Court finds that he did.\nPCRA court slip. op. at 59-60 (citation omitted) (footnotes omitted). We agree with the PCRA court that trial counsel followed a reasonable and prudent course. Accordingly, we find no merit in Henry\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness. Morris (counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for choosing one reasonable course over another).\nHenry argues that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate incidents of head trauma and sexual abuse from Henry\u2019s past, and for failing to call witnesses who would have testified to these incidents. Henry specifically alleges that his mother would have testified concerning his head injuries and sexual abuse, and three of his friends would have testified concerning his head injuries. We note that trial counsel called numerous lay witnesses during the penalty phase, including Henry\u2019s mother, his brother, his grandmother, his minister, his English professor, the Coordinator of Volunteer Services at Northampton County Prison, several of Henry\u2019s friends, and Henry himself. None of these witnesses mentioned anything about his head injuries or sexual abuse. Counsel had three separate doctors evaluate Henry and none of them discovered his head injuries or sexual abuse. Finally, the PCRA court found that the PCRA testimony of Henry\u2019s mother and three friends \u201cwas either cumulative or nonpersuasive in terms of the establishment of mitigating circumstances beyond those found by the jury.\u201d PCRA court slip, op. at 62. On this record, we believe counsel pursued a reasonable course and find no merit in Henry\u2019s ineffectiveness claim. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Appel, 547 Pa. 171, 689 A.2d 891 (1997) (counsel will not be deemed ineffective for failing to conduct further investigation into client\u2019s competency when qualified experts and available facts show client to be competent).\nHenry next argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial court\u2019s charge and verdict slip, which, according to Henry, gave the jury members the impression that they unanimously had to find a mitigating circumstance before they could give effect to that circumstance in their sentencing decision. He claims that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Mills v. Maryland, 486 U.S. 367, 108 S.Ct. 1860, 100 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988) supports his argument and requires us to grant him relief. We disagree.\n\u201cIn Mills, the jury instructions and verdict slip utilized at trial contained specific elements of language and form that created a substantial risk of jurors being misled to believe that, unless they agreed unanimously on the existence of any given mitigating circumstance, the circumstance could not be taken into account by any of the jurors during deliberations.\u201d Commonwealth v. Frey, 520 Pa. 338, 346, 554 A.2d 27, 31 (1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1038, 110 S.Ct. 1500, 108 L.Ed.2d 635 (1990) (citation omitted). The jury instructions and verdict slip here, however, do not contain the language or form that was cause for concern in Mills. Indeed, this Court reviewed jury instructions substantially similar to those here in Commonwealth v. Banks, 540 Pa. 143, 656 A.2d 467, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 835, 116 S.Ct. 113, 133 L.Ed.2d 65 (1995), and Commonwealth v. Wilson, 538 Pa. 485, 649 A.2d 435 (1994), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 850, 116 S.Ct. 145, 133 L.Ed.2d 91 (1995) and found no violation of Mills. In Frey, we reviewed a verdict slip substantially similar to the slip here and concluded there was no violation of Mills. Despite the fact that the PCRA court relied on Banks and Wilson in rejecting Henry\u2019s claim, and the fact that both of those cases reference Frey, Henry has not bothered to address Banks, Wilson, Frey, or any other Pennsylvania case discussing this issue. This claim warrants no further review.\nHenry\u2019s final claim of ineffective assistance concerns a series of photographs depicting the wounds on Cler/s body. The trial court admitted some of the photographs during the guilt phase and others during the penalty phase. At each stage, counsel objected that the photographs were inflammatory and prejudicial, but the trial court overruled the objection. Henry now asserts that counsel was ineffective for failing to ensure that this Court received those photographs on direct appeal, which denied him meaningful appellate review. This claim is without merit.\nThe underlying foundation for Henry\u2019s claim of ineffectiveness is that the photographs were inadmissible because of their inflammatory and prejudicial nature. Photographs of a murder victim, however, are not per se inadmissible. Commonwealth v. Auker, 545 Pa. 521, 681 A.2d 1305 (1996). The decision to admit such photographs is vested within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of that discretion. Id. To determine whether the photographs in question are admissible, a court must undertake a two-step analysis. Commonwealth v. Saranchak, 544 Pa. 158, 675 A.2d 268 (1996), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 695, 136 L.Ed.2d 617 (1997). First, the court must decide if the photographs are inflammatory. Id. If the court finds the photographs inflammatory, then the court must apply a balancing test to decide if the evidentiary need for the photographs clearly outweighs the likelihood of inflaming the minds and passions of the jurors. Commonwealth v. Marshall, 523 Pa. 556, 568 A.2d 590 (1989). When applying this two-part test, a court should be guided by the following:\nA criminal homicide trial is, by its very nature, unpleasant, and the photographic images of the injuries inflicted are merely consonant with the brutality of the subject of inquiry. To permit the disturbing nature of the images of the victim to rule the question of admissibility would result in exclusion of all photographs of the homicide victim, and would defeat one of the essential functions of a criminal trial, inquiry into the intent of the actor. There is no need to so overextend an attempt to sanitize the evidence of the condition of the body as to deprive the Commonwealth of opportunities of proof in support of the onerous burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\nCommonwealth v. McCutchen, 499 Pa. 597, 602, 454 A.2d 547, 549 (1982). Even where the condition of the victim\u2019s body can be described through a medical examiner\u2019s testimony, the testimony does not obviate the admissibility of the photographs. Anker; Commonwealth v. Rush, 538 Pa. 104, 646 A.2d 557 (1994).\nIn its opinion denying Henry\u2019s post-trial motions, the trial court described the admission of the contested photographs during the guilt phase as follows:\nOf the black and white photographs admitted, only Nos. 26 and 30 depicted a side view of the victim\u2019s bite-marked cheek and a frontal view of her scratched neck. The other photographs depicted bruises on her legs and feet.\nWe have reviewed and adopt our trial court ruling that none of the photographs were gruesome because they were taken in such a manner that they could be photos of wounds from a live person as well as a deceased person. In addition, each of the photographs was necessary to establish the defendant\u2019s requisite intent for a first degree murder conviction and also substantiated the other charges of assault, rape and sodomy. Accordingly, we find that the photographs possessed essential evidentiary value sufficient to outweigh the possibility that they would inflame the jury.\nTrial court slip. op. at 13-14. In describing the admission of the penalty phase photographs, the court stated:\nAs an aid to the testimony of Dr. Mihalakis and Lieutenant Shupp in describing the nature of the injuries they observed, the court allowed into evidence four photographs of the victim depicting bite marks on her cheeks and breast, lacerations throughout the neck area, bruises about the neck, legs and vaginal-anal areas. The photographs of the victim\u2019s injuries in the penalty phase were probative of the vicious nature and extent of the injuries the defendant inflicted upon the victim beyond the amount necessary to kill her. The judge promptly issued cautionary instructions when the photographs were first circulated and then again prior to the jury\u2019s deliberations. We find that the trial court\u2019s instructions cured any possible inflammatory effect the photographs may have had and that their probative value concerning the defendant\u2019s intent to subject the victim to torture required their submission.\nTrial court slip. op. at 33-34 (citation omitted).\nWe have reviewed all of the photographs in question and the trial court\u2019s cautionary instructions at the guilt and penalty phases, and we agree that the admission of the photographs was proper. See Faulkner (graphic photographs were admissible where trial court gave cautionary instructions); Commonwealth v. Chester, 526 Pa. 578, 587 A.2d 1367, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 959, 112 S.Ct. 422, 116 L.Ed.2d 442 (1991) (photographs clearly depicting the victim\u2019s slashed throat, open eye and other head injuries were admissible); Commonwealth v. Edwards, 521 Pa. 134, 555 A.2d 818 (1989) (color photographs showing strangulation area of victim\u2019s neck, defensive wounds on victim\u2019s hands, and bite-marks on left arm and both legs were admissible); compare, Commonwealth v. Chacko, 480 Pa. 504, 506, 391 A.2d 999, 1000 (1978) (photographs of victim\u2019s body in undergarments, \u201csplattered with blood\u201d, and depicting a gaping neck wound were inadmissible). Because the admission of the photographs was proper, Henry\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance is without merit.\nCONCLUSION\nAfter reviewing each of Henry\u2019s claims, we find no basis on which to grant him relief. Accordingly, we affirm the Order of the PCRA court.\n. By raising an insanity defense, a defendant is seeking one of two verdicts: not guilty by reason of insanity, or guilty but mentally ill. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 314; 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 315. For a discussion of the insanity defense and its consequences, see Commonwealth v. Reilly, 519 Pa. 550, 549 A.2d 503 (1988); Commonwealth v. Sohmer, 519 Pa. 200, 546 A.2d 601 (1988).\n. The stay petition was prepared by attorneys from the Pennsylvania Capital Case Resource Center, which the PCRA court described as \"a federally funded agency whose mission is to review state death sentences.\u201d PCRA court slip. op. at 3 n. 4.\n. At the hearing, Billy \u00d1olas, Esquire, em attorney then with the Pennsylvania Capital Case Resource Center, and Yvonne Bradley, Esquire, an attorney with the Federal Habeas Corpus Unit, entered appearances for Henry.\n. Henry's brief contains a section entitled \"Introduction, Statement of the Case and Summary of Argument\u201d, which blends together the factual and procedural history of the case with a summary of Henry\u2019s arguments for relief. Brief of Appellant at 4-12. This section violates several Rules of Appellate Procedure. See Pa.R.A.P. 2111(a) (sections of the appellant\u2019s brief shall be separately and distinctively entitled); Pa.R.A.P. 2117(a)(1) (statement of the case shall contain a statement of the form of action, followed by a brief procedural history of the case); Pa.R.A.P. 2117(a)(3) (statement of the case shall contain the names of the judges whose determinations are to be reviewed); Pa.R.A.P. 2117(a)(4) (statement of the case shall contain a closely condensed chronological statement of all necessary facts); Pa.R.A.P. 2117(b) (statement of the case shall not contain any argument, and appellant has the responsibility to include a balanced presentation of the history of the proceedings and the contentions of the parties); Pa.R.A.P. 2117(c) (statement of the case shall contain a statement of the place where issues were raised or preserved); Pa.R.A.P. 2118 (summary of the argument shall be concise, never to exceed two pages). Although counsel\u2019s disregard for the Rules does not preclude our review here, we remind counsel that appellate review is best served when the parties comply with the Rules of Appellate Procedure.\n. Henry also states that the Commonwealth's actions violated his rights under the Fifth Amendment, the Eighth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. However, Henty provides neither authority nor argument for these claims, and thus, we will not address them.\n. Although the plurality opinion in Simmons only garnered four votes, a three Justice concurring opinion concluded that \u201c[wjhere the State puts the defendant's future dangerousness in issue, and the only available alternative sentence to death is life imprisonment without possibility of parole, due process entitles the defendant to inform the capital sentencing jury\u2014by either argument or instruction\u2014that he is parole ineligible.\u201d Simmons, 512 U.S. at 178, 114 S.Ct. at 2201 (O'Connor, J., concurring).\n. Even if Simmons were applicable here, Henry would not be entitled to relief. As the PCRA court explained, \"[Henry] has failed to demonstrate that future conduct became a retd issue at his trial____ Our review discloses no ready reference to future criminal activity made by the Commonwealth.\u201d PCRA court slip. op. at 44. Because his future dangerousness was not at issue, Henry\u2019s Simmons claim is without merit. Commonwealth v. Gibson, 547 Pa. 71, 688 A.2d 1152, cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 364, 139 L.Ed.2d 284 (1997) (Simmons does not apply where future dangerousness is not at issue); Commonwealth v. Speight, 544 Pa. 451, 677 A.2d 317 (1996), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. -, 117 S.Ct. 967, 136 L.Ed.2d 852 (1997) (same).\n. First, trial counsel asked Juror No. 118 if he ever had any experiences with black people that would prevent him from rendering a fair and impartial verdict, to which the juror responded in the negative. N.T. April 8, 1987 at 59. Second, he asked Juror No. 167 if she worked with any black persons and she responded that she worked with one. N.T. April 9, 1987 at 224. Counsel further asked if the juror was friendly with that person, to which she answered in the affirmative. Id. Third, the prosecutor, asked Juror No. 56 if she would have any difficulty sitting in this case considering that the defendant is black and the victim is white, and she answered in the negative. N.T. April 10, 1987 (Vol.II) at 265.\n. See N.T. April 8, 1987 at 90-106; N.T. April 9, 1987 at 43-67, 177-195; N.T. April 10, 1987 (Vol.II) at 139-158, 187-207, 277-296; N.T. April 13, 1987 at 59-84, 208-230. Concerning Juror No. 117, Henry raised the failure to race qualify him on direct appeal and this Court rejected the claim. Henry, 524 Pa. at 147 n. 3, 569 A.2d at 935 n. 3. Thus, any claim concerning that juror\u2019s potential racial bias has been previously litigated and is not cognizable under the PCRA. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9543(a)(3).\n. N.T. April 8, 1987 at 18-20, 56-58, 100; N.T. April 9, 1987 at 56, 223; N.T. April 10, 1987 (Vol.II) at 148, 199, 286; N.T. April 13, 1987 at 66-67, 223.\n. N.T. April 9, 1987 at 186-87; N.T.

The M\u2019Naghten standard has been codified as the standard for an insanity defense in Pennsylvania, and \"the phrase legally insane' means that, at the time of the commission of the offense, the actor was laboring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing or, if the actor did know the quality of the act, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 315(b); see also 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 314(d).
