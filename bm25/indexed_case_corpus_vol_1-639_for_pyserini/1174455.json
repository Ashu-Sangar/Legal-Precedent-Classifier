{"id": "1174455", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis is an action by the minor plaintiff to recover damages for the death of her mother caused by her being struck near the intersection of 62nd and Chestnut Streets, in the City of Philadelphia, by defendant\u2019s automobile operated by him.\nThe jury found a verdict in defendant\u2019s favor. The court below granted a new trial on the ground that the trial judge had instructed the jury that there was no evidence from which they might find that the lights on defendant\u2019s car were out before the accident. The court in banc was of the opinion that the question whether the lights were or were not lit should have been submitted to the jury. In this conclusion the trial judge concurred. We are not convinced that the grant of the new trial under the circumstances was an abuse of discretion.\nThe order is affirmed."}
