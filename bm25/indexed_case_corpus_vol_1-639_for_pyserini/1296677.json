{"id": "1296677", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nThese appeals are from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Westmoreland County. The facts in the case are not in dispute since the parties have filed an agreed statement.\nOn September 8, 1920, Samuel Miller obtained a policy of life insurance from the Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company and subsequently designated seven beneficiaries. On December 21, 1949, Samuel Miller was adjudicated a weak-minded person and the First National Bank in Greensburg was appointed guardian of his estate.\nOn September 8, 1950, the Court of Common Pleas of Westmoreland County decreed that the guardian, \u201c. . . is hereby authorized to borrow the sum of Twenty-four Thousand ($24,000.00) Dollars, from the Union National Bank in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and put up as collateral security the policy of insurance . . . issued ... by The Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company. . . An assignment of the policy was duly filed with the insurance company and the authorized loan was made to the guardian. Samuel Miller died testate on February 8, 1952. The insurance company paid $24,447.99 to the bank, that Sum being the amount then due on the loan made by the guardian.\nThe several beneficiaries named in the insurance policy filed a claim with the estate for $24,447.99, claiming the estate was indebted to them for the proceeds of the insurance policy used to repay the bank loan. The lower court approved the claim and filed a schedule of distribution which provided for partial payment, to the insurance beneficiaries by way of subrogation to the bank\u2019s claim. The award consumed the entire balance of the estate and no distribution was available for the appellants.\nExceptions were filed by the three appellants to the allowance of the claim of the insurance beneficiaries. These appeals have been taken from the decree dismissing the exceptions.\nThese appeals require us to answer \u2014 Are the beneficiaries of an insurance policy entitled to recover from the insured\u2019s estate, by way of subrogation, the proceeds of an insurance policy on the insured\u2019s life, which policy the guardian of the insured, \u2022 a weak-minded person, with court approval assigned to a bank as collateral for a loan for the benefit of the weak-minded person\u2019s estate, and the proceeds of which repaid the loan? The court below permitted the recovery and we agree.\nThe issue which is usually determinative of the problem in this area is the intention of the parties as indicated by the terms of the will, the insurance policy, the assignment and any other pertinent extrinsic evidence. When we apply this test, we find that there is usually no claim against a decedent\u2019s estate under an \u201cinsurance policy loan\u201d because, by mutual agreement, the insurance company restricts itself to the proceeds of the policy for repayment of the loan. Thus, there can be no subrogation by the insurance beneficiaries. See Schwartz Estate, 369 Pa. 574, 87 A. 2d 270 (1952); Black\u2019s Estate, 341 Pa. 264, 19 A. 2d 130 (1941). Here, however, the problem is somewhat different since the insurance company did not make the loan; the insurance policy is merely collateral for a loan from a bank. The creditor in this case does have a claim against decedent\u2019s estate as well as against the collateral. Nevertheless, the intention of the parties, if ascertainable, must control.\nin Wilson Estate, 363 Pa. 546, 70 A. 2d 354 (1950), where the policy of life insurance, containing the right to assign and to change beneficiaries, was assigned to a bank as collateral for a loan, this Court found, in a case involving inheritance taxes, that the amount of the debt secured by the collateral was a debt of the estate. This conclusion was reached on the basis of decedent\u2019s intent as expressed in the terms of the assignment to the bank. In the Wilson case we went on to say, as dicta, that, \u201cHad the creditor bank used decedent-settlor\u2019s insurance collateral to liquidate its loan, the designated insurance beneficiaries could have enforced their claim against the estate of the decedent under their right of subrogation. . . .\u201d In light of our interpretation of decedent\u2019s intent in that case this dicta was a correct statement of the law.\nAlthough the orphans\u2019 court in Biron Estate, 4 Pa. D. & C. 2d 729 (1955), (relied upon by the defendant) denied subrogation, that case is clearly consistent with the standards set forth by this Court. In Biron Estate the assignment specifically gave the bank the right to apply the proceeds of the policy against the debt and, after the amount necessary to satisfy the loan was deducted, to turn over any balance of the proceeds to the insurance beneficiaries. There could be no question as to decedent\u2019s intent in that case. Similarly, this Court in adopting the orphans\u2019 court opinion in Goldstein Estate, 384 Pa. 1, 119 A. 2d 278 (1956), 4. Pa. D. & C. 2d 606 (1954), sustained the proposition that the decedent\u2019s intent must control as to whether insurance beneficiaries get the net or gross proceeds under a policy which is assigned as collateral for a loan.\nIn the present case, the loan was negotiated pursuant to an order of the court by the guardian of a weak-minded person. The only evidence of the insured\u2019s intent would be his purpose as expressed at the time he designated the beneficiaries and that intent was that the beneficiaries should have the gross proceeds of the policy.\nIt is not necessary to decide whether the court or the guardian had the power to interfere with deedent\u2019s intended disposition since the action of the court and the guardian is not inconsistent with decedent\u2019s intent. The loan was made for the benefit of the estate. The remaining unpaid portion at decedent\u2019s death was a claim against the estate, and the life insurance policy was merely collateral for the loan.\nDecree affirmed at appellants\u2019 cost.\nMr. Justice Benjamin R. Jones concurs in the result."}
