{"id": "1717335", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nThis appeal arises from an order of Commonwealth Court which sustained summary dismissal of appellant, Milton Tyler, from his employment with appellee, Jefferson County-Du Bois Area Vocational Technical School.\nThe facts surrounding this appeal are as follows. In September, 1968, appellant received a Provisional Teacher\u2019s Certificate issued by the Commonwealth which authorized his teaching of the following courses: Business Education, Business English, Typing, Bookkeeping and Business Mathematics. Appellant was employed in September, 1971, by the appellee school district to teach Distributive Education. Since appellant\u2019s provisional certificate did not include Distributive Education, he received from the Department of Education an \u201cInterim Certificate\u201d which permitted him to teach Distributive Education. In December, 1978, appellant\u2019s interim certificate was amended to an \u201cInstructional I Certificate\u201d which also authorized him to teach Distributive Education.\nIn May of 1974, appellant received his first Temporary Professional rating by letter from Dr. George N. Nye, Superintendent of the appellee school district. The rating was unsatisfactory and Dr. Nye indicated that he would recommend to the school board that appellant be dismissed on grounds of incompetence and insubordination. By letter dated May 28, 1974, appellee terminated the employment contract of appellant, effective the end of the 1973-74 school year. The letter further informed appellant that a hearing was to be held on June 12, 1974. On that date, appellant, accompanied by counsel, appeared at the \u201chearing\u201d but refused to proceed with the hearing because of the lack of a disinterested public stenographer and the School Board\u2019s failure to furnish him with a detailed written statement of the charges.\nAppellant then filed a mandamus action in the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas to compel the appellee school district to follow the mandatory dismissal requirements as set forth in the Public School Code of 1949, \u00a7 1127, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1127. The Jefferson County Court entered judgment for appellee and Commonwealth Court affirmed that order. We granted appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal and now reverse.\nAppellant argues that he was a \u201cprofessional employee\u201d at the time of his dismissal and, therefore, was entitled to the procedural safeguards provided in \u00a7 1127 of the Public School Code of 1949. We agree.\nThe starting point of our analysis is the question of when appellant became a \u201ctemporary professional.\u201d Section 11-1101 of the Public School Code of 1949 provides, inter alia,'.\n\u201cAs used in this article,\n\u201c(1) The term \u2018professional employe\u2019 shall include those who are certificated as teachers .\n\u201c(3) The term \u2018temporary professional employe\u2019 shall mean any individual who has been employed to perform, for a limited time, the duties of a newly created position or of a regular professional employe whose services have been terminated by death, resignation, suspension or removal.\u201d As amended October 5, 1967, P.L. 348, \u00a7 1; July 22, 1969, P.L. 172, \u00a7 1; November 30, 1971, P.L. 546, No. 144, \u00a7 1, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1101.\nThe above definitional section provides that the term \u201ctemporary professional employee\u201d is any \u201cindividual who has been employed \u00a1, to perform, for a limited time\u201d either the duties of a new position or the duties of a \u201cprofessional employee\u201d as defined by subsection (1) of this section, because of death, resignation or suspension. The record in the instant case establishes that appellant was hired to perform the duties of a new position or to replace a \u201cprofessional employee\u201d in teaching Distributive Education.\nThe next step of the analysis requires us to determine whether appellant was qualified to be a temporary professional.\nSection 1251(1) of the Public School Code provides:\n\u201c(1) \u2018Teacher\u2019 shall mean any person who holds a valid Pennsylvania teaching certificate.\u201d\nSection 1201 of the Code provides for nine different types of certificates which allow a person to teach in the schools, including:\n\u201c(9) . . . such other kinds of certificates as are issued under the standards prescribed by the State Board of Education. The State Board of Education shall also provide for issuance of certificates by district superintendents to meet such emergencies or shortage of teachers as may occur.\u201d As amended October 21, 1965, P.L; 601, \u00a7 28; January 14, 1970, P.L. (1969) 468, \u00a7 42, effective July 1, 1970, 24 P.S. \u00a7 12-1201.\nIn the instant case, appellant held a valid \u201cintern\u201d or \u201cinterim\u201d certificate issued as of October, 1971, pursuant to subsection (9) of the above-cited provision. Therefore, appellant is a certified teacher within the meaning of \u00a7 1101, subsection (1) of the Public School Code of 1949. See also Brentwood Borough Sch. Dist. Appeal, 439 Pa. 256, 267 A.2d 848 (1970).\nHaving found that appellant was an \u201cindividual\u201d employed to perform the duties of a certificated teacher, and also finding that appellant is a certificated teacher, we are of the opinion that appellant became a temporary professional in October, 1971, when he was employed with a valid \u201cInterim-Intern\u201d Teaching Certificate.\nAppellee contends that appellant did not gain \u201ctemporary professional\u201d status until the issuance in December, 1973, of the Instructional I certificate. We do not agree. The foregoing statutory language does not differentiate between any of the nine certificates listed in \u00a7 1201 of the Code and, therefore, the holding of any one certificate would \u201ccertificate\u201d an individual for purposes of \u00a7 1101.\nMoreover, appellee contends that it could not rate appellant until he received the Instructional I certificate. We do not agree. The performance of an individual in his work is always susceptible to evaluation. The absence of a particular type of certificate in no way prohibits inquiry into and evaluation of class performance of individual instructors.\nThe next part of our inquiry requires us to determine when appellant did become a \u201cprofessional employee\u201d.\nSection 11-1108 (a) and (b) of the Public School Code of 1949 provides in part:\n\u201c(a) It shall be the duty of the district superintendent to notify each temporary professional employe, at least twice each year during the period of his or her employment, of the professional quality, professional progress, and rating of his or her services. No temporary professional employe shall be dismissed unless rated unsatisfactory, and notification, in writing, of such unsatisfactory rating shall have been furnished the employe within ten (10) days following the date of such rating. The rating of a temporary professional employe shall be done as provided in section one thousand one hundred twenty-three of this act.\u201d As amended January 14, 1970, P.L. (1969) 468, \u00a7 38, effective July 1,1970,24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1108.\n\u201c(b) A temporary professional employe whose work has been certified by the district superintendent to the secretary of the school district, during the last four (4) months of the second year of such service, as being satisfactory shall thereafter be a \u2018professional employe\u2019 within the meaning of this article. The attainment of this status shall be recorded in the records of the board and written notification thereof shall be sent also to the employe. The employe shall then be tendered forthwith a regular contract of employment as provided for professional employes. No professional employe who has attained tenure status in any school district of this Commonwealth shall thereafter be required to serve as a temporary professional employe before being tendered such a contract when employed by any other part of the public school system of the Commonwealth.\u201d As amended May 14, 1968, P.L. 119, No. 62, \u00a7 2; January 14, 1970, P.L. (1969) 468, \u00a7 88, effective July 1,1969,24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1108.\nThe above two subsections establish the mandatory duty in the district superintendent to rate each temporary professional employee twice a year and provides that if during the last four months of the two-year period a satisfactory rating is given to the temporary professional, he or she shall become a \u201cprofessional employee.\u201d\nThis court, in Elias v. Bd. of Sch. Directors, 421 Pa. 260, 218 A.2d 738 (1966), in construing identical language of \u00a7 1108\u2019s predecessor, found that the absence of ratings during the prescribed two-year period compels a conclusion of satisfactory performance. The court in Elias stated:\n\u201cAccordingly, we find that under \u00a7 1108, the failure on the part of the superintendent to rate is tantamount to a satisfactory rating.\u201d At page 266, 218 A.2d at page 742.\nIn the instant case, the record reveals that no ratings pursuant to \u00a7 1108 were given appellant during the school years of 1971-72, 1972-73, and it was not until May, 1974, that appellant received any rating. We are, therefore, of the opinion that appellant became a professional employee at the end of the 1972-73 school year because of the board\u2019s failure to rate appellant\u2019s conduct. See Elias, supra.\nHaving found appellant to be a professional employee, appellee, Jefferson County-Du Bois Area Vocational Technical School, must accord the procedural safeguards of \u00a7 1127 of the Public School Code of 1949.\nOrder of the Commonwealth Court is reversed and case is remanded for proceedings and hearing consistent with this opinion.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which ROBERTS, J., joined."}
