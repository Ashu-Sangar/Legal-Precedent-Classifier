{"id": "1169576", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nFrank B. Metz died in 1919, leaving a will, naming Ms wife, Mary E. Metz, as executrix and giving her the residue of his estate for life with the power of consumption. At her death, \u201cwhatsoever may be left\u201d was to be divided among his sisters and brother-in-law. The widow on probating the will stated of record that decedent possessed no real or personal property. She filed an affidavit stating decedent\u2019s property was owned by entireties and therefore not subject to tax. On August 18, 1934, she died and gave the residue of her estate to her nephew. Her executor filed an account to which a residuary legatee of Frank Metz excepted, alleging certain bonds in the widow\u2019s estate belonged to the husband\u2019s estate. The court below dismissed the exceptions. This appeal followed.\nAppellant as residuary legatee of the husband\u2019s estate could have cited the widow as executrix to file an account: Act of June 7, 1917, P. L. 447, section 46(a). For a period of sixteen years she waited and at this late date seeks to assert rights against the widow\u2019s estate which she claims as residuary legatee of the husband\u2019s estate.\nIf appellant has any light not lost by laches she must assert it against the estate of the first decedent; it is to his estate that she must look. She has no interest in the widow\u2019s estate, since she is not claiming as a creditor, heir, or legatee of that estate, and cannot interfere with its administration. See High\u2019s Estate, 136 Pa. 222, 236, and authorities cited therein.\nThe life tenant had the right of consumption, and appellant is entitled only to the property of the husband which was not consumed by his widow during her lifetime, but these matters can only be passed on by a court which has jurisdiction over the husband\u2019s estate.\nDecrees affirmed at appellants\u2019 cost."}
