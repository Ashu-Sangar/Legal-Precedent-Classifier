{"id": "1904924", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nThe issue herein is whether or not certain funds are subject to payment of the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax.\nThe facts stipulated of record are these: William G. Daniels, an employee of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, retired on September 20, 1962. He died five days later before receiving payment of any benefits due him under the provisions of the State Employes\u2019 Retirement Code, Act of June 1, 1959, P. L. 392, as amended, 71 P.S. \u00a71725-101 et seq. Before his death, he designated three sisters, Florence C. Allen, Alice M. Daniels and May D. Stegmaier, as beneficiaries of any unpaid benefits due Mm at the time of Ms death. Each was to receive one-third of the amount due. This totalled $7360.44 in each instance, since he had $22,081.32 in the fund at the time of his death. Florence C. Allen and Alice M. Daniels each elected to receive and were paid their respective shares in a lump sum. However, May D. Stegmaier elected to leave her share in the State Retirement Fund, and to receive it in the form of a five-year annuity payable in monthly installments of $135.28 each.\nAt the time of the above election, May D. Stegmaier designated that in the event of her death, any balance of her share remaining unpaid should be paid to her sister, Alice M. Daniels. May D. Stegmaier died March 11, 1964. As of that date, the sum of $5,033.63 remained unpaid. However, since the designated beneficiary, Alice M. Daniels, predeceased her in death (having died on October 23, 1963), the Commonwealth in accordance with the directions of the code paid the balance due to the administrator of May D. Stegmaier\u2019s estate.\nThe above asset was reported by the administrator in his inventory and tax return as not taxable. The Commonwealth assessed inheritance tax thereon. The court below sustained the administrator\u2019s position and ruled the funds were not subject to the tax. The Commonwealth appeals.\nDetermination of the issue presented depends upon the correct interpretation and construction of \u00a7803 of the Act of 1959, supra, 71 P.S. \u00a71725-803, which provides in relevant part as follows: \u201c[A]ny benefit or right accrued or accruing to any person under the provisions of this act, and the moneys in the fund created under this act, are hereby exempt from any State or municipal tax. . . .\u201d\nIn Belefski Estate, 413 Pa. 365, 196 A. 2d 850 (1964), we ruled that where the proceeds of the State Retirement Fund are paid to the legal representative of the estate of a deceased contributor to that fund, and thereafter pass to those who take from him either by will or by operation of the intestate laws, said funds are included within the exemption and not subject to the Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax.\nThe Commonwealth contends that the instant situation is factually different and not necessarily controlled by Belefshi, supra. With this we agree. The Commonwealth further contends that the fund involved herein had already reached control of the contributor\u2019s beneficiary, May D. Stegmaier, and it was not intended by the legislature to extend the exemption to the funds when paid to the legal representative of the estate of the deceased beneficiary, and thereafter to those entitled thereto under the beneficiary\u2019s will, or by operation of the intestate laws. This may have been the intention of the legislature, but this is not what it said in the controlling statutory provision.\n\u2022 It must be emphasized, the money involved was still held by the State Retirement Fund when May D. Stegmaier died. It grew no larger as a result of remaining in the fund after the contributor\u2019s death. To repeat, \u00a7803, provides that, \u201cany benefit or right . . . accruing to any person (emphasis added) . . . are hereby exempt from any State . . . tax. . . This is certainly clear and unambiguous. The exemption applies to \u201cany person\u201d who receives money from the fund and is not restricted to the designated beneficiary.\nIt is fundamental that in ascertaining the legislature\u2019s intent, the plain words of its laws may not be ignored. Also, when the words of a law are clear and free from all ambiguity, they may not be disregarded. See, Statutory Construction Act, Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, \u00a7\u00a751 and 52, 46 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7551 and 552. See also, Milk Control Comm. v. Penn Fruit Co., 410 Pa. 242, 188 A. 2d 705 (1963), and Davis v. Sulcowe, 416 Pa. 138, 205 A. 2d 89 (1964).\nDecree affirmed. Costs on the Commonwealth.\nMr. Justice Roberts dissents.\nUnder Option (1) provided for in the Act of 1959, supra, \u00a7404, 71 P.S. \u00a71725-404."}
