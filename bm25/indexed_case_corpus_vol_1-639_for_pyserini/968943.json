It involved a question of fact, which was submitted to the jury with proper instructions by the learned judge who tried the cause below. There was abundant evidence of the ratification by Watson & Raydure of the act of R. A. Watson in purchasing Mr. Lukins\u2019 interest. It would serve no good purpose to review the numerous assignments of error in detail.\nJudgment affirmed."}
