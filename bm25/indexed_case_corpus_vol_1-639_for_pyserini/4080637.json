{"id": "4080637", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW, this 29th day of August, 2013, the Petition for Allowance of Appeal is GRANTED. The issues, as stated by Petitioner, are:\na. May a Philadelphia City Councilwoman recover for defamation based on an editorial, political cartoon, and letter to the editor that criticized her for accepting and keeping a $300,000 \u201cDROP\u201d retirement payment from the City (without actually retiring) at a time when the City was so financially distressed that a treasured library in her district was forced to close?\nb. Does Pennsylvania recognize a cause of action for false light invasion of privacy by an elected official for publications discussing her public, not private, actions?\nc. If Pennsylvania recognizes a false light invasion of privacy claim in such circumstances, may the claim proceed where the court has found that the First Amendment bars a defamation action based on the same publications?\nJustice McCAFFERY did not participate in the consideration of this matter."}
