{"id": "4329362", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice McCAFFERY.\nThis is a direct appeal from the judgment of sentence of death on two counts of first-degree murder. We affirm.\nOn April 21, 2010, Laquaille Bryant (\u201cAppellant\u201d) pled guilty to two counts of first-degree murder in the January 19, 2008 shooting deaths of Chante Wright and Octavia Green, as well as to one count each of intimidation of a witness, possession of a firearm, and possession of an instrument of crime. The Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the case was that Appellant killed Ms. Wright at the behest of one Hakeem Bey to prevent her from testifying at Bey\u2019s trial for the murder of one Moses Williams. Following a penalty-phase hearing, the jury found three aggravating circumstances with respect to the murder of Ms. Wright, to wit, convicted of another murder, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(ll); killing in retaliation against a witness, 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(15); and paid by another person for the killing of the victim, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(2). The jury found only the first aggravating circumstance, i.e. convicted of another murder, with respect to the murder of Ms. Green. In both cases, the jury found a single mitigating circumstance, the \u201ccatchall\u201d provision set forth in 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(e)(8). The jury returned with a verdict of death for each murder, and the trial court formally imposed sentence on May 5, 2010, immediately after the verdict.\nAppellant now appeals to this Court, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(1), seeking a new penalty-phase hearing based on the following three issues, which we reproduce verbatim:\nI. Should the defendant be awarded a new penalty phase hearing as a result of the Suppression Court\u2019s ruling which denied a Motion to Suppress the defendant\u2019s statement, and where the statement was used against the defendant at the penalty phase which considered whether the defendant had committed a contract murder or murder for hire?\nII. Is the defendant entitled to a new penalty phase hearing as the result of Court error where the Court permitted extremely inflammatory and prejudicial photographs of the victim, living at that time, to be introduced into the penalty phase hearing?\nIII. Is the defendant entitled to a new penalty phase hearing as the result of prosecutorial misconduct during that hearing where the Prosecutor pandered to the jury; inappropriately commented on the defendant\u2019s lack of remorse; misstated the evidence; and engaged in rhetoric concerning another and unrelated case?\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 3 (\u201cQuestions Presented\u201d).\nSUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\nThis Court has a self-imposed duty in all capital cases to conduct an independent review of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction for first-degree murder, a duty that is not abrogated when a defendant has pled guilty to first-degree murder. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Fears, 575 Pa. 281, 836 A.2d 52, 59 (2003) (conducting a sufficiency review on direct appeal in a capital case by considering the evidence that was presented at the appellant\u2019s suppression hearing and summarized by the Commonwealth at his guilty plea colloquy); Commonwealth v. Singley, 582 Pa. 5, 868 A.2d 403, 407-09 (2005) (in a double murder case where the appellant pled guilty to first-degree murder in the death of the first victim and to murder generally in the death of the second victim, conducting a sufficiency review by considering the evidence that was presented at the appellant\u2019s guilty plea, degree of guilt hearing, and penalty phase hearing); Commonwealth v. Ockenhouse, 562 Pa. 481, 756 A.2d 1130, 1133-35 (2000) (in a case where the appellant entered a guilty plea to first-degree murder on the first day of trial, conducting a sufficiency review by considering the appellant\u2019s confession, presented at trial); Commonwealth v. Michael, 544 Pa. 105, 674 A.2d 1044, 1045-47 (1996) (in a case where the appellant pled guilty to first-degree murder during the voir dire phase of trial, conducting a sufficiency review by considering testimony presented at the appellant\u2019s preliminary hearing as well as the appellant\u2019s testimony at his guilty plea hearing).\nTo sustain Appellant\u2019s plea to first-degree murder, we must conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, and all reasonable inferences derived therefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, proved beyond a reasonable doubt the three elements of first-degree murder, which are as follows: (1) a human being was unlawfully killed; (2) the defendant was responsible for the killing; and (3) the defendant acted with malice and a specific intent to kill. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a); Commonwealth v. Houser, 610 Pa. 264, 18 A.3d 1128, 1133 (2011). First-degree murder is an intentional killing, ie., a \u201cwillful, deliberate and premeditated killing.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(a) and (d); Fears, supra at 59. Specific intent to kill as well as malice can be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon upon a vital part of the victim\u2019s body. Houser, supra at 1133-34; Commonwealth v. Briggs, 608 Pa. 430, 12 A.3d 291, 306-07 (2011); Commonwealth v. Wright, 599 Pa. 270, 961 A.2d 119, 130-31 (2008). Recently, in Briggs, supra at 307, we concluded that the appellant\u2019s specific intent to kill was established by his deliberate and repeated shots to the chest and/or abdomen of the victims.\nHere, after the jury had been selected for trial, Appellant indicated his intention to plead guilty to two counts of first-degree murder and other charges. Notes of Testimony (\u201cN.T.\u201d), 4/21/10, at 6. After an extensive colloquy, conducted by the defense and the court, see id. at 6-17, the Commonwealth summarized before the court the evidence that would be presented were the matter to proceed to trial, as follows. Id. at 17-30.\nShortly after 2:00 a.m. on January 19, 2008, in South Philadelphia, police discovered the bodies of Chante Wright and Octavia Green, respectively on the sidewalk and in the passenger seat of a nearby vehicle. Both women had been shot multiple times from the back seat of the vehicle, and their deaths resulted from the gunshot wounds. Id. at 17-19. Appellant\u2019s fingerprint was found on the rear passenger side of the vehicle, just above the door handle. Id. at 22.\nMs. Wright was a -witness for the Commonwealth against an individual named Hakeem Bey, whose homicide trial was scheduled for March 2008. On the night of January 18, 2008, only hours before she was murdered, Ms. Wright had returned to Philadelphia from Florida, where she had been relocated as part of the federal witness relocation program. Id. at 19-20.\nCell phone records established that in January 2008, there were a series of calls among phones belonging to Appellant; both victims; and one Malik Bennett, who, at the time, was in a federal halfway house in Philadelphia. Id. at 20-23. On January 18, 2008, the day before the murders, there were numerous calls between Appellant and Bennett and between Appellant and Ms. Wright. Shortly before midnight on January 18, 2008, there was a call from Bennett\u2019s phone to Hakeem Bey\u2019s phone, and immediately thereafter a call from Bennett\u2019s phone to Appellant\u2019s phone. Id. at 23-24. FBI Agent Shute, an expert in the field of cell phone and cell site analysis, would have testified that during the time leading up to the murders, cell phones belonging to Appellant and both of the victims were traveling around the city together. Id. at 28-29. At 2:06 a.m. on January 19, 2008, which was approximately two minutes after the murders, there was a call from Appellant\u2019s phone to Bennett\u2019s phone, and Agent Shute would have further testified that this call was placed from an area near the location of the murders. Id. at 24, 29. Around 10:00 a.m. on the day of the murders, there were multiple calls between Bennett\u2019s phone and Hakeem Bey\u2019s phone, as well as between Bennett\u2019s phone and Appellant\u2019s phone. Id. at 24. Shortly thereafter, there was a call from Hakeem Bey\u2019s phone to Appellant\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s phone, followed by several return calls from the latter to the former. Id. at 24.\nThe Commonwealth would have also called several witnesses who knew Appellant and had seen him at various times before or after the murders. Jahmeia Harrell would have testified that on the weekend following the murders, she overheard a phone conversation between Appellant and Bennett in which Appellant stated that he had to get his money and Bennett had to \u201cget with his man.\u201d Id. at 25. Denise Wilson would have testified that a few hours before the murders, she was with Appellant at a bar in South Philadelphia when he received a phone call from Ms. Wright, and he said that she \u201cwas going to put him on some money.\u201d Id. Ms. Wilson would have further testified that at approximately 2:00 a.m. on the morning of the murders, Appellant came to her house with what appeared to be blood on his sneaker. At that time, Appellant called Bennett and told him \u201cIt\u2019s cool. We\u2019re going to be eating now.\u201d Id. at 26. Finally Ms. Wilson would have testified that she had previously seen Appellant with a revolver in his possession. Id. A firearms expert would have testified, from ballistics evidence recovered from the scene of the murders, that the murder weapon was a revolver. Id.\nAisha Kinney, Appellant\u2019s girlfriend and the mother of his daughter, would have testified to the following. Appellant told her a few days after the murder that he had done a job and was going to get paid. He also told her that he knew police were asking questions, and he asked her to burn the coat she had seen him wearing shortly after the murders. She soaked the coat in lighter fluid in the backyard, but did not burn it; police recovered the coat and a can of lighter fluid during their investigation. She also remembered seeing Appellant in her house the evening prior to the murders and remembered him returning to her home about 8:00 or 9:00 the next morning. Id. at 27-28.\nImmediately after this recitation of the evidence that the Commonwealth would have presented at the guilt phase of trial, Appellant pled guilty to two counts of first-degree murder. Id. at 30-34. Appellant specifically agreed that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence established each element of first-degree murder. Id. at 31. We conclude that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, and all reasonable inferences deducible therefrom, was indeed sufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the first-degree murders of Ms. Wright and Ms. Green. We turn now to the issues raised by Appellant.\nSUPPRESSION OF APPELLANT\u2019S STATEMENT TO POLICE\nIn Appellant\u2019s first issue, he claims that an inculpatory statement he gave to police on February 8, 2008, was involuntary and not the product of his free will; therefore, Appellant further asserts, the trial court erred by admitting it into evidence. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 12. In this statement to police, Appellant confessed to the killing of Ms. Wright and Ms. Green, but he denied acting at the behest of Hakeem Bey or for monetary reward. Prior to trial, Appellant filed a motion to suppress his inculpatory statement, which the trial court denied after holding a two-day evidentiary hearing. See N.T. Suppression Hearing, 3/24/10 and 3/30/10. During the penalty phase of trial, the Commonwealth introduced the statement into evidence, and the detective who took the statement read his questions and Appellant\u2019s responses into the record. See N.T., 4/28/10, at 21-38; Commonwealth Exhibit 73 (C-73). Before this Court, Appellant argues that his inculpatory statement was involuntary and thus should not have been admitted into evidence because, prior to giving the statement, he had been in custody for approximately thirty hours; kept in isolation, with little to eat or drink and no place to sleep; and subjected to repeated interrogation to convince him that he would not leave the police station until he confessed. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 12-17.\nThe legal principles relevant to Appellant\u2019s claim are as follows. The test for determining the voluntariness, and thus the admissibility, of an accused\u2019s statement is the totality of the circumstances surrounding the statement. Commonwealth v. Perez, 577 Pa. 360, 845 A.2d 779, 787 (2004). The mere fact that there is some passage of time between when an accused is arrested and when he or she gives an inculpatory statement does not constitute grounds for suppression of the statement. Id. This Court has set forth the following numerous factors that should be considered under a totality of the circumstances test to determine whether a statement was freely and voluntarily made: the duration and means of interrogation, including whether questioning was repeated, prolonged, or accompanied by physical abuse or threats thereof; the length of the accused\u2019s detention prior to the confession; whether the accused was advised of his or her constitutional rights; the attitude exhibited by the police during the interrogation; the accused\u2019s physical and psychological state, including whether he or she was injured, ill, drugged, or intoxicated; the conditions attendant to the detention, including whether the accused was deprived of food, drink, sleep, or medical attention; the age, education, and intelligence of the accused; the experience of the accused with law enforcement and the criminal justice system; and any other factors which might serve to drain one\u2019s powers of resistance to suggestion and coercion. Id. at 785, 787.\nWhen we review the denial of a suppression motion, we are guided by the following principles:\n[0]ur initial task is to determine whether the [trial court\u2019s] factual findings are supported by the record. In making this determination, we must consider only the evidence of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, and so much evidence of the defense that remains uncontradicted when fairly read in the context of the record as a whole. When the evidence supports the factual findings, we are bound by such findings; we may reverse only if the legal conclusions drawn therefrom are erroneous.\nId. at 788 (citation omitted).\nHere, during the evidentiary hearing on Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress his inculpatory statement, the Commonwealth proffered the following witnesses: Detective Joseph Bamberski, who took an initial statement from Appellant in which he denied any involvement in the murders; Detective John Harkins, who subsequently took Appellant\u2019s second, inculpatory statement; and Detective Verrecchio, the assigned detective in the investigation of the murders of Ms. Wright and Ms. Green. See N.T. Suppression Hearing, 3/24/10, at 4-92, and 3/30/10, at 5-55. The defense presented no witnesses, but simply argued that Appellant\u2019s inculpatory statement was coerced and involuntary because he had been in custody for approximately 34 hours prior to making the statement. N.T. Suppression Hearing, 3/30/10, at 56-57.\nThe trial court issued its decision denying Appellant\u2019s suppression motion at the close of the second day of the hearing, expressly holding that the detectives were credible witnesses, that Appellant had not been deprived during his time in custody, and that his statement was voluntary. Id. at 70. Specifically, the trial court made the following factual findings. On February 7, 2008, Appellant was taken into custody when police officers unexpectedly found him at Aisha Kinney\u2019s residence, where they had gone to look for a cell phone linked to the murders. Although Appellant was held for a lengthy period of time prior to giving his inculpatory statement, part of the reason for this was the enormous amount of evidence potentially relevant to the murders that the detectives were continuing to analyze. While Appellant was in custody, he was given food and drink, he was allowed to use a bathroom, he was given the opportunity to sleep and did in fact sleep. No psychological pressure was placed on Appellant during his time in custody. Prior to giving each of his statements, Appellant had been read his Miranda rights and had signed off on them. Prior to giving his inculpatory statement, Appellant had been permitted to speak to Ms. Kinney, whom he referred to as his \u201cwife.\u201d At the end of their private meeting, a detective overheard her tell Appellant to tell the truth when he asked her what he should do. Very shortly thereafter, Appellant gave the statement in which he admitted killing Ms. Wright and Ms. Green. Id. at 66-69; see also Trial Court Opinion at 3-4 (citing Perez\u2019s totality of the circumstances test and holding that Appellant had not been coerced into confessing and that his will had not been overborne).\nThe trial court\u2019s findings are supported by the record and there was no legal error. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s suppression motion and decline to grant Appellant relief.\nPHOTOGRAPHS OF THE VICTIM\u2019S CHILDREN\nIn Appellant\u2019s second issue, he claims that the trial court erred by permitting two photographs of Ms. Green\u2019s two children to be admitted into evidence and shown to the jury during the victim impact portion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case. Appellant asserts that the two photographs were irrelevant and inflammatory and merely engendered sympathy in the hearts of the jurors. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18-20. The trial court concluded that the photographs were relevant to show the jury those persons who were directly impacted by the murders and to illustrate their young ages. N.T., 4/28/10, at 48; Trial Court Opinion at 4.\nThe United States Supreme Court has recognized that \u201c[vjictim impact evidence is simply another form or method of informing the sentencing authority about the specific harm caused by the crime in question.\u201d Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 825, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720 (1991). In this Commonwealth, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(a)(2), \u201cevidence concerning the victim and the impact that the death of the victim has had on the family of the victim is admissible\u201d during the penalty phase of a capital trial. Regarding subseetion 9711(a)(2), this Court has concluded that \u201c[t]estimony that is a personal account describing the devastating impact the murders had on the surviving families is wholly appropriate and admissible at the sentencing phase of a capital case.\u201d Commonwealth v. Flor, 606 Pa. 384, 998 A.2d 606, 634 (2010) (citation omitted).\nAdmission of evidence, including victim impact evidence, rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, which must balance evidentiary value against the potential dangers of unfairly prejudicing the accused, inflaming the passions of the jury, or confusing the jury. Id. at 623; Commonwealth v. Eichinger, 591 Pa. 1, 915 A.2d 1122, 1139 (2007). We reaffirm our confidence in our trial judges to oversee the presentation of evidence \u201cso that overtly passionate, intentionally biased and inflammatory material is kept out of the courtroom.\u201d Eichinger, supra at 1139. We will reverse a trial court\u2019s decision as to admissibility of evidence only if the appellant sustains the \u201cheavy burden\u201d to show that the trial court has abused its discretion. Id. at 1140; see also Flor, supra at 623, 634. We have explained the abuse of discretion standard as follows:\nIt is not sufficient to persuade the appellate court that it might have reached a different conclusion^] it is necessary to show an actual abuse of the discretionary power. An abuse of discretion will not be found based on a mere error of judgment, but rather exists where the court has reached a conclusion [that] overrides or misapplies the law, or where the judgment exercised is manifestly unreasonable, or the result of partiality, prejudice, bias or ill-will.\nEichinger, supra at 1140.\nHere, during the victim impact portion of its case, the Commonwealth called four witnesses: Daisy Pough, grandmother of Chante Wright, who after Ms. Wright\u2019s death, assumed the responsibility for raising her then six-year-old son; Kathleen Webb, mother of Octavia Green, who had custody of and was raising Ms. Green\u2019s son and daughter, then seven- and four-years-old, respectively; Markeyia Sorden, sister of Ms. Wright; and Michael Green, father of Ms. Green. N.T., 4/28/10, at 54-77. None of the three children of the victims testified. However, during Ms. Webb\u2019s testimony concerning her grandchildren\u2019s response to their mother\u2019s death, one photograph of each of the two children was shown briefly to the jury. Id. at 61-62.\nWe cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by briefly showing the jury a photograph of each of Ms. Green\u2019s two young children during their grandmother/caretaker\u2019s victim impact testimony concerning the effect of their mother\u2019s murder on their behavior. Because the children did not testify themselves, their photographs constituted the only means by which the Commonwealth could show the jury those individuals who were arguably most affected by Appellant\u2019s offense, and thus put a human face on the harm it caused. We cannot conclude that this was an abuse of discretion.\nALLEGED PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT DURING CLOSING ARGUMENT\nIn Appellant\u2019s third and final issue, he alleges \u201crepeated and deliberate\u201d prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument, and he seeks, as remedy, a new trial. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 21. During the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, defense counsel raised several objections that the trial court sustained. At the end of the argument, defense counsel moved for a mistrial based on the \u201cseriousness\u201d of the sustained objections. N.T., 5/4/10, at 173. The trial court denied Appellant\u2019s motion, reasoning that the objections had been sustained and the prosecutor cautioned \u201cto move along.\u201d Id. In its opinion, the trial court held that any prejudice generated by the challenged remarks was \u201cameliorated\u201d by the court\u2019s sustaining of the objections, and furthermore, that, even if the defense objections had not been sustained, no relief was due \u201cbecause the [prosecutor\u2019s] remarks were not so egregious so as to deny [Appellant] a fair penalty hearing.\u201d Trial Court Opinion at 9. Before this Court, Appellant claims that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based on four sustained objections to the prosecutor\u2019s statements during closing argument.\nAppellant specifically raises the following four allegations of prosecutorial misconduct during closing argument: (a) comments concerning Appellant\u2019s lack of remorse; (b) an incorrect recitation of Ms. Kinney\u2019s testimony; (c) a statement that the Commonwealth did not have sufficient funds to protect a witness in a state witness relocation program; (d) comparison of Appellant\u2019s sentence to the sentence imposed on Hakeem Bey. Before addressing each of these subclaims, we summarize the well-established legal standard for prosecutorial misconduct.\nComments by a prosecutor constitute reversible error only where their unavoidable effect is to prejudice the jury, forming in [the jurors\u2019] minds a fixed bi\u00e1s and hostility toward the defendant such that they could not weigh the evidence objectively and render a fair verdict.\nCommonwealth v. Hutchinson, 611 Pa. 280, 25 A.3d 277, 307 (2011) (citation omitted).\nWhile it is improper for a prosecutor to offer any personal opinion as to guilt of the defendant or credibility of the witnesses, it is entirely proper for the prosecutor to summarize the evidence presented, to offer reasonable deductions and inferences from the evidence, and to argue that the evidence establishes the defendant\u2019s guilt. Id. at 306-07; Commonwealth v. Chamberlain, 612 Pa. 107, 30 A.3d 381, 408 (2011). In addition, the prosecutor must be allowed to respond to defense counsel\u2019s arguments, and any challenged statement must be viewed not in isolation, but in the context in which it was offered. Hutchinson, supra at 307. \u201c[The] prosecutor must be free to present his or her arguments with logical force and vigor.\u201d Id. at 306-07 (citation omitted). Within reasonable bounds, the prosecutor may employ oratorical flair and impassioned argument when commenting on the evidence or presenting the case for imposition of the death penalty. Commonwealth v. Paddy, 609 Pa. 272, 15 A.3d 431, 458-59 (2011).\nIt is also well established that \u201c[a] trial court may grant a mistrial only where the incident upon which the motion is based is of such a nature that its unavoidable effect is to deprive the defendant of a fair trial by preventing the jury from weighing and rendering a true verdict.\u201d Chamberlain, supra at 422 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Commonwealth v. Travaglia, 611 Pa. 481, 28 A.3d 868, 879 (2011) (\u201cA mistrial is an extreme remedy that is required only where the challenged event deprived the accused of a fair and impartial trial.\u201d). When the trial court gives adequate cautionary instructions, declaration of a mistrial is not necessary. Chamberlain, supra. In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a mistrial, our standard is abuse of discretion. Id.; Travaglia, supra; Commonwealth v. Gease, 548 Pa. 165, 696 A.2d 130, 134 (1997) (stating that when we review a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct, our standard is abuse of discretion); see text supra for delineation of abuse of discretion standard.\nIn Appellant\u2019s first subclaim under this issue, he challenges the prosecutor\u2019s comments about his lack of remorse. The specific comments are as follows, placed in proper context.\nProsecutor: You will hear them say remorse because [Appellant] pled guilty. Well, you heard this case. All his girls gave him up. His fingerprint gave him up. His DNA gave him up. The cell phone records gave him up. His confession gave him up.\nWhen you were picked here, remember it was for a trial. Remember that? You had to decide guilt or innocence. But when I found everybody, and I mean it, when I had you and he looks and going, wow, I don\u2019t think I can pull the wool over their eyes, it was not, I\u2019m sorry, I have remorse. It is, I give up, I surrender, you got me, you can\u2019t beat me, so let me go to plan B. I mil say I am guilty, and that\u2019s remorse. Have you seen any sorrow, any apology in this man?\nDefense Counsel: Objection.\nThe Court: Sustained.\nProsecutor: I say, when they say remorse that he pled guilty, no. That was, I surrender, you got me cold. I can\u2019t beat you.\nN.T., 5/4/10, at 135 (closing argument) (emphasis added to that portion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument quoted in Appellant\u2019s Brief at 22-23).\nProsecutor: And [Appellant] tells about the murder. But as a stand-up, strong guy,, because he is part of this crew, I did it all. She is not a witness against me, but I killed her anyway. I don\u2019t know Hakeem Bey. But you heard Aisha, they went to school together. I don\u2019t know Hakeem Bey, but I called his phone a whole bunch of times. I did it all and I don\u2019t know why. [Appellant] is keeping them clear. I know there was money to kill [Chante Wright]. Think of that. Chante knew people wanted to kill her. There was a price on her head. And he keeps them out of it.\nSo when you think of remorse? You heard testimony, Hakeem Bey and Malik Bennett have not been arrested for killing those girls. Those cell phones, you know for a fact, without a doubt, that was a planning, let\u2019s do it, do it and here is your money. But I can\u2019t lock them up. They can\u2019t lock them up. Who can tell us about those phone calls? Remorse? I\u2019m sorry?\nDefense Counsel: Objection.\nThe Court: Objection sustained. Move on.\nProsecutor: [Appellant] takes the blame for everything and keeps his personality.\nId. at 158-59 (closing argument) (emphasis added to that portion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument quoted in Appellant\u2019s Brief at 23).\nAppellant asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s comments about lack of remorse were \u201ccertainly\u201d an attempt \u201cto generate bias and hostility in the jurors\u201d because Appellant had demonstrated \u201cexquisite remorse\u201d by confessing to a homicide detective and then pleading guilty to two counts of first-degree murder in open court. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 22. The Commonwealth argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comments concerning lack of remorse were appropriately made in anticipation of the defense argument that Appellant showed his remorse by pleading guilty. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 39-40.\nAlthough the trial court granted the defense objections to the above remarks, the court refused to grant a mistrial. In its opinion, the trial court clarified that it had sustained the defense objection because the prosecutor was expressing his personal opinion as to Appellant\u2019s lack of remorse, not because the prosecutor was arguing that Appellant lacked remorse. Trial Court Opinion at 9-10 n.2. As the trial court recognized, a prosecutor is permitted to address a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse. Id. at 9 (quoting Commonwealth v. Rivera, 565 Pa. 289, 773 A.2d 131, 141 (2001) for the proposition that the Commonwealth may argue at the penalty phase \u201cthat a defendant showed no sympathy or remorse, so long as it is not an extensive tirade\u201d), and also (citing Commonwealth v. Chester, 526 Pa. 578, 587 A.2d 1367, 1378 (1991) for the proposition that a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse could be relevant to the jury\u2019s assessment of the presence of any mitigating factors). The trial court concluded that because the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not lengthy or extensive and Appellant had indeed shown no remorse during the penalty phase, the challenged comments did not warrant the grant of a mistrial, i.e., they did not deprive Appellant of a fair and impartial trial. Id. at 8-9.\nWe conclude that the trial court\u2019s ruling did not constitute an abuse of its discretion. We note only that, consistent with the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, defense counsel had strongly and repeatedly argued in his opening statement to the jury that Appellant\u2019s guilty pleas in open court revealed his remorse, sorrow, regret, and acceptance of responsibility. The prosecutor\u2019s challenged comments suggested to the jury an alternative prism through which to consider and assess Appellant\u2019s confession and guilty pleas. Appellant is entitled to no relief on his first subclaim.\nIn Appellant\u2019s second subclaim under this issue, he challenges the following excerpt of the Commonwealth\u2019s closing argument.\nProsecutor: When Appellant first gets in there, he is strong. They hit him with we got your fingerprints. I don\u2019t know how that got there. But you were around there. No, no, I wasn\u2019t there, I was somewhere else. Smart, thinking. Finally, when they are going to leave, Aisha [Kinney, Appellant\u2019s girlfriend and the mother of his daughter] told [Appellant] something when they said let him talk. What thing did she tell him? Basically, baby, you are on your own, I gave you up, you are on your own, baby, I\u2019m out.\nDefense Counsel: Objection, Your Honor.\nCourt: Objection sustained. It is the jury\u2019s recollection.\nObjection sustained.\nN.T., 5/4/10, at 157 (closing argument) (quoted in Appellant\u2019s Brief at 27-28).\nAppellant contends that with the above-quoted comment the prosecutor did not merely misstate the evidence, but rather \u201cmade it up.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 28. Appellant finds nothing in the record to support the prosecutor\u2019s comment that Ms. Kinney told Appellant that she \u201cgave [him] up\u201d to the police and he was \u201con [his] own.\u201d Id. Rather, Appellant suggests that \u201cthe record only reflected that [Ms. Kinney] may have encouraged [Appellant] to do the right thing\u201d and tell the truth. Id. at 27-28. Appellant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement constituted \u201cdeliberate misrepresentations,\u201d and therefore the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial. Id. at 29.\nThe Commonwealth argues that, to the extent the prosecutor\u2019s characterization of Ms. Kinney\u2019s conversation with Appellant may be disputable, the trial court cured any resulting prejudice by immediately sustaining the defense objection and instructing the jurors that their recollection controlled. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 42-43 (quoting Commonwealth v. Wesley, 562 Pa. 7, 753 A.2d 204, 209 (2000), for the proposition that \u201cprompt and effective curative instructions may remove prejudice resulting from improper comments by a prosecutor\u201d).\nThe trial court declined to grant a mistrial, concluding that the prosecutor had not misstated the evidence, but had only paraphrased the totality of Ms. Kinney\u2019s testimony. Trial Court Opinion at 10. Although we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial, we also must note that the record does not entirely comport with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of the prosecutor\u2019s comment for the reasons discussed below.\nMs. Kinney testified for the Commonwealth, strongly implicating Appellant in the murders and disassociating herself from his actions. At trial, Ms. Kinney\u2019s testimony established the following: Appellant had a revolver; Appellant told her on the night of the murders that he was going to \u201cmeet up\u201d with Ms. Wright to smoke some \u201cwet;\u201d Appellant did not return to Ms. Kinney\u2019s home until 8:00 or 9:00 the next morning; after hearing about the murders on the news, Ms. Kinney was afraid to ask Appellant about what had happened to Ms. Wright; days after the murders, Appellant told Ms. Kinney to burn the jacket that he had worn the night of the murders because it had blood on it, but she did not do as he asked because there was \u201cjust something wrong\u201d that she did not \u201cwant to be involved in;\u201d and Appellant offered to give her $1,000 for some of her expenses, although he did not have a job and he said that he needed a ride to go and pick up his money. N.T., 4/22/10, at 29-45, 49-52. Ms. Kinney also testified that Appellant and Hakeem Bey had gone to school together, testimony that arguably contradicted Appellant\u2019s statement to police that he did not know Bey and had never spoken to him. Id. at 41; N.T., 4/28/10, at 36. Finally, Ms. Kinney testified that she had visited Appellant only once after he was imprisoned, at which time he told her to take back the incriminating statements she had given to police and say they were lies. N.T., 4/22/10, at 43-44. She refused and did not see Appellant again, explaining as follows:\nI just didn\u2019t go see him after that. I have kids. Like, I don\u2019t, you know, get involved in this. Like, you know, you do what you do, you got to serve your time. Don\u2019t try to drag somebody else into it that don\u2019t have nothing to do with it. And, like, I really hate him for what he did, like my kids is going through things.\nId. at 44.\nThus, the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the prosecutor\u2019s comments merely paraphrased Ms. Kinney\u2019s trial testimony is consistent with the record of the entirety of her testimony. However, a close reading of the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the context of the notes of testimony reveals that the prosecutor was referring not to Ms. Kinney\u2019s testimony before the court, but rather to what Ms. Kinney had said to Appellant at the police station just before he gave his inculpatory statement to police. What Ms. Kinney said to Appellant at the station was developed at trial not by Ms. Kinney\u2019s testimony, but by the testimony of two detectives investigating the case, as follows. When Appellant was in custody, the detectives permitted him and Ms. Kinney to speak privately for a few minutes. The words that passed between them are a matter of speculation, except for the end of their conversation, which Detective John Harkins testified that he overheard. Specifically, Detective Harkins testified that Appellant asked Ms. Kinney what she wanted him to do and she told him to tell the truth. N.T., 4/28/10, at 48. Shortly thereafter, Appellant gave his inculpatory statement to the detectives. See id.; N.T., 4/23/10, at 119-20.\nThus, the prosecutor\u2019s comments concerning specifically what Ms. Kinney told Appellant during this mostly private conversation were not consistent with the testimony presented at trial. However, as discussed above, the trial court sustained defense counsel\u2019s immediate objection, and then instructed the jurors that their recollection of the evidence was the recollection that mattered. Given the trial court\u2019s sustaining of the objection and its immediate instruction to the jury, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial. Appellant is entitled to no relief.\nIn Appellant\u2019s third subclaim under this issue, he challenges certain statements made by the prosecutor concerning Ms. Wright\u2019s fear of testifying against Hakeem Bey, the resulting inability of the Commonwealth to bring Bey to justice promptly for the 2000 murder of Moses Williams, and the failures and funding problems of the state witness relocation program. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 24-27. The background to this claim is as follows.\nThe following evidence concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecution of Hakeem Bey for the murder of Moses Williams, and Ms. Wright\u2019s role therein, was presented at Appellant\u2019s trial to show the history and circumstances of the case and to establish the aggravating circumstance of killing in retaliation against a witness, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(15). Ms. Wright had disappeared prior to Bey\u2019s first scheduled trial in April 2004 for Williams\u2019s murder because she was too frightened to testify, resulting in the murder charges against Bey being nolle prossed. N.T., 4/22/10, at 55-66. Ms. Wright had refused to enter a state witness relocation program because her safety, and that of her family, could not be guaranteed. Id. at 61-62. Therefore, the Commonwealth\u2019s prosecution of Bey for Williams\u2019s murder was delayed for years, and was reinstituted only after Ms. Wright had entered a federal witness protection program in 2007. Id. at 63-65. Bey was rearrested for Williams\u2019s murder and was scheduled to be tried in March 2008, approximately two months after Appellant murdered Ms. Wright and Ms. Green. Id. at 66.\nIn the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, he mentioned some of this history of the Bey prosecution and Ms. Wright\u2019s role in it, as follows.\nProsecutor: You heard Ms. Cahill, Ms. Armstrong, getting paid by us for their expertise. Whatever they bill, we pay. But my office doesn\u2019t have enough money to hide a girl properly to keep her alive. And when she says, I can\u2019t, I am not going in your protective program because I am not safe in it, and you know it, I knew it, and he knew it, and at which point you make a hard call and say, I can\u2019t bring this case, I cannot bring justice\u2014\nDefense Counsel: Judge, I object to this.\nCourt: Yes. Move on. Objection sustained.\nProsecutor: We could not bring the case forward. A decision made. It is not legal, it is a moral thing. I will not jeopardize this witness. I cannot assure that she will see another day.\nN.T., 5/4/10, at 146-47 (closing argument) (footnote added) (quoted in Appellant\u2019s Brief at 24-25,27).\nAppellant claims that the above comments amounted to a suggestion to the jury that he should be sentenced to death to \u201cright the \u2022wrong of a failed criminal justice system ... so that society could receive justice in the end.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 25. The Commonwealth asserts that the prosecutor was merely commenting on evidence presented at trial concerning Ms. Wright\u2019s identification of Hakeem Bey as the killer of Moses Williams. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 41. The trial court acknowledged that the prosecutor\u2019s statement about the inadequacies of the state witness protection program and its failure to protect the victim was \u201cpoorly phrased;\u201d however, the trial court concluded that the statement was not overtly prejudicial and could not have prevented the jury from rendering a fair verdict. Trial Court Opinion at 10 (holding that the challenged comment \u201cwas not so prejudicial as to require a mistrial\u201d).\nWe conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial. Although the prosecutor\u2019s comments contrasting the payment of defense expert witnesses with the inadequate funding of the state witness relocation program were problematic and not relevant, the trial court sustained the defense objection to the remarks and directed the prosecutor to move on. There was no abuse of discretion in the trial court\u2019s determination that the challenged remarks were not so prejudicial as to require the extreme remedy of a mistrial.\nIn Appellant\u2019s fourth and final claim of prosecutorial misconduct, he challenges the following comments concerning the life sentence imposed on Hakeem Bey for the murder of Moses Williams.\nProsecutor: You are going to hear Hakeem got life. Yeah. When she was dead, we made a decision, now I am that DA, we are going to go to trial. And, man, it is going to be a bumpy ride. But you know what? Let\u2019s go. Because, you know what? You silenced her, but we are going forward. And the jury sat there and said, you know what? You killed Moses. You killed him beyond a reasonable doubt. And they gave him life. That\u2019s right. And the jury didn\u2019t have before you what you have, three aggravators. The only aggravator they had was endangerment of others, that somebody got placed in danger because he fired the shot. Remember bullets travel? And nobody got hurt. And they don\u2019t know everything that happened, so that was the only aggravator.\nDefense Counsel: Objection.\nCourt: Sustained. Not relevant to this case. Move on, [ ].\nProsecutor: Malik Bennett. Tough decision. You know what? We are not a hundred percent, but we are going forward. Bang, he got convicted on his murder, serving life.\nN.T., 5/4/10, at 164-65 (closing argument) (quoted in Appellant\u2019s Brief at 29).\nThe specific grounds upon which the defense objected to the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not elucidated; however, the notes of testimony make clear that the trial court sustained the objection on the basis of relevance. Here, Appellant\u2019s argument is brief, but is focused on his assertion that the life sentence imposed on Hakeem Bey for the murder of Moses Williams was not relevant to the jury\u2019s deliberations regarding Appellant\u2019s sentence for the murders of Ms. Wright and Ms. Green. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 29 (\u201cWhether Bey received life or death had no Rule 401 relevant effect on what should have transpired during the jury\u2019s deliberations in this case.\u201d). The Commonwealth points out that the defense, during re-cross-examination of one of the investigating detectives, elicited testimony that Hakeem Bey and Malik Bennett were each serving a life sentence for another murder. Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 44-45 (citing N.T., 4/28/10, at 45-46). In the Commonwealth\u2019s view, the prosecutor\u2019s comments in closing argument were proper because he was anticipating a defense argument that because Bey had received a life sentence, so should Appellant. Id.\nIn its opinion, the trial court agreed with the Commonwealth that the prosecutor was merely anticipating a defense argument when he argued-that the jury should not be swayed by the fact that Hakeem Bey had received a life sentence for the murder of Moses Williams. Trial Court Opinion at 10-11. Accordingly, because \u201c[tjhere was nothing improper in [the prosecutor\u2019s] argument,\u201d the trial court held that Appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was properly denied. Id. at 11.\nThe trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. Our review of the certified record reveals that the entire matter of whether and how Bey\u2019s life sentence could be mentioned in the defense closing argument was raised at an in-chambers conference the same day as closing arguments, as follows.\nProsecutor: I don\u2019t want [defense counsel] discussing Malik Bennett\u2019s murders, what their sentence was that they got.\nDefense Counsel: Malik Bennett?\nProsecutor: Malik Bennett and Hakeem Bey, that they received life.\nDefense Counsel: It came in without objection.\nCourt: I think it is in evidence.\nProsecutor: ... it is in because it is the procedural history of those cases. But [Bey and Bennett] weren\u2019t charged with this crime. I think the point is, they shouldn\u2019t be able to argue something along the lines of those other guys were involved and they didn\u2019t get death, so neither should he.\nCourt: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what they are going to argue.\nDefense Counsel: I will certainly mention the fact that Bey is doing life. I am not going to say \u2014 make the comparative justice argument.\nCourt: So long as you don\u2019t do that, he can make reference to the life sentence.\nProsecutor: Should he, then it will be limited to a three-minute surrebuttal then since he violated what he has just said.\nCourt: You can object and I will instruct the jury if that occurs, if [defense counsel] goes beyond that.\nDefense Counsel: I will say Hakeem Bey is doing life.\nN.T., 5/4/10, at 8-10 (in-chambers conference) (emphasis added).\nThus, based on defense counsel\u2019s own words, it is clear that the prosecutor could have reasonably anticipated that defense counsel would mention Bey\u2019s life sentence in his closing argument. As the trial court recognized, a prosecutor, as well as defense counsel, may reasonably anticipate arguments of his or her opponent and respond accordingly. See Trial Court Opinion at 10; Hutchinson, 25 A.3d at 307 (\u201c[T]he prosecution must be permitted to respond to defense counsel\u2019s arguments.\u201d); Commonwealth v. Marrero, 546 Pa. 596, 687 A.2d 1102, 1109 (1996) (concluding that a prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing argument concerning the possibility of commutation were \u201ca fair response to defense counsel\u2019s anticipated argument that a life sentence meant that [the] appellant would spend his entire life in prison\u201d). The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant a mistrial.\nFinally, pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3), we must review a sentence of death and affirm, unless we determine that\n(i) the sentence of death was the product of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor; or\n(ii) the evidence fails to support the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance specified in subsection (d).\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(3).\nFollowing our thorough review of the facts and the record, we conclude that the sentence of death was not the result of \u201cpassion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor,\u201d but rather was based on the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence admitted at trial. Id. In addition, we conclude that the evidence admitted at trial was sufficient \u201cto support the finding of at least one aggravating circumstance.\u201d Id. Indeed, the evidence was sufficient to support the finding of all three aggravating circumstances. With regard to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(ll), convicted of another murder, Appellant pled guilty to the first-degree murder of both Ms. Wright and Ms. Green. With regard to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(15), killing in retaliation against a witness, the evidence was sufficient to establish that Ms. Wright was a witness for the Commonwealth against Hakeem Bey and that Appellant murdered her at the behest of Bey to prevent her from testifying. With regard to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(2), paid by another person for the killing of the victim, the testimony of several witnesses established that Appellant was going to be paid for murdering Ms. Wright.\nThe verdict and sentence of death are hereby affirmed.\nFormer Justice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE, Justice EAKIN and BAER and Justice TODD join the opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\n. In some documents of record, Chante Wright is referred to as Chante Jackson. See, e.g., Trial Court Opinion, dated 5/13/2011, at 1 n. 1. Chante Jackson was the name provided to Chante Wright when she entered the federal witness relocation program and was relocated to Florida.\n. Respectively 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2502(a), 4952(a)(1), 6105(a)(1), 907(a).\n. The jury specifically cited as mitigating factors under subsection 9711(e)(8) Appellant\u2019s life circumstances, including his drug use, his cognitive deficiencies, and the home/neighborhood environment into which he was born. See Sentencing Verdict Slips at 5; Notes of Testimony (\"N.T.\u201d), 5/5/10, at 9 and 13.\n. \"A sentence of death shall be subject to automatic review by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania pursuant to its rules.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(1).\n. Appellant also pled guilty to intimidation of a witness and firearms charges. N.T., 4/21/10, at 33-34. These charges are not at issue here.\n. During the penalty-phase hearing, the Commonwealth presented the evidence that it had summarized in its proffer during the guilty plea. See N.T., 4/26/10, at 48-75 (testimony of Dr. Collins who performed autopsies on the victims); N.T., 4/21/10, at 85-89 (testimony of Officer Christopher Leaiy, who responded to the call of a shooting and discovered the victims\u2019 bodies); N.T., 4/23/10, at 50-105 (Assigned Detective John Verrecchio's testimony regarding where the victims were shot and also regarding the recovery of the cell phones and analysis of the cell phone records); Id. at 42 and N.T., 4/21/10, at 116, 122 (testimony and counsel\u2019s stipulation as to the presence and location of Appellant\u2019s fingerprint on the vehicle involved in the murder); N.T., 4/22/10, at 57, 63-66, and N.T., 4/23/10, at 58, 81 (testimony as to Ms. Wright's participation in the federal witness protection program and her planned testimony against Hakeem Bey); N.T., 4/23/10, at 160-62 (Agent Shute's testimony as to the location of Appellant's cell phone around the time of the murders); N.T., 4/26/10, at 9-17 (testimony of Denise Wilson); N.T., 4/23/10, at 11-13, 21-28 (testimony of Jahmeia Harrell); and N.T., 4/22/10, at 29-30, 33-36, 41-42 (testimony of Aisha Kinney).\n. The defense had previously introduced Appellant\u2019s inculpatory statement into evidence during cross-examination of the detective assigned to this case in order to show Appellant\u2019s early remorse and acceptance of responsibility. See N.T., 4/23/10, at 119-23 (introducing Appellant\u2019s statement and questioning the witness about it to make the point that Appellant had waived his rights when he gave his statement of confession).\n. During the suppression hearing, the defense also argued that Appellant had been arrested without probable cause. The trial court rejected this argument after considering all the evidence that police investigators had uncovered linking Appellant to the victims and the scene of the murders. See N.T., 3/30/10, at 56, 62-65. The question of probable cause for arrest is not at issue in this appeal.\n. In Appellant\u2019s statement of the question presented in Issue 2, he challenges the admission of \"extremely inflammatory and prejudicial photographs of the victim, living at that time.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 3 (Questions Presented, Question II) (emphasis added); see also Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18 (in the title of the argument section for Issue 2, challenging \"certain inflammatory photographs of the victim, while alive\u201d) (emphasis added). However, in his discussion of this issue, Appellant does not mention any photographs of the victims, and our review of the record reveals no indication that any photographs of the victims were admitted into evidence or shown to the jury.\nIn fact, the record shows that the trial court refused to admit a photograph of one of the victims, Ms. Green, with her son seated on her lap. With this photograph, the Commonwealth had sought to show the jury \"a visual of what Ms. Green looks like,\u201d but the trial court denied the Commonwealth\u2019s request. N.T., 4/28/10, at 49.\nBefore this Court, Appellant specifically challenges only two photographs, Commonwealth Exhibits 74 and 75 (C-74 and C-75), which are photographs of Ms. Green's son and daughter, respectively. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 18, 20. In his brief, Appellant does not challenge a photograph of Ms. Wright\u2019s young son, which was made a part of the record with counsel's stipulation just before closing arguments began. N.T., 5/4/10, at 119-20 (entering the photograph of Ms. Wright\u2019s son into the record as Commonwealth Exhibit 79). Defense counsel did not object to the admission of this photograph. Furthermore, as the Commonwealth points out, it is unclear from the record whether this photograph was ever shown to the jury. See Commonwealth\u2019s Brief at 31 n. 8.\n. Appellant\u2019s subclaims have been reordered for ease of disposition.\n. Defense counsel\u2019s opening argument included the following statements related to Appellant's alleged feelings of remorse.\nThe first words that you [the jury] heard from [Appellant] were \"guilty\u201d to every charge that the Commonwealth threw at him____ I was struck ... at how routine that seemed....\nThe first thing that you need to realize about that apparently routine moment is what it really means for us, for you, each of you as individuals what that means.\nWhat you saw in that brief moment was someone accepting responsibility for what he has done. He\u2019s not here to fight, evade, deny, nothing. He's here to step up and say, Yeah, all those things you just heard, yes, I did it.\nBut it means even more than that. It\u2019s his way \u2014 all he can do is admit- \u2014 it's his way of expressing his remorse, his sorrow, his regret, for what happened.\nBut it\u2019s something else. The two charges that he pled guilty to, those first two murders, carried life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, mandatory. No judge, no appeal, no lawyer here, there, eveiywhere, can do anything about it. He has stepped up and accepted, without a fight, that he will die in prison.\nN.T., 4/21/10, at 70-72 (defense opening argument).\nLet me end where I began, that almost routine moment at the beginning of this trial, he has come to you not after a big fight and denials and phoney [sic] alibis or anything like that. At this point, he stood up to you, in front of you, and said, I accept responsibility for what I have done. I know that means I would die in prison. I know that is likely to be 50 years from now. I accept that penance. I accept that punishment, but I say to you that I would prove to you that he\u2019s not so evil, debased, and without worth that he must die.\nId. at 82 (defense opening argument).\n. Immediately after this testimony, defense counsel objected and the court sustained the objection. N.T., 4/22/10, at 44. Neither the basis for the objection nor the reason for the court\u2019s ruling was set forth. The objection is not at issue in this appeal.\n. After the Wright and Green murders, Bey was brought to trial for the murder of Moses Williams, convicted, and sentenced to life in prison. N.T., 4/22/10, at 68.\n. Ms. Cahill and Ms. Armstrong are, respectively a mitigation specialist and a neuropsychologist who testified on behalf of Appellant at trial. See N.T., 5/3/10, at 9-108; N.T., 5/4/10, at 10-78.\n. We note that there was no evidence linking Appellant to Ms. Wright\u2019s fear of testifying against Bey, her decision not to enter a state witness relocation program, or the delay in bringing Bey to justice for the murder of Williams.\n. Marrero was an Opinion Announcing the Judgment of the Court, but all four justices deciding the case joined this portion of the Opinion.\n. The Prothonotary of the Supreme Court is directed to transmit the complete record of this case to the Governor of Pennsylvania. See 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 971 l(i)."}
