{"id": "972711", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThis was an appeal from the order of the court below opening the decree of confirmation, and setting aside a sale of real estate made in pursuance of an order of sale. ' We have said so often that this is a matter within the discretion of the Orphans\u2019 Court that it seems unnecessary to repeat it. \" It follows that no appeal lies. We find no such abuse of discretion in this case as would justify us in departing from the rule.\nAppeal quashed."}
