{"id": "1913498", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nPlaintiff (appellee) brought a trespass action for personal injuries arising out of an automobile collision on South River Street in Wilkes-Barre on June 6, 1960. Plaintiff claimed that his automobile while stopped on River Street was hit from the rear by defendant Lamp-man\u2019s vehicle, which was being driven by his agent, Mackiewicz. After plaintiff had been examined, not by one but by two of his physicians, and had been advised by them of the injuries he sustained and of the prognosis, he agreed to settle for $350, and in consideration of the payment of this sum a release, under seal, was entered into and executed by all the parties, namely, by plaintiff and by the agent of the defendants. The release, dated July 22, 1960, is so important that it will be quoted at some length:\n\u201cRelease in Full\n\u201cKnow All Men By These Presents, That I, Robert W. Emery, for the sole consideration of three hundred and fifty dollars and 00/100 Dollars, to me in hand paid by Louis Lampman, Joseph J. Mackiewicz have released and discharged, and by these presents do for myself, my heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, release and forever discharge the said Louis Lampman, Joseph J. Mackiewicz and all other persons, firms or corporations from all claims, demands, damages, actions, or causes of action, on account of damage to property, bodily injuries or death, resulting, or to result, from an accident to--which occurred on or about the 6th day of June, 1960, by reason of accident on South River St., Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and of and for all claims or demands whatsoever in law or in equity, which I, my heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns can, shall or may have by reason of any matter, cause or thing whatsoever prior to, the date hereof.\n\u201cIt Is Understood ' And Agreed That this is a full and final release of all claims of every nature and kind whatsoever, and releases claims that are known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected.\n\u201cIn Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and seal this 22 day of July, 1960.\n(s) Robert W. Emery (Seal)\n125 N. Atherton St.\nKingston, Pa.\nIn the Presence Of:\n(s) Michael Chup, Jr.\u201d\nOn August 15, 1961, over a year after plaintiff had signed the above-recited, release, plaintiff commenced his present action of trespass to recover for injuries allegedly sustained in the aforesaid automobile accident on June 6, 1960. Defendants in their answer denied liability and pleaded the release as a complete defense. Plaintiff in his \u201creply to new matter\u201d alleged that the release was executed while the parties' were laboring under a \u201cmutual mistake of fact\u201d as to his injuries. Defendants then moved for a summary judgment, which was denied.\nPlaintiff was examined on several occasions by Dr. Joseph P. Chollak and by Dr. L. W. Jones during the period between the accident and the execution of the above-recited release. Plaintiff\u2019s doctors, Dr. Jones and Dr. Chollak (who went into greater detail) testified that at the time the release was executed by the plaintiff, he was of the opinion and so informed the plaintiff that the injuries which plaintiff had suffered, consisted of a muscle strain in the area of the neck, and that a month and a half later he discovered plaintiff had a rupture of a disc and that this constituted a \u201cseparate injury\u201d from his neck muscle injuries. Defendants (a) brought out on cross-examination that plaintiff himself was a physical therapist and was experienced in muscle building and structure and human anatomy, and (b) then produced medical evidence that' the rupture of the disc was a consequence of the injuries in plaintiff\u2019s neck region, and not a separate injury in itself. Both doctors further testified that plaintiff\u2019s ball playing subsequent to the accident caused the severe pain in plaintiff\u2019s neck and disc.\nAt the conclusion of the jury trial, the trial Judge rejected defendants\u2019 request for binding instructions, and in his charge directed the jury to make special findings on several issues.\nThe jury did not bring in a verdict of the amount of damages suffered by the plaintiff, but merely made a number of special findings. The jury specially found that at the time of the execution of the above-mentioned release, plaintiff believed his only injuries were injuries to his neck and that plaintiff and defendants alike were ignorant of the existence of injury to one of plaintiff\u2019s invertebral discs. The jury further specially found that this disc injury was \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d from the injuries to plaintiff\u2019s neck muscles, and that it was caused by the accident. From the judgment entered on the special verdict, defendants took this appeal.\nWe need not and do not decide (1) whether the verdict of the jury was against the weight of the evidence, or (2) whether plaintiff\u2019s doctors w\u00e9re negligent in not previously discovering and advising plaintiff of the disc injury which they subsequently discovered. We ne\u00e9d not decide these questions because the above-recited release, which plaintiff executed, bars his recovery and requires the entry of a judgment n.o.v.\nThe above-quoted general and specific release of all claims, demands and actions for bodily injuries could not possibly be clearer or more specific, or more completely all-inclusive and all-embracing. There was no fraud or duress or deception by defendants, and plaintiff was advised by and relied upon his own doctors\u2019 diagnosis of his injuries. This particular release was not only general and specific as to the accident but, we repeat, it released the defendants \u201cfrom all claims, demands, damages [and] actions ... on account of . . . bodily injuries or death resulting or to result from [this] accident ... of every nature and kvnd whatsoever, and releases claims that are known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected.\u201d If such a release can be nullified or circumvented, then every written release and every written contract or agreement of any kind, no matter how clear and pertinent and all-inclusive, can be set aside whenever one of the parties has a change of mind or whenever there subsequently occurs \u00e1 change of circumstances which were unforeseen, or there were after-discovered injuries, or the magnitude of a releasor\u2019s injuries was unexpectedly increased, or plaintiff made an inadequate settlement. It would make a mockery of the English language and of the Law to permit this release to be circumvented or held to be nugatory.\nWe have reviewed all the pertinent authorities cited and all the contentions made by plaintiff and find none of them are apposite or aid the plaintiff.\nJudgment reversed, and judgment is here entered for defendants non obstante veredicto.\nMr. Justice Cohen and Mr. Justice Eagen concur in the result.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents.\nMr. Justice Jones took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nItalics throughout, ours."}
