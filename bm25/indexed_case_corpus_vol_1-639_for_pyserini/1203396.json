{"id": "1203396", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Schaffer,\nWas the service upon the additional defendant, a nonresident, valid? The court below held not. The original defendant, who endeavored to bring in the additional one, appeals.\nA collision occurred in Montgomery County between the automobile of defendant and that of the additional defendant, who is a resident of the State of North Carolina. Plaintiff was riding in original defendant\u2019s car. She brought suit against him in Philadelphia, where he resides. By petition under Pa. B. C. P. No. 2252, 332 Pa. exxiii, he seeks to bring in the additional defendant. The court below made an order joining the additional defendant. Process was served on the Secretary of Bevenue, as the Act of May 14, 1929, P. L. 1721, See. 2, as amended, 75 PS Sec. 1202, permits. Notice, as provided by the act, was given to the additional defendant. She filed a special appearance and a petition under the Act of March 5, 1925, P. L. 23, 12 PS Sec. 672, to set the service aside. We think under the circumstances it was invalid.\nIt is not necessary to review all the cases referred to in the briefs. Most of them have already been considered in Williams v. Meredith, 326 Pa. 570, 192 A. 924, which answers the question now submitted to us. It holds that the right of service of process on a nonresident defendant, in a motor vehicle case, under the Act of 1929, supra, as amended, exists only Avhere suit has been instituted in the county in which the accident occurred. There we pointed out that, giving to plaintiffs, in automobile cases, an unrestricted choice of venue against nonresidents, with the right to serve defendant by deputation, no matter where he may be, is incompatible in right, with such suits against residents, who can be served by deputation, only if the suit is instituted in the county where the accident occurred. We said (p. 574) we could \u201cnot assume that the legislature intended to sweep away all the protection accorded to nonresidents by the common laAV rules, and lift all these restrictions and expose them to suit in any county in the state irrespective of where the accident occurred, Avhile suit against a resident for a similar accident must be in the county where it took place or where personal service can be made on the defendant. To create a different rule for nonresidents might give rise to a very serious constitutional question.\u201d\nIt is argued by the original defendant and by plaintiff that Pa. R. C. P. No. 2254, 332 Pa. cxxvii, authorizes the service. The rule provides that \u201cA defendant shall have the same rights in securing service as the plaintiff had for service in said action. If the action was instituted in the county where the cause of action arose, . . . the defendant shall also have the right of service in any other county by having the sheriff of the county wherein the action was instituted deputize the sheriff of any other county wherein service may be had.\u201d No provision is made for service outside the State. Gossard v. Gossard, 319 Pa. 129, 178 A. 837, does not support appellant\u2019s position as a close reading of the opinion will show. We were there considering service on an additional defendant \u201cwherever he might be found in the State.\u201d There is no reference to service outside the State.\nThe order of the court below is affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost."}
