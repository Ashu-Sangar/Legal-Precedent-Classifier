{"id": "438412", "contents": "Mr. Justice Paxson\ndelivered the opinion of the court, November 15th 1875.\nWe think the affidavit of defence filed in this case, while not as specific as it might have been, was nevertheless sufficient to prevent judgment. The copy of the note filed by the plaintiff below goes to sustain the denial of his title contained in the affidavit referred to. It is endorsed \u201c William Dilworth, Jr.; pay R. McCurdy, Cash.\u201d This is a special endorsement, and upon its face conveys no title to the plaintiff below. The further allegation that the note in controversy was procured by false and fraudulent representations, and that the consideration thereof has failed, coupled with the denial of said plaintiff\u2019s title, was sufficient to pnt the latter upon proof that he is a bon\u00e1 fide holder.\nJudgment reversed and a procedendo awarded."}
