{"id": "1272526", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Bell,\nFour defendants were indicted for obstructing public justice and for perjury. The jury convicted all of them of obstructing justice and two of them of perjury. Their appeals were reviewed and, with one exception, correctly decided by the Superior Court in an able comprehensive opinion by Judge Hirt. We allowed an allocatur in the case of Commonwealth v. Russo et al.\nDefendants were police officers of the City of Pittsburgh and members of a special detail known as the Vice Squad. Although the defendants were tried separately, their appeals were argued together before the Superior Court and before us, and we may appropriately dispose of them in this one opinion.\nThe crucial question is whether Tanser was convicted of perjury upon evidence which violated his constitutional right of confrontation of witnesses. Tanser testified at the magistrate\u2019s hearing that George Garis solicited him to commit sodomy, giving the time and place of solicitation. Tanser testified at the Grand Jury hearing and denied any such solicitation by Garis, consequently the Grand Jury did not have sufficient evidence to indict Garis. . As a result, of Tanser\u2019s testimony before tbe Grand Jury, he was indicted for \u201cwilfully, falsely, knowingly and corruptly swearing at the January (1951) Sessions of the (indicting) Grand Jury that George Garis had not solicited the said Alan Tanser to commit oral sodomy with him.\u201d\nThe stenographer who took \u201csome\u201d notes of testimony \u2014 those portions which she deemed to be important \u2014 at the magistrate\u2019s hearing, and the stenographer who took the notes of testimony at the (indicting) Grand Jury hearing, were produced by the Commonwealth and testified in Tanser\u2019s perjury trial. However, Garis did not testify, it being alleged that he could not be found. A transcript of the magistrate\u2019s hearing \u2014 which contained a part of the testimony which the stenographer considered to be important\u2014 which quoted Garis as saying \u201cI admit this\u201d, was introduced into evidence by the Commonwealth, over the objection of the defendant, in order to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Tanser had committed perjury in his testimony before the Grand Jury. Without this transcript, the evidence was insufficient to convict Tanser of the perjury with which he was charged. The Superior Court held that the transcript was admissible and sustained Tanser\u2019s conviction of perjury at the Grand Jury hearing.\nIn Russo\u2019s case, the stenographer who took some notes of testimony at the magistrate\u2019s hearing, and the stenographer who took the notes of testimony at the (indicting) Grand Jury hearing, were produced by the Commonwealth and testified in Russo\u2019s perjury trial. The magistrate\u2019s transcripts were introduced into evidence by the Commonwealth, over the objection of the defendant. Those transcripts showed that the persons who had been arrested for solicitation of sodomy neither admitted nor denied the charges. The Superior Court correctly held that Russo could not be convicted of perjury as the evidence was insufficient or inadequate to prove that he had committed perjury at the time alleged in the indictment, namely, at the time he testified before the Grand Jury. The convictions of perjury cannot be sustained against either Tanser or Russo for reasons which will be hereinafter set forth.\nThe Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Tanser was guilty of the crime with which he was charged in the bill of indictment, to wit, false swearing at the Grand Jury proceedings. Cf. Commonwealth, v. Homeyer, 373 Pa. 150, 156, 94 A. 2d 743. The Commonwealth could prove its charge by evidence which was direct or evidence which was circumstantial, but the evidence must be legally competent and sufficient in volume and quality to prove that Tanser was guilty of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt-. Commonwealth v. Kloiber, 378 Pa. 412, 106 A. 2d 820; Commonwealth v. Russo et al., 177 Pa. Superior Ct. 470, 111 A. 2d 359.\nThe so-called two witness rule in perjury cases prevails in Pennsylvania, i.e., in order to convict of perjury there must be two witnesses or one witness plus corroborating evidence: Williams v. Commonwealth, 91 Pa. 493; Commonwealth v. Mudd, 176 Pa. Superior Ct. 250, 107 A. 2d 599; Commonwealth v. Sumrak, 148 Pa. Superior Ct. 412, 25 A. 2d 605; Commonwealth v. Gore, 171 Pa. Superior Ct. 8, 90 A. 2d 405. This rule is comprehensively stated and pinpointed in Commonwealth v. Billingsley, 160 Pa. Superior Ct. 140, 50 A. 2d 703, which was affirmed by this Court in 357 Pa. 378, 54 A. 2d 705, on the opinion of Judge, now Justice Arnold. Judge Arnold said (pages 143-144):\n\u201cAs to the fact that Billingsley had procured and instigated him to testify falsely, House was the only witness and was uncorroborated except as to the meeting with Billingsley, which the latter admitted. Appellant therefore alleges that in both perjury and subornation of perjury no conviction can be had upon the testimony of one witness. The word \u2018perjury\u2019 is frequently used as synonymous with \u2018false testimony\u2019. But the crime of perjury has a number of elements: (a) An oath to tell the truth must be taken by the accused, and (b) administered by legal authority, (c) in a judicial proceeding (or statutory affidavit), (d) The accused must have testified in such proceeding, and (e) his testimony must be material to the judicial proceeding, (f) The testimony assigned as perjury must he false, and (g) must be given wilfully, and corruptly, and with knowledge of its falsity (or given recklessly), and for the purpose of having it believed. As to none of these elements is there a requirement as to the quantity of proof except as to the falsity of the testimony, i.e., the assignment of perjury. As to the falsity and as to it alone, is there a rule that conviction may not be had upon the testimony of one witness.\u201d\nHowever, where the defendant himself makes tv/o conflicting statements under oath, the general rule does not apply. The exception, and the difficulty of proving even obvious perjury, is well stated in Commonwealth v. Mudd, 176 Pa. Superior Ct., supra (pages 253-254) : \u201c(1) We will assume arguendo that appellant\u2019s testimony before the grand jury was materially different from [or diametrically opposed to] his testimony before the magistrate. The conflicting statements establish that perjury was committed. The general rule that the Commonwealth must offer either two witnesses to the falsity, or one witness and corroboration, is not applicable where the defendant makes two conflicting statements under oath: Commonwealth v. Sumrak, 148 Pa. Superior Ct. 412, 25 A. 2d 605. . . .\n\u201c(2) Although the making of two conflicting statements under oath establishes perjury, the Commonwealth nevertheless has the burden of adducing some competent evidence from which the jury may find that the perjury was committed on the occasion charged in the indictment: Commonwealth v. Sumrak, supra, 148 Pa. Superior Ct. 412, 25 A. 2d 605. \u2018When such statements are made under oath, there is no doubt that the person making them has committed perjury, hut the difficulty is as to which of the two statements is the false one\u2019: Commonwealth v. Bradley, 109 Pa. Superior Ct. 294, 167 A. 471.\u201d\nIn Commonwealth v. Bradley, 109 Pa. Superior Ct., supra, the Court said (pages 296-298) : \u201c. . . It has been repeatedly ruled that two or more contradictory statements of the defendant standing alone without anything else will not sustain a charge of perjury. The authorities to this effect are collected in L.R.A. 1917 C 58 and L.R.A. 1918, 927 and 21 B.C.L. 271. This is true whether such statements were made under oath or not, or whether they were spoken or contained in writing. When such statements are made under oath, there is no doubt that the person making them has committed perjury, but the difficulty is as to which of the two statements is the false one. \u2018A different question would be presented were it permissible to charge perjury in the alternative without being required to elect as between the two contradictory statements. The question, however, upon this hypothesis does not seem to have arisen in any reported case probably because the premise is untenable.\u2019\n. . In Greenleaf on Evidence, Yol. 1, Section 259, it is said: \u2018If the evidence adduced in proof of the crime of perjury consists of two opposing statements of the prisoner, and nothing more, he cannot he convicted.\u2019 . .\nThe Superior Court in the present case recognized the aforesaid principles and then said (page 481): \u201cAppellant Tanser insists that in the trial of the charges against him the Commonwealth was bound to call Garis as its witness who was accused in the Morals Court of soliciting sodomy. He contends that he had the right of confrontation by Garis who made the statement in response to the officer\u2019s testimony and that a denial of that right made the magistrate\u2019s transcript inadmissible because of hearsay.\u201d\nThe Superior Court then held (1) that the Commonwealth was not obliged to produce Garis at the trial of Tanser and (2) that the magistrate\u2019s transcript was not hearsay and therefore was admissible in evidence and (3) that the transcript, together with all the other evidence in the case, was sufficient competent evidence \u201cof the truth of Tanser\u2019s accusations made against Garis under oath at the time\u201d, viz., at the magistrate\u2019s hearing, and (4) that consequently, from the entire record, the jury could find that Tanser\u2019s testimony before the Grand Jury was perjury as charged in the indictment.\nWe agree with the Superior Court that the Commonwealth was not bound to produce Garis at Tanser\u2019s perjury trial, if it could produce other competent evidence which was sufficient to prove that Tanser committed the crime charged in the indictment. The Commonwealth sought to bridge the gap left by the disappearance of Garis by (we repeat) introducing in evidence, over Tanser\u2019s objection, a transcript of Garis\u2019s testimony at the magistrate\u2019s hearing. Assuming arguendo that this transcript would ordinarily be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule, it is clear that it was inadmissible in the instant case, over Tanser\u2019s objection, because it violated Tanser\u2019s Constitutional right of \u201cmeeting the witnesses face to face\u201d at the trial of his perjury case. Article I, \u00a79 of the Constitution of Pennsylvania provides that \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions the accused hath a right ... to meet the witnesses face to face\u201d: Commonwealth v. Johnson, 348 Pa. 349, 35 A. 2d 312. This was the crucial basic, fundamental point which we believe was inadequately considered by the Superior Court. Garis was the accused, Tanser was not \u201cthe accused\u201d at the magistrate\u2019s hearing. If the transcript of Garis\u2019s testimony is excluded because it was improperly admitted in evidence, the evidence on behalf of the Commonwealth (proved that Tanser committed perjury but) was not legally sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Tanser committed perjury at the time and place charged in the indictment, to wit, at the Grand Jury proceedings (instead of at the magistrate\u2019s hearing).\nMany people possess the trait of being loose-tongued or willing to say something behind a person\u2019s back that they dare not or cannot truthfully say to his face or under oath in a Courtroom. It was probably for this reason, as well as to give the accused the right to cross-examine his accusers and thereby enable the jury to better determine the credibility of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses and the strength and truth of its case, that this important added protection was given to every person accused of crime. We have no right to disregard or (unintentionally) erode or distort any provision of the Constitution, especially where, as here, its plain and simple language make its meaning unmistakably clear; indeed, because of the times in which we live we have a higher duty than ever before to zealously protect and safeguard the Constitution.\nWe reluctantly come to the conclusion that the Commonwealth must fail in this case for want of witnesses or of other competent and adequate evidence, and that the conviction of Tanser and Eusso for perjury cannot be sustained.\nThe judgment of sentence of Alan Tanser on Bill No. 645 for perjury is reversed. The judgments of sentence of Alan Tanser on all other bills of indictment, the judgments of sentence of Guy Eusso and the judgments of sentence of Martin J. Scanlon and the Orders of the Superior Court thereon are affirmed.\n177 Pa. Superior Court 470, 111 A. 2d 359.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nWe are not unmindful of \u00a73 of the Act of May 23, 1887, P. L. 158, 19 PS \u00a7582, or of Commonwealth v. Cleary, 148 Pa. 26, 23 A. 1110; Brown v. Commonwealth, 73 Pa. 321; Commonwealth v. Keck, 148 Pa. 639, 24 A. 161; Commonwealth v. Lenousky, 206 Pa. 277, 55 A. 977; and Commonwealth v. Ryhal, 274 Pa. 401, 118 A. 358. These authorities were not referred to by the Superior Court or by the litigants probably because they are clearly distinguishable.\nThere are many other instances under our judicial system where an accused who is obviously guilty cannot be convicted because of some legal prerequisite which cannot be satisfied, e.g., a traitor cannot be convicted of treason unless there are two witnesses to the treason; an accused cannot be convicted of a crime where the Commonwealth\u2019s sole implicating witness disappears or recants his prior testimony or statements; an accused who is guilty of a crime cannot be convicted if the Commonwealth fails to con vince all twelve jurymen that it has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt; and even self-confessed murderers have gone free, because without their confessions the Commonwealth was unable to make out the prima facie case which the law requires. The net result in such eases is a miscarriage of justice. Nevertheless, Courts cannot ignore the Constitution or principles of law which have been firmly established for the protection of the innocent, even though these safeguards sometimes allow the guilty to escape punishment."}
