{"id": "18470", "contents": "ORDER\nPER CURIAM.\nAND NOW this 30th day of October, 1997, the Commonwealth\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal is granted. The order of the Superior Court dated January 22, 1997, is vacated in part to the extent it ordered a new trial based on a finding of ineffectiveness of counsel, a matter outside the scope of this court\u2019s order dated August 16, 1996. The August 16, 1996 order remanded the case for a determination on the merits of only those issues (suppression and weight of the evidence) which had been previously dismissed on procedural rather than substantive grounds.\nThis matter is remanded to the Superior Court to address the merits of Appellee\u2019s claim that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence."}
