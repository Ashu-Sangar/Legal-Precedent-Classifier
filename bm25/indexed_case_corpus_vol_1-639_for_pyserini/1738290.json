{"id": "1738290", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThese are appeals from final decrees of the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County terminating the parental rights of appellant Gladys B. to her daughter Judith Denise B. and of appellant Marjorie L. to her three sons William L., Mark L., and Frank L. Appellee, in both appeals, is Lycoming County Children\u2019s Services [Children\u2019s Services]. The parental rights of both appellants were terminated pursuant to section 311(2) of the Adoption Act of 1970. In addition to challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support the decrees entered in their respective cases, both appellants claim that section 311(2) is vague, in violation of the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. They also assert that section 311(2), as applied to them, deprives them of their interest in maintaining their parental relationships protected by the first, ninth, and fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution. Because of the substantial similarity of these claims, we agreed to hear and decide the two cases together. We affirm in both appeals.\nI. SECTION 311(2) OF THE 1970 ADOPTION ACT IS NEITHER UNCONSTITUTIONALLY VAGUE NOR VIOLATIVE OF SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS AND MAY CONSTITUTIONALLY BE APPLIED TO TERMINATE APPELLANTS\u2019 PARENTAL RIGHTS.\nEvery presumption is in favor of the constitutionality of legislative acts, Statutory Construction Act of 1972, 1 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 1922(3) (Supp.1977), and statutes are to be construed whenever possible to uphold their constitutionality. Bentman v. Seventh Ward Democratic Executive Committee, 421 Pa. 188, 218 A.2d 261 (1966). \u201cCourts may not declare a statute unconstitutional \u2018unless it clearly, palpably, and plainly violates the Constitution.\u2019 \u201d Tosto v. Pennsylvania Nursing Home Loan Agency, 460 Pa. 1, 16, 331 A.2d 198, 205 (1975), quoting Daly v. Hemphill, 411 Pa. 263, 271, 191 A.2d 835, 840 (1963). Appellants\u2019 constitutional challenges do not meet this stringent burden.\nAppellants both assert that section 311(2) of the Adoption Act is unconstitutional unless given a narrowing interpretation precluding its application to terminate their respective parental rights. They assert that parents have a fundamental interest in continued association with their children protected by the United States Constitution. They contend that section 311(2) violates this interest unless inter-preted to require two showings before parental rights may be terminated: (1) that the parent has demonstrated a \u201chigh and substantial degree of misconduct;\u201d and (2) that the child, while in the parent\u2019s custody, has suffered substantial physical or mental harm because of the absence of a basic need such as food, clothing, shelter, or medical care. Appellants contend that, absent such a narrow interpretation, the phrase \u201chas caused the child to be without essential parental care, control, or subsistence necessary for his physical or mental well-being\u201d in section 311(2) is unconstitutionally vague because it is susceptible to arbitrary enforcement and fails to give adequate notice to parents of the conduct required of them. We do not agree. Section 311(2) is not unconstitutionally vague and may constitutionally be applied to terminate parental rights where, as here, the record establishes \u201cthe repeated and continued incapacity\u201d of a parent to provide the child with the \u201cessential parental care, control, or subsistence necessary for his physical or mental well-being.\u201d\nA. Section 311(2) is not unconstitutionally vague because the language of the section and the decisions of this Court interpreting section 311(2) provide sufficiently precise guidelines to ensure reasonable notice and proper application.\nVague statutes may offend the Constitution in three ways: (1) they may trap the innocent by failing to give a person of ordinary intelligence reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited so that he may act accordingly; (2) they may result in arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement in the absence of explicit guidelines for their application, and (3) where they implicate first amendment freedoms, they may inhibit constitutionally protected activity. Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2298-99, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972). Appellants argue that the language \u201chas caused the child to be without essential parental care, control, or subsistence necessary for his physical or mental well-being\u201d in section 311(2) presents all three dangers. See Alsager v. District Court of Polk City, Iowa, 406 F.Supp. 10 (S.D.Iowa 1975), aff\u2019d in part, 545 F.2d 1137 (8th Cir. 1976).\nConsidering first the question of notice, we believe appellants misperceive the nature of section 311(2). Unlike the typical statute attacked on vagueness grounds, section 311(2) does not prohibit or regulate any particular conduct. Section 311(2) is concerned only with the welfare of children whose essential needs have not been met, and whose parent cannot or will not meet those needs in the future. In the instant cases, the basis for termination is several years of demonstrated parental incapacity, which does not involve parental misconduct. When a statute attaches consequences to parental incapacity, a requirement that the statute \u201cgive a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden by the statute,\u201d United States v. Harriss, 347 U.S. 612, 617, 74 S.Ct. 808, 812, 98 L.Ed. 989 (1954), serves no purpose, because the statute applies only to a parent incapable of conforming conduct to avoid the effect of the statute.\nOf course, the other bases for termination relate to parental neglect, abuse, or refusal to meet the child\u2019s essential needs and thus involve parental misconduct. Section 311(2), however, requires that, before parental rights may be terminated, the court must find that the \u201cconditions and causes of the incapacity, abuse, neglect, or refusal cannot or will not be remedied by the parent.\u201d 1 P.S. \u00a7 311(2) (Supp.1977). This requirement excludes the possibility that parental rights will be terminated because of insufficient notice, since the parent\u2019s inability or unwillingness to meet the child\u2019s essential needs must be affirmatively demonstrated. The requirement that parental conduct resulting in termination of parental rights be irremediable negates appellants\u2019 notice argument.\nSecond, section 311(2) does not create the potential for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement. The language of section 311(2) is broad and speaks in general terms, as do most statutes concerned with neglect. However, our strong policy protecting the family from unwarranted state intrusion protects against arbitrary or discriminatory applications of section 311(2).\nWhen the child is in the home, this on-going relationship will not be disturbed except upon a showing by clear and convincing evidence that removal is \u201cclearly necessary.\u201d Adoption of R.I., 468 Pa. 287, 294, 361 A.2d 294, 297 (1976); Interest of Larue, 244 Pa.Super. 218, 366 A.2d 1271, 1275 (1976). It is not enough to justify termination of parental rights under section 311(2) to demonstrate that the home is \u201csubmarginal\u201d and likely to result in a \u201ccultural deprivation.\u201d In re Geiger, 459 Pa. 636, 640, 331 A.2d 172, 174 (1975). These decisions render agency officials powerless to remove a child from parental care and control absent a clear showing that the child either has been subjected to abuse or suffered serious harm, or that the threat of such harm is real and substantial and cannot be alleviated by means less drastic than removal.\nOften, as in these appeals, the question of whether to terminate parental rights arises long after the unity of the family has been disrupted by separation of the child from the parent. Marjorie L\u2019s three sons have been in foster care since 1971; Gladys B\u2019s daughter Judith has been in foster care since 1974. Extended relegation of a child to the care of others as a result of parental incapacity or neglect is relevant in determining whether the child has been without essential parental care or control. See Rothstein v. Lutheran Social Services of Wisconsin and Upper Michigan, 405 U.S. 1051, 92 S.Ct. 1488, 31 L.Ed.2d 786 (1972); cf. In re Smith\u2019s Adoption, 412 Pa. 501, 194 A.2d 919 (1963) (that natural mother allowed foster parents to meet child\u2019s physical and mental needs for over a year was relevant to termination of parental rights). A stable family relationship is \u201cnecessary for [a child\u2019s] physical or mental well-being.\u201d \u201cContinuity of parental affection and care provides the cornerstone for the child\u2019s sense of self worth and security; parental discipline and example develop the wellsprings of values and ideals.\u201d Note, In the Child\u2019s Best Interests: Rights of the Natural Parents in Child Placement Proceedings, 51 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 446, 450 (1976). The essential need of a child for close and continuous association with a parent or parent-figure is well recognized in psychological literature. See sources cited in id. at 449-51.\nAccordingly, when a child has been placed in foster care, a parent has an affirmative duty to work towards the return of the child. See Involuntary Termination of Parental Rights of S.C.B. and K.T., 474 Pa. 615, 379 A.2d 535 (1977); Appeal of Diane B., 456 Pa. 429, 321 A.2d 618 (1974). However, even when there has been a long separation occasioned by parental neglect or incapacity, termination of parental rights will not be ordered if there is a reasonable possibility that the causes and conditions which have led to the separation can be remedied and the family restored. Jones Appeal, 449 Pa. 543, 297 A.2d 117 (1972), demonstrates our deference to this requirement. There, although the mother was an accomplice to sexual abuse of her daughter, we refused to terminate her parental rights because the evidence did not establish that the causes or conditions leading to the abuse could not be remedied. Id. 449 Pa. at 548, 297 A.2d at 120.\nThe language of section 311(2) does not admit of an interpretation permitting termination of parental rights based upon personal preferences or speculative concepts of proper child rearing. The needs of the child unmet by the parent must be \u201cessential\u201d and \u201cnecessary\u201d to his \u201cphysical or mental well-being.\u201d In addition, the evidence must establish that the causes and conditions of the deprivation \u201ccannot or will not be remedied.\u201d\nWe conclude that the demanding standards of section 311(2), together with the Legislature\u2019s and this Court\u2019s strong policy of restraint from interfering with the family, sufficiently protect against the arbitrary and discriminatory application of section 311(2).\nSimilarly, even assuming that decisions affecting private family concerns implicate first amendment values, see Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479, 485, 85 S.Ct. 1678, 1682, 14 L.Ed.2d 510 (1965), we must reject appellants\u2019 argument that the language of section 311(2) may have a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on protected parental conduct. The decisions of this Court interpreting section 311(2) protect parental conduct which does not deprive the child of its essential needs. See In re Geiger, supra. However, parental misconduct which deprives the child of essential needs is not protected by the Constitution. Mr. Chief Justice Burger, writing for the Court, stated in Wisconsin v. Yoder: \u201cTo be sure, the power of the parent even when linked to a free exercise claim, may be subject to limitation . . . if it appears that parental decisions will jeopardize the health or safety of the child, or have a potential for significant social burdens.\u201d 406 U.S. 205, 233-34, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1542, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972). Section 311(2) and our decisions are sufficiently clear to avoid any significant possibility a parent would be inhibited from engaging in protected conduct not constituting deprivation of essential needs of the child.\nB. Section 311(2) does not violate substantive due process rights because a state may constitutionally intervene to terminate parental rights when a natural parent\u2019s continued incapacity causes the child to be without essential parental care.\nAppellants argue that the application of section 311(2) to terminate their respective parental rights, in the absence of a showing of \u201chigh and substantial misconduct\u201d and that their children, while in their custody, had ever suffered substantial physical or mental harm, violates their constitutionally protected interest in mutual association with their children. We do not agree.\nThere is no doubt that the Constitution protects the family against certain intrusions by the state. Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 43 S.Ct. 625, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923), generally considered the seminal case recognizing constitutional protection of family concerns, invalidated a statute which prohibited teaching young children any language other than English because the statute unreasonably infringed upon the liberty interest, protected by the fourteenth amendment, of parents, teachers, and children. Noting that the contours of the liberty interest guaranteed by the fourteenth amendment had never been exactly defined, the Court stated: \u201cWithout doubt, it denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to . . . marry, establish a home, and bring up children . . . .\u201d Id. at 399, 43 S.Ct. at 626. Accord, Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) (striking down a statute requiring that all children attend public schools). In Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944), the Court recognized that:\n\u201cIt is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can neither supply nor hinder, [citing Pierce ] And it is in recognition of this that these decisions [Pierce and Meyer] have respected the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.\u201d\nId. at 166, 64 S.Ct. at 442.\nThe continued vitality of the principle that there is a \u201cprivate realm of family life which the state cannot enter\u201d cannot be questioned. Just last term the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201cwhen the government intrudes on choices concerning family living arrangements, this Court must examine carefully the importance of the governmental interests advanced and the extent to which they are served by the challenged regulation.\u201d Moore v. City of East Cleveland, Ohio, 431 U.S. 494, 499, 97 S.Ct. 1932, 1936, 52 L.Ed.2d 531 (1977) (plurality opinion). See also Smith v. Organization of Foster Families for Equality and Reform, 431 U.S. 816, 829, 97 S.Ct. 2094, 2109, 53 L.Ed.2d 14 (1977); Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U.S. 632, 639-40, 94 S.Ct. 791, 796, 39 L.Ed.2d 52 (1974) (\u201cThis Court has long recognized that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 231-33, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1541-42, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972); Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 1212, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972); Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 639, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 1280, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968).\nIn related cases, the United States Supreme Court has recognized that the Constitution affords protection to \u201ca right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy.\u201d Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 152, 93 S.Ct. 705, 726, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). See also Carey v. Population Services International, 431 U.S. 678, 684, 97 S.Ct. 2010, 2016, 52 L.Ed.2d 675 (1977) (plurality opinion); Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 598, 97 S.Ct. 869, 876 (1977); Griswold v. Connecticut, supra at 485, 85 S.Ct. at 1682. Personal decisions relating to child rearing are within this zone and protected from unwarranted interference by the state. Carey v. Population Services International, supra, 431 U.S. at 684, 97 S.Ct. at 2016 (plurality opinion), citing Pierce and Meyer.\nThese cases do not, however, support the proposition that the state can never interfere in the parent-child relationship. Indeed, in Stanley v. Illinois, supra, the United States Supreme Court recognized that the state had not only a right, but a duty to protect minor children. 405 U.S. at 649, 92 S.Ct. at 1212. See also Prince v. Massachusetts, supra (upholding anti-child labor statute against challenge that it unreasonably infringed upon parent\u2019s and child\u2019s free exercise of religion and parent\u2019s right to educate child in her beliefs). Constitutional restraint on state interference in family matters does not compel the courts to protect parental rights at the expense of ignoring the rights and needs of children. In Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 96 S.Ct. 2831, 49 L.Ed.2d 788 (1976), the United States Supreme Court rejected the argument that the state\u2019s interest in protecting parental authority justified giving parents a veto power over a minor\u2019s decision to have an abortion \u201cwhere the minor and the nonconsenting parent are so fundamentally in conflict and the very existence of the pregnancy has already fractured the family structure.\u201d Id. at 75, 96 S.Ct. at 2844. See also Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 241 49, 92 S.Ct. at 1546-50 (concurring and dissenting opinion of Douglas, J.); In re Roger S., 19 Cal.3d 921, 141 Cal.Rptr. 298, 569 P.2d 1286 (1977) (unconstitutional to permit parent of fourteen year old child to commit the child to a mental institution over the child\u2019s objection). In determining whether parental rights should be terminated, the court must recognize the essential needs of the child as well as the rights of the parent.\nThe source of the state\u2019s authority to intervene in family matters to protect minor children has been said to be the doctrine of parens patriae, the concept that the sovereign is the father of his country. See, e. g., Adoption of R.I., 468 Pa. at 294, 361 A.2d at 297. Although the doctrine of parens patriae has been subject to critical comment in recent years, there is general agreement that the state has the right and the duty to act to protect its weaker members, such as infants, who are unable to protect themselves, and to compel parents and children alike to act in ways beneficial to society. See Kleinfeld, The Balance of Power Among Infants, Their Parents and the State, 4 Fam. L.Q. 320 (1970), 4 Fam.L.Q. 410 (1970), 5 Fam.L.Q. 64 (1971). The state\u2019s responsibility to protect its weaker members authorizes interference with parental autonomy and decisionmaking in appropriate circumstances. The moral and practical importance of this authority was set forth by Chief Justice Maxey in Commonwealth ex rel. Children\u2019s Aid Society v. Gard:\n\u201cSocieties which like the relator are entrusted by the sovereign with power over the lives of infants should ever bear in mind that consideration for the sensibilities of children and solicitude for their well-being is the hallmark of an humane individual and of a civilized state.\u201d\n362 Pa. 85, 99, 66 A.2d 300, 307 (1949).\nParental rights must be accorded significant protection. Meyer v. Nebraska, supra; Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra; Prince v. Massachusetts, supra; and Wiscon sin v. Yoder, supra. The state may, however, constitutionally require the rights of parents to yield to the child\u2019s essential health and safety needs. See Wisconsin v. Yoder, supra; accord, In the Matter of Petition for Adoption of J.S.R., 374 A.2d 860 (D.C.1977) (\u201c[T]he right of a parent to raise one\u2019s child is an essential, but not absolute, one, which can be terminated . . . .\u201d). When, as here, a parent is incapable of meeting the child\u2019s essential needs, see section II, infra, the state may constitutionally intervene to protect the \u201cphysical or mental well-being\u201d of the child. In these circumstances, the interest of the parent in keeping the child conflicts with the interest of the child in its essential physical and emotional needs and the Legislature has constitutionally mandated that the interests of the weaker party, the child, should prevail. This legislative determination must be accorded great deference for \u201cwhen an issue involves policy choices as sensitive as those implicated by [the involuntary termination of parental rights], the appropriate forum for their resolution in a democracy is the legislature.\u201d Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 2385-86, 53 L.Ed.2d 484 (1977). As Mr. Justice Holmes stated in Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway Company v. May, 194 U.S. 267, 270, 24 S.Ct. 638, 639, 48 L.Ed. 971 (1904): \u201c[Legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.\u201d\nTherefore, appellants\u2019 assertion that \u201chigh and substantial misconduct\u201d on the part of the parent must be shown before parental rights may be constitutionally terminated cannot be accepted. Their contention ignores the state\u2019s constitutional interest in the welfare of the child.\n11. THE DECREES OF THE ORPHANS\u2019 COURT DIVISION TERMINATING THE PARENTAL RIGHTS OF APPELLANTS ARE SUPPORTED BY COMPETENT .EVIDENCE.\nA. Scope of Review\nHaving determined that section 311(2) of the 1970 Adoption Act is constitutional, it remains to be determined whether the orphans\u2019 court properly applied the section to the facts of the instant cases. Our scope of review is limited to determining whether the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s terminations of appellants\u2019 parental rights are supported by competent evidence. E. g., In re: Involuntary Termination of Parental Rights of S.C.B. and K.T., 474 Pa. 615, 624, 379 A.2d 535, 540 (1977); Adoption of M.T.T., 467 Pa. 88, 354 A.2d 564 (1976); Adoption of Farabelli, 460 Pa. 423, 333 A.2d 846 (1975) (plurality opinion); Sheaffer Appeal, 452 Pa. 165, 305 A.2d 36 (1973). Findings of the orphans\u2019 court supported by evidence of record are entitled to the same weight given a jury verdict and must be sustained unless the court abused its discretion or committed an error of law. E. g., Garges Estate, 474 Pa. 237, 378 A.2d 307 (1977); In re Wertman Estate, 462 Pa. 195, 340 A.2d 429 (1975); Button Estate, 459 Pa. 234, 328 A.2d 480 (1974); Cohen Will, 445 Pa. 549, 284 A.2d 754 (1971); Holtz Will, 422 Pa. 540, 222 A.2d 885 (1966); Hunter Will, 416 Pa. 127, 205 A.2d 97 (1964).\nB. The orphans\u2019 court division\u2019s determination that appellant Marjorie L.\u2019s continued incapacity to care for her children, combined with her separation from her children since 1971, had caused her three sons to be without \u201cessential parental care,\u201d and that this incapacity could not be remedied by appellant, is supported by competent evidence [Appeal at No. 46].\nThe three children involved in this appeal are Frank, age 13, William, age 11, and Mark, age 7. Pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement, all have been in the custody of Children\u2019s Services since June 8, 1971, when they were, respectively, ages 7, 5, and 1. Appellant has never married and none of the fathers of the three children has opposed termination of his parental rights. Appellant has two other children. Carol, the oldest, age 17, has lived with appellant\u2019s parents for many years and there are no plans for her to return to her mother. Appellant\u2019s youngest child, Tracie, age 6, lives with appellant.\nAppellant was pregnant with Tracie at the time she placed her three sons with Children\u2019s Services. Children\u2019s Services had become involved with appellant and her children because of the severely substandard condition of the home which, according to appellant\u2019s caseworker, was unfit for habitation by children. After Tracie\u2019s birth Children\u2019s Services helped appellant locate an apartment. The apartment appellant selected could accommodate only appellant and Tracie. Frank, William and Mark continued to remain in foster care, and appellant visited them once a month at the Children\u2019s Services\u2019 office. In November, 1974, while still in the two-person apartment, appellant requested that her three sons be returned. The agency, concluding appellant was unable to provide the children with appropriate care and supervision, declined. Children\u2019s Services advised appellant of the availability of legal services and in December, 1975, with the assistance of counsel, appellant petitioned for visitation with the children in her home. The court of common pleas ordered that her visitation be increased to twice a month, and that visitation be at her home.\nShortly after the three boys entered foster care in 1971, nutrition aids began regularly visiting appellant\u2019s home to help her maintain her household and raise Tracie. Appellant has continuously relied heavily on these aids for even the more simple tasks of everyday life. The nutrition aid supervisor testified that in the three week period before the hearing appellant had visited her approximately seventeen times for assistance with various minor problems, even though the supervisor\u2019s office was some distance from appellant\u2019s home. Despite the continuous assistance, however, appellant has made little or no progress in learning how to cope with problems on her own, and the aids must necessarily continue to perform basic tasks for appellant.\nThe record establishes that appellant is minimally capable of caring for her youngest daughter Tracie, even with the extensive assistance she receives from the nutrition aids. The record also establishes, however, that appellant\u2019s capabilities are taxed beyond their limits when she attempts to supervise and control her three sons, in addition to Tracie. The caseworkers and aids present during the custodial visits ordered in 1975, which continued regularly up to the time of the hearing in May, 1976, testified that general havoc prevailed during the visits. They described the visits as \u201cfree-for-alls\u201d in which appellant chased one child after another attempting to keep them under control. The visits failed to re-establish closer ties between appellant and the boys. Frank and William were observed to \u201ctolerate their mother.\u201d Mark, who has been with the same foster family since he was one year old, was unable to relate emotionally to appellant or his brothers and would simply watch television.\nAll three children testified in chambers and, although they expressed some affection for appellant, agreed that they did not want to live with appellant. Frank, then 13, openly admitted that he refused to obey appellant and that she was incapable of doing anything about it. He believed that appellant would not be able to care for him and his brothers.\nIn January, 1976, appellant, at the request of Children\u2019s Services, agreed to be interviewed and tested by a psychologist. The psychologist administered a structured interview called the Yinelin Social Maturity Scale and the standardized Slosson Intelligence Test. The first test indicated that appellant\u2019s social skills and ability to function independently were at about the twelve year old level. The intelligence test, which measures numerical and verbal reasoning skills, indicated that appellant had an IQ of 43 and a mental age of six years, ten months. Although appellant testified at the hearing that she had completed the seventh grade in school, she told the psychologist that she did not know how to read. The psychologist testified that appellant had limited communication skills and showed considerable difficulty in comprehending simple ideas concerning housework, cooking, and child care. In her psychological evaluation, the psychologist concluded that appellant lacked the social maturity and intellectual capability to cope with the continuing responsibilities of raising children.\nThe orphans\u2019 court terminated appellant\u2019s parental rights to her three sons pursuant to section 311(2) of the Adoption Act. As this Court observed in In re Geiger, 459 Pa. 636, 639, 331 A.2d 172, 174 (1975), this section requires that three facts be shown before parental rights may be terminated: (1) repeated and continued incapacity, abuse, neglect, or refusal; (2) such incapacity, abuse, neglect, or refusal has caused the child to be without essential parental care, control or subsistence necessary for his physical or mental well-being; and (3) the causes of the incapacity, abuse, neglect, or refusal cannot or will not be remedied. A decision to terminate parental rights, never to be made lightly or without a sense of compassion for the parent, can seldom be more difficult than when termination is based upon parental incapacity. The Legislature, however, in enacting the 1970 Adoption Act, concluded that a parent who is incapable of performing parental duties is just as parentally unfit as one who refuses to perform the duties. The orphans\u2019 court properly adhered to this statutory determination and concluded that the elements of the statute \u2014 continued incapacity to meet the children\u2019s essential needs \u2014 had been demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence. The orphans\u2019 court stated:\n\u201cIt is absolutely clear to the court that, by reason of her very limited social and intellectual development combined with her five-year separation from the children, the mother is incapable of providing minimal care, control and supervision for the three children. Her incapacity cannot and will not be remedied.\u201d\nHaving first determined that grounds for termination existed, the orphans\u2019 court held that the best interests of Frank, William and Mark dictated that appellant\u2019s parental rights be terminated in order that the opportunity might be afforded the three boys to enjoy a stable family relationship through adoption. We find the decree of the orphans\u2019 court supported by competent evidence.\nAppellant argues that the decree cannot be sustained because there was no compelling evidence that Frank, William, and Mark, while in her care, were ever neglected, abused, or abandoned by appellant or deprived of a basic health need such as food, medical care, clothing, or shelter. Appellant also asserts that a \u201chigh and substantial degree of misconduct\u201d by the parent must be demonstrated before the parent\u2019s.rights to a child may be terminated. She contends that section 311(2) requires a showing that substantial physical or mental harm resulted from the absence of a basic necessity such as food, clothing, shelter, or medical care, and that such harm occurred while the child was living with its parent. Finally, appellant argues that a child cannot be deprived of \u201cessential parental care, control, or subsistence\u201d while in foster care.\nNothing in the language of the act requires a showing of a \u201chigh and substantial degree of misconduct\u201d before parental rights can be terminated. In Adoption of R.I., 468 Pa. 287, 361 A.2d 294 (1976), this Court rejected the contention that \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d was a necessary predicate to termination of parental rights. Id. 468 Pa. at 297-98 n.10, 361 A.2d at 299 n.10. The notion that a showing of parental misconduct is necessary before parental rights may be terminated rests upon the erroneous assumption that the purpose of section 311(2) is to punish an ineffective or negligent parent. Section 311(2) reflects a deep concern for the essential needs of the child, not a legislative vengeance against parental misconduct. The official. comment to the Adoption Act of 1970 states that the provision \u201ccenters judicial inquiry upon the welfare of the child rather than the fault of the parent.\u201d Joint State Government Commission, Official Comment, Adoption Act (1970). Thus, section 311(2) authorizes termination upon a showing of parental incapacity, when the incapacity \u201ccannot or will not be remedied by the parent\u201d and has \u201ccaused the child to be without essential parental care, control, or subsistence necessary for his physical or mental well-being.\u201d The Legislature clearly mandated that, in such circumstances, the \u201cphysical or mental well-being\u201d of the child must be protected.\nNeither the language of section 311(2) nor our case law supports appellant\u2019s contention that section 311(2) requires a showing that the child suffered substantial physical or mental harm while in the parent\u2019s custody, see Appeal of Diane B., 456 Pa. 429, 321 A.2d 618 (1974), or that a child cannot be deprived of \u201cessential parental care, control, or subsistence\u201d while in foster care, see Adoption of R.I., 468 Pa. 287, 361 A.2d 294 (1976). Appellant argues that her narrow construction is necessary to protect the family from unwarranted and potentially harmful intrusions by the state. However, the need to guard against unwarranted state intrusion in family affairs does not require an interpretation of section 311(2) precluding its application in circumstances where, as here, the family has no prospect of being reunited and the physical and mental needs of the three children, who have already been out of the home since 1971, cannot be met by the parent.\nIt is the policy of this Commonwealth to preserve and protect the family whenever possible. The Juvenile Act like the Adoption Act, concerns state intervention in the parent-child relationship when essential to protect the welfare of the child. The Juvenile Act provides:\n\u201cThis Act shall be interpreted and construed as to effectuate the following purposes: Act of December 6, 1972, P.L. 1464, \u00a7 1(b)(1), (3), 11 P.S. \u00a7 50-101(b)(l), (3) (Supp.1977). Thus, our courts have held that, under the Juvenile Act, the state may act to remove a child from its home only upon a showing of \u201cclear necessity.\u201d Adoption of R.I., 468 Pa. at 294, 361 A.2d at 297 (dictum); Interest of Larue, 244 Pa.Super. 218, 225, 366 A.2d 1271, 1275 (1976); Stapleton v. Dauphin County Child Care Services, 228 Pa.Super. 371, 391, 324 A.2d 562, 572 (1974); Rinker Appeal, 180 Pa.Super. 143, 117 A.2d 780 (1955).\n(1) To preserve the unity of the family whenever possible and to provide for the care, protection, and wholesome mental and physical development of children coming within the provisions of this act.\n(3) To achieve the foregoing purposes in a family environment whenever possible, separating the child from parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interest of public safety.\u201d\nThis policy of restraint, however, is not intended solely to protect the rights of parents. Continuity of relationships is also important to a child, for whom severance of close parental ties is usually extremely painful. Goldstein, Freud & Solnit, Beyond the Best Interests of the Child 20, 31-34 (1973), cited in Wald, \u201cSearch for Realistic Standards,\u201d supra at 994. Thus the policy of restraint is incorporated in the demanding standards of our removal and termination statutes to protect the family from harmful and unwarranted state intrusion.\nThe \u201ccontinuity of relationships\u201d consideration, however, is equally applicable where, as here, the child has lived with one foster family for a considerable period of time. Removal of the children from their foster homes, or inflicting upon them the fear that they might be removed at any time, could create psychological and emotional distress similar to that caused by their removal from their natural parent. See Adoption of R.I., supra, 468 Pa. at 299 n.13, 361 A.2d at 300 n.13; Commonwealth ex rel. Children's Aid Society v. Gard, 362 Pa. 85, 97, 66 A.2d 300, 306 (1949); Foster, Adoption and Child Custody: Best Interests of the Child?, 22 Buff.L.Rev. 1, 11-14 n.8 (1972). The language of section 311(2) should not, therefore, be read to compel courts to ignore a child\u2019s need for a stable home and strong, continuous parental ties, which the policy of restraint in state intervention is intended to protect, where, as here, disruption of the family has already occurred and there is no reasonable prospect for reuniting it without serious emotional harm to the child. In such circumstances, the issue is not whether the state should intrude to disrupt an on-going family relationship, but whether the state should seek to preserve in law a relationship which no longer exists in fact, with the result that the child is consigned indefinitely to the limbo of foster care or the impersonal care of institutions.\nAppellant\u2019s contention that a child can never be without essential parental care while in a foster home is neither factually correct nor required by the law. Appellant\u2019s interpretation of section 311(2) would, contrary to the legislative mandate, protect the rights of a parent long separated from her child at the expense of the essential physical and mental needs of the child. To the contrary, when continued incapacity prevents a parent from caring for the child and, as a result, the parent-child relationship is substantially \u201cweakened by long separation\u201d and cannot be re-established, parental rights may be terminated so that the child may have an opportunity to escape the limbo of foster or institutional care and establish a new parent-child relationship through adoption.\nHere, appellant\u2019s three sons have been in foster care since 1971. Perhaps in recognition of her own inability to care for them, appellant made no effort to secure the return of her three sons for more than three years. Despite her regular visits, appellant\u2019s relationship with her sons, especially the youngest, has greatly deteriorated. All three regard their foster parents with affection and have no desire to return to appellant\u2019s custody. In determining whether appellant\u2019s continued incapacity had caused them to be \u201cwithout essential parental care, control, or subsistence necessary for [their] physical or mental well-being,\u201d the orphans\u2019 court properly considered the fact that appellant\u2019s inability to care for the three boys since 1971 effectively precluded the possibility that the family would ever be reunited. The orphans\u2019 court concluded that \u201cthe mother will never be capable, in our judgment, of resuming custody. The choice is between the limbo of continuing fosterhood and the potentiality of a normal parent-child relationship.\u201d\nThe orphans\u2019 court\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s continued inability to care for her three sons, combined with her separation from her children since 1971, had caused her three sons to be without \u201cessential parental care, control or subsistence necessary for [their] physical or mental well-being,\u201d and that this incapacity could not or would not be remedied by appellant is supported by competent evidence. See Appeal of Diane B., 456 Pa. 429, 321 A.2d 618 (1974).\nC. The orphans\u2019 court division\u2019s determination that appellant Gladys B.\u2019s \u201crepeated and continued incapacity\u201d to maintain a safe and sanitary home had caused her daughter Judith to be without \u201cessential parental care, control or subsistence\u201d and that such incapacity would not or could not be remedied is supported by competent evidence [Appeal at No. 113].\nJudith Denise B., age 11, is appellant Gladys B.\u2019s youngest child. Judith\u2019s father left the home many years ago and his whereabouts are unknown. Judith has been in foster care since November, 1974, pursuant to an order granting custody of Judith to appellee, Lycoming County Children\u2019s Services [Children\u2019s Services].\nIn 1974, four of appellant\u2019s six minor children resided with her \u2014 Dorothy, then age 17, Boyd, then age 15, David, then age 12, and Judith, then age 9. An older daughter, Joan, and her two children also resided with appellant. Appellant was well known to public health officials and Children\u2019s Services as a result of frequent complaints received over the years concerning extremely unsanitary conditions in the different homes in which the family had lived. Children\u2019s Services had worked with the family since 1966. The caseworker involved from August 1971 until August 1975 testified that, without exception, when she visited appellant\u2019s home the floor was strewn with raw garbage on which one could not avoid stepping. She observed dogs running free throughout the house, eating off dirty diapers, and occasionally stealing food from the plates of the younger children.\nA Williamsport Public Health Officer testified to responding regularly over a ten year period to complaints filed by neighbors while appellant lived at seven different addresses. Typically, the complaints related to insect and rodent infestation and accumulations of garbage. Invariably, he found the houses grossly unsanitary, with garbage scattered both inside and about the home. Dirty clothes and particles of food were all over the floors; during the summers, he observed maggots in the food. Appellant\u2019s refrigerator was always filthy and usually contained moldy food. Roach infestation was the norm, and in appellant\u2019s last two residences, including the residence she occupied with the children in 1974, roaches were even inside the refrigerator. About the time Judith was placed in foster care, appellant was evicted from her residence in the housing project. The public health officer testified that the whole row of houses adjoining appellant\u2019s residence had to be fumigated, which took about four months. He testified that most of the twenty-five to thirty times he visited appellant\u2019s residences they were so unsanitary as to be unfit for human habitation.\nA school counselor, associated with appellant\u2019s family over an eight year period, corroborated the testimony concerning the condition of the homes. In the course of her work she visited appellant at three different residences. At each residence raw garbage and food was scattered on the floor and the odor of animal feces permeated the air. The counselor met appellant while working with Judith\u2019s brother David, who was a truancy problem. Children at school teased David because of his filthy clothes and lack of personal hygiene. The counselor testified that appellant listened to her recommendations, but did nothing to correct the problems.\nIn February, 1974, a juvenile probation officer visited the home. It was extremely squalid. The windows were out, a condition the public health officer testified was common at appellant\u2019s residences. Room temperature was below freezing and there was no heat. The probation officer could not recall if he had seen Judith, but the children he observed were inadequately clothed, including an infant wearing only a diaper. In an apparent effort to heat the house, the gas burners on the stove were turned on at full capacity. Nearby, dirty laundry was stacked up, creating an alarming fire hazard.\nThese conditions, as well as complaints from neighbors concerning a lack of supervision over the children, led Children\u2019s Services to seek custody of Judith in the Spring of 1974. Rather than remove Judith at that time, the court ordered Children\u2019s Services to visit the home regularly and assist appellant in improving conditions.\nIn March, 1974, Judith\u2019s sister Dorothy, then 17, was involved in a burglary. The juvenile court removed Dorothy from the home and placed her in foster care where she remained until she was 19. She is now enrolled in college and living outside the home. Judith\u2019s brother Boyd, then 15, was also involved in juvenile offenses. In 1973, he was before the juvenile court twice, once for burglary and larceny, and a second time for burglary. In October of 1974, he was again before the juvenile court for bicycle thefts, in which he had enlisted the aid of his 13 year old brother David and Judith, then 9 years old. Boyd was removed from the home and placed in a juvenile institution where, according to the testimony, he had an excellent record and improved educationally and socially. He returned to the home in November, 1975, but less than three months later, he was again removed after yet another theft offense. He was placed in a residential work experience program where, once again, he had an excellent record and seemed to mature considerably. He completed the program, returning home in August, 1976. His caseworker testified that, at age 17, he appeared sufficiently mature to get by on his own.\nDavid and Judith were also removed from the home following the theft offense. After completing a youth development program, David was placed in a foster home and is now in a private group home. There are no plans for his return to appellant\u2019s custody.\nAppellant\u2019s caseworker testified that, rather than improving, appellant\u2019s home deteriorated from Spring, 1974, when Children\u2019s Services first petitioned for Judith\u2019s custody, until October, 1974, when Judith was removed. Moreover, Judith\u2019s involvement in the bicycle thefts and her increasing truancy indicated that serious behavioral problems were developing. Since placed in the custody of Children\u2019s Services, she has been in a stable foster home and appears well adjusted. Children\u2019s Services considers her prospects for adoption excellent.\nAfter appellant\u2019s minor children had been removed from the home in 1974, Children\u2019s Services attempted to develop a plan with appellant which would allow Judith to return. The plan involving working with nutrition aids to improve her housekeeping and food preparation skills, seeking counseling, and allowing caseworkers to monitor conditions in the home. There was testimony that aids and caseworkers visited the home on a few occasions when conditions seemed to have improved and the home appeared reasonably sanitary. However, opportunities for observation of conditions in the home were limited because appellant was often not at home, or did not answer the door, when the nutrition aid arrived for scheduled visits, or a caseworker came to the house. Sometimes appellant or her daughter Joan refused to allow the caseworker inside and spoke to her at the door or through a window.\nThat unsanitary conditions persisted in the home was again revealed in February, 1976. David had run away from his foster home and juvenile probation caseworkers came to appellant\u2019s home where David was hiding. The conditions were so deplorable that the juvenile officers requested Children\u2019s Services to make an immediate visit. Although all of appellant\u2019s minor children were then living elsewhere, the agency was concerned about the infant children of Joan, appellant\u2019s daughter. Garbage and food were strewn on the floors throughout the house, including the upstairs. Dirty diapers were found on the floors, along with feces from several dogs and cats, causing a foul odor to permeate the house. Photographs confirm the testimony describing these grossly unsanitary conditions.\nChildren\u2019s Services petitioned for custody of Joan\u2019s children. The agency reached an agreement with Joan whereby she obtained and is maintaining a separate residence with her children.\nAppellant\u2019s willingness to cooperate with Children\u2019s Services in improving the conditions of her different residences and supervising her children has varied over the years. At times, she has listened to the suggestions of caseworkers and expressed her intention to improve her housekeeping and child care skills. Similarly, the public health officer and the school counselor who worked with David testified that appellant would hear them out and promise to follow their suggestions. Invariably, however, appellant made no effort to alleviate the offensive conditions. At other times, appellant expressed hostility towards the agency and the caseworkers for interfering in her life. Nutrition aides discontinued their visits in late 1975 because appellant was never home at the agreed times.\nAppellant, who completed only two years of schooling and is illiterate, has shown over the years almost no comprehension of even rudimentary standards necessary to maintain minimal living conditions and to supervise her children. Repeatedly, she expressed a complete inability to control the children, whom she blamed for the unsanitary conditions. For example, when advised by different caseworkers that the animals running loose throughout the house had to be controlled, she answered that she could do nothing about them because they were the children\u2019s pets.\nThe orphans\u2019 court concluded that, although appellant appeared to love Judith, the evidence clearly established appellant\u2019s \u201ccontinued and repeated incapacity\u201d which had caused Judith to be without \u201cessential parental care, control or subsistence necessary for her physical and mental well-being.\u201d The court found that this incapacity, which it attributed primarily to appellant\u2019s lack of emotional control and self-discipline, was irremediable. Having determined that grounds existed justifying termination of appellant\u2019s parental rights under section 311(2) of the Adoption Act, the court concluded that Judith\u2019s best interests would be served by terminating appellant\u2019s parental rights so that Judith might be adopted into a responsible family, able to meet her essential needs. The decree of the orphans\u2019 court is supported by adequate and competent evidence.\nAs in the appeal of Marjorie L., appellant Gladys B. argues that the decree cannot be sustained because there was no compelling evidence of a \u201chigh and substantial degree of misconduct\u201d by appellant or that Judith, while in appellant\u2019s custody, ever suffered serious harm from lack of food, clothing or shelter. We rejected the former argument in Part II B of this opinion, insofar as it relates to the requirements of the Adoption Act. Although Judith never suffered serious harm while in appellant\u2019s custody, the record fully supports the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s finding that the conditions in appellant\u2019s homes while Judith was in her custody constituted a serious threat to Judith\u2019s health and safety. We cannot agree with appellant that where, as here, a serious threat to health and safety has been shown, the court cannot terminate parental rights until serious harm actually occurs. It would indeed be an insensitive requirement that actual harm must first come to the child before the Commonwealth\u2019s interest in the child\u2019s health and welfare could be invoked.\nAppellant\u2019s reliance upon In re Geiger, 459 Pa. 636, 331 A.2d 172 (1975), in which this Court reversed a decree terminating parental rights under section 311(2), is misplaced. Geiger does not support appellant\u2019s contention that substantial physical harm to the child must first be shown before parental rights may be terminated. In Geiger, the orphans\u2019 court relied upon evidence that the home condition was \u201csubmarginal\u201d and would cause a \u201ccultural deprivation,\u201d in the future, to support termination of the parent\u2019s rights. Here, unlike in Geiger, the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s decree was based upon substantial evidence establishing that the conditions in appellant\u2019s different homes presented a serious health and safety hazard, and not merely a \u201ccultural deprivation.\u201d\nIn addition to the threat to Judith\u2019s health presented by appellant\u2019s inability to maintain a safe and sanitary home, the record supports the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s conclusion that appellant is incapable of supervising Judith. Appellant admitted she was unable to control her children when they were at home and, before Judith was taken from appellant\u2019s custody, Judith appeared to be entering the same pattern of delinquency exhibited by her older brothers and sister.\nJudith has been in foster care since 1974. Appellant\u2019s incapacity to maintain a minimally adequate home or to supervise her children, which has already led to the disruption of the family for many years, has not been remedied despite ten years of assistance from caseworkers, nutrition aides, public health officials, and school counselors. The orphans\u2019 court properly concluded that appellant\u2019s incapacity would not or could not be remedied.\nIII. SUMMARY\nWe hold that section 311(2) is not unconstitutionally vague in light of its demanding standards and the strong policy of restraint from interfering in the family developed in our case law. We also hold that, on the facts of these cases, the application of section 311(2) to terminate appellants\u2019 parental rights is constitutionally permissible. Finally, we hold that there is competent evidence in each appeal supporting the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s decrees terminating appellants\u2019 parental rights pursuant to section 311(2) of the Adoption Act.\nDecree in Appeal No. 46 terminating the parental rights of Marjorie L. is affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nDecree in Appeal No. 113 terminating the parental rights of Gladys B. is affirmed. Each party to pay own costs.\nNIX, J., filed a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. We hear these appeals pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction .Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(3), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(3) (Supp.1977).\n. Act of July 24, 1970, P.L. 620, \u00a7 311(2), 1 P.S. \u00a7 311(2) (Supp.1977). Section 311(2), for which there was no corollary provision in the previous Adoption Act, authorizes termination of parental rights when:\n\u201cThe repeated and continued incapacity, abuse, neglect, or refusal of the parent has caused the child to be without essential parental care, control, or subsistence necessary for his physical or mental well-being and the conditions and causes of the incapacity, abuse, neglect, or refusal cannot or will not be remedied by the parent.\u201d\n. The Attorney General was notified of the constitutional challenge to section 311(2) raised in these appeals, as prescribed by Pa. R.A.P. 521.\n. Legislation prescribing any particular mode of child rearing would likely be unconstitutional. See Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 535, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925); Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 399, 43 S.Ct. 625, 626, 67 L.Ed. 1042 (1923).\n. When termination is sought on the basis of parental conduct causing the child to be without essential parental care, the requirement that the conduct be shown to be irremediable could be met rarely, if ever, absent evidence that the deficiencies in parental conduct had been identified, and the parent was nonetheless unwilling or unable to modify the conduct to remedy the situation. Moreover, because of the Commonwealth\u2019s commitment to the preservation of the family, when termination is sought by an agency, a normal element of the agency\u2019s proof will be that services have been made available to the parent to help remedy the causes of removal and h\u00e1ve proved unavailing. See Adoption of R.I., 468 Pa. 287, 295 n.9, 361 A.2d 294, 298 n.9 (1976). We need not decide whether such a showing is required in light of the Commonwealth\u2019s public policy, since it is clear that both appellants have received years of assistance from Children\u2019s Services and related public agencies. See section II, infra.\n. See, e.g., Cal. Welf. & Inst. Code \u00a7 600 (West 1972).\nMany commentators believe that, because of the many different circumstances which may justify intervention, general language is necessary in statutes authorizing intervention in the parent-child relationship. E.g., Katz, When Parents Fail 64 (1971) (\u201c[Broad] neglect statutes recognize that \u2018neglectful\u2019 behavior can also vary, and thus cannot be easily or specifically defined. . . . The broad neglect statutes allow judges to examine each situation on its own facts.\u201d); Levine, Caveat Parens: A Demystification of the Child Protection System, 35 Pitt.L.Rev. 1, 17 (1973).\n. The criticism has generally centered on its invocation to deny due process to infants. See, e. g., In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 16, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 1437-38, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967) (\u201cThe Latin phrase proved to be a great help to those who sought to rationalize the exclusion of juveniles from the constitutional scheme; but its meaning is murky and its historic credentials of dubious relevance.\u201d).\n. E. g., Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 64 S.Ct. 438, 88 L.Ed. 645 (1944) (anti-child labor legislation); Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968) (variable obscenity standard to protect children).\n. E. g., requiring children to attend some school, at least to a certain age. Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 534, 45 S.Ct. 571, 573, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 213, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1532, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972).\n. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals there upheld the involuntary termination of parental rights, finding that 1) the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard for involuntary termination is not unconstitutionally vague or violative of due process and 2) a finding of parental unfitness is unnecessary to a determination that the child\u2019s interests will be served by termination of parental rights. Accord, In re Petition of New England Home for Little Wanderers, 328 N.E.2d 854 (Mass.1975).\n. Appellants also argue that the language of section 311(2) requires a showing of a \u201chigh and substantial degree of misconduct.\u201d This contention was expressly rejected in In Adoption of R.I., 468 Pa. 287, 361 A.2d 294 (1976). See part II, infra.\n. In determining whether the findings of the orphans\u2019 court are supported by competent evidence, we must take as true all the evidence supporting the findings and all reasonable inferences therefrom. See Kay v. Kay, 460 Pa. 680, 334 A.2d 585 (1975). Mr. Justice Nix, in his dissenting opinion, departs from this standard by drawing his own inferences contrary to the findings of the orphans\u2019 court. An appellate court is not free to draw inferences contrary to the findings of the orphans\u2019 court supported by competent evidence.\n. Notice of the termination proceedings was sent to the last known addresses of the fathers of Frank and William. Neither father responded. Notice was sent to a man alleged to be the father of Mark. The man denied by affidavit that he was Mark\u2019s father, relinquished any parental rights he might have to Mark, and waived any right to further notice in this or any subsequent proceedings involving Mark.\n. The caseworker testified that the home was roach infested, that appellant had seen a rat near the refrigerator, and that appellant agreed that the housing was unfit for children. Appellant did not contradict this testimony.\n. According to the caseworker, appellant at first could not decide whether to take the apartment, or wait for housing which could accommodate all four children. She finally decided to take the smaller apartment, in which she still resides.\n. According to the nutrition aid supervisor, the program encompasses more than advice on food and diet planning. The aids advise on a variety of matters, including child care, money management, and housekeeping.\n. For example, at one time school authorities would not allow Tracie to go to school because she had lice. The supervising nutrition aid encountered great difficulty explaining to appellant, and having her perform, the necessary procedures to rid Tracie of the lice, which involved shampooing and using a special comb, to get the nits out of Tracie\u2019s hair. Appellant seemed unable to understand the necessity of removing the nits. When Tracie still had nits after two weeks, and was upset about missing school, the aid treated Tracie.\nSimilarly, appellant has made no significant progress in learning how to budget and manage her money. In the past, appellant\u2019s heat and electricity were frequently turned off because she neglected to pay her bills. On one occasion, appellant came to the nutrition aid supervisor requesting emergency financial assistance because she believed she owed money for rent, gas, water, and lights. When the aid contacted various utilities and appellant\u2019s landlord (the housing project director) she learned that, in fact, appellant did not owe money to any of them. Workers at the Salvation Army told the nutrition aid that appellant came to them frequently with similar requests. There was no indication that appellant intended to defraud anyone; rather, she simply was unable to keep track of her income.\nThe nutrition aids suspected that others often took advantage of appellant\u2019s inability to manage her money. On several occasions appellant told the nutrition aids of giving money to people for such things as toys, which were never delivered. Appellant\u2019s sole income is a monthly Supplemental Security Income (SSI) allowance. One nutrition aid observed on three different occasions that a creditor came to appellant\u2019s house on the day her check arrived and appellant turned over her check to him. He took the checks, cashed them, and, after deducting money allegedly due, returned what was left.\n. Appellant began failing test items at the five year level and low six year level. She passed a few items at the seven and eight year level, but did not pass any of the test items at the nine year level and above.\nIn 1963, when hospitalized after suffering from apparent hallucinations, appellant was administered the Weschler Adult Intelligence Test, which rated her IQ at 57. The psychologist testified that both scores placed appellant in the range of the educable or trainable mentally retarded.\n. Although the psychologist did not testily directly concerning appellant\u2019s mental health, there is evidence suggesting that appellant suffers from some mental instability. In 1963 appellant was hospitalized for a month after suffering from the delusion that she was pregnant and about to deliver. The supervising nutrition aid testified that appellant once asked her to locate a certain boyfriend of appellant\u2019s. Upon investigation, the aid discovered that the boyfriend did not exist. Another aid testified to a story appellant had told her, which appellant repeated under examination by Children\u2019s Services\u2019 counsel at the hearing, of having seen her mother kill her father when appellant was a young girl, after which her mother buried him in the family\u2019s back yard. The circumstances surrounding appellant\u2019s relation of this story rendered it incredible.\n. Appellant contends that such an interpretation is constitutionally compelled. This argument was rejected in part I, supra.\n. To the extent that both acts relate to state intervention in the parent-child relationship, the Juvenile Act and the Adoption Act may be considered in pari materia. 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1932 (Supp.1977). See Adoption of R.I., 468 Pa. 287, 295 n.9, 361 A.2d 294, 298 n.9 (1976).\n. Our courts have long recognized that a biological parent\u2019s claim to a child can be weakened by long separation causing the parent\u2019s relationship with the child to dwindle, while the child develops other, more stable ties. In Commonwealth ex rel. Children\u2019s Aid Society v. Gard, Chief Justice Maxey, writing for the Court, observed that a child will become strongly attached to those\n\u201cwho stand in parental relationship to it and who have tenderly cared for it. Its bonds of affection [may] have become so strong that to sunder them suddenly may result not only in the child\u2019s unhappiness, but also in its physical injury. . . . Nothing could be more cruel than the forceable separation of a child from either its reeil or foster parents by whom it has been lovingly cared for and to whom it is bound by strong ties of affection; to a child it is equally cruel whether the separation is brought about by \u2018kidnapping\u2019 or by legal process. In passing on the contested custody of children no judge can do justice without considering the human aspect of this problem.\u201d\n362 Pa. 85, 97-98, 66 A.2d 300, 306 (1949). See Davies Adoption Case, 353 Pa. 579, 588, 46 A.2d 252, 257 (1946); Stapleton v. Dauphin County Child Care Services, 228 Pa.Super. 371, 324 A.2d 562 (1974).\nIn Smith Adoption Case, this Court recognized that parental rights may be terminated if a parent does not affirmatively act to meet the child\u2019s essential needs but rather allows others to meet those needs. We there stated:\n\u201cParental rights may not be preserved by complete indifference to the daily needs of a child or by merely waiting for some more suitable financial circumstances or convenient time for the performance of parental duties and responsibilities (while others adequately provide the child with her immediate and continuing physical and emotional needs). The parental obligation is a positive duty and requires affirmative performance which may not be delayed beyond the statutory period by the parent if the parental right is not to be forfeited.\u201d\n412 Pa. 501, 506, 194 A.2d 919, 922 (1963).\nAlthough Gard and Stapleton involved custody disputes, and Davies and Smith involved abandonment, the principle that a parent\u2019s claim to his child is weakened by long separation and development by the child of other, closer, attachments applies equally to a proceeding under section 311(2) which, \u201cis intended to center judicial inquiry upon the welfare of the child, rather than the fault of the parent.\u201d Joint State Government Commission, Official Comment, Adoption Act (1970).\n. The orphans\u2019 court found as a fact that the \u201cmother began to request the return of the children in November of 1974.\u201d\nAppellant\u2019s caseworker testified that appellant made no request for the return of her sons before November, 1974. Appellant testified that she had \u201casked to have them all back, but just like I say, the caseworker just gives you the run around, and I went to Legal Aid Society, went in the middle part of January.\u201d She did not indicate when she first requested their return before going to legal aid in January, 1975.\n. The foster parents of Mark, who has been with the same foster family since 1971 when he was one year old, and the foster parents of William, who was five years old at the time of placement in 1971, have told Children\u2019s Services they are interested in adopting the boys. Frank referred to his foster mother as \u201cmom\u201d and expressed his clear preference to remain with his foster parents.\nAppellant\u2019s own testimony indicated attenuation of the relationship between herself and her sons. Appellant demonstrated little knowledge of the habits and interests of her sons, other than that they liked to watch TV and play baseball. She was unaware of what grade in school any of the boys was in, or how they were doing in school.\n. This conclusion is consistent with our decisions in Adoption of R.I., 468 Pa. 287, 361 A.2d 294 (1976) and In re Geiger, 459 Pa. 636, 331 A.2d 172 (1975). In Adoption of R.I., we rejected the requirement of a showing of \u201cwillful misconduct\u201d because it \u201cwould deny R.I. the benefits of a family through adoption and continue the long period of temporary care to protect a possible reunion which has been shown will not occur.\u201d 468 Pa. at 298 n.11, 361 A.2d at 299 n.11. Although in holding that R.I. had been deprived of essential parental care we relied on evidence of physical deprivation leading up to her removal from the home, nothing in our opinion indicates that her long stay in foster care was irrelevant to this question, and we clearly relied upon the long stay in foster care in determining that the neglect or incapacity of her natural mother was irremediable.\nIn Geiger, we reversed an order terminating a mother\u2019s parental rights. The termination was based on opinion evidence that the house was \u201c \u2018submarginal\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018was setting a cultural standard for these children which would be a deprivation in the future.\u2019 \u201d 459 Pa. at 640, 331 A.2d at 174 (emphasis in original). There, the child welfare agency had removed the children from the home on this basis and sought termination of the rights of both parents. The propriety of the removal was not before us. However, unlike here, there was no allegation that the children had spent any substantial time out of the home or that, with agency assistance, the family could not be reunited.\nAppellant\u2019s assertion that, before her rights can be terminated pursuant to section 311(2), it must be shown that her children suffered some substantial harm such as deprivation of food, clothing, or shelter while in parental custody, is contradicted by Appeal of Diane B., 456 Pa. 429, 321 A.2d 618 (1974). Like appellant, the mother in Diane B. voluntarily placed her child in the custody of the children\u2019s agency. Nonetheless, this Court held that the mother\u2019s subsequent conduct in failing to support her child or maintain a close relationship with the child caused the child to be \u201cwithout essential parental care\u201d and justified termination of the mother\u2019s rights under section 311(2).\n. In reviewing whether the evidence supports the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s decree, we have placed only limited reliance on appellant\u2019s IQ score. Experts generally agree that socially and culturally disadvantaged people tend to score lower on standardized intelligence tests, which suggests that cultural bias may affect the result. See Galliher, Termination of the Parent-Child Relationship: Should Parental I.Q. be an Important Factor?, Law and the Social Order 855, 865-66 (1973). Moreover, \u201cNo Study has ever documented the premise that unintelligent parents are unable to give love and affection.\u201d Id. at 871. Consequently, we consider appellant\u2019s test score only as a factor among many relevant to her incapacity to meet the essential needs of her children.\n. The juvenile proceedings were not incorporated in the record, but the record does indicate that custody was taken from appellant because previous court-ordered efforts by Children\u2019s Services to help improve the physical conditions in the home had been unsuccessful and because Judith participated with her older brothers in the commission of a juvenile offense.\n. Appellant has one other older daughter, Shirley, who apparently lived elsewhere at that time.\n. Appellant has not argued that, even if grounds justifying termination under section 311(2) have been shown, it would be in Judith\u2019s best interests to deny the petition. We note only that the orphans\u2019 court considered this possibility and concluded that, particularly in light of the progress which had been made by Dorothy and Boyd outside the home, Judith\u2019s best interests would be served by adoption.\n. We do not imply that evidence of delinquent behavior, standing alone, justifies an inference of parental incapacity to provide proper care, control and supervision of the child, for the causes of juvenile crime are too myriad, complex, and imperfectly understood. See generally, M. Wolfgang and L. Radzinowicz, Crime and Justice (1971). Here, however, appellant\u2019s own testimony indicated that appellant was unable to control the children and, at least with regard to Judith, Boyd, and Dorothy, their antisocial behavior ceased whenever they were outside appellant\u2019s home and in the custody of others."}
