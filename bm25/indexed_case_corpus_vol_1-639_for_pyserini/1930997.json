{"id": "1930997", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eoberts,\nStephen J. Bucci sued his former employer, the E. J. Eeynolds Tobacco Company, seeking to obtain benefits allegedly due him under the company\u2019s profit-sharing plan. Eeynolds countered with the assertion that Bucci had been discharged for dishonesty and that under the terms of the plan he could therefore receive nothing. The facts surrounding Bucci\u2019s discharge and especially whether or not any allegations of dishonesty had been made at that time, were hotly contested at the trial. The jury apparently accepted Bucci\u2019s version of the facts, since it returned a verdict for him in the full amount of the claim. Eeynolds\u2019 motions for a new trial and for a judgment n.o.v. were denied and it took this appeal.\nReynolds now argues that no reasonable man could find from Bucci\u2019s evidence that Reynolds acted \u201carbitrarily, fraudulently or in bad faith,\u201d and that evidence of Reynolds\u2019 conduct subsequent to the dismissal should have been excluded as inapplicable to the issue of whether the discharge transgressed the above standards. Reynolds, however, is precluded from utilizing this rather stringent standard of review because they failed to plead this theory prior to the trial. The principal issue as framed by the pleadings and confirmed by the pretrial conference report was whether or not Bucci, who was discharged for \u201cdishonesty,\u201d had in fact been dishonest. Bucci\u2019s theory was that Reynolds\u2019 unjustified discharge resulted in his being damaged, the amount of the damages being measured by the pension benefits to which he was no longer entitled. This was a perfectly acceptable theory and the verdict rendered thereon was unobjectionable.\nJudgment affirmed."}
