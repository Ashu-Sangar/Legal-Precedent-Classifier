{"id": "1945625", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Pomeroy,\nOn June 9,1965, appellant Myles Taylor, represented by court-appointed counsel, entered a plea of guilty to murder generally, the degree of guilt being subsequently fixed at murder in the second degree. Appellant made no post-trial motions and took no appeal.\nOn October 22, 1969, appellant filed a PCHA petition, alleging numerous grounds for reversal of his conviction. At the hearing on the petition, these grounds narrowed to only two contentions: (1) that appellant\u2019s guilty plea was on incompetent advice of counsel and was not knowing and intelligent, and (2) that it was induced by a confession unconstitutionally obtained by police interrogators at a time when appellant was unrepresented by counsel. The lower court denied post-conviction relief after holding the hearing required by \u00a79 of the Act, and that denial is appealed to this Court. We affirm.\nAt the time of his arrest and the police interrogation which followed it, Myles Taylor was 15 years old and unrepresented by counsel. It is his contention here that either as a matter of law or under the \u201ctotality of circumstances\u201d test of Commonwealth v. Darden, 441 Pa. 41, 271 A. 2d 257 (1970), he could not be said to hare waived his right to counsel under Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 12 L. Ed. 2d 977 (1964), and that therefore his confession was obtained through constitutionally impermissible means. Although this Court has in the past refused to erect a per se rule of incapacity to make such a waiver based solely on age, Commonwealth v. Darden, supra, Commonwealth v. Moses, 446 Pa. 350, 287 A. 2d 131 (1971), the question of waiver of such rights has been troublesome. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Moses, supra, at 356 (Roberts, J., dissenting opinion). Appellant here, however, entered a guilty plea to murder generally on advice of his counsel. Because that guilty plea \u201cis . . . [an] admission in open court that he committed the acts charged in the indictment,\u201d appellant\u2019s uncounselled confession will be unavailing to him unless he can, at the same time, avoid the counselled guilty plea. Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748, 25 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1970); Commonwealth v. Stokes, 426 Pa. 265, 232 A. 2d 193 (1967).\nIn Commonwealth v. Marsh, 440 Pa. 590, 271 A. 2d 481 (1970), we set out the concurrent requirements for attacking a guilty plea allegedly based on an unconstitutional confession. Appellant must demonstrate all of the following: (1) that the confession was unconstitutionally obtained; (2) that the confession was the primary motivation for the guilty plea; and (3) that the entry of the guilty plea was on incompetent advice of counsel. See also Commonwealth v. Moroz, 444 Pa. 493, 281 A. 2d 842 (1971); McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1970); Parker v. North Carolina, 397 U.S. 790, 25 L. Ed. 2d 785 (1970). In a case of this sort, therefore, our initial inquiry \u201cis directed to the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s assessment of his client\u2019s case and his advice to the client in light thereof, including advice as to the implications and consequences of entering a guilty plea.\u201d Commonwealth v. Ward, 442 Pa. 351, 354, 275 A. 2d 92 (1971). Here we find that appellant falls well short of showing that counsel\u2019s advice as to pleading guilty was incompetent.\nMyles Taylor was represented at the time his plea was entered by two counsel appointed by the court in January, 1965. The record of the post-conviction hearing shows that they investigated the facts surrounding appellant\u2019s arrest and filed a motion to suppress the confession for the reason that it was obtained by the police at a time when appellant was not represented by counsel. After a hearing on June 5, 1965 (extending through 165 pages of transcript), the court denied the motion to suppress, finding that Myles Taylor\u2019s waiver of counsel was knowing and intelligent, notwithstanding the testimony to the contrary of a doctor of psychology who examined appellant at the request of his counsel. The motion to suppress unsuccessful, the two attorneys then discussed the possibility of a guilty plea with appellant and with his mother and grandfather, and subsequently recommended that course of action.\nUnder our test for determining the effectiveness of counsel, it appears that the advice offered appellant with regard to his plea was not constitutionally deficient. Here the two court assigned counsel knew the relevant law regarding appellant\u2019s uncounseled confession and they properly attempted to capitalize on that law by presenting at a suppression hearing testimony upon which pivotal facts going to the validity of the confession could be found. The suppression court, however, found those facts adversely to appellant. Faced with a confession in the prosecutor\u2019s hands, the constitutionality of which had been upheld under first testing, counsels\u2019 choice among the alternatives then available was a reasonable one. See Commonwealth v. Sampson, 445 Pa. 558, 285 A. 2d 480 (1971); Commonwealth v. Allen, 443 Pa. 447, 277 A. 2d 818 (1971); Commonwealth v. Alvarado, 442 Pa. 516, 276 A. 2d 526 (1971) ; Commonwealth v. Smith, 442 Pa. 265, 275 A. 2d 98 (1971); Commonwealth v. Lovett, 442 Pa. 105, 275 A. 2d 329 (1971); Commonwealth v. Skipper, 440 Pa. 576, 271 A. 2d 476 (1970); Commonwealth v. Woody, 440 Pa. 569, 271 A. 2d 477 (1970); Commomwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 235 A. 2d 3\u00e19 (1967). It follows that appellant\u2019s counsel acted within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.\nBecause one element of the Marsh three-element test is thus absent, it is not necessary to reach the further issues of whether the confession was unconstitutionally obtained and whether that confession primarily motivated the guilty pleas.\nThe denial of appellant\u2019s Post Conviction Hearing Act petition is therefore affirmed.\nPost Conviction Hearing Act, Act of January 25, 1966, P. U. (1965) 1580, 19 P.S. \u00a71180-1 et seq.\nIn his PCHA petition and at the hearing, appellant argued that his rights to a direct appeal had been denied by failure of his counsel to inform him of that right, and that he therefore should be entitled to an appeal nunc pro tunc. The argument fails for the reason that appellant was convicted of second degree murder on a plea of guilty to murder generally. On direct appeal the only avenues of attack open would have been the validity of the guilty plea and the power of the court to sentence as it did. Commonwealth v. Culpeper, 434 Pa. 15, 252 A. 2d 624 (3969). These avenues, of course, are also open on a POHA petition, 19 P.S. \u00a71180-3, and since those issues are also raisable in this proceeding, no purpose would be served by granting permission to appeal nune pro tune. Commonwealth v. Dillinger, 440 Pa. 336, 341, 269 A. 2d 505 (1970).\nAppellant\u2019s conviction predates by a year the decision in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), which was held in Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 16 L. Ed. 2d 882 (1966) not to require retroactive application. Hence, the constitutional standard by which appellant\u2019s waiver of counsel would be tested\u2014were the issue reached here\u2014would stem from Escobedo, as interpreted by our Court. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Schmidt, 423 Pa. 432, 224 A. 2d 625 (1966) ; Commonwealth v. Campbell, 442 Pa. 313, 275 A. 2d 64 (1971).\nThe Supreme Court of the United States, in testing the competency of an attorney who has advised a guilty plea, has used language to the effect that counsel will not be found constitutionally ineffective unless he was \u201cin gross error\u201d or has committed \u201cserious derelictions.\u201d McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 772, 774, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763 (1970). To some extent these phrases have been echoed in our opinions. See Commonwealth v. Moroz, 444 Pa. 493, 496, 281 A. 2d 842 (1971) (\u201cgross error\u201d) ; Commonwealth v. Brown, 443 Pa. 21, 27, 275 A. 2d 332 (1971) (\u201cgross error\u201d) ; Commonwealth v. Ward, 442 Pa. 351, 353, 275 A. 2d 92 (1971) (\u201cserious derelictions\u201d) ; Commonwealth v. Marsh, supra, 440 Pa. at 594 (adopting the McMann language explicitly).\nOn a careful re-reading of McMann v. Richardson, however, we have doubts that the above quoted phrases were intended to fix a new or higher standard. Other language in that opinion would indicate application of a standard more consonant with then existing tests for the competency of counsel. See McMann, supra, at 770 (\u201cthe good faith evaluations of a reasonably competent attorney\u201d) ; and at 771 (\u201cwithin the range [of competence] demanded of attorneys in criminal cases\u201d). The phrases suggesting the requirement of \u201cgross error\u201d and \u201cserious derelictions\u201d were, we think, in response to the particular facts involved in McMann. There it was argued that counsel who had recommended a guilty plea and who had based his opinion on the New York procedure prior to Jackskon v. Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 12 L. Ed. 2d 908 (1964), was incompetent. Reasonable attorneys, save in the rarest of instances, rely on the then existing law, and one who would attempt to show the existence of one of those rare instances necessarily has a difficult task.\nRather than attempt to perpetuate whatever real (rather than purely semantical) difference there may be between our Pennsylvania test for the effectiveness of counsel found in Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, supra, and the language of \u201cgross error\u201d and \u201cserious dereliction\u201d in McMann, we prefer to rely on the single standard of Maroney and the cases applying it.\nIt does not follow, of course, that as a matter of law counsel who advises a guilty plea following an unsuccessful suppression motion can never be found to be incompetent. But where as here the success of the motion turned on questions of fact, and the Commonwealth did adduce evidence to support a finding adverse to the defendant, counsel\u2019s decision to advise a guilty plea, other factors excluded, cannot be faulted."}
