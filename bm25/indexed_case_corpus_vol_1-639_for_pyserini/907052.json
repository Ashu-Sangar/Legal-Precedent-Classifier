{"id": "907052", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nIn this case, plaintiff company\u2019s rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense was discharged by the court, and an exception taken as required by the act of April 18,1874, sec. 2. The specifications allege error (1) in discharging the rule, and (2) in not entering judgment, in favor of plaintiff company, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.\nFor reasons given by the learned president of the court below, in his opinion discharging the rule, we think he was quite right in substantially holding that the averments of fact contained in defendant\u2019s affidavits were sufficient to prevent a summary judgment, and thus carry the case to a jury.\nThe appeal is accordingly dismissed at plaintiff\u2019s costs, but without prejudice to its right to trial by jury, and a second ap- - peal after final judgment."}
