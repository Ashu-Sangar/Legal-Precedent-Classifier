{"id": "4184756", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nThe Commonwealth appeals from the order granting a stay of execution, vacating appellee\u2019s death sentence, and awarding a new penalty hearing under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 9541-9546. We vacate the stay of execution and the grant of a new penalty phase, and reinstate the sentence of death.\nAppellee was sentenced to death after being convicted of the robbery and murder of Amos Norwood February 3, 1986, his second murder conviction. A detailed account of the crime is set forth in our opinion on direct appeal. See Commonwealth v. Williams, 524 Pa. 218, 570 A.2d 75, 77-79 (1990). Suffice it to say, appellee and his co-conspirator, Marc Draper, took Norwood to a graveyard, tied him with his own clothes, and beat him to death with a tire iron \u2014 appellee returned the next day and set fire to the corpse. At trial, appellee testified that Draper and another individual committed the crime; he claimed he was elsewhere at the time and uninvolved. He testified he did not know the victim, had never seen him before, and had no reason to be angry with him or wish to harm him. This Court affirmed the judgment of sentence February 8,1990, id., at 84, and appellee did not seek certiorari. He filed a timely PCRA petition March 24,1995.\nAt the 1998 PCRA hearing, now represented by the Federal Community Defenders Office (FCDO), appellee abandoned his trial testimony and argued Norwood engaged in homosexual acts with him, and as set forth below, presented evidence supporting this claim. The PCRA court denied relief, and this Court affirmed. Commonwealth v. Williams, 581 Pa. 57, 863 A.2d 505, 523 (2004). Appellee filed a second PCRA petition February 18, 2005, which was dismissed as untimely. This Court affirmed. Commonwealth v. Williams, 589 Pa. 355, 909 A.2d 297 (2006) (per curiam). Appellee filed a third PCRA petition June 1, 2005, which was dismissed as untimely, and we affirmed. Commonwealth v. Williams, 599 Pa. 495, 962 A.2d 609 (2009) (per curiam).\nWhile that PCRA appeal was pending before this Court, appellee filed a federal habeas corpus petition December 19, 2005, which was denied. The Third Circuit affirmed. Williams v. Beard, 637 F.3d 195, 238 (3d Cir.2011). In his federal appeal, appellee contended trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence he was psychologically damaged by years of sexual abuse, which infused him with rage toward men who made sexual advances toward him; appellee argued Norwood was one of these men and had been sexually abusing him since the age of 13. Appellee petitioned the United States Supreme Court for certiorari, which was denied. Williams v. Wetzel, \u2014 U.S.-, 133 S.Ct. 65, 183 L.Ed.2d 711 (2012) (per curiam).\nOn January 9, 2012, the FCDO visited Draper, who was serving a life sentence at SCI-Frackville. That same day, Draper signed an affidavit declaring he told detectives and the prosecution prior to trial that Norwood was a homosexual and was in a relationship with appellee. The affidavit also claimed the prosecution \u201cwanted the motive to be a robbery and kept coming back to that. That\u2019s how they wanted me to testify, that it was a robbery.\u201d Draper\u2019s Affidavit, 1/9/12, at 4. The FCDO revisited Draper March 1, 2012, obtaining another affidavit with similar declarations.\nAppellee then filed this facially untimely PCRA petition March 9, 2012, his fourth state petition for collateral review. On July 27, 2012, he filed a \u201cSupplemental Petition for Post Conviction Relief and Notice of Filing Additional Evidence in Support of Stay of Execution,\u201d although no execution warrant had been signed. An execution warrant was subsequently issued August 8, 2012, setting the execution for October 3, 2012. Appellee filed a \u201cRenewed Motion for Stay of Execution\u201d August 28, 2012, and the Commonwealth filed a response September 7, 2012. On September 6, 2012, appellee filed a motion for discovery, requesting the production of exculpatory information from the Commonwealth \u201cas well as any reports or notes made concerning Norwood\u2019s sexual relationship or sexual abuse of [appellee] or any other child under the age of 18.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Motion for Discovery, 9/6/12, at 5-6.\nOn September 10, 2012, the PCRA court heard argument on the pleadings to determine whether the petition warranted an evidentiary hearing. The court gave appellee time to obtain and submit additional information from Draper, which led to his third affidavit, dated September 11, 2012. On September 14, the court heard additional argument and ordered an evidentiary hearing, which began September 20; only Draper and the trial prosecutor testified. On Saturday, September 22, the court ordered the Commonwealth to produce trial files and Philadelphia Police Department files and allowed both parties to review those files. On September 24, documents from these files were offered and admitted into evidence, and the PCRA court entered 11 exhibits sua sponte. See Exhibit List, 9/20/12. The court then directed appellee to amend his PCRA petition; on September 28, appellee filed an \u201cAmendment and Supplement to Petition for Post-Conviction Relief,\u201d requesting relief because the Commonwealth had given \u201csanitized\u201d witness statements to the defense. The same afternoon, the court ruled there was a Brady , violation because that which was missing from original discovery suggested Norwood may have been a \u201chomosexual ephebophiliac.\u201d PCRA Court Opinion, 11/27/12, at 12-13 (citations omitted).\nThe PCRA court also concluded appellee\u2019s fourth PCRA petition met the \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d exception to the PCRA\u2019s timeliness requirement, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(i), though it did not meet the \u201cnewly-discovered evidence\u201d exception, id., \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(h). The court ordered a stay of execution pursuant to \u00a7 9545(c)(2), finding appellee exceeded the \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d threshold and demonstrated actual success on the merits of his claim regarding the penalty phase. The court held the Commonwealth violated Brady and found appellee identified a specific claim, Norwood\u2019s homosexual ephebophilia, which he was unable to discover or develop due to interference by the Commonwealth. The interference consisted of withholding or \u201csanitizing\u201d three specific pieces of evidence: a statement by Norwood\u2019s wife, a statement by the pastor of appellee\u2019s church, and notes made by the prosecutor.\nThe first statement involved a story Norwood\u2019s wife told police, which was omitted from the 1984 police activity sheet. She said Norwood once woke her at 2 a.m. and asked her for money while a young male stood in the hall outside their bedroom. She saw Norwood load stereo equipment into his car and drive away with the young male. She told police she believed this to be a kidnapping; when Norwood returned home around 9 a.m., he said he was abducted but escaped by using psychology on his captors. When his wife tried to call the police, Norwood asked her to avoid their involvement.\nThe second statement was from appellee\u2019s pastor, who was also a friend of Norwood. The pastor told police Norwood worked with and counseled young males in the church for many years. Omitted from the 1984 activity sheet was the pastor\u2019s suspicion that Norwood may have been a homosexual, and that five years earlier, the pastor received a complaint from a mother alleging Norwood propositioned her 17-year-old son for sex. The pastor also repeated for police the \u201ckidnapping\u201d story told by Norwood\u2019s wife \u2014 this was included with the pastor\u2019s statements in the 1984 police activity sheet, which had been disclosed to the defense.\nThe court also found the Commonwealth failed to disclose handwritten notes by the trial prosecutor, purportedly recounting an instance of Norwood\u2019s behavior toward a teenage male, which would establish the prosecution\u2019s awareness of Norwood\u2019s homosexual proclivities. The court stated, had such evidence been disclosed to the defense, trial counsel would have been able to challenge the Commonwealth\u2019s sympathetic portrayal of Norwood. The court concluded the inability to portray an unsympathetic victim was enough to undermine one\u2019s confidence the jury would have returned the same verdict of death.\nFinding appellee exercised due diligence, the court concluded he did not know this evidence existed until his co-conspirator executed an affidavit in January, 2012, declaring a possible motive for the crime, ie., rage over being sexually abused by Norwood. Appellee timely filed his PCRA petition within 60 days of learning the substance of Draper\u2019s affidavit. Furthermore, the court noted appellee could not have known the Commonwealth interfered with his ability to present evidence of Norwood\u2019s homosexual ephebophilia until the underlying evidence was uncovered during the hearing held as a result of Draper\u2019s affidavit; therefore, appellee timely filed the amendment and supplement to his PCRA petition in order to particularize his Brady claim just three days after government files were opened. Accordingly, the court concluded appellee met his burden under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(i), and subsection (b)(2), so it had jurisdiction to grant relief. Finding appellee established his Brady claim, the court held he was entitled to a new penalty hearing. The court denied relief regarding the guilt phase. The Commonwealth filed this appeal, raising two issues for our review regarding the timeliness of appellee\u2019s fourth PCRA petition and the merits of his Brady claim.\nOur standard of review of the PCRA court\u2019s grant of relief is clear: we examine whether the court\u2019s findings are supported by the record and whether its conclusions of law are free from legal error. Commonwealth v. Colavita, 606 Pa. 1, 993 A.2d 874, 886 (2010). All PCRA petitions, \u201cincluding a second or subsequent petition, shall be filed within one year of the date the judgment becomes final\u201d unless an exception to timeliness applies. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1). \u201cThe PCRA\u2019s time restrictions are jurisdictional in nature. Thus, [i]f a PCRA petition is untimely, neither this Court nor the [PCRA] court has jurisdiction over the petition. Without jurisdiction, we simply do not have the legal authority to address the substantive claims.\u201d Commonwealth v. Chester, 586 Pa. 468, 895 A.2d 520, 522 (2006) (first alteration in original) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). As timeliness is distinct from the merits of the underlying claims, we must first determine whether appellee\u2019s PCRA petition was timely filed in order to decide whether this Court has legal authority to address its substantive claims. See Commonwealth v. Stokes, 598 Pa. 574, 959 A.2d 806, 310 (2008) (consideration of Brady claim separate from consideration of its timeliness).\nThis, appellee\u2019s fourth PCRA petition, was untimely on its face, as it was filed over 20 years after his judgment of sentence became final. The PCRA petitioner has the burden of proving an untimely petition falls within an exception outlined in \u00a7 9545(b)(1). See Commonwealth v. Hawkins, 598 Pa. 85, 953 A.2d 1248, 1253 (2008) (\u201c[I]t is the [petitionerj\u2019s burden to allege and prove that one of the timeliness exceptions applies.\u201d (citation omitted)). Furthermore, any PCRA petition filed under a timeliness exception must be filed within 60 days of when the petition could have first been presented. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2). \u201c \u2018[T]he 60-day rule requires a petitioner to plead and prove that the information on which he relies could not have been obtained earlier, despite the exercise of due diligence.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Albrecht, 606 Pa. 64, 994 A.2d 1091, 1094 (2010) (quoting Stokes, at 310).\nAlthough a Brady violation might fall within the \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d exception, \u00a7 9545(b)(1)\u00a9 nonetheless requires a petitioner to plead and prove: (1) the failure to previously raise the claim was the result of interference by government officials and (2) the information on which he relies could not have been obtained earlier with the exercise of due diligence. Commonwealth v. Abu-Jamal, 596 Pa. 219, 941 A.2d 1263, 1268 (2008) (citation omitted). The merits of a Brady claim need not be addressed until it is established that the instant petition was timely filed. Stokes, at 310. Thus, the proper questions for our review are whether the Commonwealth interfered with appellee\u2019s ability to present a claim that Norwood was a homosexual with a sexual attraction to teenage males, and whether appellee was duly diligent in obtaining such information.\nThe PCRA court held it had jurisdiction under the \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d exception to the PCRA\u2019s time-bar, concluding the alleged Brady violations posited by appellee met the requirements of 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(f). The Commonwealth contends appellee\u2019s PCRA petition failed to establish this exception, as appellee would have known well before trial of any sexual relationship or abuse between Norwood and himself. In fact, the Commonwealth argues, if anyone knew about Norwood\u2019s homosexual proclivities toward teenage males, it was appellee himself. The Commonwealth points to the evidence of appellee\u2019s statements during the murder, taunting Norwood for \u201cliking boys,\u201d and appellee\u2019s plan to extort Norwood by threatening to expose his homosexual activity.\nFurther, the Commonwealth contends appellee not only could have presented evidence of ephebophilia much sooner, but points out appellee did present just such a claim during his first PCRA proceedings in 1998, where he offered testimony from several witnesses alleging Norwood sexually abused him. The Commonwealth also posits that appellee\u2019s instant PCRA petition admitted he knew about Norwood\u2019s homosexual tendencies years before the murder. Since appellee already knew about this alleged material evidence, the Commonwealth contends any \u201csanitization\u201d of evidence by the prosecution does not amount to a Brady violation. Accordingly, the Commonwealth asserts, appellee did not prove the timeliness exception applies, and the PCRA court was without jurisdiction to rule on appellee\u2019s petition, much less grant a stay of execution and a new penalty phase.\nThe Commonwealth also suggests the PCRA court attempted to circumvent a valid death sentence and undermine the integrity of this Court\u2019s ruling in appellee\u2019s first PCRA appeal. The Commonwealth refers to the ordering of what amounted to additional discovery to supplement appellee\u2019s inadequate petition, the court\u2019s lengthy examination of the trial prosecutor after PCRA counsel finished his examination, and the admission of \u201ccourt exhibits\u201d sua sponte, later basing its \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d decision on one of its own exhibits. In sum, the Commonwealth contends the PCRA court \u201cwent to great lengths to expand the record, to reshape [appellee]\u2019s claim, and to limit the Commonwealth.\u201d Commonwealth\u2019s Reply to Defendant\u2019s Response to Emergency Application to Lift Illegal Stay of Execution, 10/2/12, at 12. The Commonwealth, therefore, requests we vacate the stay of execution and the grant of a new penalty phase.\nAppellee argues the PCRA court\u2019s timeliness findings were supported by the record and devoid of legal error. While appellee admits he had prior knowledge of Norwood\u2019s sexual orientation, he contends such prior knowledge is critically different from evidence of homosexual ephebophilia and sexual abuse of other teenage males. He distinguishes the failure to present the defense of rage at trial, his 1998 ineffectiveness claim, from the inability to present Norwood as unsympathetic, and repeats that knowledge of homosexuality is not the same as knowledge of homosexual ephebophilia, insofar as it relates to the ability to paint an unsympathetic picture of Norwood.\nAppellee argues he met \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(i)\u2019s exception because the Commonwealth interfered with his ability to proffer this particular Brady claim, and that he exercised due diligence by presenting the claim within 60 days of obtaining the facts on which the claim was based. Further, appellee asserts a PCRA petitioner\u2019s previous knowledge of a fact applies only to \u00a7 9545(b)(l)(ii)\u2019s newly-discovered evidence exception, not \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(f), alleging the Commonwealth is required to disclose evidence in its possession even if the defense has previous knowledge or other information about that fact, and the failure to disclose such evidence violates Brady, constituting governmental interference with the ability to present a Brady claim.\nOur examination of the three omissions alleged leads to the inescapable conclusion that appellee is not entitled to relief. The missing reports were found to be relevant to Norwood\u2019s character, but the failure to explore or exploit that character was not a result of governmental interference\u2014 there is abundant evidence appellee knew of Norwood\u2019s homosexuality and conduct with teenage boys well before trial, sufficient to present him as unsympathetic before the jury. Appellee himself was a teenage male admittedly engaged in homosexual acts with Norwood. Although he denied any involvement in the crime at trial, evidence included his plan to extort Norwood by threating to expose him for being a homosexual, and statements in which Draper and appellee taunted Norwood for \u201cliking boys\u201d while they were beating him. N.T. Trial, 1/22/86, at 667-68; N.T. Trial, 1/23/86, at 813-14; see also N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/20/12, at 219; N.T. PCRA Hearing Vol. 2, 9/24/12, at 13. Draper testified at trial that appellee told him Norwood was a homosexual. N.T. Trial, 1/23/86, at 814. We agree with the courts that have previously considered appellee\u2019s claims based on sexual orientation \u2014 there is no reasonable conclusion that the result of a trial for this horrific crime would have been different had the missing information been provided as appellee would have liked.\nFurther, evidence offered at appellee\u2019s first PCRA hearing in 1998 demonstrated the extent of available knowledge of Norwood\u2019s sexual appetites. At that proceeding, counsel offered three expert witnesses, all of whom testified appellee and Norwood were in a homosexual relationship in which appellee was abused by Norwood; they suggested the murder was an \u201cenraged killing\u201d in response to the sexual abuse. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/8/98, at 106, 115, 156-59, 186; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/9/98, at 360-61, 375-76; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/13/98, at 540, 542-44, 551-54, 569-70. Additionally, appellee\u2019s high school teacher, who was also a private psychotherapist, testified Norwood molested young boys, including appellee, and he learned this information from several people in early 1997. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/8/98, at 226-33. Appellee\u2019s friend, Donald Fisher, who was. also in a homosexual relationship with appellee for approximately five years, testified appellee and Norwood began a homosexual relationship when appellee was approximately 15 years old, which lasted a few years, and Norwood was abusive, liked to inflict pain, and enjoyed having sex with teenage males. N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/13/98, at 597, 602-05, 617. Fisher also testified appellee would engage in homosexual acts with Norwood for money, alcohol, and other gifts. Id., at 617-18. Fisher learned this information not only from observing the relationship between appellee and Norwood but also because appellee told Fisher. Id. Additionally, the defense stated throughout the hearings that its mitigation witnesses were offered to show Norwood molested young males and to demonstrate trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness in investigating the homosexual relationship between appellee and Norwood and the abuse involved in that relationship. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/8/98, at 235-37; N.T. PCRA Hearing, 4/13/98, at 603.\nAppellee\u2019s prior knowledge was also evident at his federal habeas corpus proceeding, during which he alleged Norwood was a closeted homosexual from whom he could extort cash by threatening to expose Norwood\u2019s secret to his wife. Williams, 637 F.3d at 200. Analyzing the record from appellee\u2019s first PCRA proceeding, the Third Circuit noted appellee and Nor-wood began their homosexual relationship when appellee was approximately 13 years old. Id., at 229. The court stated Norwood was physically abusive toward appellee, once allegedly beating him with a belt. Id., at 229-30. The federal district court also elicited testimony from appellee\u2019s first PCRA proceeding showing Norwood was a homosexual with whom appellee had sex in exchange for money, drugs, and gifts. See Williams v. Beard, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41310, at *106 n. 32 (E.D.Pa. May 8, 2007).\nThe PCRA court itself acknowledged appellee\u2019s arguments from the 1998 PCRA hearing supported his prior knowledge, stating appellee \u201celicited evidence from [ ] Fisher that [ ] Norwood was very degrading and he liked to have sex with kids. However, the current claim does not rest solely upon that evidence.\u201d See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/28/12, at 21. The court also noted the defense, at the time of trial, indeed had information suggesting Norwood was a homosexual \u2014 a statement from a witness disclosing appellee told him Norwood \u201c Vas a homosexual and was the type to pay people.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 27-28. Appellee\u2019s PCRA counsel also referenced his prior knowledge at the hearings. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/10/12, at 24 (\u201c[W]e tried to present in prior proceedings evidence about the sexual abuse by [ ] Norwood of [appellee.]\u201d).\nAnd quite tellingly, Draper\u2019s affidavits established he knew appellee and Norwood were in a homosexual relationship\u2014 \u201c[appellee] had also told me that Norwood was gay\u201d and during the murder, \u201c[appellee] was yelling \u2018so you like boys, so you like boys\u2019 as he hit Norwood\u201d \u2014 and appellee told Draper the murder was about the homosexual relationship. Draper\u2019s Affidavit, 9/11/12, at 2-4. Draper confirmed appellee\u2019s prior knowledge of Norwood\u2019s homosexual proclivities repeatedly in his PCRA testimony. See N.T. PCRA Hearing, 9/20/12, at 219; N.T. PCRA Hearing Vol. 1, 9/24/12, at 88, 98, 96; N.T. PCRA Hearing Vol. 2, 9/24/12, at 12-13.\nThe evidence alleged to comprise the Brady violation does not include information unknown to appellee, or information he would have been unable to find on his own. The \u201ckidnapping\u201d story told by Norwood\u2019s wife indicates that a probably untruthful story was told to her, but nothing more. The PCRA court apparently read between the lines and presumed the story was a lie to hide Norwood\u2019s homosexuality from his wife. And although this story was omitted from the wife\u2019s statements in the 1984 police activity sheet, it was disclosed with the pastor\u2019s statements in the same sheet. That is, appellee was already aware of this story, whatever its value, through other means. See Reverend\u2019s Disclosed Statement, Exhibit C-2, PCRA Hearing, 9/20/12, at 5. Since appellee had it, the government did not interfere with his ability to obtain it.\nThe pastor\u2019s suggestion that he suspected Norwood may have been a homosexual would hardly have surprised appellee, who knew that for years. The government did not keep appellee from ferreting out the reverend, even if his opinion might have been admissible. The pastor\u2019s report that he once received a complaint alleging Norwood propositioned a teenage male would have been equally unsurprising. These allegations confirmed what appellee already knew \u2014 Norwood was a homosexual with attraction toward teenage males, like himself. There simply is no surprise in this revelation, no new information or insinuation that only now suggests Norwood might be made to look \u201cunsympathetic.\u201d\nThe third \u201cinterference\u201d involves nondisclosure of handwritten notes of the trial prosecutor; the PCRA court concluded they recounted a specific instance of homosexual ephebophilia. In toto, the notes read, \u201c[N]ot true \u2014 Mrs. House \u2014 son in play \u2014 Ronald\u201416 yrs.[sic] \u2014 touched on privates \u2014 I don\u2019t do that \u2014 nobody wd [sic] have to know \u2014 brought boy home [and] asked him not to say anything @ [sic] the \u2014 he stopped coming to church \u2014 disappeared\u2014never verified it \u2014 29 yrs. [sic] \u2014 1st X[sic] \u2014 never heard from others @ [sic] possible incidents.\u201d See Exhibit Court-2, PCRA Hearing, 9/20/12, at 2. The court sua sponte admitted these cryptic notes into evidence and used them to question the trial prosecutor.\nThese murky notes, if decipherable with any degree of confidence, do not indicate the origin or veracity of their content; they do not indicate whether the notes were written during a witness interview, much less who was being interviewed. Indeed, they start with the notation \u201cnot true.\u201d They do not mention Norwood, whose connection to the notes we are asked to insinuate. One could infer they involve the incident omitted from the pastor\u2019s statements in the 1984 police activity sheet, where a mother told of Norwood\u2019s propositioning her teenage son. However, next to appellee\u2019s own evidence at the 1998 hearing, it adds little or nothing whatsoever to the information available and already presented. The ability to pursue the mitigating tactic of making Norwood appear unsympathetic was not created by these notes.\nLastly, we note a measure of bootstrapping in appellee\u2019s argument. It is difficult to conclude appellee learned something new from Draper\u2019s latest affidavit, as Draper\u2019s information was derived from appellee\u2019s own statements to Draper prior to and at the time of the murder. Further, Draper\u2019s suggestion that appellee was enraged at the time of the murder depends on Norwood\u2019s prior abuse of appellee, which necessarily establishes appellee\u2019s knowledge of Norwood\u2019s proclivities before trial. Thus, any failure to previously raise this claim was not the result of governmental interference. See Commonwealth v. Grant, 572 Pa. 48, 813 A.2d 726, 730 (2002) (\u201c[N]o Brady violation occurs where parties had equal access to the information or if the defendant knew or could have uncovered such evidence with reasonable diligence.\u201d (citation omitted)); see also Commonwealth v. Morris, 573 Pa. 157, 822 A.2d 684, 696-97 (2003).\nLike appellee\u2019s failed effort to establish a timeliness exception, his Brady claim provides no grounds for PCRA relief because the claim is inapposite to the necessary materiality inquiry. The United States Supreme Court has never held Brady materiality is measured in terms of \u201ceffects on the defense strategy.\u201d See Commonwealth v. Weiss, 622 Pa. 663, 81 A.3d 767, 810-11 (2013) (Castille, C.J., concurring, joined by Eakin, J.). Further, Brady does not permit a defendant to shield himself from his prior perjury at trial. See id., at 811-13.\nAppellee\u2019s Brady theory suggested that had he received additional information about Norwood\u2019s homosexual proclivities, his defense would have learned his actual motive for the murder, i.e., rage over being sexually abused by Norwood, which, in turn, would possibly lead to a new strategy where appellee does not perjure himself and Norwood is portrayed unsympathetically. Yet, at the time of trial, appellee was aware of potential witnesses and information that would establish Norwood\u2019s homosexual attraction to teenage males. Appellee could have used his prior knowledge and his counsel\u2019s due diligence to obtain additional information and witnesses to support a different trial theory than that presented. He could have argued Norwood\u2019s homosexual proclivities developed into sexual abuse, leading to rage and ultimate murder of Nor-wood. He could also have created a portrait of Norwood consistent with that now proffered. However, appellee chose not to do so.\nInstead, appellee perjured himself at trial, testifying he did not know the victim, had never seen him before, took no part in the murder, and had no reason to be angry with him or wish to harm him. The defense he chose to present disclaimed knowledge of Norwood, which is antithetical to what he knew and could have presented \u2014 evidence that showed Norwood as a molester, which may have led to establishing a motive of rage, or evidence allowing him to depict Norwood as an unsavory character and sexual predator. Given the choice of defense, such strategies were not relevant. Given the details of appellee\u2019s crime, showing the jury the victim was \u201cunsympathetic\u201d was not a plan that was likely to cause reciprocal sympathy for the man who bludgeoned him and incinerated his body. Regardless, this alleged \u201csanitized information\u201d claim, coupled with the possible effect on appellee\u2019s defense strategy, lacks any basis under Brady, as it is neither exculpatory nor material. See Weiss, at 810-13 (Castille, C.J., concurring, joined by Eakin, J.). In sum, the Commonwealth did not obstruct appellee\u2019s ability to present Norwood as unsympathetic. Appellee had prior knowledge of the information on which he based his Brady claim, and could have presented the claim much sooner \u2014 prior to trial or at any time over the last 20 years. Because appellee\u2019s theory was built on perjury, and the information on which he relied was not exculpatory, the PCRA court erred in finding his claim material under Brady. Accordingly, the record does not support the PCRA court\u2019s finding appellee established his burden of proof regarding the \u201cgovernmental interference\u201d exception. See Abvr-Jamal, at 1268 (citation omitted). Because the PCRA court was thus without jurisdiction to consider the merits of this petition, see Hawkins, at 1252 (citations omitted), we vacate the court\u2019s order, dismiss this petition as time-barred, and reinstate the judgment of sentence of death. The Prothonotary is directed to transmit the complete record in this case to the Governor pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(i).\nOrder vacated; petition dismissed; judgment of sentence reinstated.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices BAER and STEVENS join the opinion.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a concurring opinion.\nJustices SAYLOR and TODD concur in the result.\n. The court's order included files for both the Norwood murder and the murder of Herbert Hamilton. Both murders had the same trial prosecutor, the same defendant (appellee), and the same key witness (Draper). In the Hamilton murder, appellee was receiving money from Hamilton in exchange for sex; appellee murdered Hamilton when he threatened to expose this relationship. Although the charge was first degree murder, the jury convicted appellee of third degree murder, about one year before the Norwood trial.\n. Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).\n. The PCRA court defined \"homosexual ephebophilia\u201d as a psychological term for the attraction to \u201cyoung men,\u201d both adults and adolescents. See id., at 13 n. 32.\n. Subsection (b)(l)(i) provides an untimely PCRA petition falls within an exception if the petitioner proves: \"the failure to raise the claim previously was the result of interference by government officials with the presentation of the claim in violation of the Constitution or laws of this Commonwealth or the Constitution or laws of the United States!-]\u201d Id.\n. Subsection (b)(l)(ii) provides an exception for an untimely PCRA petition if the petitioner proves: \u201cthe facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown to the petitioner and could not have been ascertained by the exercise of due diligence!.]\u201d Id.\n. Subsection (c)(2) states no stay may be issued unless a PCRA petition meeting all requirements of this subchapter of the PCRA has been filed and is pending, and the petitioner makes \u201ca strong showing of likelihood of success on the merits.\u201d Id., \u00a7 9545(c)(2).\n. The court also stated the Commonwealth interfered with appellee\u2019s Brady claim by \"disput[ing] the existence of information in [its] files about [] Norwood\u2019s homosexual ephebophilia\u201d when the Commonwealth represented to the 1998 PCRA court that the only evidence involved in the case was appellee\u2019s knowledge that Norwood was a homosexual and his plan to extort money from Norwood but mentioned nothing about the additional \"homosexual ephebophilia\u201d evidence. PCRA Court Opinion, 11/27/12, at 15-17. The court added a supplemental opinion to its PCRA opinion, describing additional instances that led it to conclude the prosecution exhibited \"gamesmanship.\u201d See id. app., at 1-15.\n. The Commonwealth\u2019s issues, set forth verbatim, are:\nI. Was [appellee]'s fourth PCRA petition, in which he alleged a violation of Brady[] based on the non-disclosure of information he had known since before trial, untimely?\nII. In any event, was [appellee]\u2019s Brady claim meritless where the information in question would not have been reasonably likely to change the outcome, had no apparent exculpatory value, and had been known all along by [him]?\nCommonwealth's Brief, at 3.\n. The reverend refused to make these statements in writing but related them to police in confidence. He stated, \"[H]e himself handled the matter internally and the complaint never went any further than that.\u201d See Police Activity Sheet, Exhibit P-24, PCRA Hearing, 9/20/12.\n. Although the Commonwealth contends the PCRA court violated Pa.R.Crim.P. 902(E)(1) in the \"Statement of the Case\u201d section of its brief, see Commonwealth\u2019s Brief, at 19, the Commonwealth does not raise a discovery issue on appeal; thus, we will not address discovery matters. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a).\n. Trial counsel indicated at a hearing on appellee's post-sentence motions that he was left with using appellee's youth as a potential mitigating factor \u2014 since appellee provided him little, if any, assistance, he was frustrated in efforts to present a compelling group of character witnesses on his behalf. See N.T. Post-Sentence Motions, 4/24/87, at 21-27."}
