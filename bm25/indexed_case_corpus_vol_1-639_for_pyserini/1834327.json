{"id": "1834327", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThe issue presented in this appeal is whether an employee who sustains an injury covered by the Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 1 et seq., may assert a separate tort action for injuries allegedly arising out of malicious and fraudulent conduct and abuse of the legal process to terminate workmen\u2019s compensation benefits by agents of the employer\u2019s insurance carrier. Based upon our decision in Kuney v. PMA Insurance Company, 525 Pa. 171, 578 A.2d 1285 (1990), we conclude that the exclusivity provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act prohibit a tort action against the agents of the insurance carrier for injuries allegedly caused by their actions in handling the employee\u2019s compensation claim.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Superior Court affirming the order of the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas granting summary judgment in favor of St. Paul Insurance Companies, Vocational Rehabilitation Services, Inc., and John T. Williams, M.D. We granted allocatur limited to the issue stated above as it relates to individuals or entities acting on behalf of an employer or the employer\u2019s insurance carrier.\nOn April 24, 1981, Appellant Calvin Alston fell while working on a ladder and sustained injuries to his wrists, spine, neck and back. St. Paul Insurance Companies (St. Paul), the workmen\u2019s compensation insurance carrier, assigned Alston\u2019s file to Robert Dunham, a claims examiner. Alston began receiving total disability benefits.\nSt. Paul later contracted with Appellee Vocational Rehabilitation Services, Inc. (Vocational Services) to obtain Alston\u2019s medical records, to monitor his recovery, and to report to St. Paul. On January 7, 1982, Edward Resnick, M.D., an orthopedist, examined Alston as requested by Vocational Services. Dr. Resnick reported that his examination did not reveal any significant findings that could be causally related to the symptoms complained of, or to the injury of April 24, 1981. He stated that there was a strong possibility of chronic pain syndrome, but reserved his final opinion until X-rays could be examined. Alston had refused to allow Dr. Resnick to take any X-rays.\nIn February, 1982, Vocational Services assigned Alston\u2019s file to an employee, Appellee Janet Rohrer, a \u201crehabilitation nurse\u201d. Alston was evaluated and treated in February, March, and April, 1982, by J. Brendon Wynne, D.O. Dr. Wynne indicated to Rohrer that he was unable to calculate a firm date on which Alston could return to work. After Rohrer reported Dr. Wynne\u2019s findings to St. Paul, a decision was allegedly made to institute a more aggressive approach toward Alston.\nRohrer arranged to meet with Alston and his wife on May 14, 1982, to discuss his medical treatment and prognosis. At that time, Rohrer indicated that she would like to schedule an appointment for Alston with John T. Williams, M.D., whom she allegedly described as a \u201cmiracle worker\u201d. Alston agreed to be examined.\nOn August 31, 1982, Alston was examined by Dr. Williams. Alston alleged that he was not informed that an independent medical examination would occur, or that Dr. Williams had the ability to sign a physician\u2019s affidavit of recovery, or that he was entitled to have his own physician accompany him to the examination. Dr. Williams conducted a brief examination. Without review of Alston\u2019s prior medical records, X-rays, or contact with the treating physician, Dr. Williams told Alston that he was able to return to work.\nDr. Williams executed a physician\u2019s affidavit of recovery. Subsequently, Robert Dunham approached Alston to negotiate a lump sum settlement of his workmen\u2019s compensation benefits. Alston rejected the offer as insufficient. St. Paul then filed a petition to terminate Alston\u2019s benefits.\nAlston\u2019s benefits were discontinued for nineteen months, until St. Paul\u2019s petition to terminate was denied. The benefits were reinstated and attorney\u2019s fees were awarded to Alston. St. Paul appealed the referee\u2019s decision to the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board. The underlying decision was affirmed, but the award of attorney\u2019s fees was reversed on the Board\u2019s finding of a reasonable contest. No appeal was taken from the Board\u2019s order.\nOn July 6,1984, the Alstons initiated the trespass action for compensatory and punitive damages from St. Paul, Vocational Services, and Dr. Williams. Ms. Rohrer was joined as an additional defendant by Vocational Services. The essence of the Alstons\u2019 claim is the allegation that the defendants conspired to and made misrepresentations to the Alstons to defraud them of workmen\u2019s compensation benefits.\nA motion for summary judgment was filed on behalf of the Appellees. In their motion, the Appellees relied upon the Superior Court\u2019s decision in Rosipal v. Montgomery Ward, 360 Pa.Super. 570, 521 A.2d 49 (1987), alloc. granted, 516 Pa. 635, 533 A.2d 93 (1987), appeal dismissed, 517 Pa. 460, 538 A.2d 495 (1988), holding that an employee\u2019s tort action against her employer was barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The trial court granted the summary judgment motion.\nOn appeal, the Superior Court affirmed. The Superior Court held that the legal immunity that is afforded to employers and their compensation insurers under the exclusivity provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act extends not only to acts of negligence, but also to claims based on intentional, wanton and willful misconduct. Citing its decision in Rosipal, supra, the Superior Court concluded that the immunity extended to cover civil tort actions arising from the handling of a workmen\u2019s compensation claim.\nIn Rosipal, the plaintiff was injured while performing her duties as a security guard. The employer filed a notice of compensation payable and initiated wage indemnity payments. The employer later filed a petition for termination that was supported by a physician\u2019s affidavit of recovery. The plaintiff\u2019s benefits were reinstated following a hearing before a referee.\nThe plaintiff brought a civil action against her employer, alleging economic duress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, procuring a false affidavit of recovery, and breach of compensation agreement. The employer filed preliminary objections, asserting that it was immune from the action under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The trial court dismissed the preliminary objections, but the Superior Court granted the employer\u2019s petition for review and reversed.\nThe Superior Court stated that the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act barred all civil actions flowing from work-related injuries. In rejecting the argument that the injury did not arise from a work-related accident, the Superior Court reasoned that without a work-related accident, there would have been no workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings out of which the civil action arose. The Superior Court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to state a cause of action as all of the allegations in her complaint had as the ultimate basis an injury compensable under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, and her claims must be considered within its framework.\nThe Superior Court expanded on its analysis in Rosipal in the instant case. The court held that when employees sustain injuries during the course of their employment, because of an intentional wrongdoing by their employer, the employee\u2019s exclusive remedy for the injury itself, or for the handling of the claim, lies within the framework of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The Superior Court concluded that the administrative remedies established therein are the exclusive remedies for claimants who believe that their benefits have been wrongfully suspended or terminated by the workmen\u2019s compensation insurer. The Superior Court applied this analysis as well to those individuals or entities employed by the insurer to review the case, such as Vocational Services and Dr. Williams.\nSubsequent to the Superior Court\u2019s decision in the instant case, we addressed the issue of whether an employer\u2019s immunity from tort actions under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act protects its insurance carrier if the insurer is alleged to have engaged in fraud and deceit to deprive an injured employee of his worker\u2019s compensation benefits. In Kuney v. PMA Insurance Co., 525 Pa. 171, 578 A.2d 1285 (1990), we held that the employer\u2019s immunity from tort actions of injured workers extended to the insurance carrier in such instances. We now conclude that our holding in Kuney also encompasses those individuals or entities who perform or assist in performing the functions of the insurance carrier in handling workmen\u2019s compensation claims as agents or employees of the carrier.\nIn Kuney, the employee filed a claim petition after sustaining an injury during his employment. The employer\u2019s insurance carrier, PMA, refused to pay any benefits despite its alleged knowledge that he was entitled to compensation. He was awarded total disability benefits by a referee. The referee also awarded interest on the past-due compensation and ordered the insurance carrier to pay the employee\u2019s litigation expenses and counsel fees. PMA appealed and continued to .withhold payment, allegedly in order to impose extreme financial hardship on the employee.\nThe employee filed a civil action against PMA for damages sustained as a result of PMA\u2019s handling of his compensation claim. Preliminary objections filed by PMA were sustained by the trial court on the basis that the employee\u2019s sole remedy was provided by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. The Superior Court reversed. Kuney v. PMA, 379 Pa.Super. 598, 550 A.2d 1009 (1988). We granted allocatur and reversed the order of the Superior Court.\nWe stated that the exclusivity clause of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a), reflects the historical quid pro quo between an employer and employee whereby the employer assumes liability without fault for a work-related injury, but is relieved of the possibility of a larger damage verdict in a common law action. The employee benefits from the expeditious payment of compensation, but forgoes recovery of some elements of damages. An employer\u2019s liability and the liability of its compensation carrier are exclusively governed by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nIn analyzing whether the employee\u2019s claim arising out of the allegedly fraudulent handling of his compensation benefits was subject to the exclusive remedies of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, we examined the penalty provisions established therein. We concluded that \u201c... the comprehensive system of substantive, procedural, and remedial laws comprising the workmen\u2019s compensation system should be the exclusive forum for redress of injuries in any way related to the work place.\u201d Kuney, 525 Pa. at 175-176, 578 A.2d at 1287, citing American Casualty Co. v. Kligerman, 365 Pa. 168, 172, 74 A.2d 169, 172 (1950). We held that an employee\u2019s claim that the insurance carrier wrongfully delayed payment of benefits must be considered within the framework of the statute.\nWe find that our decision in Kuney is dispositive of the issue raised in the instant case. The Appellant attempts to distinguish this case from Kuney on the basis that the defendant was not a physician or vocational rehabilitation service, and that no penalties are prescribed in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act for third parties. This attempted distinction blatantly disregards the agency relationship existing between the insurance carrier and the vocational rehabilitation service and physician.\nAs in Kuney, the crux of the Alstons\u2019 lawsuit is that the insurance carrier and its agents wrongfully delayed the receipt of compensation benefits. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act establishes the exclusive forum for resolving disputes regarding the employee\u2019s right to compensation and the delay or discontinuance of benefits. The workmen\u2019s compensation system encompasses all disputes over coverage and the payment of benefits, whether they arise from actions taken by the employer, the employer\u2019s insurance carrier, or the insurance carrier\u2019s employees or agents. Only the employer or the employer\u2019s insurance carrier may seek to terminate an employee\u2019s benefits. Therefore, it is of no significance that no penalties are prescribed for the employees or agents of the insurance carrier, for such penalties are available against the employer or its insurance carrier.\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nCAPPY, J., files a concurring opinion.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion in which PAPADAKOS, J., joins.\n. The Superior Court\u2019s decision in Kuney was explicitly overruled in its later decision in the instant case. See, Alston v. St. Paul, et al., 389 Pa.Super. 396, 567 A.2d 663 (1989)."}
