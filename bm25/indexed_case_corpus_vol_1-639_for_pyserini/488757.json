{"id": "488757", "contents": "Mr. Justice Paxson\ndelivered the opinion of the court,\nIt was expressly agreed by the parties that the arbitration should be \u201c final and without exception or appeal.\u201d The agreement was in writing, and comes up with the record. A party is precluded by an express agreement not to appeal and file exceptions. This is settled law. See McCahan v. Reamey, 9 Casey 535, where the authorities are collected by Mr. Justice Strong.\nIt was alleged, however, that the case did not come within the rule above stated, because: 1. The award was procured by fraud; 2. That the arbitrators were guilty of improper conduct; 3. That the defendant did not assent to the agreement to waive exceptions \u2022and appeal, and therefore it bound neither party; 4. After-discovered testimony; and 5. That the arbitrators charged excessive fees.\nThe alleged fraud, as charged, consisted in this: that the defendant procured the award by giving false testimony in his own behalf, at the arbitration ; there was no sufficient proof of misconduct on the part of the arbitrators; the allegation that the agreement for the finality of the submission was not assented to by the defendant is contradicted by 'the record; the after-discovered testimony amounts to nothing, and could not be taken advantage of in this manner if it did, while the alleged over-charge by the arbitrators furnishes no ground for setting aside their award. The proper place to raise this question is upon a taxation of the costs.\nThere is nothing to take the case out of the rule of law above referred to.\nJudgment affirmed."}
