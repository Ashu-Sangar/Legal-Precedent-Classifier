{"id": "1027702", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Potter,\nIn this appeal, substantially the same questions are raised, as in that at No. 420, January Term, 1915, in which an opinion has just been filed. The reasons for the decision in that case are controlling here.\nThe first, second, third and fourth assignments of error are, therefore, sustained, and the judgment is reversed."}
