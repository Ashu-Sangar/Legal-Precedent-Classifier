{"id": "1815597", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nThis disciplinary proceeding presents the question of whether respondent attorney\u2019s admitted egregious misconduct is sufficiently mitigated by evidence of psychiatric illness to justify the sanction of suspension rather than disbarment. We hold that respondent, Seymour H. Braun, presented psychiatric testimony which established that his neurotic depression was a causal factor in his misconduct, and therefore adopt the recommendation of the Disciplinary Board that he be suspended from the practice of law for two years.\nIn November, 1980, respondent undertook to represent an executrix in administering her decedent\u2019s estate. The assets of the estate included cash, shares of stock, and periodic stock dividends. The executrix received the stock dividend checks and forwarded them to respondent, who deposited them in the estate checking account.\nDuring the period from March, 1982 to September, 1984, respondent established a pattern of forging the signature of the executrix in order to withdraw funds from the estate for his own use without her knowledge or consent. On fifteen occasions, respondent forged his client\u2019s signature on checks totalling $1,962.94. From November, 1980 to September 1985, respondent took no action of record in the administration of the estate, failing, inter alia, to pay inheritance tax or to file inventories or accounts. In March, 1985, when the executrix requested reimbursement for funeral expenses she had advanced, respondent deposited $750.00 in the estate account to cover the check he sent.\nIn September, 1985, a second attorney was retained to replace respondent due to his malfeasance and his refusal to communicate with his client. Respondent subsequently reimbursed the estate account in full for the funds he had converted.\nRespondent\u2019s derelictions resulted in investigation and detection by the Disciplinary Board, and, when exposed, respondent admitted the foregoing facts and hearings were held to determine his culpability. He submitted to evaluation by a psychiatrist selected by petitioner, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC), and both the ODC and respondent presented psychiatric testimony in these proceedings. Both psychiatrists agreed that respondent suffered from neurotic depression, and respondent\u2019s psychiatrist, who treated him in 1976 and 1986, testified that the condition persisted during the intervening years while respondent\u2019s misconduct took place and that the psychiatric disability was a causative factor in the misconduct.\nThe foregoing record moved the hearing committee to recommend a two-year suspension despite the fact that the committee found no causal connection between respondent\u2019s mental disability and his professional misconduct. The Disciplinary Board, on the other hand, found that respondent\u2019s mental disability was a factor in causing the misconduct, and also recommended that he be disciplined with a two-year suspension. On July 15, 1988, this Court ordered respondent\u2019s immediate suspension from the practice of law and issued a rule to show cause why he should not be disbarred.\nIn determining the appropriate sanction which should be imposed, the primary question is whether the record supports the finding that respondent\u2019s psychiatric condition of neurotic depression was a factor in causing his admitted egregious misconduct. His conduct transgressed DR 1-102(A)(4), dealing with conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation; DR 1-102(A)(6), dealing with conduct adversely reflecting on the fitness of an attorney to practice law; DR 6-101(A)(3), dealing with conduct involving neglect of a legal matter entrusted to an attorney; DR 9-102(B)(3), dealing with the maintenance of complete records of funds of a client and the rendering of appropriate accounts of the funds; and DR 9-102(B)(4), dealing with the prompt payment or delivery to a client, as requested by the client, funds in the possession of the lawyer which the client is entitled to receive. Such misbehavior, of course, would warrant the most severe sanction, disbarment, rather than suspension, unless significant mitigating factors impinge on the decision. See, e.g., Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Wittmaack, 513 Pa. 609, 522 A.2d 522 (1987) (disbarment for forgery, moral turpitude, fraud or misrepresentation, and failure to disclose conflict of interest); Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Kissel, 497 Pa. 467, 442 A.2d 217 (1982) (disbarment for forgery, conversion, dishonesty or moral turpitude, and actions prejudicial to client); Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Lewis, 493 Pa. 519, 426 A.2d 1138 (1981) (disbarment for failure to distribute monies due and owing to clients, dishonesty or misrepresentation, neglect, and moral turpitude).\nOur review in disciplinary cases is de novo; we are not bound by the findings of the hearing committee or the Disciplinary Board, except as guidelines for judging credibility of witnesses. Office of Disciplinary Counsel v. Wittmaack, 513 Pa. 609, 522 A.2d 522 (1987). Nevertheless, we accord substantial deference to the findings and recommendations of the Board. In this case, the Board found that respondent\u2019s psychiatric disability mitigated his misconduct, as it was a factor in inducing the misconduct.\nThe record supports this finding by the Board. Respondent\u2019s psychiatrist, Dr. Slagle, testified that respondent\u2019s neurosis resulted in \u201cprocrastination, withdrawal, ... [and] giving up.\u201d N.T., 8/27/87, 8. Petitioner\u2019s expert, Dr. McDonough, likewise testified that patients suffering from neurotic depression \u201close interest in their work, socializing, talking ... [and] may just stay home and not go out at all.\u201d Id. at 81.\nThe experts disagreed as to whether the neurosis caused respondent to engage in illegal conduct. Dr. Slagle testified that he \u201cset himself up to be punished\u201d due to guilt feelings because he had \u201ca need to be caught and then the guilt relieved by some punitive force____\u201d Id. at 13-14. Although Dr. McDonough did not agree, he did not entirely rule out the possibility that the \u201cself-punitive\u201d characteristic of neurotic depression could have caused the illegal conduct. Id. at 82-83.\nWe conclude, as the Board did, that the evidence supports the finding that respondent\u2019s neurotic condition was a causal factor in producing the several elements of his professional misconduct. Psychiatric disorder is an appropriate consideration as a mitigating factor in a disciplinary proceeding, and in this case, the psychiatric disorder persuades us to impose a sanction less severe than disbarment.\nWe therefore adopt the recommendation of the Disciplinary Board, and order that respondent be suspended from the practice of law in Pennsylvania for a period of two years.\nPAPADAKOS, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nMcDERMOTT, J., notes his dissent.\n. It should be noted additionally that reinstatement does not automatically follow a period of suspension. Rather, a suspended attorney may, following the expiration of his suspension, file a petition for reinstatement, which will be granted only upon hearings which demonstrate:\nby clear and convincing evidence that such person has the moral qualifications, competency and learning in the law required for admission to practice law in the Commonwealth and that the resumption of the practice of law within the Commonwealth by such person will be neither detrimental to the integrity and standing of the bar or the administration of justice nor subversive of the public interest.\nRule of Disciplinary Enforcement 218(c)(3)(i)."}
