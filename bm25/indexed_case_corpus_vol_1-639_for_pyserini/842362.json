{"id": "842362", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nAs the auditor and court below awarded to the appellant the whole of the fund left after paying the judgment of Haak, the only question remaining for practical consideration was, whether Haak\u2019s judgment was to be considered as paid because of the renewal of the note, against liability on which the judgment was given as security. On that question-we agree entirely with the learned court below, and affirm the final decree for the reasons stated in the opinion.\nDecree affirmed."}
