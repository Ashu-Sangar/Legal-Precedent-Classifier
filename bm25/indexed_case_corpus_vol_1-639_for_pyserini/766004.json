{"id": "766004", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Chief Justice.\nThis is an appeal by allowance from an order of Superior Court which reversed a judgment of sentence for direct criminal contempt that had been imposed on an attorney, Ronald K.M. Williams, by the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.\nOn November 27, 1993, Williams was proceeding pro se in a custody dispute in the court of common pleas. At issue was whether he or his ex-wife would have custody of their child. During the proceedings, when the court sustained an objection to a question that Williams posed to a witness, the following exchange occurred:\nTHE COURT [Judge Braxton]: Objection is sustained.\nMR. WILLIAMS: He\u2019s such a [f......a......].\n[OPPOSING COUNSEL]: I heard him say that you are such a [f-.....a.......]. I heard it as an officer of the court. And the stenographer is nodding her head.\nThat\u2019s exactly what he said, \u201cHe is such a [f-.....a------].\u201d And he said it under his breath. And as an officer of the court, I am standing here, and I am testifying that that\u2019s exactly what he said.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Your Honor, let the record reflect\u2014 [OPPOSING COUNSEL]: I ask that he be held in contempt of court for that.\nMR. WILLIAMS: Your Honor, let the record reflect that [opposing counsel] is standing up yelling and screaming. THE COURT: The record will reflect. Do you have something to say Mr. Williams?\nMR. WILLIAMS: Let the record reflect that at no time did I ever say anything regarding any \u201cJudge Braxton.\u201d\nTHE COURT: Very well, have a seat.\nThe court announced that it would address criminal contempt at the end of the custody proceedings. Nevertheless, it immediately called two witnesses to testify regarding Williams\u2019 comment. The custody hearing then continued to its conclusion, after which the court heard additional testimony regarding Williams\u2019 comment. Williams was then found to be in direct criminal contempt. He was sentenced to undergo a mental health evaluation and spend three days in the county jail.\nAn appeal to Superior Court followed. The judgment of sentence was reversed on the basis that Williams\u2019 comment did not obstruct justice and, thus, that it did not fulfill the statutory test for contempt under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4132. Williams v. Williams, 452 Pa.Super. 52, 681 A.2d 181 (1996). We granted allowance of appeal to review that determination.\nIn pertinent part, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4132 provides\nThe power of the several courts of this Commonwealth to issue attachments and to impose summary punishments for contempts of court shall be restricted to the following cases\n(3) The misbehavior of any person in the presence of the court, thereby obstructing the administration of justice.\nTo sustain a conviction for direct criminal contempt under this provision there must be proof beyond reasonable doubt (1) of misconduct, (2) in the presence of the court, (3) committed with the intent to obstruct the proceedings, (4) that obstructs the administration of justice. Behr v. Behr, 548 Pa. 144, 149, 695 A.2d 776, 779 (1997). We agree with the conclusion of Superior Court that the remark made by Williams did not satisfy this test.\nThe first element, misconduct, was clearly present, inasmuch as it was inappropriate and unacceptable behavior for an attorney or any other person conducting business in a courtroom to make such a remark. See Commonwealth v. Falana, 548 Pa. 156, 162, 696 A.2d 126, 129 (1997) (contemptuous misconduct is behavior that is inappropriate to the actor). Likewise, with regard to the second element, there is no dispute that the objectionable comment was made in the presence of the court. Insofar as the third element, which relates to Williams\u2019 intent, there is less certainty. Opposing counsel claimed that Williams made the remark \u201cunder his breath.\u201d There is no indication that the remark was even heard by the court. The amplitude of such a remark can have a bearing on whether it was intended to obstruct the proceedings. Nevertheless, we have said that \u201cwhen an individual makes a remark in the courtroom while the judge is physically present, he cannot avoid a conviction for contempt simply because the judge did not hear him speak the words in question.\u201d Falana, 548 Pa. at 162, 696 A.2d at 129.\nIn any event it is plain that the fourth element, requiring that there have been an actual obstruction of the proceedings, was not satisfied. For this reason reversal of the conviction was proper. As we stated in Behr, 548 Pa. at 149, 695 A.2d at 779,\nTo obstruct justice, conduct must significantly disrupt proceedings. [In re] Campolongo [, 495 Pa. 627, 435 A.2d 581 (1981)]. We noted in Commonwealth v. Garrison, 478 Pa. 356, 386 A.2d 971 (1978) (plurality opinion), that contempt requires actual, imminent prejudice to a fair proceeding or prejudice to the preservation of the court\u2019s orderly procedure and authority. \u201cRemarks, that are injudicious, or even disrespectful, will not, without more, justify a summary conviction for contempt of court.\u201d Campolongo, at 633, 435 A.2d at 584.\n(Emphasis added). Accord Falana, 548 Pa. at 161, 696 A.2d at 128.\nHere, the inappropriate remark caused no significant disruption of the proceedings. As was stated by Superior Court in reversing Williams\u2019 conviction,\n[A] mere affront to the trial judge is not sufficient to sustain a conviction for criminal contempt. Inappropriate and even ill-mannered conduct which does not obstruct or delay the trial falls short of the misbehavior punishable under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 4132(3)....\n[Williams\u2019] comment in the present case did not obstruct the administration of justice. While there was a momentary break in the proceedings, the hearing resumed quickly. The entire incident encompassed just three and a half pages of hearing transcript out of three hundred and eighty one transcribed that day. After the trial court verified that [Williams] had made the statement, the custody hearing immediately recommenced. Such a transient delay is not an obstruction of justice.\n452 Pa.Super. at 57, 681 A.2d at 183 (citations omitted) (footnote omitted). Further, as the Supreme Court of the United States noted in In re Little, 404 U.S. 553, 555, 92 S.Ct. 659, 660, 30 L.Ed.2d 708, 711 (1972), trial judges are supposed to be persons of fortitude who are able to thrive in a hardy environment, and they must be on guard against confusing offenses to their sensibilities with obstruction of the administration of justice.\nIn short, we believe that the trial court\u2019s personal offense at Williams\u2019 comment erroneously led to the finding of criminal contempt. That is not to say, however, that the comment was less than reprehensible. Williams\u2019 conduct obviously warranted strong disapproval, and the trial court might appropriately have considered referring the matter to the disciplinary board. As a member of the bar, Williams had a responsibility to display respectful conduct in the courtroom. As is stated in the Rules of Professional Conduct, Preamble (1995) \u201cA lawyer should demonstrate respect for the legal system and for those who serve it, including judges, other lawyers and public officials.\u201d\nNotwithstanding Williams\u2019 frustration at receiving an adverse evidentiary ruling in the course of his child custody hearing, it was his responsibility to contain his displeasure and not resort to profanity. His brief departure from that standard, however, through a single remark made \u201cunder his breath,\u201d did not rise to the level of criminal contempt. Superi- or Court properly reversed the judgment of sentence.\nOrder affirmed.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion which is joined by Justice CAPPY and Justice NIGRO."}
