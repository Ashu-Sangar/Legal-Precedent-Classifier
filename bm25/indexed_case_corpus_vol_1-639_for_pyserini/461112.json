{"id": "461112", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from the refusal of the court below of defendant\u2019s motions for judgment n. o. v. and for a new trial. Irene Bowland brought an action against the Trustees in Bankruptcy of the Pittsburgh Railways Company and against the Borough of Carnegie to recover damages which she sustained from a fall on the sidewalk in the latter Borough. She was employed in a restaurant, and on June 4,1941, she and a companion left her place of employment and proceeded eastwardly on Main Street. The first intersecting street was Third Avenue, and just beyond this was the plaintiff\u2019s place of abode. Plaintiff alleged that as she was about to step down from the curb on Third Avenue, her foot caught in an iron band which projected from the curb, causing her to fall and to suffer'injuries.\nOn April 24,1941, a street car of the defendant company jumped the track at Third Avenue and Main Street and caused considerable damage to the sidewalk and the front of a store. The iron band on the curb was torn loose and it projected two or three inches above the curb for a distance of about eight feet. Shortly after the accident the area was roped off. Plaintiff\u2019s witnesses testified that it was not so roped off at the time of the accident, while witnesses for the Borough testified that it was. At the time of plaintiff\u2019s fall it was raining and she and her companion were carrying umbrellas. The place of the accident was illuminated by an arc light and plaintiff\u2019s excuse for not seeing the projecting iron was that the umbrellas cast a shadow upon it.\nThere was no evidence as to the cause of the jumping of the track by the street car, or of any negligence on the part of the defendant company, but there was offered in evidence an ordinance of the Borough of Carnegie, which had been accepted by the defendant company, and this provided that in case of injury to any person or property at anytime, or in any manner, by reason of the construction, repairs, maintenance, or operation of the railway system, the company would indemnify and save harmless the Borough from all liability, costs and expenses arising therefrom. At the trial the respective counsels for the plaintiff and the two defendants stipulated that if plaintiff was entitled to a verdict it should be against the Borough of Carnegie alone, with liability over in favor of the Borough and against the railway company. The effect of this stipulation was to limit the case to a question of negligence on the part of the Borough.\nThe jury returned the verdict of $3,000 in favor of the plaintiff and against the Borough and a verdict over in the same amount in favor of the Borough against the railway company. This appeal followed the court\u2019s refusal of the motions above referred to.\nThe contention of the appellants is that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence. As to this, Judge McNaugher, of the court below, said: \u201cPlaintiff asserted that she had been looking where she was going, that there was a heavy downpour of rain, and that the umbrella which she was using, together with the rain, greatly reduced visibility. Under the circumstances, taking account of the fact that the object over which the plaintiff tripped was dark and not easily observable, we cannot say as a matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.\u201d\nAppellant cites these cases: (1) Lane v. Dickinson, 276 Pa. 306; (2) Davis v. Wilkes Barre, 286 Pa. 488; (3) Mulford v. Philadelphia Rapid Transit Co., 310 Pa. 521; (4) Roth v. Verona Borough, 316 Pa. 279; (5) Brown v. Philadelphia, 267 Pa. 183; (6) White v. Harrisburg, 342 Pa. 556; (7) Lewis v. Duquesne Inclined Plane Company, 346 Pa. 43; (8) Hellriegel v. Kaufmann & Baer Company, 337 Pa. 149; (9) Lautenbacher v. Philadelphia, 217 Pa. 318; (10) Malloy v. Castle Shannon Borough, 344 Pa. 469; and Allshouse v. Wilkinsburg Borough, 343 Pa. 323.\nIn No. 1 the facts were the plaintiff fell on a driveway in \u201cbroad daylight with the walk and driveway perfectly visible.\u201d In No. 2 \u201cthe plaintiff stumbled upon a mound of ice on a sidewalk without looking or attempting to go around it and without heeding the warning of a companion.\u201d In No. 3 \u201cthe accident occurred about noon on a bright, clear day. The depression in which the plaintiff stepped was about six or eight inches deep and about the size of a manhole cover. It was plainly visible.\u201d In No. 4 \u201cthe accident occurred' at high noon of a bright, clear summer day. Plaintiff testified that she \u2018knew the sidewalk was rough and uneven, it really wasn\u2019t fit to walk on.\u2019 She also testified she saw the hole that day \u2018when it was about twelve feet away.\u2019 \u201d In No. 5 \u201cplaintiff testified she was looking ahead and saw the pool of water before stepping into it, but could not tell it covered a hole deep enough to cause a fall. When asked why she did not walk on the \u2018other part of the pavement,\u2019 she replied, \u2018I did not think of it.\u2019 \u201d In No. 6 the plaintiff tripped and fell on a band of macadam 3% inches high over the blocks which extended parallel to the curb. \u201cShe testified that as she proceeded to cross the street she was looking for traffic, \u2018I was not looking at the cartway. I was not looking down at all. I was watching for traffic.\u2019 \u201d In No. 7 the plaintiff was injured while leaving an inclined plane car of the defendant company on a clear afternoon. The car stopped with its floor about three inches below the level of the station platform. She admitted that \u201cshe examined the situation and could see that the floor of the car was a few inches under the level of the platform.\u201d In No. 8 this court held that \u201cplaintiff\u2019s own testimony establishes the fact that she walked heedlessly along with the crowd of persons using the entranceway, with no regard whatsoever for her safety, and utterly oblivious of all possibility of danger.\u201d In No. 9 the plaintiff testified that \u201cshe slipped into a hole and fell while she and her sister were carrying a lounge, about five feet in length and about fifty pounds in weight. The top part of the curve of the lounge, or the pillow part, was in front of her and reached to about her mouth.\u201d She was looking straight ahead when she fell. In No. 10 the plaintiff while carrying her baby in her arms \u201cin the afternoon of a clear day\u201d stepped into a depression in the pavement and fell and was injured. \u201cShe said she noticed \u2018part of the broken sidewalk\u2019 as she approached, but \u2018didn\u2019t see the hole.\u2019 She gave, as the excuse for not seeing it, that \u2018the baby was obstructing my view.\u2019 She admitted that she \u2018could move her and look down.\u2019 \u201d In No. 11 the plaintiff \u201con a bright, clear day tripped over a section of concrete sidewalk which was raised approximately two and one-half inches above the section adjoining it. There was nothing to conceal the irregularity but the plaintiff testified that he did not see it because the two sections of sidewalk were of the same color and because he was hurrying toward Pitt Street which he intended to cross and was part of the time engaged in making observation of traffic conditions along that street.\u201d In all these cases the plaintiffs were adjudged, as a piatter of law, to be guilty of contributory negligence. Tlie facts of all these cases distinguish them from the case at bar, though the facts in No. 10 make that case not so clearly distinguishable as the facts in the other cases. However, there is sufficient difference between that case and the one now before us as not to require us to hold that this case is ruled by it.\nIn the instant case, it was, according to plaintiff\u2019s testimony, \u201cpouring down rain\u201d and the umbrellas she and her companion were carrying \u201cshadowed the light off us\u201d and she \u201ccouldn\u2019t see [the obstruction] because it was raining so hard the street was just teeming with water coming down.\u201d Under the circumstances thus detailed plaintiff\u2019s negligence, if any, was not so clear that the court could declare it as a matter of law and the question became one for the jury.\nThis case is ruled by the following cases and the principles enunciated therein apply. In Bruch v. Philadelphia 181 Pa. 588, 37 A. 818, we held that a plaintiff was not in law guilty of contributory negligence where in walking on the pavement he stepped into a hole and was injured when the circumstances were that an electric light which he was facing \u201cso dazzled his eyes that he could not see clearly in front of him and especially could not see the pavement,\u201d though plaintiff admitted that a pedestrian \u201ccould see it [the hole] by looking at it carefully.\u201d In that case we said: \u201cThe public walking on the pavements of a large city, are not bound to exercise extraordinary care; care according to the circumstances, is all the law enjoins. They have the right to assume the pavements are reasonably safe, and that they, by the ordinary use of their eyes, at an ordinary pace, can safely walk on them.\u201d This statement was quoted with approval by this court in Mullen v. Welsbach St. Lighting Co., 318 Pa. 562, 179 A. 71, where we held that \u201cwhere the plaintiff and a friend were standing and talking to a third party in broad daylight, and \u2018as she [plaintiff] turned to the right to leave, she naturally, in order to make room for her companion, who was standing at her left, took a step backwards and to one side, and thus placed her foot in the hole, which extended nearly half way across the pavement . . . without looking behind her/ \u201d the question of her negligence was one for the jury. In that case we cited Markman v. Bell Stores Co., 285 Pa. 378, 132 A. 178, which held that the fact that a plaintiff who while departing from a store was \u201cburdened with four parcels held in front, extending twelve or fifteen inches from her body to her chin and carried a handbag on the arm\u201d did not make her so clearly guilty of contributory negligence that the court could declare it as a matter of law. In the Mullen ease, supra, this court quoted ivith approval from Iseminger v. York Haven W. & P. Co., 206 Pa. 591, 594, 56 A. 66, the often reiterated principle that \u201cIt is only in clear cases where the facts and the inferences to be drawn from them are free from doubt that the court is warranted in saying that there was contributory negligence.\u201d\nIn support of the motion of a new trial the only argument advanced was that the verdict was excessive. The plaintiff, who was 48 years of age at the time of the accident, was earning $10 a week as a waitress. She also said she received some tips but did not state what these amounted to. By reason of her injury she had to have the semilunar cartilage of the right knee removed. Dr. Wallace, her physician, testified that she now has a \u201cgood knee,\u201d that she has a knee \u201cthat is usable and to all intents and purposes effective,\u201d but he said there are still some complaints by the patient that she has some symptoms of weakness and pain\u201d which the doctor could not verify, though he \u201cwas not ready to deny what the patient said was true.\u201d He estimated that within a period from 6 to 18 months after the trial the difficulty of the plaintiff ought to be cleared up. There was testimony that there was a doctor bill of $48, another of $200 and a hospital bill of $90.30. Plaintiff has not gone back to a steady job but there is no proof that this was due to any physical disability. Our conclusion is that the verdict in this case was excessive and that an award to the plaintiff of $2000 plus $338.30 for her hospital and physicians\u2019 bills is as much as is warranted by this record.\nThe judgment is reduced to $2338.30 and as modified is affirmed."}
