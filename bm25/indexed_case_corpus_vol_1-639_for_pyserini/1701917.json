{"id": "1701917", "contents": "OPINION\nZAPPALA, Justice.\nThe question in this appeal is whether a common pleas court order denying a motion to approve a settlement filed pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3323, is a collateral order appealable as of right under Pa.R.A.P. 313. Superior Court quashed the appeal as interlocutory. We affirm.\nHelen U. Geniviva died on April 24, 1981. Her will named her son, Cosmo S. Geniviva, as executor and he hired attorney Nick A. Frisk, Jr., to assist him in his duties. In 1989, the other beneficiaries under the will petitioned the Orphans\u2019 Court for an inventory and accounting. Ultimately, the executor was required to reimburse the estate for interest and penalties due on account of the estate\u2019s failure to pay taxes, loss caused by failure to timely liquidate securities, and various other amounts. See In re Estate of Helen U. Geniviva, 450 Pa.Super. 54, 675 A.2d 306 (1996), alloc. denied, 546 Pa. 666, 685 A.2d 545 (1996).\nCosmo Geniviva commenced this action against Frisk by praecipe for writ of summons in January of 1991. The complaint, which was not filed until June of 1994 following the aforementioned decision of the Orphans\u2019 Court, alleged that the estate suffered financial losses due to Frisk\u2019s negligence. In February of 1997, pursuant to 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3323, the parties filed a Motion to Approve Settlement. After a conference and indication by the court that the motion would be denied, the parties filed a Motion and Stipulation for Approval of a Revised Settlement. On March 6,1997, the court entered an order denying the motions. The court concluded that the amount of the proposed settlement was inadequate, and that the likelihood of recovery and the amount of potential recovery were greater than argued by the defendant. The court also objected to the proposed allocation of the settlement proceeds.\nFrisk filed an appeal, which Superior Court quashed sua sponte. The court\u2019s per curiam order stated that the appeal was \u201cinterlocutory and not collateral,\u201d citing Knisel v. Oaks, 435 Pa.Super. 169, 645 A.2d 253 (1994).\nPennsylvania Rule of Appellate Procedure 313(a) provides that \u201c[a]n appeal may be taken as of right from a collateral order of an administrative agency or a lower court.\u201d Subsection (b) defines \u201ccollateral order\u201d as \u201can order separable from and collateral to the main cause of action where the right involved is too important to be denied review and the question presented is such that if review is postponed until final judgment in the case, the claim will be irreparably lost.\u201d The Note to the Rule states that it is \u201ca codification of existing case law with respect to collateral orders,\u201d and cites Pugar v. Greco, 483 Pa. 68, 394 A.2d 542, 545 (1978) (quoting Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949)).\nAlthough the \u201ccollateral order doctrine\u201d has often been applied in determining whether the appeal was proper in particular cases, our courts have not provided significant analysis of the elements defining a collateral order\u2014separability, importance, and irreparable loss if review is postponed\u2014 so as to allow for predictable application to different circumstances. In Darlington, McKeon, Schuckers, and Brown, 1 Pennsylvania Appellate Practice Second Edition, \u00a7 313.2, it is observed that \u201c[i]n light of the considerable amount of discretion involved in determining whether an order is a \u2018collateral order\u2019 for purposes of appeal under the collateral order doctrine, it is difficult to predict whether a particular order will be deemed to be appealable under the doctrine.\u201d Although we cannot resolve all of the uncertainty in one fell swoop, this case allows us the opportunity to examine the contours of two of the factors.\nThe Appellant\u2019s argument focuses on the third element of the collateral order definition. He identifies the question involved as whether the court abused its discretion in refusing to approve the settlement, and argues that review of this question will be irreparably lost if the litigation proceeds to final judgment. Because the settlement agreement was conditioned on approval by the court, by definition it will be unenforceable following trial, and the various advantages to the parties of resolving the dispute without trial will have been irretrievably lost. The Appellant argues that Knisel v. Oaks, the case cited by Superior Court, and National Recovery Systems v. Perlman, 367 Pa.Super. 546, 533 A.2d 152 (1987), which the court relied on in Knisel, are both distinguishable. He further argues that as regards the irreparable loss factor this case is more analogous to Lanci v. Metropolitan Insurance Co., 388 Pa.Super. 1, 564 A.2d 972 (1989).\nNational Recovery Systems was a contract action. Although the defendant made an offer of settlement, the parties disagreed about the nature and effect of the plaintiffs response. The plaintiff asserted that the acceptance created a binding agreement and filed a motion to enforce the alleged settlement. The defendant argued that the acceptance was conditional, and thus no more than a counter-offer, which he had not accepted. The common pleas court agreed with the defendant and denied the plaintiffs motion to enforce settlement. Superior Court held that the order was not appealable under the collateral order doctrine. The court concluded that the plaintiffs claim about the validity of the settlement agreement would not be irreparably lost if immediate review were denied because it could be raised either on appeal from an adverse judgment in the underlying action or in a separate action. In either case, a determination that the settlement agreement was enforceable would entitle the plaintiff to damages caused by the defendant\u2019s breach, including the expenses and other burdens incident to trying the case.\nKnisel involved a wrongful death and survival action, as well as an underinsured motorist claim against an insurer. The parties ostensibly agreed to settle the bodily injury claims and the court approved the settlement, but the plaintiffs returned the check tendered by the insurer on account of a dispute over the effect of the release on the underinsured motorist claim. The insurer then filed a motion to enforce the settlement, which the court denied. The court also directed that its previous order approving the settlement \u201cbe held in abeyance\u201d so as not to prejudice the plaintiffs\u2019 underinsured motorist claim. Superior Court quashed the insurer\u2019s appeal, likening the case to National Recovery Systems. The court observed that the ultimate fate of the settlement agreement was undetermined because the common pleas court had held it in abeyance. This analysis, however, failed to account for the fact that holding the settlement in abeyance was tantamount to rejecting the insurer\u2019s interpretation of the settlement agreement, i.e., that the settlement barred the uninsured motorists claim. Nevertheless, even if the court had correctly recognized that the fate of the settlement agreement effectively had been determined against the appellant, as stated in National Recovery Systems the appellant\u2019s interests could still be vindicated either on appeal from an adverse judgment or in a separate action. Thus Knisel is consistent with the rationale of National Recovery Systems even if the opinion did not fully articulate the application of its holding.\nWe have serious doubts, however, about whether the Land opinion accurately represented or applied the rationale of National Recovery Systems in reaching a different result based on different facts. That case arose out of an auto accident between Lanci and an uninsured driver. Lanci agreed to settle all claims with his insurer for $15,000, but later refused to accept the proceeds, asserting that the insurer had misrepresented this amount as the applicable policy limit, when in reality the limit was $250,000. The common pleas court denied the insurer\u2019s motion to enforce the settlement, finding that it was based on a mutual mistake of fact.\nSuperior Court held that the order was appealable under the collateral order doctrine. The court distinguished National Recovery Systems on the grounds that the result of the order denying enforcement in that case was that the matter would proceed to trial, whereas in Lanci, the matter would proceed to an uninsured motorist arbitration hearing. Given that the scope of appellate review from such a hearing would be limited to mistakes of law, the court concluded that the insurer would lose any opportunity to appeal the court\u2019s factual determination of mutual mistake. This conclusion, however, ignored the alternative means of vindicating the insurer\u2019s rights identified in National Recovery Systems, a separate action in the nature of breach of contract. Thus even if the court\u2019s determination of mutual mistake would be unreviewable on appeal (a conclusion that is not beyond question), the insurer\u2019s claim that Lanci should have been required to abide by the settlement would not have been irreparably lost.\nNotwithstanding these reservations about Lanci, it is apparent that that case, as well as Knisel and National Recovery Systems, differs from this case in one significant respect. Whereas each of those cases involved one of the parties refusing to go forward with the settlement, in this case the settlement was not effectuated because of the court\u2019s refusal to approve it. This is not analogous to a breach of contract. Indeed, by its terms the settlement agreement was nullified by the failure to obtain judicial approval. The interest asserted by the Appellant is not his direct interest in the settlement itself, but that the court\u2019s approval not be unreasonably withheld. The question of whether the court abused its discretion would indeed seem to be irretrievably lost if not reviewed immediately. This, however, is not the entire inquiry.\nThe Appellant pays little attention to the second element of the definition of a collateral order, that the right involved be \u201ctoo important to be denied review.\u201d In his Summary of Argument, he states simply, \u201cSettlement agreements foster the desired public policy of efficient, expeditious and judicious resolution of disputes.\u201d Brief at p. 6. The Argument section of his brief likewise contains only one sentence on this point: \u201cThe rights involved in a settlement agreement have long been recognized as too important to be denied review.\u201d Brief at p. 15, citing to Rothman v. Fillette, 503 Pa. 259, 469 A.2d 543 (1983), National Recovery Systems v. Perlman, and Knisel v. Oaks.\nAlthough Rothman v. Fillette acknowledged the \u201cstrong judicial policy in favor of parties voluntarily settling their lawsuits,\u201d 469 A.2d at 546, it hardly stands for the broad proposition set out by the Appellant. The other cases provide just as little support. In National Recovery Systems, Superi- or Court \u201cassume[d] arguendo that appellant\u2019s right to enforcement of the settlement agreement is a right too important to be denied review.\u201d 533 A.2d at 153. In Knisel, the court summarized the National Recovery Systems opinion, noting that' it \u201cassumed for the sake of argument that the second condition had been met,\u201d 533 A.2d at 256, but made no further reference to the \u201cimportance\u201d factor.\nThe United States Supreme Court had occasion to consider the collateral order doctrine in the context of a settlement agreement in Digital Equipment Corporation v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 114 S.Ct. 1992, 128 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994). The district court had dismissed a civil action pursuant to a settlement agreement but later granted Desktop\u2019s motion to vacate the dismissal and rescind the agreement on the ground that Digital had misrepresented material facts during the negotiations. The court of appeals dismissed Digital\u2019s appeal and the Supreme Court affirmed.\nContrary to the appeals court\u2019s heavy reliance on the \u201cimportance\u201d factor and its conclusion that the rights arising out of a private settlement agreement are relatively unimportant, Digital argued that \u201cimportance\u201d was a \u201crogue factor\u201d that should have no bearing on whether an order is immediately appealable. See 511 U.S. at 878, 114 S.Ct. at 2001. The Supreme Court disagreed, observing that whether \u201cimportance\u201d is treated as a separate factor or is considered in conjunction with one of the other factors, it cannot be concluded \u201cthat \u2018importance\u2019 is itself unimportant.\u201d Id. The Court went on to observe that \u201cthe third ... question, whether a right is \u2018adequately vindicable\u2019 or \u2018effectively reviewable,\u2019 simply cannot be answered without a judgment about the value interests that would be lost through rigorous application of a final judgment requirement.\u201d Id. at 878-79, 114 S.Ct. at 2001. Ultimately the Court concluded that even if a settlement agreement could be interpreted as embodying a \u201cright not to stand trial,\u201d there are sound reasons for treating such a privately negotiated right as less important than constitutional or statutory rights to avoid trial, such as double jeopardy or immunity, as to which immediate appealability under the collateral order doctrine had been allowed.\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has recently explored the meaning of the \u201cimportance\u201d factor of the collateral order doctrine in In re Ford Motor Company, 110 F.3d 954, 958-62 (3d Cir.1997). The court observed that in this context, importance \u201cdoes not only refer to general jurisprudential importance. Rather ... an issue is important if the interests that would potentially go unprotected without immediate appellate review of that issue are significant relative to the efficiency interests sought to be advanced by the final judgment rule.\u201d Id. at 959. Surveying the various cases involving application of the collateral order doctrine, the court, invoking the \u201capples against oranges\u201d simile, acknowledged that the balancing process involves a comparison of disparate interests. Essentially, however, the interests implicated in any given case must be considered against the costs of piecemeal litigation.\nWe find the discussions of the \u201cimportance\u201d factor in Digital Equipment and In re Ford Motor Company useful. For purposes of defining an order as a collateral order under Rule 313, it is not sufficient that the issue be important to the particular parties. Rather it must involve rights deeply rooted in public policy going beyond the particular litigation at hand. We note that Digital also raised the argument suggested by the Appellant here, that the right to avoid trial on account of a settlement agreement is important enough for immediate appeal because it advances the public policy favoring voluntary resolution of disputes. The Supreme Court tersely dismissed this contention by stating, \u201cIt defies common sense to maintain that parties\u2019 readiness to settle mil be significantly dampened (or the corresponding public interest impaired) by a rule that a Y decision to let allegedly barred litigation go forward may be challenged as a matter of right only on appeal from a judgment for the plaintiffs favor.\u201d 511 U.S. at 881, 114 S.Ct. at 1992. We believe it likewise defies common sense to maintain that allowing appeals as of right from orders denying enforcement of settlement agreements or, as here, denying approval of a settlement agreement, promotes the \u201cefficient, expeditious and judicious resolution of disputes.\u201d Any efficiencies gained in reduced trial litigation would be at the expense of increased appellate litigation.\nThe United States Supreme Court has stated that the \u201ccollateral order doctrine\u201d must be narrowly applied lest it be allowed to swallow the general rule, Digital Equipment Corp., 511 U.S. at 868, 114 S.Ct. at 1996, and has characterized the requirements for an appealable collateral order as \u201cstringent.\u201d See Midland, Asphalt Corp. v. United, States, 489 U.S. 794, 799, 109 S.Ct. 1494, 1498, 103 L.Ed.2d 879 (1989). Although in Pennsylvania the doctrine has been reduced from case law and set forth in our Rules of Appellate Procedure as establishing a class of orders that may be appealed as of right, it nevertheless remains a specialized, practical application of the general rule that only final orders are appealable as of right. Accordingly, we find it appropriate to interpret Rule 313 narrowly. Claims must be analyzed not with respect to the specific facts of the case, but in the context of the broad public policy interests that they implicate. Only those claims that involve interests \u201cdeeply rooted in public policy,\u201d Digital Equipment Corp., 511 U.S. at 884, 114 S.Ct. at 2004, can be considered \u201ctoo important to denied review.\u201d\nThis case involves no such claims. The common pleas court\u2019s order denying the motion to approve settlement implicates no policy interests of sufficient import that immediate appeal was required. Accordingly, the Order of the Superior Court quashing the appeal is affirmed.\nJustice NEWMAN files a Dissenting Opinion in which Justice CASTILLE joins.\n. Section 3323 of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code provides:\n(a) In general.\u2014Whenever it shall be proposed to compromise or settle any claim, whether in suit or not, by or against an estate ... or any controversy affecting any estate, the court, on petition by the personal representative or by any party in interest setting forth ail the facts and circumstances ... may enter a decree authorizing the settlement to be made.\n(b) Pending court action.\u2014\n(1) Court Order. Whenever it is desired to compromise or settle an action in which damages are sought to be recovered on behalf of an estate, any court or division thereof in which such action is pending and which has jurisdiction thereof may, upon oral motion by plaintiff's counsel of record in such action, or upon petition by the personal representative of such decedent, make an order approving such compromise or settlement....\n. In Digital Equipment Corporation v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.S. 863, 882, 114 S.Ct. 1992, 2003, 128 L.Ed.2d 842 (1994), the Supreme Court applied similar reasoning in concluding that rights arising out of a settlement agreement can be adequately vindicated either on appeal after final judgment or in a separate breach of contract action.\n. The order in question in In re Ford Motor Company involved application of the attorney-client privilege to a discovery request. The court concluded that \"the status or relationship, deeply imbedded in our legal culture, is of sufficient importance that the danger of denying justice by delay in appellate adjudication (which would result in irremediable disclosure of privileged material) outweighs the inefficiencies introduced by immediate appeal.\u201d 110 F.3d at 962.\n. With respect to the first element of the collateral order definition, the Appellant suggests that there has been no disagreement with the view that issues surrounding the settlement agreement are collateral to and separable from the merits of the legal malpractice action itself. , We find it unnecessary to comment further on this point.\n. We think it important to note that a party aggrieved by an order that does not fall into this small class of cases is not entirely without recourse. Under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702(b), Rule 312, and Chapter 13 of the Rules of Appellate Procedure, permission to appeal may be sought on grounds that the order \u201cinvolves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and ... immediate appeal form the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the matter.\u201d Although this procedure invokes the exercise of discretion by both the initial tribunal and the appellate court, absent a stringent interpretation of the definition of a collateral order, Rule 313 would produce the anomalous result of an appeal \"as of right\u201d which involves a \u201cconsiderable amount of discretion\u201d on the part of the appellate court alone. See Darlington, McKeon, Schuckers, and Brown, 1 Pennsylvania Appellate Practice Second Edition, \u00a7 313.2, cited in the text at p. 3."}
