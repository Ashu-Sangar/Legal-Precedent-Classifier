{"id": "848242", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nNothing could be more clear, or more correct, than the charge of the learned court below to the jury on all the legal aspects of the contention between the parties. The same is true as to the charge upon the facts, and the only real question before this court is, whether there was sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s intervention, and direction of the mining, to warrant the court in leaving to the jury the question whether that mining caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury. After having read the testimony on that subject, we think it was not only sufficient to justify the court in submitting the question to the jury, but that the jury did perfectly right in finding their verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant was the owner of the mine, he received the royalty for the coal taken out, it was his interest to have as much coal taken out as was possible, and he did give frequent and explicit directions as to taking coal from the pillars and supports of the mine. Harry Mann, who was conducting the mining operations, testified that Thompson was there very often giving directions especially about taking out the coal. \u201cHe said he wanted all the available bushels that could be got out of there, that we were leaving too much coal in the hill. Q. Well were you leaving too much in ? A. No, sir; if we hadn\u2019t left this coal the place would have come in altogether. If you don\u2019t leave a rib in the first place you can\u2019t never put it in after you take it out.\u201d The witness further said that in pursuance of the defendant\u2019s direction they took coal from the ribs until the mine \u201c shut in,\u201d and that Kistler\u2019s property was just above this. There was much other testimony of the defendant\u2019s active intervention, and that his agent, Led-beater, also gave instructions on the same subject, which were followed. We think it would have been serious error to withdraw the case from the jury with a binding instruction for the defendant, and that both the charge and verdict were entirely correct.\nJudgment affirmed."}
