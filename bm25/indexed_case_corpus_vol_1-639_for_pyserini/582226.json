{"id": "582226", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eoberts,\nWilliam Davis was found guilty of murder in the second degree for the 1964 stabbing death of Eobert Cross. At the time of the murder both Cross and Davis were inmates at the Eastern State Correctional Institution at Graterford.\nFollowing return of the jury\u2019s verdict on January 6, 1965, appellant was unable to appear for sentencing because he had been transferred to Farview State Hospital. There his condition was described as \u201cchronic brain syndrome of unknown cause with psychotic reaction.\u201d In 1972 it was decided that appellant had recovered sufficiently to permit sentencing. He was sentenced on November 6, 1972, to serve a term of five to fifteen years imprisonment. The sentence was to commence upon his parole or the completion of his original sentence. This direct appeal followed. On June 8, 1973, appellant was again transferred to Farview for evaluation and on July 13, 1973, was recommitted for an indefinite term.\nDavis contends that the evidence was insufficient to convict. He argues that post-trial events indicate his entitlement to a Writ of Error Coram Nobis. We need not, however, presently address these questions.\nConsidering the timing of appellant\u2019s transfer to Farview and Ms detention there for seven and one-half years prior to sentencing, a serious question, incapable of resolution on the present record, arises whether he was competent to stand trial. Sometime between his conviction in January 1965 and his scheduled sentencing in October 1965 appellant was declared incompetent in what the sentencing judge described as \u201csome collateral proceedings.\u201d Although it is not clear exactly when appellant was declared incompetent, we cannot on this inadequate record pass on his claim of incompetency at the time of trial. We must therefore remand for an evidentiary hearing and compilation of a supplemental record.\nWe direct that the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County hold an evidentiary hearing to determine whether appellant was competent to stand trial in June 1965 and file its determination with this Court. We will retain jurisdiction of this appeal pending adjudication of appellant\u2019s competence. Following the competency determination, the parties may, if they so desire, have thirty days in which to file supplemental briefs in this Court.\nCase remanded for proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\nThis Court has jurisdiction pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, PX. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(1), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(1) (Supp. 1973).\nThe issue of appellant\u2019s competence to stand trial is properly before us. Prior to trial, Davis informed the court that he believed appointed counsel were conspiring against him and asked to be permitted to conduct his own defense. The trial court granted this request but ordered defense counsel to continue in an advisory capacity. During trial, counsel took over the defense and have filed this appeal. Thus at the time when a motion for a competency hearing should have been made appellant was acting as his own attorney.\nNevertheless, at his preliminary hearing, while acting in his own defense, Davis requested that he be examined by court-appointed physicians because he was \u201cunder mental strain.\u201d He explained that prison personnel and his attorneys were conspiring against him, withholding his mail, and detaining him incommunicado. This testimony indicates that appellant has not waived the competency issue. Furthermore the apparent paranoid delusions are consistent with the diagnosis of appellant\u2019s condition later made at Farview.\nPrior to imposing sentence in 1972, the sentencing judge, who had also presided at appellant\u2019s trial, conducted an on-the-record colloquy to determine Davis\u2019 competence. It appears that appellant was lucid, well oriented, aware of the charges against him, and conscious of the fact that sentence was to be imposed."}
