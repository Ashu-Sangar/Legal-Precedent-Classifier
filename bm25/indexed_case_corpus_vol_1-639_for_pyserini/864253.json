{"id": "864253", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nAfter making sundry bequests, etc., the testatrix gave \u201c all the rest, residue and remainder of\u201d her estate to four persons, by name, \u201c to be divided among them in equal shares absolutely.\u201d She made no provision for survivorship or gift over in case either of the residuary legatees should die in her lifetime. One of them did pre-decease her, and the court, rightly holding that there was a lapse as to that share, awarded the same to a niece who was entitled to take under the intestate law. This, as is clearly shown in the opinion of the orphans\u2019 court, is' in accordance with the well settled law of this state, that, as to a lapsed devise or bequest contained in a residuary clause, the testator must be regarded as having died intestate. There is nothing in the will under consideration to take this case out of the general rule. For reasons given in the opinion referred to, the decree should not be disturbed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant."}
