{"id": "1290524", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Jones,\nIn this action of assumpsit for the recovery of the value of turkeys which the plaintiff claimed, to have sold and delivered to the defendants and which the defendants denied accepting or receiving, the jury re-\u2018 turned a verdict for the plaintiff for the aggregate amount of his claims with interest from various specified dates. The defendants moved for a new trial which the court en banc refused. Judgment on the verdict was duly entered and the defendants have- appealed. They complain of two matters allegedly occurring at trial, neither of which merits the description of assignment of error.\nThe appellants\u2019 first complaint is that the trial judge curtailed defendants\u2019 cross-examination of the plaintiff with respect to his \u201cday book\u201d which was identified as Defendants\u2019 Exhibit \u201cQ\u201d. This allegation is -patently contrary to the unmistakable record. The second complaint is that the defendants\u2019 Exhibit \u201cQ\u201d, which had not been formally offered in evidence, was erroneously sent out with the jury along with all the other exhibits in the case. The triviality of this contention will at once be apparent upon reference to tbe attending circumstances as disclosed by tbe record.\nTbe plaintiff, as a witness in Ms own behalf, testified in direct examination for 19 pages of the printed record. He was then uninterruptedly cross-examined by defendants\u2019 counsel for 41 pages and, after a brief hiatus for the testimony of two intervening witnesses, defendants\u2019 cross-examination of the plaintiff was resumed for another 15 pages. A considerable part of the cross-examination had to do with the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cday book\u201d, which at that stage was referred to by defendants\u2019 counsel as the book with the \u201cgray cover\u201d. In view of what undeniably transpired at the trial, it comes with poor grace from the defendants to assert that their cross-examination of the plaintiff respecting Ms \u201cday book\u201d was \u201ccurtailed\u201d by the court. Actually, the trial judge overindulged defendants\u2019 counsel by permitting him to continue to the length he did with a repetitive and confusing cross-examination for the sole alleged purpose of testing the plaintiff\u2019s credibility. J ust how useless the cross-examination was for the purpose ascribed is best indicated by the jury\u2019s verdict which fully accredited the plaintiff\u2019s testimony. The opinion for the court en banc justifiably regrets \u201cthat the lawyer who tried this case in behalf of defendants did not present the [new trial] motion, nor undertake to make the argument before the court.\u201d Had he done so, he could hardly have had the temerity to suggest that he had been restricted in interrogating the plaintiff.\nThe erroneous idea which appellants have striven to insinuate, namely, that their cross-examination of the plaintiff concerning his \u201cday book\u201d was restricted, rests upon no more than that defendants\u2019 counsel (when the plaintiff was called for limited rebuttal) had the \u201cday book\u201d marked as defendants\u2019 Exhibit \u201cQ\u201d and again sought to cross-examine the plaintiff further about the \u201cday book\u201d although it had not been mentioned in the witness\u2019 direct examination in rebuttal. After defendants\u2019 counsel had proceeded with the obviously objectionable cross-examination for two more pages of the printed record, plaintiff\u2019s counsel interposed an objection on the ground that the interrogation was not proper cross-examination in rebuttal. The court expressed agreement that the examination had gone far beyond the scope of rebuttal but, at the continued insistence of defendants\u2019 counsel, permitted the witness to answer \u201cone more time\u201d and then terminated the improper cross-examination, saying, \u201cAll right, now the objection is sustained and that will be the end of that question.\u201d Thus it is, that for a correct ruling upon a proper occasion, the appellants unfairly criticize the trial judge.\nThe situation is well described in the opinion for the court en banc, as follows: \u201cOn cross-examination plaintiff was thoroughly questioned on his day book without limitation or restriction by the trial court. Defendants had the book marked as their Exhibit Q. Now defendants protest that on rebuttal by plaintiff they were not permitted to make unrestricted inquiry into the day book, which opportunity they already had on plaintiff\u2019s case in chief. Furthermore, plaintiff\u2019s testimony in rebuttal made no mention of the day book. Plaintiff\u2019s rebuttal was confined to oral testimony explaining or answering defense matters not contemplated in his case in chief. Nevertheless the trial judge allowed a wide latitude on the rules of evidence and permitted defense counsel to question the plaintiff concerning the day book. When plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected that the cross-examination was going far beyond the field of rebuttal the court sustained the objection, which it had every right to do. Defendants have no just reason for complaint: Jarvis v. Bell, 296 Pa. 568.\u201d\n. The appellants\u2019 complaint, that Exhibit \u201cQ\u201d, which was not formally offered in evidence, was sent out with the jury along with all of the other exhibits in the case, is utterly lacking in merit and little need be said about it. No objection was ever made on this score until the defendants filed their motion for a new trial. As we have already seen, it-was defendants\u2019 counsel himself who had the day book marked as an exhibit and who cross-examined the plaintiff extensively with respect to items contained therein. The trial judge, sua sponte, might well have directed that the exhibit be formally received in evidence, or plaintiff\u2019s counsel could have offered it as an aid to the jury in passing upon the cross-examination of the plaintiff by defendants\u2019 counsel. Substantially,, that is what happened at the conclusion of the court\u2019s charge. The printed record before us discloses (pp. 131a-132a) that, at the end of the charge,\n\u25a0 \u201c(Juror No. 11 comes before the Court for a conference, off record.)\n\u201c(Conference between Court and counsel, off record.)\u201d\n\u2022 Following that, the court instructed the attending tipstaff to take the jury up to the \u201cjury room with all the exhibits ... . .\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s counsel inquired, \u201cIs Exhibit Q supposed to go out with the jury? (Addressing. Juror No. 11:) Is this what you mean? That is the book that belongs to the plaintiff that was exhibited this morning at [defendants\u2019 counsel\u2019s] request.\u201d To that observation, defendants\u2019 counsel added, \u201cI would like to note that cross-examination by me following the marking of that Exhibit was terminated by the Court\u2019s order.\u201d The court responded, \u201cAll right\u201d; and the jury retired taking .with them all exhibits, including Exhibit \u201cQ\u2019V It is plain enough that defendants\u2019 counsel knew that.Exhibit \u201cQ\u201d was.going out with the jury and made no objection.\n\u25a0 What had happened when Juror No. 11 spoke to the trial judge privately at the conclusion of the charge, as above indicated, is well set out in the opinion for the court en banc as follows: \u201cIt is regrettable, as has been stated, that the lawyer who tried the case for defendants was not present at these motions, but after testimony was closed and before the case went to the jury one of the jurors made inquiry of the judge concerning the day book. At a sidebar conference it was agreed among counsel that the day book, which was Defendants\u2019 Exhibit Q, although not admitted into evidence, could go out with the jury.\u201d\nThe circumstances disclosed by the record leave no doubt in our minds as to the correctness of the trial judge\u2019s recollection of what actually occurred in respect of Exhibit \u201cQ\u201d and the jury.\nJudgment affirmed."}
