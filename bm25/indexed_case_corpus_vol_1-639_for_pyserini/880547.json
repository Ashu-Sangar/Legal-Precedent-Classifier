{"id": "880547", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Stebbett,\nThis case depended on questions of fact which were clearly for the consideration of the jury, and they were accordingly submitted to them by the learned trial judge in a clear, concise and fully adequate charge to which no just exception can be taken. Their verdict necessarily implies a finding of the controlling facts on which plaintiff\u2019s right to recover depended, viz: that defendant company\u2019s negligence was the proximate cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury, and that he was not chargeable with any negligence that contributed thereto. These findings of fact were fully warranted by the evidence. It was impossible for them to have found otherwise without discrediting the testimony as to the dangerously high rate of speed at which defendant\u2019s car was running at the time of the collision, the neglect of the motor man to check its speed, etc.\nThe first four specifications of error are based on the learned court\u2019s refusal to charge as requested in defendant\u2019s points recited therein respectively. As to the first specification, there is nothing in any of the facts, which the testimony tended to prove, that would have warranted the jury in drawing the conclusion that the wagon, which was being driven immediately behind the west-bound car, was such an intervening cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury as could relieve defendant from the consequenees of its negligence in \u201c running at a high and reckless rate of speed.\u201d Nor is there any evidence that the driver of the wagon in question acted improperly in following closely behind the west-bound car. For aught that appears, he had an undoubted right to do so, and his conduct affords no excuse whatever for defendant company\u2019s neglect to exercise that degree of care that was manifestly required in the circumstances. There was no error in refusing to affirm the point. Nor was there any error in refusing to give the binding instructions requested in the second point. The assumed facts, of which it is predicated, were neither admitted nor found by the' jury; nor is there any testimony in the case from which they could have been found. In view of the testimony it would have been plain error to have affirmed either of defendant\u2019s requests for binding instructions. The first to fourth specifications, inclusive, are therefore dismissed.\nThe fifth and last specification, based on a portion of the learned judge\u2019s charge, is without merit. As has already been intimated, the charge as a whole, including of course the paragraph complained of, is not only free from error, but quite as favorable to the defendant as was warranted by any view that can be reasonably taken of the testimony. There is nothing in any of the questions involved that requires discussion.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMitchell, J., dissents, being of opinion that this was a clear case of contributory negligence."}
