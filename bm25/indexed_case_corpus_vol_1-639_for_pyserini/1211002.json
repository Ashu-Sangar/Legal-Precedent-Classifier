{"id": "1211002", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThese appeals are from the judgments of the Superior Court, which affirmed an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County. We have carefully considered each question raised and find that they were all correctly and ably disposed of by the learned Superior Court. It would be idle repetition to restate the facts and law of the case. We therefore affirm the judgments on the comprehensive opinion of Judge Kenworthey, reported in 148 Pa. Superior Ct. 261.\nJudgments affirmed."}
