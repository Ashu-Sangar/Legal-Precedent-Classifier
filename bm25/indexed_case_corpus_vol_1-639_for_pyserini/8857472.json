Selinsgrove, 14 P. F. Smith 166. We are limited to an examination of the decision on points of law and evidence which-were excepted to. We do not look through the whole evidence to discover what facts may have been found. All the points on which the court below was requested to find present questions of law. It was not requested to find the facts on which its conclusions of law were based. It lias not done so. There is therefore no evidence before us on which we can convict the court of error.\nJudgment affirmed."}
