{"id": "1144228", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nDefendant\u2019s truck, traveling southward on Musgrave Street, Philadelphia, collided with the car in which plaintiff was riding eastward on Johnson Street. Each street is thirty feet wide between curbs and they intersect at right angles. Plaintiff was severely injured and has judgment on a verdict. Defendant appeals.\nPlaintiff owned the car in which she was traveling. She had recently purchased it from Leroy Motor Company who employed an agent named Brunner. During the period in which she was entitled to have the car serviced by Leroy Motor Company without charge, she delivered it to the company for that purpose. The company was therefore bailee. She called attention to the fact that there was \u201ca noise in the car\u201d which she wished eliminated; it is also referred to as a \u201crattle,\u201d a \u201cknock\u201d; \u201cit sounded like a shackle bolt\u201d; \u201cit was something in the rear of the car.\u201d On the day of the accident she went to the company\u2019s place of business to obtain the car if ready for delivery to her, and Brunner, who had sold the car to her, said, \u201cThey would try the car\u201d for the purpose of discovering whether the noise had been eliminated. Brunner took charge and drove. Plaintiff sat beside him. Brunner not only drove but selected the streets over which the car was driven and (stating the evidence most favorably supporting the verdict, as the rule requires) while crossing Musgrave Street and about leaving the cartway of that street, having already passed the curbline on the east side of Mus-grave Street, plaintiff\u2019s car was struck on the left rear by the right front fender of defendant\u2019s truck. This truck, as the jury must have found, turned from its southward course on Musgrave Street (on which plaintiff and Brunner had seen it approaching) and headed eastward on Johnson Street at the intersection sufficiently to do the damage. Plaintiff\u2019s car was overturned in Johnson Street and was lying a short distance east of Musgrave.\nIn view of the three-party relation existing between Brunner and the plaintiff and the truck driver, the learned president judge very wisely submitted a number of interrogatories to the jury to be specifically answered in addition to the finding of the general verdict. Among the questions and answers are the following:\n1. Was Bell, the driver of the defendant\u2019s truck, guilty of negligence? Yes.\n2. Was the plaintiff, Ellen E. Brown, guilty of negligence? No.\n3. Was Brunner, the driver of the plaintiff\u2019s car guilty of contributory negligence? No.\n4. Did Ellen E. Brown have a share in the operation of the car? No.\nThis practice has much to commend it and is of great value in the review, both by the court below and here, of the action of the jury and of the trial in general. There is evidence to support each of the findings so made by the jury. As to numbers 2 and 4, we must dismiss, as irrelevant, appellant\u2019s contentions concerning the so-called joint enterprise, common purpose and common employment of plaintiff and Brunner. The bailment had not been terminated; the car was in the custody and control of the Leroy Motor Company, acting by its agent, Brunner. As plaintiff occupied a seat beside him, she was of course held to the exercise of due care in the circumstances, but there is no evidence that she became cognizant of any possible danger in time to warn and then failed to do so (cf. Alperdt v. Paige, 292 Pa. 1, 140 A. 555; Rodgers v. Saxton, 305 Pa. 479, 158 A. 166; Carlson v. R. R. Co., 305 Pa. 431, 158 A. 163).\nWe are not impressed by the criticisms of the charge suggested in appellant\u2019s argument, nor is it necessary to discuss the remaining complaint that the judgment is excessive. The verdict was $21,611; the plaintiff was very seriously injured; the learned court below reduced the verdict to $12,500. No reason has bee'n called to our attention why it should be further reduced.\nJudgment affirmed."}
