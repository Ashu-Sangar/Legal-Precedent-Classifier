{"id": "468929", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Patterson,\nThe Butler County National Bank, guardian of Richard C. Fisher, appellant, filed this petition for a declaratory judgment to det\u00e9rmine the interest of its ward in the estate of Edna H. Fisher, deceased. Paragraph \u201cSecond\u201d of her will gave her entire estate to her sister, Mary E. Fisher, if she survived testatrix. Paragraph \u201cFifth\u201d, standing alone, devised real estate situate at 405 North McKean Street to Richard C. Fisher. The court below construed paragraph \u201cFifth\u201d in conjunction with paragraphs \u201cThird\u201d and \u201cFourth\u201d and held them to be conditioned upon the death of Mary E. Fisher, during the lifetime of testatrix. This appeal followed.\nEdna H. Fisher died testate on January 19,1934. At the time of her death she and her sister, Mary E. Fisher, jointly owned certain real estate situate at 405 North McKean Street, Butler, Pennsylvania. Paragraph \u201cSecond\u201d of her will provided: \u201cI will, devise and bequeath unto my sister Mary E. Fisher should she survive me, all of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of whatsoever nature and wheresoever situate, to be hers absolutely.\u201d Paragraph \u201cFifth\u201d provided: \u201cI will, devise and bequeath to my brother Richard C. Fisher all of my interest and claim in house and lot situate No. 405 North McKean Street, Butler, Pennsylvania, to be his absolutely.\u201d Mary E. Fisher died testate March 13, 1945, and by her will devised all her real estate to G. Clayton Critchlow, in trust for certain uses. Critchlow now claims the entire interest in the said real estate.\nAppellant, contending that the specific devise contained in Paragraph \u201cFifth\u201d was effective to qualify the general devise in Paragraph \u201cSecond\u201d, filed this petition for a declaratory judgment and prayed that the rightful owner of the real estate be determined.\nThe rule that the later of two inconsistent clauses in a will must be taken to represent the last expression of testatrix\u2019s intention, is well established. It is to be invoked, however, only where there is an utter repugnancy : Conner\u2019s Estate, 302 Pa. 534, 537, 153 A. 730, 731; Patton\u2019s Estate, 268 Pa. 367, 369, 112 A. 61, 62. A necessary prerequisite to the application of this rule is its unavoidability. Examination of the entire will must be made so that, if possible, all provisions thereof can be given effect: Sarver\u2019s Estate, 324 Pa. 349, 352, 188 A. 141, 142. Each clause must be considered in connection with the entire document. \u201cA clause in a will is never construed by itself but in connection witb the entire document\u201d: Patton\u2019s Estate, supra, 370. The will must be considered as an entirety and the intent of the testatrix determined therefrom: Polder\u2019s Estate, 343 Pa. 30, 34, 21 A. 2d 907, 910; Patterson\u2019s Estate, 333 Pa. 92, 94, 3 A. 2d 320, 321; Ponner\u2019s Estate, supra, 537. Only in the event that it becomes impossible to give effect to all of the provisions of a will, will the rule of incompatible clauses operate. \u201c. . . the will is to be construed as a whole, and one part is not to be treated as repugnant to another, if it be possible for both to stand\u201d: Mutter\u2019s Estate, 38 Pa. 314, 321.\nConsideration of the \u201cThird\u201d, \u201cFourth\u201d, \u201cFifth\u201d, and \u201cSixth\u201d paragraphs of Edna H. Fisher\u2019s will reveal testatrix\u2019s intention to leave her entire estate to her sister, Mary, if she survived testatrix. She did survive testatrix. These paragraphs are grammatically bound together and evidence a clear intention that they shall be operative only in the event that testatrix survives her sister Mary. The will does not contain utterly repugnant clauses. The principle contended for by appellant is inapplicable. Testatrix has made a consistent disposition of all of her property. Effect can and must be given to all provisions of the will. Considered as an entirety there are no inconsistent dispositions.\nThe provisions of the will reveal the intention of testatrix. Appellant\u2019s contention that the court below erred in considering surrounding circumstances not of record becomes immaterial.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed, costs to be paid by appellant.\n\u201cThird. Should I survive my sister Mary E. Fisher, I then will, devise and bequeath to my brother Richard O. Fisher, all of my interest and claim in the property situate No. 257 South Main Street, Butler, Pennsylvania, to be his absolutely; Fourth. To my brothers Richard C. Fisher and Charles F. Fisher, aU my interest and claim in house and lot situate at No. 401 North McKean Street, Butler, Pennsylvania, together with household goods therein contained, to be theirs absolutely;\n. . . Sixth, I will devise and bequeath all of my interest and claim that I may die possession of, situate in the State of Texas to my brother John O. Fisher to be his absolutely.\u201d"}
