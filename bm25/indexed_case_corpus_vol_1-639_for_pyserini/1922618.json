{"id": "1922618", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThis is an appeal from the Order of the Court of Common Pleas dismissing preliminary objections filed by one of three defendants to plaintiffs\u2019 bill in Equity. We agree with the plaintiffs that the instant appeal must be quashed because (1) it is interlocutory and (2) it does not require an account.\nPlaintiffs are building contractors who entered into a written agreement (a) with several defendants providing for the construction of a building in Radnor Township and (b) with the bank which agreed to finance the construction.\nThe law is well established that an Order which sustains preliminary objections to a suit in Equity or to an action at law without dismissing the. bill or terminating the action is interlocutory and not appeal-able unless expressly made so by statute, or exceptional circumstances existed.
