{"id": "554326", "contents": "Opinion,\nMr. Justice Trunkey:\nSection 8 of the Act of 1848 provides that \u201c In all cases where debts may be contracted for necessaries, for the support of the family of any-married woman, it shall be lawful for the creditor in such case to institute suit against the husband and wife,\u201d and if it be proved \u201c that the debt sued for in such action was contracted by the wife, and incurred for articles necessary for the support of the family of the said husband and wife,\u201d the plaintiff may be entitled to recover.\nIt has been repeatedly decided that both the pleadings and the evidence must show a case of the wife\u2019s liability under the statute. The record must set out a debt contracted by the wife and that it was incurred for articles necessary for the support of her family. But it is not requisite that the evidence adduced to establish the claim shall be entered on the record.\nThe transcript of the justice sets forth that the plaintiff claimed \u201c $226.99 book account for necessaries furnished to the wife and at her request and direction, for the use of herself and family, and for the improvement of her separate estate.\u201d This claim was admitted by the husband; and the wife admitted it, except that she denied having bought the necessaries herself. Upon the evidence judgment was rendered against both. The claim is set out substantially in the words of the statute \u2014 fox necessaries furnished to the wife, at her request, for the use of herself and family. If it be that some of the goods were for improvement of her estate, and that the record is defective for such claim, the judgment is not void. In that case, if aggrieved, the wife\u2019s remedy was by appeal. Where a good cause of action is set out against the husband and wife, and judgment is rendered for a larger sum than the wife is liable for, it will not be summarily struck off, or its collection enjoined. A case may arise where the wife would be entitled to equitable relief, but no facts appear for such relief in favor of the defendant.\nWhen the cause of action is stated according to the requisites of the statute v which define the case where the wife is liable, the record is sufficient. From such statement the reasonable inference is that the goods were sold on the wife\u2019s credit, and it has been often repeated in judicial opinions that the evidence must show that the goods were furnished on the wife\u2019s separate credit. But no case was cited on the part of the defendant where it was ruled that it is necessary to insert the words \u201c on the wife\u2019s separate credit\u201d in the pleadings, and we are advised of no such decision. The cases relied on to support the injunction are Berger v. Clark, 79 Penn. St. 340; Sawtelle\u2019s Appeal, 84 Idem 306, and Hoff v. Koerper, 103 Idem 396:\nIn Berger v. Clark, the declaration showed that the action was founded on an alleged joint contract of the husband and wife, and therefore it was held that the wife was not liable. In speaking of what is essential, it was remarked, \u201c The pleadings must set out a debt contracted by the wife, and that it was incurred for articles necessary for the support of the family of the husband and wife.\u201d Sawtelle\u2019s Appeal was from a decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court, and no question of pleading existed; but it was enunciated that \u201c The Act enables the wife to bind her separate estate for necessaries obtained for herself and family, but the very essence of the liability is that they are furnished at her request and on her credit.\u201d Nor was there any question whether the claim was properly set out in the pleadings in Hoff v. Koerper, where it was ruled that the testimony \u201c was clearly insufficient to sustain the essential averments of the declaration that the alleged indebtedness was contracted by the wife and incurred for articles necessary for the support and maintenance of the family.\u201d\nThe authorities seem to sanction the statement of claim as sufficient, when it follows the terms of the statute relative to her liability for debts incurred for necessaries.\nThe order enjoining the plaintiff from issuing execution process against Mary Ann Xander, is reversed."}
