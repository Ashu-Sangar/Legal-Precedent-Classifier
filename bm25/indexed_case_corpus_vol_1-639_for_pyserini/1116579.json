{"id": "1116579", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Kephart,\nThe City of Philadelphia brought suit to recover from a landowner the amount of a judgment it was required to pay because of an injury occasioned by a defect in the pavement along the owner\u2019s property. Liability was predicated solely on ownership and control of the premises.\nThe property, of which the premises in question were a part, was conveyed to defendant, subject to a lease which provided as follows: \u201cLessor doth hereby demise and let unto lessee, all that certain brick building...... designated on plan hereto attached by the letter \u00a3B\u2019 together with the use of the yard room......designated on the plan as \u00a3A,\u2019 also the yard room......designated on plan as \u00a3C.\u2019\u201d The pavement on which the accident occurred was part of the driveway leading out of yard \u201cA.\u201d The lease had not expired at the date of the injury. Defendant contended it was not liable as it was not in possession. The question of possession and control, as between the owner and the tenant, was submitted to the jury who found for the owner-defendant. The court subsequently entered judgment for plaintiff n. o. v. for the sole reason that the lease gave the tenant nothing but an easement over the yard, and the owner, not being divested of ownership and control, was liable as a matter of law for an injury incurred from a defect in his pavement.\nThe primary duty to keep their sidewalks in repair rests on property owners in possession, while the municipality\u2019s duty is secondary: Dutton v. Lansdowne Boro., 198 Pa. 563, 566; Lohr v. Philipsburg Boro., 156 Pa. 246, 249. Where sidewalks are permitted to get into a dangerous condition, by reason of defects or the presence of snow and ice, they are not sidewalks in ordinary repair; the owner in possession is liable for whatever damages might follow: Pittsburgh v. Reed, 74 Pa. Superior Ct. 444. If the owner is out of possession because of a lease or otherwise his liability ceases, and the tenant or occupier is liable for injuries occurring to a third person on the premises, because of such failure to repair sidewalks: Wolk v. Pittsburgh Hotels Co., 284 Pa. 545, 550. We held in Schott v. Harvey, 105 Pa. 222, that a tenant in possession is, for all practical purposes, the owner of the property.\nThe question resolves itself into an .interpretation of the phrase, \u201cuse of the yard ioom.\u201d The lease gave this to the tenant without restriction or limitation. In general \u201cuse\u201d has been defined as \u201cthe right to enjoy, hold or occupy and have the fruits thereof.\u201d If the thing used is in the form of real estate, the \u201cuse\u201d includes the occupancy or cultivation, or the rent which can be obtained therefrom: Linton v. Howard, 128 N. W. 793, 163 Mich. 556; Words and Phrases, 2d Series. Practically the same language came before the Superior Court for consideration in Beistel v. Westmoreland Motor Car Co., 91 Pa. Superior Ct. 343. That court in an opinion by Judge Linn held: \u201cThe words of a grant are to receive a reasonable construction and one that will accord with the intention of the parties,\u201d which may be ascertained by examination of the circumstances under which the writing was made. \u201cWe agree that by the grant of the \u2018use forever\u2019 (Riggs v. New Castle, 229 Pa. 490, 493; Landell v. Hamilton, 175 Pa. 327, 333)......the grantors intended to and did grant...... the use of the basement......to the exclusion of \u00e1ll others.\u201d In the case at bar, the specific land for use was designated by plan or map, and there was no limitation on the quantity or maimer of use. In Blauvelt v. Water Co., 75 N. J. Eq. 351, 72 Atl. 1091, where the words to be considered were, \u201cthe use of such portion of land,\u201d etc., the chancellor said: \u201cI give the word \u2018use\u2019 as herein employed the meaning of entire, exclusive, complete or any other comprehensive word to express all of the purposes to which land can be put;......by the employment of the word \u2018use,\u2019 the grantor intended to grant and convey the entire use, that is to say, the entire dominion over the land.\u201d\nIt is well settled that a grant or devise of the use of property, without restriction as to the purpose of such use, passes an estate in the property and implies a right of. exclusive possession on the part of the grantee or devisee for the duration of the estate: Stigers v. Dinsmore, 193 Pa. 482.; Hall v. Dean, 72 Pa. Superior Ct. 599.\nEvidence that an adjoining tenant had made use of the yard as a driveway, and that possibly the previous owner had stored goods therein, does not contradict the absolute grant of the lease nor would such acts impose on defendant a liability different from that assumed under the lease; in like manner, such acts would not deprive the tenant of his right under the lease or modify it in any way. As the lessee had the right of exclusive possession, the owner was not liable for injuries suffered from defects in the pavement. In such a case responsibility rests on the occupier or tenant: Phila. v. Bergdoll, 252 Pa. 545; Harte v. Jones, 287 Pa. 37.\nJudgment is reversed and entered for defendant on the verdict."}
