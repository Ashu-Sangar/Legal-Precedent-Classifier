{"id": "963056", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThese appeals involve the same questions and were argued together. The facts that gave rise to them, the contentions of the parties, and the grounds on which they were submitted to the jury are clearly set out in the charge of Judge Reed, specially presiding. We find no error of which the appellants can justly complain, and the judgments are affirmed."}
