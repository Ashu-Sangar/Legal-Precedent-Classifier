{"id": "956215", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe plaintiff, walking at night along Diamond street, stepped into a hole or depression, apparently the cover of a water box which had sunk several inches and was an obstruction in the line of travel. The plaintiff herself was not very clear as to the caus\u00e9 of her fall, but she said \u201c My foot went in and I fell,\u201d but her companions examined the spot immediately and were more explicit.\nOn the question of her own negligence she was also far from clear, but among other answers she said she was just looking the way she walked. On both points it was a case for the jury.\nJudgment affirmed."}
