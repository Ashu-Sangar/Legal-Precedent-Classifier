{"id": "579914", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice O\u2019Brien,\nEllis Bogen, a druggist, was shot and killed during a robbery of his drug store at 2601 West Columbia Avenue, Philadelphia, on December 18, 1969. Appellant, Gerald J. Claitt, was arrested and brought to trial for his participation in this murder and he was convicted by a jury of burglary, robbery and murder in the first degree. Post-trial motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment. This appeal followed.\nThe testimony at appellant\u2019s trial revealed the following facts: Appellant, armed with a .22 caliber revolver, entered the drug store first, followed by one Howard Kennedy, who was armed with a sawed-off shotgun. During the course of the robbery, Bogen was shot by Kennedy. The two men were seen fleeing from the store by a fifteen-year-old girl who worked at a dress shop in the vicinity. Appellant was also identified by William Levin, an employee of the drug store, who viewed appellant for some five to ten minutes during the crime.\nAn accomplice, Ricky Collins, who was present at the planning of the robbery and who played an active part in the robbery, testified as to appellant\u2019s participation in the robbery-murder. In addition, appellant gave the police a formal written statement in which he admitted his participation in the crime. Appellant had sought to suppress this statement and the oral statement that preceded it, but appellant\u2019s motion to suppress was denied after a pretrial hearing.\nAppellant\u2019s first allegation of error concerns what he alleges to be the prosecuting attorney\u2019s improper reference to the oral statement which appellant contends was, in fact, suppressed at the pretrial hearing. However, our examination of the record indicates that, although the court originally indicated an intention to suppress the oral statement, while admitting the written statement, he actually held the entire matter under advisement until he ultimately concluded, after both sides had submitted briefs, that both the oral statement and the written statement were admissible. Since appellant does not contest the correctness of the suppression court\u2019s decision that the written statement was admissible, and since, despite the contentions of appellant, either both statements were admissible or both statements were inadmissible [see Harrison v. United States, 392 U.S. 219 (1968)], we can find no merit in appellant\u2019s allegation of error.\nAppellant\u2019s next allegation of error concerns the Commonwealth\u2019s use of a certain photograph in its cross-examination of Johnny Lee Sanders, who was called by the defense as an alibi witness. Sanders had been in the apartment of one Sandra Hightower from which the five robbers left and to which they returned. Sanders testified that appellant was in his presence while he was playing cards and that appellant never left the apartment during the time of the robbery and the killing of Ellis Bogen. When the five who were ultimately thought to be involved were first rounded up with others and taken to the Police Administration Building for questioning, the police took Polaroid snapshots of all of them. This was a necessary procedure because so many members of the gang were known only by their nicknames that, when talking with a fellow gang member, the police could not be sure of the correct name of the person to whom the member was referring. The assistant district attorney had nineteen of these photographs marked for identification and used some of them in her cross-examination at trial.\nAt the time of the original arrests, Sanders had told the police that he had heard a certain five men planning the robbery. One of these men Sanders had identified as a man named \u201cKadah\u201d and he had identified photograph C-56 as a photograph of \u201cKadah.\u201d At appellant\u2019s trial, when shown the same photograph on cross-examination, Sanders admitted that the photograph was of appellant, but claimed that appellant was not the man known as \u201cKadah.\u201d\nAppellant argues that Sanders\u2019 identification of the photograph was constitutionally infirm under United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 (1967), and Commonwealth v. Whiting, 439 Pa. 205, 266 A. 2d 738 (1970), and that it was error to permit the Commonwealth to refer to this identification in its cross-examination of Sanders. However, in our opinion, the cases upon which appellant relies are inapplicable. Sanders was not asked originally to choose which photograph of a group of photographs shown to him depicted a man whom he had heard helping to plan the crime. Instead, he was asked to provide the names by which the men, depicted in the Polaroid photographs taken previously, were know to him. When the photograph was again shown to Sanders on cross-examination, it was to test his credibility. It was for the jury to determine whether C-56 was the same photograph which Sanders had previously identified as \u201cKadah\u201d and now acknowledged to be appellant but not \u201cKadah.\u201d The use of the photograph in this way did not violate the constitutional rights of appellant.\nAppellant next argues that the trial court erred in allowing a photograph of the deceased to be entered into evidence, and to be used by the jury in their deliberations. As we have said many times, the admission of photographs is left to the discretion of the trial judge and will not be reversed unless he abuses that discretion. See Commonwealth v. Wilson, 431 Pa. 21, 244 A. 2d 734 (1968). In the facts of the instant case, we find no abuse of discretion. The photographs of the deceased merely showed the deceased with a sheet covering all but his head. The picture was neither gruesome nor gory so as to inflame the prejudice of the jurors. While the jury may have had little need of the photograph in their deliberations, it was not error to allow them to use it.\nAppellant also argues that the ninety-nine shotgun pellets removed from the deceased\u2019s body should not have been admitted into evidence. According to appellant, these pellets had an unfairly inflammatory and prejudicial effect on the minds of the jurors. However, the pellets, as the instruments of death, were certainly relevant to the case, as they corroborated the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses as to the facts of the killing. We find no error in the court\u2019s decision allowing them to be admitted.\nAppellant finally alleges error in the selection of the jury panel. The record clearly establishes that these allegations are unsupported by the record.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nMr. Justice Eobeets concurred in the result.\nMr. Chief Justice Jones took no part in the consideration or decision of this case."}
