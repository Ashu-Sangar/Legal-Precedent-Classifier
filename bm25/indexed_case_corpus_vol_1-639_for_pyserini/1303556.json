{"id": "1303556", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nTMs is an appeal from the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County which confirmed absolutely the final account of the trustees in the above estate.\nTestatrix died May 22, 1910, leaving a last will dated the 9th day of November, 1908. She was survived by four children, George, Louisa, Gertrude and William.\nTestatrix in and by the 13th paragraph of her will divided her residuary estate \u201cinto four equal parts or shares\u201d.\n\u201cOne of these four equal parts or shares I give, devise and bequeath unto my son George Henderson, absolutely and in fee simple.\n\u201cThe three remaining equal fourth parts or shares, I give devise and bequeath unto my Trustees ... in TRUST NEVERTHELESS . . .\n\u201cTo pay the said rents, issues, incomes and profits in quarterly payments equally among my children William Henry Henderson, Louisa B. Henderson Shumway and Gertrude W. Henderson Horner for and during the whole term of their lives,. . .\n\u201cAnd upon the further Trust that from and after the death of any of my said children to pay and transfer the principal of such child\u2019s share to the children of such deceased child, or the issue of any deceased child of such child, per stirpes, . . . but' should any of my said three children die leaving no children or other issue, living at the time of such child\u2019s death, I direct that the portion of the principal share of. any such deceased child of mine shall continue to constitute a part of my residuary estate for the benefit of the remaining cestui que trustent in the. trusts in this will mentioned and in the proportion hereinabove \u25a0 designated, subject, nevertheless, to the trusts conditions and limitations hereinabove declared.\u201d\nGeorge died on June 28, 1936, and was survived by two children. Louisa died November 24, 1943, and was survived by two children. William died June 9, 1949, without issue. Gertrude died April 18, 1960, and was survived by three children.\nUpon the death of Gertrude, who was testatrix\u2019s surviving life tenant, the present trustees\u2019 account was filed. The Orphans\u2019 Court awarded William\u2019s share equally per stirpes among the issue of testatrix\u2019s other three children. The sole question involved is whether George\u2019s issue share in the distribution of the principal of William\u2019s share.\nThe pertinent principles applicable in the interpretation of a will have been so recently set forth in Heaton Estate, 404 Pa. 360, 172 A. 2d 293; Wanamaker Estate, 399 Pa. 274, 159 A. 2d 201; Hope Estate, 398 Pa. 470, 159 A. 2d 197; Bald Estate, 385 Pa. 176, 122 A. 2d 294, that a reiteration thereof is unnecessary.\nExamining testatrix\u2019s will, and particularly the 13th paragraph thereof and her scheme of distribution, we find that she gave a one fourth equal part, or share of the principal of her residuary estate absolutely and in fee simple to her son George. This was contrary to the bequest she made for her three other children, and as everyone knows a gift of principal is more advantageous and far more desirable for living expenses and enjoyment than is a gift of income from the same amount of principal.\nTestatrix then gave \u201cthe three remaining equal fourth parts or shares\u201d in trust to pay the income equally among her children William, Louisa and Gertrude, for their respective lives and at their respective deaths to pay the principal of such child\u2019s share to the then living children and issue of such deceased child per stirpes. There then follows the crucial clause: \u201cbut should any of my said three children die leaving no children or other issue, living at the time of such child\u2019s death, I direct that the portion of the principal share of any such deceased child of mine [shall not be paid outright but] shall continue to constitute a part of my residuary estate for the benefit of the remaining cestui que trustent in the trusts in this will mentioned and in the proportion hereinabove designated, subject, nevertheless, to the trusts conditions and limitations hereinabove declared.\u201d\nIt is clear to us that should William die (as he did) without leaving children or issue, the portion of the principal share from which William was receiving the income shall continue to constitute a part of the residuary estate for the benefit of the remaining cestui que trustent. George was not a cestui que trust. He received his share (as above noted) outright, absolutely and in fee simple. Moreover, testatrix added the words \u201cand in the proportion hereinabove designated\u201d meaning, thereby, a division among the survivors of William, Louisa and Gertrude, because G\u00e9orge was indisputably not a cestui que trust (ent), and, in addition, neither George nor his Children or issue were subject \u201cto the trusts conditions and limitations hereinabove declared.\u201d George, and necessarily Ms cMldren, had received the benefit of a far greater gift, namely, the principal of testatrix\u2019s one fourth share outright, and (we repeat) George\u2019s share did not constitute, within testatrix\u2019s language, meaning and intent, a part of her residuary estate \u201cfor the benefit of the remaining cestui que trustent\u201d, whom testatrix had already named, to wit, her children, William, Louisa and Gertrude. Equally important, George\u2019s outright share was not \u201csubject ... to the trusts conditions and limitations hereinabove declared\nThe lower Court came to a contrary conclusion because it felt (a) that testatrix did not intend inequality among his grandchildren and (b) because of the following trust provision wMch appeared in a subsequent part of the residuary contingent gifts.\n\u201cIn the event, however, of the decease of any of my children before me [there were none] leaving lawful issue living at the time of my decease, then I direct my Trustees to use and apply the income of such child\u2019s share for the support, maintenance and education of the issue of such child until each one of said issue arrives at the age of twenty-one years, when I direct that the principal of such child\u2019s share shall be divided into as many equal parts as there are issue of such child then living and be paid and transferred to them respectively in equal shares; . . .\u201d\nSo far as inequality is concerned, testatrix herself created an inequality when she gave one fourth of the principal of her residuary estate outright to her son George, and left the remaining three quarter shares in trust for lier other three children and their children or issue. A court has no right to create equality among grandchildren even if we think that is desirable, unless the testatrix clearly intended to create equality among all her grandchildren, and this she failed to do.\nEven more important, the testamentary trust language upon which the appellee and the lower Court rely, provides for a trust which never came into existence. Furthermore,, this subsequent contingent trust was not \u201csubject... to the trusts conditions and limitations [in the bequests] hereinabove declared\u201d; this trust was created and declared by testatrix in the subsequent provisions of her will and cannot possibly be construed to include cestui que trustent in trusts hereinabove declared with respect to prior portions of her will, nor could it fall within the words \u201cand in the proportion hereinabove designated.\u201d\nDecree reversed, each party to pay own costs.\nItalics throughout, ours.\nWhile no will has a twin brother, Newlin, Estate, 367 Pa. 527, 80 A. 2d 819, this will, in an important respect, is similar to Britt Estate, 369 Pa. 450, 87 A. 2d 243, where we interpreted similar broad language to reach the same conclusion reached herein."}
