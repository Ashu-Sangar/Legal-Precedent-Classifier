{"id": "1742189", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nMANDERINO, Justice.\nAppellant, Raymond Oliver, was convicted of murder in the third degree and possession of an instrument of crime in a nonjury trial on October 1, 1975. Post-verdict motions were filed on October 8, 1975. On January 19, 1976 the post-verdict motions were withdrawn at the request of appellant and sentence was imposed. Appellant received a sentence of seven to fifteen years for the murder and a consecutive five-year sentence bf probation for the possession crime. This direct appeal, involving only the murder conviction, followed.\nAfter submitting a brief in this appeal, appellant\u2019s counsel filed a petition requesting permission to withdraw as appellant\u2019s counsel. For the reasons that follow we deny counsel\u2019s petition and remand the record to the trial court for filing and consideration of post-verdict motions.\nThe brief filed by appellant\u2019s counsel is indeed a strange one, woefully inadequate under the rule set out in Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). It cannot be considered an advocate\u2019s brief. The brief states under the required section \u201cStatement of Questions Involved\u201d only the following:\n\u201cWhether or not counsel for the appellant should be permitted to withdraw from the case and appellant be permitted to proceed in propria persona?\u201d\nIn the section of the brief entitled \u201cSummary of the Argument\u201d the brief states in its entirety:\n\u201cThe question involved is whether or not counsel for the appellant should be permitted to withdraw from the case and appellant be permitted to proceed in propria persona. The appellant withdrew his motions for a new trial and in arrest of judgment. Counsel feels that this action precluded appeal.\u201d\nIn the section of the brief entitled \u201cArgument,\u201d which consists of two pages, counsel points out to this Court several issues which might be raised on behalf of the appellant and then suggests to this Court that there is no merit to these issues. \u201c[T]o call this an advocate\u2019s brief would be to make a travesty of the appellate process.\u201d Commonwealth v. Baker, 429 Pa. 209, 212, 239 A.2d 201, 203 (1968).\nWe cannot accept the brief submitted by appellant\u2019s counsel as an advocate\u2019s brief fulfilling counsel\u2019s responsibility to his client. Under such circumstances, we would ordinarily enter an order directing counsel to comply with Anders, supra, by filing a more adequate brief with this Court. For the reasons that follow, however, we do otherwise in this case.\nThe prosecution has not filed an appellee\u2019s brief in this case. Apparently, it is the policy of some district attorneys\u2019 offices not to file briefs in so-called Anders cases. We strongly condemn this practice. A brief should be filed informing this Court of the prosecution\u2019s position. Although we have no prosecution brief in this case, appellant\u2019s counsel has done some of the prosecution\u2019s work. He has argued that we should not entertain appellant\u2019s appeal in that no issues have been preserved for appeal because of appellant\u2019s withdrawal of post-verdict motions. It is not appellate counsel\u2019s responsibility to write a brief for the prosecution, however. Appellate counsel must submit.an advocate\u2019s brief for the client. Commonwealth v. Perry, 464 Pa. 272, 346 A.2d 554 (1975).\nWe have sua sponte examined the record to determine whether any issues have been properly preserved for appellate appeal. Our examination of the record before us indicates that although appellant withdrew his post-verdict motions, he did so only after being misinformed by the court as to the effect that such a withdrawal would have on his right to appeal. He was told by the trial court that if he withdrew post-verdict motions, he might be limiting his appeal rights.\n\u201cTHE COURT: And by withdrawing those motions that you might be limiting your appeal rights \u2014 you might be limiting what the Court could consider on appeal; do you understand that? (Emphasis added.)\nDEFENDANT: Yes, sir.\u201d\nSuch a statement obviously implies that appellant could still appeal and might not be limited in his appeal. Under these circumstances appellant\u2019s decision to withdraw his post-verdict motions cannot be said to have been knowingly and intelligently made. Commonwealth v. Williams, 459 Pa. 589, 330 A.2d 854 (1975); see also Pa.R.Crim.P. 1123(c)(3).\nIf we were to order counsel to file a new and adequate brief before this Court, after receiving such a brief we would still be confronted with the fact that any issues raised were not first presented to the trial court via post-verdict motions. It would serve no purpose, therefore, to have a new brief presented to this Court.\nSince the prosecution filed no brief before us, it did not raise the issue of whether appellant is precluded from filing an appeal. The issue was raised by appellant\u2019s own counsel. Since we have concluded that appellant\u2019s withdrawal of his post-verdict motions was not knowing and intelligent, we refuse to foreclose appellant\u2019s right to appeal at this time.\nAccordingly, this case is remanded to the trial court for the filing of post-verdict motions. Following disposition of these motions by the trial court, either party may seek appropriate review on appeal.\nPOMEROY, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which EAG-EN, C. J, and LARSEN, J, joined."}
