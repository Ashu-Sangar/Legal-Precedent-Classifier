L. 531, the provisions of the act of March 31,1860, were extended so as to include guardians \u201c in the same manner as executors, administrators and assignees.\u201d The later act therefore embraces the case of a fraudulent guardian ; but the duty of the common pleas, under the 133d section thereof, is not to discharge generally, but onl}- \u201cfrom imprisonment.\u201d It does not appear that appellant has as 3-et been imprisoned, and hence said section is inapplicable to his case.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant."}
