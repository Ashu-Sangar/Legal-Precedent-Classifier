{"id": "1804606", "contents": "OPINION\nNIX, Chief Justice.\nThis appeal had its legal genesis in a trespass action which the appellant, Stephen Poyser, filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County against his employer, Newman & Company, Inc. (\u201cNewman\u201d). By that lawsuit appellant sought to recover damages for a physical injury he suffered while in the course of his employment. The action was grounded partly on a claim of products liability under section 402A of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965), and partly on a theory that Newman had caused appellant\u2019s injury by willfully disregarding governmental safety regulations and by deliberately exposing him to a known hazard. Newman responded to the suit with an Answer containing. New Matter which alleged that the injuries and other losses sustained by the appellant were covered by Newman\u2019s workmen\u2019s compensation insurance policy, and further asserted that the trespass action was barred by the \u201cexclusivity\u201d provision in section 303(a) of The Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (\u201cAct\u201d). Appellant followed with a Reply in which he denied generally the applicability of the asserted statutory bar, but admitted that he had received payments from the employer\u2019s insurance carrier. After the close of the pleadings, Newman moved for judgment on the pleadings, based on the claimed bar of section 303(a) of the Act. The trial court granted the motion and entered judgment accordingly. That order was affirmed by the Superior Court in a memorandum opinion, 344 Pa.Super. 635, 495 A.2d 620 (1985).\nWe granted an allowance of appeal to consider the question of whether the appellant\u2019s second asserted ground for tort recovery, that his injury was caused by deliberate derelictions of the employer, operated to take the personal injury action out of the \u201cexclusivity\u201d provision of section 303(a) of the Act. Although the appellant\u2019s suit also included a products-liability claim, that theory of recovery as such is not offered as a basis for negating the applicability of section 303(a).\nBecause the appellant suffered an adverse judgment on the pleadings, we must, for purposes of review, treat all of his well-pleaded allegations as being true. Cantwell v. Allegheny County, 506 Pa. 35, 483 A.2d 1350 (1984); Karns v. Tony Vitale Fireworks Corp., 436 Pa. 181, 259 A.2d 687 (1969); Bata v. Central-Penn National Bank of Philadelphia, 423 Pa. 373, 224 A.2d 174 (1966). The allegations of the appellant\u2019s Complaint in Trespass set forth the following. On June 7, 1983, the appellant was in the course of his employment at Newman\u2019s factory. While so engaged, he had occasion to be operating a device called a \u201cnotching\u201d machine, which had been designed and manufactured by Newman itself. Part of this machine consisted of six sharp saw-blades, which would spin when the mechanism was turned on. At some point in the appellant\u2019s operation of the machine on the day in question one of his hands came into contact with the spinning blades, causing him to lose a portion of the small finger.\nIn support of the products liability claim, the Complaint alleged that the employer\u2019s design and construction of the \u201cnotching\u201d machine was defective because there was no cover or guard over the saw-blades to protect the hands of operators, and that such defect was the cause of the appellant\u2019s injury. With respect to the companion theory of liability, the Complaint alleged that Newman, despite its awareness of the danger posed by the machine, deliberately forbade its workers from using a certain \u201cfeeding\u201d device which would have greatly reduced the risk of hand injury. Another averment was that Newman also knew that the \u201cnotching\u201d machine did not comply with federal and state safety regulations, and, for that reason, directed the appellant to remove it on the eve of an OSHA inspection which took place about eleven days before the accident. It was again placed in full operation when the safety inspectors departed. According to the Complaint, Newman\u2019s course of conduct amounted to a deliberate and wanton disregard for the safety of its workers, and such was the cause of the appellant\u2019s injury.\nAs noted, the trial court\u2019s order granting Newman\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings was based on section 303(a) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a). That section provides as follows:\nThe liability of an employer under this act shall be exclusive and in place of any and all other liability to such employes, his legal representative, husband or wife, parents, dependents, next of kin or anyone otherwise entitled to damages in any action at law or otherwise on account of any injury or death as defined in section 301(c)(1) and (2) or occupational disease as defined in section 108. (Emphasis added.)\nSection 303(a) is a version of the historical quid pro quo that employers received in return for being subjected to a statutory, no-fault system of compensation for worker injuries. Pursuant to its terms, an employer is given immunity from lawsuits by employees for any \u201cinjury\u201d defined as such by section 301(c) of the Act, 77 P.S. \u00a7 411. In Kline v. Arden H. Verner Co., 503 Pa. 251, 469 A.2d 158 (1983), this Court upheld section 303(a) against a challenge of unconstitutionality, and, in so doing, observed that the Act \u201cprovides the exclusive means by which a covered employee can recover against an employer for injury in the course of his employment.\u201d Id., 503 Pa. at 253, 469 A.2d at 159. We further stated that, because of the provision, a tort action by an employee against his employer for \u201cany work-related injury\u201d was barred. Id., 503 Pa. at 256, 469 A.2d at 160 (emphasis in original).\nDespite the language of section 303(a) and our statements in Kline, the appellant contends that Newman in the instant case should not be permitted to assert the statutory immunity from common law actions for employee injury. In so arguing, the appellant does not rely on any concept of \u201cdual capacity\u201d. See, e.g., Budzichowski v. Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania, 503 Pa. 160, 469 A.2d 111 (1983). And, although his Complaint sought to set forth a claim of products liability, he does not rely on that as a basis for piercing the shield of immunity. The appellant instead asserts that Newman\u2019s willful and wanton disregard for employee safety was the legal equivalent of an intentional tort, and as such, should preclude Newman from raising the section 303(a) immunity. He also contends that Newman\u2019s act of deliberately concealing the defective machine from OSHA inspectors should disqualify it from having the protection of that provision.\nThere is no Pennsylvania judicial authority supportive of the result the appellant seeks. The argument he presents is one based entirely on his view of the relationship between the Act and other laws and regulations which bear upon safety in the workplace. According to the appellant, if an employer is to be allowed to escape common law liability for intentional misconduct causing harm to a worker, governmental policies aimed at promoting job safety will be undermined. Analogous theories have been propounded by various writers on the subject of workmen\u2019s compensation. Some of these commentators take the position that the present statutory system of compensation, in not providing the injured worker with all that he might recover in a tort action, relieves the employer from bearing the full cost of maintaining an unsafe plant. According to these theorists, such a result should not be countenanced where an employee\u2019s injury has resulted from the employer\u2019s intentional creation of an injury-causing hazard. See generally, Note, Exceptions to the Exclusive Remedy Requirements of Workers\u2019 Compensation Statutes, 96 Harv. 1641, 1648 (1983).\nIt is true that the appellate courts of some other states have held that wanton and willful misconduct by an employer is tantamount to an intentional tort, and as such, prevents the operation of a statutory exclusive-remedy provision. See, e.g., Mandolidis v. Elkins Industries, Inc., 161 W.Va. 695, 246 S.E.2d 907 (1978). It must be noted, however, that those cases rested on provisions in the state workmen\u2019s compensation statutes which expressly preserved the right of an employee to sue in tort where his injury was caused by the employer\u2019s intentional wrongdoing. There is no such provision in The Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.\nThe appellant\u2019s argument is an interesting one; but it is one that must be resolved by the General Assembly, not this Court. What he is asking us to do is to engraft upon section 303(a) of the Act an exception the legislature did not see fit to put there. A reading of the Act will disclose that the legislature was not unmindful of the issue of intentionally caused harm. For example, in section 301(c)(1), 77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1), it is provided that \u201can injury caused by an act of a third person intended to injure the employe because of reasons personal to him ...\u201d does not fall within the statutory definition of a covered injury. (Emphasis added.) And, under section 205, 77 P.S. \u00a7 72, which immunizes an employee from tort actions for harm caused to a fellow employee, an exception is expressly made for the intentional infliction of harm. Since it is clear that the legislature had the issue of intentional harm in mind, and yet did not mention it in connection with section 303(a), we are constrained to conclude that the legislature did not intend the result for which the appellant argues.\nThus, the trial court was correct in holding that the appellant\u2019s lawsuit was barred by the Act, and properly entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the employer.\nFor the reasons set forth herein, the order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion in which PAPADAKOS, J., joins.\n. Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7 481(a).\n. The Reply concedes that the insurance carrier paid all applicable medical bills but alleges that only part of the wage loss was paid.\n. According to the Complaint, Newman is in the business of \"manufacturing, distributing and selling pallets and skids.\u201d There is no allegation that the employer manufactures \"notching\u201d machines for sale to others.\n. Under the \"dual capacity\" doctrine, \u201c 'an employer normally shielded from tort liability by the exclusive remedy principle may become liable in tort, to his own employee if he occupies, in addition to his capacity as employer, a second capacity that confers upon him obligations independent of those imposed upon him as employer.\u2019\" Budzichowski, supra, 503 Pa. at 167, 469 A.2d at 114 (quoting from 2A LARSON, WORKMEN\u2019S COMPENSATION LAW, \u00a7 72.80).
