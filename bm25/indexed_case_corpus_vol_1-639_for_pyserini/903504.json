{"id": "903504", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe facts set out in the defendant\u2019s petition to have the judgment opened were clearly sufficient to justify the court in making the rule absolute. There was corroborative testimony given which supported the allegations contained in the petition. As a matter of course the mere order to open did not assume to make any disposition of the costs or attorney\u2019s commission, and that subject is left entirely open for future determination.\nOrder affirmed."}
