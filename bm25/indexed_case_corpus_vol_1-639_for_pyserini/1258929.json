{"id": "1258929", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearne,\n\u25a0 \u25a0 The sole issue raised by this appeal is whether-or not- the signatures- of -the - settlor on the purported Amendment to an inter vivos deed of trust were for: geries. The learned Chancellor who heard the testimony found that the signatures were genuine. He dismissed the complaint in equity which sought to set aside the document.\nOn January 13, 1945, Amedeo Obici erected two inter vivos trusts, one known as the \u201cFriends and Relatives Trust\u201d and the other named the \u201cCharitable Trust\u201d. The Third National Bank of Scranton, Pa., was the corporate trustee in both trusts. The individual co-trustees are Frank A. English, Ralph J. Lisman, Joseph Rocereto and C. H. Murden who are successors to Mario Peruzzi, the originally named co-trustee, after his death. The trustees are named as defendants. A brother, Frank A. Obici, and his children are the plaintiffs.\nUnder the terms of the \u201cFriends and Relatives Trust\u201d 1785 shares of the corporate stock of the Planters Nut & Chocolate Company were placed in trust. The settlor, Amedeo Obici, was to receive the income therefrom for life and upon his decease such income was to be distributed as set forth in a schedule attached to the deed. Among the named beneficiaries were the plaintiffs, with their respective interests specified. On or about April 19, 1946, the settlor executed an Amendment to the trust together with other documents whereby 650 shares of the 1785 shares of the corporate stock trust res were transferred from the \u201cFriends and Relatives Trust\u201d to the \u201cCharitable Trust\u201d. The effect of such Amendment was to eliminate from the trust the named plaintiffs as beneficiaries upon the death of settlor. The settlor died May 21, 1947.\nThe Chancellor found that Alonzo M. McNiekle, described as a specialist'in estate planning, had been employed by settlor \u2022 to assist him ' and his counsel, Matthew D. Mackie, Esq.,.in planning'the distribution of settlor\u2019s vast estate. Mr. McNickle would receive instructions from settlor, whereupon Mr. McNickle would transmit the information to settlor\u2019s counsel, Mr. Mackie, who in turn would prepare the necessary papers for execution and transmit them to Mr. McNickle, who supervised their execution by settlor.\nThe Chancellor found that on or about April 15, 1948, Mr. McNickle was called to settlor\u2019s home at Suffolk, Virginia, by the settlor, and was requested by him to prepare changes in the \u201cFriends and Relatives Trust\u201d, removing plaintiffs as beneficiaries and transfer such shares to the \u201cCharitable Trust\u201d. Settlor also directed that his will be changed, bequeathing $1,000 to each of the plaintiffs. On April 18, 1946, Mr. McNickle went to Scranton to Mr. Maekie\u2019s office and had him prepare the papers. On April 19, Mr. McNickle took the documents to settlor at the home of Mario Peruzzi, in Wilkes-Barre, where settlor executed them in the presence of Mr. McNickle. No one signed as an attesting witness. According to Mr. McNickle\u2019s testimony, accepted as credible by the Chancellor, the will was dated April 20, 1946. The reason assigned by Mr. McNickle for the difference in dates of the questioned trust Amendment and the will was that April 19, 1948 was Good Friday and also because Mr. McNickle desired to have the changes in the trust agreement antedate the will \u201cso that there would be no legal question as to the incorporation by reference in the will of the terms of the existing trust\u201d.\nAppellants charge that settlor\u2019s name on the trust Amendment is forged. To overcome the force of Mr. McNickle\u2019s testimony that he saw settlor affix his- signature- to the paper, appellants- point to many matters which they regard as suspicious,-. Furthermore, they produced a handwriting -expert and - several lay witnesses who- testified- that,- in .'their- .opinions, the signatures of settlor were forged. Defendants also produced a handwriting expert and lay witnesses who testified that the signatures of settlor were genuine. The Chancellor found as a fact that settlor did execute the documents in his own handwriting. He accepted as credible the testimony of defendants\u2019 witnesses.\nAmedeo Obici\u2019s signature appears twice on the Amendment, once as settlor and again as individual trustee. Two officials of the corporate trustee also affixed their signatures along with that of Mr. Obici. The Obici signature again appears twice on the letter to the corporate trustee authorizing the transfer of the 650 shares of stock from the \u201cFriends and Relatives Trust\u201d to the \u201cCharitable Trust\u201d. One of these two signatures is likewise written in the capacity of individual trustee.\nThis Court has held that the credibility of witnesses is a matter resting with the finders of fact. In Garrett Estate, 372 Pa. 438, 447, 94 A. 2d 357, we said: \u201c. . Credibility of witnesses is always for the finders of fact: Nanty-Glo Boro. v. Amer. Surety Co., 309 Pa. 236, 163 A. 523. The disbelief of witnesses by a chancellor or . . . auditing judge which is approved by the court en banc, is conclusive on the appellate courts in the absence of proof of bias, prejudice, prejudgment, or capricious disbelief: Roberts Estate, 350 Pa. 467, 39 A. 2d 592; Osterling\u2019s Estate, 323 Pa. 23, 185 A. 790; Pusey\u2019s Estate, 321 Pa. 248, 184 A. 844\u2019; Archer Estate, 363 Pa. 534, 70 A. 2d 857.\u201d\n\u2022 Unlike the situation in Young Estate, 347 Pa. 457, 32 A. 2d 901, the Chancellor in the present ease believed the testimony of Mr. McNickle who testified that he \u2022saw settlor affix his signatures to the documents. This overcame any opinion evidence of expert and lay witnesses. In Pochron Will, 367 Pa. 306, 311, 80 A. 2d 794, we said: \u201cThe philosophy of the doctrine that opinion testimony alone will not overthrow testimony of actual fact is well expressed by Mr. Chief Justice Drew in Ray, to use, v. Philadelphia, 344 Pa. 439, 441, 442, 25 A. 2d 145: \u2018An opinion is only that; it creates no fact. It is what someone thinks about something, and the thought may be precisely accurate or totally inaccurate, and yet represent the absolutely honest conviction of the person who expresses it. Because of this, opinion evidence is generally considered of a low grade, and not entitled to much weight against positive testimony of actual facts. There is a great difference between factual and opinion testimony. In the one the witness testifies to the fact and certifies that what he says of it is true. In the other, he only testifies to his opinion that such a thing is true, and certifies only to his integrity of belief. He says he believes his opinion to be correct, but he does not warrant it to be true, and does not pretend that he cannot be mistaken.\u2019\n\u201cAs the opinion evidence of contestants, standing alone, does not overcome the factual and unimpeached testimony of the three attesting witnesses (also supported by opinion evidence), proof of the forgery of testatrix\u2019s signature to the questioned writing has not been established.\u201d\nIn accepting as credible defendants\u2019 evidence and rejecting that of plaintiffs\u2019, the learned Chancellor states: \u201cThe signature of Amedeo Obici purported to be made on the amendment to the \u2018Friends and Relatives Trust\u2019 of April 19, 1946, is challenged as a forgery. In order to find such a fact the Chancellor would have to hold (1) that McNickle is a liar; (2) that McNickle is a forger, or (3) that Mackie, Attorney, is a forger, . . .\n\u201cThe Chancellor can find no warrant in the evidence to make any such finding. To make such a finding -would be to assume the existence of the most fantastic, improbable and senseless plot imaginable. . . .\u201d\nThis Court has repeatedly held that suspicion and conjecture do not take the place of evidence: Rosenthal\u2019s Estate, 339 Pa. 488, 496, 15 A. 2d 370; William Sellers & Co., Inc. v. Clarke-Harrison, Inc., 354 Pa. 109, 46 A. 2d 497; Lasky v. Paprocki, 363 Pa. 50, 68 A. 2d 593; Pochron Will, 367 Pa. 306, 80 A. 2d 794.\nThe decree is affirmed. Costs to be paid by appellants."}
