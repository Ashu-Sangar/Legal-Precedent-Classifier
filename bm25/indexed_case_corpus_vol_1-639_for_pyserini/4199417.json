{"id": "4199417", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice EAKIN.\nAppellant was elected to a ten-year term as a Luzerne County Court of Common Pleas judge in 1991 and retained to an additional term in 2001. In 2006, the Judicial Conduct Board charged her with: failing to be courteous with others while she was acting in her official capacity; conduct bringing her judicial office into disrepute; failing to promptly dispose of the court\u2019s business; failing to conduct herself at all times in a manner promoting confidence in the judiciary; failing to disqualify herself in a proceeding in which her impartiality may be questioned; and conduct prejudicing the proper administration of justice. The Court of Judicial Discipline named a panel consisting of Conference Judge Sprague and Judges O\u2019Toole and Streib, to conduct the trial. At trial, the Board presented 30 witnesses, including Mark Ciavarella, then-President Judge of Luzerne County, Michael Conahan, ex-Luzerne County President Judge, William Sharkey, then-Luzerne County Court Administrator, and Jill Moran, then-Luzerne County Prothonotary.\nThe panel produced findings of fact and conclusions of law, to which appellant filed objections. The en banc court, after hearing argument regarding the panel\u2019s recommendations, found the Board proved all charges against appellant by clear and convincing evidence. Amongst these findings, the court found appellant failed to recuse herself in a case named State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. Bonner, when the Bonners had supported her politically. The court also found she engaged in judicial misconduct by instructing a law clerk to \u201ccut [a party\u2019s counsel] a new asshole.\u201d In Re Lokuta, 964 A.2d 988, 1104 (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc.2008) (Lokuta I). The court ordered her removal from judicial office and prohibited her from holding any future judicial office. Id., at 1134-36.\nJudge Streib, joined by Judge O\u2019Toole, filed a concurring and dissenting opinion. Judge Streib found Theodore Krohn, appellant\u2019s former law clerk, not credible; accordingly, she dissented on both issues to which Krohn testified. Id., at 1136 (Streib, J., concurring and dissenting). Further, she would have found appellant\u2019s remark to Krohn to \u201ccut [a party\u2019s counsel] a new asshole\u201d to be merely an off-hand remark not so egregious as to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct. Id., at 1136. Finally, Judge Streib argued the Board\u2019s allegation regarding Bonner was untimely raised. Id., at 1137.\nThree months after the Court of Judicial Discipline ordered appellant removed from office, the United States Attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania filed an information against Conahan and Ciavarella, and later indicted them. The information alleged Conahan and Ciavarella received money from Robert Powell, part owner of PA Child Care and Western PA Child Care juvenile detention facilities. Conahan and Ciavarella ensured the placement of juveniles with PA Child Care. We exercised our Kings\u2019 Bench jurisdiction to review Ciavarella\u2019s juvenile adjudications during the time in question, and ultimately expunged the records of those juveniles affected by Conahan\u2019s and Ciavarella\u2019s corruption. See In re Ex-pungement of Juvenile Records and Vacatur of Juvenile Court Consent Decrees or Adjudications from 2003-2008, 2009 Pa. LEXIS 2286, *10-*11 (Pa. October 29, 2009) (per curiam) (finding Ciavarella\u2019s financial connections with PA Child Care tainted his juvenile adjudications). We also ordered new proceedings in cases where Conahan and Ciavarella\u2019s corruption created a perception of impropriety. See Malinowski v. Nanticoke Micro Technologies, Inc., 2010 Pa. LEXIS 1372, at *5 (Pa. June 24, 2010) (per curiam) (remanding for new proceedings where Conahan and Ciavarella\u2019s conduct created appearance of impropriety); Joseph v. Scranton Times L.P., 604 Pa. 677, 987 A.2d 633, 635 (2009) (per curiam) (ordering new trial after Conahan assigned case involving his friend to Ciavarella).\nThe United States Attorney later indicted Sharkey for embezzling Luzerne County funds. Moran then entered into a Stipulation of Compromise, whereby she agreed to resign her post and cooperate with the United States Attorney in its investigation. Powell has since pled guilty to failing to report a felony and accessory to tax evasion. Conahan has entered an open guilty plea to one count of racketeering. This litany of appalling conduct has already been well-documented by our own special masters and the Interbranch Commission on Juvenile Justice. See, e.g., In re Expungement of Juvenile Records and Vacatur of Luzerne County Juvenile Court Consent Decrees or Adjudications from 2003-2008, at *8-*9; Interbranch Commission on Juvenile Justice, Report, at 9-19 (May 2010).\nIn response to these revelations, this Court remanded appellant\u2019s case to\n[t]he Court of Judicial Discipline for the limited purpose of that court considering [appellant]\u2019s claims in the nature of after discovered evidence, arising from the recent revelations of corruption in Luzerne County. The Court of Judicial Discipline is to determine whether the new evidence requires a further hearing and/or whether it affects the existing determination of the Court of Judicial Discipline to remove [appellant] from judicial office.\nIn re Lokuta, 600 Pa. 504, 968 A.2d 227, 227 (2009) (per curiam) (Lokuta II). We also stayed the Court of Judicial Discipline\u2019s order removing appellant from the bench and preventing her from holding judicial office pending remand, and stayed the election to fill her judicial seat. Id.\nOn remand, the court denied appellant relief and reaffirmed its decision to remove her from the bench. The court noted that for appellant to prevail on her after-discovered evidence claim, she must show her evidence is not used merely for impeachment, and the evidence must prove likely to change the outcome of her case. In re Lokuta, 989 A.2d 942, 948 (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc.2010) (Lokuta III) (citing Commonwealth v. Dennis, 552 Pa. 331, 715 A.2d 404, 415 (1998)). The court determined \u201cConahan\u2019s, Ciavarella\u2019s and Sharkey\u2019s criminal behavior could certainly be used to question their credibility; but that is all it could be used for.\u201d Id., at 950-51 (emphasis in original). Further, the court found this corruption was not likely to produce a different outcome, as the corruption was unrelated to appellant\u2019s behavior, and the other witnesses against her were credible.\nJudge Streib, joined by Judges Musmanno and O\u2019Toole, filed a dissenting statement. Judge Streib argued appellant should have been able to fully develop the extent of corruption in Luzerne County, and this Court did not intend for the Court of Judicial Discipline to conduct an after-discovered evidence analysis. Id., at 960 (Streib, J., dissenting). She noted while the court previously criticized appellant for her isolation from other Luzerne County judges, such isolation was now understandable. Id. Further, she would consider the corrupt environment to which appellant was exposed as a serious mitigating factor warranting a reduced sanction. Id.\nAppellant now raises the following claims on appeal, which we have reordered for ease of discussion: (1) whether Judge Sprague should have recused himself; (2) whether Judge Sprague and two other members of the court were ineligible to sit on appellant\u2019s proceeding; (3) whether the court construed our remand order too narrowly; (4) whether the court erred in considered evidence pertaining to Bonner; (5) whether the Board acted in bad faith in prolonging its investigation; (6) whether the court improperly admitted untimely evidence of misconduct; (7) whether the Board\u2019s deputy chief counsel\u2019s failure to appreciate the quasi-judicial nature of judiciary disciplinary proceedings denied her due process; (8) whether she was improperly denied access to exculpatory evidence; (9) whether the court improperly limited her cross-examination; (10) whether the Board failed to prove its case against her; (11) whether her on-bench conduct could not have brought the judiciary into disrepute; (12) whether the Board selectively prosecuted her; (13) whether the Board engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by overlooking Conahan and Ciaveralla\u2019s corruption; (14) whether various claims pertaining to material submitted under seal warrant relief; and (15) whether her sanction violated equal protection.\nA judicial officer has the right to appeal a final adverse order of the Court of Judicial Discipline to this Court. Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 18(c)(2). The Pennsylvania Constitution provides\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court ... shall review the record of the proceedings of the court as follows: on the law, the scope of review is plenary; on the facts, the scope of review is clearly erroneous; and, as to sanctions, the scope of review is whether the sanctions imposed were lawful. The Supreme Court ... may revise or reject an order of the court upon a determination that the order did not sustain this standard of review; otherwise, the Supreme Court ... shall affirm the order of the court.\nId. We now turn to appellant\u2019s claims.\nI. Judge Sprague\u2019s Recusal\nJudge Sprague, who was an attorney member of the Court of Judicial Discipline, served as Conference Judge. He decided the pre-trial motions, was one of the three court members who presided over appellant\u2019s trial, and authored the court\u2019s opinions in Lokuta I and Lokuta III. He also, through his private law practice, represented PA Child Care and Powell. Prior to trial, appellant moved to recuse Judge Sprague, because Moran was a member of Powell\u2019s law firm and two of appellant\u2019s potential witnesses had been in litigation against Powell or Judge Sprague. Judge Sprague denied this motion. In her post-verdict motion, appellant argued Judge Sprague should have recused himself, highlighting Moran\u2019s testimony, and claiming Judge Sprague relied upon Conahan and Ciavarella\u2019s testimony. The court dismissed appellant\u2019s post-verdict motions.\nOn remand, appellant again moved for Judge Sprague\u2019s recusal, contending the after-discovered evidence proved Conahan, Ciavarella, Moran, Sharkey, and Powell were corrupt. She further claimed Judge Sprague must have independently possessed knowledge of matters relevant to her case, and his duty as Conference Judge and Powell\u2019s counsel conflicted.\nJudge Sprague filed a memorandum denying appellant\u2019s recusal motion. Judge Sprague denied his representation of Powell involved any discussion of appellant or of the proceedings against her. Judge Sprague maintained \u201cno evidence was presented that in any way demonstrated any relationship between the federal investigation and the charges against [appellant].\u201d Court of Judicial Discipline Memorandum, 5/13/09, at 3 (Sprague, J.). He found he had no personal knowledge of the facts in the proceeding, and he had no personal bias concerning any party. Judge Sprague additionally observed appellant\u2019s claim that Conahan and Ciavarella orchestrated her ouster was belied by her testimony that she had cordial relations with Ciavarella. He further noted he did not bar damaging disclosures regarding them, noting there was no ruling regarding his clients. He also observed he did not sit alone, but his trial rulings were made together with Judges O\u2019Toole and Streib.\nAppellant contends Judge Sprague\u2019s representation of Powell and PA Child Care should have disqualified him from judging her case, because Powell was intimately involved in Conahan and Ciavarella\u2019s misconduct. She claims Judge Sprague made evidentiary rulings limiting the public disclosure of Powell and PA Child Care\u2019s involvement with Conahan and Ciavarella at her trial. Appellant notes Judge Sprague represented PA Child Care before Conahan in a case the United States Attorney later identified as being part of Conahan\u2019s corruption.\nThe Board argues judicial misconduct giving rise to an appearance of impropriety is not present here. The Board claims appellant never even attempted to present evidence about the corrupt relationships between Powell, PA Child Care, Conahan, and Ciavarella. It further alleges this corruption does not corroborate her claim that witnesses conspired to fabricate evidence against her. The Board also notes appellant never identified any exhibit or witness which would have been harmful to Powell, PA Child Care, Conahan, or Ciavarella. Thus, the Board contends appellant cannot show how Judge Sprague improperly precluded information harmful to Powell or PA Child Care.\nAn appellate court presumes judges are fair and competent, and reviews the denial of a recusal motion for an abuse of discretion. Commonwealth v. Whitmore, 590 Pa. 376, 912 A.2d 827, 834 (2006) (quoting Commonwealth v. Druce, 577 Pa. 581, 848 A.2d 104, 108 (2004)). Nonetheless, an \u201c \u2018appearance of impropriety is sufficient justification for the grant of new proceedings before another judge.... A jurist\u2019s impartiality is called into question whenever there are factors or circumstances that may reasonably question the jurist\u2019s impartiality in the matter.\u2019 \u201d Joseph, at 634 (quoting In Interest of McFall, 533 Pa. 24, 617 A.2d 707, 713 (1992)). \u201c \u2018There is no need to find actual prejudice, but rather, the appearance of prejudice is sufficient to warrant the grant of new proceedings.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting In Interest of McFall, at 714).\nAppellant does not show Judge Sprague abused his discretion in denying her recusal motions. Appellant does not establish which objections Judge Sprague improperly ruled on, or what evidence regarding Conahan and Ciavarella\u2019s corruption she would have introduced had it not been for Judge Sprague. Thus, appellant\u2019s appeal of Judge Sprague\u2019s denial of her recusal motions fails for lack of development. See Commonwealth v. Walter, 600 Pa. 392, 966 A.2d 560, 566 (2009) (failure to sufficiently discuss issues will cause them to be waived).\nNonetheless, certain factual circumstances can create an appearance of impropriety requiring a new proceeding before a new judge. In McFall, the sentencing judge agreed to serve as an agent for federal prosecutors after the prosecutors caught her accepting a bribe. This constituted an appearance of impropriety, as the judge was sentencing criminal defendants while seeking to curry favor with prosecutors. McFall, at 711-12. In Joseph, Joseph sued a newspaper for defamation after it implied he was associated with a reputed mobster. Conahan was associated with, and accepted unmarked envelopes from this mobster; the mobster said the outcome of the case would be favorable to Joseph. Conahan assigned the case to Ciavarella, who failed to reveal to the parties that he and Conahan were receiving payoffs from Powell. We concluded these circumstances created an appearance of impropriety. Joseph, at 635-36. In Malinowski, we ordered new proceedings in one of Ciavarella\u2019s cases where Conahan was a board member of one of the parties, and that party loaned money to an entity owned by Conahan\u2019s and Ciavarella\u2019s wives. Malinowski, at *5.\nSuch circumstances are not present here. Powell was not a participant or witness, nor was he otherwise related to, appellant\u2019s case. While Judge Sprague did have an attorney-client relationship with Powell, the parties knew about this relationship. Appellant does not establish Judge Sprague received illicit payments from anyone. Appellant provides no evidence Judge Sprague obtained evidence, or formed an opinion regarding her or her case, based on his relationship with PA Child Care or Powell, and appellant fails to show what evidence of Conahan\u2019s corrupt relationship with Powell she would have introduced. Additionally, Judge Sprague was just one of three judges presiding over appellant\u2019s trial and one of seven court members deciding her case, and appellant does not attempt to explain how Judge Sprague\u2019s private legal practice affected other court members. Accordingly, appellant fails to show Judge Sprague\u2019s relationship with Powell created an appearance of impropriety.\nII. Composition of the Court of Judicial Discipline\nAppellant challenges the composition of the Court of Judicial Discipline. She claims Judge Sprague was constitutionally ineligible to serve on the court because of his age. She notes the Pennsylvania Constitution requires mandatory retirement for the judiciary at the age of 70. See Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 16(b) (\u201cJustices, judges and justices of the peace shall be retired on the last day of the calendar year in which they attain the age of 70 years.\u201d). As the Court of Judicial Discipline was established as part of the Constitution\u2019s judiciary article, and because Pennsylvania has a unified judiciary, appellant argues this constitutional restriction should apply to the court. Because Judge Sprague exceeded the age of 70, she reasons he was ineligible to sit on the court. Appellant also claims Judges Musmanno and Bucci\u2019s service as Board members, during the early stages of its investigation of her, precluded them from judging her case on the Court of Judicial Discipline. See Lyness v. Commonwealth, State Board of Medicine, 529 Pa. 535, 605 A.2d 1204, 1209 (1992) (finding if administrative agency performs both prosecutorial and judicial functions, due process requires those functions be separated).\nThe Board claims appellant waived these arguments because she did not raise them until after her trial, when she included them in the final paragraph of her Objections to the Board\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. Further, as the Constitution refers to the composition of the court as \u201cmembers,\u201d the Board argues the retirement age for judges does not apply to the Court of Judicial Discipline. The Board also contends Judges Musmanno and Bucci were not disqualified from deciding appellant\u2019s case because neither of them participated in the Board\u2019s review of her case or its decision to file charges against her.\n\u201c[A] party seeking recusal or disqualification [is required] to raise the objection at the earliest possible moment, or that party will suffer the consequence of being time barred.\u201d Goodheart v. Casey, 523 Pa. 188, 565 A.2d 757, 763 (1989) (citing Reilly by Reilly v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, 507 Pa. 204, 489 A.2d 1291, 1298 (1985)). Appellant did not mention Judge Sprague\u2019s age in her pre-trial recusal motions, nor did she move to disqualify Judges Musmanno or Bucci before or during trial. She provides no reason for not raising either of these issues sooner. Because appellant failed to raise these issues at the earliest possible opportunity, they are waived.\nIII. Scope of the Remand Order\nOn remand, the Court of Judicial Discipline unanimously construed this Court\u2019s order, and its reference to recently revealed corruption, to be limited to the informations and indictments against Ciavarella, Conahan, and Sharkey, and Moran\u2019s Stipulation of Compromise. Lokuta III, at 949. The court determined there would be no discovery, but permitted appellant 90 days to investigate her claims and present additional evidence. Id,., at 946.\nAppellant argues the court improperly limited the scope of its review to the court filings. Appellant claims she should have been able to place her case in the context of this corruption, as explained by the reports of our special masters and the Interbranch Commission. Appellant contends such a context would allow her to prove Conahan and Ciavarella manipulated witnesses into testifying against her.\nThe Board contends it was reasonable for the court to construe \u201crecent revelations of corruption\u201d as limited to the corruption known at the time this Court issued its remand order. The Board observes the court allowed appellant to investigate, and she was unable to provide evidence showing witnesses conspired to bear false witness against her.\nThe issue of whether the Court of Judicial Discipline properly interpreted this Court\u2019s remand order is a matter of law; accordingly, our scope of review is plenary. See Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 18(c)(2) (scope of review for questions of law is plenary); In re Milton Hershey School, 590 Pa. 35, 911 A.2d 1258, 1261 (2006) (\u201cAs this is a purely legal question, our standard of review is de novo and scope of review is plenary.\u201d). We remanded appellant\u2019s case \u201cfor the limited purpose of that court considering [appellant\u2019s claims in the nature of after-discovered evidence, arising from the recent revelations of corruption in Luzerne County.\u201d Lokuta II, at 227. Appellant was able to offer evidence based on the corruption revealed shortly before our remand order. Nonetheless, she seeks to introduce evidence of Luzerne County corruption discovered after our remand order. However, our order did not refer to future, potential, or soon-to-be revealed allegations of corruption. Further, appellant does not indicate at which point future revelations of corruption would be irrelevant \u2014 she cannot seek a new trial with every new indictment or newspaper report? Such potentially unlimited reexamination of appellant\u2019s case would destroy the public interest of finality. See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 491, 111 S.Ct. 1454, 113 L.Ed.2d 517 (1991) (\u201cOne of the law\u2019s very objects is the finality of its judgments.\u201d). Further, allowing appellant to repeatedly reopen her case would frustrate Luzerne County\u2019s interest in filling the currently vacant judicial seat. Therefore, because our remand order explicitly referred to evidence arising from the then-recently revealed corruption, the Court of Judicial Discipline did not err in construing it to exclude evidence arising from later discovered allegations of corruption.\nIV. Bonner\nAt trial, Theodore Krohn, appellant\u2019s former law clerk, testified appellant presided over a bench trial in State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. v. Bonner, Luzerne County Docket No. 2147-C-2000. He testified he thought State Farm should prevail, but appellant indicated \u201cshe was going to decide in favor of the Bonners because they were a somewhat prominent Italian family in the Hazelton area who had supported [appellant] politically.\u201d Lokuta I, at 1112. As the Board had not mentioned this case in its complaint, appellant objected, claiming she had no notice of it. The court permitted the Board to amend its complaint to include Bonner, finding appellant had sufficient notice because the Board informed her about Bonner more than a year before. The court further reasoned even if the Board raised Bonner in its complaint, the outcome would have been no different. Id., at 1112-14.\nAppellant alleges the Board failed to set forth sufficiently particularized notice of the charges against her, denying her due process by depriving her of the opportunity to defend against the charges. Appellant highlights Bonner, where she was sanctioned despite not receiving notice in the complaint.\nThe Board contends the court acted within its proper discretion in allowing it to amend its complaint. The Board alleges it did not include Bonner in its complaint because Krohn could not properly identify the case, and it was only introduced when Krohn unexpectedly referred to it during direct examination. Nonetheless, the Board suggests appellant was given notice of the existence of this claim on three occasions more than a year before Krohn testified. Further, appellant had nearly two months from when Bonner was identified until Krohn completed his testimony. Thus, the Board argues she had ample notice of Bonner.\n\u201c[T]he Conference Judge may, in his or her discretion, permit substantive amendments to a Board Complaint with the written consent of the Judicial Officer or after a hearing on the motion in open court.\u201d Pa.C.J.D.R.P. 303(a). \u201cIt is well-settled ... the right to amend pleadings is within the sound discretion of the trial court and should be liberally granted.\u201d Ash v. Continental Insurance Co., 593 Pa. 523, 932 A.2d 877, 879 (2007). Appellant was informed of Krohn\u2019s allegations more than a year before he testified. Although the case\u2019s name was not revealed until trial, appellant still had more than a month to prepare a response. Further, appellant does not further identify how she was prejudiced by the court\u2019s decision to allow the Board to amend its complaint. She does not indicate she was unable to complete any necessary investigation or procure witnesses. Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the Board to amend its complaint and introduce evidence regarding Bonner. Like.wise, as appellant does not show how she was prejudiced by the admission of Bonner, she cannot prove her due process rights were violated. See Commonwealth v. Brado, 470 Pa. 306, 368 A.2d 643, 645 (1977) (\u201cUnder most circumstances, a claim of due process violation requires a showing of identifiable prejudice----\u201d). Accordingly, this claim fails.\nY. Duration of the Board\u2019s Investigation\nThe Board received the initial complaint against appellant on April 27, 2004, and filed charges on November 27, 2006. Pursuant to then-existent Judicial Conduct Board Rule of Procedure 31, the Board had 180 days to dismiss the complaint, file charges against appellant, or grant a continuance. The Board granted all necessary continuances prior to filing charges against appellant. Appellant claimed the duration of the Board\u2019s investigation violated Rule 31. The court acknowledged it had previously dismissed a complaint when the Board failed to exercise diligence. Lokuta I, at 1126 (quoting In re DeLeon, 902 A.2d 1027, 1031 (Pa.Ct.Jud.Disc.2006)). The court observed the delay in DeLeon was without explanation, as the Board conducted only one interview over the course of a year and a half, and the Board admitted it violated Rule 31. The court distinguished DeLeon, noting the Board spent six months obtaining appellant\u2019s mental health evaluation, and appellant caused further delay by opposing the Board\u2019s deposition of her. Therefore, the court concluded the Board conducted the investigation with diligence. Lokuta I, at 1127.\nAppellant, admitting the Board facially complied with Rule 31, contends the Board lacked good faith in granting the continuances. She argues the Board front-loaded its investigation, conducting most of it before issuing the Notice of Full Investigation, and delayed filing charges to circumvent Rule 31\u2019s spirit.\nThe Board insists it diligently investigated appellant. The Board argues its continuances were appropriate, as it was still investigating and waiting on appellant\u2019s mental health examination. The Board distinguishes DeLeon, noting there it violated Rule 31, and without explanation, did nothing for 18 months. The Board alleges it properly investigated here before issuing a Notice of Full Investigation, as it may \u201c \u2018conduct interviews and examine evidence to determine whether grounds exist to believe\u2019 \u201d a judicial officer engaged in misconduct. Board\u2019s Brief, at 39 (quoting Pa. Jud. Conduct Bd. R.P. 26(A)).\nThe Court of Judicial Discipline found \u201c[t]he facts establish that the Board conducted this investigation with diligence.\u201d Lokuta I, at 1127. As this is a factual finding, we may only reverse if it is clearly erroneous. See In re Hasay, 546 Pa. 481, 686 A.2d 809, 812 (1996) (citing Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 18(c)(2)) (\u201cIn an appeal by a judicial officer from an order imposing discipline, the standard of review for factual questions is the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d). The Board interviewed and deposed witnesses until November, 2005. The Board then spent six months obtaining a mental health examination of appellant, after which appellant spent three months resisting the Board\u2019s subpoena to depose her. Appellant offers no evidence, beyond her own speculation, that the Board acted without diligence or in bad faith. Therefore, we cannot hold the Board\u2019s finding was clearly erroneous. Accordingly, this claim must fail.\nYI. Timeliness of the Board\u2019s Allegations\nTestimony at trial referenced events occurring in the 1990s; appellant objected, claiming such testimony was time-barred. The court observed there are no statutory time-bars on judicial disciplinary proceedings, but Board Rule 15 limits the evidence the Board may present. Lokuta I, at 1127. However, the court found the Board may consider otherwise untimely evidence if it is part of a pattern of misconduct, and the last episode of misconduct occurred no earlier than four years before the Board received the initiating complaint. Id., at 1128. The court noted most of the evidence against appellant occurred within the four years prior to the filing of the initiating complaint, and evidence pre-dating that time was part of the same pattern of recurring judicial misconduct. Thus, conduct occurring more than four years before the Board received the complaint was admissible because the Board established a pattern of recurring judicial misconduct. Id., at 1128-29.\nAppellant argues Rule 15 only permits timely allegations of current misconduct to facilitate the inclusion of similar prior misconduct. She contends pattern evidence was used improperly here to prove \u201ccurrent misconduct in conformity with unproven allegations of prior misconduct.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 44. Appellant also claims the Board improperly included allegations against her from previously dismissed complaints. See Pa. Jud. Conduct Bd. R.P. 16(A) (rescinded 2007) (\u201cIf the Board dismisses a complaint ... the allegations in the complaint shall not be used against the Judicial Officer for any purpose in any other judicial disciplinary ... proceeding.\u201d).\nThe Board admits there was a prior complaint and claims appellant knew its contents. However, the Board contends appellant waived her argument by failing to offer any evidence regarding the prior complaint\u2019s contents, not objecting when a witness mentioned the prior complaint, and not raising the claim in her Objections to the Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law.\nAppellant baldly claims pattern evidence was improperly used to prove she acted in conformity with her alleged prior misconduct. However, she does not reference any specific evidence or cite any instance of record where the Board used pattern evidence to show she acted in conformity with prior misconduct. Therefore, appellant\u2019s Rule 15 claim fails for lack of development. See Walter, at 566.\nWe also find appellant\u2019s argument that the Board improperly included evidence from previously dismissed complaints to be waived. Appellant, despite filing lengthy and detailed Objections to the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, did not claim the Board included allegations from a previously dismissed complaint, nor does she identify where she previously raised this claim. Accordingly, this claim was not preserved before the Court of Judicial Discipline, and cannot be raised now. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a).\nVII. Due process in discovery\nTestifying before the Interbranch Commission, the Board\u2019s deputy chief counsel identified judicial disciplinary proceedings as \u201c \u2018not a criminal proceeding against a judge. It\u2019s really a civil administrative disciplinary proceeding with what has been identified as quasi-criminal overtones.\u2019 \u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief, at 33 (quoting N.T. Interbranch Commission Proceedings, 2/2/10, at 121). Appellant argues because the deputy chief counsel, who oversaw the Board\u2019s responses to her discovery requests, did not understand judicial disciplinary proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature, she was denied due process. The Board contends appellant fails to raise any appellate issue, as the Court of Judicial Discipline\u2019s rules, and not counsel\u2019s perceptions, governed discovery.\n\u201cJudicial conduct proceedings have been held to be quasi-criminal in nature; thus, the defendant is granted constitutional rights afforded to criminal defendants.\u201d In re Berkhimer, 593 Pa. 366, 930 A.2d 1255, 1258 (2007) (citing In re Chiovero, 524 Pa. 181, 570 A.2d 57, 61 (1990)). However, appellant fails to specify how her constitutional rights were violated because counsel stated \u201covertones\u201d instead of \u201cnature.\u201d She does not identify any discovery violation or other violation of her rights resulting from this statement. Accordingly, this claim fails for lack of development. See Walter, at 566.\nVIII. Brady claims\nAppellant, raising a Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), claim, argues the Board improperly withheld exculpatory material. She claims such exculpatory material includes witness statements, prior complaints, current and prior complaints against Conahan and Ciavarella, court records, audio recordings, and transcripts of court proceedings. Appellant argues the court should have allowed her to subpoena documents from witnesses and the Board\u2019s investigator. Appellant also contends the Board should have disclosed the Anonymous Complaint.\nThe Board claims the materials appellant sought were neither exculpatory nor relevant to her case. Regarding the Anonymous Complaint, the Board argues a confidential letter filed against another judge, containing nothing exculpatory, need not have been disclosed to her.\n\u201c[T]he suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.\u201d Brady, at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. The prosecution\u2019s duty to disclose evidence, pursuant to Brady, may include material impeachment evidence in addition to material exculpatory evidence. Commonwealth v. Bond, 604 Pa. 1, 985 A.2d 810, 821 (2009) (citing Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 884 A.2d 848, 854 (2005)). Evidence is material, and relief required, only \u201cif there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d Id. (citing Lambert, at 854). \u201cThe mere possibility that an item of undisclosed information might have helped the defense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial, does not establish materiality in the constitutional sense.\u201d Id., at 822 (quoting Commonwealth v. Chambers, 570 Pa. 3, 807 A.2d 872, 887 (2002) (citation omitted)). Similarly, to obtain relief for discovery violations, appellant must show the discovery violation prejudiced her. See In re Cicchetti, 560 Pa. 183, 743 A.2d 431, 445 (2000) (finding no discovery violation when judicial officer did not explain how requested information would be significant or relevant).\nHere, appellant failed to prove she was prejudiced by the Board\u2019s purported discovery violations. She claims the Board withheld favorable witnesses\u2019 statements, but she does not provide details of the content of these statements. She further claims she was entitled to have the Board\u2019s investigator, as well as multiple witnesses, produce documents. However, aside from a general assertion that these documents would be favorable to her, she does not explain how they were material.\nThe Anonymous Complaint only mentioned appellant in passing, alleging Conahan reassigned a case from appellant to himself. The Anonymous Complaint also alleged appellant sometimes handled juvenile cases before Conahan assigned Ciavarella to Juvenile Court. Despite appellant\u2019s repeated claims that Conahan corralled witnesses into testifying against her, the Anonymous Complaint makes no mention of such orchestrations. The Anonymous Complaint contains no information exculpating her; thus, if the Anonymous Complaint is to be material pursuant to Brady, it must be material impeachment evidence. The Board presented 30 witnesses, all of whom the court found credible. Even assuming the Anonymous Complaint would have destroyed Conahan\u2019s, Ciavarella\u2019s, and Sharkey\u2019s credibility, appellant fails to explain how it would have impacted the credibility of the Board\u2019s other 27 witnesses. She does not explain how the testimony of Conahan and Sharkey was so critical to the case against her that without it she is entitled to a new trial. Because appellant fails to adequately explain how any of the Board\u2019s purported non-disclosures were material, her Brady claim must fail. Similarly, appellant\u2019s discovery claims fail because she cannot show she was prejudiced by the lack of discovery.\nIX. Cross-Examination\nAppellant argues the court improperly limited her cross-examination of multiple witnesses, including herself, to Conahan\u2019s purported corrupt influence over appellant\u2019s case, thus limiting her ability to explore a witness\u2019s bias or self-interest. Specifically, appellant contends the court limited her cross-examination of Conahan regarding his distribution of the Board\u2019s chief counsel\u2019s business cards, which she believes proves Conahan organized the case against her. Appellant further claims the court should not have found the Board\u2019s witnesses credible when she did not have the opportunity to adequately cross-examine them.\nThe Board reviews appellant\u2019s references to the record, and notes in some of those occasions, appellant\u2019s cross-examination was not limited by any objection or court ruling. On all other occasions, the Board argues appellant failed to preserve her objections to the court\u2019s limitations of her cross-examination. See Thompson v. Thompson, 968 A.2d 474, 477 (Pa.Super.2008) (finding waiver for failure to object to limitation or hurrying of cross-examination).\nIt is well settled the \u201ctrial court has the discretion \u2018to determine the scope and limits of cross-examination and that this Court cannot reverse those findings absent a clear abuse of discretion or an error of law.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Rivera, 603 Pa. 340, 983 A.2d 1211, 1230 (2009) (quoting Commonwealth v. Nolen, 535 Pa. 77, 634 A.2d 192, 195 (1993)). Appellant cites 22 instances of purported improper limitation of cross-examination. All but two of these instances are part of one long string cite to the testimony of multiple witnesses. In five of these 20 purported instances, appellant\u2019s cross-examination of the witness was unfettered. N.T. Trial, 9/25/07, at 359; id., at 524; id., at 526; id., at 527; N.T. Trial, 9/28/07, at 1472. In four additional occasions, appellant cites to direct examinations. N.T. Trial, 9/25/07, at 541; id., at 542; N.T. Trial, 1/14/08, at 2837-42; N.T. Trial, 1/16/08, at 3692-93. Appellant offers no explanation as to how these rulings made during direct examinations, or her unimpaired cross-examination, constitute an improper limitation of her cross-examination. Thus, appellant\u2019s claim with respect to these nine instances fails.\nOf the remaining 11 instances, appellant globally claims her questions were directed to show the witnesses\u2019 bias or interest by exposing Conahan\u2019s corruption. She does not address any instance individually, or explain how her questioning would have shown the witnesses\u2019 bias or otherwise aided her case. Accordingly, her claims with respect to these 11 instances fail for lack of development. See Walter, at 566.\nAppellant, however, did develop an argument regarding Conahan\u2019s cross-examination. Nonetheless, her first citation to Conahan\u2019s testimony refers to the Board\u2019s direct examination of Conahan. N.T. Trial, 1/16/08, at 3692-93. In the other citation, appellant asked Conahan, \u201cHow many people have you given [the Board\u2019s chief counsel\u2019s card] to?\u201d Id., at 3715. Conahan replied, \u201cConservatively, between 50 and a hundred. People came to me to complain. Now whether they did anything, I don\u2019t know.\u201d Id. The court sua sponte struck the last part of Conahan\u2019s answer as irrelevant to appellant\u2019s question. Appellant did not object to the court\u2019s striking part of Conahan\u2019s question. It is well settled, \u201c[wjhenever counsel objects to a question asked by opposing counsel, and the objection is sustained, an exception is granted automatically; a formal request for an exception is unnecessary.\u201d Foster v. McKeesport Hospital, 260 Pa.Super. 485, 394 A.2d 1031, 1032 (1978). However, \u201can objection to excluded testimony may be waived if counsel acquiesces in the exclusion without obtaining a ruling by the court.\u201d Id. (citing Commonwealth v. Frazier, 467 Pa. 505, 359 A.2d 390, 391-92 (1976) (Roberts, J., concurring)). As appellant failed to object to the court sua sponte striking part of Conahan\u2019s answer, or to otherwise ask the court to reconsider its decision, she acquiesced to the exclusion of this statement and waived any objection thereto. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s cross-examination claims fail.\nX. Sufficiency of the Evidence\nAppellant argues the Board failed to prove her misconduct by clear and convincing evidence. She contends Conahan, Ciavarella, Sharkey, and Moran were the anchor of the Board\u2019s case; now that they are discredited, there is insufficient evidence to support the Board\u2019s case. She suggests the testimony of other witnesses was not credible, as they were subject to Conahan and Ciavarella\u2019s influence.\nThe Board notes questions of credibility and conflicts in evidence are not for appellate courts to resolve. The Board contends appellant challenges the court\u2019s credibility determinations, and as the Board presented 30 witnesses who often corroborated each other, sufficient evidence supported the court\u2019s finding that the Board\u2019s witnesses were credible. The Board also claims the testimony of Conahan, Ciavarella, Sharkey, and Moran was not central to its case, and appellant failed to show any of its other witnesses were manipulated to testify against her.\nThe court found all of the Board\u2019s witnesses credible, Lokuta III, at 951; appellant now challenges this determination. This Court reviews the Court of Judicial Discipline\u2019s factual findings to ensure they are not clearly erroneous. Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 18(c)(2). We have stated:\nThe Judicial Conduct Board is responsible for investigating and bringing charges, and at trial, the board must prove the charges by clear and convincing evidence. In considering whether the evidence presented is clear and convincing, the court must find the witnesses to be credible, and the facts and details to be distinctly remembered. The witnesses\u2019 testimony must be sufficiently clear, direct, weighty, and convincing.\nIn re Berkhimer, at 1258 (citations omitted). \u201c \u2018[(Questions of credibility and conflicts in the evidence presented are for the trial court to resolve, not our appellate courts.\u2019 \u201d Commonwealth v. Myers, 554 Pa. 569, 722 A.2d 649, 651-52 (1998) (quoting Commonwealth, Department of Transportation, Bureau of Traffic Safety v. O\u2019Connell, 521 Pa. 242, 555 A.2d 873, 875 (1989)). \u201c\u2018As long as sufficient evidence exists in the record which is adequate to support the [credibility] finding ... we are precluded from overturning that finding.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting O\u2019Connell, at 875).\nHere, appellant cannot show the court\u2019s credibility findings are not supported by sufficient evidence. While four of the witnesses have now been exposed as criminals, appellant overstates their importance. Conahan was only called to refute claims appellant made during her testimony. Ciavarella\u2019s testimony mainly concerned her chambers and assignments, and he was not even discussed by the court in Lokuta I. Moran\u2019s testimony was corroborated by another witness and a court transcript. As for the remaining 26 witnesses, all appellant offers is speculation that they were manipulated into testifying against her. Such speculation as to the coercion of multiple witnesses does not prove there is insufficient record evidence supporting the court\u2019s credibility determinations. Thus, appellant cannot overcome the deference owed to the Court of Judicial Discipline as the trial court and establish that court\u2019s credibility findings were clearly erroneous. Because appellant offers no other argument showing the Board failed to prove its case, her sufficiency claim cannot prevail.\nXI. Appellant\u2019s Conduct on the Bench\nThe Court of Judicial Discipline found appellant\u2019s on-bench conduct brought the judiciary into disrepute. Appellant claims her on-bench conduct could not have brought the judiciary into disrepute because it was Conahan and Ciavarella\u2019s misconduct, not her conduct, that brought the judiciary into disrepute. She further contends her on-bench conduct is speech protected by the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions and is entitled to immunity.\nThe Board argues appellant has waived this claim because she failed to raise any free speech argument before the court, and she does not cite to which specific conduct was protected speech. We agree. Appellant never argued to the Court of Judicial Discipline that her on-bench conduct was protected speech, Conahan and Ciavarella\u2019s horrific misconduct nullified her distinct misconduct, or her actions were protected by any immunity. Accordingly, these claims are waived. See Pa. R.A.P. 302(a).\nXII. Selective Prosecution\nAppellant argues the Board selectively prosecuted her, claiming the Board did not pursue other misbehaving jurists, including Conahan and Ciavarella, as vigorously as it prosecuted her. The Board contends appellant cannot prove selective prosecution, as she does not show it singled her out for any invidious reason, nor does she show she was similarly situated to any other jurist.\nTo prove selective prosecution, appellant must show \u201cfirst, others similarly situated were not prosecuted for similar conduct, and, second, the Commonwealth\u2019s discriminatory selection of them for prosecution was based on impermissible grounds such as race, religion, the exercise of some constitutional right, or any other such arbitrary classification.\u201d Commonwealth v. Mulholland, 549 Pa. 634, 702 A.2d 1027, 1034 (1997) (citing Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985)). Appellant fails to develop any argument as to how her prosecution was based on impermissible grounds. Therefore, this claim fails for lack of development. See Walter, at 566.\nXIII. Prosecutorial Misconduct\nAppellant argues Conahan facilitated the Board\u2019s case against her, as he handed out business cards of the Board\u2019s chief counsel. She claims the Board had a cordial working relationship with Conahan and shielded him from investigation because it was pursuing the case against her. Appellant contends the Board\u2019s shielding and use of Conahan, despite the Anonymous Complaint giving it notice of his misconduct, constitutes prosecutorial misconduct.\nThe Board claims appellant\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claim is unfounded, as Conahan had no control over the Board or its decisions, and he did not file the initial complaint. It contends the Anonymous Complaint did not reveal that Conahan committed perjury at appellant\u2019s trial. The Board further alleges appellant did not show how the absence of the Anonymous Complaint prejudiced her to the extent of precluding a just verdict.\nThis Court has explained:\nThe phrase \u201cprosecutorial misconduct\u201d has been so abused as to lose any particular meaning. The claim either sounds in a specific constitutional provision that the prosecutor allegedly violated or, more frequently, like most trial issues, it implicates the narrow review available under Fourteenth Amendment due process.... However, \u201c[t]he Due Process Clause is not a code of ethics for prosecutors; its concern is with the manner in which persons are deprived of their liberty.\u201d The touchstone is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor. If the defendant thinks the prosecutor has done something objectionable, he may object, the trial court rules, and the ruling \u2014 not the underlying conduct \u2014 is what is reviewed on appeal. Where, as here, no objection was raised, there is no claim of \u201cprosecutorial misconduct\u201d as such available.\nCommonwealth v. Tedford, 598 Pa. 639, 960 A.2d 1, 28-29 (2008) (citations omitted).\nAppellant again overstates Conahan\u2019s role in the case against her, as he was merely a rebuttal witness. As for appellant\u2019s perjury claims, she does not explain how the Anonymous Complaint proved Conahan perjured himself at her trial. However alarming the Anonymous Complaint\u2019s allegations were, they were just that \u2014 anonymous allegations \u2014 and by themselves were insufficient to prove perjury. Additionally, appellant does not show how the Board\u2019s failure, albeit inexplicable, to pursue another judge on the marginally related Anonymous Complaint denied her a fair trial when 30 credible witnesses testified against her. Appellant does not explain how Conahan\u2019s distribution of business cards violated her due process rights or prejudiced her. As appellant cannot prove she was denied a fair trial, her prosecutorial misconduct claim must fail.\nXIV. Sealed materials\nIn 2009, after Conahan and Ciavarella\u2019s corruption was exposed, a complaint was filed with the Board indicating Conahan wanted appellant removed from her judicial proceeding and took steps accordingly. After an investigation, the Board dismissed this complaint. The Court of Judicial Discipline ordered all filings related to this 2009 complaint be placed under seal. After a hearing, the court found these materials did not qualify as after-discovered evidence; thus, appellant was not entitled to relief. Further, during the course of remand, it was discovered the Board failed to turn over the report of a 2004 interview it conducted with the person who filed the initial complaint against appellant.\nAppellant argues the Board\u2019s investigation was inadequate and the court erred in not permitting her to use the 2009 complaint on remand. She claims the 2009 complaint supports her argument that Conahan exercised undue influence over Luzerne County courthouse personnel. Appellant argues she was prejudiced by the Board\u2019s failure to disclose evidence she claims shows Conahan orchestrated the charges against her. She also contends it engaged in prosecutorial misconduct by failing to correct Conahan\u2019s purported false testimony with the Anonymous Complaint and ignoring Conahan\u2019s misconduct while pursuing her.\nThe Board argues the complaint does not qualify as after-discovered evidence because it was cumulative of Conahan\u2019s known animus towards appellant. The Board further contends this complaint could only be used to attack the witnesses\u2019 credibility, and could not mitigate the overwhelming evidence of appellant\u2019s judicial misconduct. The Board, conceding it should have disclosed the 2004 interview report, maintains there was not a reasonable probability the case would have been different had it disclosed the report. The Board asserts appellant cannot show its failure to pursue Conahan\u2019s misconduct constituted prosecutorial misconduct depriving her of a fair trial.\nTo prevail on her after-discovered evidence claim, appellant must show \u201c(1) the evidence has been discovered after trial and it could not have been obtained at or prior to trial through reasonable diligence; (2) the evidence is not cumulative; (3) it is not being used solely to impeach credibility; and (4) it would likely compel a different verdict.\u201d Commonwealth v. Washington, 592 Pa. 698, 927 A.2d 586, 595-96 (2007) (citing Commonwealth v. D\u2019Amato, 579 Pa. 490, 856 A.2d 806, 823 (2004)). Here, appellant cannot prove the 2009 complaint satisfies the requirements for after-discovered evidence. Appellant may have used material from the 2009 complaint to question the credibility of two witnesses against her; however, after-discovered evidence must be used for more than impeachment. Evidence regarding Conahan\u2019s animus towards appellant is cumulative, as the discord between appellant and Conahan was well established at trial. Conahan\u2019s purported attempts to assure appellant\u2019s removal from office are irrelevant because appellant cannot show they occurred at a relevant time. Thus, appellant is not entitled to relief based on the 2009 complaint.\nAs for appellant\u2019s allegation regarding the Board\u2019s failure to disclose the 2004 interview report, the Board correctly notes appellant raises a Brady claim. To obtain relief on a Brady claim, the non-disclosed evidence must be material. Evidence is material only \u201cif there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d Bond, at 821 (citing Lambert, at 854). The interview report does not contain exculpatory information. Even if the report was used to impeach the complainant, it still would not have impeached the testimony of the 29 other witnesses. Because appellant cannot show there is a reasonable probability the outcome of her trial would have been different had this interview report been disclosed, she cannot prove her entitlement to relief.\nAppellant\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct claims are likewise unpersuasive. In addressing prosecutorial misconduct claims, \u201c[t]he touchstone is the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d Tedford, at 28 (citing Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982)). We have already rejected appellant\u2019s Brady claim based on the Anonymous Complaint, as appellant failed to show it was material to her case. The Anonymous Complaint mentions appellant only in passing, does not refer to any conspiracy or plot against her, and would not have impeached 27 credible witnesses who testified against her; thus, it would not have undermined the fairness of appellant\u2019s trial. Accordingly, appellant cannot prove she was denied a fair trial because of the Board\u2019s failure to disclose the Anonymous Complaint.\nAppellant next claims Conahan, with the Board\u2019s acquiescence, corralled witnesses to testify against her. While there is no doubt Conahan disliked appellant, even now that he and Ciavarella have been exposed, appellant cannot prove he persuaded -witnesses to testify against her. During trial, the court found the testimony of Conahan and other witnesses credible when they said they did not collude against her. Appellant offers only rank speculation to show the Board knew Conahan colluded against her. Such speculation is insufficient to prove she received an unfair trial.\nAs for appellant\u2019s selective prosecution claim, she must show \u201cfirst, others similarly situated were not prosecuted for similar conduct, and, second, the Commonwealth\u2019s discriminatory selection of them for prosecution was based on impermissible grounds such as race, religion, the exercise of some constitutional right, or any other such arbitrary classification.\u201d Mulholland, at 1034 (citing Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598, 105 S.Ct. 1524, 84 L.Ed.2d 547 (1985)). Appellant suggests Conahan was similarly situated to herself, and the Board did not prosecute him because it was selectively prosecuting her. She fails to show any arbitrary classification, such as race, religion, or the exercise of a constitutional right, motivated the Board to pursue her. Therefore, her selective prosecution claim fails. For the above reasons, appellant is not entitled to relief based on the sealed materials.\nXV. Sanction\nAppellant claims the court\u2019s sanction of removing her from the bench violated her equal protection rights. Appellant contends her sanction was harsher than that imposed on judges who engaged in more egregious misconduct.\nThe Board observes the court found appellant brought disrepute upon the judiciary, prejudiced the proper administration of justice, and violated the Code of Judicial Conduct. The Board contends appellant cites no case within the scope and breadth of her misconduct. After briefly summarizing appellant\u2019s misconduct, the Board notes appellant showed no remorse for her actions.\nIn reviewing the Court of Judicial Discipline\u2019s sanctions of a judicial officer, our review is limited to whether those sanctions were lawful. Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 18(c)(2); see also In re Berkhimer, at 1259 (\u201c[T]he purpose of our review is not to re-weigh the sanction against aggravating or mitigating circumstances, but to determine whether the sanction is lawful.\u201d). \u201cThe Pennsylvania Constitution, art. V, \u00a7 18, sets forth removal as an available sanction for bringing disrepute upon the judicial office.\u201d Id., at 1260. \u201cThe Court of Judicial Discipline is charged with protecting the integrity of the judiciary and upholding public confidence in the judicial branch.... \u201d Id., at 1259-60 (citing In re Melograne, 571 Pa. 490, 812 A.2d 1164, 1168 (2002)). \u201c \u2018In disciplining a judicial officer, that tribunal not only punishes the wrongdoer, but also repairs the damaged public trust and provides guidance to other members of the judiciary regarding their conduct.\u2019 \u201d Id., at 1259 (quoting In re Melograne, at 1168).\nThe Court of Judicial Discipline had lawful authority to impose removal from office as a sanction for appellant\u2019s misconduct. Further, appellant cannot prevail on her equal protection argument. She does not detail the sanction imposed on any other jurist, or explain how another jurist\u2019s conduct was more egregious than her own. Similarity of misconduct does not require identicality of sanction, for there are other factors that bear on that decision, including mitigating and aggravating considerations and how a particular jurist\u2019s misconduct undermines public confidence in the judiciary. In focusing only on her misconduct and nothing more, appellant ignores these other factors, including, for example, her lack of remorse at her misconduct. As she cannot show her equal protection rights were violated, she is not entitled to relief regarding her sanction.\nAccordingly, the Court of Judicial Discipline\u2019s opinions and sanction are affirmed. Appellant\u2019s Application for Oral Argument and Sealed Application for Oral Argument are denied as moot.\nJurisdiction relinquished.\nJustices TODD and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nJustice BAER files a concurring opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\n. The Court of Judicial Discipline consists of eight members, including three judges, one magisterial district judge, two attorneys, and two non-attorney electors. Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 18(b)(1). Upon the Board\u2019s filing of a complaint, the court must hold hearings and:\nThe subject of the charges shall be presumed innocent in any proceeding before the court, and the board shall have the burden of proving the charges by clear and convincing evidence.... A decision of the court may order removal from office, suspension, censure or other discipline as authorized by this section and as warranted by the record.\nId., \u00a7 18(b)(5).\n. A conference judge, appointed by the court's President Judge, presides over the pre-trial motions and conducts the pre-trial conference. Pa.C.J.D.R.P. 301 (B)-(C).\n. Although we refer to the members of the Court of Judicial Discipline as \"judges\u201d throughout this opinion, such titling should not be construed as expressing any opinion as to whether membership of that court constitutes being a judge within the meaning of Pa. Const, art. V, \u00a7 16(b) (\"Justices, judges and justices of the peace shall be retired on the last day of the calendar year in which they attain the age of 70 years.\u201d).\n. Judge Patrick Judge, Sr., now President Judge, recused himself in appellant's matter.\n. Judge Streib did not contest other matters determined by the court to be factual. The court found appellant was frequently absent and customarily showed up late for court. Lokuta I, at 1001. Appellant was \"impatient, undignified and discourteous to court personnel,\u201d id., at 1007, and created \"a tense and stressful atmosphere.... [Her] treatment of the deputy sheriffs ... was so rude and upsetting that the sheriff had to rotate them out ... every hour or hour and a half.\u201d Id., at 1008. Appellant created a tense atmosphere in her chambers that damaged her staff's ability to work. She isolated herself from, and was confrontational with, the rest of the courthouse. Id., at 1034. Appellant publicly complained about Luzerne County\u2019s president judges in open court. Id., at 1063. She falsely accused a deputy court administrator of assaulting her tipstaff. Id., at 1067-70. Appellant failed to follow personnel rules established by the president judges. She handled fewer cases than other judges, and disposed of cases slower than other judges. Id., at 1089. Appellant required a law clerk and a legal intern to provide personal services, including grocery shopping, yard work, and home maintenance. Id., at 1098.\nAccordingly, the court held appellant violated various canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, and brought the judicial office into disrepute and prejudiced the proper administration of justice, in violation of Article V, \u00a7 18(d)(1) of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Id., at 1134-35. We will not review these findings except to the extent appellant has properly developed a challenge thereto.\n. Conahan, in a motion to dismiss the indictment against him, alleged he, Ciavarella, and Powell entered into a joint defense agreement during appellant\u2019s trial. Appellant argues Judge Sprague was conflicted as he was representing Conahan at the same time he testified. To prove this, she asks us to take judicial notice of this factual averment in Conahan\u2019s motion to dismiss. If appellant has to refer to Conahan's motion to dismiss to prove the existence of this alleged joint defense agreement, it is not common knowledge; further, Conahan's factual averments cannot be considered a \"source[ ] whose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned.\u201d Pa.R.E. 201(b). Accordingly, we decline to take judicial notice of this allegation, and this claim fails.\n. Appellant argues Judge Sprague\u2019s bias is evidenced by his order to disclose the names of federal investigators she talked to. The record shows the court\u2019s pre-trial order required the parties to disclose the \"names and addresses of all witnesses expected to testify at trial.\u201d Court of Judicial Discipline Order, 4/17/07, at 1. In her witness list, appellant listed unnamed and unspecified federal investigators. Respondent\u2019s Revised Witness List, 7/6/07, at 21. The Board sought to compel appellant to disclose the names and addresses of the federal investigators. Motion to Compel and for Sanctions, 8/10/07, at 3-5. The court ordered appellant to provide these names and addresses. Court of Judicial Discipline Order, 8/28/07, at 1. Appellant sought reconsideration en banc, Motion for Reconsideration, 9/5/07, at 1-2, which was denied. Court of Judicial Discipline Order, 9/10/07, at 1. She then amended her witness list to remove any reference to federal investigators. Amendment to Respondent's Revised Witness List, 9/14/07, at 1. Thus, appellant sought to circumvent the order. Appellant fails to show how Judge Sprague\u2019s relationship with Powell influenced his enforcement of the pre-trial order. Accordingly, appellant fails to show how this ruling creates an appearance of impropriety.\n. Appellant also suggests the court improperly admitted Bonner as pattern evidence. However, she did not object to the admission, nor did she raise the claim before the court in her Objections to the Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law. Accordingly, this argument is waived. See Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) (\"Issues not raised in the lower court are waived and cannot be raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d). Although Pa.R.A.P. 302(a) is not in the Rules for Appeals from the Court of Judicial Discipline, the issue-preservation requirement embodied therein applies to judicial disciplinary proceedings. See, e.g., In re Lokuta, 2009 Pa. LEXIS 2566, * 1 (Pa. November 24, 2009) (per curiam ) (\"Once a final order is entered [on remand appellant] may, if she opts to file an appeal, raise preserved claims of error.\u201d); In re Melograne, 571 Pa. 490, 812 A.2d 1164, 1167 (2002) (finding challenge to court\u2019s authority was waived).\n. While Ash was a civil case, appellant advances no argument why this well-settled standard should not apply in judicial disciplinary proceedings.\n. Rule 31 provided:\n(A) Except as provided in paragraph (C), within 180 days of the Board\u2019s receipt of the Judicial Officer's written response pursuant to Rule 30(B)(2)(c) or written response to any subsequent letter requesting information by the Board, the Board shall:\n(1) dismiss the complaint upon a finding that there is no existing probable cause to file formal charges;\n(2) dismiss the complaint with the issuance of a letter of counsel upon a determination that, even if the alleged conduct occurred, it was not conduct which requires that formal charges be filed, provided that the Judicial Officer:\n(a) consents in writing;\n(b) stipulates that the letter of counsel may be used during proceedings involving new complaints against the Judicial Officer; and\n(c) agrees to and satisfies any conditions required by the Board; or\n(3) authorize the filing of formal charges with the Court of Judicial Discipline.\n(B) If the Board dismisses a complaint following a full investigation, Chief Counsel shall promptly notify the Judicial Officer and the complainant.\n(C) Exceptions.\n(1) The Board may continue a full investigation of a matter beyond the 180-day period set forth in paragraph (A) upon a good faith belief that further investigation is necessary.\n(2) The Board may defer disposition of a complaint pursuant to paragraph (A) upon discovery or receipt of additional, corollary, or cognate allegations which may necessitate an investigation.\n(3) The receipt of the Judicial Officer's written response to any Rule 30(B) notice or supplemental or investigatory letter is a necessary prerequisite to the tolling and calculation of the 180-day period set forth in paragraph (A). Thus, the 180-day time period is wholly inapplicable if the Judicial Officer fails to file a written response and the investigation will continue to conclusion.\nPa. Jud. Conduct Bd. R.P. 31 (rescinded 2007).\n. Appellant claims two of her potential witnesses died before trial, and a third was suffering dementia. Appellant never claims the loss of these witness prejudiced her. One of these witnesses died in 1999, five years before the Board received the initiating complaint. Appellant does not explain how the testimony of the other two witnesses would have been relevant or helpful to her case. Thus, this argument fails for lack of development. See Walter, at 566.\n. DeLeon offers appellant no refuge, as in DeLeon there was no question the Board violated Rule 31. Here, appellant admits the Board complied with Rule 31, and cannot prove the Board acted without diligence.\n. Rule 15 provides:\nExcept where the Board determines otherwise for good cause, the Board should not consider complaints arising from acts or omissions occurring more than four years prior to the date of the complaint, provided, however, that when the last episode of an alleged pattern of recurring judicial misconduct arises within the four-year period, the Board may consider all prior acts or omissions related to such an alleged pattern of conduct.\nPa. Jud. Conduct Bd. R.P. 15.\n. The Anonymous Complaint refers to an unsigned eight-page complaint, received by the Board on September 28, 2006, alleging Conahan, with Ciavarella\u2019s aid, engaged in multiple acts of misconduct. The Anonymous Complaint alleged Conahan used his power to help his friends, presided over matters presented by attorneys who were his close personal friends and business acquaintances, and often ordered Powell\u2019s cases be assigned to Ciavarella. The Anonymous Complaint was not disclosed until the Board included it as an exhibit during remand proceedings in this matter.\n. The Board contends appellant\u2019s discovery claims are waived because she failed to raise them at trial and in her Objections to the Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. However, as appellant raised her discovery claims pre-trial, and there is no proof she knew about the Anonymous Complaint during trial, we address the merits.\n. Because the Board tabled action on the Anonymous Complaint due to the pendency of her trial, appellant argues her case should be dismissed and the Board\u2019s counsel and deputy counsel should be sanctioned. As the prosecutor\u2019s intentions are irrelevant to Brady claims, this allegation is irrelevant to appellant\u2019s Brady claim. See Bond, at 821 (Brady disclosure required regardless of good or bad faith of prosecutor).\n. Appellant actually offers 26 citations, but four are redundant as they cite to a different part of a ruling already cited.\n. Appellant also contends the court improperly refused to admit documentary evidence purportedly contradicting witness testimony. However, appellant fails to explain how this evidence was improperly excluded, or how this documentary evidence contradicts witness testimony. Thus, this claim fails for lack of development. See Walter, at 566.\n. Appellant\u2019s argument focuses on the credibility of the Board's witnesses. Except for her challenge regarding her on-bench conduct, discussed infra, appellant has waived any other basis for challenging the sufficiency of the Board\u2019s case.\n. Appellant raised her prosecutorial misconduct claim before the court during remand proceedings, and thus preserved this claim for appellate review.\n. See N.T. Sanction Hearing, 12/9/08, at 103."}
