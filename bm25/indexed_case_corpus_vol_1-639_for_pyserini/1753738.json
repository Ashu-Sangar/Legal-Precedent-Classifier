{"id": "1753738", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nNIX, Justice.\nAppellants, Cedarbrook Realty, Inc. and John W. Merriam and Thomas Wynne, Inc., t/a Cedarbrook Joint Venture (hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cCedarbrook\u201d or \u201ctaxpayer\u201d), timely received its real estate billings from Appellees, School District of Cheltenham Township, Montgomery County, Cheltenham Township, and Montgomery County Institution District in 1977. The aggregate asserted tax liability of Cedarbrook to these taxing entities was approximately one million, eight hundred thousand dollars ($1,800,000.00). Cedarbrook failed and refused to pay any sums on account of its tax liabilities to any of the taxing districts. In an effort to collect the substantial tax revenues owed by Cedarbrook for 1977, the taxing districts informed Cedarbrook prior to October 7, 1977, that they would order Charles F. Nahill, Jr., the tax collector of Cheltenham Township to begin sequestration of Cedarbrook\u2019s rents if Cedar-brook\u2019s taxes became delinquent and remained unpaid on November 1,1977 pursuant to the statutory authority vested in that official by Section 19 of the Local Tax Collection Law of 1945, Act of May 25, P.L. 1050 \u00a7 19, 72 P.S. 5511.19 . On October 7, 1977, Cedarbrook began an action in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County seeking to restrain the taxing districts from availing themselves, of the statutorily granted rent sequestration remedy. The requested injunctive relief was denied by the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County and that ruling was sustained on an appeal to the Commonwealth Court. Cedar- brook Realty, Inc., et al. v. Nahill et al, 35 Pa.Cmwlth. 352, 387 A.2d 127 (1978). Because of the importance of the questions raised in this action, this Court granted Cedar-brook\u2019s Petition for Allowance of Appeal, but denied its request for a continuation of the Stay pending the disposition of this Appeal. For the reasons that follow, we now affirm the Order of the Commonwealth Court.\nCedarbrook asserts that the Chancellor was incorrect in denying the requested injunctive relief arguing that Section 19 is unconstitutional in that it deprives the taxpayer of procedural due process by not providing for a hearing prior to (or after) seizure of the taxpayer\u2019s property and in the alternative that Section 19 was impliedly repealed by the provisions of the Real Estate Tax Sale Law of 1947. Act of July 7, 1947, P.L. 1368, No. 542, art. I, \u00a7 101, et seq.; 72 P.S. 5860.101, et seq.\nNormally, equity has no jurisdiction to restrain the collection of taxes and the parties should be made to seek the statutorily prescribed remedies. Rochester and Pittsburgh Coal Co. v. Indiana County Board of Assessment and Revision of Taxes, 438 Pa. 506, 266 A.2d 78 (1970). Where there is a challenge that the statutory remedy does not meet the mandate of due process, as is the case here, the claim is in essence an assertion of the inadequacy of the statutorily prescribed remedy and equitable intervention for the consideration of such a complaint is obviously appropriate. Thus, the Chancellor properly entertained the challenge and it would have been appropriate to have given relief if the taxpayer had sustained the due process complaint. We must now consider the Chancellor\u2019s determination that Cedar-brook failed to justify the issuance of a preliminary injunction.\nWhen an individual is deprived of property by governmental action, he must be afforded at some point in the proceeding an opportunity to be heard. The point at which this hearing must take place, however, varies with the circumstances. Earlier decisions of the United States Supreme Court clearly approved of tax collection procedures that only provided an opportunity for a hearing through a subsequent suit for redress. In Phillips v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 283 U.S. 589, 51 S.Ct. 608, 75 L.Ed. 1289 (1931), Mr. Justice Brandeis, writing for the Court, noted that the right of the government to collect its internal revenue by summary administrative proceedings \u201chas long been settled\u201d. Id. at 595, 51 S.Ct. 608.\nWhere, as here, adequate opportunity is afforded for a later judicial determination of the legal rights, summary proceedings to secure prompt performance of pecuniary obligations to the government have been consistently sustained. Compare Cheatham v. United States, 92 U.S. 85, 88-89, 23 L.Ed. 561; Springer v. United States, 102 U.S. 586, 594, 26 L.Ed. 253; Hagar v. Reclamation District No. 108, 111 U.S. 701, 708-709, 4 S.Ct. 663, 28 L.Ed. 569. Property rights must yield provisionally to governmental need. Thus, while protection of life and liberty from administrative action alleged to be illegal may be obtained promptly by the writ of habeas corpus, United States v. Woo Jan, 245 U.S. 552, 38 S.Ct. 207, 62 L.Ed. 466; Ng Fung Ho v. White, 259 U.S. 276, 42 S.Ct. 492, 66 L.Ed. 938, the. statutory prohibition of any \u201csuit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax\u201d postpones redress for the alleged invasion of property rights if the exaction is made under color of their offices by revenue, officers charged with the general authority to assess and collect the revenue. Snyder v. Marks, 109 U.S. 189, 3 S.Ct. 157, 27 L.Ed. 901; Dodge v. Osborn, 240 U.S. 118, 36 S.Ct. 275, 60 L.Ed. 557; Graham v. du Pont, 262 U.S. 234, 43 S.Ct. 567, 67 L.Ed. 965. This prohibition of injunctive relief is applicable in the case of summary proceedings against a transferee. Act of May 29, 1928, c. 852, \u00a7 604, 45 Stat. 791, 873. Proceedings more summary in character than that provided in \u00a7 280, and involving less directly the obligation of the taxpayer, were sustained in Murray's Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 15 L.Ed. 372. It is urged that the decision in the Murray case was based upon the peculiar relationship of a collector of revenue to his government. The underlying principle in that case was not such relation, but the-need of the government promptly to secure its revenues. Id. at 595-96, 51 S.Ct. at 611 (Footnote omitted).\nIn Nickey v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 393, 396, 54 S.Ct. 743, 744, 78 L.Ed. 1323 (1934) the Court stated:\nThere is no constitutional command that notice of the assessment of a tax, and opportunity to contest it, must be given in advance of the assessment. It is enough that all available defenses may be presented to a competent tribunal before exaction of the tax and before the command of the state to pay it becomes final and irrevocable. Wells, Fargo & Co. v. Nevada, 248 U.S. 165, 39 S.Ct. 62, 63 L.Ed. 190; Bristol v. Washington County, 177 U.S. 133, 146, 20 S.Ct. 746, 44 L.Ed. 701; McMillen v. Anderson, 95 U.S. 37, 23 L.Ed. 335; see American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, 287 U.S. 156, 168, 53 S.Ct. 98, 77 L.Ed. 231. .\nThe classic rationale in tax collection cases was announced by Mr. Justice ROBERTS in Bull v. United States, 295 U.S. 247, 259-60, 55 S.Ct. 695, 699, 700, 79 L.Ed. 1421 (1935): A tax is an exaction by the sovereign, and necessarily the sovereign has an enforcible claim against every one within the taxable class for the amount lawfully due from him. The statute prescribes the rule of taxation. Some machinery must be provided for applying the rule to the facts in each taxpayer\u2019s case, in order to ascertain the amount due. The chosen instrumentality for the purpose is an administrative agency whose action is called an assessment. The assessment may be a valuation of property subject to taxation which valuation is to be multiplied by the statutory rate to ascertain the amount of tax. Or it may include the calculation and fix the amount of tax payable, and assessments of federal estate and income taxes are of this type. Once the tax is assessed the taxpayer will owe the sovereign the amount when the date fixed by law for payment arrives. Default in meeting the obligation calls for some procedure whereby payment can be enforced. The statute might remit the Government to an action at law wherein the taxpayer could offer such defense as he had. A judgment against him might be collected by the levy of an execution. But taxes are the life-blood of government, and their prompt and certain availability an imperious need. Time out of mind, therefore, the sovereign has resorted to more drastic means of collection. The assessment is given the force of a judgment, and if the amount assessed is not paid when due, administrative officials may seize the debtor\u2019s property to satisfy the debt.\nIn recognition of the fact that erroneous determinations and assessments will inevitably occur, the statutes, in a spirit of fairness, invariably afford the taxpayer an opportunity at some stage to have mistakes rectified. Often an administrative hearing is afforded before the assessment becomes final; or administrative machinery is provided whereby an erroneous collection may be refunded; in some instances both administrative relief and redress by an action against the sovereign in one of its courts are permitted methods of restitution of excessive or illegal exaction. Thus the usual procedure for the recovery of debts is reversed in the field of taxation. Payment precedes defense, and the burden of proof, normally on the claimant, is shifted to the taxpayer. The assessment supersedes the pleading, proof and judgment necessary in an action at law, and has the force of such a judgment. The ordinary defendant stands in judgment only after a hearing. The taxpayer often is afforded his hearing after judgment and after payment, and his only redress for unjust administrative action is the right to claim restitution. But these reversals of the normal process of collecting a claim cannot obscure the fact that after all what is being accomplished is the recovery of a just debt owed the sovereign.\n[Emphasis added].\nIn the more recent United States Supreme Court decisions concerning the procedural due process requirement where a deprivation of the property of the individual was involved, the Court has become more critical of procedures that provide only for redress through subsequent suits. Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976); North Ga. Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601, 95 S.Ct. 719, 42 L.Ed.2d 751 (1975); Mitchell v. W. T. Grant Co., 416 U.S. 600, 94 S.Ct. 1895, 40 L.Ed.2d 406 (1974); Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970); Sniadach v. Family Finance Corp., 395 U.S. 337, 89 S.Ct. 1820, 23 L.Ed.2d 349 (1969). This new view of the mandate of due process has at least, in part, resulted from the rejection of the position that property rights are entitled to less constitutional protection than personal rights.\nSuch difficulties indicate that the dichotomy between personal liberties and property rights is a false one. Property does not have rights. People have rights. The right to enjoy property without unlawful deprivation, no less than the right to speak or the right to travel, is in truth a \u2018personal\u2019 right, whether the \u2018property\u2019 in question be a welfare check, a home, or a savings account. In fact, a fundamental interdependence exists between the personal right to liberty and the personal right in property. Neither could have meaning without the other. Lynch v. Household Finance Corp., 405 U.S. 538, 552, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 1122, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972).\nWhile the recent decisions in the due process area have not reached the point of prohibiting procedures where redress can only be obtained in subsequent suits, they have made clear that where the governmental action does not serve a particularly urgent need an individual deprived of his property is entitled to more than the availability of a subsequent suit for redress. See, e. g., Fuentes v. Shevin, 407 U.S. 67, 92 S.Ct. 1983, 32 L.Ed.2d 556 (1972); Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254, 90 S.Ct. 1011, 25 L.Ed.2d 287 (1970). Appellee has appropriately noted that many of these recent decisions involved state remedies providing for the resolution of private disputes. See, e. g., North Georgia Finishing, Inc. v. Di-Chem, Inc., 419 U.S. 601, 95 S.Ct. 719, 42 L.Ed.2d 751 (1975); Board of Regents v. Rott, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). We have been cautioned that \u201cdue process is flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation demands.\u2019\u2019 Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471, 481, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). See also Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334\u201435, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976).\n[Consideration of what procedures due process may require under any given set of circumstances must begin with a determination of the precise nature of the government function involved as well as of the private interest that has been affected by governmental action. Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 895, 81 S.Ct. 1743, 6 L.Ed.2d 1230 (1961). To say that the concept of due process is flexible does not mean that judges are at large to apply it to any and all relationships. Its flexibility is in its scope onc\u00e9 it has been determined that some process is due; it is a recognition that not all situations calling for procedural safeguards call for the same kind of procedure. Morrissey v. Brewer, supra at 481, 92 S.Ct. at 2600.\nEven with the expanded perception of the requirements of procedural due process, the Court has nonetheless recognized the right of the government to seize property without affording the property owner a predeprivation or prompt postdeprivation hearing where the governmental interest involved is particularly urgent. See Colero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U.S. 663, 94 S.Ct. 2080, 40 L.Ed.2d 452 (1974) (seizure of yacht carrying contraband); Ewing v. Mytinger & Asselberry, Inc., 339 U.S. 594, 70 S.Ct. 870, 94 L.Ed. 1088 (1950) (misbranded drugs); Coffin Bros. & Co. v. Bennett, 277 U.S. 29, 48 S.Ct. 422, 72 L.Ed. 49 (1928) (bank failure); Stoehr v. Wallace, 255 U.S. 239, 41 S.Ct. 293, 65 L.Ed. 604 (1921) (a wartime emergency); North Am. Cold Storage Co. v. City of Chicago, 211 U.S. 306, 29 S.Ct. 101, 53 L.Ed. 195 (1908) (a contagion that has threatened the public). This is particularly significant in view of the traditionally accepted importance of the tax collection process to the perpetuation and the continuing vitality of government. Supportive of the fact that the summary process may still be resorted to in the tax collection process was the relatively recent affirmance of the Phillips decision in Fuentes v. Shevin, supra at 92, 92 S.Ct. 1983 n. 24.\nCedarbrook argues that Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Shapiro, 424 U.S. 614, 96 S.Ct. 1062, 47 L.Ed.2d 278 (1976), compels us to find that due process now requires, even in tax collection matters, a predeprivation or at least a prompt postdeprivation hearing. Their reliance is placed upon the following language in that opinion:\nThis Court has recently and repeatedly held that, at least where irreparable injury may result from a deprivation of property pending final adjudication of the rights of the parties, the Due Process Clause requires that the party whose property is taken be given an opportunity for some kind of predeprivation or prompt post-deprivation hearing at which some showing of the probable validity of the deprivation must be made.\nCommissioner of Internal Revenue v. Shapiro, supra at 629, 96 S.Ct. at 1072 (Footnote omitted).\nFurther that Court stated:\nAccordingly, neither the holding nor the dicta in Phillips support the proposition that the tax collector may constitutionally seize a taxpayer\u2019s assets without showing some basis for the seizure under circumstances in which the seizure will injure the taxpayer in a way that cannot be adequately remedied by a Tax Court judgment in his favor. Instead it would appear to be entirely consistent with our more recent holdings. Id. at 632, 96 S.Ct. at 1073.\nAlthough at first blush the above quoted portions of the Shapiro decision would appear to provide impressive authority for Cedarbrook\u2019s position, we are not convinced that a careful analysis of that case requires such a result. At the onset, it is significant that the Shapiro Court was not squarely confronted with a due process question. As the first paragraph of the decision indicates, the Court was called upon to determine the scope of the Internal Revenue Code\u2019s Anti-Injunction Act, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7421(a). More importantly, the remedy afforded the taxpayer in that case was much more restrictive than the language which Cedar-brook relies upon would suggest. First the Court followed its decision in Enochs v. Williams Packing Co., 370 U.S. 1, 82 5. Ct. 1125, 8 L.Ed.2d 292 (1962) and required as a prerequisite for injunctive relief that the taxpayer show extraordinary circumstances causing irreparable harm for which the statutory scheme does not provide an adequate remedy and also demonstrate that under the most liberal view of the law and the facts the government could not establish its claim. The relief provided by the Shapiro Court was only to require the government to supply the taxpayer with the basis for the jeopardy assessment and levy. Accepting as we must, that the Shapiro Court did not envision due process as providing more protection to the taxpayer than its interpretation of the Anti-Injunction Act would permit, it is clear that where the basis of the tax assessment is known to the taxpayer, as is clearly the case in the instant appeal, the right to injunctive relief is available only if the taxpayer can establish that the taxing authority could not possibly prevail in its tax claim.\nHere, although the basis for the tax liability is disputed, it is known to the taxpayer. Further, it is apparent that the record at this preliminary stage does not justify a finding that the taxing authorities cannot prevail on their claims. Thus, we cannot agree that Shapiro requires a finding that the Chancellor erred in denying preliminary injunctive relief. Further, we do not accept the view that Shapiro mandates a blanket disavowal of our prior cases in which we have sustained tax statutes where relief was limited to suits for redress. See, e. g., Rockhill Iron and Coal Co. v. Fulton Co., 204 Pa. 44, 53 A. 530 (1902).\nUnder the circumstances presented in this matter, we are satisfied that the taxpayer\u2019s rights are not violated by requiring in the Third Class County Assessment Law that claims be channelled into an administrative hearing process followed ultimately by judicial review. The rationale for this procedure was forcefully delineated by this Court as follows:\n. the imperative necessity for prompt payment gives the complaining taxpayer but one remedy, and that is through appeal to the courts from the assessment or valuation. The very law which gives the appeal directs immediate payment, and then refunding the excess collected if the appeal be successful. He cannot resist or delay by litigation the tax collector who attempts to levy what the taxpayer thinks an unjust tax. His one and only remedy against unjust and discriminatory taxation is the one pointed out by the act of the assembly. And we must say that the legislature, in view of the absolute necessity of prompt payment, as well as the dissatisfaction and irritation caused by want of uniformity, was moved to make the remedy as ample as possible by the allowance of these appeals.\nRockhill Iron and Coal Co. v. Fulton County, supra, 204 Pa. at 47-48, 53 A. at 531.\nThe rationality of that legislative judgment is amply vindicated by the experience of municipalities and counties with defaulting property owners during the great depression as well as by the facts of the instant case in which one of the taxing authorities, the School District, was forced by Cedar-brook\u2019s nonpayment to borrow funds and pay interest thereon because of a shortfall in real estate taxes brought about by Cedarbrook\u2019s delinquency and to raise the millage rate for other taxpayers. Accordingly, we hold that rent sequestration undertaken pursuant to Section 19 of the Local Tax Collection Law of 1945 does not deprive appellant of Due Process where the taxpayer has recourse of payment of taxes under protest and appeal, as well as other enumerated statutory proceedings. See 72 P.S. \u00a7 5566b; 72 P.S. \u00a7 5566c. See, e. g., Matthews v. Rogers, 284 U.S. 521, 525-528, 52 S.Ct. 217, 76 L.Ed. 447 (1932); Aronoff v. Franchise Tax Board, 348 F.2d 9 (9th Cir. 1965); Helmsley v. City of Detroit, 320 F.2d 476 (6th Cir. 1963); Kimmey v. H. A. Berkeimer, 376 F.Supp. 49; aff\u2019d., 511 F.2d 1394 (3d Cir. 1975).\nCedarbrook further contends that Section 19 of the Local Tax Collection Law of 1945 was impliedly repealed by the provisions of the Real Estate Tax Sale Law of 1947 which does not authorize the remedy of sequestration of rents. Under the Pennsylvania Statutory Construction Act, a latter statute impliedly repeals the former only if it \u201cpurports to be a revision of all statutes upon a particular subject, or sets up a general or exclusive system covering the entire subject matter of a former statute and is intended as a substitute for such former statute\u201d; or \u201cpurports to establish a uniform and mandatory system covering a class of subjects\u201d or the two statutes are \u201cirreconcilable\u201d. 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1971. Since the 1947 Act was optional rather than mandatory in that the Tax Claim Bureau which it created became operative as to the county only if the county commissioners elected, by formal resolution, to accept it and in that it became operative as to municipal and school district taxing entities only if they notified the Tax Claim Bureau of a resolution to collect their delinquent taxes under and in accordance with its provision, appellant\u2019s claim that the Act \u201cpurports to establish a uniform and mandatory system covering a class of subjects\u201d is without merit. See 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.102. In Tremont Township School District v. Western Anth. Coal Co., 364 Pa. 591, 598, 73 A.2d 670, 674 (1950), this Court observed:\n. to say that the general Act of 1945 (the Local Tax Collection Law) which contains no local option provision, can be nullified as to certain counties of the state by their local exercise of an option conferred by an entirely different statute (the Real Estate Tax Sale Law) would be to carry repeal by implication to an unheard of extent.\nSimilarly, the optional nature of county, municipal and school district utilization of the tax collection process set up by the Real Estate Tax Sale Law of 1947 militates against any inference that the legislature intended by its enactment to set up \u201ca general or exclusive system covering the entire subject of the former statute\u201d and to \u201csubstitute for such former statute\u201d. Additionally, the very title and preamble of the 1947 law indicates that it does not purport to cover the entire subject of the 1945 statute.\nAppellant also contends that the legislature intended repeal of prior statutes which deal with the particular subject of in rem collection of delinquent real estate taxes by enactment of the 1947 statute, hence precluding local authorities from availing themselves of the remedy of rent sequestration. This argument is untenable. The collection process envisaged by the Real Estate Tax Sales Law is triggered only when tax claims are delinquent until May of the year following that in which the taxes are due. 72 P.S. \u00a7 5860.306. It must therefore follow, even under appellant\u2019s theory of the case, that at least until May of the year following that in which the taxes are due, the local tax collector is not pre-empted from taking statutorily authorized steps under the provisions of the Local Tax Enabling Act to collect those taxes. One of those statutorily authorized mechanisms for collection is, of course, summary rent sequestration. 72 P.S. \u00a7 5511.19. Otherwise, the legislature would have intended the absurd result that the establishment of a County Tax Claim Bureau to facilitate the collection of delinquent taxes impliedly displaced the local tax collector from all statutorily authorized in rem collection devices, rent sequestration included, thus gutting the local tax collector\u2019s enforcement powers. There is no evidence of any legislative intent to vest all local tax enforcement functions in the County Tax Bureau which would be the effect of holding that the 1947 statute was a revision of \u201call statutes\u201d upon the particular subject of in rem tax collection. Since, under the facts of the instant case, the local tax collector invoked the rent sequestration remedy at a time before that in which the County Tax Bureau is seized of enforcement jurisdiction, we need not determine whether, in the case of a conflict between the local tax collector and the County Tax Bureau, the latter\u2019s jurisdiction would prevail.\nFinally appellant contends that the 1945 statute is \u201cirreconcilable\u201d with the 1947 Act in that the prior statute authorizes sequestration by the local tax collector instead of the Bureau; in that it permits sequestration by summary proceedings rather than by judicial proceedings; and in that it would permit sequestration two years before the tax claim becomes absolute and without regard to the taxpayer\u2019s right to file exceptions under the 1947 Act. Compare 72 P.S. \u00a7 5511.19 (Local Tax Collection Law) with 72 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 5860.-811; 5860.314; 5860.401; 5860.402. The term, \u201cirreconcilable\u201d is not defined in the Statutory Construction Act. In view of the presumption against implied repeal, it is. authoritatively stated that this presumption may be overcome by a showing that \u201c . . . two acts are irreconcilable, clearly repugnant as to vital matters to which they relate and so inconsistent that the two cannot have concurrent operation\u201d. 1A Sands, Sutherland on Statutory Construction (4th ed.) \u00a7 23.10, p. 231 (1972) (emphasis supplied). As the Court has held in an analogous case, enactment of a new legal remedy does not necessarily imply the repeal of an earlier statutory remedy to enforce the same right since \u201cthere is nothing inherently inconsistent in the existence of two district statutory procedures for resolution of the same disputes, even though the result may be a lack of symmetry in the area\u201d. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission v. Sanders & Thomas, Inc., 461 Pa. 420, 336 A.2d 609 (1975). Appellant has shown that the two statutory schemes are different and may be overlapping. Such a showing does not amount to irreconcilability under Pennsylvania law. Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission v. Sanders & Thomas, Inc., supra; Parisi v. Philadelphia Zoning Board of Adjustment, 393 Pa. 458, 143 A.2d 360 (1958); Jenner Twp. Annexation Case, 208 Pa.Super. 62, 220 A.2d 385 (1966), aff\u2019d., 423 Pa. 609, 225 A.2d 247 (1967).\nAccordingly, the Order of the Commonwealth Court affirming the Decree of the Chancellor is affirmed. Appellants to pay all costs.\nPOMEROY, former J., did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. This section provides:\nIn case any person who is the owner of real estate neglects or refuses to pay any tax levied against such real property, the tax collector of such taxes may any time thereafter notify in writing the tenant in possession of any such real property, that the owner thereof has failed to pay such tax, and request the payment of such tax together with any penalties and interest due thereon by such tenant out of any rent money then due and owing, or thereafter to become due and owing to such delinquent taxpayer. Upon receipt of such notice from the tax collector, the tenant in possession of any such real property shall deduct from any rent that is then, or may thereafter become due and owing to such delinquent owner, the amount of such delinquent tax and the penalties and interest due thereon, and pay the same over to the collector of such taxes. The proper receipt for such taxes and penalties and interest, if any, paid to the tax collector by any tenant shall be a good and sufficient voucher to offset any claim that such delinquent taxpayer may have against such tenant for any rent to the amount thereof.\n. There has been disagreement among the members of this Court as to when a constitutional challenge should require an exception to the general rule that the statutory remedy at law should be followed. See Borough of Green Tree v. Board of Property Assessment, 459 Pa. 268, 328 A.2d 819 (1974) (and cases cited therein). Under either view, equity has jurisdiction where the adequacy of the remedy is the basis of the complaint. The implied repeal of Section 19 argument would pose a more difficult question.
