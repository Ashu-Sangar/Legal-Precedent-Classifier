In all other respects the Petition is DENIED.\nThe issue, rephrased for clarity, is:\nDid the Superior Court err in finding sufficient reasonable suspicion based on a \u201cguns follow drugs\u201d presumption to justify a \u201cprotective search\u201d of Petitioner\u2019s pocketbook for weapons pursuant to Terry v. Ohio 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968)?\nIn addressing this issue, the parties are to discuss and address any alternative, intermediate investigative measures, short of a search, which police officers may have lawfully utilized under the circumstances of this case.
