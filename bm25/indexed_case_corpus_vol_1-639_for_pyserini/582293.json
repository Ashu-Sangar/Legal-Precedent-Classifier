{"id": "582293", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eoberts,\nMarjorie C. Day, the last surviving child of George E. and Ella E. Day, petitioned the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County for termination of a trust created by her father\u2019s will. Marjorie alleged the purpose for which the trust, which now has corpus of only $8,783.52, was established has become impractical. The orphans\u2019 court refused to terminate the trust and Marjorie appealed. We vacate and remand.\nIn his will, executed January 31, 1930, George E. Day provided that the residue of his estate be held in trust by Ms daughter Marion and the Lancaster Trust Company. He directed that the income from the fund be used to \u201cprovide for the comfortable maintenance and support\u201d of Marjorie. George E. Day died July 9, 1930.\nIn 1926 Marjorie contracted encephalitis lethargicia (sleeping sickness). When her father executed Ms will she was still suffering from the disease. At that time sleeping sickness was considered incurable, and testator apparently believed that Marjorie would never recover.\nIn 1943 Marjorie suddenly and completely recovered; she suffered no residual brain damage. After her recovery appellant became a college professor and is now retired. During this time she has managed her own affairs. Testator\u2019s wife Ella died in 1959. Testator\u2019s only other child, Marion L. Day, died ten years later without issue.\nAppellant\u2019s petition for termination of the trust requested the orphans\u2019 court to award her both the income and the corpus of the trust free of any restrictions. The court concluded that although Marjorie was the sole income beneficiary, one half the corpus was the subject of a remainder in the intestate heirs of Ella.\nTbe opinion of the orphans\u2019 court indicates that the court considered only the applicability of the common-law doctrine of termination by consent of the parties. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 337 (1959); Mussels Estate, 341 Pa. 1, 17 A.2d 411 (1941). Because the orphans\u2019 court believed that, before it could terminate the trust, the consent of all parties in interest was required, it refused termination. The court reasoned that the requisite consent of all interested parties could not be obtained because potential remainder-men could not be ascertained until the class closed at Marjorie\u2019s death. We conclude that the orphans\u2019 court erred in deciding that it could not terminate without the consent of the unascertained parties in interest.\nIn Pennsylvania the Legislature has considered the effect of unascertained heirs on trust termination. Section 6102(a) of the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, provides that a court having jurisdiction of a trust may terminate the trust in whole or in part if the settlor\u2019s original purpose has become impractical and termination would more nearly approximate the intent of the settlor. Before the court may order termination, notice of the proposed termination must be given to all parties in interest or their fiduciaries and a hearing must be held to ascertain whether the settlor\u2019s original purpose has become impractical.\n\u201c(c) Other powers.\u2014Nothing in this section shall limit any power of the court to terminate or reform a trust under existing law.\u201d\nConsent of all parties in interest is not a prerequisite to section 6102 termination. That section requires only that all such parties be provided notice of the proposed termination. Moreover, creation of a procedure for termination of impractical trusts without the consent of all parties in interest was the specific goal of the Legislature in enacting what is now section 6102. The original Commission\u2019s Comment to that section states: \u201cTermination of trusts, which have failed in their purpose and which have become oppressive or otherwise undesirable, has been impossible in numerous instances due to inability to secure the consent of persons unborn, unascertained, or not sui juris. The purpose of this section is to give relief in such cases.\u201d The Day trust appears to be a paradigmatic case for the application of section 6102.\nBecause the record does not indicate that the orphans\u2019 court held the hearing required by section 6102 (a) , we must remand. At the hearing, the court must determine whether the trust\u2019s purpose has become impractical and whether termination more nearly approximates the testator\u2019s intent. If the court decides both questions in the affirmative, it should terminate the trust and direct distribution in accordance with section 6102(b).\nDecree vacated. The case is remanded to the Orphans\u2019 Court Division of the Court of Common Pleas of Lancaster County for proceedings consistent with this opinion and entry of an appropriate decree. Costs to be paid by the trust.\nThis Court has jurisdiction by virtue of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 202(3), 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.202(3) (Supp. 1973), and 20 Pa. S. \u00a7 792 (Special Pamphlet, 1972).\nAny additional income was to be paid to testator\u2019s wife Ella during her natural life. Following Ella\u2019s death tbe additional income was to become tbe absolute property of testator\u2019s only daughter, Marion.\nAppellant expressly waived any other rights accruing under her father\u2019s will.\nThe will of George E. Day provided that when Marjorie and Ella died, the corpus of the trust should go to Marion, or if she be deceased, to her children. If Marion should die without issue before Marjorie, the will continued, the corpus should pass under the will of Ella.\nOne-half of Ella\u2019s estate was directed by her will to pass directly to Marion. Marion never married and died intestate. It thus appears that should the trust be terminated, Marjorie, as Marion\u2019s intestate heir, would be the beneficiary of this portion of the corpus.\nThe other half of Ella\u2019s estate was subject to alternative devises which events have made irrelevant. In default of these alternatives, the fund was to pass to Ella\u2019s \u201cnext of kin in accordance with the present intestate laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania\u201d (emphasis supplied). The orphans\u2019 court properly concluded that this provision required the \u201cnext of kin\u201d be determined by the intestate law in force when the will was written, The Intestate Act of 1917, Act of June 7, 1917, P.L. 429.\nThe orphans\u2019 court apparently declined to appoint a guardian or trustee ad litem for the potential unascertained heirs. Such an appointment is authorized by 20 Pa. S. \u00a7 3504 (Special Pamphlet, 1972). This section also authorizes the court to dispense with appointment of a trustee or guardian ad litem if there is a living person sui juris having an interest similar to that of the unascertained persons. This the orphans\u2019 court apparently also declined to do.\n20 Pa. S. \u00a7 6102 (Special Pamphlet, 1972). This section provides :\n\u201c(a) Failure of original purpose.\u2014The court having jurisdiction of a trust heretofore or hereafter created, regardless of any spendthrift or similar provision therein, in its discretion may terminate such trust in whole or in part, or make an allowance from principal to a eonveyor, his spouse, issue, parents, or any of them, who is an income beneficiary, provided the court after hearing is satisfied that the original purpose of the conveyor cannot be carried out or is impractical of fulfillment and that the termination, partial termination or allowance more nearly approximates the intention of the conveyor, and notice is given to aU parties in interest or to their duly appointed fiduciaries. But, distributions of principal under this section, whether by termination, partial termination, or allowance, shall not exceed an aggregate value of $25,000 from all trusts created by the same eonveyor.\n\u201c(b) Distribution of terminated trust.\u2014Whenever the court shall decree termination or partial termination of a trust under the provisions of this section, it shall thereupon order such distribution of the principal and undistributed income as it deems proper and as nearly as possibly in conformity with the conveyor\u2019s intention.\nSection 6102 by its terms permits distribution of principal with an aggregate value of up to $25,000 from all trusts created by the same settlor. The corpus of the only trust created by George E. Day is $8,783.52.\nEven before the enactment of \u00a7 6102 termination without the consent of all parties in interest was possible in certain circumstances. See Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7\u00a7 335, 336, 340(2) (1959); 4 A. Scott, Law of Trusts \u00a7\u00a7 335, 336, 340(2) (3d ed. 1967).\nThe orphans\u2019 court may satisfy the notice requirement by appointing a trustee or guardian ad litem for the unascertained remaindermen. Alternatively, appointment may be dispensed with if living persons adequately represent the interests of the remainder-men. 20 Pa. S. \u00a7 3504 (Special Pamphlet, 1972). See note 5 supra.\nThe court will, of course, consider the testator\u2019s original objectives as well as the present value of the trust res, the current cost of administration, and the amount of distributable income derived from the trust.

Although \u00a7 2 originally applied only to trusts created after the effective date of the Act (January 1, 1948, see id. \u00a7 21 (formerly 20 P.S. \u00a7 301.21 (1950))), a 1956 amendment made this section applicable to \u201ca trust heretofore or hereafter created.\u201d Act of February 17, 1956, P.L.

While courts apparently have ignored this possibility, it nevertheless exists.\u201d"}
