{"id": "1237105", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Drew,\nWilliam T. Houston died testate on September 20, 1949. By his will he provided that should his widow elect to take against his will, his two sons were to receive nothing. His widow did so elect and his sons filed exceptions to the proposed schedule of distribution alleging that the above clause was against public policy and void. The Orphans\u2019 Court of Lehigh County dismissed the exceptions and confirmed the account. One son, William T. Houston, Jr., has appealed.\nTestator\u2019s will was dated February 2, 1935. In it, he provided that after the payment of debts his entire estate, now totalling $120,036.38, should be left in trust with directions to pay to his widow the sum of $150.00 per month for life. Upon her death the two sons were to receive $50.00 a month each for life. The remainder was to go to the children of the sons when they attained the age of twenty-one. Paragraph 14 of the will, which gives rise to this dispute, provides: \u201cShould my wife, Anna Houston, elect to take against this, my last will and testament, I do hereby revoke and make void any provision or provisions for either or both of my sons . . .\u201d Then followed an alternative gift of the income to testator\u2019s sister during her life and her children during their lives.\nWhen the widow elected to take against the.will, the executor filed his account and proposed schedule of distribution. in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 14 and that account was confirmed by the learned court below. Appellant\u2019s principal argument is that Paragraph 14 places the widow in a position where she must either take the relatively small bequest given her by the will or by electing to take against the will effect the disinheritance of her children. It is his contention that to put the widow to such a choice is against public policy and the clause is therefore void.\nIt has. long been the. law of this Commonwealth .that a testator may make provisions to take'effect should his widow elect to take against his will' and that such provisions are valid: Alexander\u2019s Estate, 341 Pa. 471, 19 A. 2d 374; Kahl\u2019s Estate, 336 Pa. 376, 9 A. 2d 346; Carr\u2019s Estate, 138 Pa. 352, 22 A. 18; Mohn\u2019s Appeal, 76 Pa. 92. While the wisdom of including such a clause in a will may be open to question the law does not require that the distribution provided by will be wise or even equitable provided the testator has clearly expressed his intention: Friday\u2019s Estate, 150 Pa. Superior Ct. 352, 28 A. 2d 332. The public policy of Pennsylvania in regard to disinheritance of relatives is readily determined by an examination of the Wills Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89. Under that Act the only person who cannot be disinherited is the surviving spouse. Certainly then, if a testator may disinherit his children, he may also condition their legacies so that the happening of a certain event will result in their disinheritance. Here, it is true, the widow was faced with the unfortunate choice of receiving a small legacy or causing the children to lose their bequests, but that, once again, is a question of the wisdom of the testator and not public policy.\nAppellant argues that the condition attached to the gifts to the children was a condition subsequent and must be declared void as working a forfeiture. That same argument was made in Alexander\u2019s Estate, supra, and in Carr\u2019s Estate, supra. In both of those cases the rule was laid down that the widow\u2019s election to take under the will is a condition precedent to the vesting of the gift in the children. Since it is a condition precedent there can be no forfeiture.\nTestator, after providing in Paragraph 14 for the income to be paid to his sister for life and her children for their lives, then provided: \u201cUpon the death of any child of my sister, Mary Campbell, dying after my sister, I give, devise and bequeath a part or share of the corpus of the Trust Fund which shall be found by dividing the whole corpus by a number equal to the number of my sister\u2019s children living immediately before the time of the death of a child of my sister, and including in the number the child so dying as aforesaid.\u201d It is appellant\u2019s contention that this clause fails to make a disposition of the remainder and that this failure was deliberate. We fail to see any relevance of this argument to the issues here raised. Whether that clause fails as a gift over and if so, whether the failure was intentional or the inadvertent result of faulty draftsmanship is entirely immaterial to this case. The fact is that there is a valid trust created under Paragraph 14 which became effective when the widow elected to take against the will. Any question as to who receives the remainder upon the termination of the trust cannot affect the validity of the trust itself. See Quigley\u2019s Estate, 329 Pa. 281, 198 A. 85, where it was held that questions as to the validity of a gift over may be decided only upon the termination of the valid preceding interests.\nThe learned court below properly held that the provisions of testator\u2019s will here disputed are valid and enforceable. Accordingly, the entry of a decree ordering distribution in conformity with those provisions was correct.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s costs.\nA codicil, dated September 9, 1949, was later added solely\u2019 for tbe purpose of changing' the. executor and trustee. .. In', all Other respects, tbe provisions..of..the. will remained unchanged. \u2022 \u2022 \u2022..'"}
