{"id": "1887263", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nThis is an appeal from the judgment entered after the denial of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial on the ground that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. The scope of our review is to determine whether the court below clearly abused its discretion or committed an error of law in refusing to set aside the verdict of the jury. Menyo v. Sphar, 409 Pa. 223, 186 A. 2d 9 (1962).\nAt the trial below, appellant asserted that he was injured while riding as a passenger in defendant-appellee\u2019s bus when it collided with additional defendantappellee\u2019s car. The accident occurred while both vehicles were proceeding slowly in rush-hour traffic and the resulting impact was of a slight nature. Appellant testified that over a four year period subsequent to the accident he incurred medical bills of $4,202.95 and lost wages in the amount of f2,553.25, all of which he attributed to the accident.\nWhether or not appellant\u2019s injuries were in fact caused by the slight impact resulting from the collision of the two vehicles was a question for the jury. In deciding this causality problem, the jury was free to disregard the medical opinions offered by appellant\u2019s witnesses. See Gaita v. Pamula, 385 Pa. 171, 122 A. 2d 63 (1956). Hence the court below did not abuse its discretion in refusing to set aside the verdict of the jury.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents."}
