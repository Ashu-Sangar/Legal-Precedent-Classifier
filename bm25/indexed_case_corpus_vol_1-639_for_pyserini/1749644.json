{"id": "1749644", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nLinda Badger and two co-defendants were arrested on March 18, 1974, and charged with criminal conspiracy, delivery, and possession of a controlled substance, namely heroin. On September 30,1974, Badger appeared before the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming County and expressed an intention to plead guilty. The Commonwealth was then asked to detail the facts of the case. Following an oral recitation of the alleged facts by the district attorney, defense counsel challenged the accuracy of a portion of the district attorney\u2019s summary, which implied Badger was the ringleader in the criminal transaction. Thereupon, the court asked Badger if she were admitting the facts as recited by the district attorney, and when she replied in the negative defense counsel requested permission to withdraw the guilty plea and the motion was granted.\nFollowing the foregoing, Badger entered a plea of not guilty and, without objection by defense counsel, a nonjury trial proceeded before the same judge before whom the guilty plea had been entered. Badger was found guilty and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five to twelve years.\nOn appeal to the Superior Court, the judgment of sentence was affirmed. Badger filed a petition for allowance of appeal, and we granted the petition.\nIn the Superior Court, Badger was represented by new counsel who asserted trial counsel was ineffective, see Commonwealth v. Dancer, 460 Pa. 95, 331 A.2d 435 (1973), in failing to seek recusation of the judge following the withdrawal of Badger\u2019s guilty plea. The same issue was presented in Badger\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal and is now presented to this Court. Since we conclude this issue warrants reversal of the judgment of sentence, we shall not consider the other issues presented.\nThe Superior Court reasoned that, had a motion to recuse been made, it would have constituted reversible error to deny it, but that counsel could not be deemed ineffective for failing to make the motion because the chances of success before another judge were not substantially greater than they were before the judge who heard the plea since the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was particularly strong.\nIn this context, the test for determining the effectiveness of counsel is whether \u201c. . the particular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate his client\u2019s interests.\u201d [Emphasis in original.] Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 604, 235 A.2d 349, 352 (1967). Instantly, no reasonable basis for not requesting recusation is advanced and apparently there is none. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s failure to request recusation constitutes ineffectiveness and thus a new trial must be granted.\nThe Commonwealth\u2019s argument to the contrary is based on the majority opinion of the Superior Court. That opinion in essence reasoned that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was so strong that it would be a futile gesture for Badger\u2019s counsel to ask for trial before another judge. Such an assessment of the\n\u201c. . . strength of the prosecution\u2019s evidence against the defendant is, of course, one step in applying a harmless error standard. See Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.S. 427, 92 S.Ct. 1056, 31 L.Ed.2d 340 (1972); Harrington v. California, 395 U.S. 250, 89 S.Ct. 1726, 23 L.Ed.2d 284 (1969).\u201d\nCf. Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 383 A.2d 155, 165-66 (1978). Essentially, a harmless error standard seeks to determine whether the error had a prejudicial effect. Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. at 412-413, 383 A.2d at 166. See Commonwealth v. Davis, 452 Pa. 171, 305 A.2d 715 (1973); Schneble v. Florida, supra. Such an analysis in determining whether counsel is effective cannot be used because\n\u201cassistance of counsel is among those \u2018constitutional rights so basic to a fair trial that their infraction can never be treated as harmless error.\u2019 \u201d Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 489, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 1181, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978) quoting from Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 23, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).\nThis is not to say that in determining whether a \u201cparticular course chosen by counsel had some reasonable basis designed to effectuate [a] client\u2019s interests,\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, supra, 427 Pa. at 604, 235 A.2d at 352, a court should not \u201cweigh the alternatives.\u201d Moreover, we reiterate that \u201c. . .a finding of ineffectiveness [can] never be made unless [it can be] concluded that the alternatives not chosen offered a potential for success substantially greater than the tactics actually utilized.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, supra, 427 Pa. at 605, n. 8, 235 A.2d at 353, n. 8. But in examining the alternatives, a court may not utilize a harmless error analysis, and the alternatives must be examined only as a means of determining whether the course chosen had some reasonable basis.\nDisregarding the harmless error analysis instantly, the alternative of having a judge, who was not aware of the plea, try the case would have offered a \u201cpotential for success substantially greater than\u201d the tactics used. Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, supra, 427 Pa. at 605, n. 8, 235 A.2d at 353.\nJudgment of sentence reversed and new trial ordered.\n-O\u2019BRIEN, J., concurs in the result.\nPOMEROY, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nNIX, J., joins in Part I of dissenting opinion by POMER-OY, J.\n. Judge Price concurred in the result. Judge Spaeth filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Badger also argues: 1) the trial court improperly excluded a hearsay statement; and, 2) the judgment of sentence is \u201cmanifestly excessive so as to inflict too severe a punishment on\u201d Badger.\n. The Commonwealth does not contest this portion of the Superior Court\u2019s analysis."}
