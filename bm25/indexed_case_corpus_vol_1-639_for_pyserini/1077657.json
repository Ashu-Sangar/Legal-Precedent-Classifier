{"id": "1077657", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Moschzisker,\nThe controversy here involved arises out of the will of Alexander V. Murphey, who died October 12, 1895. He placed his residuary estate, real and personal, in trust to pay the income to his surviving children and the issue of those who predeceased him, \u2014 such issue in each instance to take between them the share their parent would have taken if living, \u2014 and at the death of any-surviving child, to that child\u2019s issue in like manner, until the death of the last' survivor of his (the testator\u2019s) children; then the will provides as follows: \u201cEighth: I direct......if any of my children,......their heirs, executors and administrators shall claim demand [or] prosecute any action or suit for any claims against me or my estate other than what I have so hereinbefore devised and given him her or them, or any of them, then ......the several legacies and bequests hereby by me before given or intended to be given to him, her or them or any of them, shall cease and be void to all intents and purposes, anything to the contrary notwithstanding; and in that case I order......that the share which he, she or they would have inherited or taken, shall be divided and distributed among my other children aforesaid......Ninth: from and immediately after the death of the last survivor of my children, all the residue of my estate......I desire and direct [shall] be divided and distributed among and between my legal heirs in such portions and shares as they may be justly and legally entitled t'o receive according to the laws of the State of Pennsylvania.\u201d\nThe last of testator\u2019s children died October 7, 1921, and the trust' terminated; thereupon the question arose, whether the \u201clegal heirs\u201d contemplated by testator were to be ascertained as of the date of his death or the date of the death of his last surviving child.\nThe auditing judge, being of opinion that the last-mentioned date controlled, refused to award any portion of the principal to the executors of Mary E. Stockton, a daughter of testator, who survived her father and died, without issue, in 1902. The orphans\u2019 court sustained exceptions and directed that the residuary estate be distributed to the personal representatives of testator\u2019s five children, all of whom were living at his death; from the final decree of the court below to this effect, the present appeals are brought.\nAppellants contend that, from the will itself, without regard to rules of construction, it is evident testator intended the estate in question to pass to his descendants, whoever they might be, on the death of his last child; and, to sustain this position, they argue that when, in the eighth paragraph of his will, testator forbade his children, and their \u201cheirs, executors and administrators,\u201d from making any claim \u201cother than what I have so hereinbefore devised and given them,\u201d he showed his intention to limit their interests to life estates. Standing alone, these words might lend some force to appellants\u2019 contention; but the claims to which testator refers are demands either against himself or his estate (\u201cagainst me or my estate\u201d), and the gifts to be forfeited, if such demands should be made, are \u201clegacies and bequests hereby by me before given\u201d; then, later in the same sentence, the will provides that, if any child make such claim, \u2018the share which he, she or they would have inherited or taken, shall be divided and distributed among my other children aforesaid.\u201d When read together, these provisions cannot be said to show clearly an intent of testator to deprive any of his children of an interest in the principal of his residuary estate, which is not mentioned or disposed of till the following (9th) paragraph of the will; and, even if we view it otherwise, considering, that the forfeited interests go to enlarge the shares of his \u201cother children,\u201d it would look as though testator considered these legatees as having vested interests. The 8th paragraph probably was intended to apply to the dispositions theretofore made, not to the principal of the residuary estate; also, testator (who, the will shows, had financial dealings with his children) probably had in mind, when he drew the 8th paragraph, claims against his estate of an adverse nature. Be these points as they may, however, the paragraph under discussion does not throw sufficient light on the question here involved to control the interpretation of the will.\nThe postponing payment of the principal of his residuary estate was evidently intended for the purpose of carrying out testator\u2019s scheme to create a trust to protect the estate, and facilitate the distribution of income therefrom, throughout the lifetime of his children; it was not on account of the character of those who ultimately were to receive such principal. Hence, the rule in Rosengarten v. Ashton (228 Pa. 389) does not apply: see Groninger\u2019s Est., 268 Pa. 184, 191.\nThe rule in Buzby\u2019s Appeal, 61 Pa. 111, 114, 116, controls. There the testator devised real estate to a trustee for the use of his son William, for life, and after the latter\u2019s decease, in trust for his children and the lawful issue of deceased children, and, for want of such child or children or lawful issue, then in trust for the use of his (testator\u2019s) \u201cright heirs\u201d forever, and the question arose as to whether testator\u2019s \u201cright heirs\u201d were the \u201cpersons who were his heirs at his death......or those who were his heirs at the death of his son William.\u201d In holding the former class took the estate, we said it is a \u201cwell settled\u201d rule of the construction that \u201ca devise or bequest to heirs, or heirs at law, of a testator,......will be construed as referring to those who are such at the time of the testator\u2019s decease unless a different intent is plainly manifested by the will.\u201d This rule has been frequently followed since: see McFillin\u2019s Est., 235 Pa. 175, 177; Tatham\u2019s Est., 250 Pa. 269, 276; and Groninger\u2019s Est., 268 Pa. 184, 188.\nThere is no difficulty in distinguishing the instant case from Leech\u2019s Est., 274 Pa. 369, recently decided by us, and involving much the same question. In that case the testator created certain trusts and life estates, and finally directed that \u201cafter these trusts have been fully executed then the said property shall descend and go as my estate according to the then existing laws of Pennsylvania.\u201d It was held that distribution should be made to the heirs and next of kin of the testator ascertained at the time the trust terminated, in accordance with his intent, clearly expressed by twice using the word \u201cthen\u201d as an adverb of time. If, on the other hand, \u201cthen\u201d had been used as a conjunction, signifying mere contingency, no such expression of intent would have been apparent. See Buzby\u2019s App., supra, p. 116.\nWhen the present will is read as a whole, we feel the probabilities are that testator had two paramount desires : he wanted his residuary estate kept in trust for his children till the death of the last of them; then he wished it divided, as his estate, according to the intestate law, \u2014 that is to say, as it would have been divided had he left no will; and this the rule adhered to by the court below accomplished.\nThe decree is affirmed at the cost of appellants."}
