{"id": "829783", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis record is free from error. The offer of evidence referred to in the first specification was properly rejected. The suit before the alderman was for a different cause of action. The one was for the beer sold and delivered, the other was for the empty barrels. The attempt to use the record of the alderman as a bar to this suit was evidently an afterthought, as no reference was made to it in the affidavit of defence. Judgment affirmed."}
