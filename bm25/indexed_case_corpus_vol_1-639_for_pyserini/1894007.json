{"id": "1894007", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Musmanno,\nOn August 5, 1961, Kenneth B. Polley was driving his automobile, with his wife and children as passengers, on Route 22 in Allegheny County when it came into violent collision with a tractor-trailer owned by the Atlantic Refining Company and being operated by Robert G. Cochran. As a result of the accident, Tolley\u2019s wife and a daughter were killed and two of his other children were seriously injured. The tractor-trailer was damaged to the extent of a repair bill amounting to $1131.02.\nThe Atlantic Refining Company (hereinafter referred to as Atlantic) claimed that the collision was due to the negligence of Kenneth Polley and demanded payment of him for the repair bill. Polley\u2019s insurance carrier, the Ohio Casualty Insurance Company, agreed to pay Atlantic $1131.02 in full settlement of all claims it and its driver Robert G. Cochran might have against Kenneth Polley. After some negotiations, including exchange of letters, an agreement was reached between the parties and, on November 13,1961, the Ohio Casualty paid to Atlantic $1131.02. In consideration for this payment, Atlantic turned over to Ohio Casualty, in behalf of Kenneth Polley, a release which reads as follows:\n\u201cRelease oe All Claims\n\u201cKnow Ye, that I/We Atlantic Refining Company and Robert Glen Cochran For and in consideration of the sum of One thousand one hundred and thirty-one and 02/100 Dollars ($1131.02 \u2014 ) to me/us in hand paid by Kenneth B.

Barnes.\nState of Pennsylvania )\nCounty of Philadelphia ) ss\nIt would be difficult to conceive of a durable umbrella with a greater diameter and circumference to protect Kenneth Polley from financial claims rising from the event of August 5, 1961, and falling down upon all parties involved in its tragic periphery, than this release. Nevertheless, when suits were brought by the Polley family against Atlantic and Robert Cochran, Atlantic joined Kenneth Polley as an additional defendant, averring he was solely responsible for the accident or, in the alternative, jointly responsible with Atlantic. Polley pleaded the release of November 7, 1961, and moved for judgment on the pleadings, which the Court granted, dismissing Atlantic\u2019s complaint.\nAtlantic appealed, two cases being involved. It argues that tbe release in question was not intended by tbe parties to include a release of any future rights in the original defendant to join Polley as an additional defendant or to preclude it from claiming contribution. This contention, while forcibly advanced, shatters against the stone wall of the release which in the most comprehensive language possible states that Atlantic and Cochran \u201cremise, release, acquit, and forever discharge\u201d Polley from \u201cany and every claim, demand, right or cause of action of whatever kind or nature . . . arising from an accident which occurred on or about the fifth day of August, 1961, at or near Carnegie, Penna, for which I/We have claimed the said Kenneth B. Polley to be legally liable.\u201d The release itself is entitled \u201cRelease of All Claims\u201d. Above the signatures of Atlantic and Cochran appears the admonition: \u201cRead Carefully Before Signing.\u201d\nAtlantic cannot assert that its representative did not know what he was signing, or that he was not familiar with the circumstances of the case. Nor can Atlantic assert, with any degree of intellectual confidence, that there was no possibility that a trespass suit would be brought against it because of the disastrous accident of August 5, 1961. Atlantic\u2019s truck had been damaged but the Polley family had lost two lives and three others of the family had sustained serious injuries. It was thus on notice that the Polley family, including Kenneth Polley himself, could sue and, in all probability, would sue for mortal losses they had suffered and physical hurts they had sustained.\nIt is possible that Atlantic, through its agents, felt secure that it could successfully resist any possible lawsuit brought against it and that, therefore, it was content to receive $1131.02 from Polley, but in any event, it could not have regarded the payment as a gratuity. Polley paid this money to be relieved of all claims that Atlantic might have against him. What was the specific consideration for the $1131.02? The promise by Atlantic that from now on it had no claim of any kind or nature against Polley.\nWhen an original defendant brings an additional defendant into a lawsuit, his action is not aimed at assisting the plaintiff, but at benefitting himself. His objective is to shift the blame from himself to the additional defendant, or, if they are both liable, to compel contribution from the additional defendant. And this is exactly what Atlantic gave up, namely, the right to make Polley stand beside it in any possible battle with the Polleys. That is why Kenneth Polley paid $1131.02. He paid it, in order, so far as Atlantic was concerned, not to have any further liability of any kind or nature arising out of the happening of August 5, 1961.\nThe defendant brings into argumentative focus three letters which exchanged between Atlantic and Polley\u2019s insurance carrier, contending that the $1131.02 represented only the cost of the truck repair bill and therefore, could constitute no release from personal injury claims. These three letters antedated the release and therefore must be deemed to have been merged into the release. Thus, they cannot be used to vary the terms of the written release. Moyer v. Independent Oil Co., Inc., 401 Pa. 335. In addition, the letters do not foreclose the conclusion that in consideration of payment of the truck damages, Polley was being released completely in all phases of liability arising from the accident, as specifically and expressly stated in the release. In fact, the letter from Polley\u2019s insurance carrier insisted that the release be signed also by Cochran, who could have had some claim for personal injuries, \u2014 and he did sign. Thus, contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, more than property damage was considered in the pre-release stages.\nThe lower Court here cited, as authority for its action, the case of Killian v. Catanese, 375 Pa. 593. The appellant argues that the Killian case is not applicable. But it is. Indeed, the language in the release involved in the Killian case is not dissimilar to the one in the release here under appellate review. The release there stated that for |250 consideration, the defendants \u201c \u2018do hereby remise, release and forever discharge George Wasilky, his heirs, executors and administrators, of and from all, and all manner of, actions and causes of actions, suits, debts, dues, accounts bonds, covenants, contracts, agreements, judgments, claims and demands whatsoever in law or equity, especially the liability arising out of the accident on or about April 5, 1952, at or about 9th and Passyunk Avenues in the City and County of Philadelphia.\u2019 \u201d\nThe Killian decision was not limited to holding that the release barred the defendants merely from making claim for contribution from Wasilky. There, as here, the original defendants claimed that Wasilky\u2019s negligence caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries. Wasilky relied on the release given him by the original defendants. The lower court, in an opinion, which we affirmed per curiam, stated that the release barred the defendants \u201cfrom bringing in George Wasilky as an additional defendant when plaintiff commenced her action.\u201d It further said that \u201cno attempt was made to limit the scope of the release to claims and demands of the original defendant.\u201d Thus, the Killian case holds that, because of the language there employed in the release, the original defendants were wholly barred from joining Wasilky as an additional defendant, it not being important whether the joinder was based on the theory of proving sole liability over to the plaintiff or to protect the right of contribution.\nOf course, this does not mean that at the trial of the instant case, Atlantic may not introduce evidence to exculpate itself from liability by showing that the sole cause of the accident was Kenneth Polley and not Robert G-. Cochran, its driver. Atlantic may still evidentially fasten the blame on Polley, not as a party in the lawsuit but to exonerate itself from the charge of negligence.\nAtlantic may not argue that, by denying it the right to make Kenneth Polley an additional defendant, the plaintiffs suffer a loss. No chain of reasoning could connect the defendant\u2019s objectives with an altruistic interest in the plaintiff\u2019s case. It was within Atlantic\u2019s determination to charge Kenneth Polley with sole or joint responsibility for the accident, but it contracted away that determination by accepting a money consideration from Kenneth Polley. It is too late now for Atlantic to renounce the contract by maintaining that it had an intention other than what it unambiguously expressed in the release which it and Cochrane signed.\nThe appellant argues that Davis v. Miller, 385 Pa. 318, is authority here, not Killian. In the Davis case, we had before us a release which we stated was \u201ccouched in practically the same language as that in the Killian case\u201d and we declared that by such release \u201che [the original defendant] clearly surrendered any claim he might have had to recover from the additional defendant by way of contribution or otherwise.\u201d However, in Davis, there was an additional fact present which put Killian in abeyance, namely, not only was there a release from the defendant to the additional defendant, but there was in addition a release from the plaintiff to the additional defendant. We expressly stated that this additional fact made Killian inapplicable because the additional defendant had given the plaintiff a release which stated \u201c \u2018That any damages, recoverable by the Undersigned, against or from all the other joint tortfeasors, shall be reduced to the extent of the pro rata share of said damages which the parties released hereby, except for this release, would otherwise have to pay.\u2019 \u201d We held that \u201cit was therefore clear that an important factor in the determination of the amount of damages that Miller [the original defendant] may be required to pay to plaintiffs is whether or not Mary Richardson [the additional defendant] would also have been liable to them had they not released her, \u2014 in other words, whether she was a joint tortfeasor with Miller.\u201d Therefore we declared that the defendant was entitled to have Mary Richardson a party of record because under the terms of the release given by the plaintiffs to Mary Richardson, the plaintiffs could only recover from the original defendant his pro rata share, or one-half, of the amount to which plaintiffs would otherwise have been entitled. Thus, our decision in Davis v. Miller in no way dulled the incisive effect of Killian v. Catanese. In fact, it affirmed that by such a release the original defendant \u201cclearly surrendered any claim he might have had to recover from the additional defendant by way of contribution or otherwise.\u201d\nThe defendant argues that somehow the release is not literally enforcible because it spoke in \u201cbroad stereotyped language.\u201d But the routineness of the printed form cannot lessen the legal significance of what is therein stated. It carried no handwritten contradictory terms nor was it so long and involved that the novitiate might be lost in labyrinthian passages. Neither were the controlling phrases hidden behind ambiguous verbal bushes, deceiving to the eye.\nAtlantic further asserts that it was deceived in that it was not informed that lawsuits were being contemplated against it. As we have already indicated, this was an eventuality which it could have anticipated. Even if future litigation seemed unlikely, it was a possibility which it could have guarded against by an appropriately stated condition in the agreement. Nor can one dismiss the possibility that if Atlantic had insisted on writing in such a condition, Polley\u2019s insurance carrier might have refused to pay for the property damage involved.\nWe also dismiss the contention that there was no consideration for Cochran\u2019s signing of the release because the $1131.02 was paid to Atlantic and not to him directly. It was this very payment to Cochran\u2019s employer which constituted consideration for Cochran\u2019s signature because this insulated him from claims against him for the property damage. In addition, the release contained a seal against Cochran\u2019s signature. That the instrument was intended as one under seal is evidenced by the wording: \u201cI/We have hereunto set my/our hand(s) and seal(s) . . .\u201d\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Eagen and Mr. Justice O\u2019Brien concur in the result.\nThe Wayne County Bank & Trust Company was plaintiff as administrator of the estates of Doris Polley and Sandra Polley, and guardian of Carla Polley and Linda Polley, minors. Kenneth Polley himself was declared incompetent after the accident and suit was entered through a guardian but he was later declared competent and the guardian was removed as a party."}
