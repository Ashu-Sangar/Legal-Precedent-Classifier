{"id": "1276885", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThe lower court refused to remove a nonsuit entered against the plaintiff in this action for the reason that he had failed to produce such evidence of the defendants\u2019 negligence as would entitle him to submit his claim to a jury. A review of the facts and the applicable law would serve no useful purpose. Since we find no error in the determination made by the lower court the judgment is affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Justice Musmanno dissents."}
