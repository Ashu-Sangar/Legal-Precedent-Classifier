{"id": "1747333", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant Richard E. Kenno, by his father, brought an action in trespass against appellees, the Department of State Police and the Department of General Services, two agencies of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and one official of each agency. The complaint sought compensation for injuries allegedly incurred when a state police vehicle struck the car in which appellants were riding. The Commonwealth Court dismissed the complaint against the Department of State Police and the Department of General Services on the grounds that, as agencies of the Commonwealth, they were protected by the sovereign immunity of the Commonwealth. It dismissed the complaint against the individual appellees on the ground that as \u201chigh public officials\u201d they were absolutely immune from civil liability for acts done within the scope of their authority.\nIn Mayle v. Pennsylvania Department of Highways, 479 Pa. 384, 388 A.2d 709 (1978), we abrogated the doctrine of sovereign immunity. In DuBree v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 481 Pa. 540, 393 A.2d 293 (1978), we concluded that the liability of officials of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation \u201cshould not have been analyzed solely on the basis of their status as employees of the Commonwealth.\u201d 481 Pa. at 543, 393 A.2d at 294. We vacate the order of the Commonwealth Court and remand for further proceedings consistent with both opinions.\nOrder of the Commonwealth Court vacated and case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nMr. Justice O\u2019BRIEN and Mr. Justice POMEROY would affirm the order of the Commonwealth Court as to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the reasons set forth in Mayle v. Pennsylvania Department of Highways, 479 Pa. 384, 406, 408, 388 A.2d 709, 720, 721 (1978) (O\u2019Brien, J., dissenting; Pomeroy, J., dissenting). In all other respects, Mr. Justice O\u2019BRIEN and Mr. Justice POMEROY join the Opinion of the Court.\nNIX, J., filed a concurring and dissenting opinion.\nEAGEN, C. J., dissents.\nWe hear this appeal pursuant to the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act of 1970, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, art. II, \u00a7 203, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.203 (Supp.1978)."}
