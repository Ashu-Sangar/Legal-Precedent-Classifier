{"id": "1261966", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearns,\nThis appeal concerns the construction of a holographic will, a photographic copy of which is as follows :\nTestator died February 20, 1954. He left to survive him as his only heirs two sons, John and Paul. According to the audit of the executor\u2019s account, the estate consists of $16,517.80. The auditing judge awarded the net estate to the two sons. Donald Swope, testator\u2019s nephew, contends that he should have been awarded a pecuniary legacy of $5,000. The pivotal question in construing the will is the meaning of the letters \u201cstieial\u201d. Judge Bowman, in his opinion, states: \u201cCounsel for exceptant concedes that it is meaningless and that there is no word which either sounds like or resembles this combination of lettersWe agree with this observation. It is contended by ex-ceptant that these unintelligible letters, whether read as \u201cstieial\u201d or \u201cstecial\u201d sound like special and hence testator\u2019s intent is apparent that his nephew not only was to be his executor and to take charge of his funeral, but was to receive \u201ca special bequest of $5,000.\u201d\nThere is little which we can profitably add to the opinion of the learned court below. In expounding a will, it is not what the testator may have meant, but Avhat is the meaning of his words. It does not extend to a consideration of what testator might have said, but did not say: Weidman\u2019s Appeal, 2 Walker 359; Estate of Andrew Nebinger, 185 Pa. 399, 39 A. 1049; Ludwick\u2019s Estate, 269 Pa. 365, 112 A. 543; Rosengarten Estate, 349 Pa. 32, 36 A. 2d 310; Myers Estate, 351 Pa. 472, 41 A. 2d 570; Leopold Estate, 356 Pa. 543, 52 A. 2d 458; Berger Estate, 360 Pa. 366, 61 A. 2d 855; Burpee Estate, 367 Pa. 329, 80 A. 2d 721; Britt Estate, 369 Pa. 450, 454, 87 A. 2d 243. A comprehensive statement of this principle is made by Mr. Justice Jones in Farmers Trust Company v. Wilson, 361 Pa. 43, 46, 63 A. 2d 14: \u201cIn Weidman\u2019s Appeal, 2 Walker 359, 361, 42 Leg. Int. 338 (1885), Mr. Justice Trtjnkey quoted with approval for this court to the effect that \u2018The question, in expounding a will is not what the testator meant, but what is the meaning of his words.\u2019 That pronouncement has since been reiterated by the courts of this State many times without question down to the present: e.g., Myers Estate, 351 Pa. 472, 474, 41 A. 2d 570; Rosengarten Estate, 349 Pa. 32, 38, 36 A. 2d 310; Brock Estate, 156 Pa. Superior Ct. 616, 619, 41 A. 2d 347; Tombs Estate, 155 Pa. Superior Ct. 605, 609, 39 A. 2d 367; etc. The principle, of course, does not mean that, where a testator\u2019s intention is clear, it may be disregarded on the basis of a literal interpretation of his testamentary words. But, it does mean that a testator\u2019s intent is not to be arrived at by the expounder\u2019s subjective deductions as to what the testator might have meant, or even perhaps did mean, but did not say: cf. Ludwick\u2019s Estate, 269 Pa. 365, 371, 112 A. 543. The scope of the inquiry is limited to the meaning of what the testatrix said.\u201d\nIn Morrison Will, 361 Pa. 419, 65 A. 2d 384, these principles were again restated. The case of Eaton v. Brown, 193 U. S. 411, was there cited, p. 421, in which Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes said \u201cThe English Courts are especially and wisely careful not to substitute a lively imagination. . . .\u201d In Rouse Estate, 369 Pa. 568, 87 A. 2d 281, where the suggestion was made in the court below that there might have been an accidental omission or oversight, we said (p. 573) : \u201cWe do not subscribe to the conjecture of the court in banc that The balance of express language as to the event which occurred was an oversight of the scrivener.\u2019 If there were an omission, such omission might not be remedied by judicial construction. In Grothe\u2019s Estate, supra, Justice Mestrezat said, p. 192: . . if it was an oversight, the courts have no authority to insert a provision . . . under the assumption that it was the intention of the testator. It is only when the language of the will expressly or by clear implication discloses the intention of the testator that the courts may carry it out. It will not do for the courts to undertake to guess at the intention of a testator and declare that to be his will. If he sees fit for any reason not to dispose of any part of his estate, or such is the result of ignorance or oversight, the courts cannot supply the gap or hiatus and reconstruct the will. To do so would be a perversion of the functions of the court, and deprive a testator of the right to dispose of his property.\u2019 See: Morrison Will, 361 Pa. 419, 65 A. 2d 384, and cases therein cited.\u201d\nWe do not agree with appellant that by eliminating consideration of the unintelligible word and the word \u201cbequeath\u201d, it is plain that the remaining words: \u201cI here by name my Nepew Donald Swope exectutor and ... the sum of $5.000 .. .\u201d indicate a legacy to the nephew. There are no dispositive words. Testator may \u25a0have so meant, but the words he employed do not so state. It is equally arguable that the words \u201cI here by . . . bequeath the sum of $5.000 and balance of my estate To [the sons] . . .\u201d is a devise and bequest to the sons. True, testator did not need to mention $5,000 if he intended to pass it with his residue. But this fact alone is not controlling. This Court will decline to surmise testator\u2019s intent by resorting to speculation or conjecture. The sons, the heirs of testator, are the natural objects of testator\u2019s bounty. Where the usual, natural, just and legal course of distribution is to be changed, it must be done by words reasonably free from ambiguity: Weber\u2019s Appeal, 17 Pa. 474; Hirsh\u2019s Trust Estate, 334 Pa. 172, 177, 5 A. 2d 160.\nThe decree is affirmed. Costs to be paid from the estate."}
