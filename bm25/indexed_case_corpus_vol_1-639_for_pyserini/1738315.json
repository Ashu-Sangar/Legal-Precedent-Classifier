The motion to strike alleged the release was obtained in violation of the Act of June 9, 1972, P.L. 359, No. 97, \u00a7 1, 12 P.S. \u00a7 1630 (Supp.1977-78). The defendant-appellant appealed from the order granting the motion to strike to the Superior Court. The Superior Court affirmed per curiam. The defendant-appellant filed a petition for allowance of appeal and we granted the petition.\nThe order of the Court of Common Pleas is interlocutory, see Adcox v. Pennsylvania Mfrs. Ass\u2019n Cas. Ins. Co., 419 Pa. 170, 213 A.2d 366 (1965), and hence, the Superior Court erred in entertaining an appeal therefrom in the absence of a certification pursuant to Section 501(b) of the Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act, Act of July 31, 1970, P.L. 673, No. 223, \u00a7 501(b), 17 P.S. 211.501(b) (Supp.1977-78).\nAccordingly, the order of the Superior Court is vacated and the record is remanded to the Court of Common Pleas with a procedendo.\nWe express no view on the merits of the issue which resulted in the Court of Common Pleas order granting the motion to strike.\nLARSEN, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which MANDERINO, J., joins."}
