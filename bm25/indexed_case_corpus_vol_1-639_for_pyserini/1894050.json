{"id": "1894050", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Cohen,\nThis is an appeal by the defendant, Borough of Churchill, from the decree of the lower court restraining it \u201cfrom interfering in any shape, manner, or form with the construction of the proposed 500,000 gallon elevated [water] tank at the site of Reservoir No. 5. as proposed by plaintiff, Wilkinsburg-Penn Joint Water Authority.\u201d The decree became absolute on April 8, 1964.\nPlaintiff-appellee (Authority) is a joint municipal authority, incorporated by the Borough of Wilkins-burg and the Township of Penn Hills under the Municipal Authorities Act of 1945. Act of May 2, 1945, P. L. 382, \u00a71 et seq., 53 P.S. \u00a7301 et seq. Its function is to provide public water service for consumption, health, and fire protection. Defendant-appellant (Borough) is a Borough, regulated by The Borough Code, Act of July 10, 1947, P. L. 1621, \u00a71 et seq., 53 P.S. \u00a745001 et seq. The Authority supplies water service to more than 20 boroughs and townships including defendant Borough.\nIn 1949, the Authority purchased a five or six acre tract of land in the Borough, on which it constructed a 10,000,000 gallon reservoir. The parties agree that for years preceding this litigation the Authority\u2019s water pressure has been inadequate to meet expanding needs in its \u201chigh service area,\u201d which includes defendant Borough. For some time the Authority has wanted to improve its service by building a 500,000 gallon elevated water tank on the same land in the Borough where the aforementioned reservoir is located. The Borough\u2019s zoning ordinances prohibit such a structure. It further appears that, since 1954, the Borough has taken the position that the Authority-should solve this service problem by a closed pressure pumping system which would not involve any structure that violates its zoning ordinances. The Authority, on the other hand, has continually maintained a decided preference for the elevated tank method of increasing pressure.\nIn 1954, the Authority requested a building permit for the aforementioned structure. It was denied as being in violation of the zoning ordinances. In 1959, the Authority submitted another application for a permit, which again was denied. The Authority then appealed to the Borough\u2019s board of adjustment for a variance, which also was denied. In June of 1961, the Authority applied again for a permit, which was refused; and again, the Authority appealed to the board of adjustment for a variance, which was also refused.\nIn 1961, after the Board refused the Authority\u2019s last request for a variance, the Authority filed a complaint in equity seeking to restrain the Borough from interfering with its proposed plan to construct an elevated water tank. Also, the Authority filed an appeal in the county court from the refusal of the Borough\u2019s board of adjustment to grant it a variance. The appeal from the board of adjustment was continued because of the pendency of the action in equity.\nThe Authority\u2019s complaint in equity averred, inter alia, that the Borough was threatening to forcibly, restrain it from erecting the water tower (presumably by enforcing the criminal provisions of the zoning ordinance), that such threat was interfering with its' proposed plans, and that such interference was wrongful and should be enjoined because the Authority was \u201cnot subject to defendant\u2019s zoning power with respect to the erection of the proposed water tower.\u201d The Borough filed preliminary objections urging that the complaint be dismissed because the Authority failed to pursue its statutory remedies, to wit, the appeal it had taken to the county court from the refusal by the board of adjustment to grant a variance.\nThe Authority contended before the lower court that, because of the provisions of the Municipal Authorities Act of 1945, as amended, it was not subject to the zoning article of The Borough Code and consequently need not pursue the procedure set forth therein. The provisions relied upon by the Authority grant it the power \u201cto determine by itself exclusively the services and improvements required to provide adequate, safe and reasonable service,\u201d with the right to challenge the \u201csafety and reasonableness of the Authority\u2019s services ... in the court of common pleas\u201d which has \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to determine all such questions involving rates or service.\u201d\nThe sole question, raised by the complaint and preliminary objections was whether the jurisdiction over the conduct of the Authority created by the Municipal Authorities Act precluded the exercise of the Borough\u2019s zoning jurisdiction over the Authority\u2019s property. If the lower court had decided that the Bor-, ough was so precluded it should have entered the injunction forthwith because, in such event, the only relief from the Authority\u2019s conduct would be by way of 'appeal under the Municipal Authorities. Act. If, on the other hand, the lower court had decided that the Borough was not so precluded it should have dismissed the complaint, because, in such event, the only relief from the Borough\u2019s conduct would be by way of appeal, from the board of adjustment\u2019s refusal to grant a variance.\nHowever, the lower court, en banc, took .neither of these courses. Instead, it decided that the basic question before it was a factual one, to wit, whether or not the proposed water tank was a necessary and proper exercise of discretion on the part of the Authority. Moreover, it decided that under the Municipal Authorities Act it had exclusive jurisdiction over this issue. Accordingly, it dismissed the preliminary objections, had a trial on the aforesaid issue, resolved it favorably to the Authority, granted the injunction prayed for, and dismissed exceptions to the adjudication.\nIn our opinion, the necessity or propriety of the Authority\u2019s water tank was not properly an issue before the lower court. The basic error pervading, the proceedings below was the failure of the lower court to find, as a matter of law, after the complaint and preliminary objections, that the property owned by the Authority is not immune from the zoning power of the Borough. Accordingly, the complaint should have been dismissed, because relief from the decisions of the zoning authorities, with respect to property over which they have jurisdiction, can be obtained only through the statutory procedures provided for the purpose. Jacobs v. Fetzer, 381 Pa. 262, 112 A. 2d 356 (1955).\nAs Ave said in White Oak Borough Authority Appeal, 372 Pa. 424, 93 A. 2d 437 (1953), where the conflict Avas between a Avater authority organized under the Municipal Authorities Act and the city of Mc-Keesport, the parties \u201chave only the power and authority granted them by enabling statutory legislation.\u201d Id., at p. 427. In -other Avords, the problem raised is one of statutory interpretation.\nFirst, under The Borough Code the express jurisdictional base for the exercise of the zoning power is all the real property in the borough. It is provided that: \u201c(a) For any or all said purposes, the council may divide the Borough into districts. . . . Within such districts it may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures, or land.\u201d NoAvhere in The Borough Code is the property OAvned by an Authority expressly excepted. Therefore, such property is subject to the jurisdiction of the zoning authorities unless an exception is provided by inference either from The Borough Code or the Municipal Authorities Act or some other legislative expression.\nThe Authority contends that the Municipal Authorities Act, which gives it the power to determine its services exclusively, with right of appeal confined to the court of common pleas, provides the necessary inference. It is argued that if the zoning power were applicable it would interfere with the Authority\u2019s power to exclusively determine its services, contrary to legislative intention. The argument is fallacious. When the Borough enacts and administers its zoning ordinances it is not \u201cdetermining\u201d the Authority\u2019s services. The zoning ordinances are simply part of the law of property nse. Like all law it has impact on the conduct of human affairs including the Authority\u2019s service decisions. In Hatfield Township v. Lansdale Municipal Authority, 403 Pa. 113, 168 A. 2d 333 (1961), we held that a water authority organized under the Municipal Authorities Act was subject to the doctrine of reasonable use of percolating waters, but it could not be persuasively maintained that the application of the doctrine violated the Authority\u2019s right to determine its services. As was said in Yezioro v. North Fayette County Municipal Authority, 193 Pa. Superior Ct. 271, 285, 164 A. 2d 129, 137 (1960), the word \u201cexclusively\u201d was simply intended \u201cto make it clear that the authority itself, not the creating municipality or some other instrumentality, controlled the initial determination of the services.\u201d The initial service decisions remain with the Authority, but they must be made within the framework of other applicable laws, unless the Legislature directs otherwise. Cf. Kingston Borough v. Kalanosky, 155 Pa. Superior Ct. 424, 38 A. 2d 393 (1944).\nSecond, The Borough Code contains one express exemption for buildings or extensions \u201cthereof used or to be used by public utility corporations, if upon petition of the corporation, the Public Utility Commission shall, after a public hearing, decide that the present or proposed situation of the building in question is reasonably necessary for the convenience or welfare of the public.\u201d The Public Utility Law provides that municipal water authorities are not \u201cpublic utilities.\u201d Our Statutory Construction Act provides that \u201c[exceptions expressed in a law shall be construed to exclude all others,\u201d Act of May 28, 1937, P. L. 1019, \u00a754, 46 P.S. \u00a7554, \u201cunless the application of such rul[e] would result in a construction inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature.\u201d Id., \u00a731, 46 P.S. \u00a7531. We do not perceive any such inconsistency here.\nThird, as \u201c[e]very law shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions,\u201d Id., \u00a751, 46 P.S. \u00a7551,.so too should statutes be correlated to give the fullest scope, to the various objectives envisaged by the Legislature. The purpose of and statutory scheme for regulating a municipal water authority compared with the purpose of and statutory scheme for regulating the Borough\u2019s zoning power supports the conclusion that the legislative, objectives will be more fully attained if the Authority is subject to the zoning power of the Borough.\nThe .Municipal Authorities Act and the Borough zoning power have the same general objectives, namely, to promote the health, safety and welfare of the people. But the provision of The Borough Code which sets forth the specific objectives of the zoning power provides that zoning \u201cregulations shall be made in accordance with a comprehensive plan, and designed to lessen congestion in the streets, to secure safety from fire panic and other dampers, to promote health and general welfare, to provide adequate light and air, to prevent the overcrowding of land, to avoid undue concentration of population, to facilitate adequate provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements.\u201d (Emphasis supplied). (53 P.S. \u00a748303). This provision indicates that the objectives of zoning regulation are more comprehensive than and, in fact, include the objectives of the water Authority. Correspondingly, to be valid, the zoning power must be exercised with due regard for the statutory requirement of \u201cfacilitat[ing] adequate provision of . . . water. . . .\u201d On the other hand, the direction in the Municipal Authorities Act that the Authority must provide \u201cadequate, safe and reasonable service\u201d would not require the Authority to make its service determinations with due regard to the comprehensive objectives of zoning, even if it had the ability to do so. Accordingly, the objectives of both statutes can be secured only if the Authority's land is subject to the Borough\u2019s zoning power. Thus, all rules of proper statutory construction lead to the same result.\nThe lower court and the Authority place great reliance on Duquesne Light Co. v. Upper St. Clair Township, 377 Pa. 323, 105 A. 2d 287 (1954). There, by enforcing its zoning ordinances, the township was prohibiting the building of certain power transmission lines. We held that a public utility, regulated by the Public Utility Commission, was not subject to the zoning power of a first class township because, otherwise, \u201ctownships, together with the Commission, and not the Commission alone, would regulate public utility companies.\u201d Id., at p. 334. The Authority argues that, by analogy, when the Legislature granted regulatory power over it to the common pleas courts it thereby intended to insulate it from the impact of zoning regulation. The analogy is not well drawn.\nThe Legislature has granted to the P.U.C. a vast and detailed, albeit not unlimited, regulatory authority over the services and facilities of public utilities. It is armed with the powers to initiate proceedings on its own motion and to issue detailed orders and regulations, and the utility must bear the burden of proof against it. The regulatory power in the hands of the common pleas courts over the conduct of authorities formed under the Municipal Authorities Act is not comparable to the P.TJ.C.\u2019s power over public utilities. The common pleas courts have no power of inquiry on their own motion, nor do they have power or the required staff necessary to prescribe rules and regulations governing the conduct of authorities. Moreover, the party attacking the conduct of an authority must not only bear the burden of proof but also must show that the authority acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner or abused its discretion. See Hyam v. Upper Montgomery Joint Authority, 399 Pa. 446, 454, 160 A. 2d 539, 544-545 (1960), and Lakemont Civic Association, Inc., v. Central Blair County Sanitary Authority, 199 Pa. Superior Ct. 125, 130, 184 A. 2d 301, 303-304 (1962). Clearly, these are not the standards applicable when the P.U.C. reviews the conduct of public utilities. Accordingly, since the Legislature has not developed a system of regulation of Municipal Authorities that is nearly so detailed, and broad as the regulation of public utilities there is no necessary inference, as there was in Duquesne, that the Legislature intended to insulate them from any impact that zoning might have on their conduct, in deference to another regulatory body.\nFurther, in Duquesne, there were two express indications by the Legislature that the zoning power should not impinge upon the P.U.C.\u2019s regulation of public utilities. Section 3110 of The First Class Township Code (the statute involved in Duquesne) provides \u25a0that the zoning article shall not apply to any existing or proposed building or extension thereof, used or to be used by a public service corporation if the P.U.C. decides that the situation of the building is reasonably necessary for the convenience or welfare of the people. (53 P.S. \u00a758110). Section 3502 of that Code provides \u201c[t]his Act shall not repeal or modify any of the provisions of the Public Utility Law. . . .\u201d (53 P.S. \u00a758502). No corresponding legislative intent appears in The Borough Code in regard to the common pleas courts\u2019 regulation of municipal authorities.\nThe Authority further contends that a local zoning authority will necessarily zone with a \u201clocal eye\u201d while the Authority may operate in many jurisdictions. This problem is of no moment for, as we have explained above, the zoning power must be exercised so as to \u201cfacilitate the adequate provision of . . . water . . . The propriety of the specific exercise of the zoning power, in light of the functions and requirements of the Authority, may be judicially tested, should the Authority feel dissatisfied. Moreover, the converse of the Authority\u2019s argument rings more true, to wit, that the Authority\u2019s \u201ceye\u201d in placing its facilities will not or cannot properly regard zoning objectives. All that we decide today is that the property owned by the Authority is subject to the zoning power of the Borough. Whether that power is being properly exercised is another question and must be decided within the statutory framework provided for that purpose.\nAccordingly, the decree of the lower court is vacated and the complaint dismissed. Costs on appellee.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell and Mr. Justice Musmanno dissent.\nA \u201chigh service area\u201d is one which cannot be serviced by gravity flow from the Authority\u2019s primary reservoir.\nSection 3301 of The Borough Code provides: \u201cFor the purpose of promoting health, safety, morals or the general welfare councils of boroughs are hereby empowered to regulate and restrict the height, number of stories, and size of buildings and other structures, their construction, alteration, extension, repair, maintenance, and all facilities and services in or about such buildings and structures and percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts and other open spaces, the density of population, and the location and use of buildings, structures and land for trade, industry, residence or other purposes, and may also establish and maintain building lines and set back building lines upon any or all public streets.\u201d (63 P.S. \u00a748301).\nSection 3302 of The Borough Code provides: \u201c(a) For any or all said purposes, the council may divide the borough into districts, of such number, shape, and area as may be deemed best suited to carry out the purpose of this article. Within such districts it may regulate and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures or land. All such regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of buildings throughout each district, but the regulations in one district may differ from those in another district.\u201d (53 P.S. \u00a748302).\nSection 3004 of The Borough Code provides: \u201cThe Council shall exercise the powers granted in this article by ordinance. . . .\u201d (53 P.S. \u00a748304).\nThe Borough\u2019s zoning ordinance went into effect in 1935 and has been amended several times. Since June 1, 1946, the land which the Authority purchased in 1949 and upon which it seeks to erect the water tank has been in a district where such water tanks are prohibited.\nSection 3307 of The Borough Code, as amended, provides: \u201c(a) The council may appoint a board of adjustment, and in regulations and restrictions adopted pursuant to the authority of this article may provide that said board of adjustment may in appropriate cases, and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, make special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance in harmony with its general purpose and intent and in accordance with general or specific rules therein contained.\n\u201c(g) the board of adjustment shall have the following powers: ... (3) To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the imblie interest, where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done.\u201d (53 P.S. \u00a748307).\nSection 3307 of The Borough Code, as amended, provides: \u201c(i) Any person aggrieved by any decision of the board of adjustment, or any taxpayer or any officer of the borough, may within thirty days after such decision of the board appeal to the court of common pleas of the county by petition, duly verified, setting forth that such decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law and specifying the grounds upon which he relies.\n\u201c(j) [provides for certification of record from board to court]\n\u201c(I) If upon the hearing of the appeal it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the proper disposition of the appeal, it may take evidence or appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to the court, with his findings of facts and conclusions of law. The court may reverse, or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the decision appealed from as to it may appear just and proper.\u201d (58 P.S. \u00a748307).\nSee footnote 4, supra.\nAct of May 2, 1945, P.

Cf. the corresponding provision of the Third Class City Code: \u201cThe Public Utility Commission, upon petition of a public utility company and after a public hearing, may determine that a building, structure or use of the company, present or proposed, which is or would be violative of the zoning ordinance, is reasonably necessary to the welfare of the public; and in such case the zoning ordinance shall not apply to the building structure or use in question.\u201d Act of June 23, 1931, P.
