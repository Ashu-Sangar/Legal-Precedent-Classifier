{"id": "878675", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe are not aware of any statute that gives a right of appeal from an order refusing to strike off an appeal from arbitrators. None has been brought to our attention. The order is interlocutory. The cause is still pending and may be brought to trial at the will of either party. For this reason the appeal is dismissed."}
