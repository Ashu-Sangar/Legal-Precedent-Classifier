{"id": "490981", "contents": "The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered November 17th 1879,\nPer Curiam.\nThis case is not distinguishable from Mulherrin v. Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co., 31 P. F. Smith 366. The side track here, though upon the property of the plaintiff\u2019s employee, was nevertheless used by the defendant and by his license. The plaintiff below was therefore employed on or about the defendant\u2019s road, and within the very terms of the Act of 1868.\nJudgment affirmed."}
