The issues are:\n(1) Did [the] Commonwealth Court contravene United States Supreme Court precedent by limiting forfeitures to instrumentalities of the underlying offense?\n(2) Did the Commonwealth Court contravene this Court\u2019s and United States Supreme Court\u2019s precedent by adopting a subjective test, including criminal culpability, for an excessive fine that is unworkable and illogical?\n(3) Did the Commonwealth Court act beyond its authority and contravene this Court\u2019s precedent and the Forfeiture Act by holding that an innocent owner defense is proven even where the owner knew of drug sales from her property by her adult son and did nothing to stop them?"}
