{"id": "989742", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe question of jurisdiction, presented by this appeal from the decree of the court below sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill at plaintiff\u2019s costs, appears to have been carefully considered and correctly decided. We have no doubt as to tlie correctness of the conclusion reached by the learned president of the common pleas, and finding nothing in the record that requires special notice the decree is affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
