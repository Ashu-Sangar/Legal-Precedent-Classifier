{"id": "1761083", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nO\u2019BRIEN, Justice.\nOn August 11,1974, at approximately 9:55 p. m., appellant Marvin L. Wolbach was operating a truck on Legislative Route 08081 in Athens Township, Bradford County. He pulled off the road to help a friend, Gary Miller, who was having trouble starting his car. He parked in front of a car owned by appellee John A. Fay. While Wolbach was standing between his truck and Fay\u2019s car, a car driven by appellee Caroline Barber struck Fay\u2019s car, which in turn struck Wolbach, seriously injuring him.\nWolbach and his wife, Esther Wolbach, also appellant herein, sued Fay in the Court of Common Pleas of Bradford County. They alleged he was negligent in leaving his car unattended, without parking lights or flashers. They also sued James P. Calhoun and Madelyn C. Calhoun, his wife, appellees herein and owners of the property in front of which the vehicles were parked. The Calhouns operate a farm market on the property. Appellants alleged they were negligent in failing to provide adequate parking and lighting, making it necessary for the vehicles to park partly on the road. Fay joined Caroline Barber and her husband, William G. Barber, as additional defendants.\nBefore filing suit, at the request of an agent of the Barbers\u2019 insurer, Marvin Wolbach signed a release which stated that in consideration of the payment of $10,000, Wolbach released the Barbers from all claims and:\n\u201cFurther release[d] any and all persons or entities, whether named herein or otherwise, who may be jointly or severally liable in tort for all known or unknown personal injuries, death, or property damage in any way arising out of or resulting from or to result from the [accident].\u201d\nThe court of common pleas held the release barred recovery from any defendant. It granted a defense motion for summary judgment. The Superior Court affirmed per curiam without an opinion. We granted a petition for allowance of appeal.\nThe issue before us is whether it was proper to enter summary judgment. Rule of Civil Procedure 1035(b) provides that summary judgment may be entered if on \u201cthe pleading, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions of file, together with the affidavits, if any . there is no genuine issue as to any material fact . . . .\u201d Appellants claim there was an issue as to whether the release was valid as applied to the defendants other than the Barbers. The effect of a release must be determined from the ordinary meaning of its language. Estate of Bodnar, 472 Pa. 383, 372 A.2d 746 (1977). In Hasselrode v. Gnagey, 404 Pa. 549, 172 A.2d 764 (1961), a release given to a particular individual and \u201cany and all other persons . whether herein named or not\u201d was held to be applicable to all tort feasors despite the fact they were not specifically named. Reformation of the release would require a showing of fraud or mutual mistake by clear, precise, and convincing evidence. Yoo Hoo Bottling Co. of Pa., Inc. v. Leibowitz, 432 Pa. 117, 247 A.2d 469 (1968).\nAppellants contend the release was procured by fraud, that Marvin Wolbach did not know he was releasing anyone other than the Barbers, and that he did not contemplate doing so. The alleged fraud consisted of the failure of the insurance agent to fully explain the effect of the release. However, Wolbach admitted in a deposition that the release was in clear language, that he read it, and that he understood the meaning of the words. Since there is no allegation of actual misrepresentation and appellant had an opportunity to read the release and admitted he understood it, we find there was no fraud. Appellant\u2019s admissions cast doubt on the allegation of lack of knowledge or contemplation of the release of all parties. If the allegation were accepted, it would establish only a unilateral and not a mutual mistake. The facts as alleged by appellants provide no basis for setting aside the release. It was proper to enter summary judgment.\nThe order of the Superior Court is affirmed.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion which FLAHERTY, J., joins."}
