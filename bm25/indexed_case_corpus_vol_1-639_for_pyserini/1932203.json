{"id": "1932203", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nOn August 8, 1967, a soda pop bottle allegedly exploded in appellant\u2019s grocery store, causing appellant the loss of his right eye. Suit was instituted against appellee, Philadelphia Coca Cola Bottling Company, on November 8, 1968. On February 14, 1969, appellant filed interrogatories on appellee, the interrogatories noting that an answer was required to be filed within twenty days. See Pa. R. C. P. 4006. On April 11, 1969, appellant, not having yet received appellee\u2019s answers, wrote a letter to counsel for appellee requesting the answers and advising appellee that a motion for sanctions would be filed if tbe answers were not submitted by April 18. No answers were received and appellant filed Ms motion on April 24.\nOn May 20 the court, per Judge Barbieri, ordered appellee to file answers within thirty days. The order further provided that if the answers were not filed witMn that time, appellant could, by filing a praecipe, enter judgment against appellant. On June 16, four days before the answers were due, counsel for appellant and appellee engaged in a telephone conversation in which, among other things, appellant again requested the answers. Counsel for appellee stated that the in-' terrogatories were out to the client for answer. No answers were filed on the June 20 deadline.\nOn June 27 counsel for appellant again wrote counsel for appellee requesting the answers. On July 8 counsel for appellant attempted to contact counsel for appellee by telephone; the latter never returned the call. On July 10\u2014twenty days after the due date specified in Judge BarbierCs order, and almost four months after the date the answers were originally due\u2014 appellant entered judgment against appellee.\nOn August 1 appellee filed a petition to open the judgment, alleging basically, that it had been confused by counsel for appellant and believed that counsel was not serious about enforcing Judge Barbieri\u2019s order. Additionally, appellee alleged that it had \u201ca valid defense\u201d to appellant\u2019s claim. The court granted the petition to open. This appeal followed and we reverse.\nIt is well settled that a petition to open a judgment is an appeal to the court\u2019s discretion, and that this discretion may properly be exercised to grant such a petition if: 1) the petition is promptly filed; 2) a defense is shown to exist on the merits; and 8) the default is reasonably explained or excused. Fox v. Mellon, 438 Pa. 364, 264 A. 2d 623 (1970) (citing cases) ; Kramer v. Philadelphia, 425 Pa. 472, 229 A. 2d 875 (1967) ; Wheel v. Park Building, 412 Pa. 545, 195 A. 2d 359 (1963) (citing cases).\nWe do not believe that the default in the instant case was \u201creasonably explained.\u201d Judge Bakbieri\u2019s order, and appellant\u2019s several requests, clearly indicated appellant\u2019s desire for answers to the interrogatories. This is not a case where appellant lulled appellee into a false sense of security, see Good v. Sworob, 420 Pa. 435, 218 A. 2d 240 (1966). Nor is this a case where appellant made a \u201cstudied attempt\u201d to obtain a default judgment, see Fox v. Mellon, supra. Appellant carefully, and explicitly, preserved his rights. He certainly cannot be foreclosed from exercising them simply because he was courteous and extended the time limits. See Kramer v. Philadelphia, 425 Pa. at 477, 229 A. 2d at 877.\nAs this Court stated in McDonald v. Allen, 416 Pa. 397, 400, 206 A. 2d 395, 396 (1965) : \u201c'\u201cThe exercise of generosity does not create a binding obligation for its continuance.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Appellee knew of Judge Barbieri\u2019s order and does not now complain that it was an improper one under the circumstances. He cannot be heard to say that he did not think appellant was serious in his desire to enforce his rights.\nThe order of the Court of Common Pleas, Trial Division, of Philadelphia is reversed.\nThe interrogatories were as follows: \u201c1. State the name and address of the truck driver who last made a delivery of Coca-Cola to Triolo Brothers at 1604 Morris Street before August 7, 1967. (a) State the date said delivery was made, (b) State the number of cases of Coca-cola that were delivered on said day. 2. Did the driver named in the answer to interrogatory No. 1 make the delivery alone or did he have help? (a) If he had help, please give the name, address and job designation of the helper of said driver above named. 3. State the exact place the Coca-Cola was delivered on the date given in answer to interrogatory No. 2. 4. State if your driver and/or helper delivered the Coca-Cola into the store of Triolo Brothers or warehouse of Triolo Brothers or if 'this was a curb delivery and said Coca-Cola was then handled by an employee of Triolo Brothers.\u201d\nSpecifically appellee alleged: \u201cIn various conversations both before and after May 20, 1969, between counsel for the parties, counsel for your petitioner was led to believe that the motion for sanctions had been filed because plaintiff\u2019s counsel was filing two other motions for sanctions (in other cases) against the firm representing defendant and that as a matter of convenience the motion in question was filed at the same time, that the answers to the interrogatories were of no great importance to plaintiff, and that no action adverse to the interests of defendant would be taken without counsel for defendant having adequate Wanning thereof.\u201d Appellee made no allegation that the answers were not forthcoming because of the nature of the questions asked, or. be? cause of any difficulty in securing the answers.\n. The trial court stated that \u201c[a]t best, it can be said that there was confusion between the attorneys. Such confusions [sic] misled defendant\u2019s counsel and is accepted as a reasonable explanation for the delay in filing answers.\u201d"}
