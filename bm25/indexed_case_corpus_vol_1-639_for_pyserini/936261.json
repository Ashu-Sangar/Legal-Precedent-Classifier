{"id": "936261", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe only question involved in this appeal is whether a stranger not a party to a suit, and having no interest in it beyond that of any other citizen, can interpose to take it out of the hands of the responsible parties to the record and conduct further proceedings according to his own views. No authority has been shown for any such extraordinary and irregular action.\nJudgment affirmed."}
