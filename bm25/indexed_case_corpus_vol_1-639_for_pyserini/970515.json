{"id": "970515", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nThere was no error in refusing to surcharge the accountant with the amount of principal alleged to have been lost by the investment in United States bonds at a premium, which were subsequently called in and paid off at par. For reasons given at length in the opinion of the learned auditing judge, Pen-rose, J., the Orphans\u2019 Court was clearly right in dismissing the exceptions, and confirming his adjudication.\nDecree affirmed, and appeal dismissed, at the cost of appellant."}
