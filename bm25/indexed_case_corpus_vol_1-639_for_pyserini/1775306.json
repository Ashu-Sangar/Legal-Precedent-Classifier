{"id": "1775306", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nThis is a survival action. The sole issue is whether the trial court properly instructed the jury on the \u201cpersonal maintenance\u201d deduction. A panel of the Superior Court was of the view that a new trial is necessary because the instruction unduly limited the scope of items includible within the deduction to \u201csubsistence level expenses.\u201d We hold that on the present record the court\u2019s charge does not require a new trial. Hence we vacate the order of the Superior Court, 285 Pa.Super. 271, 427 A.2d 218, and remand for further proceedings.\nI\nAppellants\u2019 decedents Robert McClinton (age 16) and Dino Toney (age 18) were passengers in a vehicle being driven by appellee\u2019s decedent James McClinton. The vehicle struck another vehicle being driven by Lee Smith. Smith survived the accident, but all of the others were killed instantly. Appellants commenced the present action against appellee and Smith. In the liability phase of trial, a jury held only appellee liable.\nIn the phase of the trial relating to damages, appellants sought recovery for the lost earnings of the decedents. After presenting evidence on the interests, talents, and ambitions of their decedents, appellants presented the testimony of Dr. Reuben Slesinger, Professor of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh. Utilizing statistics on average incomes complied by the United States Department of Commerce and tables on work-life expectancies compiled by the United States Department of Labor, Dr. Slesinger calculated the decedents\u2019 earning potential both as college graduates and as high school graduates.\nFrom the gross earning potential of the decedents Dr. Slesinger subtracted 35% of the computed sums to reflect a deduction for his estimates of \u201cpersonal maintenance.\u201d This deduction was based on the assumption that both of the decedents would marry and become members of a four-person \u201cmodel\u201d family. The 35% figure, derived from United States Department of Labor statistics, reflected the individual share of the model family\u2019s budget of a person under thirty-five years of age. Dr. Slesinger applied the 35% figure to all years of the decedent\u2019s work-life expectancy. Personal maintenance included expenditures for \u201cfood, clothing, things of this type.\u201d\nDr. Slesinger subtracted an additional 3.5% of decedents\u2019 gross earning potential to reflect \u201cpersonal absences.\u201d This deduction was based on a recently released study which had concluded that \u201cpeople throughout a work year tend to take off about nine days, ... or about three-and-a-half percent of their work year . .. . \u201d According to Dr. Slesinger,\n\u201c[t]his is not your vacation where you are paid. It is not sickness where you are paid. It is just you don\u2019t show up for work. Maybe they want to go hunting, or maybe they just don\u2019t feel like going to work that day. Now, that three-and-a-half percent is a deduction of earnings, and really it does not affect your earning power. The earning power is there, and the fact that you take off a few days does not affect earning power. But, in order to be a little more conservative, I did deduct it anyway.\u201d\nAfter making this deduction, Dr. Slesinger reduced the net earning potential to present worth.\nDr. Slesinger\u2019s analysis yielded the following estimates:\nMcClinton (agei6) College High School TONEY (age 18) College High School\nGross Earning Potential $772,242 $551,709 $772,242 $543,394\nLess:\nPersonal Maintenance (35% of Gross) (270,285) (193,099) (270,285) (190,188)\nPersonal Absences (3.5% of Gross) (27,029) (19,310) (27,029) (19,019)\nNet Earning Potential $474,928 $339,300 $474,928 $334,187\nPresent Worth (at 6%) $211,962 $159,842 $218,383 $159,967.\nAlthough appellee cross-examined Dr. Slesinger on the assumptions underlying his methodology, appellee offered no evidence to dispute the reasonableness of Dr. Slesinger\u2019s deductions from gross earning potential.\nIn its charge to the jury, the court directed the jury to deduct from each decedent\u2019s gross earning potential \u201cthe probable cost of his necessary, economic living expenses and personal maintenance, those expenses required to sustain his life until the day of his retirement . In defining \u201cprobable cost of maintenance,\u201d the court stated:\n\u201c[Personal maintenance] is that figure or that amount of money that you estimate or determine he would have spent on himself individually, personally, not what he might have spent on a wife, not what he might have spent on children, not what he might have spent on parents or relatives or friends, not what he might have given away as gifts, but what he would have spent to provide himself with the necessities of life; that is, what he would have spent to sustain his life, to subsist and to live on. In other words, what he would have spent for those things which are essential to the individual\u2019s personal and physical subsistence. That cost, of course, what that cost or personal maintenance would be is for you to judge and for you to determine on the basis of the evidence you have heard and exercising and using your combined life\u2019s experience and combining and pooling your common sense, and applying those matters to the evidence and testimony and deciding what each of these young men, in all probability or more likely than not, would have spent for their own personal or individual maintenance.\u201d\nAppellee unsuccessfully objected to the charge on the theory that \u201cpersonal maintenance\u201d includes \u201cthe amount which the person spends on [himself],\u201d and not merely expenditures \u201cfor essentials or necessities only.\u201d The jury returned identical verdicts of $170,000 in favor of each of the appellants. These amounts were less than those calculated by Dr. Slesinger on the assumption that decedents would have graduated from college, but more than those calculated on the assumption of their graduation from high school only.\nII\nAlthough offered as a definition of \u201cpersonal maintenance,\u201d appellee\u2019s proposed modification of the court\u2019s charge to require a deduction for \u201cthe amount which the person spends on [himself]\u201d would have limited appellants\u2019 recovery to the difference between decedents\u2019 gross earnings and their total personal expenditures. This difference, termed \u201cnet accumulations,\u201d understates the proper measure of lost earnings under the law of this Commonwealth. As this Court observed four decades ago,\n\u201c[a]s to the . . . viewpoint . . . that the amount recoverable should have been limited to the probable accumulations by the deceased during his life expectancy \u2014 that is to say, to the present worth of what he would probably have left at the end of his life to his creditors, legatees and heirs \u2014 this would introduce into the law of damages elements never heretofore recognized in Pennsylvania\nPezzulli v. D\u2019Ambrosia, 344 Pa. 643, 649, 26 A.2d 659, 662 (1942). Accordingly, appellee\u2019s proposed modification of the ch\u00e1rge was properly rejected by the trial court.\nAlthough the panel of the Superior Court rejected appellee\u2019s view that the trial court had erred in refusing to charge that appellants could recover only their decedents\u2019 net accumulations, it did accept appellee\u2019s contention that the charge was \u201coverly restrictive\u201d and \u201cprovided the.jury with an incorrect standard for determining damages.\u201d According to the Superior Court, \u201c[c]learly, the trial court\u2019s description of the maintenance expense deduction in terms of physical subsistence was error.\u201d In setting forth its view of the expenses that should be included in the deduction, the Superior Court chose to view the decedent \u201cas an economic unit capable of producing earnings, but subject to the costs of production.\u201d As examples of \u201ctypical\u201d production costs, the Superior Court cited with approval the analysis of the term \u201ccost of maintenance\u201d contained in Bernstein, \u201cDamages in Personal Injury and Death Cases in Pennsylvania (A Supplement),\u201d 26 Pa.Bar.Ass\u2019n Q. 26 (1954).\nWe do not disagree with the Superior Court\u2019s economic-unit analysis, or its approval of the analysis of \u201ccost of maintenance\u201d set forth by Mr. Bernstein. Under the latter analysis, cost of maintenance is\n\u201cthat necessary and economical sum which a decedent would be expected to spend, based upon his station in life, for food, clothing, shelter, medical attention and some recreation.\u201d\nBernstein, supra, at 34 (footnote omitted). We emphasize only that, for the sake both of clarity and the parties\u2019 presentation of proof, a jury should be charged in specific, readily understandable terms such as those just quoted. We do, however, disagree with the conclusion of the Superior Court that the trial court\u2019s charge requires a new trial.\nThe trial court\u2019s use of the phrases \u201cto sustain . . . life,\u201d \u201cto subsist [on],\u201d and \u201csubsistence\u201d may not have been the most ideal manner of expressing the deduction for maintenance required by our case law. See Incollingo v. Ewing, 444 Pa. 299, 282 A.2d 206 (1971), and Murray v. Philadelphia Transportation Co., 359 Pa. 69, 58 A.2d 323 (1948). Viewed in isolation, these terms are capable of conveying the impression that the deduction encompasses only those expenditures essential to the barest survival. In disregard of the mandate of our case law, a deduction limited to expenditures for the barest survival would, in reality, approach no deduction at all.\nHere, however, appellants\u2019 own expert witness specifically deducted two sums from the decedents\u2019 gross earning potential: \u201cpersonal maintenance\u201d and \u201cpersonal absences.\u201d Although the expert witness\u2019s formulation of the first deduction for \u201cpersonal maintenance\u201d was limited to reasonable expenditures for food, clothing, and \u201cthings of this type,\u201d the second deduction for \u201cpersonal absences\u201d was described to take into account such likely factors as the decedent\u2019s desire \u201cto go hunting\u201d or his lack of desire to \u201c[go] to work that day.\u201d Appellee offered no evidence to refute the propriety of the scope of either of these deductions.\nThe first deduction for \u201cfood, clothing, things of this type\u201d reflected a significant range of expenditures for maintenance. The leisure activities contemplated by the second deduction for personal absences also make positive contributions to maintenance. Earnings which are forgone for the sake of such days are as much expenditures for leisure activities as are monies directly spent on the same activities.\nDespite the potential for misimpression inherent in the phrases employed by the trial court, the expert\u2019s deductions for \u201cpersonal maintenance\u201d and \u201cpersonal absences\u201d rendered the likelihood of misimpression negligible. When instructed by the court to subtract from gross earning potential those sums that the decedent \u201cwould have spent to sustain his life, to subsist and to live on,\u201d or, as the court also stated, \u201cthose things which are essential to the individual\u2019s personal and physical subsistence,\u201d this jury was directed to consider all items included in the expert\u2019s deductions. As \u201cfood, clothing, things of this type,\u201d and leisure activities properly reflect the items of expense within the maintenance deduction, see Bernstein, supra, we conclude that the court\u2019s charge provided a proper guiding compass for the evaluation of the evidence on the maintenance deduction. Hence, the Superior Court incorrectly deemed the court\u2019s charge reversible error.\nThe record indicates that, in view of its disposition, the Superior Court had no occasion to pass upon other assignments of error which had been presented by appellee. These other assignments are not now before us. Thus, fair and effective appellate review requires the vacation of the order of the Superior Court and a remand of the record to that court for disposition of appellee\u2019s remaining assignments of error.\nOrder of the Superior Court vacated and case remanded.\n. Record at 140a.\n. Record at 141a.\n. Trial was held before this Court\u2019s decision in Kaczkowski v. Bolubasz, 491 Pa. 561, 421 A.2d 1027 (1980) (courts \u201cinstructed to abandon the practice of discounting lost future earnings\u201d).\n. The net earning potential of the decedents is the same where it is assumed that both would have completed college. However, the present worth of Toney\u2019s net earning potential is larger than McClinton\u2019s because Toney would have completed college (and hence entered the job market) before McClinton. The difference in gross earning potential where it is assumed that both would have completed high school only is attributable to the differences in the decedents\u2019 ages and work-life expectancies.\n. Record at 229a.\n. Record at 230-3la.\n. See Martin, \u201cMeasuring Damages in Survival Actions for Tortious Death,\u201d 47 Wash.L.Rev. 609, 620 (1972).\n. We recognize that, in rejecting the accumulations standard, Pezzulli stated that there should be no deduction from gross earnings. However, this statement was dictum, as the plaintiff had expressed satisfaction with the trial court\u2019s charge directing the jury to deduct the cost of maintenance from gross earnings. 344 Pa. at 646 & 649, 26 A.2d at 660 & 662. In any event, the dictum in Pezzulli was repudiated by this Court in Murray v. Philadelphia Transportation Co., 359 Pa. 69, 58 A.2d 323 (1948), where the \u201ccost of maintenance\u201d deduction was approved. See also Incollingo v. Ewing, 444 Pa. 299, 282 A.2d 206 (1971)."}
