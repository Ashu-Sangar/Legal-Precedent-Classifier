{"id": "970628", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nWe find no error in this record. If the evidence, the rejection of which is assigned for error, was admissible, which is by no means clear, the defendant below does not appear to have been injured by its rejection, as nearly all that is covered by the exceptions was subsequently admitted, and went to the jury. There is nothing in the case which requires discussion.\nJudgment affirmed."}
