{"id": "1187924", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThis is an appeal from a judgment on a writ of attachment execution directed against a devise in a will in the hands of the executor and trustee.\nThe facts are: On October 27, 1937, the Overbrook Heights Building & Loan Association, successor to and merged with the Ernest Building & Loan Association, the plaintiff-appellee (hereinafter referred to as the association), entered a judgment upon a bond and warrant of attorney against Edgar M. Wilson. On the same day, it caused to be issued a writ of attachment execution directed against the devise under the will to the defendant, Edgar M. Wilson, in the hands of Alexander Wilson, Jr., Executor and Trustee under the will of Alexander Wilson, deceased. On November 26, following, interrogatories to the garnishee were filed. On November 29, the defendant by petition requested the court to dissolve the attachment, and, on April 8, 1938, the court refused to do so. The garnishee then filed his answer to the interrogatories averring that the defendant \u201chas no interest\u201d in the Estate of Alexander Wilson, deceased, \u201cother than an interest in the event that the defendant should survive the trustee.\u201d Upon the an-SAvers, the association asked for a rule for judgment against the garnishee. On July 22, an answer was filed to this rule by the garnishee, incorporating a copy of the will of the decedent and averring that \u201cEdgar M. Wilson, the defendant, is not entitled to anything, nor is there at the present time anything due him, nor will he ever receive anything until a contingency happens, to wit, he outlives or survives his father. (See paragraph eight of the will attached which provides, inter alia, \u2018Upon the death of any of my said children leaving issuing surviving.\u2019)\u201d On the same day the garnishee filed his petition asking that the writ of attachment execution be dissolved because the interest of the defendant in the Estate of Alexander Wilson, deceased, \u201cis purely contingent and is not subject to attachment.\u201d To the latter, the execution plaintiff filed an answer, averring that \u201cEdgar M. Wilson has an interest\u201d in the estate aforementioned, which is \u201ca vested interest subject to divestiture in the event of the defendant\u2019s death.\u201d Such an interest is subject to attachment. Both rules were then argued before the court in banc and by formal opinion the garnishee\u2019s rule to dissolve the attachment was dismissed, and the association\u2019s rule for judgment was sustained and judgment accordingly entered against the garnishee as follows: \u201cOctober 21, 1938 \u2014 Judgment entered in favor of the Plaintiff and against the Garnishee, Alexander Wilson, Jr., Executor and Trustee u/w of Alexander Wilson, dec\u2019d. Eo die: Damages assessed at $10,500.90 [includes $9,917.42 principal and $583.48 interest].\u201d This appeal followed.\nThe question Ave have to decide here is whether the defendant\u2019s interest under paragraph eight of the decedent\u2019s will is a vested or a contingent one. If it is the former, it is the subject of an attachment execution; otherwise, it is not. This court so held in Patterson v. Caldwell, 124 Pa. 455, 461, 17 A. 18, where we said: \u201cAn attachment execution reaches effects and interests that cannot be taken on a writ of fieri facias, but it is execution process and its office is to appropriate the property of the defendant to the judgment which supports it. That which has a present and certain existence although its possession and enjoyment may be postponed for a time, may be seized by it, but it cannot grasp expectancies or contingent interests.\u201d See also Butler County Nat. Bk. v. MacMullen et al., 292 Pa. 556, 141 A. 484.\nParagraph 8 of the will in question provides as follows : \u201cI give and bequeath to my executors and trustees hereinafter named, all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate, real, personal, and mixed whatsoever and wheresoever, in trust, to collect the rents, interest and income and profits thereof and pay over the same monthly unto my following named nine children, to wit: . . ., Alexander \"Wilson, . . ., in equal shares for and during all the terms of their natural lives. Such rent, interest, income and profits, in no event to be in any way liable for the debts, liabilities, contracts or engagements of any of my said children, but in all cases to be paid to them, and in case of my daughters to be paid to them individually notwithstanding their coverture. Should any of my said children die unmarried, or without issue, I give, devise and bequeath his or her share of my estate of which he or she had received the income, to such of my said nine children above named as shall then be surviving for and during the term of their natural lives, and to the issue of such of my said children as may then be deceased, such issue of said deceased child or children however to take absolutely the share or portion of my estate which their parent would take for and during the term of his or her natural life under this item of my will had he or she been living. Upon the death of any of my said children leaving issue surviving I give, devise and bequeath unto such issue absolutely that portion or share of my estate which my said deceased child had received the income for life in the proportions in which it would be distributed to such issue under the Intestate Laws of the .Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Should such issue be minors I constitute and appoint my Executors and Trustees Guardians and Trustees of the Estate of such minors. Such Guardianship or Trusteeship in case of female to continue until she reaches the age of twenty-five years.\u201d\nDefendant, Edgar M. Wilson, is the child of Alexander Wilson, Jr., one of the children of the testator and the executor and trustee under the will. Upon the death of Alexander Wilson, Jr., if the defendant is then living, he will receive the principal of \u201cthe portion or share of the estate\u201d on which his father had received the income for life \u201cin the proportions in which it would be distributed to such issue under the Intestate Laws of the Commonwealth.\u201d The garnishee, Alexander Wilson, Jr., who is the father referred to, in paragraph seven of his answer to the plaintiff\u2019s rule to show cause why judgment should not be entered against him as garnishee, recognizes that his estate is only that of a \u201clife tenant.\u201d The remainder over goes to his issue \u201cupon the death\u201d of this life tenant. The interest of the defendant, the issue in being of the class of which he is a member, may be decreased or enlarged by future issue or by the death of some of the living issue in the same class, but this does not make his estate a contingent one. The interest clearly vested at testator\u2019s death. We so held on a similar state of facts in Lloyd\u2019s Estate, 326 Pa. 230, 192 A. 98. There the clause in question passed all the testator\u2019s estate to a trustee in trust to \u201cpay over the net income thereof unto my beloved wife . . ., for and during the term of her natural life, . . . and at and after the decease of said wife, then in trust to be equally divided between my children and the issue of any deceased child as they respectively arrive at the age of twenty-one years, share and share alike, absolutely and in fee, but so, however, that the issue of any such deceased child shall stand in the place of and only take the same share which said decedent would have taken, if living, the income of said respective shares to be paid to said children, or grandchildren, if any, during their respective minorities.\u201d Testator\u2019s son John died after having attained the age of twenty-one, during the lifetime of testator\u2019s widow. He died without issue. Testator\u2019s other son William survived. John had assigned his interest in the estate to certain hanking institutions as collateral security for loans made to him. After the death of the life tenant, these hanking institutions made claim to one-half of the net estate on the ground that John had a vested interest under his father\u2019s will. William claimed that as a result of the death of John before the death of his mother, the entire estate vested in him, William. The orphans\u2019 court awarded one-half of the fund for distribution to the banking institutions, holding that John\u2019s share had vested. Upon appeal, this decree was affirmed. In that case this court, speaking through' Mr. Justice Schaffer, quoted with approval the following from the opinion of Judge Gest of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia, in Buckman\u2019s Est., 13 D. & C. 653, 655: \u201c. . . What substantial difference is there between a devise after life estate to the testator\u2019s children (which is clearly vested) and a direction that the estate should be divided among them.\u201d As long ago as McClure\u2019s Appeal, 72 Pa. 414, it has been pointed out: \u201cThough there be no other gift than in the direction to pay or distribute in futuro, yet if such gift or distribution appears to be postponed for the convenience of the fund or property, or where the gift is only postponed to let in some other interest, the vesting will not be deferred till the period in question.\u201d\nThe basic error in appellant\u2019s reasoning is found in the following excerpt from his brief: \u201cIt has clearly been shown by the terms of the will that the grandson of the testator, to wit, Edgar M. Wilson, unless he survives his father, the present Trustee and Garnishee, will receive nothing. It is a prior contingency that he must fulfill, to wit, he must outlive the trustee.\u201d The contingency which makes a devise \u201ccontingent\u201d is never the contingency that the devisee in order to enjoy the devise must outlive the life tenant who possesses the prior right of enjoyment. (McClure\u2019s Appeal, supra.) In the \u201cRestatement of Property,\u201d Vol. 2, p. 561, sec. 157, under the caption \u201cComment on Clause (d)\u201d appears the following : \u201cRemainder subject to a condition precedent \u2014 Uncertainties. When a limitation creates a remainder and it is not possible to point to any person and to say such person would take, if all interests including a prior right to a present interest should now end, this remainder is subject to a condition precedent. This uncertainty distinguishes this type of remainder from those vested subject to open and from those vested subject to complete defeasance. Sometimes the uncertainty proceeds from the necessity, under the terms of the limitation, for some stated event to occur before a known person could have a certainty of future enjoyment. Sometimes the uncertainty is still more pervasive, in that the fulfillment of the condition precedent must occur before any person Avill exist Avho could take the remainder interest.\u201d In the same volume of the Restatement, p. 551, sec. 157, under \u201cComment on Clause (b),\u201d appears the following: \u201cRemainders vested subject to open \u2014 Certainty of enjoyment of some share. When a remainder is vested subject to open, it is possible to point to a person and to say that such person would take, if all interests including a prior right to-enjoyment of the thing should now end. Furthermore, this person is certain to acquire a present interest in some part of the affected thing at some time in the future, and is also certain to be entitled to retain permanently thereafter the present interest so acquired. . . . \u201d It is clear to us that Edgar M. Wilson, the defendant, is such a person. In deciding questions of this character, the fact that a devisee\u2019s enjoyment of the interest that has legally vested in him may be frustrated by his death is of no materiality. When it is stated that \u201cthis person is certain to acquire a present interest\" in some part of the' affected thing at some time in the future,\u201d the statement is based on the presumption that he will live until that \u201cfuture.\u201d\nThe contingency that makes a devise contingent is well illustrated in the case cited by appellant with the following comment by him: \u201cThe meaning of the word \u2018interest\u2019 in the attachment act is put beyond doubt by the interpretation of the court in Keene\u2019s Appeal, 60 Pa. 504.\u201d In that case, as Justice Agnew pointed out, the interest of the appellant in the estate in question was \u201ca bare possibility, dependent on the death of Ellen K. Mitchell without issue, and even after that comes the question of survivorship between Henry and James, to be decided before any part can reach the children of James Keene, of whom the petitioner is one.\u201d Justice Agnew, speaking for this court, declared: \u201cHe [the appellant] has no present interest, immediate or remote\u201d in the estate.\nIn Wheaton Coal Co. v. Harris et al., 288 Pa. 294, 135 A. 637, it appeared that decedent died leaving a will in which he gave his residuary estate in trust for his wife for life and directed that on her death the property should \u201cbe divided into as many shares as there shall be grandchildren living at the time of my death.\u201d He also provided that his son should take the same share as each of the grandchildren and that should his son predecease testator\u2019s wife, then the son\u2019s share should lapse and become a part of the residuary estate. The son and his two adult sons became indebted to plaintiff and in order to secure payment of that indebtedness issued a writ of foreign attachment against their interests under the will of the decedent, having first obtained judgment against defendants, and summoned the trustee, appellant, and others, as garnishees. The validity of the attachment was questioned and as this court said: \u201cWhether it is or is not valid depends upon the nature of the interests of the son and grandchildren in the estate of William H. Harris, are they vested or contingent?\u201d The court below held them vested and subject to attachment but withheld execution during the life of the widow. The trustee appealed. This court, in an opinion by Justice Frazer, said: \u201cIt is a well-settled rule, repeated in numerous cases, that the tests in determining if an interest is vested or contingent, is not the certainty or uncertainty of obtaining actual possession, nor the defeasibility or indefeasibility of the right of possession, inasmuch as estates may be vested in interest though without present right of possession. So long as a present right exists to a future possession the estate is vested, even though actual possession may be defeated by a future event. In Walker\u2019s Est., 277 Pa. 444, 448 [121 A. 318], quoting from Fearne on Contingent Remainders, and following earlier decisions of this court, we said: \u2018Wherever there is a particular estate, the determination of which does not depend on any uncertain event, and a remainder is thereon absolutely limited to a person in esse and ascertained, although the nature and duration of the estate limited in the remainder may be such that it may not endure beyond the particular estate, and may therefore never take effect or vest in possession, it is not a contingent, but a vested remainder.\u2019 In McCauley\u2019s Est., 257 Pa. 377, 381 [101 A. 827], we stated the rule to be that \u2018Where a legacy is made payable at a future time, certain to arrive, and not subject to condition precedent, it is vested where there is a person in esse at the time of the testator\u2019s death capable of taking when the time arrives, although his interest be liable to be defeated altogether by his own death.\u2019 \u201d This court then said: \u201cThe gift to the son is absolute after the termination of the life estate in testator\u2019s wife, subject only to the provision that in case he should die before the life tenant, his share shall become an additional part of the residue devised to the grandchildren. This was clearly a present vested right to a future possession, and the fact that it was subject to be defeated by his death, before the death of the life tenant, did not make the gift contingent. There was a present capacity to take possession, if the possession should become vacant, and the right of enjoyment vested immediately, subject only to be divested on tbe happening of tbe event indicated.\u201d In that case tbe court below held tbe interest of tbe son and grandsons to be vested, sustained tbe attachment as valid, and directed that judgment \u201cbe entered in favor of tbe plaintiff and against tbe garnishee . . ., trustee under tbe will of William H. Harris, but not individually or personally, in tbe sum of $11,476.90, with costs and interest from December 10,1925, provided so much shall eventually be found in tbe bands of tbe garnishee and due tbe defendants as their shares or interests under tbe will of William H. Harris, deceased, upon the death of tbe widow, or any other event, subject, however, as to tbe share or interest of George H. Harris to bis assignment to tbe Burlington County Safe Deposit and Trust Company.\u201d This court affirmed that judgment.\nIn Ellwanger v. Moore, 206 Pa. 234, 55 A. 966, this court, in a case similar to tbe one at bar, said: \u201cTbe effect of an attachment is to transfer to tbe attaching creditor tbe rights of tbe defendant in tbe decedent\u2019s estate: Lorenz v. King, 38 Pa. 93. \u2018The attachment of this legacy,\u2019 says Lowrie, C. J., in Strong\u2019s Executors v. Bass, 35 Pa. 333, . . . \u2018only transfers to tbe plaintiffs tbe responsibility which before was due to tbe legatee. ... It merely substitutes tbe legatee\u2019s creditor instead of tbe legatee himself.\u2019 . . . Tbe attachment execution in this case bad accomplished its purpose as declared by tbe statute when tbe judgment was entered against tbe garnishees. Tbe attaching expeditor then stood in tbe shoes of bis debtor and was armed with tbe necessary authority to demand and receive of tbe executors and trustees whatever interest the debtor might have as a distributee of bis father\u2019s estate. No fieri facias or other writ of execution was required to invest the plaintiffs with tbe rights of tbe debtor in tbe decedent\u2019s estate. Such a writ, therefore, was not necessary to carry into effect tbe purpose of tbe attachment and to make it available to tbe creditor. Tbe position of the appellees would have force and would be correct if the attachment had been laid against personal property or real estate. Then the fieri facias would be necessary to reach and realize on the debtor\u2019s interest in the property. An attachment execution is in substance, if not in form, an execution: Wray v. Tammany, 13 Pa. 394. . . . The plaintiffs having by their attachment succeeded to the rights of the defendant against his interest in decedent\u2019s estate to the extent of their claim must enforce their judgment against that interest, the amount of which can only be determined by the orphans\u2019 court: Maurer v. Kerper, 102 Pa. 444. That court has the exclusive jurisdiction to ascertain the amount of the estates of decedents, and to order their distribution among those entitled, creditors as well as legatees and distributees: Hammett\u2019s Appeal, 83 Pa. 392; Maurer v. Kerper, supra; Yocum v. Commercial Nat. Bank, 195 Pa. 411 [46 A. 94]. Hence on the final settlement and distribution of the estate of Andrew M. Moore by the orphans\u2019 court, the plaintiffs may have determined the interest of Albert H. Moore, the defendant, therein, and enforce their rights to said interest acquired by this attachment proceeding. The order discharging the rule, to strike off the writ of fieri facias is reversed and the rule is now made absolute and the writ is set aside. The judgment of the court below against the garnishees is so far modified as to restrain its collection until the interest, if any, of the defendant in the estate of Andrew M. Moore is due and payable; and as thus modified, the judgment is affirmed.\u201d\nIn Hess\u2019s Estate, 27 Pa. Superior Ct. 498, that court said: \u201cThe Act of April 13, 1843, P. L. 233, section 10, which rendered liable to execution attachment legacies and any interest in the estate of any decedent, expressly provides that \u2018the same rights in all respects which the debtor may have, and no greater in any respect whatever are hereby placed within the power of the attaching creditor;\u2019 . . . The Act of April 10, 1849, P. L. 619, section 11, authorized the issuing and service of an exeration attachment at any time after the interest of any person in the estate of a decedent had accrued by reason of the death of such decedent. The effect of this was to make clear the legislative intention that the interest of any person in the estate of a decedent should be subject to attachment before the amount of such interest had been determined, but the extent of the rights acquired by the attaching creditor, and the conditions subject to which those rights are to: be exercised, remain subject to the provisions of the Act of 1843 above referred to. The appellant attached the uncertain interest of his debtor in an unadministered estate. The remedy was purely statutory and the rights acquired only such as the statute gave. Had the executors, upon answers to interrogatories, admitted that there Avere sufficient funds of the debtor in their hands to pay this claim, judgment might have been entered against them in their representative capacity for the amount of the debt: Gochenaur\u2019s Executors v. Hostetter, 18 Pa. 414; Lorenz\u2019s Administrators v. King, 38 Pa. 93. Upon that state of facts, however, even had the executors paid the debt, the appellant would still have been liable upon his bond to be called upon to refund, if by the final decree of the orphans\u2019 court it was determined that at .the time of the service of the attachment the interest of the debtor in the estate was less than the amount which had been recovered. His ultimate rights under his attachment Avere, as against all who were not parties to and were not heard in that proceeding, subject to the final adjudication of the orphans\u2019 court. Where the amount of the legacy or distributive share can only be determined by a settlement of the estate, the court of common pleas will not determine what goods or effects are in the hands of the executors or administrators, although it may determine how much money is due to the plaintiff from the heir or legatee, and the amount which has been paid by the executor or administrator to the legatee on account of his distributive share.\u201d In Sinnickson v. Painter, 32 Pa. 384, this court said that \u201cit is in the power of the court to mould the judgment against the executor or administrator into such form that no injustice will be done to any one.\u201d That case referred to a foreign attachment, but in Lorenz\u2019s Administrators v. King, 38 Pa. 93, Ave also said: \u201cThe same rule is applicable to attachment executions under the Acts of April 13, 1843, and April 10, 1849.\u201d\nIn Butler Co. Nat. Bk. v. MacMullen, 292 Pa. 556, 141 A. 484, which was a case involving attachment executions against executors and trustees, we held that a verdict against the executors as garnishees for a certain sum, the same being \u201cthe total amount of the judgment and accrued interest\u201d was erroneous, and we remoulded the verdict to conform to \u201cthe amount of money in the hands of the garnishee.\u201d In Bouslough v. Bouslough, 68 Pa. 495, this court said: \u201cThe legacy share or interest in the estate being now subject to attachment as soon as it accrues, and before it has been ascertained by any decree in the Orphans\u2019 Court, it is\u00a1 impossible for the jury to comply with the provision in the 58th section of the Act of 13th June 1836, by finding what goods or effects were in the hands of the garnishees at the time of the execution of the attachment and the value thereof. There are the demands of the creditors of the decedent himself, which must be ascertained and be satisfied before anything can remain for the legatees or next of kin. Then there are the questions of debt and advancement between the estate and the distributee or legatee, which must be settled before the share or legacy can be ascertained. The attachment transfers to the attaching creditor only the right of the debtor in the estate, subject to all claims of the garnishee as the representative of the estate in his hands: Sec. 2d, Act 27th July 1842, sec. 10th, Act 13th April 1843; and see Strong\u2019s Exrs. v. Bass, 11 Casey 333; . . . Thus it is eAddent that a jury in order to find the sum due or coming to the debtor from tlie garnishee as executor or administrator, would be compelled to settle the administration account itself, a thing improper, inconvenient and belonging to the Orphans\u2019 Court alone.\u201d In Maurer v. Kerper, 102 Pa. 444, this court declared that \u201cwhere the amount of the legacy or distributive share can only be determined by a settlement of the estate, the court of common pleas will not determine what goods or effects are in the hands of the executor or administrator,\u201d and held that the judgment should be against the executor, qua executor, for the amount of plaintiff\u2019s judgment, to be levied of the interest of the defendant in the estate of the decedent. See also Seip v. Laubach, 333 Pa. 225.\nWe agree with the appellant when he challenges the following statement of the court below: \u201cThis is a matter strictly for the Orphans\u2019 Court and exclusively in its jurisdiction. . . . That court will have to determine for itself whether the interest of the defendant is a vested interest in which event, if it is, the attachments hold, subject to certain limitations.\u201d Appellant adds: \u201cThe right of the court to dissolve this attachment goes unquestioned.\u201d The corollary of this is that it is within the power of the court to refuse to dissolve the attachment. In Wheaton Coal Co. v. Harris et al., supra, the power of the Court of Common Pleas to decide whether a devisee\u2019s interest in an estate was vested or contingent was clearly recognized. As Justice Sharswood, speaking for this court in Van Dyke\u2019s Appeal, 60 Pa. 481, said: \u201cIt is the settled doctrine that the jurisdiction of that court within its appointed orbit is exclusive: Whiteside v. Whiteside, 8 Harris 473; Shollenberger\u2019s Appeal, 9 Harris 337; Black v. Black, 10 Casey 354; . . . But it is not in every case, which may incidentally bear upon the settlement of the estate of a decedent, that its jurisdiction is exclusive; otherwise, all remedies for the recovery of claims against such estates would necessarily .be drawn within its vortex. This has never been pretended: McLean\u2019s Executors v. Wade, 3 P. F. Smith 146; Sergeant\u2019s Executors v. Ewing, 6 Casey 75.\u201d See also Linsenbigler v. Gourley, 56 Pa. 166, and Wickersham\u2019s Appeal, 64 Pa. 67.\nIn a case of doubt as to whether or not an interest in a decedent\u2019s estate had vested in a debtor, a court of common pleas would refuse to permit an attachment of such an interest and would direct the creditor to await the determination of the question by the orphans\u2019 court. As this court said in Penna. Co., Exr., v. Youngman et al., 314 Pa.. 277, 282, 171 A. 594: \u201cDefendant\u2019s contingent interest could not be seized: Patterson v. Caldwell, 124 Pa. 455, 17 A. 18, but, from the time it vested, it became subject to attachment, like amy other property [italics supplied] coming into the hands of the garnishee..... Frazier v. Berg, 306 Pa. 317, 325, 159 A. 541.\u201d That defendant\u2019s interest had vested in him was a fact which the court was not required to ignore because of the garnishee\u2019s assertion of its nonexistence.\nWe therefore uphold the refusal of the court to dissolve the attachment but in order that the judgment entered should conform to the precedents laid down by this court we modify the judgment entered so that it reads as follows:\nJudgment is entered in favor of the plaintiff and against the garnishee, Alexander Wilson, Jr., Executor and Trustee under the will of Alexander Wilson, deceased, qua executor and trustee, in the sum of $9,917.42 with costs, and interest from October 27, 1937, to the extent that the same may become payable after due determination of the Orphans\u2019 Court, out of the share or interest of Edgar M. Wilson, defendant, in the Estate of Alexander Wilson, deceased. All further proceedings must abide such determination. As thus modified, the judgment is affirmed."}
