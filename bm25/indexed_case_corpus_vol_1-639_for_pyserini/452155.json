{"id": "452155", "contents": "Mr. Justice Clark\ndelivered the opinion of the court, October 3d 1883.\nThe Auditor, upon a review of this case, finds that there is no evidence of any willful default or bad faith on the part of Edward G> Fahnestock, the trustee, and that the charge of gross negligence is not made out.\nThe finding of an Auditor is entitled to great consideration, and will not be set aside, except for plain mistake; when this is shown, as we have said in Chew\u2019s Appeal, 9 Wright 230, \u201c like all other judicial proceedings, it is subject to correction.\u201d Additional force is given to an Auditor\u2019s report by the confirmation of the court: Bull\u2019s Appeal, 12 Harris 286; Dellinger\u2019s Appeal, 21 P. F. S. 425. The finding of an Auditor upon the facts, which has been approved by the court below, will not be disturbed on appeal, except .for flagrant error: Gilbert\u2019s Appeal, 78 Penn. St. 266. On the other hand, it must necessarily have less weight, when that confirmation or approval is refused: Bachman\u2019s Appeal, 38 Leg. Int. 393.\nIn the present case the Auditor and the court have arrived at widely different conclusions, and therefore it is our duty, giving the report of the Auditor that weight to which it is in itself entitled, to determine which view of the case best accords with the facts exhibited in the proof, and the law as declared in similar cases.\nAt the time of the appointment of Edward G-. Fahnestock, as successor to Benjamin Deford, in the trust, under the will of Joseph Baugher, deceased, the real estate had all been sold, according to the directions of the will, and the entire trust fund and property consisted of the following, viz :\nMortgage \u2014 -Sanford Schroder . . $2,416.66\nNote \u2014 Samuel Fahnestock . . . 5,200.00\nThree months\u2019 Interest . . . 78.00\nCheek \u2014 Benjamin Deford . . . 2,282.89\nTotal . . $9,977.55\nThese were the assets which actually came into Fahnestock\u2019s hands, as trustee; one-half of this was held by him in trust for Annie M. Baker, the other half for Caroline Heiner, under the terms and conditions of the will. The principal of the trust fund, being thus already invested, no duty of speedy collection or disbursement devolved upon the trustee; what was more desirable was a secure and continuous investment. If the investments, already made, were in his judgment safe and -secure, it was his duty, under the circumstances, to leave them -undisturbed.\nThe mortgage of $2,416.66 was the first lien upon the -mansion or home farm of Joseph Baugher, deceased, containing 155 acres, for which Schroder, the mortgagor, had paid .at public sale $4,000. This certainly seemed an ample security for the indebtedness, such as a carelul and prudent man would have considered good, and we think the trustee was right in accepting the assignment as a safe investment. It is true, Schroder had' not been very prompt in the payment of interest, but he was then but little, if any, in arrear. After Mr. Fahne-stock\u2019s appointment, however, the interest was not so .promptly paid, and in 1877, when judgment was taken on the \u00a1mortgage, the arrears of interest were $580. Schroder was a half brother of Mrs. Baker and Mrs. Heiner, being a son of the widow of Joseph Baugher, deceased, by a previous marriage. The trustee testifies that he was induced by the exceptant, Mrs. Baber, not to enforce prompt payment of the interest by Schroder; this Mrs. Baber denies. The Auditor says, \u201c the denial is as emphatic and positive as the trustee\u2019s assertion \u2014 a flat contradiction,\u201d and without passing on this disputed matter, he finds that \u201c the trustee suffered the unpaid interest to accumulate, upon the honest belief that it was safe and in no danger of loss.\u201d\nIn the spring of 1877, Sanford Schroder made an' assignment for creditors, and the farm was at that time appraised at the sum of $3,000. The decrease in the valuation seems to have been the result of a general depreciation in real estate prior to 1877, attributable perhaps to the effect of the panic of 1873. It appears from the testimony, and the Auditor so finds, that the trustee inquired, from time to time, of those residing in the neighborhood of this farm, and that they fixed the value at about $3,000, and that from information thus received he was satisfied it was safe. After obtaining judgment upon his mortgage, Falmestocb proceeded against the land, and on the 14th April 1877, purchased it at sheriff\u2019s sale, as trustee, at the sum of $2,000. From that time he held the land as part of the trust estate, receiving the rents, paying for repairs, taxes, &e. We are of opinion that the Auditor was right in determining that there was no evidence of willful default, or mala tides ; and that, in view of the positive testimony, showing that the trustee made frequent inquiries and received estimates of the neighbors, satisfying him that the trust was safe, \u201c and that he acted, or rather rested in this belief,\u201d the charge of gross or supine negligence was not made out.\nThe purchase of the land at the sheriff\u2019s sale, under the circumstances, was compulsory. If he could, by reasonable diligence, have bnown the actual depreciation earlier, and brought the land upon the marbet sooner, better results might probably have been obtained; but it is a fact, bnown to all, that there is no article of commerce which admits of as varied and uncertain judgment, as to value, even among the well-informed, as real estate. There are so many elements or factors entering into a proper estimate, matters present and prospective, that a correct judgment is with difficulty formed. We are of opinion that this trustee acted in good faith, and that he should not be charged with interest on the mortgage debt beyond what he received. We thinb he should be\u2019held to account on .the footing of his repurchase of the land for the benefit of the trust estate, and that therefore the costs of the levari facias, the taxes and repairs, the loss upon the mortgage debt, together with the amount invested in the purchase at the sheriff\u2019s sale, are proper credits in his account. We are of opinion also that he is entitled to commissions at the rate fixed in the will, and to reasonable expenses.\nThe measure of diligence and care required of a trustee, is precisely that which a man of ordinary prudence would practice in the care of his own estate. This rule has been so often laid down in our books that it seems unnecessary to refer to any authorities on that point. A reasonable degree of vigilance and the exercise of good faith is the standard of the trustee\u2019s duty. The office is often a thankless one, and if, as we said in Eyster\u2019s Appeal, 4 Harris 372, guardian's or trustees \u201c are to be held responsible for all negligence, and are not allowed the exercise of a reasonable discretion and prudential care in the management of their trusts, it will deter prudent men from assuming the office, which in itself is sufficiently onerous and already undertaken by such men with reluctance.\u201d\nThis practically disposes of all the matters covered by the exceptions or which were submitted to the judgment of the Auditor. The court below, however, in the opinion and decree filed, took up other matters not in issue before the Auditor, and therefore, not referred to by him in his report, and these constituted the main features of the opinion of the court in the discussion of the question of the trustee\u2019s liability. The court held the trustee liable for certain portions of the principal which it is alleged and stated in the account were paid over, with the interest, by the trustee to Anna M. Baker, the exceptant, under \u201c an agreement.\u201d As these payments of principal were not excepted to, were not examined nor considered by the Auditor were not embraced in the exceptions to his report, we cannot see how they became matters proper for adjudication. \u201c The agreement \u201d referred to, is not* produced or shown in evidence ; the \u201c bond and release \u201d are not before us; no testimony was taken on that subject. Wo are necessarily confined in our investigation of the case to the issue distinctly presented. It may be that this application of the principal of the trust was an improper one, but we can only determine that question when.it comes regularly before us.\nThe decree is therefore reversed, the report of the auditor confirmed and it is ordered that the \" appellee shall pay the costs of this appeal."}
