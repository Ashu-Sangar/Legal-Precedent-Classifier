{"id": "885505", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nA careful consideration of this record has failed to convince us that there was any substantial error in the trial. On the contrary, the instructions complained of in the assignments of error appear to be correct. The case depended on questions of fact which were properly submitted to the jury and by them found in favor of the plaintiff.\nFor reasons given in the court\u2019s opinion on the motion for a new trial, we think the judgment should not be disturbed.\n.Judgment affirmed."}
