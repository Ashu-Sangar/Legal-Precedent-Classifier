{"id": "486126", "contents": "Mr. Justice Paxson,\ndelivered the opinion of the court,\nWhenever the real estate of a debtor is sold by the sheriff the proceeds must be distributed among the lien-creditors, and the surplus, if any remaining, must be paid to the debtor: Act of 16th June 1836, sect. 93, Pamph. L. 777. That is precisely what the court below did here. The appellant, however, is not satisfied with the decree, hence this appeal. The difficulty which the appellant has to meet is that the lien of his testator\u2019s judgment has expired. It was revived against the original defendant without joining the terre-tenant. After the lien was lost by this omission, Hearing, the terre-tenant, confessed a judgment in favor of Landis. The property was sold on a judgment against Kauffman, Hearing\u2019s vendor, and it was contended by appellant that because the real estate was sold as the property of Kauffman'and not of Hearing, the proceeds must go to Kauffman\u2019s lien-creditors; that is to say, to the appellant\u2019s judgment, the lien whereof had expired. We need not discuss this proposition. That there is nothing in it is settled by a host of authorities. I will only refer to Ficke\u2019s Appeal, 21 P. F. Smith 447.\nIt was said, however, that even if the lien of appellant\u2019s judgment had expired, he was entitled to the fund for the reason that Hearing had made a parol promise to Kauffman to pay this judgment, and that he kept back so much of the purchase-money. This would be wrenching the recent \u201cunder and subject\u201d cases out of all manner of shape. The most that can be said is, that Hearing may have made himself liable to an action on the part of the holder of the judgment. That such a promise could galvanize into life this dead lien so as to entitle it to claim the proceeds of a sheriff\u2019s sale is a proposition exceedingly difficult to sustain.\nAfter paying the liens the court below awarded the balance of the fund to the owner of the land sold. This was in strict conformity to the Act of Assembly. But here again the appellant interposes and says: It is true I have lost my lien, but Hearing promised to pay my judgment, and he has that much of the purchase-money in his hands. The appellant seems to forget that a mere contract creditor has not even a right to be heard upon a question of distribution, nor can he take a writ of error. This is settled law: Smith v. Reiff, 8 Harris 364. The promise to pay the judgment was at most an agreement to indemnify the vendor; it was not a promise to pay out of the land, nor did the promise run with the land; it created no estate upon condition which would revert to the vendor upon breach of condition. To create such estate the intention must be expressed by apt words in the deed : Hiester v. Green, 12 Wright 96; Bortz v. Bortz, Id. 382; Perry v. Scott, 1 P. F. Smith 119. Nor is there any equitable lien for the purchase-money. After the legal title has passed the lien must be expressly charged upon the land: Kauffelt v. Bower, 7 S. & R. 64; Strauss\u2019s Appeal, 13 Wright 353; Trinity Church v. Watson, 14 Id. 518.\nThere is no room for estoppel. The appellant\u2019s testator parted with nothing and did nothing by reason of Hearing\u2019s promise to pay his judgment. If the money is lost, it will be by reason of his laches in not reviving his judgment so as to hold the terretenant.\nThe decree is affirmed; and the appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant."}
