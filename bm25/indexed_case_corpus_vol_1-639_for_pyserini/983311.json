{"id": "983311", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe think this case is ruled by Bradstreet v. Everson, 72 Pa. 124, and by Morgan v. Tener, 83 Pa. 305. The defendants, having undertaken the collection of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, are responsible for the neglect of the attorney employed by them by which the claims were lost. The question of defendants\u2019 negligence was fairly submitted to the jury, and their verdict is conclusive upon the question of fact. \u00a1,\nJudgment affirmed."}
