{"id": "1892962", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nThe executrix of the will of Samuel J. Mohney, Mabel H. Mohney, who was decedent\u2019s second wife, and Esther L. Mohney, who was decedent\u2019s first wife, joined in a petition for a declaratory judgment which was filed in the Orphans\u2019 Court to determine (1) who was the owner of a $25 U. S. Treasury Bond which was registered in the name of Samuel J. Mohney or Mrs. Esther L. Mohney, and (2) who was entitled to the proceeds of a group life insurance policy issued to the decedent, in which his first wife (Esther L. Mohney) was named, by name, as beneficiary. The Orphans\u2019 Court decided that the first wife was entitled (1) to half the value of the U. S. bond, and (2) to all of the proceeds of the group life insurance policy.\nWhy declaratory proceedings were brought instead of the customary and appropriate way of filing an account and presenting the questions at the audit of decedent\u2019s account, was not disclosed. This proceeding was improper for each of the following reasons:\n(1) While the grant of a petition for a declaratory judgment is a matter of sound judicial discretion:\n\u201cThis Court now adheres to the view that declaratory judgment proceedings must not be entertained if there exists another available and appropriate remedy, whether statutory or not: McWilliams v. McCabe, 406 Pa. 644, 179 A. 2d 222; State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Semple, 407 Pa. 572, 180 A. 2d 925.\u201d Lakeland Joint School District Authority v. Scott Township School District, 414 Pa. 451, 200 A. 2d 748.\nIn State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Semple, 407 Pa., supra, the Court said (pages 574-575) : \u201cThe principles to guide the lower courts in determining whether or not a declaratory judgment proceeding should be entertained was recently clarified by this Court in McWilliams v. McCabe, 406 Pa. 644, 179 A. 2d 222 (1962). Therein we declared, inter alia, (1) that a declaratory judgment proceeding is not an optional substitute for established and available remedies; (2) that it should not be granted where a more appropriate remedy is available; (3) that it should not be granted unless compelling and unusual circumstances exist; (4) that it should not be granted where there is a dispute of facts, or such controversy may arise; and (5) that it should not be granted unless there is a clear manifestation that the declaration sought will be a practical help in terminating the controversy.\u201d\n(2) Section 11 of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act of June 18,1923, P. L. 840, as amended, \u00a7841, requires as an essential requisite the joinder of all parties who have an interest, as well as those who claim or may have an interest which would be affected by the declaratory relief sought, and neither the insurance company which issued the group life policy nor the testator\u2019s heirs were made parties in the Orphans\u2019 Court proceedings.\nJudgment vacated and petition dismissed, each party to pay own costs."}
