{"id": "1841430", "contents": "OPINION\nMONTEMURO, Justice.\nThis is the appeal of Charles E. Cross, appellant, from a final order of the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County denying relief under the Post Conviction Relief Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9541 et seq. Because this is a case in which the death penalty has been imposed, jurisdiction over this appeal is conferred on this Court by 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9546(d) (1988).\nAppellant was convicted by a jury on March 1, 1982, for the murders of Denise Lucic and her two children, Danielle, age 7 and John, Jr., age 3. The jury found appellant guilty of three counts of first degree murder, and following a sentencing hearing, determined that aggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances. The jury fixed the penalty at death and a direct appeal was taken to this Court. Following our mandatory review of such appeals, we affirmed the conviction and judgment of the sentence of death, Commonwealth v. Cross, 508 Pa. 322, 496 A.2d 1144 (1985). Appellant was scheduled to be executed on October 2, 1990.\nOn September 27, 1990 a stay of execution was granted, pending proceedings under the Post Conviction Relief Act (PCRA). The final petition under that act was filed on February 3, 1992. Two separate hearings were held, and on June 2,1992, the request for post conviction relief was denied. This appeal ensued.\nOn appeal, appellant claims that the two lawyers representing him were ineffective in five areas. First, he contends that his attorneys were ineffective because of their failure to develop and present a defense based on insanity or diminished capacity. Second, he asserts that counsel were ineffective for fading to fully explore appellant\u2019s family background and mental history during the sentencing phase of the trial, and as a result failed to present evidence of mitigating circumstances. Third, appellant asserts that counsel were ineffective for failure to request a jury instruction correcting a misstatement made by appellant in the sentencing phase of the trial.\nIn addition to these alleged constitutional deficiencies in appellant\u2019s representation, appellant\u2019s fourth claim charges his lawyers with ineffectiveness for failing to adequately preserve, for appellate review, counsels\u2019 objection to the trial court\u2019s charge to the jury. Finally, appellant contends that his attorneys were ineffective because they failed to object to the verdict slip submitted to the jury.\nFor the first time in this appeal, appellant also asserts that if this Court determines that the death penalty hearing was defective, then a sentence of life imprisonment should be entered. In essence, appellant contends that 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(h)(2), as amended, should not apply to him. This section provides that upon a showing that the death penalty hearing was defective, the Supreme Court shall remand for a new sentencing hearing.\nIn order for appellant to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, he must first demonstrate that the underlying claim is of arguable merit. Once that is established, he must then show that his lawyer\u2019s action or inaction lacked any reasonable basis for advancing his client\u2019s interests. In addition, appellant must demonstrate that the commission or omission of counsel so undermined the trial that the verdict is unreliable. Commonwealth v. Carpenter, 533 Pa. 40, 617 A.2d 1263 (1992).\nThe presumption is that counsel is effective. Commonwealth, v. Pierce, 515 Pa. 153, 159, 527 A.2d 973, 975 (1987), citing Commonwealth v. Miller, 494 Pa. 229, 431 A.2d 233 (1981). The burden of proving ineffectiveness of counsel is on the party alleging it, and that burden does not shift. Commonwealth v. Jones, 324 Pa.Super. 359, 471 A.2d 879 (1984).\nWe review appellant\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel guided by these standards. After considering each claim individually, we conclude that appellant\u2019s claims are without basis, and therefore affirm the order of the trial court denying PCRA relief.\nAppellant first argues that his lawyers were constitutionally deficient because they did not introduce evidence of appellant\u2019s insanity or diminished capacity during the guilt phase of appellant\u2019s murder trial. Throughout both the guilt phase and the sentencing phase of the trial, appellant maintained his innocence. To have introduced evidence of appellant\u2019s insanity or diminished capacity would have directly conflicted with appellant\u2019s position of innocence. To plead the defense of insanity suggests that the defendant committed the act, but was not legally culpable. Commonwealth v. Mizell, 493 Pa. 161, 164, 425 A.2d 424, 426 (1981). Here, appellant maintained that he had not committed the murders. Therefore, it would have been improper for his attorneys to introduce any evidence of insanity.\nIn Mizell this Court determined that trial counsel had acted properly in not advancing an insanity defense when the lucid defendant had insisted upon his innocence, and had refused to submit to a psychological examination. Mizell, 493 Pa. at 164, 425 A.2d at 426. It is now argued that counsel erred by yielding to appellant\u2019s decision to plead innocence rather than insanity or diminished capacity. He claims that he was not sufficiently rational to make that type of decision regarding his defense. Moreover, he asserts that his lawyers were aware of his psychological deficiencies, and should have defied his instruction and pursued an insanity defense. These contentions are without merit.\nFirst, Rule 1.2 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Professional Conduct provides in part:\n(a) A Lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decisions concerning the objectives, of representation, ... and shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued ... In a criminal case, the lawyer shall abide by the client\u2019s decision, after consultation with the lawyer, as to a plea to be entered, whether to waive jury trial and whether the client will testify.\nThe Comment to Rule 1.2 provides in part:\nThe client has ultimate authority to determine the purposes to be served by legal representation, within the limits imposed by law and the lawyer\u2019s professional obligations.\nBoth the Rule and the Comment make clear that the client is to decide the goal of counsel\u2019s representation. Moreover, the Rule does not furnish counsel with the right to override what the client considers to be in his best interest. This is particularly true where it has been determined that the client is competent to stand trial.\nTo be competent for trial a defendant must be capable of understanding the nature and objective of proceedings against him, and be able to cooperate with his legal representative in presentation of his defense. Commonwealth v. Martinez, 498 Pa. 387, 446 A.2d 899 (1982). A determination of competency to stand trial would support a determination that appellant was equipped with the same \u201clucidity\u201d required under Mizell. Hence, appellant was mentally capable of making decisions about his defense, and counsel properly complied with his wishes regarding the goals of his representation.\nAs a subordinate argument, appellant claims that his attorneys were ineffective because they failed to further investigate appellant\u2019s family background and mental competency. Appellant presents this claim in two contexts. First, he asserts that his attorneys failed to investigate fully appellant\u2019s mental competency. Then, he asserts that they failed to properly develop, through testimony in the sentencing phase of the trial, appellant\u2019s troubled childhood. These claims are also without merit.\nCounsel commissioned Dr. Eberle, a noted forensic psychologist, to examine and evaluate appellant. The psychological report equipped counsel with the information necessary to present a constitutionally effective defense. Dr. Eberle evaluated appellant\u2019s current mental status and psychodynamic profile. In addition, he assisted in making the determination that appellant was competent to stand trial. Dr. Eberle also evaluated appellant to determine if there were any possible consistencies between appellant\u2019s personality profile/type and criminal tendencies or capacity for prevarication.\nExploration into appellant\u2019s criminal responsibility would have been pointless since the defense of insanity or diminished capacity was not going to be used. In fact, it was impossible, according to Dr. Eberle, to make that determination while appellant maintained his innocence. Therefore, the investigation taken by counsel was constitutionally sufficient.\nAppellant next contends that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to investigate and fully present the appellant\u2019s family background and mental history during the sentencing phase of the trial. Appellant asserts that they failed to fully develop his family background by not interviewing appellant\u2019s brother and sisters. Moreover, appellant argues that trial counsel should have called appellant\u2019s sister, Rose Luchan, to testify as to the traumatic nature of appellant\u2019s childhood during the penalty phase of the trial.\nWe must determine whether counsel\u2019s performance in evaluating the mitigating evidence available to him and in deciding not to pursue further mitigating evidence undermines confidence in the adversarial process of this case. Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776, 107 S.Ct. 3114, 97 L.Ed.2d 638 (1987). In this determination, we must be highly deferential to the decisions of counsel. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).\nIn preparation of appellant\u2019s defense, at both the guilt phase and the sentencing phase, appellant\u2019s lawyers investigated appellant\u2019s family background and social history. The psychological report commissioned from Dr. Eberle, mentioned above, also developed appellant\u2019s family background, and detailed aspects of his troubled childhood. Moreover, counsel spoke with both appellant Cross and his sister regarding his background. Counsel did not interview appellant\u2019s other siblings.\nAppellant contends that his lawyers\u2019 failure to contact his other siblings was error. However, appellant does not specify what mitigating information they could have added to assist in his defense, other than to provide cumulative evidence of his childhood. Therefore, considering ineffectiveness of counsel based upon their omitted testimony is too tenuous and speculative. Commonwealth v. Blagman, 350 Pa.Super. 367, 504 A.2d 883 (1986), appeal denied 514 Pa. 645, 524 A.2d 492 (1987).\nAppellant suggests that the investigation undertaken by counsel was insufficient to equip them with information sufficient to present mitigating factors at the penalty phase. Appellant\u2019s attorneys did present four mitigating factors during the sentencing phase. The four mitigating circumstances presented pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S.A \u00a7 9711 were: Section 9711(e)(1), the defendant had no significant history of prior criminal convictions; Section 9711(e)(2), the defendant was under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance at the time of the offense; Section 9711(e)(3), the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired; and Section 9711(e)(8), other mitigating circumstances. Appellant\u2019s lawyers presented these mitigating circumstances through the testimony of appellant Cross and Dr. Eberle. Counsel did not call appellant\u2019s sister, Rose Luchan, to testify, nor did they direct specific questions about appellant\u2019s childhood to either appellant or Dr. Eberle.\nThis tactic taken by appellant\u2019s attorneys was reasonable in light of the brutal nature of the murders. Trial counsel believed that the proposed evidence would have little potency. Moreover, counsel believed that introducing evidence of appellant\u2019s childhood difficulties would be perceived by the jury as trivializing the murders. This strategy was reasonable in order to avoid the possible perception that appellant did not appreciate the gravity of the crimes. Therefore, counsels\u2019 development of mitigating circumstances was well within the range of professionally competent assistance constitutionally required.\nAppellant\u2019s third claim of ineffective assistance of legal representation is based upon the assertion that trial counsel did not ask for a jury instruction which would correct a misstatement appellant had made about the possibility of receiving parole.\nDuring the penalty phase of the trial, appellant did make reference to the possibility of being paroled if he was given a life sentence rather than death. Appellant argues that the jury\u2019s fear of the possibility of his parole caused them to enter a sentence of death. Although appellant was not correct in his statement that he would be eligible for parole if given a sentence of life imprisonment, the record reveals this to have been a calculated strategy on the part of appellant to evoke sympathy from the jury, and another example of appellant\u2019s attempting to avoid responsibility for decisions he made regarding the objectives of his trial. Appellant chose to offer that testimony in the hope of engendering compassion from the jury. Now he would have us hold that his legal representatives were ineffective for adhering to their client\u2019s choice. In addition, counsel discussed this misstatement with appellant upon the completion of his testimony; they decided in concert, that no harm had resulted, and that nothing should be done about it.\nAppellant\u2019s misstatement did not undermine the validity of the penalty imposed. Moreover, counsel\u2019s decision not to take action was rational. Therefore, appellant has not met the burden of proof necessary to grant relief under the PCRA.\nAppellant also asserts that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to object to and adequately preserve for review two issues regarding the trial court\u2019s jury instructions. First, appellant contends that counsel were ineffective because they did not object to the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury that the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witnesses were not permitted to examine petitioner until after the verdicts of guilty. Appellant\u2019s petition maintains that this was an impermissible comment upon his silence in violation of Article 1, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Fifth Amendment.\nThis argument is without merit. The instruction merely explains why the examinations were not performed by the doctors at an earlier time. It in no way suggests that appellant was asserting his right to remain silent.\nSince the underlying argument is without merit, it would have been futile for appellant\u2019s lawyers to object to the instruction. Therefore, no ineffective assistance of counsel claim will stand based upon this argument.\nSecond, appellant asserts that counsel were ineffective because they failed to raise on appeal the question of whether the Court of Common Pleas erred by failing to instruct the jury in a manner consistent with 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9711(c)(1)(v). This section provides in relevant part:\n[T]he court may, in its discretion, discharge the jury if it is of the opinion that further deliberation will not result in a unanimous agreement as to the sentence, in which case the court shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment.\nAgain, the ineffective assistance of counsel claim based upon this issue is without merit. This particular section is intended to give guidance to the court in cases where a jury is unable to reach a verdict after having spent a period of time deliberating. Since a request to have this instruction read would have been denied, defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to advance this argument.\nAppellant contends that his attorneys were ineffective for failing to object to the verdict slip submitted to the jury. Appellant asserts that the verdict slip was constitutionally deficient because it did not require the jury to make findings as to mitigating circumstances. While we now require the verdict form to include a space for the jury to list mitigating circumstances, it was not required when appellant was sentenced. Pa.R.Crim.P. 358A. Moreover, we have held that the Sentencing Code does not require the jury to specify the mitigating circumstances it found. Commonwealth v. Crispell, 530 Pa. 234, 608 A.2d 18 (1992), citing Commonwealth v. Carpenter, 511 Pa. 429, 515 A.2d 531 (1986). Therefore, the verdict slip was adequate at the time of appellant\u2019s sentencing, and any objection to the slip would have been denied. In addition, the adequacy of the verdict slip was addressed in appellant\u2019s application for extraordinary relief, which was denied by this court. Again, his argument cannot sustain a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel since his underlying claim is without merit.\nFinally, appellant asserts that if we find that appellant\u2019s death penalty hearing was defective, then a sentence of life imprisonment should be entered. We need not address this argument since we affirm the Court of Common Pleas decision denying appellant relief.\nAccordingly, the order of the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver County is affirmed.\n. Appellant statement at the penalty phase of the trial was as follows:\nThis july of twelve people have found me guilty of a crime that I did not commit. I stand before God Almighty as an innocent man. While you founded me guilty the guilty parties are still on the street. Eventually they are going to kill again. When they kill again possibly a confession could come forth. If you send me to the electric chair it wouldn\u2019t help me any. If you send me to a penitentiary for life, at least I could be released and get on with my life. I plead with this jury that you come back with a life sentence. And it is going to be a long sentence since I have time waiting for me in Virginia of fifteen years. From my understanding I will spend twenty years before I am eligible for parole here. That\u2019s thirty-five years I will be spending behind bars. I have nothing more to say. Just have mercy on me."}
