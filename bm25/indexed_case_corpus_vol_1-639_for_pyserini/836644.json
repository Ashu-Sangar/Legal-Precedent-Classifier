{"id": "836644", "contents": "Opinion bx\nMb. Justice Stebbett,\nWe are not satisfied there was any error in making the interlocutory order from which this appeal was taken. The controlling question in the case cannot be properly disposed of until final hearing on bill, answer and proofs. In the meantime, no irreparable mischief can be done to defendants.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed, with costs to be paid by appellants, without prejudice to the rights of said appellants as they may appear on final hearing. ."}
