{"id": "1122321", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe pleadings in this case consist of a statement of claim and an affidavit of defense raising questions of law; on these pleadings, the court below entered judgment for defendant, and plaintiffs have appealed.\nPlaintiffs averred that defendant had agreed to \u201cprovide a home for them and keep them in ease and comfort for the rest of their lives\u201d; that he would acquire a place \u201cin keeping with his wealth and station,\u201d to be their home, \u201cand convey it to them\u201d; that \u201che would provide them with adequate household money......and additional money from time to time as needed for incidental expenses;......and would provide plaintiffs with the use of an automobile and chauffeur\u201d; and that, in return, plaintiffs were to \u201csuperintend the household.\u201d Plaintiffs further averred that one of them had surrendered a salaried position on faith in these promises of defendant, but that tbe latter \u201cwas not living up to bis promises,\u201d and had \u201cfailed and refused......so .to do.\u201d Plaintiffs asked $75,000 damages.\nThe affidavit of defense alleged that \u201cThe statement of claim consists of a series of inferences and conclusions,\u201d too \u201cvague, indefinite, and uncertain\u201d to show \u201cthe essentials of a contract\u201d; that, so far as plaintiffs\u2019 claim of the right to a conveyance of real estate was concerned, \u201cthe alleged contract [was] parol [and] in contravention to......the statute of frauds.\u201d In short, the defendant in effect demurred that the case as pleaded could not properly be submitted to a jury.\nThe court below, in its opinion entering judgment for defendant, well states that, were the case, as pleaded, before it at jury trial, there would be \u201cno standard by which either court or jury could assess the damages for nonperformance\u201d of the alleged contract. In this conclusion we agree. As stated in Sherman v. Kitsmiller, 17 S. & R. 45, 47, 49, this is \u201cnot an action of indebitatus assumpsit, but an action on [a] special contract,\u201d and as there said, \u201cIn assumpsit for nonpayment of money ......[the] express promises or contracts ought to be certain and explicit, to a common intent at least;...... [here there is no allegation] of anything by which the value [of the compensation to be received by plaintiffs] could be regulated.\u201d See also Machen v. Budd Wheel Co., 294 Pa. 69.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
