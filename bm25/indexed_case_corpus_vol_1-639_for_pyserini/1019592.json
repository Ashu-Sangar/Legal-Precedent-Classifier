{"id": "1019592", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal is from the refusal of the court below to set aside a verdict taken by agreement and to strike off the judgment entered on it. The court found from testimony taken before a commissioner that the averments of fraud in appellant\u2019s petition to have the verdict set aside and the judgment stricken oft were false and that the verdict had been properly taken. This finding was amply justified, and the appeal is, therefore, dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
