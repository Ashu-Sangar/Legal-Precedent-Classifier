{"id": "838173", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Paxson,\nThis was an action upon the same lease as in Huber v. Baum, decided herewith, but commenced in another court, and with a different result. In the case in hand the learned judge entered judgment against the defendants for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence. As we have decided in the other case that a refusal to enter such a judgment was error it follows that the judgment in this case was right, and it is accordingly\nAffirmed."}
