{"id": "903557", "contents": "Pee Cueiam,\nThe learned judge of the court below refused to open the judgment in this case because he did not consider the affidavit of defense sufficient to prevent judgment. That was a very good reason for refusing to open the judgment. Upon examining the affidavit we find that it was insufficient to prevent judgment for the very reasons stated in the opinion of the court. That being so, there was no error in the refusal of the court to open the judgment."}
