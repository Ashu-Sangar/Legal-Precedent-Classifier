{"id": "850261", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe only subjects of complaint, in this ease, are the answers of the learned trial judge refusing defendant\u2019s sixth and seventh points, viz.: (a) \u201c There is no sufficient proof that the injuries complained of, ... . were caused by the negligence of the defendant; \u201d and (5), \u201c Under all evidence, .... the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d\nIn view of the testimony, tending to prove that the borough authorities were guilty of negligence, in that they permitted to remain, in the public sidewalk, a dangerous depression or \u201chole \u201d into which the plaintiff, in the night time, accidentally stepped and thereby sustained a severe and probably permanent injury, it would have been error to have withdrawn the case from the jury by affirming either of said points. Without undertaking to summarize the testimoriy, showing the dangerous condition of said sidewalk, particularly in the night time, the nature and extent of plaintiff\u2019s injury, etc., it was clearly sufficient to carry the case to the jury on the main questions of defendant\u2019s alleged negligence and plaintiff\u2019s resultant damages. Upon all the testimony, and with full and adequate instructions as to the duty of the defendant as well as the plaintiff himself, the case was fairly submitted to the jury; and, in the absence of any apparent error, to the prejudice of the defendant, the judgment entered on the verdict should not be disturbed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
