{"id": "1100683", "contents": "OPINION\nChief Justice CAPPY.\nThis is a direct appeal from the judgments of two sentences of death imposed on Lawrence Smith (\u201cAppellant\u201d). For the reasons expressed in this opinion, we affirm the first degree murder convictions but reverse his sentences of death and remand for a new penalty hearing.\nOn February 2, 2000, Appellant and an accomplice robbed Songha Willis (\u201cWillis\u201d) and several other people in a parking lot adjacent to a night club in Philadelphia. During the course of the robbery, Appellant shot and killed Willis.\nOn April 26, 2000, Appellant perpetrated yet another robbery at the same parking lot. During the course of this robbery, Appellant shot and killed Raeneal Quann (\u201cQuann\u201d). Appellant fled the scene, but was captured the next day in New Jersey.\nAppellant was tried before a jury. He was found guilty of two counts of first degree murder, one count of attempted murder, five counts of robbery, two counts of criminal conspiracy, and two counts of possessing instruments of crime. The matter then proceeded to the penalty phase. With regard to the Willis, murder, the jury found three aggravating circumstances: the defendant committed the killing while in perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6); the defendant created a grave risk of death to another person in committing the offense, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(7); and the defendant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9). With regard to the Quann murder, the jury found four aggravating circumstances: the defendant committed the killing while in perpetration of a felony, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(6); the defendant created a grave risk of death to another person in committing the offense, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(7); the defendant had a significant history of felony convictions involving the use or threat of violence to the person, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(9); and the defendant had been convicted of another murder committed either before or at the time of the offense at issue, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(d)(ll). The jury found no mitigating circumstances and returned sentences of death.\nThe trial court formally imposed the death sentences. It also sentenced Appellant to an aggregate term of twenty to forty years imprisonment on the remaining convictions. Appellant then filed the instant appeal to this court.\nIn his appeal, Appellant does not challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain his first degree murder convictions. Nevertheless, we are required to review the sufficiency of the evidence as this is a capital matter. See Commonwealth v. Rainey, 540 Pa. 220, 656 A.2d 1326, 1330 (1995). \u201cThe standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence is whether the evidence admitted at trial and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as the verdict winner, is sufficient to support all the elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Commonwealth v. DeJesus, 567 Pa. 415, 787 A.2d 394, 398 (2001). Evidence is sufficient to support a first degree murder conviction \u201cwhere the Commonwealth establishes that the defendant acted with a specific intent to kill; that a human being was unlawfully killed; that the person accused did the killing; and that the killing was done with deliberation.\u201d Commonwealth v. Gibson, 547 Pa. 71, 688 A.2d 1152, 1158 (1997) (citations omitted). Specific intent can be inferred where a deadly weapon is used upon a vital part of the body. Commonwealth v. Hanible, 575 Pa. 255, 836 A.2d 36, 38 (2003). Furthermore, where a defendant has the specific intent to kill, he can be found guilty of first degree murder, regardless of whether it was the defendant or a co-conspirator who actually inflicted the wound which resulted in death. See Gibson, supra; Commonwealth v. Huffman, 536 Pa. 196, 638 A.2d 961, 962 (1994).\nAt trial, Ted Patterson (\u201cPatterson\u201d) and Todd Rose (\u201cRose\u201d), two of the victims who survived the February 2, 2000 robbery, testified against Appellant. Patterson and Rose testified that on the night of the crime, Appellant and Appellant\u2019s accomplice brandished guns and demanded that Patterson, Willis, and Rose turn over their valuables. During the course of the robbery, Appellant ordered Willis to lie face-down on the ground; Willis complied. Once he was done relieving Willis of his valuables, Appellant shot Willis twice in the head; at the time he was shot, Willis was still lying face-down on the ground. This evidence was clearly sufficient to establish that Appellant was guilty of first degree murder in connection with the killing of Willis.\nAs to the murder of Quann, the evidence was sufficient to sustain the first degree murder conviction. Extensive testimony was received that on April 26, 2000, Appellant and three accomplices perpetrated another armed robbery at the same parking lot in which Appellant had killed Willis. During the course of this robbery, Appellant and his cohorts beat one of their victims. Appellant and his accomplices then retreated to their automobiles; as they did, Appellant, along with his co-conspirators, fired multiple shots into the crowd of people gathered outside the club. One of these bullets struck Quann in the head, killing him. This evidence is clearly sufficient to sustain the first degree murder conviction. Gibson, 688 A.2d at 1158 (where the defendant goes to a crowded bar with the intention of committing a robbery, fires shots into the crowd and kills two patrons as the result of gunshot wounds to vital parts of their bodies, such evidence supports the finding that defendant committed first degree murder).\nAppellant raises three issues in his brief to this court. The first is a claim that the first degree murder convictions are against the weight of the evidence. He contends that they are against the weight of the evidence because the jury did not credit Appellants version of events as contained in his statement to police. Appellant asserts that the convictions are \u201cshocking\u201d because they show that \u201cthe jury did not credit [the] most truthful and reliable eyewitness to the crimes, the Appellant.\u201d Appellants brief at 28.\nIn reviewing this claim, we are mindful that\na new trial can only be granted on a claim that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence in the extraordinary situation where the jury\u2019s verdict is so contrary to the evidence that it shocks one\u2019s sense of justice and the award of a new trial is imperative so that right may be given another opportunity to prevail. An appellate court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the finder of fact.\nCommonwealth v. Drumheller, 570 Pa. 117, 808 A.2d 893, 908 (2002) (citations omitted). Furthermore, where, as in the matter sub judice \u201cthe judge who presided at trial ruled on the weight claim below, an appellate court\u2019s role is not to consider the underlying question of whether the verdict is against the weight of the evidence. Rather, appellate review is limited to whether the trial court palpably abused its discretion in ruling on the weight claim.\u201d Commonwealth v. Tharp, 574 Pa. 202, 830 A.2d 519, 528 (2003) (citations omitted).\nWe conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant relief on this claim. The jury\u2019s guilty verdicts on the two homicide charges were not so contrary to the evidence as to shock the conscience; in fact, the weight of the evidence supported, rather than contradicted, the jury\u2019s verdict. Furthermore, Appellant cannot prevail on his claim merely because he believes that of all the evidence presented at trial, his statement was the most truthful. It is within the province of the jury, as the finder of fact, to decide whether a witness\u2019 testimony lacks credibility. Commonwealth v. Fisher, 564 Pa. 505, 769 A.2d 1116, 1123 (2001). The fact that the jury did not credit Appellant\u2019s statement does not militate that the verdicts are against the weight of the evidence; rather, that merely establishes that the jury did not find Appellant to be credible, a conclusion that they were empowered to make. We therefore deny Appellant relief on his weight of the evidence claim.\nAppellant\u2019s next two issues regard the penalty phase. We will first address Appellant\u2019s claim that the prosecutor improperly referred to Appellant being convicted of assaulting another prisoner with a weapon. See N.T., 2/25/2002, at 114. The prosecutor made such a statement in order to impeach Appellant\u2019s psychiatric expert who had opined that Appellant presented no danger to anyone in the prison population. Appellant asserts that there was no record evidence that Appellant had ever been convicted of assaulting another prisoner. Thus, he claims that the prosecutor improperly referenced a fact that was not in evidence.'\nIt is axiomatic that a prosecutor is \u201climited to making comments based upon the evidence and fair deductions and inferences therefrom.\u201d Commonwealth v. Joyner, 469 Pa. 333, 365 A.2d 1233, 1236 (1976). Our review of Appellant\u2019s Institutional Adjustment Summary records that were introduced at trial show that Appellant was charged with assaulting an inmate; these records do not, however, establish that Appellant was ever convicted of this offense.\nThe Commonwealth, however, claims that the conviction is a fact of record. In support of this claim, it points to testimony offered by the Commonwealth\u2019s psychiatric expert, Dr. John O\u2019Brien (\u201cDr. O\u2019Brien\u201d). The Commonwealth notes that on direct examination, Dr. O\u2019Brien indicated that Appellant was found guilty on the assault charge. N.T., 3/01/2002, 44-45.\nThe Commonwealth accurately recounts Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s testimony. Yet, that does not end our inquiry. Next we must determine whether this testimony, standing alone, serves to establish that Appellant was indeed convicted of assaulting a' fellow prisoner, thus rendering the prosecutor\u2019s remark as being properly based on a fact of record.\nWe conclude it does not. There is no indication that Dr. O\u2019Brien was present at, or somehow participated in, the alleged adjudication of Appellant on the charge of assaulting a prisoner. We therefore cannot find that his testimony regarding the alleged conviction constitutes evidence on the basis that he had personal knowledge of the conviction. See Pa. R.E. 602 (\u201cA witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\u201d). Furthermore, Dr. O\u2019Brien\u2019s status as an expert does not, in and of itself, render his unsupported reference to Appellant\u2019s alleged conviction of assaulting a fellow prisoner into a fact of record. Thus, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Appellant\u2019s alleged conviction for assaulting another prisoner improperly referenced a fact not of record.\nHaving concluded that there was error, we now turn to examining whether this error was harmless. In conducting this examination, we note that it is the burden of the Commonwealth to convince this court that the error was harmless. Commonwealth v. Young, 561 Pa. 34, 748 A.2d 166, 193 (1999). The Commonwealth has failed to meet its burden. In fact, it makes no argument regarding harmless error.\nFurthermore, we do not perceive how the Commonwealth could meet this burden. Harmless error may be established in one of three ways: (1) the error did not prejudice the defendant or the prejudice was only de minimis; (2) the erroneously admitted evidence was cumulative of other properly admitted evidence; or (3) \u201cthe prejudicial effect of the error is so insignificant by comparison to the other evidence that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error could not have contributed to the jury\u2019s decision regarding the death penalty.\u201d Commonwealth v. Edmiston, 535 Pa. 210, 634 A.2d 1078, 1090 (1993).\nThe Commonwealth could not meet the first two alternatives of establishing harmless error. The prejudicial effect of the prosecutor\u2019s statement that Appellant had been convicted of assaulting a fellow prisoner could certainly not be considered de minimis, particularly when taken in the context of impeaching Appellant\u2019s expert on his opinion that Appellant posed no threat to the prison population. Furthermore, it was not cumulative of other properly admitted evidence; our review of the record reveals that there was no other properly admitted evidence regarding whether Appellant was convicted of assaulting a fellow inmate.\nFinally, we do not believe that the Commonwealth could establish that \u201cthe prejudicial effect of the error is so insignificant by comparison to the other evidence that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error could not have contributed to the jury\u2019s decision regarding the death penalty.\u201d Edmiston, 634 A.2d at 1090. The reference to Appellants alleged conviction for assaulting another prisoner was a powerful rebuttal of the opinion Appellants expert offered in mitigation that Appellant posed no risk to the prison population. Furthermore, the jury declined to find the existence of any mitigating circumstance. Considering the clearly damaging effect that this statement would have had on Appellants case in mitigation, and that the jury ultimately failed to find any mitigating circumstance, we cannot conclude that the prejudicial effect of this error was so insignificant that the error was harmless.\nAccordingly, we conclude that the prosecutor improperly referred to a fact not of record and that the Commonwealth has failed to establish that this error was harmless. Thus, while we affirm the convictions for first degree murder, we must reverse the sentences of death and remand for a new penalty hearing.\n. Sentences of death are subject to automatic review by this court. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9711(h)(1).\n. While Appellant lodged no objection to the prosecutor\u2019s statement at trial, this issue is saved from a finding of waiver via the relaxed waiver doctrine.\nWe acknowledge that we recently abrogated the relaxed waiver doctrine; yet we did so prospectively only. Commonwealth v. Freeman, 573 Pa. 532, 827 A.2d 385 (2003). Thus, Freeman states that the relaxed waiver doctrine is still applicable to those matters in which the appellant's brief was filed prior to our disposition of Freeman or within 30 days of Freeman being handed down. As Appellant\u2019s brief was filed prior to our disposition of Freeman, he is entitled to the benefits of the relaxed waiver doctrine.\n. Because we are reversing the sentences of death based upon this claim, we need not reach the merits of Appellant\u2019s other penalty phase issue."}
