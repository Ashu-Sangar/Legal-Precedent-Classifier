{"id": "1901721", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Bell,\nMarie Sorschek died September 4, 1964, leaving a holographic will dated August 27, 1963, and a holographic codicil dated August 28, 1964. Letters testamentary were granted to Paula Roseling who was the executrix named in the will and is also the appellant herein. Testatrix\u2019s estate totaled $60,713.48 and was\nmade up as follows:\n(a) Cash in three bank accounts.....$ 3,227.81\n(b) Stocks ........................ 38,466.50\n(c) An interest in the estate of her husband ................... 6,900.00\n(d) Real Estate ................... 11,500.00\n(e) Miscellaneous .................. 619.17\n$60,713.48\nAfter making a number of specific bequests and devises in her will, testatrix provided: \u201cWhat is left of the monies I leave to my friend Paula Roseling.\u201d\nThere was a deficiency of assets available to pay (1) the decedent\u2019s debts, and (2) funeral expenses, and (3) the cost of administering her estate without resort to specific legacies and the specific devises.\nThe crucial question involved is whether the gift in the will to Paula Roseling and the gifts in the codicil' \u201cto my executrix\u201d were specific or residuary bequests.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court, in construing Marie Sorschek\u2019s holographic will which expressly disposed of all, her estate, determined (1) that the gift to Paula of \u201cwhat is left of the monies\u201d was a residuary gift, and (2) that (a) six specific bequests of named shares of stock to named relatives, and (b) two pecuniary legacies totaling $1,000 out of her hank deposits to two of her friends, and (c) a gift of her bungalow to her former husband\u2019s brother and wife as a home as long as they live, with remainder to two charities, and (d) gifts of her personal belongings to her named friends and relatives, \u2014 were specific legacies and devises and must abate proportionately, but had priority over residuary gifts.\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court correctly decided that a general residuary bequest or devise must abate before specific legacies and devises. See \u00a7752 of the Fiduciaries Act of 1949 (Act of April 18, 1949, P. L. 512, 20 P.S. \u00a7320.752) which was in effect at the death of testatrix.\nAppellant does not controvert this principle but contends that the word \u201cmonies\u201d in the bequest to her in Marie\u2019s will, viz., \u201cwhat is left of the monies . . .\u201d (a) should be interpreted literally and (b) that it means the balance of the cash in the three bank accounts, namely, $3,227.81, and (c) consequently it was a specific legacy. However, when the testatrix wished to make a specific bequest, or wished a pecuniary bequest to be specifically paid out of her bank accounts, she had said so in her will. For example, she provided, \u201cMy friend Alice Elston shall be given the sum of $500.00 of my bank deposits also to my friend Margaret Wahl the sum of $500.00.\u201d We repeat: We agree with the Orphans\u2019 Court that testatrix intended the bequest of \u201cWhat is left of the monies, **I leave to my friend Paula Roseling\u201d to be a residuary gift and consequently it must abate before the specific legacies and devises.\nThe second question involved is the codicillary gift to her executrix. The codicil pertinently provided: \u201cThe part of his [her husband\u2019s] estate which is coming to me I want to be taken for payment of the various inheritance taxes to my beneficiaries. What is left if any belongs to my executrix\"\nThe difference between Pennsylvania Transfer Inheritance taxes and the part or share of \u201cwhat is coming to\u201d testatrix from her husband\u2019s estate was approximately $720, which would be the amount payable to appellant either as executrix or in her individual capacity. It will be quickly noted that this was a gift not as in the will to Paula Roseling by name but \u201cto my executrix.\u201d\nThe Orphans\u2019 Court decided that \u201cwhat is left if any belongs to my executrix\u201d was a residuary gift> and impliedly held that it was a gift to the executrix in her fiduciary capacity and not to her as an individual: Cf. Sharadin Estate, 154 Pa. Superior Ct. 475, 36 A. 2d 199, but that in either event it must abate before the specific legacies and specific devises. We agree.\nDecree affirmed, costs to be paid out of the principal of the estate.\nTestatrix made no provision in her will for the payment of her debts or funeral or administration expenses, which totaled \u00a77,026.01.\nWhile very few wills have a twin brother, and few wills are controlling of another will, \u201cmonies\u201d generally means cash, but may sometimes include all of testatrix\u2019s residuary property.

Conlin Estate, 388 Pa. 483, 489, 131 A. 2d 117; Lewis Estate, 407 Pa. 518, 521, 180 A. 2d 919; Turner Estate, 408 Pa. 530, 544, 184 A. 2d 896; Bricker\u2019s Estate, 335 Pa. 300, 303, 6 A. 2d 905; Ingham\u2019s Estate, 315 Pa. 293, 295-296, 172 Atl. 662.\nItalics throughout, ours."}
