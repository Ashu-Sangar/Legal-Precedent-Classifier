{"id": "1775333", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nAppellant Carnell Henderson was charged with a brutal assault and rape that occurred in a center-city Philadelphia parking lot. The assailant attacked his victim from behind as she inserted the key into the door of her car. He grabbed her, then spun her around, choked her with one hand and repeatedly struck her with the other. After opening the door, he knocked his victim across the front seat, entered the car and locked the door. She was then pulled upright, seized by the throat, and beaten again. When she tried to escape, the assailant grabbed her and bit her cheek with such force that the scars were still evident at the time of trial. The assailant then took thirty-five dollars from her purse and forced her into the back seat, where he removed her clothes, and still choking her with one hand, raped her. The victim was unable to return to work for a month and bears a permanent scar on her face.\nThe victim identified appellant at a lineup on March 10, 1977, soon after his arrest. He was convicted in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, after jury trial, of rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. Postverdict motions were denied and appellant was sentenced to fifteen to thirty years imprisonment. On direct appeal, the Superior Court affirmed the judgments of sentence in a per curiam order issued May 18,1979. On August 27,1979 this Court granted the appellant\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\nThe first of appellant\u2019s four assignments of error is that he was denied due process of law, equal protection of law, and a jury of his peers because of the Commonwealth\u2019s alleged systematic and deliberate exclusion by peremptory challenge of all black members of appellant\u2019s jury panel. Appellant is black. The venire in this case consisted of thirty-seven persons, five of whom were black. The Commonwealth struck all five black veniremen by use of its peremptory challenges. Appellant objected to the panel because it had so few blacks and moved to form a new panel in which there would be \u201csufficient blacks so the Commonwealth is not able to systematically exclude all blacks with their strikes.\u201d We are asked to rule \u201cthat the use of peremptory challenges to remove prospective jurors on the sole ground of group bias.. . violates the right to trial by a jury drawn from a representative cross-section of the community under both Article I, Section 9 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution.\u201d\nWe observe at the outset that mere underrepresentation of any given group on a jury does not constitute unconstitutional discrimination per se. The United States Supreme Court in Swain v. Alabama, stated:\n[A] defendant in a criminal case is not constitutionally entitled to demand a proportionate number of his race on the jury which tries him nor on the venire or jury roll from which petit jurors are drawn. Virginia v. Rives, 100 U.S. 313, 322-323, 25 L.Ed. 667, 670-671; Gibson v. Mississippi, 162 U.S. 565, 16 S.Ct. 904, 40 L.Ed. 1075; Thomas v. Texas, 212 U.S. 278, 282, 29 S.Ct. 393 [394], 53 L.Ed. 512, 513; Cassell v. Texas, 339 U.S. 282, 70 S.Ct. 629, 94 L.Ed. 839. Neither the jury roll nor the venire need be a perfect mirror of the community or accurately reflect the proportionate strength of every identifiable group. \u201cObviously the number of races and nationalities appearing in the ancestry of our citizens would make it impossible to meet a requirement of proportional representation. Similarly, since there can be no exclusion of Negroes as a race and no discrimination because of color, proportional limitation is not permissible.\u201d Cassell v. Texas, 339 U.S. 282, 286-287, 70 S.Ct. 629 [631], 94 L.Ed. 839, 847 (opinion of Mr. Justice Reed, announcing judgment).\n380 U.S. 202, 208, 85 S.Ct. 824, 829, 13 L.Ed.2d 759 (1965). In the present case, the jurors were chosen from the voter registration rolls. Although there is a bare allegation that Blacks are underrepresented on such rolls, this Court has required that in order to establish that the use of any selection device unconstitutionally fails to reflect a fair cross-section of the community, the challenger must present proof of underrepresentation. Commonwealth v. Martinez, 475 Pa. 331, 334, 380 A.2d 747, 749 (1977). No proof was submitted. Selection of the larger panel from which the petit jury is selected is, therefore, not at issue in this case.\nWhen reduced to its basic elements, appellant\u2019s argument with respect to the jury selection process is that the prosecutor committed constitutional error when he utilized his peremptory challenges to strike black jurors, apparently because he believed that black jurors would tend to be more favorable than white jurors to the black defendant accused of a crime of violence against a white person. This appeal reflects the persistent notion that such prosecutorial use of peremptory challenges is unconstitutional. See Commonwealth v. Futch, 492 Pa. 359, 363-364, 424 A.2d 1231, 1232-1233 (1981); State v. Eames, 365 So.2d 1361, 1367 (La.1978), Annot., \u201cUse of Peremptory Challenge to Exclude from Jury Persons Belonging to a Class or Race,\u201d 79 ALR3d 14 (1975). The United States Supreme Court has spoken to this issue in Swain v. Alabama :\n[Peremptory challenge] is no less frequently exercised on grounds normally thought irrelevant to legal proceedings or official action, namely, the race, religion, nationality, occupation or affiliations of people summoned for jury duty.... Hence veniremen are not always judged solely as individuals for the purpose of exercising peremptory challenges. Rather they are challenged in light of the limited knowledge counsel has of them, which may include their group affiliations, in the context of the case to be tried.\n380 U.S. at 220-221, 85 S.Ct. at 835-836. Put another way, it is not constitutional error for a prosecutor to challenge a black juror for the reason that the prosecutor believes \u2014 validly or invalidly \u2014 that a black venireman because of the facts of the case, is less likely to be impartial than a white venireman. Put still more reductively, the race, creed, national origin, sex or other similar characteristics of a venireman may be proper considerations in exercising peremptory challenges when issues relevant to these qualities are present in the case. The United States Supreme Court has stated:\nIt is permissible to insulate from inquiry the removal of Negroes from a particular jury on the assumption that the prosecutor is acting on acceptable considerations related to the case he is trying, the particular defendant involved and the particular crime charged.\nSwain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. at 223, 85 S.Ct. at 837.\nWe emphatically assert that this Court does not subscribe to any theory concerning the likelihood that one racial group will be biased against another in litigation involving members of both groups. In fact, we strongly suspect that all such theories are no more than mere speculation. But what this Court believes about the viability of theories of racial bias is irrelevant to an analysis of the problem of the proper use of peremptory challenges. Peremptory challenges, historically and by definition, are arbitrary and perhaps even irrational challenges to the seating of a juror. They are totally subjective and not subject to scrutiny or examination. As the United States Supreme Court wrote in Lewis v. United States, 146 U.S. 370, 378, 13 S.Ct. 136, 139, 36 L.Ed. 1011 (1892): \u201c[The peremptory challenge] is, as Blackstone says, an arbitrary and capricious right; and it must be exercised with full freedom, or it fails of its full purpose.\u201d Cited with approval in Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. at 219, 85 S.Ct. at 835. Furthermore, the Court in Swain pointed out that to entertain objections of the nature raised in this case would be to destroy the peremptory nature of the challenge:\nTo subject the prosecutor\u2019s challenge in any particular case to the demands and traditional standards of the Equal Protection Clause would entail a radical change in the nature and operation of the challenge. The challenge, pro tanto, would no longer be peremptory, each and every challenge being open to examination, either at the time of the challenge or at a hearing afterward. The prosecutor\u2019s judgment underlying each challenge would be subject to scrutiny for reasonableness and sincerity. And a great many uses of the challenge would be banned.\nId. at 221-222, 85 S.Ct. at 836-837.\nAs the United States Supreme Court has observed in Swain, peremptory challenges were originally available only to the defendant. In this country, however, the view has been that both sides, defense and prosecution alike, should be able to exercise peremptory challenges. The defendant should be able to strike those thought to be biased against him; the prosecution should be able to strike those thought to be prejudiced against it. Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. at 220, 242 ff, 85 S.Ct. at 835, 847. But this right to peremptory challenge, though it has been described as \u201cone of the most important of the rights secured to the accused,\u201d Pointer v. United States, 151 U.S. 396, 408, 14 S.Ct. 410, 414, 38 L.Ed. 208 (1894), is not constitutionally based.\nThere is nothing in the Constitution of the United States which requires the Congress to grant peremptory challenges to defendants in criminal cases; trial by impartial jury is all that is secured.\nStilson v. United States, 250 U.S. 583, 586, 40 S.Ct. 28, 29, 63 L.Ed. 1154 (1919). The United States Court of Appeals has pointed out,\nsince the right to peremptory challenges is \u201cin the nature of a statutory privilege,. . . [it] may be withheld altogether without impairing the constitutional guaranties of \u2018an impartial jury\u2019 and a fair trial.\u201d Frazier v. United States, 335 U.S. 497, 505, n. 11 [69 S.Ct. 201, 205, 93 L.Ed. 1871 . . . (1948).\nUnited States v. Alessandrello, 637 F.2d 131, 141 n.16 (3rd Cir. 1980).\nTwo other states, California and Massachusetts, responding to constitutional challenges similar to the challenge raised in the present case, have taken positions different from that adopted by the United States Supreme Court in Swain v. Alabama. We have previously noted these cases and summarized their holdings as follows:\nPeople v. Wheeler, involving seven peremptory challenges exercised against black prospective jurors, set forth the following requirements for a prima facie case of discriminatory use of the peremptory challenge:\n\u201cFirst, . . . [the challenger] should make as complete a record of the circumstances as is feasible. Second, he must establish that the persons excluded are members of a cognizable group within the meaning of the representative cross-section rule. Third, from all the circumstances of the case he must show a strong likelihood that such persons are being challenged because of their group association rather than because of any specific bias.\u201d\n22 Cal.3d [258] at 280, 148 Cal.Rptr. [890] at 905, 583 P.2d [748] at 764 (Footnote omitted).\nCommonwealth v. Soares, involving peremptory challenges exercised against 12 of 13 black prospective jurors, articulated a similar standard. It requires a showing that:\n\u201c(1) a pattern of conduct has developed whereby several prospective jurors who have been challenged peremptorily are members of a discrete group, and (2) there is a likelihood they are being excluded from the jury solely by reason of their group membership.\u201d\n[377] Mass. [461] at [490], 387 N.E.2d [499] at 517.\nCommonwealth v. Futch, 492 Pa. 359, 366 n.6, 424 A.2d 1231, 1234, n.6 (1981). For the reasons that follow, we decline to follow the direction taken by California and Massachusetts.\nAlthough peremptory challenges are not constitutionally required, we are reluctant to abolish or otherwise alter a traditional system of jury selection which has, in the main, worked well. Peremptory challenges have been integral to criminal trial procedure for over six hundred years and continue to be used in every jurisdiction in the United States. Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. at 212-219, 85 S.Ct. at 831-835. Furthermore, as is explained by the great Blackstone, there are good reasons for the existence of a system of peremptory challenges:\n[I]n criminal cases, or at least in capital ones, there is, in favorem vitae allowed to the prisoner an arbitrary and capricious species of challenge to a certain number of jurors, without showing any cause at all, which is called a peremptory challenge; a provision full of that tenderness and humanity to prisoners for which our English laws are justly famous. This is grounded on two reasons: 1. As every one must be sensible, what sudden impressions and unaccountable prejudices we are apt to conceive upon the bare looks and gestures of another, and how necessary it is that a prisoner (when put to defend his life) should have a good opinion of his jury, the want of which might totally disconcert him, the law wills not that he should be tried by any one man against whom he has conceived a prejudice, even without being able to assign a reason for such his dislike. 2. Because, upon challenges for cause shown, if the reason assigned prove insufficient to set aside the juror, perhaps the bare questioning bis indifference may sometimes provoke a resentment; to prevent all ill consequences from which, the prisoner is still at liberty, if he pleases, peremptorily to set him aside.\n4 Blackstone, Commentaries, 353 (New York, 1859). Since it is our view that both the defendant and the prosecution should be able to be reasonably assured that the jury before whom they will appear will be fair and impartial \u2014 an assurance implemented by the right to exercise peremptory challenges \u2014 we decline to curtail or disturb either the prosecutorial or the defense right to peremptory challenges.\nFinally, we decline to follow the approach taken by California and Massachusetts because the protections they have devised against abuse of the exercise of peremptory challenges are illusory. Both states, ultimately, require a showing that persons are challenged, in California, \u201cbecause of their group association rather than because of any specific bias,\u201d and in Massachusetts because \u201cthere is a likelihood they are being excluded from the jury solely by reason of their group membership.\u201d It will be recalled that under Swain v. Alabama, supra, it is permissible to challenge a venireman peremptorily because of his race or religion or supposed group affiliation so long as there is reason to believe that the race, religion or supposed group affiliation is related to a significant issue in the case. 380 U.S. at 221, 85 S.Ct. at 836. A prosecutor\u2019s response to an objection to peremptory challenge of black veniremen in California and Massachusetts, therefore, need be only that in the prosecutor\u2019s judgment, the race of the venireman is related to the venireman\u2019s ability to be impartial in the case. This idea has been considerably expanded in a recent article concerning the ease with which the California and Massachusetts approaches can be circumvented by prosecutors who merely articulate reasons for their challenges. Articulated reasons may be:\nNot, \u201cI\u2019m excusing all blacks, may it please the court, because they\u2019re black.\u201d Of course not. Rather, \u201cI\u2019m excusing blacks, your honor, because I have a hunch . . . that blacks will be prejudiced against the prosecution in this case.\u201d Or, \u201cOne of the prosecution witnesses is prejudiced against blacks, which will be obvious to black jurors, your honor, who therefore ought to be excused.\u201d Or, \u201cThe testimony in this case may refer to race in a way insulting to black people.\u201d Or, \u201cMy sense of how a jury will look at this case is that black jurors will differ with white jurors and vice versa, and, your honor, I want to avoid a hung jury.\u201d Et cetera. There comes a point, in sum, when the fluency and rationalizing powers of a lawyer overcome any burden the Wheeler-Soares rule may place upon prosecutors to justify their peremptory chailenges. At that point, for all practical purposes the Wheeler-Soares rule ceases to exist.\n7 Litigation (Fall 1980), at 56. We agree that the WheelerSoares rule is unworkable. Further, we agree that the peremptory challenge is \u201cone of the most important of the rights secured to the accused,\u201d Pointer v. United States, supra, and we decline to limit that right, either as to the prosecution or the defense. Both parties have a legitimate and significant interest in feeling as secure as reasonably possible that the jury before whom they appear will be impartial. Peremptory challenges are important to the realization of this interest. Because of these considerations, we conclude that the test for racial discrimination in the use of peremptory challenges set out in Swain v. Alabama is the proper one:\n[W]hen the prosecutor in a county, in case after case, whatever the circumstances, whatever the crime and whoever the defendant or the victim may be, is responsible for the removal of Negroes who have been selected as qualified jurors by the jury commissioners and who have survived challenges for cause, with the result that no Negroes ever serve on petit juries, the Fourteenth Amendment claim takes on added significance. ... In these circumstances, giving even the widest leeway to the operation of irrational but trial-related suspicions and antagonisms, it would appear that the purposes of the peremptory challenge are being perverted.\n380 U.S. 223-224, 85 S.Ct. at 837-838.\nTo hold otherwise would be to destroy the peremptory challenge and to deny, implicitly, the validity of the reasons for having such a device in the first place. We reject this result.\nAppellant next claims that the lower court erred in refusing to suppress an out-of-court lineup identification as unconstitutionally suggestive in that none of the other men in the lineup matched all of his physical characteristics. The victim observed her assailant constantly and at close range throughout the attack, which lasted nearly a half hour. Afterwards, she gave police a detailed description of the assailant\u2019s height, weight, build, and clothing that matched the defendant. Upon viewing the lineup composed of eight men of similar age and build, the victim recognized and identified the appellant as the man who beat and raped her. After viewing photographic slides of the lineup array, and hearing testimony from the victim and officers present at the identification, the suppression judge ruled that the lineup was fair and denied the appellant\u2019s motion to suppress. Because the hearing court\u2019s ruling is supported by the record, the admission into evidence at trial of the identification of the defendant at the lineup may not now be disturbed. See Commonwealth v. Sparrow, 471 Pa. 490, 370 A.2d 712 (1977); Commonwealth v. Wilcox, 481 Pa. 284, 392 A.2d 1294 (1978). The purpose of a lineup is to effect a fair and accurate identification, not to present the victim with a group of indistinguishable clones.\nAppellant\u2019s third allegation of error is that the trial court erred in ruling that appellant\u2019s prior convictions for theft and robbery were admissible to impeach his credibility, should he testify at trial. The appellant concedes that had he testified, he would have merely denied guilt; he does not claim that he would have proffered any other defense, such as alibi or consent. Moreover, the prosecutor had no basis for cross-examination or impeachment of this testimony but the convictions for crimen falsi, which would of course be probative of the defendant\u2019s credibility and relevant to the jury\u2019s determination of a \u201cswearing contest\u201d between the defendant and his victim.\nIn Commonwealth v. Roots this Court articulated five basic considerations the trial court must balance in determining whether evidence of prior crimes should be admitted for the limited purpose of impeaching the defendant\u2019s credibility and veracity:\n1) the degree to which the commission of the prior offense reflects upon the veracity of the defendant-witness;\n2) the likelihood, in view of the nature and extent of the prior record, that it would have a greater tendency to smear the character of the defendant and suggest a propensity to commit the crime for which he stands charged, rather than provide a legitimate reason for discrediting him as an untruthful person;\n3) the age and circumstances of the defendant;\n4) the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case and the prosecution\u2019s need to resort to this evidence as compared with the availability to the defense of other witnesses through which its version of the events surrounding the incident can be presented; and\n5) the existence of alternative means of attacking the defendant\u2019s credibility.\n482 Pa. 33, 39-40, 393 A.2d 364, 367 (1978).\nA point-by-point consideration of these five factors establishes the propriety of the trial court\u2019s ruling:\n1) The prior convictions, two for theft and one for robbery, were for crimen falsi and thus highly pertinent to veracity and credibility. Commonwealth v. Perrin, 484 Pa. 188, 195, 398 A.2d 1007, 1001 (1975). The convictions, secured between 1974 and 1976, were recent, and their relevance not attenuated by age. See Commonwealth v. Green, 477 Pa. 170, 179, 383 A.2d 877, 882 (1978).\n2) The convictions for such crimes of falsehood and deceit could not be reasonably said to invite the jurors to convict the defendant of a brutal sexual attack because of his character or propensity to rape.\n3) Appellant was a twenty-one year old adult at the time of trial.\n4) The prosecution\u2019s case depended solely upon the testimony of the victim and her identification of the appellant as the rapist. The accuracy of that identification was attacked through vigorous cross-examination, including attempts to show that the victim had made prior inconsistent statements, by defense witnesses who testified to the circumstances surrounding the lineup, and by argument to the jury that the identification procedures were suggestive. Through cross-examination and his own witnesses, the appellant presented his full case to the jury; his purported testimony would have added nothing to his central argument that the identification was erroneous, and would have only placed his credibility, versus that of the victim, before the jury. Indeed, the appellant\u2019s claim of innocence was fully presented to the jurors by his pleas of not guilty.\n5) The Commonwealth had no alternative means of attacking the appellant\u2019s credibility, or of cross-examining him upon his mere denial of guilt.\nBecause the trial court\u2019s ruling allowing impeachment was a sound exercise of discretion based on a proper balancing of the competing considerations appellant\u2019s claim is rejected.\nAppellant\u2019s final claim is that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the identification testimony must be considered with caution in light of the suggestiveness of the lineup and the emotional state of the victim. In that portion of his charge governing the jury\u2019s evaluation of identification evidence, the trial judge instructed as follows:\nNow, members of the jury, there has been some testimony in this case, and a very integral part of the case relative to the identification of the defendant as the perpetrator of the crime.\nThere are certain tests the jury is to apply to the testimony on identification. I want to go over those tests that the law has set out for you.\nIf you believe, members of the jury, that the witness was not, was not in a position to clearly observe the assailant, if you believe that, or if you believe that the witness is not positive as to the identity, or if you believe that the positive statements as to identity were weakened by qualification or by failure to identify the defendant on one or more prior occasions and that the accuracy of the identification then is so doubtful then that testimony as to identity must be received with caution.\nOn the other hand, however, if you believe that the opportunity for positive identification was good, if you believe that, and that the witness is positive in their identification and that the identification is not weakened, not weakened by prior failure to identify but remains, even after cross-examination positive and unqualified, if you believe that, then the testimony as to identification need not be received with caution and the witness\u2019 testimony, under those circumstances as to identity may be treated by you as a statement of fact.\nThis Court has long held that the above-quoted instruction is a proper and sufficient statement of the law, and one that provides full and fair guidance for the jury\u2019s assessment of the weight to be accorded identification testimony. Commonwealth v. Kloiber, 378 Pa. 412, 106 A.2d 820 (1954). See also Commonwealth v. Pitts, 450 Pa. 359, 301 A.2d 646 (1973). As appellant notes in his brief, a trial judge must \u201cilluminate all relevant legal issues for the jury\u201d in his charge. Commonwealth v. Moore, 463 Pa. 317, 323, 344 A.2d 850, 853 (1975). By specifically focusing the jurors\u2019 attention upon the victim\u2019s opportunity to observe her assailant, upon the force of her identification of appellant, and upon any qualifications or inconsistencies in that identification before or during trial, the court met that duty and insured to the appellant a fair jury evaluation of the reliability of the victim\u2019s identification and of the full range of arguments presented by counsel in summation. There was no error in the court\u2019s charge or in refusing to modify the charge as requested by appellant.\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.\nROBERTS and NIX, JJ., filed dissenting opinions.\nSee also the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Richardson in People v. Wheeler, 148 Cal.Rptr. 890 at 914, 583 P.2d 748 at 772 (1978)."}
