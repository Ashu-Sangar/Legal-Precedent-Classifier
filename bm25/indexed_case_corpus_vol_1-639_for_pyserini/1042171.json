{"id": "1042171", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe court below was fully justified in entering judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense in this case for the amount for which judgment was claimed. There was no sufficient denial of the claim of plaintiff that the defendant collected upon its account, and failed to pay over to it, the sums of money in question.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
