{"id": "829919", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Mitchell,\nThe first clause of the lease creates a term for one year, and if there were nothing further upon the term appellant would clearly be right in its contention that its liability for rent ceased with the year. But the subsequent clause numbered seven must be construed together with the first, and as part of the language of the parties defining the term created. Clause seven begins: \u201c From and after the expiration of the term hereby created, this lease shall be deemed to be renewed, and in force for another year.\u201d If it had stopped here it would have been a covenant absolute for a second year, but it continues, \u201c and so on from year to year,\u201d which is a short mode of repeating the previous sentence indefinitely. Written out in full it would be, \u201c and from and after the expiration of the second term hereby created, this lease shall be deemed to be renewed and in force for another year,\u201d and again repeating the same language for a fourth, a fifth, and as many years as the parties chose to specify, each sentence of the kind being still a covenant absolute for another year. That it should be a covenant absolute and indefinite was not, however, the intention of the parties, and so they added the condition of defeasance, \u201c unless either party shall have given to the other notice of its intention to determine said tenancy sixty days prior to the expiration of any current year.\u201d If the condition of defeasance had come immediately after the first covenant for renewal, the necessity of notice to avoid the operation of the covenant would have been beyond question, and the fact that there is interposed between the phrase \u201c and so on from year to year,\u201d is, as already shown, no more than the equivalent of an indefinite number of repetitions of the first covenant in totidem verbis. Grammatically the condition of defeasance is applicable to all the prior clauses of the sentence, and there is nothing to indicate the intention of the parties to restrict such application. If it was not so applicable, then the covenant was absolute for a second year, as already seen.\nAnother illustration leads us to the same result. If the condition be transposed to the head of the sentence, so as to read \u201c unless either party shall have given notice .... this lease shall be deemed to be renewed and in force for another year, and so on from year to year,\u201d the meaning of the sentence as a whole would not be in anywise changed, and yet the application of the notice to the first term would be unquestionable.\nIf there were any doubt as to the meaning of the parties from the language they have adopted, it would be set at rest by the language they have deliberately rejected. The lease is a printed form, and the blank contained, as clause seven, the following: \u201c If the lessee shall hold over after the expiration of the term hereby created, with the consent of the lessor, it shall be held and taken to be a renewal .... and so on until either party shall give previous notice,\u201d etc. If we substitute for \u201c hold over \u201d the equivalent phrase \u201c continue on the premises,\u201d this is substantially the language of the lease in MacGregor v. Rawle, 57 Pa. 184, which this court held not to require notice at the end of the first year. With this printed clause before them, having a meaning thus judicially established, as not requiring notice at the end of the first year, the parties struck it out, and wrote in its place the clause as we now have it, not that \u201cif the lessee shall hold over,\u201d but that \u201cfrom and after the expiration of the term .... this lease shall be deemed to be renewed .... unless \u201d notice shall have been given. Such action seems to show conclusively their intent that notice should be necessary at the end of the first as well as of the succeeding years.\nIf the sixth clause, providing for a peaceable delivery of the premises. by the lessee at the expiration \u201c of the said term,\u201d were repugnant to the seventh, it would have to give way, as the written clause is presumed to express the meaning of the parties more exactly than the printed: Grandin v. Ins. Co., 107 Pa.,26; Duffield v. Hue, 129 Pa. 94, 108; Dick v. Ireland, 130 Pa. 299. But there is no real repugnance. \u201cThe said term\u201d in the sixth clause means, not merely the first year, but the whole term held under the lease, whether one year under the first clause, or several under the seventh. It is at the end .of the tenancy, whenever by the terms of the whole lease it does end, that the lessee is to surrender the possession.\nThe learned judge was a little incautious in affirming plaintiff\u2019s second point with the remark that the payment of the first month\u2019s rent for the new year was an affirmance of the lease for such year. It was evidence of affirmance, but was open to explanation to show that such was not the actual intention. The error, however, did appellants no harm. They were liable on the terms of the lease and the admitted facts, and none of the evidence offered and excluded would have varied their liability.\nJudgment affirmed."}
