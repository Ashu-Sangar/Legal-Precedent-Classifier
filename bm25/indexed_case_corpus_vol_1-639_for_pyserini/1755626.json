The Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Commissioner of the Bureau of Elections, Commissions and Legislations of the Commonwealth are directed to notify the County Boards of Election throughout the Commonwealth and every other party entitled to notice that, in the primary election of 1979, each political party may nominate two candidates for the office of judge of the Commonwealth Court and that, in the primary election of 1979 and in the municipal election of 1979, each elector may vote for two persons or candidates for the offices to be filled.\nLeave is granted to any person who filed nomination papers for the office of judge of the Commonwealth Court to withdraw said papers by 5:00 p. m. on April 10, 1979, and the Secretary of the Commonwealth is directed to accept any such withdrawals within the stated period.\nOpinions to follow.\nNIX, J., dissents and would hold that 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) is unconstitutional.\nLARSEN, J., dissents.\nOPINION OF THE COURT\nEAGEN, Chief Justice.\nPursuant to 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 726 (1978), we assumed extraordinary jurisdiction of the above captioned petitions for review filed in the Commonwealth Court. Oral argument was presented by petitioners, respondents and, by leave of Court, Amicus Curiae. The substantive issues presented involve the proper application of 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) to the primary and municipal elections of 1979 and the constitutionality of that statute.\n42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) provides:\n\u201cWhenever two or more judges of the Commonwealth Court are to be elected pursuant to 3131(c) (relating to selection of judicial officers for regular terms) at the same election, each qualified elector shall vote for no more than:\n(1) one-half of the number of judges to be elected, if the total number to be elected is even; or\n(2) the smallest number constituting a majority of the total number of judges to be elected, if the total number to be elected is odd.\n\u201cThe persons having the highest number of votes, up to the total number of judges to be elected, shall be elected.\u201d\nThe total number of judges to be elected to the Commonwealth Court pursuant to 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3131(c)(1978) in the 1979 municipal election is three. See Abraham v. Shapp, 484 Pa. 573, 400 A.2d 1249 (1979) and order dated February 8, 1979 in cited case, No. 1 E.D. Misc. Dkt. 1979. Respondent, Secretary of the Commonwealth, following the filing of the cited order and pursuant to 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978), notified the county boards of election that each political party was to nominate two candidates for the three judicial offices of the Commonwealth Court to be filled in the municipal election and that each elector was to vote for two candidates in the municipal election. In response to that notification, petitioner, Dennis E. Thiemann, filed a petition for review challenging the constitutionality of 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978). The Secretary, upon the advice of the Attorney General, then revised her interpretation and notified the State chairperson of each of the two major political parties in the Commonwealth that her interpretation of 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) as revised would result in each elector being permitted to vote for three persons in the primary with each political party nominating three candidates. This notification did not alter the Secretary\u2019s earlier directive that in the municipal election each elector could vote for no more than two candidates to fill the three offices. The Secretary stands ready to notify the county boards of election of the revised interpretation, but has refrained from doing so pending the outcome of this action. Petitioner, David W. Craig, a judge of the Commonwealth Court who has filed nomination petitions, then filed a petition for review seeking alternative rulings, viz. that each party may nominate three candidates in the primary and each elector may vote for three candidates in the municipal election if the statute is declared unconstitutional or that each party may nominate two candidates and each elector may vote for two candidates in the municipal election if the statute is upheld. Amicus Curiae argues that the statute is constitutional; that each party may nominate two candidates; and, that each elector may vote for two candidates in the municipal election.\nAt the outset we are required to construe 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978). The clear and unambiguous language thereof mandates an interpretation which allows each elector to vote for two persons in the 1979 primary and each elector to vote for two candidates in the 1979 municipal election.\n1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a) (Supp. 1978-79) provides that the \u201cobject of interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly,\u201d and (b) provides:\n\u201c[w]hen the words of the statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d\nClearly, 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) limits an elector to voting for two persons when three judges of the Commonwealth Court are \u201cto be elected pursuant to 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3131(c) ... at the same election.\u201d\nThe Secretary\u2019s interpretation would confine the term \u201celection\u201d to the municipal election and, hence, result in the statute being inapplicable to the primary. 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 and \u00a7 3131(c) (1978) must be read in pari materia with the provisions of the Election Code, 25 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2601 et seq., because each \u201crelate[s] to the same . . . things or to the same class of things.\u201d 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1932(a) (Supp. 1978-79); City of York v. Reihart, 475 Pa. 151, 379 A.2d 1328 (1977). Furthermore, when statutes are in pari materia, they must \u201cbe construed together, if possible, as one statute,\u201d 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1932(b) (Supp. 1978-79); Commonwealth v. Philadelphia Electric Co., 472 Pa. 530, 372 A.2d 815 (1977), and \u201c[e]very statute [must] be construed, if possible, to give effect to all its provisions.\u201d 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(a) (Supp. 1978-79); City of York v. Reihart, supra; Appeal of Neshaminy Auto Villa LTD., 25 Pa.Cmwlth. 129, 358 A.2d 433 (1976).\n25 P.S. \u00a7 2602(f) defines election as \u201cany general, municipal, special or primary election, unless otherwise specified.\u201d Hence, \u201celection\u201d under 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) includes a primary election because it does not otherwise specify.\nThe Secretary argues the statute refers to an election in which judges are \u201cto be elected\u201d and, hence, does not apply to primary elections because in that process judges are not elected, rather persons are nominated as candidates, citing 25 P.S. \u00a7 2602(r). The argument is only technically plausible.\nFirst, the term \u201cto be-elected\u201d in the first part of 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) does not appear to be used to limit the term \u201celection.\u201d Clearly, had the Legislature intended to limit the term election to \u201cmunicipal election,\u201d it could easily have done so since the latter term is already defined at 25 P.S. \u00a7 2602(j). This, the Legislature did not do.\nSecond, the last sentence of 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) indicates those who shall ultimately be \u00e9leeted, but does not limit the first sentence.\nThird, were we to accept the Secretary\u2019s position, we would, as a practical matter, be compelled to conclude the Legislature has impliedly abolished straight party voting as provided for at 25 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2963(f) and 3007(b). There is no indication in 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) that any such result was intended, and we must give effect to all legislative pronouncements if possible, 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1922(2) (Supp. 1978-79), and find an implied repealer only if the statutes are irreconcilable. 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1932 and 1936 (Supp. 1978-79); City of York v. Reihart, supra; Appeal of Yerger, 460 Pa. 537, 333 A.2d 902 (1975). Our interpretation reconciles the statutes by allowing for both limited voting and straight party voting. Hence, we give effect to both provisions and do not find an implied repealer.\nThus, we conclude 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) is clear and unambiguous and by its terms applies to the primary, as well as the municipal, election. Our interpretation is fortified by a study of the history of limited voting in the Commonwealth.\nThe primary election process determines the candidates of each party for the municipal or general election. 25 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2602(k), 2602(r); 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1991 (Supp. 1978-79). Historically, when limited voting applied, a party, whether through the primary election process or through some other means, nominated only as many candidates as an elector was allowed to vote for in the general or municipal election. Musmanno v. Lawrence, supra at 99-100. The General Assembly was aware of this practice when it adopted 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978), and we must afford considerable deference to that awareness. 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(c)(7) (Supp. 1978-79). Since historically the number of candidates each political party nominated under such circumstances was limited to the number an elector could vote for in the general or municipal election, the Legislature must have intended limited voting to apply to the primary. In light of this historical approach to limited voting, the Legislature in enacting 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) surely did not intend to allow the nomination of more candidates in the primary than each elector could vote for in the general or municipal election.. At a minimum, had such a deviation from historical practice been intended, we do not believe the Legislature would have attempted that deviation in such an uncertain manner.\nAlso, an election was held in 1973; it was governed in part by the Act of January 6, 1970, P.L. (1969) 434, \u00a7 3, as amended, December 29, 1972, P.L. 1724, No. 371 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2, 17 P.S. \u00a7 211.3(i) (Supp. 1978-79); that Act is substantially identical to 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978); and, the 1973 election was conducted in the precise manner in which we now interpret 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978). Surely, reenactment by the Legislature of substantially the same provision in 1978 indicates an intent to conduct elections in the same manner as in 1973. See 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(c)(7) (Supp. 1978-79).\nFinally, the constitutional and statutory provisions providing for limited voting for county commissioners are similar to 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) and have been implemented in the same manner as we now interpret 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) for many years. See Pa. Const. art. 14, \u00a7 7 (1874) (amended 1909) (repealed 1968); Pa. Const. art. 9, \u00a7 4 (1968); Act of August 9, 1955, P.L. 323, \u00a7 501, 16 P.S. \u00a7 501 (1956); Act of May 2, 1929, P.L. 1278, No. 446, art. III, \u00a7 101 (repealed).\nThe Secretary argues our interpretation creates a \u201cvery real possibility\u201d that the same two persons will receive all nominations and, hence, the names of only two persons will appear on the municipal election ballot when three offices are to be filled. While we acknowledge this possibility exists, we must conclude this legislative oversight does not compel an interpretation different from the clear words of the statute. Moreover, this interpretation will not interfere with the 1979 municipal election determining the three persons who are to fill the judicial positions. If the same individuals win all nominations, the elector is free to reject one or both of the nominees and to \u201cwrite in\u201d the name of another or the names of other persons, and, by this process, the third office can be filled in the municipal election. Cf. Wasson v. Woods, 265 Pa. 442, 109 A. 214 (1919). The right of the elector to select the person to occupy public office is the foundation of the election process, not the right to appear on the ballot. Cf. Abraham v. Shapp, supra; Wasson v. Woods, supra.\nPetitioner, Thiemann, attacks 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) as violative of the Constitution if it \u201climits\u201d voting. Since our interpretation does \u201climit\u201d voting, we shall consider the arguments advanced relative to this.\nInitially, we note that \u201c[c]ourts may not declare a statute unconstitutional \u2018unless it clearly, palpably and plainly violates the Constitution.\u2019 \u201d [Emphasis in original.] Tosto v. Penn. Nurs. Home Loan Agcy., 460 Pa. 1, 16, 331 A.2d 198, 205 (1975) quoting Daly v. Hemphill, 411 Pa. 263, 271, 191 A.2d 835, 840 (1963).\nPetitioner, Thiemann, concedes limited voting has historically been an integral part of the election process in the Commonwealth. More particularly, he concedes such a method of election is permissible when mandated by the Constitution as in Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 16 (1874) (mandating limited voting for the office of justice of the Supreme Court \u2014 repealed 1968) and when mandated by the Legislature in certain circumstances as in the Act of June 24, 1895, P.L. 212, No. 128, \u00a7 1 (mandating limited voting for judges of the Superior Court). See Commonwealth ex rel. McCormick v. Reeder, 171 Pa. 505, 33 A. 67 (1895) [Hereinafter: McCormick]. But he argues the Constitution impliedly prohibits limited voting in an election for judicial positions on the Commonwealth Court. Petitioner reasons: (1) that constitutionally created offices may, indeed must, be filled by elections utilizing limited voting when provided for in the Constitution as in Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 16 (1873) (repealed 1968); (2) that, in the case of a statewide court statutorily created, the Legislature has discretion to choose the method of selection, including limited voting, see McCormick; but (3) that, in the case of a constitutionally created court such as the Commonwealth Court, where no provision in the Constitution mandates limited voting, the Legislature is impliedly prohibited from mandating limited voting. Hence, petitioner urges our ruling in McCormick is inapposite here because in that case the office was statutorily created and instantly the office is constitutionally created.\nWith this we do not agree. McCormick makes no such distinction.\nThe Superior Court was created pursuant to Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 1 (1874) (repealed 1968 \u2014 in pertinent part restored as Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 1 (1968)) which provided the General Assembly with authority to establish other courts. The method of selecting judges for such statutorily created courts was not governed by Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 15 (1874) (amended 1965 \u2014 repealed 1968 \u2014 similar provision restored as Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 13 (1968)) which provided: \u201cAll judges . shall be elected by the qualified electors of the respective districts over which they are to preside . . . \u201d because the Superior Court was to serve statewide, not in districts. Hence, in McCormick, supra, 171 Pa. at 515, 33 A. at 68, we said Pa. Const. art. 12, \u00a7 1(1874) (amended 1909) (renumbered art. 6, \u00a7 1 (1966)), which provided: \u201cAll officers whose selection is not provided for in this constitution shall be elected or appointed as may be directed by law,\u201d governed the method of selection. We did not then reason that, since the Legislature could have provided for the judges to be selected by appointment or election, an election involving limited voting was really a method of appointment by the electorate which satisfied the mandate of Pa. Const. art. 12, \u00a7 1 (1874). Nor did we reason that the constitutional term election within Pa. Const. art. 12, \u00a7 1 (1874) differed from that term as used in other portions of the Constitution because of the choice between methods of selection given to the Legislature by Pa. Const. art. 12, \u00a7 1 (1874). Had we done so, McCormick could be used to support the distinction petitioner advances. But this, we did not do.\nWe said:\n\u201cWithout regard to what the legislature might have done to fill the offices created by the establishment of the Superior Court, whether they might or might not have made the office appointive, all these questions are now unimportant and we pass no opinion upon them; the court is established; the office is made elective to be filled by the candidates elected at the general election.\u201d\nMcCormick, supra, 171 Pa. at 516, 33 A. at 69. Clearly, we viewed the issue in McCormick as whether, when an election is required either constitutionally or statutorily pursuant to a legislative choice of alternatives allowed by the Constitution, the Legislature as the representative of the will of the people, Sharpless v. Mayor of Philadelphia, 21 Pa. 147 (1853), may mandate limited voting in an election, and to this we responded affirmatively. In essence, we reasoned that the Legislature chose the election process of the Constitution and specifically that of Pa. Const. art. 12, \u00a7 1 (1874) to fill the judgeships involved and that limited voting was not a constitutionally impermissible limitation on the right of an elector to participate in the election. Finally, we reasoned Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 16 (1874) mandating limited voting in elections for the office of justice of the Supreme Court and similar constitutional provisions applicable to other offices did not warrant application of the maxim expressio unius exclusio est alterius. Hence, McCormick clearly stands for the proposition that, where a judicial election is required by a statute, by a statute choosing between constitutionally allowable alternatives, or by the Constitution, the Legislature in its discretion may impose limited voting in specific instances.\nThe provisions of the Constitution of 1968 do not compel either a different analysis or result.\nPa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 13(a)(1968) mandates the election of Commonwealth Court judges, see Abraham v. Shapp, supra, and, as explained, no reason exists to distinguish between an election held pursuant to that provision and an election held pursuant to a legislative choice allowed by the Constitution as with Pa. Const. art. 12, \u00a7 1 (1874), or for that matter an election mandated purely by statute. Petitioner\u2019s reasoning that the deletion in 1968 of Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 16 (1874), providing for limited voting in elections for the office of justice of the Supreme Court, shows an intent to create an implied prohibition against limited voting is predicated upon his view of McCormick. But, as has been shown, when McCormick is analyzed properly, the repeal of Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 16 (1874) indicates an intention to leave the method of election under Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 13(a)(1968) to the discretion of the Legislature, i. e. it indicates an intention to remove the constitutional mandate as to the Supreme Court, and the method of election may constitutionally include limited voting. Given the language in McCormick specifically indicating we were dealing with a legislatively chosen election as allowed by Pa. Const. art. 12, \u00a7 1 (1874) and, hence, with an election within the terms of the Constitution, and given our ruling that no implied prohibition existed, as well as the dissenting opinion on precisely that point, the delegates to the 1967-68 Constitutional Convention must have known only an express prohibition could remove the legislative discretion expressly recognized in McCormick and could hardly be deemed to have intended an implied prohibition by repealing Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 16 (1874). Certainly, had such been intended, McCormick would at least have compelled greater clarity.\nTo the extent petitioner\u2019s argument for an implied prohibition is based on the reasoning that Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 13(a)(1968) requires an election and limited voting interferes with the rights of an elector, McCormick clearly rejected such reasoning. To the extent petitioner\u2019s position is based upon Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 13(a)(1968) mandating an election, no implied prohibition can arise from this provision because an election involving limited voting satisfies the provision\u2019s mandate. Limited voting in an election was held in McCormick to be an adequate method of satisfying a. statutorily mandated election and the election was constitutional in scope because the statute merely chose the election process allowed by Pa. Const. art. 12, \u00a7 1 (1874). No reason has been advanced to distinguish between the term election in Pa. Const. art. 12, \u00a7 1 (1874) and in Pa. Const. art. 5, \u00a7 13(a), and we know of none. The former provision required a process of election once the legislative choice was made, McCormick, and the latter requires a process of election. In each instance, limited voting in the process satisfies the mandate.\nPetitioner, Thiemann, argues that, since judicial candidates may cross-file, see 25 P.S. \u00a7 2870, the purpose of limited voting is \u201cdiminishfed], if not eliminated\u201d and that we should strike down 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1968) for that reason. But petitioner concedes the purpose of the statute is not to insure minority representation, but to encourage it; without doubt, even if the effectiveness is diminished by cross-filing, the statute does have a purpose and to some extent advances that purpose, i. e., it encourages minority representation. Cf. Commonwealth ex rel. Teller v. Jennings, 409 Pa. 513, 186 A.2d 916 (1963).\nFinally, petitioner argues there is absolutely no justification in having limited voting \u201capplicable only to the Commonwealth Court.\u201d We shall not dwell on this argument; suffice it to say the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Court differs from other courts and the Legislature may have determined a minority voice in the subject matter area of that court\u2019s jurisdiction is more important than elsewhere.\nFor the reasons stated heretofore, we have previously issued the following:\nAND NOW, TO WIT, this 3rd day of April, 1979, 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) is ruled constitutional. The Secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the Commissioner of the Bureau of Elections, Commissions and Legislations of the Commonwealth are directed to notify the County Boards of Election throughout the Commonwealth and every other party entitled to notice that, in the primary election of 1979, each political party may nominate two candidates for the office of judge of the Commonwealth Court and that, in the primary election of 1979 and in the municipal election of 1979, each elector may vote for two persons or candidates for the offices to be filled.\nLeave is granted to any person who filed nomination papers for the office of judge of the Commonwealth Court to withdraw said papers by 5:00 p. m. on April 10, 1979, and the Secretary of the Commonwealth is directed to accept any such withdrawals within the stated period.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion in which LARSEN, J., joins.\nLARSEN, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. The Pennsylvania Election Code, Act of June 3, 1937, P.L. 1333, art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 101 et seq., 25 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2601 et seq. [hereinafter: 25 P.S. \u00a7 -] defines a \u201cprimary election\u201d at 25 P.S. \u00a7 2602(r) as \u201cany election held for the purpose of . nominating candidates for public offices to be voted for at an election.\u201d\n. A \u201cmunicipal election\u201d is defined at 25 P.S. \u00a7 2602(j) as the constitutionally mandated election held in \u201codd-numbered years\u201d as opposed to a \u201cgeneral election\u201d which is held in \u201ceven-numbered years.\u201d 25 P.S. \u00a7 2602(h).\n. We say as a practical matter because theoretically the paper ballots and voting machines might be prepared in such a way as to reflect three straight party tickets for each party so that, by using one of the three, an elector could vote a straight ticket and still only choose two of the three candidates for Commonwealth Court judge on a party\u2019s ticket. For example, if A, B, and C were nominated by party Z, ballot 1 for party Z could include A and B, ballot 2-B and C, and ballot 3-A and C. But we believe such a result would be absurd, and, hence, to interpret 42 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 3133 (1978) in this manner would violate the legislative mandate of 1 Pa. C.S.A. \u00a7 1922(1) (Supp. 1978-79). Also, no legislative authority exists to allow for three different straight party tickets for each party. See Musmanno v. Lawrence, 24 Pa.D & C. 93 (Dauphin 1935) (the court sitting as what is now the Commonwealth Court).\n. The primary election process is merely a statutorily provided procedure by which parties choose nominees which replaced other methods such as conventions, caucuses, and popular vote governed by officials appointed or selected by party rules. Winston v. Moore, 244 Pa. 447, 91 A. 520 (1914).\n. This possibility exists because judicial candidates may file for nominations by their own party and other parties. 25 P.S. \u00a7 2870.\n. The wisdom of this process is not a matter with which we need concern ourselves; that is a legislative concern. The possibility that no elector would \u201cwrite-in\u201d anyone presents no greater problem than if no elector voted for any of a multitude of candidates for the same office even though names appeared on the ballot.\n. We did not distinguish the term \u201celection\u201d in Pa. Const. art. 12, \u00a7 1 (1874) from the use of that term elsewhere in the Constitution, that is, we did not say different criteria are used to determine if an election requirement is met where the source of the requirement is a statutory mandate pursuant to a choice allowed by the Constitution, than where the source of the requirement is a constitutional mandate.\n. Indeed, Mr. Justice Williams filed a dissenting opinion joined by Mr. Justice Sterrett in which he expressly disagreed with the majority as to this.\n. We have examined the Debates of the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention of 1967-68 and have found nothing to evidence the intent attributed by petitioner to the delegates, nor has any portion of the debates been brought to our attention to support such a view."}
