{"id": "920349", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe record shows a possible outstanding title under McElhenny or Miller. But it is a bare and rather remote possibility, not sufficient to make a title under possession for seventy-two years so doubtful as to be unmarketable. We therefore dismiss the assignments and affirm the decree entered by the learned court below.\nJudgment affirmed."}
