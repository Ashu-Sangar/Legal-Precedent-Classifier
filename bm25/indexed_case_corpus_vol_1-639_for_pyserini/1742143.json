{"id": "1742143", "contents": "OPINION\nPER CURIAM.\nThis case was originally before this Court on direct appeal at which time we affirmed appellant\u2019s convictions of murder of the first degree and conspiracy. Commonwealth v. Farquharson, 467 Pa. 50, 354 A.2d 545 (1976). This is an appeal from the Post Conviction Hearing Act court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s request for a new trial based on a Commonwealth witness\u2019s recantation testimony. We find no abuse of discretion in the lower court\u2019s refusal to believe the recantation testimony and, therefore, affirm that court\u2019s order denying a new trial.\nOrder affirmed.\nPACKEL, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a dissenting opinion, in which ROBERTS, J., joined."}
