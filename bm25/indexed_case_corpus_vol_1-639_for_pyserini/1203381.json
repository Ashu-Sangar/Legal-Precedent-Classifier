{"id": "1203381", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Maxey,\nThis appeal involves the interpretation of the following paragraph in the will of Anna M. Bayard, who died on January 10, 1890: \u201c4th. I request that $500.00 a year be given to my niece Mary Bayard Henry during her life. Should she marry let it be strictly settled on herself and her children, should she die childless, the amount to be divided between her sister Adeline M. Henry and the surviving daughters of my brother C. M. Bayard.\u201d By the fifth paragraph testatrix gave $100 a year to each of the daughters of her brother, C. M. Bayard, and by the sixth paragraph she gave $100 a year also to her niece, Adeline McKean Henry, and her nephew, Alexander Henry, Jr. By the sixth paragraph also she gave her residuary estate in trust, to be paid to her sister, Caroline Bayard Henry (named in the will as C. R. Henry) for life, and upon the sister\u2019s death to pay the principal to the sister\u2019s children. The testatrix appointed as trustees her nephew, James Wilson Bayard, and her brother-in-law, Alexander Henry, Sr.\nThe testatrix was survived by four daughters of her brother, C. M. Bayard, viz.: Adele J. Bayard, Meta W. Bayard, Elise G. Bayard and Edith S. B. Wright, and by her sister, Caroline B. Henry, and the latter\u2019s two children, Adeline McK. Henry (afterwards Mrs. Baggs) and. Alexander Henry, Jr. The niece, Mary Bayard Henry, predeceased the testatrix, dying January 6,1890. Mrs. Baggs (nee Adeline M. Henry) died on October 27, 1914, leaving a will in Avhich A. M. Baggs and the Beal Estate Trust Company were named executors and trustees. A guardian ad litem Avas appointed for her two minor children, Henry McKean Baggs and Edward Wolcott Baggs, to represent them at the audit of 1928. Decedent\u2019s sister, Caroline Bayard Henry, died on February 23, 1939. The four daughters of C. M. Bayard and Alexander Henry, Jr., still survive.\nThe first, second and third accounts of the executors of the Estate of Anna M. Bayard were confirmed by adjudication dated March 6,1891, May 12,1892, and May 11, 1908, respectively. James Wilson Bayard, the surviving trustee (Alexander Henry, Sr., the other trustee, having predeceased him) died on December 30,1927. By decree dated January 20, 1928, the Pennsylvania Company was appointed substituted trustee. The account of James Wilson Bayard as stated by his executors, was confirmed by Judge Steakne by adjudication dated February 17, 1928.\nThe original trustees interpreted the fourth paragraph of the will as giving $100 per annum to Adeline McKean Henry Baggs and $100 to each of the four daughters of C. M. Bayard and made payments upon this basis until the death of Mrs. Baggs on October 27, 1914. Thereafter the trustees, and later the substituted trustee, divided the entire $500 among the four Bayard daughters.\nThe first account of the substituted trustee was audited May 8, 1939, before Judge Klein. At that time it was contended on behalf of Alexander Henry, Jr., one of the remaindermen, that under the proper interpretation of the will\u2019s fourth paragraph (supra) the four daughters of C. M. Bayard Avere entitled to $250 per annum to be divided among them instead of $500, and that the amount of principal to be retained in trust to support- this payment should be computed upon the basis of $250 and not $500 per annum. This was the first time the court was asked to pass upon the construction of paragraph four. Judge Klein rejected Mr. Henry\u2019s contention, holding, without passing on the merits of the construction question, that the amount of the yearly payments to the Bayards under paragraph four of the will was res adjudicata by virtue of Judge Steaene\u2019s adjudication dated February 17, 1928. A supplemental adjudication by Judge Klein, dated July 19,1939, dealt with another question not raised in this appeal.\nThe court in banc dismissed exceptions to the account filed by Alexander Henry, Jr., and by A. N. Baggs and the Real Estate Trust Company, executors of the will of Adeline McKean Henry Baggs, in an opinion by Judge Bolgee dated November 10, 1939. A Schedule of Distribution was filed and approved on March 21, 1940. As this showed a balance for distribution of $37,171.07, the entire balance was awarded back to the accountant for the annuity fund ($40,000 being required for this purpose under the adjudication) and nothing was awarded the remaindermen. Thereafter, the present appeal was taken upon behalf of Alexander Henry, Jr. An appeal was also taken by A. N. Baggs and the Real Estate Trust Company, executors of the Estate of Adeline McKean Henry Baggs.\nAppellants\u2019 contention is that since testatrix\u2019s niece, Mary Bayard Henry, predeceased her, the alternative gift in that paragraph became effective and the income payment of $500 per annum became divisible as follows: $250 to Mary\u2019s sister, Adeline, and $250 to the four daughters of C. M. Bayard.\nJudge Klein in his adjudication of July 11, 1939, said: \u201cThe fund presently accounted for was awarded to the present accountant as substituted trustee by the adjudication of Steaene, J., of February 17, 1928, and the occasion of the filing of the present account is stated to be the decease on February 23,1939, of Caroline Bayard Henry (who appears from the petition for distribution and the prior adjudication of Stearne, J., to be the same person as C. R. Henry referred to in the will), cestui que trust for life, and the resulting termination of the trust as to her. . . . Each of said daughters [of C. M. Bayard] is entitled, under the terms of the will, to an annuity of $100 and also, under the terms of the adjudication of Stearne, J., referred to above, to one-fourth of the annuity of $500 bequeathed to Mary Bayard Henry, as succeeding annuitants. . . . The Auditing Judge is obliged to rule that the annuity interests of the said four daughters of C. M. Bayard were fixed and determined by the adjudication of Stearne, J., referred to above and are now res judicata and cannot be disturbed. Judge Stearne in his adjudication said as follows: \u2018From the above recitals it appears that Adele J. Bayard, Meta W. Bayard, Elise Gr. Bayard, and Edith S. B. Wright are each entitled to $225 per annum, and Alexander Henry, Jr., is entitled to $100 per annum, and Caroline B. Henry is entitled to the balance of the income.\u2019 All parties in interest are stated to have had notice of the audit before Judge Stearne, and as no exceptions were taken to his conclusions with respect to the interests of the four daughters of C. M. Bayard, it is impossible for the present Auditing Judge to alter the scheme of distribution which has prevailed in this case for almost twenty-five years or since the death of Adeline M. Henry Baggs, and which has had judicial sanction for over ten years. Forsythe\u2019s Est., 81 Pa. Superior Ct. 347 (1923); Gould\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 535 [113 A. 552] (1921). The accountants will therefore be directed to retain principal in a sum sufficient to continue paying an annuity of $500 a year to the said four daughters of C. M. Bayard in equal shares.\u201d\nAppellant contends that the 1908 and 1928 adjudications did not make \u201cres judicata\u201d of the question now before us. In the adjudication of 1908 the only reference to the interests bequeathed by the will was a summary of the provisions of that instrument. In summarizing the fourth paragraph Judge Ashman only recited the gift to Mary Bayard Henry and not the alternative gift which actually took effect. Judge Ashman was not requested to construe the fourth paragraph and did not do so.\nThe next account was filed upon the death of the surviving trustee, James Wilson Bayard. It was filed by his executors. This account contained an income accounting only subsequent to January 3, 1927 (the prior period being covered by a waiver). The parties in interest signed an approval of the account and a waiver of an income accounting prior to January 3, 1927. The petition for distribution filed in connection with this account shows that the court was not asked to construe paragraph four, but that under heading (d) which calls for a statement of any questions requiring adjudication, the accountants stated \u201cNone.\u201d\nAppellant says in his paper book: \u201cCaroline Bayard Henry was alive at the time of this audit and she, as life tenant of the residuary trust, would alone benefit by the correct interpretation of the paragraph. . . . The only difference between this adjudication and the one in 1908 is that Judge Steakne recites that the four Bayards are each entitled to $225 per annum ($100 under paragraph five as to which there is no question, and $125 under paragraph four). However, since this was the nature of their interests as stated in the petition for distribution and since the petition for distribution stated there was no question requiring adjudication, we do not believe it can be said that the Auditing Judge adjudicated the meaning of the fourth paragraph of the Will to such an extent as to prejudice the rights of the appellant at a future accounting.\u201d Appellant adds: \u201cUntil the present audit appellant had no standing to raise the question of the paragraph\u2019s construction, that no question was called to the court\u2019s attention and that the court never consciously adjudicated the meaning of this paragraph.\u201d We agree with the foregoing contention of appellant.\nAppellees contend that the proper construction of this Avill requires a distribution per capita despite the use of the word \u201cbetween\u201d in paragraph four.\nIt must be conceded that the preposition \u201cbetween\u201d applies in its literal sense to only two objects while \u201camong\u201d always applies to more than two objects. Webster\u2019s International Dictionary says of this preposition \u201cbetween\u201d: \u201cWhen [it is] used of more than two objects, it brings them severally and individually into the relation expressed; as a treaty between three poAVers; the three survivors had but one pair of shoes between them.\u201d This correct usage of \u201cbetween\u201d even when there are more than two objects who are to be brought \u201cseverally and individually into the relation expressed,\u201d has perhaps given rise to the widespread use of this preposition \u201cbetween\u201d when more than two objects are to be affected. It is certain that in ordinary speech this preposition is frequently used when strictly correct speech calls for the use of the preposition \u201camong.\u201d In Ghriskey\u2019s Est., 248 Pa. 90, 93 A. 824, this court, speaking through Justice Stewart, said of the preposition \u201cbetween\u201d that \u201csometimes, more or less frequently, it is used interchangeably with the word \u2018among\u2019 which as properly used, refers to a greater number than two.\u201d In that case where a testatrix bequeathed her residuary estate \u201cto be divided equally between my husband and our children, the children\u2019s money to be held in trust until they are 21 years respectively,\u201d and was survived by her husband and three children this court construed the will as dividing the gift equally between two classes, one of which consisted of the husband, and the other, of the children. In that case both the court below and this court held that the will itself contained a suggestion of division by class, i.e., that it was reasonable to believe that the testatrix would be inclined to give one-lialf of the remainder of her estate to her husband and the other half to her children, and that therefore the preposition \u201cbetween\u201d should be given its \u201cprecise literal meaning.\u201d In other cases also this court has interpreted the preposition \u201cbetween\u201d as relating to only two legatees or classes of legatees, when there were two distinct classes as related to the testator. We have also judicially recognized that the use of the preposition \u201cbetween\u201d does not inflexibly apply to two classes of recipients and thus require a distribution per stirpes.\nIn Hick\u2019s Est., 134 Pa. 507, 19 A. 705, this court held that under a will which provided that the testator\u2019s property should be \u201cequally divided between\u201d his wife Martha and his daughters, Ida B. and Ella B., such legatee would take one-third, the word \u201cbetween\u201d being used as synonymous with the word \u201camong.\u201d In that case we affirmed Per Curiam the opinion of President Judge Hanna of the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County, who, before citing several cases in which the use of the preposition \u201cbetween\u201d was interpreted as sanctioning a per capita distribution among more than two legatees, said in his opinion: \u201cIt is now contended by the widow that her late husband intended his estate to be divided into two equal shares, she being entitled to one share, and that remaining to. be equally divided between his two daughters; and that such was his intention is shown by the use of the preposition \u2018between,\u2019 which can only be properly construed by giving it its correct and accurate signification; and, as it applies properly only to the case of two parties, two objects, two points, or two classes, we must conclude that testator\u2019s meaning was thus to divide his estate between his wife and daughters, the former taking one share and the latter another share. But we do not think such was his intention. If testator had used the common preposition \u2018among\u2019 or \u2018amongst,\u2019 it is conceded there would be no room for argument. And it needs no illustration to show the frequent and familiar use of the word \u2018between,\u2019 even by well-educated and otherwise accurate linguists, when \u2018among\u2019 is intended.\u201d\nIn McIntire v. McIntire, 192 U. S. 116, the United States Supreme Court held that where a testator left a residue \u201cto be equally divided between my brothers Edwin and Charles\u2019 children,\u201d and where at the date of the will Edwin had died leaving six children, five of whom survived the testator, and Charles had two children, one of whom survived the testator, the residue was to be divided per capita. In that case Justice Holmes, speaking for the court, said: \u201c \u2018Between,\u2019 if accurately used, imports that not more than two persons or groups are set against each other. . . . The equality of division is an equality between the groups. . . . But the court is of opinion that the general rule of construction must prevail according to which, in the case of a gift to the children of several persons described as standing in a certain relation to the testator, the objects of the gift take per capita and not per stirpes.\u201d\nIn the fifth paragraph of the will the testatrix used the pronoun \u201ceither\u201d as referring to one of four nieces whereas \u201ceither\u201d can be used correctly as referring to only one of two persons. It is not unlikely that a person who would be so unprecise in the use of words as thus to use \u201ceither\u201d would also use the preposition \u201cbetween\u201d as synonymous with \u201camong.\u201d\nThe five recipients of the testatrix\u2019s bounty were five nieces, one niece being the daughter of testatrix\u2019s sister and four being the daughters of her brother. In the absence of any text or fact persuasive to the contrary, it is reasonable to infer that the testatrix wished these nieces to share equally in the annuity she created in the paragraph under review.\nThe decree is affirmed; the costs to be paid by the estate."}
