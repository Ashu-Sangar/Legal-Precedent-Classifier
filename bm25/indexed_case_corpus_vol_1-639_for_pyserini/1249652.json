{"id": "1249652", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Allen M. Stearns,\nThe appeal raises the question whether the words in the second item of the will dispose of a residue of a residue or indicate testator\u2019s intent to bequeath the residue in its entirety. The correct proportions of the amount of the lapsed legacy distributable to the other residuary legatees is also in issue.\nHoward Morton Slater, the testator, died June 15, 1951. His beneficiaries were three first cousins: Mary Spratt Aber, a daughter of a sister of testator\u2019s mother, and Ralph Canon and Alice Canon, children of a sister of testator\u2019s father. The will provided for funeral arrangements and for the erection of a headstone. By the second item of the will testator bequeathed his entire estate to the three first cousins as follows: \u201cI give, devise and bequeath TWO-THIRDS (2/3) of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of whatsoever nature and wheresoever situate, to my cousin, MRS. L. E. ABER of No. 19 Mackin Avenue, Ingram, Pennsylvania, her heirs and assigns forever, and the remaining ONE-THIRD (1/3) of my estate, real, personal and mixed, of whatsoever nature and wheresoever situate, I give, devise and bequeath, in equal shares, to my cousins, RALPH and ALICE CANON, of jancey Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, their heirs and assigns forever.\u201d\nAlice Canon, the beneficiary of such one-sixth of testator\u2019s estate, predeceased testator on January 5, 1947. Her legacy, in consequence, lapsed. Mary Spratt Aber and Ralph Canon survived testator.\nAt the audit of the account of the executor, Ralph Canon claimed that he was entitled to the entire lapsed one-sixth share. Mary Spratt Aber contended that, being the beneficiary of two-thirds of testator\u2019s residuary estate, she was entitled to four-fifths of the one-sixth lapsed legacy. The auditing judge ruled, contrary to both contentions, that no residuary estate existed. He decreed that Alice Canon\u2019s lapsed one-sixth share passed under the intestate law. Both legatees filed exceptions. Upon argument the court in banc sustained the exceptions of Ralph Canon. It was decreed that the portion of Item II reading: \u201c. . . and the remaining ONE-THIRD (1/3) . . . I give, devise and bequeath, in equal shares, to [named cousins] . . .\u201d constituted the residuary clause and that . .[t]he entire one-third of the above estate should, therefore, be distributed to Ralph Canon.\u201d\nWe are all of opinion that not only is such interpretation incorrect, but that the proportional distribution of the residue is likewise erroneous.\nThis Court in Armstrong Estate, 347 Pa. 23, 31 A. 2d 528, adopting and quoting from the opinion of the late judge Gest in Adam\u2019s Estate, 11 D. & C. 644, decided that the residue of an estate is all that is left after devises and legacies have been paid or satisfied. At p. 25 it is stated: \u201c. . . where a testator manifests an intent to dispose of everything not otherwise disposed of by the will, the dispositive clause is regarded as residuary; . . See also Bricker\u2019s Estate, 335 Pa. 300, 6 A. 2d 905; Suttner Estate, 348 Pa. 159, 34 A. 2d 483; Yeisley Estate, 358 Pa. 200, 56 A. 2d 205.\nThe second item of the will being clearly residuary, the question is posed whether or not testator, in disposing of two-thirds of the residue, intended the remaining one-third as his ultimate residuary disposition. In other words, did he intend such latter provision as a \u201cresidue of a residue\u201d. The learned court below so regarded it. With this construction we do not agree. A testator1, in disposing of his residuary estate, may carve therefrom portions of the residue and devise and bequeath such portions to designated persons or uses, and then pass that which remains to others. This is a typical situation of a \u201cresidue of a residue\u201d. The facts in Carson\u2019s Estate, 130 Pa. Superior Ct. 133, 196 A. 527, illustrate such a situation. But, in the present case testator was manifestly disposing of his entire residuary estate. For reasons now resting with testator he favored one cousin over his two other cousins which was his privilege. In disposing of his entire residue there is no reason why he could not do so in the designated fractional shares. In Carson\u2019s Estate, supra, had the specific gift exhausted the residuary estate, nothing would remain for distributees of the \u201cresidue of the residue\u201d. In the instant case the named fractions necessarily relate to the entire residue.\nWe then come to the question of distribution of the one-sixth lapsed share of the residuary estate. It was the early rule that \u201cevery legacy implies a condition that the legatee shall survive the testator, and that where the legatee dies in the lifetime of the testator the legacy lapses\u201d: Sergeant, J. in Comfort v. Mather, 2 W. & S. 450, 453; Berger Estate, 360 Pa. 366, 371, 61 A. 2d 855; McFerren Estate, 365 Pa. 490, 76 A. 2d 759. The Legislature .from time to time..enacted various statutes, unnecessary here to recite, saving l\u00e9gacies to.-. children, .other, lineal..., descendants, brothers and sisters and their issue. At common law a lapsed devise descended to the heir while a lapsed bequest fell into the residue: Massey\u2019s Appeal, 88 Pa. 470. In the various wills acts culminating in the Wills Act of April 24, 1947, P. L. 89, Section 14 (9), 20 PS 180.14 (9), it is provided that lapsed or void devises and bequests shall be included in the residue. Under Section 14 (10) of the Wills Act of 1947, supra, disposition of lapsed or void devises or bequests is made. This Section of the Act reads: \u201c. . . When a devise or bequest . . . shall be included in a residuary clause of the will . . ., it shall pass to the other residuary devisees or legatees, if any there be, in proportion to their respective shares or interests in the residue.\u201d (Italics supplied)\nThe amount of the lapsed legacy of one-sixth of the residuary estate must therefore be distributed to the other residuary legatees \u201cin proportion to their respective shares or interest in the residue\u201d.\nThe lapsed share of Alice Canon, being one-half of one-third, amounted to one-sixth of the residue. Mary Spratt Aber\u2019s original share was two-thirds of the residue or four-sixths thereof. Ralph Canon\u2019s original share, being similar to that of his deceased sister, was one-sixth. It follows that the proportion of interest between Mary and Ralph was four-fifths to one-fifth. As Alice\u2019s one-sixth share is to be proportionately divided between Mary and Ralph the correct proportional division between the remaining residuary legatee is therefore:\nAlary Spratt Aber\nOriginal 2/3 share 10/15\n4/5 of lapsed 1/6 share 2/15\n12/15 equals 4/5\nRalph Canon\nOriginal 1/6 share 5/30\n1/5 of lapsed 1/6 share 1/30\n6/30 equals 1/5\nMary Spratt Aber should therefore receive four-fifths and Ealph Canon one-fifth of the residue.\nThe appeal is sustained, the decree reversed and a definitive decree of distribution is directed to be made in accordance with this opinion. Costs to be paid out of the corpus of the estate."}
