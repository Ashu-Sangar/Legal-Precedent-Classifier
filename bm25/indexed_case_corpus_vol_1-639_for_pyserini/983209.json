{"id": "983209", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe subjects of complaint in this case are the refusals of the court to sustain the several exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report, recited in the six specifications of error respectively.\nAn examination of the record discloses nothing that requires either a reversal or modification of the decree. We quite agree with the learned president of the orphans\u2019 court in saying: \u201cWe have failed to- find anything to convince us that the learned auditor has erred with reference to the matters complained of by the exceptant, either as to the distribution, or disposition of the costs.\u201d\nThe facts are clearly stated by the auditor, and the questions arising thereon are so satisfactorily disposed of by him, that we affirm the decree on his report.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at appellant\u2019s costs."}
