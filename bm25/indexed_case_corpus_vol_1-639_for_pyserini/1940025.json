{"id": "1940025", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nWilliam A. Hinson, III, here appeals from the judgment of sentence imposed in the trial court following his conviction by a jury of murder in the second degree. We affirm.\nAppellant first complains that the \u201csheer length and technicality of the charge [to the jury] made it confusing.\u201d The record discloses that the complaint now made of the charge was not asserted in the trial court, and, as we have repeatedly ruled, issues not raised below will not be considered on appeal. Of. Commonwealth v. Myers, 439 Pa. 381, 266 A. 2d 756 (1970).\nThe only other assignment of error maintains the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to establish beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of malice, a necessary element of murder in the second degree. We disagree.\nProm the Commonwealth\u2019s trial evidence, the jury was warranted in finding the following facts.\nHinson abused a lady patron in a beauty shop operated by his cousin, William Burke; an argument ensued between the two men during which Burke remarked that if appellant was not his cousin he would cut his throat; Samuel Mosley who was present as an onlooker uttered a disparging remark as to Hinson\u2019s conduct; the latter then left the establishment stating, \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d; about twenty minutes later after Burke locked up the beauty shop and he and Mosley repaired to the kitchen of the Burke residence on the second floor of the building, Hinson appeared and entered the kitchen with a shotgun and fired it twice without provocation in the direction of Mosley from a distance of about five feet away. Mosley died instantly from a shotgun wound of the groin.\nHinson testified at trial and denied he intentionally fired the gun at Mosley. He also said that at the time involved he was \u201chigh\u201d and lacked a \u201csense of what he was doing\u201d as the result of imbibing liquor and Liking a quantity of pills. When asked why he returned to the Burke residence after the incident in the beauty parlor, he answered, \u201cI just wanted to know was my life in danger or was I going to get hurt.\u201d Questioned why he carried the shotgun, he answered, \u201cTo protect myself.\u201d\nUnder the evidence, whether or not the shotgun was deliberately or accidentally discharged in Mosley\u2019s direction was strictly a jury question. Accepting the fact that Hinson was intoxicated at the time of the shooting, this, in itself, would not exonerate him from guilt, nor would it reduce the degree of culpability from murder to manslaughter. Commonwealth v. Walters, 431 Pa. 74, 244 A. 2d 757 (1968).\nJudgment affirmed.\nMr. Chief Justice Bell and Mr. Justice Barbieri took no part in the consideration or decision of this ease."}
