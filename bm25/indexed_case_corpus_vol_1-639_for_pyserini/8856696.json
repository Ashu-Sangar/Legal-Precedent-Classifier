{"id": "8856696", "contents": "The opinion of the court wras delivered October 6th, 1884.\nPer Curiam.\nWe think it very clear that the plaintiff in error is engaged in carrying on such a business within this Commonwealth, as to subject it to the statutes imposing taxation. While a tax on the capital stock of a company is a tax on its property and assets, yet the capital stock of a company, and its property and assets are not identical. The coaches of the company are its property. They are operated within this state. They are daily passing from one end of the state to the other. They are used in performing the functions for .which the corporation was created. The fact that they also are operated in other states cannot wholly exempt them from taxation here. It reduces the value of the property in this state justly subject to taxation here. This was recognized in the court below and we think the proportion was fixed according to a just and equitable rule.\nJudgment affirmed."}
