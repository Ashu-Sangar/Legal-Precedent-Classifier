{"id": "554331", "contents": "Per Curiam:\nWe think the clause of the will in question makes a valid disposition of \u201cthe rest, residue and remainder\u201d of the estate of the testator. It gives to the executor \u201cfull and unlimited power and authority to appropriate or dispose \u201d of it \u201c to such objects, persons or institutions as in his discretion shall be best and proper,\u201d as testator has \u201c full confidence in his judgment, ability and integrity.\u201d Thus it is shown that the executor has unlimited power to \u201cappropriate \u201d it according to his discretion. As, then, his authority is not restricted to a power of disposal, but at his option he may appropriate the same or the proceeds arising from a sale thereof to such persons as he thinks proper, \u25a0the learned judge arrived at a correct conclusion.\nDecree affirmed, and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
