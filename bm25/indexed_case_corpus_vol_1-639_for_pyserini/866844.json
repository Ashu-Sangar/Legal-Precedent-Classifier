{"id": "866844", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nAn examination of this record has satisfied us that the learned judge\u2019s findings of fact, rulings on questions of evidence and conclusions of law, complained of in the assignments of error, are substantially correct. There is nothing in either of the specifications that requires a reversal or modification of the decree, and they are therefore dismissed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant."}
