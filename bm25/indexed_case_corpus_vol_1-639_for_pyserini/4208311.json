{"id": "4208311", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice TODD.\nThis Court granted allowance of appeal in the instant case to determine the proper test for evaluating whether an oil or gas lease has produced \u201cin paying quantities,\u201d as first discussed by this Court in Young v. Forest Oil Co., 194 Pa. 243, 45 A. 121 (1899). After careful consideration, we hold that, where, as here, production on a well has been marginal or sporadic, such that for some period profits did not exceed operating costs, the phrase \u201cin paying quantities\u201d must be construed with reference to an operator\u2019s good faith judgment. Furthermore, as we find the lower courts considered the operator\u2019s good faith judgment in concluding the oil and gas lease at issue in the instant case has produced in paying quantities, we affirm the order of the Superior Court affirming the judgment entered by the trial court in favor of T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Co. and PC Exploration, Inc. (collectively, \u201cAppellees\u201d).\nAppellant, Ann Jedlicka, is the owner of a parcel of land consisting of approximately 70 acres located in North Mahoning Township (the \u201cJedlicka tract\u201d). Title to the Jedlicka tract was conveyed from James and Anna Jedlicka, husband and wife, to Anna Jedlicka and Ann Jedlicka, mother and daughter, in October 1979. The Jedlicka tract is part of a larger tract of land consisting of approximately 163 acres, which was conveyed to Samuel Findley and David Findley by deed dated February 24, 1925 (the \u201cFindley property\u201d). In 1928, Samuel Findley and David Findley conveyed to T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Co. (\u201cT.W. Phillips\u201d) an oil and gas lease covering all 163 acres of the Findley property (the \u201cFindley lease\u201d), which included the Jedlicka tract. The Findley lease, characterized as a pressure lease, established royalty payments to the lessor based upon the pressure of the well. The lease also contains a habendum clause, which provides:\nTo have and to hold the above-described premises for the sole and only purpose of drilling and operating for oil and gas with the exclusive right to operate for same for the term of two years, and as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities, or operations for oil or gas are being conducted thereon, including the right to drill other wells.\nLease, July 2,1928, at 1 (R.R. at 13a-14a). Notably, the term \u201cin paying quantities\u201d is not defined in the lease. Subsequently, the Findley property was subdivided and sold \u2014 including the Jedlicka tract \u2014 subject to the Findley lease.\nIn 1929, pursuant to the Findley lease, T.W. Phillips drilled four gas wells, identified as Well Nos. 1 through 4. Well No. 4 is situated on what is now the Jedlicka tract. Well No. 2 was temporarily abandoned in 1955, and Well No. 4 was temporarily abandoned in 1953. All four wells were fractured in 1967 and eventually assigned to PC Exploration, Inc. (\u201cPC Exploration\u201d) on June 15, 2004. Thereafter, PC Exploration drilled four additional wells, identified as Well Nos. 6 through 9. Jedlicka has received royalties and free gas throughout the life of the lease.\nSubsequently, PC Exploration made plans to drill four more wells \u2014 Well Nos. 10 through 13 \u2014 on the Jedlicka tract. Jedlicka objected to the construction of these new wells, claiming that T.W. Phillips failed to maintain production \u201cin paying quantities\u201d under the habendum clause of the Findley lease, and, as a result, that the lease lapsed and terminated. Specifically, Jedlicka argued that there has not been continuous production in paying quantities on the wells because, in 1959, T.W. Phillips suffered a loss of approximately $40 as a result of operations under the Findley lease.\nIn 2005, Appellees filed a declaratory judgment action against Jedlicka to determine their rights with regard to the Jedlicka tract under the Findley lease. Appellees maintained that the Findley lease remains valid; that the wells on the original Findley property have produced gas in paying quantities because they have continued to pay a profit over operating expenses; and that they have operated the wells in good faith to make a profit. Prior to trial, Jedlicka filed a motion in limine to exclude evidence of Appellees\u2019 post-1974 operating expenses and revenues for Well Nos. 1 through 4 because Appellees did not have any depletion schedules for those wells after 1974. The trial court denied the motion and allowed Appellees to introduce other evidence of expenses, revenue, and production.\nAppellees then filed a motion in limine, opining that Jedlicka\u2019s claims were barred by operation of Rule 1901 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Judicial Administration. Appellees noted that, in 1988, Jedlicka commenced an action by writ of summons challenging the validity of the Findley lease, but that action was dismissed with prejudice as an inactive case pursuant to Pa.R.J.A. 1901. Appellees further noted that Jedlicka failed to allege any reasons for such inactivity in a timely petition for permission to reinstate the cause of action. Accordingly, Appellees argued that Jedlicka should be precluded from presenting any evidence or testimony regarding the production or operation of the wells on the Findley property prior to 1988. The trial court heard testimony on Appellees\u2019 motion and determined that the lease at issue in the 1988 action was the same as the lease at issue in the case sub judice; however, the trial court was unable to conclude that the issues in the two actions were identical, or that Jedlicka was attempting to argue the same claims, and thus denied Appellees\u2019 motion.\nOn April 16, 2007, a bench trial was held before President Judge William J. Martin of the Indiana County Court of Common Pleas. Following trial, President Judge Martin determined that, notwithstanding the $40 loss suffered in 1959, Appellees had produced gas on their leasehold in paying quantities, and, therefore, that the Findley lease remained in effect. In determining that Appellees produced gas in paying quantities, the trial court relied on this Court\u2019s 1899 decision in Young v. Forest Oil, wherein we held that consideration should be given to a lessee\u2019s good faith judgment when determining whether oil was produced in paying quantities. The trial court noted that Appellees \u201ccontinued efforts in production after 1959 and [the owners of the Jedlicka tract] continued to receive royalty payments per the lease for more than thirty years without asserting that the lease had expired.\u201d T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Co. and PC Exploration, Inc. v. Jedlicka, No. 10362 CD 2005, at 5.\nAdditionally, the trial court rejected Jedlicka\u2019s suggestion that, instead of the Young test, the court should apply a test utilized by federal and some state courts, under which courts \u201cinterpretf] gas leases in a more objective manner using a computation of production receipts minus royalty minus expenses including marketing, labor, trucking, repair, taxes, fees and other expenses.\u201d T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Co. and PC Exploration, Inc., No. 10362 CD 2005, at 5-6. Recognizing that the objective approach favored by Jedlicka incorporates the concern that \u201clessees should not be allowed to hold land indefinitely for purely speculative purposes,\u201d the trial court noted that Pennsylvania has not adopted this objective approach, and nevertheless concluded that \u201cbased upon all of the testimony and other evidence presented, the rationale utilized in support of a completely objective test is not applicable herein.\u201d Id. at 6. The trial court explained, in particular, that the Findley lease \u201cis a pressure lease, not a 1/8 royalty lease,\u201d and \u201c[t]he evidence indicates that the lessees were operating the wells in good faith and there was no evidence that they were holding the land for purely speculative purposes.\u201d Id.\nOn November 26, 2008, the Superior Court affirmed the decision of the trial court in an unpublished memorandum opinion, which, upon joint motion of the parties, was subsequently published. T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Co. and PC Exploration, Inc. v. Jedlicka, 964 A.2d 13 (Pa.Super.2008). The Superior Court first concluded that our decision in Young, although more than a century old, remains good law. The Superior Court further found that, under Young, \u201cthe good faith of the lessee is a necessary determination,\u201d and held that Jedlicka failed to carry her burden of establishing that Appellees acted in bad faith. T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Co. and PC Exploration, Inc., 964 A.2d at 19. Jedlicka petitioned for allowance of appeal, and, on July 29, 2009, this Court granted her petition to consider the following issue: \u201cDid the Superior Court misapply the decision of this Court in Young v. Forest Oil Co., 194 Pa. 243, 45 A. 121 (Pa.1899), by holding that Pennsylvania employs a purely subjective test to determine whether an oil or gas lease has produced \u2018in paying quantities.\u2019 \u201d T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Co. v. Jedlicka, 602 Pa. 154, 978 A.2d 347 (2009) (order).\nWhen reviewing the findings of a court in equity, an appellate court\u2019s review \u201cis limited to a determination of whether the chancellor committed an error of law or abused his discretion. A final decree in equity will not be disturbed unless it is unsupported by the evidence or demonstrably capricious.\u201d Kepple v. Fairman Drilling Co., 532 Pa. 304, 312, 615 A.2d 1298, 1302 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). Although facts found by the chancellor, when supported by competent evidence in the record, are binding, no such deference is required for conclusions of law, which we review de novo. Id.\nFurthermore, a lease is in the nature of a contract and is controlled by principles of contract law. J.K. Willison v. Consol. Coal Co., 536 Pa. 49, 54, 637 A.2d 979, 982 (1994). It must be construed in accordance with the terms of the agreement as manifestly expressed, and \u201c[t]he accepted and plain meaning of the language used, rather than the silent intentions of the contracting parties, determines the construction to be given the agreement.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). Further, a party seeking to terminate a lease bears the burden of proof. See Jefferson County Gas Co. v. United Natural Gas Co., 247 Pa. 283, 286, 93 A. 340, 341 (1915).\nIn order to better assess the parties\u2019 arguments in the case sub judice, we consider briefly the unique characteristics of an oil and gas lease. As this Court recognized in Brown v. Haight, \u201c[t]he traditional oil and gas \u2018lease\u2019 is far from the simplest of property concepts. In the case law oil and gas \u2018leases\u2019 have been described as anything from licenses to grants in fee.\u201d 435 Pa. 12, 15, 255 A.2d 508, 510 (1969). Generally, however, the title conveyed in an oil and gas lease is inchoate, and is initially for the purpose of exploration and development. Calhoon v. Neely, 201 Pa. 97, 101, 50 A. 967, 968 (1902); Burgan v. South Penn Oil Co., 243 Pa. 128, 137, 89 A. 823, 826 (1914) (\u201cThe title is inchoate, and for purposes of exploration only until oil is found.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Hite v. Falcon Partners, 13 A.3d 942 (Pa.Super.2011) (same); Jacobs v. CNG Transmission Corp., 332 F.Supp.2d 759, 772 (W.D.Pa.2004) (same).\nIf development during the agreed upon primary term is unsuccessful, no estate vests in the lessee. If, however, oil or gas is produced, a fee simple determinable is created in the lessee, and the lessee\u2019s right to extract the oil or gas becomes vested. Calhoon, 201 Pa. at 101, 50 A. at 968; Jacobs, 332 F.Supp.2d at 772-73. A fee simple determinable is an estate in fee that automatically reverts to the grantor upon the occurrence of a specific event. Brown, 435 Pa. at 18, 255 A.2d at 511. The interest held by the grantor after such a conveyance is termed \u201ca possibility of reverter.\u201d Higbee Corp. v. Kennedy, 286 Pa.Super. 101, 428 A.2d 592, 595 (1981). Such a fee is a fee simple, because it may last forever in the grantee and his heirs and assigns, \u201cthe duration depending upon the concurrence of collateral circumstances which qualify and debase the purity of the grant.\u201d Id. at 595 n. 4 (quoting Slegel v. Lauer, 148 Pa. 236, 241, 23 A. 996, 997 (1892)).\nWithin the oil and gas industry, oil and gas leases generally contain several key provisions, including the granting clause, which initially conveys to the lessee the right to drill for and produce oil or gas from the property; the habendum clause, which is used to fix the ultimate duration of the lease; the royalty clause; and the terms of surrender. Jacobs, 332 F.Supp.2d at 764 (citing 3 Howard R. Williams & Charles J. Meyers, Oil and Gas Law \u00a7 601 (2003)). Further,\nA habendum clause is used to fix the ultimate duration of an oil and gas lease. 2 Summers, THE LAW OF OIL AND GAS \u00a7 281. \u201cThe habendum clause of the modern oil and gas lease is the result of a long process of development, in which many influences have aided in shaping its final form,\u201d chief of which have been the [distinct] interests of the lessor and lessee, the peculiar needs of the industry and the interpretation and enforcement of certain phrases by the Courts. Id. at \u00a7 282 Experimentation in the industry for a suitable durational term progressed from definite term leases, which placed the lessee at a disadvantage if production was only attained late in the term or extended beyond the term, to a definite term with an option to renew, to long term leases with conditional clauses extending the term through the production life of the land. Id. at \u00a7\u00a7 283-287.\nJacobs, 332 F.Supp.2d at 765 n. 1.\nTypically, as herein, the habendum clause in an oil and gas lease provides that a lease will remain in effect for as long as oil or gas is produced \u201cin paying quantities.\u201d Traditionally, use of the term \u201cin paying quantities\u201d in a habendum clause of an oil or gas lease was regarded as for the benefit of the lessee, as a lessee would not want to be obligated to pay rent for premises which have ceased to be productive, or for which the operating expenses exceed the income. Swiss Oil Corp. v. Riggsby, 252 Ky. 374, 67 S.W.2d 30, 31 (1933). More recently, however, and as demonstrated by the instant case, these clauses are relied on by landowners to terminate a lease.\nAs noted supra, the habendum clause contained in the lease at issue provides that Appellee shall have the right to drill for oil and gas for the term of two years \u201cand as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities, or operations for oil or gas are being conducted thereon.\u201d Lease, July 2, 1928, at 1 (R.R. at 13a-14a). It is the meaning of the term \u201cin paying quantities,\u201d which is not defined in the lease, that is the crux of the dispute between the parties; however, the parties agree that the lease is controlled by our 1899 decision in Young.\nIn Young v. Forest Oil, the plaintiff landowner sought a declaration of forfeiture of an oil lease held by the defendant due to the defendant\u2019s alleged failure to develop the land. The trial court found that the defendant had \u201csufficiently developed\u201d the west end of the plaintiffs farm. However, the court determined that the drilling of a single well on the north and east portions of the plaintiffs farm, which admittedly revealed no oil or gas, did not support the defendant\u2019s refusal to drill additional wells on the remainder of the farm, because \u201c[t]here remains a large portion of plaintiffs farm which ... ought to produce oil in paying quantities, with a reasonable degree of certainty.\u201d Id. at 248-49, 45 A. at 122. As a result, the trial court determined, \u201cunder the circumstances of this case the defendant\u2019s refusal to sink additional wells on plaintiffs farm is a wrongful act, amounting to a fraudulent use of the lease, to plaintiffs injury.\u201d Id. at 249, 45 Pa. at 122.\nOn appeal, this Court reversed, noting that the trial court\u2019s conclusion \u201cproceed[ed] from an erroneous view of the law,\u201d and stating:\nIn the present case the conclusion of the court rests on nothing else than such a difference of judgment. There is not a scintilla of evidence for any other basis. The lessee contracted to put down one paying well. He did in fact put down five, four of which produced oil for a time. Even considering the plaintiffs side alone, the weight of the evidence in favor of the court\u2019s conclusion is exceedingly light. Passing over the plaintiffs extraordinary reasoning, that, because one well put down in the alleged insufficiently tested part of the farm proved to be a dry hole, therefore another hole in the same portion would produce a paying well, we have looked in vain for any testimony that even the experts are willing to stake their judgments on any such result. Not a single witness says so.... Even if [a witness] had said so, with sufficient positiveness to convince the court as a matter of judgment, it would not have been enough.... The operator, who has assumed the obligations of the lease, has put his money and labor into the undertaking, and is now called upon to determine whether it will pay to spend some thousands of dollars more in sinking another well to increase the production of the tract, is entitled to follow his own judgment. If that is exercised in good faith, a different opinion by the lessor, or the experts, or the court, or all combined, is of no consequence, and will not authorize a decree interfering with him.\nId. at 249-50, 45 A. at 122.\nWith regard to the plaintiffs argument to this Court that the lease had expired because oil was no longer produced in paying quantities, we noted that, despite declining to grant the plaintiff relief on this ground, the trial judge found it unnecessary to determine the exact meaning of the phrase \u201cin paying quantities.\u201d However, we nevertheless agreed the trial court was correct not to grant relief on this ground, explaining:\nThe phrase \u2018found or produced in paying quantities\u2019 means paying quantities to the lessee or operator. If oil has not been found and the prospects are not such that the lessee is willing to incur the expense of a well (or a subsequent or second well, as the case may be), the stipulated condition for the termination of the lease has occurred. So, also, if oil has been found, but no longer pays the expenses of production. But if a well, being down, pays a profit, \u2014 even a small one, over the operating expenses, \u2014 it is producing in \u2018paying quantities,\u2019 though it may never repay its cost, and the operation as a whole may result in a loss. New wells, except the very largest, repay cost under a considerable time; many never do; but that is no reason why the first loss should not be reduced by profits, however small, in continuing to operate. The phrase \u2018paying quantities,\u2019 therefore, is to be construed with reference to the operator, and by his judgment when exercised in good faith.\nId. at 250-51, 45 A. at 122-23.\nIn Colgan v. Forest Oil Co., 194 Pa. 234, 45 A. 119 (Pa.1899), which we issued on the same day as our opinion in Young, we elaborated on the concept of good faith judgment. Therein, the owner of land (lessor) filed a bill in equity against the lessee for specific performance of covenants contained in an oil lease, or, alternatively, for forfeiture of the lease. The lessee challenged the number of wells put down by the lessor, as well as the location of the wells. Concerning the lessee\u2019s good faith judgment, we stated:\nSo long as the lessee is acting in good faith on business judgment, he is not bound to take any other party\u2019s, but may stand on his own. Every man who invests his money and labor in a business does it on the confidence he has in being able to conduct it in his own way. No court has any power to impose a different judgment on him, however erroneous it may deem his to be. Its right to interfere does not arise until it has been shown clearly that he is not acting in good faith on his business judgment, but fraudu lently, with intent to obtain a dishonest advantage over the other party to the contract. Nor is the lessee bound, in case of difference of judgment, to surrender his lease, even pro tanto, and allow the lessor to experiment. Lessees who have bound themselves by covenant to develop a tract, and have entered and produced oil, have a vested estate in the land, which cannot be taken away on any mere difference of judgment.\nId. at 242, 45 A. at 121 (emphasis added).\nJedlicka argues that the lower courts in the instant case erroneously interpreted our decision in Young as providing for a \u201cpurely subjective,\u201d rather than objective, test to determine whether a gas or oil lease is producing in paying quantities. Specifically, Jedlicka argues:\n[Wjhile there are some subjective factors to consider in the overall analysis, the test is not purely subjective, as the trial court found in the instant case. Rather, the threshold inquiry is whether, objectively, the lease is making a profit, \u201chowever small\u201d over its operating expenses. The operating expenses referred to here are the day to day costs of operating the well. Some courts have referred to these expenses as \u201clifting expenses.\u201d The Court in Young was clear that if the wells do not pay this minimal cost of production, they will not be deemed to produce in paying quantities.\nThe subjective element is the second layer of analysis which only enters the determination when the wells have already been found to be producing in paying quantities, but that the profits are insufficient to offset the total expenses incurred in the operation as a whole \u2014 particularly those expenses associated with the exploration, drilling and inception of oil or gas extraction. In such case, the Court in Young explained, it is necessary to determine whether the lessee is exercising its good faith judgment as to whether the wells are being operated for revenue. Provided that it is, and the wells are producing in paying quantities, the lease will not lapse.\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 11-12 (citations omitted).\nBased on her interpretation of Young, and, because it was \u201cconclusively established that the wells under the Lease incurred a net loss in 1959 when their combined revenues were insufficient to overcome the expenses of their operation,\u201d id. at 15, Jedlicka contends:\n[i]t was unnecessary, unprecedented and, indeed, improper, for the trial court to then inquire as to the subjective good faith of T.W. Phillips and [PC Exploration] in operating under the Lease. Once there failed to be a profit, however small, the Lease lapsed by operation of law into a tenancy at will, terminable by Ms. Jedlicka at any time.\nAppellant\u2019s Brief at 15 (footnote and citations omitted).\nAppellees, conversely, argue that Jedlicka\u2019s proposed construction of Young is inconsistent with the very language and intent of that decision. Appellees further maintain that, to the extent Young requires consideration of an operator\u2019s good faith when determining whether a lease has produced in paying quantities, Young is \u201creflective\u201d of \u201cnational authority,\u201d in that\n[a] number of the jurisdictions that have embraced what Jedlicka terms an \u201cobjective\u201d standard for \u201cpaying quantities\u201d have explicitly held that the term to be used in assessing the performance of the lease should be one long enough to \u201cprovide the information which a prudent operator would take into account in [deciding] whether to continue or abandon operation.\u201d\nAppellees\u2019 Brief at 16 (citing, inter alia, Fisher v. Grace Petroleum Corp., 830 P.2d 1380, 1386 (Okla.App.1991); Ross Explorations, Inc. v. Freedom Energy, Inc., 340 Ark. 74, 8 S.W.3d 511 (2000); and Texaco, Inc. v. Fox, supra).\nAlternatively, Appellees argue that, even if Young is not consistent with current prevailing authority, the Findley lease must be interpreted in accordance with the prevailing law at the time the parties entered into the Lease \u2014 namely, Young. Appellees\u2019 Brief at 18 (citing, inter alia, DePaul v. Kauffman, 441 Pa. 386, 398, 272 A.2d 500, 506 (1971) (\u201c[T]he laws in force when a contract is entered into become part of the obligation of [the] contract \u2018with the same effect as if expressly incorporated in its terms.\u2019 \u201d)).\nAs a preliminary matter, we recognize that our decision in Young is more than a century old; thus, there is bound to be uncertainty as to how such precedent applies to disputes involving an industry that has changed rapidly over that same time period. As previously noted, while habendum clauses traditionally were used to protect the interests of lessors, see Swiss Oil, 67 S.W.2d at 31, the clauses are now viewed as a protection for lessees. Moreover, Young left room for interpretation; although Young specifies that whether a lease makes a profit is key to determining if it produces in paying quantities, it does not address over what time period such an assessment is to be made. Further, Young broadly focuses on the good faith judgment of the operator, but without specifying precisely when the operator\u2019s judgment comes into play. The present case allows us to address these open issues.\nJedlicka casts Young as prescribing an objective test \u2014 a mathematical calculation of profits \u2014 which, if the elements are not met, indicates the lease is not producing in paying quantities. She further contends that the good faith judgment of the operator is relevant only where a lease is producing in paying quantities \u2014 i.e., making a profit \u2014 but yet may not offset its total operational expenses. There are two inherent flaws in this argument. First, by its terms, Young requires consideration of the operator\u2019s good faith judgment as part of the assessment of whether the lease produces in paying quantities. See Young, 194 Pa. at 250-51, 45 A. at 122-23 (\u201cThe phrase \u2018paying quantities,\u2019 therefore, is to be construed with reference to the operator, and by his judgment when exercised in good faith.\u201d). Second, Jedlicka\u2019s argument overlooks the fact that profits must be measured over some time period, and, as we discuss below, setting a reasonable time period necessarily implicates the operator\u2019s good faith judgment. Thus, in assessing whether a lease is producing in paying quantities, Young places the principal focus on the good faith judgment of the operator.\nInitially, we note that the courts of many of our sister states have concluded that the determination of whether a lease has produced in paying quantities requires consideration of the operator\u2019s good faith judgment. Indeed, some of these courts have relied on Young. In the landmark case of Clifton v. Koontz, the Texas Supreme Court acknowledged the \u201cgenerally accepted\u201d definition of production \u201cin paying quantities\u201d: \u201cIf a well pays a profit, even small, over operating expenses, it produces in paying quantities, though it may never repay its costs, and the enterprise as a whole may prove unprofitable.\u201d 160 Tex. 82, 325 S.W.2d 684, 690-91 (1959) (quoting Garcia v. King, 139 Tex. 578, 164 S.W.2d 509, 511 (1942)). The court, however, continued:\nIn the case of a marginal well, such as we have here, the standard by which paying quantities is determined is whether or not under all the relevant circumstances a reasonably prudent operator would, for the purpose of making a profit and not merely for speculation, continue to operate a well in the manner in which the well in question was operated. In determining paying quantities, in accordance with the above standard, the trial court necessarily must take into consideration all matters which would influence a reasonable and prudent operator. Some of the factors are: The depletion of the reservoir and the price for which the lessee is able to sell his produce, the relative profitableness of other wells in the area, the operating and marketing costs of the lease, his net profit, the lease provisions, a reasonable period of time under the circumstances, and whether or not the lessee is holding the lease merely for speculative purposes.\nClifton, 325 S.W.2d at 691.\nThus, to the extent the \u201cprofit over operating expenses\u201d test comprised the entire test for determining whether a well produced in paying quantities under Garcia, the Clifton court held that such test was but one of several elements a court must consider when determining whether a reasonably prudent operator would continue to operate a lease for the purpose of making a profit and not for speculation. Another relevant factor in determining whether a well has produced in paying quantities under the reasonable and prudent operator standard is whether the lessee is holding the lease for the purpose of making a profit, and not merely for speculative purposes. See Clifton, 325 S.W.2d at 691. This inquiry necessarily implicates the issue of whether a lessee has exercised his judgment in good faith.\nIn Pack v. Santa Fe Minerals, the Oklahoma Supreme Court likewise held that an operator\u2019s good faith is a necessary consideration in determining whether a well has produced in paying quantities. The court, in holding that a failure to market oil or gas did not alone operate to terminate a lease under a \u201ccessation or production\u201d clause, explained:\nMore recently, in Stewart v. Amerada Hess Corp., 604 P.2d 854 (Okla.1979), we reaffirmed the rule that an oil and gas lease could not be terminated under the habendum clause merely because the subject well ceased production in paying quantities. Rather, the finder of fact must also look into the circumstances surrounding the cessation, including the \u201c[djuration and cause of the cessation, as well as the diligence or lack of diligence exercised in the resumption of production.\u201d 604 P.2d at 858, fn. 18. In so holding we affirmed our rejection of a literal construction of the habendum clause stating:\n\u201cUnder a literal or strict interpretation of the \u2018thereafter\u2019 provision in a habendum clause, uninterrupted production \u2014 following expiration of primary term \u2014 would be indispensable to maintain a lease in force. This would mean, of course, that any cessation of production [in the paying-quantities sense of the term], however slight or short, would put an end to the lease. Oklahoma has rejected that literal a view. Our law is firmly settled that the result in each case must depend upon the circumstances that surround cessation. Our view is no doubt influenced in part by the strong policy of our statutory law against forfeiture of estates.\u201d\n869 P.2d 323, 326-27 (Okla.1994) (alterations and emphasis original). The court concluded \u201c[i]n short, the lease continues in existence so long as the interruption of production in paying quantities does not extend for a period longer than reasonable or justifiable in light of the circumstances involved.\u201d Id. at 327 (emphasis original).\nIn Swiss Oil, supra, the Supreme Court of Kentucky acknowledged the term \u201cpaying quantities\u201d:\nis usually defined as being such quantities as will pay a profit, but at least the cost of operating the well. The lessee is not required to market the gas at a loss, but only when there is a reasonable profit, and in determining whether it could be so marketed, the distance to the market, the expense of marketing, and every similar circumstance should be taken into consideration. In determining whether or not a gas or oil well is productive to this extent, the judgment of an experienced operator or lessee, if exercised in good faith, will prevail as against that of a lessor without experience.\n67 S.W.2d at 31 (emphasis added). Thus, although the court in Swiss Oil viewed the phrase \u201cpaying quantities\u201d as a measure to protect a lessee from his obligation to continue operations under an unprofitable lease, it too found the good faith judgment of the lessee to be a relevant consideration in determining whether a well has produced in paying quantities.\nAs the above cases reveal, in determining whether a well that has suffered marginal or sporadic production for some period should be deemed to have failed to produce in paying quantities, \u201ca majority of jurisdictions apply a subjective approach and will look to a number of factors and relevant circumstances to determine whether or not a prudent lessee would continue to operate the lease for profit and not for speculation.\u201d Richard W. Hemingway, Law of Oil and Gas 320 (3rd ed.1991).\nRegarding Jedlicka\u2019s position that, under Young, a determination of whether a well has produced in paying quantities must be based on an objective mathematical calculation of profits, we note that the test for determining in paying quantities could never be purely objective, absent picking an arbitrary time period. Profits must be measured over some time period and establishing what is a reasonable time period warrants consideration of the particular characteristics of a given leasehold. See Clifton, 325 S.W.2d at 691 (one factor to be considered in determining paying quantities is \u201ca reasonable period of time under the circumstances\u201d). An operator, exercising his good faith judgment,- may be willing to wait longer for one lease to become \u201cprofitable\u201d than he is willing to wait for another well to become profitable, and unless it can be established that he is not acting in good faith on his business judgment, but instead is acting with fraudulent or dishonest intent, he does not forfeit his rights under the lease based on a difference in such judgment. Colgan, 194 Pa. at 242, 45 A. at 121.\nThus, with regard to what constitutes a reasonable time period by which to determine whether a well is profitable, we decline to establish a definite rule. Although Jedlicka maintains a one-year period of loss is sufficient to conclude that a well has failed to produce in paying quantities, courts have been disinclined to impose such a rigid term. For example, in Texaco, Inc. v. Fox, supra, in addressing an argument that a 13-year period was sufficient to determine the profitability of a lease, the court explained:\nit is generally accepted that profitability on an oil and gas lease should be determined over a relatively long period of time in order to expose the operation to the leveling influences of time. The arbitrary use of a short period of time while a well is down for a workover is obviously untenable. On the other hand, the use of an unreasonably long period would entail using past glories during flush production to determine a lease\u2019s present condition, which would give a distorted result not reflective of the current status of the lease. The better rule precludes the use of a rigid fixed term for determination of profitability and uses a reasonable time depending upon the circumstances of each case, taking into consideration sufficient time to reflect the current production status of the lease and thus to \u201cprovide the information which a prudent operator would take into account in whether to continue or to abandon the operation.\u201d\n618 P.2d at 848 (citation omitted). Ultimately, the court found the 13-year accounting period unreasonably long, but held such finding was irrelevant in light of its determination on a depreciation issue. See also Ross Explorations, 8 S.W.3d at 516 (noting that appropriate period for determining profitability depends \u201cupon the facts of the particular case and the specific reasons production waned or ended,\u201d and holding that, \u201c[u]nder the facts of the instant case,\u201d a 24-month period was reasonable for determining profitability); Fisher, 830 P.2d at 1386 (\u201c[t]he appropriate time period for determining profitability is a time appropriate under all the facts and circumstances of each case.\u201d). Ultimately, under Young, we conclude that even the determination of what constitutes a \u201creasonable time period\u201d by which to evaluate whether a well has produced in paying quantities must be based on the unique circumstances of each individual case, and be driven by consideration of the good faith judgment of the operator.\nAccordingly, and for the reasons stated above, we hold that, if a well consistently pays a profit, however small, over operating expenses, it will be deemed to have produced in paying quantities. Where, however, production on a well has been marginal or sporadic, such that, over some period, the well\u2019s profits do not exceed its operating expenses, a determination of whether the well has produced in paying quantities requires consideration of the operator\u2019s good faith judgment in maintaining operation of the well. In assessing whether an operator has exercised his judgment in good faith in this regard, a court must consider the reasonableness of the time period during which the operator has continued his operation of the well in an effort to reestablish the well\u2019s profitability.\nAlthough Jedlicka suggests that, \u201cif only a subjective standard is used to determine paying quantities, oil and gas companies may choose to hold onto otherwise unprofitable wells for merely speculative, as opposed to productive, purposes,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 19, we disagree. Under the standard set forth above, a lessor will be protected from such acts because, if the well fails to pay a profit over operating expenses, and the evidence establishes that the lessee was not operating the wells for profit in good faith, the lease will terminate. Consideration of the operator\u2019s good faith judgment in determining whether a well has produced in paying quantities, however, also protects a lessee from lessors who, by exploiting a brief period when a well has not produced a profit, seek to invalidate a lease with the hope of making a more profitable leasing arrangement. In the instant case, for example, Jedlicka seeks to invalidate a nearly 80-year-old lease based on a single-year loss which occurred more than more than 45 years ago, after which the wells resumed and continued production at a profit.\nTurning now to the specific circumstances of the instant case, Jedlicka contends that, because there was a $40 loss in 1959, the subject wells failed to produce in paying quantities, resulting in termination of the lease. The trial court, without expressly finding that a one-year period in the context of a nearly 80-year-old lease was not a \u201creasonable time period\u201d in which to conclude that the wells were not profitable, determined that \u201c[t]he evidence indicates that the lessees were operating the wells in good faith,\u201d and, on this basis, that the wells had produced in paying quantities. T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Co. and PC Exploration, Inc., No. 10362 CD 2005, at 6. Based on our review of the record, we find no error in this regard.\nAs explained above, pursuant to Young, the operator\u2019s good faith judgment is the principal focus in determining whether a lease has produced in paying quantities. Thus, as we have construed Young, the trial court properly considered Appellees\u2019 good faith judgment in its consideration of whether the wells had produced in paying quantities.\nHere, Jedlicka presented no evidence to suggest that Appellees have not operated the wells in good faith. Significantly, as Appellees emphasize, Jedlicka\u2019s own expert witness, Wayne Leeper, a petroleum geologist, testified he would have continued to operate the well that had sustained the $40 loss in 1959 because the well \u201cmakes money.\u201d N.T. Trial, 4/17/07, at 191 (R.R. at 353a). The witness further testified that the other wells on the Jedlicka property, including Well Nos. 6, 7, 8, and 9, are favorably producing. Id. at 205-05 (R.R. at 367a-368a). Accordingly, we find the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the lease was being operated in good faith and that Jedlicka failed to sustain her burden of establishing a lack of good faith by Appellees. See Jefferson County Gas Co., supra. As a result, we agree she failed to prove that the wells had not produced in paying quantities. For these reasons, we affirm the order of the Superior Court.\nOrder affirmed.\nJustice ORIE MELVIN did not participate in the consideration or decision of this case.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices BAER and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nJustice EAKIN files a concurring opinion.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\n. Hydrofracturing, or fracking, is a method used to stimulate production of a well. A specially blended liquid is pumped down the well and into a formation under pressure high enough to cause the formation to crack open, forming passages through which oil or gas can flow into the wellbore. See, e.g., U.S. Steel Corp. v. Hoge, 503 Pa. 140, 144 n. 1, 468 A.2d 1380, 1382 n. 1 (1983) (\"Hydrofracturing is the forcing of fluids under pressure into the well so as to cause a fracturing of the target stratum.\u201d).\n. The parties do not make reference to a Well No. 5.\n. Depletion schedules are used to show the operating expenses and amount of revenue generated by each well.\n. Rule 1901, titled \"Prompt Disposition of Matters; Termination of Inactive Cases,\u201d permits a court, after giving a minimum of 30 days notice, to enter an order terminating a matter where the matter has been inactive for an unreasonable period of time. Pa.R.J.A. 1901(a).\n. Shortly prior to trial, Jedlicka filed a supplemental trial memorandum arguing that Appellees breached the Findley lease by failing to meter Well No. 4 and pay a 1/8 royalty as set forth in 58 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 33-35. Section 33, titled \"Guarantee of minimum royalties,\" provides that an oil or gas lease which does not guarantee the lessor at least 1/8 royalty of all oil, natural gas, or gas removed or recovered from the property is invalid. 58 P.S. \u00a7 33. Sections 34 and 35 provide for the metering and escalation of royalties under leases which do not provide for a 1/8 royalty at the time of the April 1985 effective date of the Oil and Gas Act, 58 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 601.101 et seq. (the \"Act\u201d). Appellees objected to her filing on the basis that they did not have an opportunity to respond to or challenge the Act's constitutionality. Noting that Jedlicka had not previously raised this argument, thus depriving Appellees of an opportunity to argue the constitutionality of the Act, the trial court held that Jedlicka was precluded from raising the issue, \"without prejudice to raise it appropriately.\u201d T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Co. and PC Exploration, Inc. v. Jedlicka, No. 10362 CD 2005, unpublished memorandum opinion at 4, 2007 WL 6913660 (Indiana Cty. Common Pleas, filed July 16, 2007). This issue is not presently before this Court.\n. We note that, under the habendum clause, the Findley lease remains valid as long as \"oil or gas is produced in paying quantities,\u201d or as long as \"operations for oil or gas are being conducted thereon, including the right to drill other wells.\u201d Lease, July 2, 1928, at 1 (R.R. at 13a-14a) Thus, even if gas or oil were not produced in paying quantities, Appellees\u2019 rights under the lease would remain intact for as long as \"operations\u201d are conducted. The trial court did not address this possibility in its opinion, and, despite Appellees\u2019 assertions that \u201d[f]rom the date of the Findley Oil and Gas Lease to the present, ... operations for oil or gas have been conducted,\u201d see Appellees\u2019 Pretrial Memorandum, at 3 (R.R. at 60a), a review of the trial transcript reveals that there was some dispute, not only as to whether Appellees conducted operations for gas during the period of the lease, but also as to what activities constituted \"operations\u201d in the first instance. As a result, we are unable to determine whether the Findley lease remains valid under the second part of the habendum clause. Given our disposition of the \"in paying quantities\u201d issue, however, such determination is unnecessary.\n. The Pennsylvania Oil and Gas Association and the Independent Oil and Gas Association of Pennsylvania have filed a joint amicus brief in support of the position of Appellees, i.e., that this Court\u2019s decision in Young, requires consideration of an operator's good faith judgment when determining whether a well has produced in paying quantities.\n. In some jurisdictions, the phrase \"in commercial quantities,\" as opposed to \"in paying quantities,\u201d is used. See, e.g., Texaco, Inc. v. Fox, 228 Kan. 589, 618 P.2d 844 (1980); Landauer v. Huey, 143 Colo. 76, 352 P.2d 302 (1960).\n. Jedlicka argues in her brief to this Court that the trial court improperly held that she waived her right to challenge the validity of the Findley lease by accepting royalties from Appellees. Jedlicka contends such a finding is contrary to established law, particularly, Brown, supra. Jedlicka argues that, under Brown, when Appellees failed to produce gas in paying quantities in 1959, any interest Appellees had in the land \"lapsed as a matter of law into a tenancy at will, terminable by Ms. Jedlicka at any time,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cthere can be no waiver of any right to challenge the validity of the lease.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 16. Contrary to the terminology used by Jedlicka, the trial court in the instant case did not hold that Jedlicka waived her challenge to the validity of the lease. The trial court simply noted, in its discussion of the $40 loss suffered by T.W. Phillips in 1959, that Jedlicka \"continued to receive royalty payments per the lease for more than thirty years without asserting that the lease had expired,\u201d and, thus, received the benefit of the bargain since the inception of the Lease in 1928. T.W. Phillips Gas and Oil Co. and PC Exploration, Inc., No. 10362 CD 2005, at 5. The court then went on to address her arguments under the lease. Thus, we need not address Jedlicka\u2019s waiver contention any further.\n. Specifically, this Court concluded the trial court had \"misapprehended\u201d the scope of Kleppner v. Lemon, 176 Pa. 502, 35 A. 109 (1896). We explained in Young that Kleppner\nwas not meant to stretch the jurisdiction of equity beyond its regular and established limits, nor to blaze out any new path for proceedings on oil or gas leases, differing from ordinary remedies between lessor and lessee. It rested on fraud alleged and proved, and fraud in fact, not merely inferred from a difference of judgment between the defendant and the court as to the profitable development of the leased premises.\nYoung, 194 Pa. at 249, 45 A. at 122.\n. Jedlicka emphasizes she is not suggesting that Young be overruled. Indeed, she states: \"To be abundantly clear, [Jedlicka] is not advocating that this Court overturn Young .... It has always been [Jedlicka\u2019s] contention that Young was properly decided ... and should, therefore, be affirmed and applied to this case.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 9 n. 8.\n. The dissent suggests that our interpretation of Young is based, not on its plain language, but on how other courts have interpreted Young, and avers, \"[w]hile arguably reflecting a more modem view of 'paying quantities,\u2019 these cases are in conflict with the plain terms of Young, which impose a threshold, marginal profitability requirement.\u201d See Dissenting Opinion, at 229, 42 A.3d at 280. The dissent further posits that the decisions on which we rely \"did not elaborate on the original formulation of the \u2018paying quantities\u2019 test,\u201d set forth in Young, but rather \"effectively displaced that standard where well production was marginal or sporadic.\u201d Id. at 231, 42 A.3d at 281. The Young decision is more than 100 years old, and was decided at a time when habendum clauses were used to protect the interests of lessors, not lessees. See Swiss Oil, supra. Often, this Court is called upon to interpret established case law against new facts, which is what we do in the case sub judice. Moreover, Young failed to address the necessary aspect of the time period over which an assessment of whether a lease has made a profit should be made, and failed to specify at what point an operator\u2019s good faith judgment becomes a relevant factor; thus, we merely look to other jurisdictions for guidance in construing language similar to Young, and, at times, Young itself.\n. We note that this formulation by the Texas Supreme Court in Clifton may be traced to this Court\u2019s decision in Young. See Clifton, 325 S.W.2d at 690-91, quoting Garcia, 164 S.W.2d at 511; which in turn quotes Gypsy Oil Co. v. Marsh, 121 Okla. 135, 248 P. 329, 333 (1926); which in turn cites, inter alia, Young, 45 A. at 121.\n. Jedlicka contends, and commentators agree, that Kansas has expressly adopted a purely objective test for determining whether a well has produced in paying quantities, and has held that good faith of the operator is not a factor. Indeed, in Reese Enterprises, Inc. v. Lawson, 220 Kan. 300, 553 P.2d 885 (1976), the Kansas Supreme Court, after expressing concern that the subjective approach, which leaves the matter \u201cto the sole judgment of the lessee,\u201d does not adequately protect a lessor from \u201cthe very real factor that the lessee may be interested in preserving his interest for speculative purposes,\u201d explained:\nIn our opinion the better approach is to ... apply an objective test, where the determination of \u2018paying quantities\u2019 turns upon a mathematical computation. This approach recognizes the interest of both the lessor and the lessee, and it gives the lessor some protection when the burdens of the lease far exceed the meager royalty payments, when they fall below the customary delay rental.\nId. at 897 (citations omitted). The court acknowledged, however, that \"application of the objective standard to a determination of whether an oil and gas lease is producting [sic] oil in \u2018paying quantities' under the \u2018thereafter\u2019 clause of the lease is not free from difficulties.\u201d Id. The court further stated that its opinion \"should not be construed as requiring an eighteen month period of unprofitable operation to terminate an oil and gas lease,\u201d but that \u201c[t]he time factor in the formula ... is a question we leave open,\u201d thus suggesting that a lease may be terminated based on unprofitable operation over a period of less than eighteen months. Id. at 899.\n. Jedlicka argues that Young is consistent with decisions from other jurisdictions that have adopted an objective test for determining whether a well has produced in paying quantities. Appellant\u2019s Brief at 17 (citing, inter alia, Reese Enterprises, 553 P.2d at 897) (to avoid termination of the lease, a lessee must \"produce those quantities of oil or gas which will produce a profit, however small, over operating expenses, after eliminating the initial cost of drilling and equipping the well\u201d); Sheffield v. Exxon Corp., 424 So.2d 1297, 1303 (Ala.1983) (\"[pjaying quantities means production in quantities sufficient to yield a return in excess of operating costs, even though drilling and equipment costs may never be repaid and the undertaking considered as a whole may ultimately result in a loss\u201d); Landauer, supra (same); Kerr v. Hillenberg, 373 P.2d 66 (Okla.1962) (same); Blausey v. Stein, 61 Ohio St.2d 264, 400 N.E.2d 408 (1980) (same); Ross Explorations, Inc. supra (same); Swiss Oil Co., supra (same); and Vance v. Hurley, 215 La. 805, 41 So.2d 724 (1949) (same). However, simply characterizing Young as consistent with the law of other jurisdictions in this regard does not make it so.\nFurthermore, in several instances, Jedlicka characterizes certain jurisdictions as having expressly adopted an objective test, when, in fact, the decisions cited by Jedlicka do not support her contention. For example, in Blausey, and Vance, it was not necessary for the courts to consider the good faith of the operator because the question of whether the leases produced in paying quantities was not seriously at issue; the courts determined, as a preliminary matter, that the wells in question had paid a profit. See Blausey, 400 N.E.2d at 410 (holding that the trial court erred in including value of appellee's labor in calculating operating expenses, and thus erred in finding the well was not profitable); Vance, 41 So.2d at 728 (\"It is our opinion ... that the well drilled on the property of the plaintiffs is producing in paying quantities within the meaning and contemplation of the parties as set out in the terms of their contract of lease.\u201d). Interestingly, in Vance, the Louisiana Supreme Court took note of an apparent lack of good faith by the plaintiff-lessors:\nThe plaintiffs by their own actions showed they never entertained any doubt but that the well was producing in paying quantities, for the record shows although they were not satisfied with the production of the well, they never voiced any serious complaint with respect thereto, but, instead accepted the monthly royalty payments due thereunder during more than two years and that it was only upon the expiration of the third year, and only after they had failed in their effort to collect from their leases personally under the contemporaneous agreement, that they first entertained the idea of cancelling the lease on this ground.\nId. at 727.\nIn Ross Explorations, the Arkansas Supreme Court specifically declined to consider the appellant\u2019s assertion that the trial court erred in refusing to apply a \"reasonably prudent operator rule\u201d to determine whether a well had produced in paying quantities, noting that the argument had not been raised before the trial court and the absence of the trial court's ruling constituted a procedural bar to the court's review. 8 S.W.3d at 516.\nFinally, in Kerr, the Oklahoma Supreme Court did not apply an objective test for determining whether a well had produced in paying quantities. Indeed, it did not consider the issue of paying quantities, noting that, if the plaintiffs were entitled to prevail, it was \u201cbecause of the cessation of actual production.\u201d 373 P.2d at 69. The court ultimately concluded the temporary cessation in production did not operate to terminate the lease where the lessee made persistent and good faith efforts to repair the mechanical problems that caused the cessation of production.\n. Kansas is the only jurisdiction that has seemingly established an arbitrary time period over which to measure profits. See Reese Enterprises, supra n. 14.\n. Jedlicka also cites Buehler v. Angle, 79 P.3d 1093 (Kan.App.2003), for the proposition that nine months is a reasonable period to use in determining paying quantities; however, that decision is unpublished and non-precedential, and, in any event, the court recognized that rigid fixed terms are disfavored, and limited its conclusion to the facts of that case.\n. We note that, in cases which expressly provide for consideration of an operator's good faith judgment, some courts have held the good faith judgment of an operator should be considered as a preliminary factor in determining whether a well has produced in paying quantities, see Clifton, 325 S.W.2d at 691 (\"In determining paying quantities ... the trial court necessarily must take into consideration all matters which would influence a reasonable and prudent operator.\u201d), while others have suggested that a determination that an operator has operated a well in good faith may save a lease from termination following a determination that a well did not produce in paying quantities, see Pack, 869 P.2d at 327 (\"[T]he lease continues in existence so long as the interruption of production in paying quantities does not extend for a period longer than reasonable or justifiable in light of the circumstances involved.\u201d). In Pennsylvania, we find this to be a distinction without a difference. A lease terminates when it ceases to produce in paying quantities, but, as discussed herein, that determination incorporates an operator\u2019s good faith judgment."}
