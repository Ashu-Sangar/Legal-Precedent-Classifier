{"id": "1256083", "contents": "Opinion by\nMe. Justice Jones,\nThe defendant was indicted and tried for murder for a killing committed in the perpetration of a robbery. The jury found him guilty of murder in the first degree and fixed the penalty at death. On this appeal from the judgment of sentence, the defendant assigns two alleged trial errors. He does not assert, however, that they entitle him to a new trial. His counsel frankly state that the seven witnesses called by the defendant (he himself did not take the stand) were produced \u201cin an effort to raise the issue of punishment.\u201d Appellant\u2019s sole contention is that the matters whereof he now complains helped motivate the jury in fixing the penalty at death rather than life imprisonment and that, consequently, this court should substitute the latter penalty for the former. But, that, we are without lawful power to do.\nSection 701 of The Penal Code of 1939, P. L. 872, 18 PS \u00a74701, vests in the jury the duty of fixing the penalty between death and life imprisonment upon a conviction of first degree murder. No discretion is allowed the trial court in sentencing for first degree murder where the penalty has been fixed by the jury. Nor has this court, upon the review of a judgment of sentence for first degree murder, which was imposed in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict, any legal warrant to reduce the penalty so fixed: Commonwealth v. Taranow, 359 Pa. 342, 344-345, 59 A. 2d 53; Commonwealth v. Neill, 362 Pa. 507, 518, 67 A. 2d 276; Commonwealth v. Zietz, 364 Pa. 294, 300, 72 A. 2d 282; and Commonwealth v. Carluccetti, 369 Pa. 190, 206, 85 A. 2d 391. For this court to assume to act otherwise would unconstitutionally trench upon the province of the Board of Pardons which functions as an agency of another coordinate branch of our State government.\nIn Commonwealth v. Neill, supra, where a conviction of first degree murder with penalty of death was affirmed, our present Chief Justice, in speaking for the court, aptly concluded his opinion with the succinct statement that \u201cThe jury . . . imposed the penalty of death and, since it is they in whom the statute vests discretion to fix the penalty, it is not for this Court to review their decision.\u201d Or, as stated elsewhere by the same jurist, \u2014 \u201cWhether the jury exercised a wise discretion in fixing the penalty at death is not a matter for this Court to determine\u201d: Commonwealth v. Simmons, 361 Pa. 391, 405, 65 A. 2d 353. The lack of power in a court to change the penalty as specified by the jury for a conviction of first degree murder has been scrupulously regarded by this court ever since the duty of fixing the penalty in capital cases was first reposed in the jury by the Act of May 14, 1925, P. L. 759. Since that date, there has not been a single instance where the penalty for a first degree murder, as fixed by the jury, has been interfered with on appeal \u2014 a fact which we have heretofore remarked several times: Commonwealth v. Taranow; Commonwealth v. Zietz; and Commonwealth v. Carluccetti, supra.\nThere are two instances, neither of which is presently germane, where this court reduced the penalty of death to life imprisonment. But, in each, it was the trial court which both determined the degree of the murder and fixed the penalty therefor, following the accused\u2019s plea of guilty generally to the charge of murder; in short, the penalty was not one fixed by a jury: see Commonwealth v. Garramone, 307 Pa. 507, 515, 161 A. 733; and Commonwealth v. Irelan, 341 Pa. 43, 47, 17 A. 2d 897. These cases were concerned solely with the sentencing court\u2019s exercise of a judicial discretion which, of course, is always a subject of appellate review. Cf. also Commonwealth v. Givens, 363 Pa. 141, 147, 69 A. 2d 142; Commonwealth v. Elliott, 371 Pa. 70, 76-77, 89 A. 2d 782; and Commonwealth v. Phillips, 372 Pa. 223, 228, 93 A. 2d 455.\nHowever, if the admission or rejection of evidence at trial can be considered to have been harmful to the defendant in connection with the jury\u2019s fixing of the penalty, then we may properly reverse the judgment of sentence on the ground of trial error and remand the case for retrial: see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Jones, 355 Pa. 594, 598, 50 A. 2d 342. On that basis, we proceed to a consideration of the errors here assigned.\nThe appellant charges that the trial judge (1) did not treat adequately with the evidence of drunkenness, adduced by the defendant, in its relation to the question of penalty and (2) erred in admitting in evidence a statement made by the victim while being transported from the scene of the crime to the hospital, the effect of the testimony being to create hostility toward the defendant in the minds of the jurors.\nThe felonious assault occurred at five o\u2019clock in the morning in the course of the defendant\u2019s planned robbery of the victim. The t\u00e9stimony adduced by the defendant related, almost in its entirety, to his drinking and drunkenness the afternoon and night before the fatal shooting.: The learned trial judge, after correctly instructing th\u00e9 jury that drunkenness does\u2019not' exculp\u00e1te for the commission \u00f3f \u00bf crime; went on to explain that the one instance' in'which' drunkenness is of importance, so far as the substantive offense is concerned, is in determining the degree of the' crime \u201cwhere th\u00e9 defendant is charged with murder which involves a wilful, deliberate and premeditated killing, with specific intent to take life.\u201d The trial judge told the .jury that, if the defendant\u2019s drunkenness was such that he was incapable of forming a specific intent to take life, then the homicide could not be raised above second degree murder. But, the court further properly instructed the jury in the instant case that they had nothing to do with a specific intent to take life as the killing, here involved, was committed in the perpetration of a robbery \u2014 a fact, which the defendant\u2019s confession not only freely admitted but described in detail. The court\u2019s charge in this respect was in strict accord with our pronouncement in Commonwealth v. Simmons, supra, that \u201cWhere ... a murder is committed in the perpetration of a robbery or a burglary it is, irrespective of any question of intent, murder in the first degree, and therefore the fact that this defendant may have been drinking to excess was of no legal significance as bearing upon the degree of his crime: Commonwealth v. Wooding, 355 Pa. 555, 557, 50 A. 2d 328, 329.\u201d\nThe court next instructed the jury that \u201c. . . you have the duty to consider whether or not there are any circumstances in the happening of the crime which would mitigate the punishment and lead you to determine upon the lesser of the two punishments, namely, life imprisonment. In that connection, and in that connection only, it has been urged by the defendant . . . that he had been drinking a quantity of liquor and beer for a period of time, but the latest period of time related by any of the witnesses' was som\u00e9where around midnight of August 30th and 31st, whereas the Commonwealth seems to have established that \u25a0 the \u00e1ctual killing took place at about five o\u2019clock in' the morning, some five hours la,ter. In that connection you will have to determine what weight you will give to the testimony as to the quantity of liquor consumed by the defendant, what, if any, effect you think it had on him, from the description of his physical exhibitions, his alleged staggering, Ms alleged boisterousness, thick conversation and his entire behavior . . . .\u201d\nWhat the learned trial judge thus charged the jury was both correct and adequate. And, defendant\u2019s counsel must have so regarded it; they took no exception to it; nor did they request anything additional. What we said in Commonwealth v. Simmons, supra, is particularly apposite, \u2014 \u201cIt is true, as defendant argues, that the question of intoxication was important in connection with the determination of the penalty, and it is said that the court should have stressed this phase of the matter to the jury, but the element of intoxication and all other possibly mitigating circumstances were covered by the court\u2019s statement in its charge, several times repeated, that the jury were to determine the penalty only as the result of a full consideration of all the facts and circumstances disclosed by the testimony and all the information brought out about him at the trial; this would include his mental capacity and his state of intoxication as tending to prove a condition of diminished responsibility; it was not necessary for the trial judge to discuss in detail each of the factors, pro and con, that would properly enter into their consideration of the penalty to be imposed [citing Commonwealth v. Wooding, supra].\u201d Here, likewise, the jury were instructed that, should they find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree, then \u201cif from all the evidence in the case you find circumstances of mitigation which would lead you to inflict or impose the lesser punishment then you would have the right to impose the penalty of life imprisonment\u201d and,' further, if \u201cyou feel that the defendant is. guilty of the first degree and that there are mitigating circumstances and that the lesser punishment is required under the circumstances, it is equally your duty, and you should be equally courageous to say so by your verdict.\u201d There is obviously not the slightest merit in the appellant\u2019s first assignment.\nThe killing took place about 5 A.M. in an upstairs bedroom of the decedent\u2019s residence. The time was fixed by two residents of the neighborhood each of whom testified that he heard loud talk followed by four shots fired. The police were summoned and a police radio ear containing two policemen arrived at the scene of the crime in three to four minutes. They found the victim, Isaac Teitelbaum, staggering in his bedroom, grievously wounded. One of the shots struck Teitelbaum in the mouth, plowing his tongue and passing through and out the back of his neck, seriously injuring his tongue and the wall of his throat. He was bleeding from the mouth; there was blood down the front of his pajamas and a pool of blood on the floor. He seemed to want to say something, but it was difficult for him to talk. He was \u201cmore or less gasping\u201d as he tried to communicate something to the policeman. They started at once to take him to the hospital in their car. On the way there, a distance of some eight blocks, Teitelbaum did manage to say in the hearing of both policemen, \u2014 \u201cI offered the robber twelve dollars and begged him not to shoot.\u201d Within a few minutes after they arrived at the hospital, the physician in charge forebade the police to question Teitelbaum because of the serious hemorrhaging that had set in. He died from shock and loss of blood less than two hours later.\nOver objection of defendant\u2019s counsel, the trial judge admitted in evidence, as part of the res gestae of the shooting, the testimony of the policemen as to the deceased\u2019s statement. The ruling was manifestly correct. The statement was clearly qualified for admission in evidence under the res gestae rule. It emanated from the lips of the victim under the shock and excitement of the inflicted violence which impelled its utterance and so soon thereafter that the continuity was not broken. It was obviously spontaneous, having been uttered under circumstances which precluded the idea of reflection, premeditation or design: see Commonwealth v. Gardner, 282 Pa. 458, 465-467, 128 A. 87.\nFurthermore, admission of the statement in evidence could well be justified on the ground that it was a dying declaration. In Commonwealth v. Guida, 298 Pa. 370, 376, 148 A. 501, we said that \u201cWherever the victim of an assault is in a dying condition, and realizes it his statements concerning the cause of his injuries are admissible in evidence. That he is in such condition may be shown by the nature of his wounds and the result thereof. ... As stated in Wigmore on Evidence (2d ed.), volume 3, page 172: \u2018We may avail ourselves of any means of inferring the existence of such knowledge [that the declarant knew he was about to die]; and if, in a given case, the nature of the wound is such that the declarant must have realized his situation, our object is sufficiently attained. Such is the settled judicial attitude.\u2019 It is not necessary for the declarant to state that his declarations are made under a sense of impending dissolution [citing cases].\u201d In Commonwealth v. Knable, 369 Pa. 171, 175, 85 A. 2d 114, we more recently stated that \u201cTo validate a dying declaration it is not necessary that the wounded man expressly say that he knows that he is dying, it suffices, if at the time the declaration is made, the declarant believed he was in fact dying and that death . . . did actually ensue.\u201d And, the belief that he was dying may be inferred from the certainly fatal character of his wound and its consequent physiological effect upon him: see Commonwealth v. Puntario, 273 Pa. 501, 505, 115 A. 831; Commonwealth v. Peyton, 360 Pa. 441, 447-448, 62 A. 2d 37; and Commonwealth v. Plubell, 367 Pa. 452, 456-457, 80 A. 2d 825. The fatal wounds and attendant shock from which Teitelbaum was suffering fully warranted the inference that, when he made the statement in the hearing of the policemen, he was conscious of the imminence of his impending death. On either ground, the appellant\u2019s second assignment is equally without merit.\nWe have carefully examined the entire record and find that it contains the ingredients of first degree murder. The defendant\u2019s voluntary confession which was introduced against him at trial without objection and which he at no time repudiated or impeached in the slightest degree confirms his guilt of first degree murder. The case was painstakingly tried and was submitted to the jury in a clear, impartial and comprehensive charge. The defendant received the fair trial to which he was entitled, and the evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict.\nThe judgment of sentence is affirmed."}
