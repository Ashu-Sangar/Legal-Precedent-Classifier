{"id": "1776232", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant Miguel Guzman Martinez appeals from a judgment of sentence of six to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment imposed by the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County on a jury\u2019s verdict of guilty of murder of the third degree. Appellant challenges the sufficiency and weight of the evidence to sustain his conviction for murder of the third degree, his competency to stand trial, trial counsel\u2019s failure to raise an insanity defense, numerous trial court rulings and the severity of his sentence. As none of appellant\u2019s claims merits relief, we affirm.\nAppellant was tried on a charge of murder generally for the shooting death on April 3, 1973, of Candida Candelaria, on the front porch of Mrs. Candelaria\u2019s home. Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth as verdict winner, the evidence established that, approximately an hour before the offense, the victim\u2019s daughter overheard a telephone conversation between the victim and appellant in which appellant said that \u201che was going to go to [the victim\u2019s] house and hit [the victim] and put her in the hospital.\u201d Appellant arrived at the victim\u2019s home shortly after 4:00 p. m., and said to the daughter, \u201cI just came here to kill your mother.\u201d Appellant then took a .38 caliber revolver from his car and fired several shots, killing the victim. After the shooting appellant argued with the victim\u2019s daughter and then drove to the home of a friend, a local constable. He gave the constable the gun and asked to be taken to the police department. Upon appellant\u2019s arrest, a .38 caliber live cartridge was found in his pants pocket during a pat down search of his person. After being taken into custody, appellant consented to a dermal nitrate test, which subsequently showed gunpowder patterns on his hands.\nThe defense introduced expert testimony that at the time of the offense appellant was suffering from hypertension and chronic alcohol abuse. Appellant testified that he had drunk several \u201cshots\u201d of whiskey and several beers during the morning and afternoon immediately preceding the shooting. In his testimony, appellant attributed the shooting to an accident. He said that, although he could not recall the shooting itself, he recalled having seen the daughter come out of the house carrying the revolver. The daughter pointed the gun at him, and he then grasped the daughter\u2019s hand to push the gun away. After the gun had discharged, shooting the victim, the daughter threw the gun to the ground. According to appellant, he picked up the gun and took it with him to the home of his friend, the constable.\nContrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the evidence was clearly sufficient to prove the elements of murder of the third degree beyond a reasonable doubt. Nor is the jury\u2019s verdict against the weight of the evidence. Direct and circumstantial evidence established that appellant had committed the killing and the requisite malice could properly have been inferred from appellant\u2019s use of a deadly weapon against a vital part of the victim\u2019s body. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Roberts, 496 Pa. 428, 435-437 A.2d 948, 951-52 (1981) (citing cases).\nThe trial court\u2019s determination that appellant was competent to stand trial is fully supported by the record. It is well established that\n\u201cthe test to be applied in determining the legal sufficiency of [a defendant\u2019s] mental capacity to stand trial .. . is .. . his ability to comprehend his position as one accused of murder and to cooperate with his counsel in making a rational defense. See Commonwealth v. Moon [383 Pa. 18, 117 A.2d 96 (1955)], and Commonwealth ex rel. Hilberry v. Maroney [417 Pa. 534, 544, 207 A.2d 794, 799 (1965)]. Or stated another way, did he have sufficient ability at the pertinent time to consult with his lawyers with a reasonable degree of rational understanding, and have a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him. See Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402 [80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824] (1960). Otherwise, the proceedings would lack due process: Bishop v. United States, 350 U.S. 961 [76 S.Ct. 440, 100 L.Ed. 835] (1956).\u201d\nCommonwealth ex rel. Hilberry v. Maroney, 424 Pa. 493, 495, 227 A.2d 159, 160 (1967). Accord, Commonwealth v. Tyson, 485 Pa. 344, 349, 402 A.2d 995, 997 (1979); Commonwealth v. Davis, 459 Pa. 575, 577-78, 330 A.2d 847, 848 (1975); Commonwealth v. Kennedy, 451 Pa. 483, 487-88, 305 A.2d 890, 892 (1973). It is equally well established that \u201cthe person asserting mental incompetence to stand trial has the burden of proving incompetency by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d Commonwealth v. Kennedy, supra. Accord, Commonwealth v. Davis, supra. Moreover, \u201cthe determination of competency rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d Commonwealth v. Ware, 459 Pa. 334, 356, 329 A.2d 258, 269 (1974) (footnote omitted). The testimony of both the psychiatrist who testified for appellant and the psychiatrist who testified for the Commonwealth at the pretrial hearing on appellant\u2019s competency provides ample basis for the trial court\u2019s finding that, notwithstanding appellant\u2019s cardiovascular problems and hypertension, appellant was capable of understanding the nature and objective of the proceedings against him and of cooperating with counsel in the presentation of his defense.\nAppellant\u2019s allegation that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise an insanity defense at trial is equally without support on the record. This claim, as well as two other claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, was raised in post-trial motions by present appellate counsel, who was appointed to represent appellant after the close of trial. At an evidentiary hearing on these claims, trial counsel testified that, on the basis of a pretrial evidentiary hearing on the issue of appellant\u2019s criminal responsibility, she had concluded that an insanity defense would not be successful. Not only had the trial court concluded that \u201c[t]he defendant knew the nature and quality of the acts which occurred on April 3rd, 1977, and knew that they were wrong and against the law,\u201d but also, in counsel\u2019s view, the Commonwealth had presented psychiatric testimony that, if presented at trial, would have seriously damaged an insanity defense. On this record it is clear that counsel\u2019s decision to pursue defenses of intoxication and accidental death rather than an insanity defense, a decision with which appellant concurred at the time of trial, \u201chad some reasonable basis designed to effectuate [her] client\u2019s interest.\u201d Commonwealth ex rel. Washington v. Maroney, 427 Pa. 599, 604, 235 A.2d 349, 352 (1967) (emphasis in original).\nAppellant\u2019s additional claims of error are similarly without merit. At trial a foundation was laid for the introduction into evidence of the revolver and cartridges used at the time of the offense. Contrary to appellant\u2019s position, this evidence was not inadmissible simply because the Commonwealth had not produced and identified the revolver and cartridges at the hearing on appellant\u2019s suppression motion, in which appellant had challenged the constitutionality of their seizure. The testimony presented at the suppression hearing of three Commonwealth witnesses regarding the circumstances under which the revolver and cartridges had been obtained was sufficient to satisfy the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cburden of going forward with the evidence and of establishing that the challenged evidence was not obtained in violation of the defendant's rights.\u201d Pa.R.Crim.P. 323(h). See Commonwealth v. Christman, 432 Pa. 455, 247 A.2d 451 (1968) (printed text of confession not required for voluntariness hearing).\nIn permitting the Commonwealth to recall Detective Matz, a witness in the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief, to rebut appellant\u2019s testimony regarding the manner in which the revolver was fired and appellant\u2019s state of intoxication, the court acted within its discretion to regulate the order for the presentation of evidence. See Commonwealth v. Koch, 446 Pa. 469, 288 A.2d 791 (1972). So, too, the court properly acted within its discretion in permitting Dr. Sadoff, the Commonwealth\u2019s psychiatric expert, to take into consideration not only his own examination of appellant but also the testimony of appellant and appellant\u2019s expert psychiatric witness in expressing an opinion on appellant\u2019s mental capacity at the time of the offense.\nAppellant\u2019s challenge to his sentence must also fail. The trial court\u2019s imposition of sentence, supported by a statement of reasons in accordance with Commonwealth v. Riggins, 474 Pa. 115, 377 A.2d 140 (1977), reflects a thorough consideration of appellant\u2019s character and record. See Commonwealth v. Martin, 466 Pa. 118, 351 A.2d 650 (1976). In imposing a minimum sentence of six years\u2019 and a maximum sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment, with credit of 990 days for time served, the court took into account not only the offense for which appellant was found guilty, but also appellant\u2019s age, poor physical health, psychiatric condition, absence of prior criminal record, and need for continued supervision during his recovery from alcoholism. The court\u2019s sound exercise of its discretion may not be disturbed.\nJudgment of sentence affirmed.\nNIX, J., concurs in the result.\n. Appellant was represented at trial by counsel from the Public Defender\u2019s Office of Berks County. Subsequent to trial and before the completion of post-trial motion proceedings, counsel resigned from the Public Defender\u2019s Office and ceased to represent appellant. Present counsel, also from the Public Defender\u2019s Office, joined the office after trial counsel\u2019s resignation had become effective. This record demonstrates that, although appellant was entitled to be represented on his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel by counsel not associated with the office of his trial counsel, appellant has chosen to proceed on his claims of ineffective assistance with the representation of present counsel. See Commonwealth v. Gardner, 480 Pa. 7, 389 A.2d 58 (1978).\n. Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the trial court acted within its discretion in crediting the testimony of Dr. Sadoff, the psychiatrist who testified on behalf of the Commonwealth at the pretrial hearing. Dr. Sadoff stated, in part:\n\u201cMy opinion is that in my examination and my review of all the tests, I find no evidence to indicate that he could not tell that what he was doing was wrong.\nI believe that he did [know the nature and quality of the act] in the sense that the nature of the act, to me, is taking the gun in hand, pointing it at another human being and shooting, knowing that there are bullets that can hit the other person. That is the nature of the act. The quality of the act is what is accomplished by such an act; that is that the other person will be severely hurt or killed, and I believe that he knew both the nature and quality of his act at the time he shot.\u201d\nSee generally Commonwealth v. Hicks, 483 Pa. 305, 396 A.2d 1183 (1979).\n. The remaining claims of ineffective assistance concern trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the court\u2019s instruction to the jury on the charge of voluntary manslaughter. The court instructed the jury, in relevant part: \u201cA person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits voluntary manslaughter if, at the time of the killing, he is acting under a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by the individual killed or by another whom the actor endeavors to kill, but negligently or accidentally causes the death of the individual killed.\u201d As this instruction reflects the statutory requirements for voluntary manslaughter, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503, appellant\u2019s claim that counsel should have objected to the reference to \u201cserious provocation\u201d is without merit. Appellant\u2019s second claim is that counsel should have requested the court to instruct the jury to consider whether the victim had aroused sufficient passion in appellant to support a verdict of voluntary manslaughter. The court did instruct the jury to consider whether the victim\u2019s daughter had seriously provoked appellant into sudden and intense passion, causing him to endeavor to kill the daughter but resulting in the negligent or accidental death of the victim. In light of the dearth of evidence at trial regarding any provocation by the victim, counsel\u2019s failure to make such a request, as well as her failure to object to the court\u2019s comment that \u201cthere is no evidence at all that [the victim] did anything except be there,\u201d had a reasonable basis. See Commonwealth v. Rice, 456 Pa. 90, 318 A.2d 705 (1974).\n. The trial court also acted within its discretion in giving a cautionary instruction to the jury, and refusing to grant a mistrial, when the prosecutor improperly assumed facts not in evidence in questioning a witness. The court\u2019s refusal to give all appellant\u2019s requests for charge to the jury was similarly within the court\u2019s discretion, as was the court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s request for daily transcripts."}
