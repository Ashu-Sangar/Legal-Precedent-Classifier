{"id": "3788185", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice BALDWIN.\nThe issue presented in this case is whether collateral civil consequences of criminal acts, in this instance suspensions of operating privileges (ie., driver\u2019s licenses), should be merged to accord with the merger of the underlying criminal convictions from which the collateral civil consequences flow. Although this is a question of first impression for this Court, the lower courts of this Commonwealth have merged such suspensions at least since the Commonwealth Court decided Zimmerman v. Commonwealth, 759 A.2d 953 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.2000) (en banc), alloc, denied, 567 Pa. 753, 788 A.2d 382 (2001). We find that this is the result intended by the subject statute, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532. Thus we affirm the Commonwealth Court\u2019s decision.\nMatthew Steven Drabic (Drabic) was involved in a motor vehicle accident on November 27, 2003. A passenger in his vehicle died as a result of the accident. Drabic pled guilty to fourteen offenses. Subsequently, the Director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation\u2019s Bureau of Driver Licensing (PennDOT) issued the following series of suspensions, pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1532 (Suspension of operating privilege), sending an individual notice to Drabic for each:\nLength of Operator's Criminal Offense Privilege Suspension\n75 Pa.C.S. 5 3735 (homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence) _ 3 years_\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735.1 (aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence) 1 year\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3732 (homicide by vehicle) 3 years\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3742.1 (Accidents involving death or personal injury while not properly licensed) 1 year\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731 (Driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance) 1 year\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308 (offenses related to alcohol) 2 years\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543(b) (driving while operating privilege suspended) 1 year\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3361 (driving vehicle at safe speed) 10 days\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3736 (reckless driving) 6 months\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3362 (Maximum speed limits) 20 days\n12 years, 6 months Total: and 30 days\nOn August 11, 2004, Drabic filed an appeal with the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County for all of the suspensions except those imposed for the driving with a suspended license (\u00a7 1543(b)) and offenses related to alcohol (\u00a7 6308) violations. A de novo hearing was conducted on February 9, 2005 by the trial court, during which Drabic conceded that the suspension for \u00a7 3735, homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence (homicide by vehicle-DUI), was proper. Drabic argued that all the other suspensions of his driver\u2019s license should have merged into that greater offense.\nThe trial court agreed in part and merged driving under the influence (\u00a7 3731) (DUI) and aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence (\u00a7 3735.1) (AA-DUI) into homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence (\u00a7 3735). The Court of Common Pleas merged the reckless driving (\u00a7 3736) violation into the homicide by vehicle (\u00a7 3732) violation. All remaining statutory appeals were denied. Based upon this, the trial court reduced Drabic\u2019s total driver\u2019s license suspension by two years and six months.\nPennDOT appealed these rulings to the Commonwealth Court. In a memorandum opinion, a panel of the Commonwealth Court affirmed in part and reversed in part. Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Drabic, Nos. 738-739 CD 2005, slip op. at 7, 883 A.2d 730 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct. September 9, 2005). In its opinion, the Commonwealth Court first declined PennDOT\u2019s express invitation to overrule Zimmerman. In Zimmerman, the Commonwealth Court faced an analytically identical question. \u201cThe issue before the court is whether [criminal convictions] merge for purposes of operating privilege suspension[s]\u201d. Zimmerman, 759 A.2d at 957.\nJudge Pellegrini, writing for the panel in the instant case, stated that Zimmerman \u201cremains binding, precedential law.\u201d Id. at 5. Noting that this Court denied Allocatur in Zimmer man, Judge Pellegrini explained that the Commonwealth Court had \u201cno inclination\u201d to overrule its own precedent. Id. Before this Court is PennDOT\u2019s challenge to the merger of Drabic\u2019s operator\u2019s privilege suspension imposed for his conviction of aggravated assault while driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735.1) and the suspension imposed for his conviction of homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735).\nThe parties do not dispute the facts in the case sub judice, rather, the question presented is a pure question of law. Our standard of review is de novo. Seven Springs Farm, Inc. v. Croker, 569 Pa. 202, 208 n. 1, 801 A.2d 1212, 1216 n. 1 (2002). Questions of law are accorded a plenary scope of review. McNeil v. Jordan, 586 Pa. 413, 894 A.2d 1260, 1268 (2006).\nIn the first instance, the parties disagree as to whether the doctrine of merger even applies in the instant context, i.e., when collateral civil consequences are imposed. We need not directly address this question, since we believe the plain language of the statute directs that only a single suspension can be imposed based upon a single criminal episode. Regardless of whether the Commonwealth is correct, and the doctrine of merger is not properly applied to collateral civil consequences, or whether Appellee properly directs our attention to the statutory construction act and Commonwealth v. Anderson, 538 Pa. 574, 650 A.2d 20 (1994) (holding that the doctrine of merger is a rule of statutory construction), the inquiry in either event must be based on the language of the statute at issue.\nThe key language in the subsections at issue is \u201cthe driver\u2019s conviction ... any of the following offenses.\u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532. Recently, in Freundt v. Commonwealth, 584 Pa. 283, 883 A.2d 503 (2005), we construed \u00a7 1532(c) explaining that where the legislature used the separate terms \u201cconviction\u201d and \u201coffense\u201d it must have intended for the words to have different meanings. Thus, while the merger of the suspensions of operating privileges under 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1532(a) and 1532(a.l) is an issue of first impression for this Court, in Freundt we explained that, in the context of \u00a7 1532(e), \u201cwhen there is a conviction, the appropriate [license] suspension shall be determined by whether or not the conviction stemmed from a single criminal episode, or multiple criminal episodes.\u201d Freundt at 290, 883 A.2d at 507 (citations omitted).\nMs. Freundt (Freundt) pled guilty to sixteen counts of acquiring or obtaining a controlled substance by misrepresentation, fraud, forgery, deception or subterfuge (35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(12)). PennDOT sent Freundt sixteen separate notices that her driving privileges were being suspended pursuant to 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(c). Freundt appealed. The Court of Common Pleas of Carbon County denied the appeal and reinstated the suspensions, indicating that it was unable to determine whether there were or were not multiple violations involved in Freundt\u2019s convictions.\nFreundt then appealed to the Commonwealth Court, which concluded that with respect to \u00a7 1532(c) and its predecessor, 35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(m), a single criminal episode results in a single license suspension. Freundt at 290, 883 A.2d at 507. Like the instant case, in Freundt, PennDOT asserted that the plain language of the statute required it to impose separate suspensions for each conviction. Id. at 287, 883 A.2d at 505. The Commonwealth Court disagreed based upon its own line of cases that has indicated that separate criminal episodes are required in order for PennDOT to impose multiple suspensions. Freundt v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 804 A.2d 706, 710-12 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.2002). PennDOT then appealed to this Court.\nRelying on our interpretation of the statute, we affirmed, because the statute said that the operating privilege of a person would be suspended after PennDOT had received a record of \u201cthe person\u2019s conviction of any offense involving the possession, sale, delivery ... of any controlled substance .... \u201d 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532(c) (emphasis added). Chief Justice Cappy, writing for a majority, pointed out that we must presume that since the General Assembly used both the word \u201cconviction\u201d and the word \u201coffense,\u201d it must have meant for the words to have separate meanings. Freundt, 584 Pa. at 289-90, 883 A.2d at 506-07. This Court also noted that, while the issue of whether one or multiple suspensions should result from a single criminal episode was an issue of first impression for the Supreme Court, there was a long line of cases from the Commonwealth Court which consistently interpreted \u00a7 1532(c) as requiring that only one suspension issue for each criminal episode. Id. (citing Gregg v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 851 A.2d 253 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.2004); Carter v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 838 A.2d 869 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.2003); Yadzinski v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 723 A.2d 263 (Pa.Cmlthw.Ct.1999); Lauer v. Department of Transp., 666 A.2d 779 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.1995); Brosius v. Department of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing, 664 A.2d 199 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.1995); Heisterkamp v. DOT, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 165 Pa.Cmwlth. 128, 644 A.2d 262 (1994); Department of Transp., Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Hardy, 160 Pa.Cmwlth. 427, 635 A.2d 230 (1993)). Therefore, in Freundt, we concluded that based on the plain language of the statute \u201cconviction of any offense\u201d as used in \u00a7 1532(c) refers to a single criminal episode.\nThe same statute, \u00a7 1532, is at issue in the case sub judice, but different subsections are implicated. Nonetheless, in the subsections scrutinized here, the Legislature again discusses \u201cthe driver\u2019s conviction of ... any of the following offenses.\u201d As we did in Freundt, we find that the Legislature\u2019s use of the separate terms \u201cconviction\u201d and \u201coffenses\u201d to be significant. Specifically, \u201cconviction of ... any of the following offenses\u201d stems from a single criminal episode. We see no reason to depart from our reasoning in Freundt. We acknowledge that the analysis in Freundt was simplified by the more generalized grammatical construct of subsection (c), i.e., \u201cconviction of any offense involving the possession, sale, [etc.] of any controlled substance,\u201d as opposed to the slightly different grammatical construct of the two subsections at issue here ((a) and (a.l)), but see no reason to arrive at a different result as the key language remains constant: \u201cconviction of ... any ... offense[ ].\u201d\nMoreover, as was the case in Freundt, here again the Commonwealth Court merged the suspensions pursuant to a long line of its cases, the most prominent of which is Zimmerman v. Commonwealth, 759 A.2d 958 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.2000) In Zimmerman, the licensee pled guilty to ten offenses including DUI and AA-DUI. Id. at 955. PennDOT issued both a suspension and a revocation of Zimmerman\u2019s operating privilege pursuant to the version of \u00a7 1532 then in effect. Id. The trial court concluded that because all of the elements of DUI were also elements of AA-DUI, the suspensions for those two offenses merge in the same manner as the underlying convictions merge. PennDOT appealed, relying upon a series of cases from the Commonwealth Court where license suspensions were not merged. The Commonwealth Court found these cases inapposite, indicating that \u201cthe violators in these cases either committed offenses with distinct elements or committed offenses arising from separate acts.\u201d Id. at 957 (citing Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Lescisin, 156 Pa.Cmwlth. 666, 628 A.2d 1208 (1993); Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing v. Maddesi, 138 Pa.Cmwlth. 467, 588 A.2d 580 (1991); Department of Transportation, Bureau of Traffic Safety v. Bishop, 102 Pa.Cmwlth. 483, 518 A.2d 897 (1986); Parks v. Commonwealth, 40 Pa.Cmwlth. 544, 398 A.2d 230 (1979)).\nIndeed, the Zimmerman court noted that it had applied the doctrine of merger in 1991 to the allocation of points to a licensee. Maddesi, 138 Pa.Cmwlth. at 474, 588 A.2d at 583. The Commonwealth Court recognized in Maddesi that \u00a7 1535(b) prohibited \u201cthe separate assignment of points for multiple violations arising from the same act only where proof of one violation also proves another violation.\u201d Id. Therefore, the Commonwealth Court explained that where any underlying convictions would merge, the collateral civil consequences, in this case \u201cpoints\u201d on a license, cannot be separately assessed. Id.\nThus, the Commonwealth Court concluded that \u201c[sjeparate administrative penalties for multiple convictions arising from the same transaction are prohibited where the convictions are greater and lesser included offenses.\u201d Zimmerman, 759 A.2d at 957 (citing Xenakis v. Department of Transportation, Bureau of Driver Licensing, 702 A.2d 572 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct.1997)).\nPennDOT argues that the Commonwealth Court\u2019s determination was erroneous, in that operator\u2019s privilege suspensions should not be subjected to the doctrine of merger of related offenses, because the doctrine has no bearing on non-criminal sanctions. PennDOT encourages us to delve into the statutory construction statutes, and the legislative intent behind the license suspensions, to determine whether merger should apply-\nWithout contesting the non-criminal nature of the license suspensions, Appellee Drabic notes that the Legislature was free at the time it wrote \u00a7 1532 to provide either that merger should or should not apply to these provisions and it chose not to do that. Indeed, as Drabic noted in his brief, \u201c[i]t is presumed that members of the General Assembly and their constituents are aware that the doctrine of merger is being applied in license suspension cases. It is the function of the General Assembly to enact laws to prohibit such merger if, in fact, that is the legislative intent.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 2.\nWe recognize that the doctrine of merger of related offenses has its roots in the double jeopardy provisions of both the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. Double jeopardy protections forbid the imposition of multiple punishments for a single criminal act that constitute greater and lesser-included offenses. Commonwealth v. Buffington, 574 Pa. 29, 39, 828 A.2d 1024, 1028 (2003). However, merger has been applied in the related context of administrative consequences in this Commonwealth for over a decade. While the underpinnings of the application of merger in this context may not lie in double jeopardy, we find that the Legislature articulated no proscription against collateral civil consequences merging along with the underlying criminal convictions.\nFinally, PennDOT also advances a public policy argument, contending that the intent of the Legislature in providing for these collateral civil consequences, unlike their criminal counterparts, is not to punish the driver but rather to protect the public from these drivers. While this argument is noble, it is unpersuasive. We cannot accept PennDOT\u2019s argument that public safety concerns militate a conclusion that, under \u00a7 1532, operator\u2019s privilege suspensions do not merge given our interpretation of the plain language of \u00a7 1532 and the Legislature\u2019s intent.\nThe sanctions at issue here, related to the convictions for AA \u2014 DUI and homicide by vehicle \u2014 DUI, cannot be construed as PennDOT suggests. Here, the suspensions derived directly from the underlying criminal convictions and there is no question that those underlying criminal convictions merge. The decision of the Commonwealth Court is affirmed.\nChief Justice CAPPY and Justice CASTILLE and BAER join the opinion.\nJustice NEWMAN files a dissenting opinion in which Justice EAKIN joins.\nJustice SAYLOR files a dissenting opinion.\n. The charges were: (1) homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735); (2) aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735.1); (3) homicide by vehicle/safe speed (75 Pa.C.S..\u00a7 3732); (4) homicide by vehicle/reckless driving (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3732); (5) accidents involving death or personal injury while not properly licensed (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3742.1); (6) involuntary manslaughter (18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2504); (7) driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731); (8) recklessly endangering another person (18 Pa.C.S \u00a7 2705); (9) offenses related to alcohol (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6308); (10) driving with a suspended license (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543(b)); (11) driving on roadways laned for traffic (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3309); (12) driving vehicle at safe speed (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3361); (13) reckless driving (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3736); and (14) maximum speed limits (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3362).\n. (a) One-year suspension. \u2014 The department shall suspend the operating privilege of any driver for one year upon receiving a certified record of the driver's conviction of or an adjudication of delinquency based on any of the following offenses:\n(1) Any felony in the commission of which a court determines that a vehicle was essentially involved.\n(3) Any violation of the following provisions:\nSection 3735.1 (relating to aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence).\nSection 3742 (relating to accidents involving death or personal injury while not properly licensed).\nSection 3742.1 (relating to accidents involving death or personal injury while hot properly licensed).\nSection 7111 (relating to dealing in titles and plates for stolen vehicles).\nSection 7121 (relating to false application for certificate of title or registration).\nSection 7122 (relating to altered, forged or counterfeit documents and plates).\n(a.l) Three-year suspension. \u2014 The department shall suspend the operating privilege of any driver for three years upon receiving a certified record of the driver\u2019s conviction of or an adjudication of delinquency based on a violation of any of the following offenses:\n(1) Any violation of section 3732 (relating to homicide by vehicle).\n(2) Any violation of section 3735 (relating to homicide by vehicle while driving under influence).\n75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1532.\n. The Commonwealth Court did not affirm the entire holding of the trial court. Rather, it determined that an additional six-month suspension for reckless driving was warranted. It modified the trial court's order to impose this additional suspension, but otherwise affirmed the trial court\u2019s rulings on each of Drabic\u2019s appeals. Commonwealth v. Drabic, Nos. 738-739 C.D.2005,- slip op. at 6-7, 883 A.2d 730 (Pa.Cmwlth.Ct. September 9, 2005). The reckless driving suspension is not at issue in the instant appeal.\n. The Commonwealth Court also disagreed with PennDOT\u2019s contention that Zimmerman did not apply because, on the face of documents PennDOT received after Drabic was convicted, there was no way to know that the victim of the aggravated assault by vehicle while driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735.1) was the same victim for the homicide by vehicle while driving under the influence (75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3735). In other words, PennDOT contended that it could impose the separate sanctions because, as far as PennDOT knew, there was more than one victim thus taking the facts outside of the rule in Zimmerman. The Commonwealth Court characterized these contentions as disingenuous, noting that in oral argument to the trial court it was clear that there was only one victim. The Commonwealth Court rejected this argument on waiver grounds under Pa.R.A.P. 302. PennDOT did not raise this issue here.\n. U.S. Const, amend. V.\n. Pa. Const, art. 1 \u00a7 10."}
