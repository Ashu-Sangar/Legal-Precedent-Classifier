{"id": "1152649", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Linn,\nIn the perpetration of a burglary during the nigbt of November 12, 1932, appellant, Stabinsky and an accomplice, Tetrosky (appellant in No. 313, the nest case), brutally assaulted Mary Malinowski, inflicting injury resulting in death. Both were arrested shortly thereafter, and, taken to the Malinowski residence, described the crime in revolting detail. Statements by them to the police and assistant district attorneys were put in evidence. The jury found appellant guilty of murder of the first degree with the death penalty.\nHe complains of error in overruling a challenge for cause made on the ground that a juror\u2019s answers disclosed prejudicial opinion of appellant\u2019s guilt. The trial judge thought there was no basis for the criticism suggested. We have considered the subject in the light of the familiar rule (see Commonwealth v. Roddy, 184 Pa. 274, 39 A. 211, and cases considering the subject, down to Commonwealth v. Crow, 303 Pa. 91, 100, 154 A. 283) and must dismiss the assignment as without merit.\nComplaint is also made of a portion of the charge stating that appellant struck the victim with an iron bar. If this was a misstatement of fact that might be considered prejudicial, counsel should have called the attention of the court to it for correction before the jury retired. But it is not clear that it was a mistake; the murderers broke their black jack on the head of the woman and then descended to the cellar and \u201cfound an iron down there,\u201d and, returning to the woman\u2019s room (in the words of the statement to the officers, put in evidence) \u201cwe socked the girl with the iron.\u201d At this point in the narrative, Tetrosky interrupted with, \u201cYou did not hit her with the iron,\u201d and appellant added, \u201cI did not hit her with the iron.\u201d The jury was, however, specifically instructed that it must be governed by its own recollection of the evidence and not by that of the judge. Under all the evidence on the subject, of which, we have quoted only part, the fact was for the jury; if a mistake was made, the error was harmless in the circumstances disclosed by the record.\nComplaint is made of an instruction that, if appellant was found guilty of first-degree murder, he, \u201cin the opinion of the court, deserves the maximum penalty under the law.\u201d But that was not all that was said on the subject; the jury was specifically instructed that the punishment was \u201ca matter entirely for your discretion. You are not bound by any opinion the court may have expressed.\u201d An expression of opinion, so qualified, is not improper: Com. v. Nafus, 303 Pa. 418, 420, 154 A. 485.\nThere is no foundation for the assignment of error \u201cin placing undue stress on the evidence of the Commonwealth and in minimizing the evidence for the defendant.\u201d The evidence included testimony of a number of members of the Malinowski household, the officers who arrested the murderers, the officers to whom they made their statements, and the stenographic report of the accounts of their crime. The only witness who testified for defendant was a physician. The court did not minimize the effect of this physician\u2019s testimony. He was called as an expert and testified concerning his examination of appellant, gave his sources of information, etc., and the opinion formed by him. He testified that appellant \u201cbegan \u2014 he is beginning to show a split personality, and I felt he was beginning to show evidences of an incipient schizophrenia, with the psychopathic tendency, and therefore I combined the two words, a schizophrenic-psychopath.\u201d He also said that disease is \u201cnot an insanity.\u201d The commission of the crime was not denied and it was not claimed that appellant was insane when the crime was committed or when arraigned and tried. The jury was instructed that the doctor testified \u201cthat this defendant could distinguish between light and wrong, but the defendant was only partially responsible.\u201d Two points for charge, presented on behalf of appellant, were affirmed, as follows:\n\u201c3. If the jury believe the testimony of Dr. Winkelman, they may take this testimony into consideration in fixing the degree of punishment, if they find defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.\u201d\n\u201c4. If the jury believe the testimony of Dr. Winkelman, they may take this testimony into consideration along with all the other testimony in the case, in fixing the degree of punishment, if they find defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.\u201d\nAppellant also complains that the learned court excluded other evidence of mitigating circumstances that should have been received for the purpose of enabling the jury to determine whether, if found guilty, appellant, should be sentenced to death or to life imprisonment, as provided for by the Act of May 14, 1925, P. L. 759, 18 PS 2222. This complaint is presented in the sixth assignment of error: \u201cWe offer to prove by this witness [appellant\u2019s mother] facts in the history and behavior of the defendant, on the basis of which facts, together with other facts which will be testified to by other witnesses, and together with an examination of the defendant, and an observation of his conduct in court, and after hearing all of the evidence presented here in court today, Dr. Winkelman will state that in his opinion the defendant, at the time of the alleged occurrence for which the defendant is now on trial, and for some time prior thereto, was and now is a schizophrenic-psychopath, and therefore irresponsible for his actions.\u201d The offer was so defective in substance as to justify the court in sustaining the Commonwealth\u2019s objection. What were the facts which it was proposed to prove? Instead of offering merely to prove facts \u201con the basis of which together with other facts which will be testified to by other witnesses......,\u201d there should have been a brief statement of the facts proposed to be proved so that the court could determine whether they were relevant, for, unless relevant, they could not be received. And it is to be noted, so far as the offer referred to Dr. Winkelman\u2019s \u201cobservation of [appellant\u2019s] conduct in court,\u2019\u2019 that the appellant had the benefit of it, because the doctor testified that his opinion was in part based on his observation of the defendant in court. The doctor also stated that he had considered the history of the appellant as received from his parents. It was not an offer of evidence, in part relevant and in part irrelevant, which, in a prosecution for homicide, might require the judge to separate the good from the bad (cf. Com. v. Colandro, 231 Pa. 343, 348, 80 A. 571) but an offer that gave no indication of relevance. The record appears to show that the judge thought that counsel proposed to submit lay evidence of insanity, although the defense of insanity was not made, and suggested that the lay witness be called after the doctor had testified. The doctor testified that appellant was suffering from the mental disease described but was not insane within the rule applied in criminal prosecutions in this State. Counsel for appellant said: \u201cWe do not rely upon the testimony of Dr. Winkelman to excuse the crime, but we do rely upon it \u2014 we do think it ought to be submitted to the jury for the purpose of measuring the punishment that might be imposed upon \u2014 they might in fact impose upon the defendant, in fairness and mercy. The court: Then the sole purpose of Dr. Winkelman\u2019s testimony is for mitigation of penalty? Mr. Walsh: Yes. The court: And for no other purpose. Mr. Walsh: No.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth then moved to strike out the evidence of the doctor on the ground that it should not be received but the court refused the motion and affirmed the points for charge quoted above, submitted on appellant\u2019s behalf.\nIn refusing a new trial, the learned trial judge said that the doctor\u2019s evidence was \u201cpresumably offered to show mental irresponsibility [by which we understand that he meant insanity]. When admitted, it failed to approximate the legal standard which prompted defendant\u2019s counsel to oppose its exclusion on the basis of its competency in mitigation of punishment...... As it is our firm opinion that such an independent inquiry is not permissible under the Act of 1925, we did not allow the Commonwealth to offer rebuttal evidence on the defendant\u2019s mental condition, thereby joining issue other than the one framed by the indictment and the plea of the defendant. True, our courts have admitted evidence of prior convictions, but to permit, under the Act of 1925, an issue of mere mental weakness may result in opening a large domain wherein maudlin sympathy will reign and justice perish......\u201d\nThe evidence fully supports the verdict in both its aspects. But we must take this opportunity of saying that we differ from the view of the learned trial judge that appellant was not entitled to have the doctor\u2019s evidence go to the jury, as it did, in possible mitigation of penalty. The Act of 1925 imposes on the jury a specific duty, \u2014 the duty of fixing the penalty by its verdict. As the penalty may be death or life imprisonment, a serious responsibility devolves on the jury; to perform its duty, the jury is entitled to be informed. Since the passage of the statute, this court has affirmed convictions with the death penalty in which not only prior convictions of other crimes were put in evidence, but in which alleged confessions of other offenses were received. This procedure is necessary, as was said in Com. v. Dague, 302 Pa. 13, 15, 152 A. 839, \u201cto enable the jury to know what manner of man the defendant was, if they should find him guilty of murder of the first degree, when it came to the exercise of their discretion on the question of his punishment under the act......\u201d\nNow if such evidence may be received against a man, he must be given opportunity to deny it, for, in any view, the fact of identity may be involved. A rule would command little respect if it permitted the State to show what was bad about a man for the purpose of persuading the jury to inflict a more severe penalty, without at the same time permitting the defendant to show that he was suffering with a mental disease that might affect his conduct, though not in fact insane as the term is applied in the criminal law. In sentencing prisoners, wise judges invariably consider elements in mitigation and extenuation. In Com. v. Williams, 307 Pa. 134, 155, 160 A. 602, we held that mitigating circumstances may be considered by the jury in fixing the penalty. \u201cDiminished responsibility is a scientific fact, scientifically established and capable of being analyzed.\u201d The subject of the mental condition of persons charged with crime was considered by the legislature at its last session and resulted in the statute approved May 2, 1933. The title is \u201cAn act providing for the deferring of sentences in certain cases pending the mental examination of defendants; authorizing trial judges to require psychiatrists employed by the Department of Welfare or County or State mental hospitals to examine certain such defendants without additional compensation, except expenses payable by counties, providing for the commitment of defendants to certain institutions where the reports show the same to be advisable; and providing for the payment by individuals, counties, or the Commonwealth of the cost of admission, care and discharge of such defendants.\u201d\nIf the inquiry is properly controlled, as it should be, the evil suggested by the learned trial judge as incident to the application of the rule, will not result. The difficulties, in any event, are inherent in the undertaking. Until this court shall hold, or the legislature shall establish, that evidence specifically going to the penalty shall be received only after a special finding of guilt has been returned, the inquiry as to guilt may of course be prejudicially affected by evidence received for the purpose of enabling the jury to fix the penalty. But we must not adopt a rule minimizing the difficulty by excluding relevant evidence favorable to a defendant while allowing evidence of the character indicated to be received against him.\nJudgment affirmed and record remitted for purposes of execution.\n\u201cEvery person convicted of the crime of murder of the first degree shall be sentenced to suffer death in the manner provided by law, or to undergo imprisonment for life, at the discretion of the jury trying the ease, which shall fix the penalty by its verdict.\u201d\nCom. v.
