{"id": "1761000", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nLARSEN, Justice.\nThis is an appeal from an order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County denying appellant\u2019s petition for post-conviction relief. Appellant argues that his trial/direct appeal counsel was ineffective in several respects, namely:\n1. For failure to object to, or motion for a mistrial because of, allegedly prejudicial remarks of the prosecutor during his closing arguments;\n2. For failure to request an instruction to the jury on involuntary manslaughter; and\n3. for failure to call certain witnesses in his behalf.\nWe have examined the record and conclude that these issues are without merit. Accordingly, judgments of sentence affirmed.\nEAGEN, C. J., notes a dissent and would grant a new trial because of prosecutorial misconduct.\nROBERTS, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. Appellant\u2019s judgments of sentence for murder of the third degree and carrying a firearm without a license were upheld by this Court on direct appeal. Commonwealth v. Solomon, 471 Pa. 417, 370 A.2d 372 (1977)."}
