The matter of the right to a bill of review in the Orphans\u2019 Court, has been so fully discussed in recent cases that we can better employ our time than in going over the same ground again: See Jones's App., 99 Pa. 124; Lehr\u2019s App., 98 Pa. 25 ; Le Moyne\u2019s App., 104 Pa. 321; Scott\u2019s App., 112 Pa. 427.\nThe decree is affirmed and the appeal dismissed, at the costs of the appellant."}
