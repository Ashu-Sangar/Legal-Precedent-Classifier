{"id": "1935412", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Eagen,\nRonald Eugene Storck was taken into police custody in Honolulu, Hawaii, and then extradited to Pennsylvania to face criminal charges pending in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.. Police officers were subsequently sent to Honolulu to investigate Storck\u2019s activities during his stay in that area, and while there interviewed \u00e1 Frank Carreira, who at the time was living on a sixty-five foot power boat. Carreira told the officers, that before his arrest Storck had manifested an \u2022intention to purchase the Carreira boat, and before leaving for New York purportedly to obtain the necessary money, had \u201cstored\u201d in a room on the boat a quantity of items, including two suit cases, three' or four boxes and a duffel bag. Two days later, tbe officers returned to the boat without a search warrant and, after telling Carreira that they had \u201ca right to these items\u201d were \u201callowed\u201d by Carreira to take possession of the suit cases, boxes and duffel bag. Later, upon opening these items the police discovered enclosed therein a series of articles which the Commonwealth planned to use against Storck in the prosecution of the criminal charges pending against him in Bucks County, A timely pretrial motion to suppress this evidence was filed, and after a hearing the court below granted the motion. The Commonwealth filed this appeal. We affirm.\nThere is no claim that probable cause existed to warrant a seizure of the suppressed evidence, but the Commonwealth contends that the evidentiary use therer of is constitutionally permissible because the constitutional protection against an unreasonable search and seizure was waived. The burden of proving such a waiver rests upon the asserting party. Bumper v. North Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 88 S. Ct. 1788 (1968).\nThe Commonwealth, first asserts that such a waiver was established through the testimony of Carreira that he gave permission to the police to take possession of the suit cases, boxes and duffel bag. For the purpose of this opinion, it is unnecessary to decide whether this permission was validly obtained or was binding on Storck as far as the containers themselves are concerned. But see, Frazier v. Cupp, 394 U.S. 731, 89 S. Ct. 1420 (1969), and U.S, ex rel. Cabey v. .Mazurkiewicz, 431 F. 2d 839 (3d Cir. 1970). See also, 70 Dick. L. Rev. 510 (1966) and 36 Temple Law Quarterly 95 (1962). What we must decide is, assuming Carreira also gave a valid permission or consent to the police to open these containers and seize the articles enclosed therein, did this bind Storck. We conclude not.\nThe suit cases, boxes and duffel bag were merely \u201cstored\u201d on Carreira\u2019s boat. His possession was for a limited'purpose, and somewhat akin to that of a bank which rents boxes in its safety box vault for the \u201cstorage\u201d of its customers\u2019 valuables. Carreira had no authority to open the containers or to use them for his own purposes such as in Frazier v. Cupp, supra, nor do the facts establish that Storck relinquished or abandoned his ownership or control in and over the articles stored. -Hence, the contention of the Commonwealth that Carreira enjoyed an independent right of his own to consent to the seizure cannot be sustained. Cf. Stoner v. California, 376 U.S. 483, 84 S. Ct. 889 (1964) ; Chapman v. United States, 365 U.S. 610, 81 S. Ct. 776 (1961); Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 80 S. Ct. 725 (1960); United States v. Poole, 307 F. Supp. 1185 (E.D. La. 1969); United States v. Brown, 300 F. Supp. 1285 (D. N.H. 1969); and, People v. Egan, 250 Cal. App. 2d 433, 58 Cal. Reporter 627 (1967).\nHere, Carreira, like the landlord in Chapman, supra, and the hotel clerk in Stoner, supra, could not effectively waive Storck\u2019s constitutional right to be secure in his \u201cpersonal effects,\u201d as secured by the Fourth Amendment.\n' Finally, the Commonwealth contends that a waiver existed, because Storck\u2019s personal attorney in Honolul\u00fa, John Ahrens, Esq., gave Carreira permission by phone to deliver the suit cases, boxes and duffel bag to the police. The lower court found as a fact, based on competent and credible evidence, that this phone conversation did not take place until after Carreira had already given the police possession, and, therefore, the permission given by Ahrens is of little moment in resolving the pivotal issue of Carreira\u2019s right to waive Storck\u2019s constitutional protection.\nAlso, under the circumstances, we need not reach the question of whether or not an attorney may pretrial and without consultation waive a protection given his client by the Constitution.\nOrder affirmed."}
