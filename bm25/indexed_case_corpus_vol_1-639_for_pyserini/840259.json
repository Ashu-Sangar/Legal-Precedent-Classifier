{"id": "840259", "contents": "Opinion by-\nMr. Justice Sterrett,\nIn Erisman v. Directors, etc., 47 Pa. 509, a gift having been made in trust for a feme covert with discretionary power in the trustee to apply any part of the trust estate for the benefit of the cestui que trust, \u201c if urgent necessity shall require,\u201d this court held (1) that the discretion here given was but legal, and whenever the law determined that a proper case had arisen, in which the trustee\u2019s discretion should have been exercised in a particular way, he would be constrained to act in accordance therewith ; and (2) that the adjudication of lunacy of the cestui que trust, and the indigence of her husband fixed the fact of \u201c urgent necessity,\u201d and the consequent liability of the trust estate.\nSubstantially the same provision is made in Mrs. Jackson\u2019s conveyance. She expressly gave her trustee discretionary power to use \u201c so much of the principal \u201d of the trust estate as he \u201c shall deem necessary for \u201d her \u201cbenefit;\u201d and, in harmony therewith, reserved to herself the power of absolute testamentary disposition of the residue. Here is a legal discretion which the court might, on presentation of a proper case, have constrained for the benefit of Mrs. Jackson. That such a case was presented to the orphans\u2019 court, in the proceedings for sale, seems clear. The adjudication that Mrs. Jackson had left unpaid debts implied that these were for necessaries, and the order of sale, that her husband was unable to pay them. This fixed the fact of \u201c necessity \u201d and the consequent liability of the trust estate; else debts could not have existed, nor sale have been made: Act of 1848.\nThe plaintiff has no equity to sustain her claim of title. Her grantor\u2019s mother was the absolute owner of the land when she created the trust; and while, by her conveyance, she divested herself of the legal title and active management, its manifest purpose was to promote her own personal benefit. She expressly reserved (1) the income, (2) the right to call on the principal, in case of necessity, and (3) tho power of absoluto testamentary disposition of the residue. Thus, by the very terms of the conveyance, the whole estate could have been exhausted for her benefit in her lifetime, or bequeathed by her to a stranger. Then why should not the land have been liable for her debts ? 'Flic interest of plaintiff\u2019s grantor was but contingent in his mother\u2019s lifetime; and plaintiff now stands here as a mere volunteer claiming through Mrs. Jackson\u2019s will. She does not deny that the debts, for which the land now claimed by her was sold, were Mrs. Jackson\u2019s; her grantor was a party to the proceeding, which judicially ascertained the existence of these debts, under which sale was made for their payment, and upon the faith of which defendant became the purchaser, paid the price and took possession. As was said iu Griudrod\u2019s Estate, 140 Pa. 161 : \u201cSomething is due to the finality of judgments. The orphans\u2019 court, after such a lapse of time (10 years), has no power, unless, perhaps, in the case of a fraud practiced upon it, to set aside the sale and vacate its own decree. If it might do so after ten years it might do so after a hundred.\u201d Here thirty years have elapsed since the sale made under the order of the orphans\u2019 court, and the record so made remains unimpeached. If it is unimpeachable by direct application to the orphans\u2019 court, much less can it be nullified by collateral attack. The plaintiff\u2019s grantor had his day in the orphans\u2019 court, and his grantee, the plaintiff, is thereby estopped from claiming title as against this defendant.\nThis view renders unnecessary any discussion of the question upon which the argument of counsel mainly turned, whether or not a feme covert can by voluntary conveyance exempt lier separate estate from her debts thereafter created.\nJudgment affirmed."}
