{"id": "927479", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nThe undisputed facts of the killing, the procuring of a deadly weapon, the threats to let the victim\u2019s \u201c blood out on the street \u201d and finally the firing of the pistol at a vital part, furnish all the elements of murder of the first degree, in regard to which this court is charged by the Act of February 15,1870, P. L. 15, to review the evidence. The effect of the evidence was for the jury, not for the court.\nThe onfy defense was insanity and that also was for the jury. The burden of proof was upon the prisoner, and there was no error in so charging. The judge\u2019s language that the jury must be \u201c satisfied that the defendant was insane when he committed the act \u201d tended to call the attention of the jury to the distinction between the degree of proof required of the prisoner on that subject and the requirement of the commonwealth to satisfy the jury of the prisoner\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The expression was in aid of the prisoner\u2019s case and could not have been reasonably understood in any other sense.\nJudgment affirmed and record remitted to the court below for execution according to law."}
