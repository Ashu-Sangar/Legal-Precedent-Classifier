It cannot be pretended that in this case Mrs. Cupps\u2019s money was paid out in conformity to any one of these by-laws. It was paid out on forged orders, and these orders were \u201cnot properly witnessed,\u201d as the by-laws required the orders of absent depositors to be. It was not a question of negligence, and contributory negligence in the depositor was of. no consequence. It was a case of mis-payment, contrary to the published rules, and the defendants below have no right to complain of the ruling of the learned judge below.\nJudgment affirmed."}
