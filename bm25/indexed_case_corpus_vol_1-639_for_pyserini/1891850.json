{"id": "1891850", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Roberts,\nI\nAt issue in this litigation is the constitutional validity, under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution of the present apportionment of seats in both houses of the Pennsylvania Legislature.\nOn March 30, 1962, plaintiffs, Pennsylvania taxpayers and electors, filed complaints in equity in the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County against the Secretary of the Commonwealth. The complaints sought that defendant be restrained from taking any steps toward the holding of elections for state legislative offices under the provisions of the existing apportionment acts on the ground that the acts violated certain provisions of the Pennsylvania and Federal Constitutions. After an answer was filed by defendant, plaintiffs moved for judgment on the pleadings. The motion was denied on June 13, 1962. However, the court of common pleas retained jurisdiction of the action, held the issues concerning reapportionment to be justiciable, and refused to adjudicate them until the Legislature had an opportunity to enact appropriate legislation at its forthcoming sessions. On November 12, 1963, a special session of the General Assembly was convened for the purpose of considering reapportionment legislation. Subsequently, two reapportionment bills, the Act of January 9, 1964, No. 1, P. L. (1963) 1419, 25 P.S. \u00a72221 (Supp. 1963), and the Act of January 9, 1964, No. 2, P. L. (1963) 1432, 25 P.S. \u00a72217 (Supp. 1963), were passed and approved by the Governor.\nOn January 14, 1964, plaintiffs petitioned the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to take immediate jurisdiction of this case, and on January 15 we granted plaintiffs\u2019 petition and issued a Special Writ of Certiorari to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County. We also permitted intervention by two residents of Bucks County who filed a separate complaint averring, inter alia, that the First Legislative District of Bucks County is not compact within the meaning of Article II, \u00a717, of the Pennsylvania Constitution and that they are denied fair and equal representation as required by \u00a71 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. On January 24, 1964, we remanded the matter to the Dauphin County court with directions to hold a hearing forthwith, to allow any pertinent amendment and any proper intervention, to make all necessary and appropriate findings of fact, and to remit its findings and report to this Court as expeditiously as possible. On March 19, 1964, after several hearings in that court, the hearing judge filed a report and findings of fact. On April 7, 1964, oral argument was held before this Court.\nII\nIn considering this case, we are aware that a similar proceeding was instituted in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on November 22, 1963. On April 9, 1964, that three-judge court filed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an opinion holding the Pennsylvania Reapportionment Acts of January 9, 1964, and certain provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution to be violative of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. Accordingly, it enjoined various state officials from conducting elections pursuant thereto. That court retained jurisdiction of the matter pending enactment of a valid reapportionment plan by the General Assembly or, in default thereof, by its own decree or in some other lawful manner. At the same time, it announced that it would reconvene in Philadelphia on June 1, 1964, to consider any further relief which might be necessary. On April 14, 1964, a stay of the federal district court order was granted pending appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States.\nIll\nFor many reasons, we believe that we should decide the issues presented and provide necessary remedies for achieving valid reapportionment. In the presence of the demonstrated willingness of the Legislature to act and the willingness of our courts to assume jurisdiction, the federal district court should be relieved of responsibility in this matter for a period sufficient to allow such remedies to become effective. In assuming the responsibility of securing, in a timely fashion, a reapportionment plan which would meet the requirements of the Federal and State Constitutions, we have taken literally the words of the Supreme Court of the United States: \u201cWe applaud the willingness of state courts to assume jurisdiction and render decision in cases involving challenges to state legislative apportionment schemes.\" Maryland Committee for Fair Representation v. Tawes, 377 U.S. 656, 674, 84 S. Ct. 1442, 1451-52 (1964). (Emphasis supplied.)\nThis suit challenges the recent Pennsylvania Reapportionment Acts and the election of state senators and representatives thereunder. More importantly, it challenges \u2014 in light of recent decisions interpreting the Constitution of the United States \u2014 the validity of certain provisions of the Constitution of Pennsylvania which establish the legislative branch of government. It presents one of the most important constitutional questions ever raised in the history of this Commonwealth. It involves the basic rights of the citizens of Pennsylvania in the election of their state lawmakers. Historically and logically, this Court is the most appropriate forum to determine the issues presented and to fashion suitable remedies. Proper and continuing respect for federal-state judicial relationship necessitates consideration by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania of the relevant state statutes and state constitutional provisions, subject, of course, to review by the Supreme Court of the United States.\nFurthermore, jurisdiction with respect to the matters involved was obtained by the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin County prior to the federal district court, and both the former court and this Court have acted diligently in light of all the circumstances of this case. After the initial complaints were filed in March, 1962, the common pleas court postponed adjudication of the issues involved in order to give the Legislature an opportunity to act at its forthcoming session. At a special session in 1963, the General Assembly enacted reapportionment legislation, and, immediately thereafter, this Court assumed jurisdiction of this case, received findings of fact and a report based on hearing before the Dauphin County court, and promptly heard argument. Meanwhile, the federal district court denied an application for a preliminary injunction which would have restrained state officials from conducting any election for state legislative office, pending final enactment by the General Assembly of reapportionment legislation then being considered. Therefore, both the federal court and the state courts postponed judicial action while awaiting the final passage of the Pennsylvania Reapportionment Acts; both acted promptly in their respective cases in the spring of 1964. Further immediate action by us was made unnecessary by the stay of the federal order, granted April 14, 1964, pending appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. Thus, we were given the opportunity to await opinions of that Court in related cases concerning reapportionment in other states before rendering a decision in the instant case.\nIt is obvious, of course, that the federal district court\u2019s decision of April 9, 1964, was made without the benefit of this Court\u2019s interpretation of relevant Pennsylvania constitutional provisions, and, more importantly, without the benefit of recent crucial and controlling decisions announced by the Supreme Court of the\u2019 United States on June 15, 1964. We believe, for reasons which will appear later in our opinion, that reliance on all that was said and directed in the opinion of the district court, although excellent in many respects, would be constitutionally unsafe.\nThe General Assembly of Pennsylvania is entitled to an opportunity to enact reapportionment legislation pursuant to the recent Reynolds cases and to our interpretation here of pertinent provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Since the Legislature is intimately acquainted with the characteristics of Pennsylvania and is primarily responsible for constitutional apportionment, action by that, body, taken promptly and in good faith, is more likely to achieve a workable, constitutionally acceptable result than an apportionment following the suggested plan of the district court.\nIY\nThe Supreme Court of the United States has held that \u201cseats in both houses of a bicameral state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis\u201d; that \u201can indiyidual\u2019s right to vote for state legislators is unconstitutionally impaired when its weight is in a substantial fashion diluted when compared with votes of citizens living in other parts of the State\u201d; that \u201cDiluting the weight of votes because of place of residence impairs basic constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment just as much as invidious discriminations based upon factors such as race ... or economic status\u201d; and that state legislative districting schemes which give the same number of representatives to unequal numbers of constituents would not be constitutionally sustainable.\nThe Act of January 9, 1964, No. 1, which fixes the number of representatives at 209 divides the state into districts as follows:\n(Population ratio based on division by 200: 56,597)\nNo. Population\nDistrict District of Repreper Repre-\nCounty No. Total sentatives sentative\nPhiladelphia 1 57,507 1 57,507\n2 123,445 2 61,722\n3 50,896 1 50,896\n4 52,246 1 52,246\n5 118,067 2 59,033\n6 59,203 1 59,203\n7 105,037 2 52,519\n8 66,017 1 66,017\n9 68,833 1 68,833\n10 53,550 1 53,550\n11 59,483 1 59,483\n12 166,944 3 55,648\n13 54,497 1 54,497\n14 50,616 1 50,616\n15 53,563 1 53,563\n16 51,055 1 51,055\n17 98,589 2 49,299\n18 65,622 1 65,622\n19 64,956 1 64,956\n20 53,986 1 53,986\n21 114,280 2 57,140\n22 42,761 1 42,761\n23 64,982 1 64,982\n24 48,898 1 48,898\n25 137,260 2 68,630\n26 120,210 2 60,105\nAdams 51,906 1 51,906\nAllegheny 1 137,544 2 68,772\n2 50,690 1 50,690\n3 49,644 1 49,644\n4 49,413 1 49,413\n5 47,301 1 47,301\n6 132,115 2 66,058\n7 143,605 2 71,802\n8 53,515 1 53,515\n9 111,365 2 55,682\nNo. Population\nDistrict of RepreDistrict per Repre-\nCounty Total sentatives No. sentative\nAllegheny (Cont\u2019d)\n10 63,944 1 63,944\n11 127,373 2 63,687\n12 62,839 1 62,839\n13 60,727 1 60,727\n14 235,672 4 58,918\n15 153,108 3 51,036\n16 150,966 3 50,322\nArmstrong 79,524 1 79,524\nBeaver 1 102,521 2 51,260\n2 104,427 2 52,213\nBedford 42,451 1 42,451\nBerks 1 48,551 1 48,551 '\n2 59,639 1 59,639\n3 56,817 1 56,817\n4 60,781 1 60,781\n5 49,626 1 49,626\nBlair 1 69,407 1 69.407\n2 67,863 1 67,863\nBradford 54,925 1 54,925\nBucks 1 236,905 4 59,226\n2 71,662 1 71,662\nButler .1 58,819 1 58.819\n2 55,820 1 55.820\nCambria 1 56,756 1 56,756\n2 95,114 2 47,557\n3 51,413 1 51,413\nCameron 7,586 1 \u25a0 7,586\nCarbon 52,889 1 52,889\nCentre 78,580 1 \u25a0 78,580\nChester 1 105,824 2 52,912\n2 104,784 2 52,392\nClarion 37,408 1 37.408\nClearfield 81,534 1 81,534\nClinton 37,619 1 37,619\nColumbia 53,489 1 53,489\nOpinion of the Court.

We realize, as does the Supreme Court of the United States, \u201cthat it is a practical impossibility to arrange legislative districts so that each one has an identical number of residents, or citizens, or voters,\u201d and that \u201cmathematical exactness or precision is hardly a workable constitutional requirement.\u201d But the present districting scheme does not meet that requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment which \u201cdemands no less than substantially equal state legislative representation for all citizens, of all places . . . .\u201d\nSeveral vivid examples, by no means exhaustive, illustrate the gross disparities which exist under the Act. Twelve counties, namely Clearfield, with a population of 81,534; Armstrong, with a population of 79,-524; Centre, with a population of 78,580; Crawford, with a population of 77,958; Somerset, with a population of 77,450; Indiana, with a population of 75,366; Venango, with a population of 65,295; Bradford, with a population of 54,925; McKean, with a population of 54,517; Columbia, with a population of 53,489; Carbon, with a population of 52,889; and Adams, with a population of 51,906, are assigned only one representative each. Twelve other counties, namely, Forest, with a population of 4,485; Sullivan, with a population of 6,251; Cameron, with a population of 7,586; Pike, with a population of 9,158; Fulton, with a population of 10,597; Juniata, with a population of 15,874; Potter, with a population of 16,483; Montour, with a population of 16,730; Wyoming, with a population of 16,813; Snyder, with a population of 25,922; Union, with a population of 25,646; and Perry, with a population of 26,582, are also assigned one representative each. Furthermore, thirteen other counties, ranging in populations from a low of 28,237, to a high of 46,792, are also assigned one representative each. These examples show, by cursory analysis, the existence of at least thirty-seven districts which differ widely in population but are equal in representation.\nIn examining the districts established by the Act, it is apparent that many population disparities resulted from an allocation by the Legislature of at least one representative to each county in the state regardless of the population of that county. This allocation resulted from the assumption that the heretofore unquestioned pattern of one representative per county was mandated by the Pennsylvania Constitution, Article II, \u00a717. Although the Supreme Court of the United States has recognized that \u201ca consideration that appears to be of more substance in justifying some deviations from population-based representation in state legislatures is that of insuring some voice to political subdivisions . . .,\u201d that Court has made it clear that \u201cpermitting deviations from population-based representation does not mean that each local governmental unit or political subdivision can be given separate representation, regardless of population.\u201d The Supreme Court of the United States has stated: \u201cCarried too far, a scheme of giving at least one seat in one house to each political subdivision (for example, to each county) could easily result, in many States, in a total subversion of the equal-population principle in that legislative body. This would be especially true in a State where the number of counties is large and many of them are sparsely populated, and the number of seats in the legislative body being apportioned does not significantly exceed the number of counties.... [I] f, even as a result of a clearly rational state policy of according some legislative representation to political subdivisions, population is submerged as the controlling consideration in the apportionment of seats in the particular legislative body, then the right of all of the State\u2019s citizens to cast an effective and adequately weighted vote would be unconstitutionally impaired.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 581, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 1391-92 (1964).\nCareful consideration of the legislative districting scheme embodied in the Pennsylvania Reapportionment Act, No. 1, as well as the populations of all of Pennsylvania\u2019s counties, compels us to rule that assignment of one seat to each county, regardless of population, results in the submergence of population as the controlling consideration in apportionment and is offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. It must therefore be concluded that the Act of January 9, 1964, No. 1 (which provides for reapportionment of the House of Representatives), by substantially diluting the right to vote of individuals in some districts when compared with the rights of voters in other districts, is' constitutionally insufficient.\nV\nAs we have indicated, the Supreme Court of the United States has held that reapportionment of both houses in a bicameral legislature must be based on population. The Act of January 9, 1964, No. 2, apportions the State Senate into senatorial districts, as follows:\n(Population ratio per Senator : 226,387)\nDistrict 1960 No. of\nNo. County Population Senators\n1 Philadelphia (part) 260,767 1\n2 Philadelphia (part) 255,869 1\n3 Philadelphia (part) 251,415 \u2022 1\n4 Philadelphia (part) 241,032 1\n5 Philadelphia (part) 236;148 1\n6 Philadelphia (part) 242,667 1\n7 Philadelphia (part.) 266,242 1\n8 Philadelphia (part) 248,372 1\n37 Allegheny (part) 236,359 1\n38 Allegheny (part) 233,003 1\n40 Allegheny (part) 241,633 1\n42 Allegheny (part) 226,269 1\n43 Allegheny (part) 237,367 1\n44 Allegheny (part) 233,086 1\n45 Allegheny (part) 222,104 1\n9 Delaware (part) 255.888 1\n26 Delaware (part) 297,266 1\n12 Montgomery (part) 262,794 1\n17 Montgomery (part) 253.888 1\n39 Westmoreland 352,629 1\n20 Luzerne 346,972 1\n10 Bucks 308,567 1\nDistrict 1960 No. of\nNo. County Population Senators\n13 Lancaster 278,359 1\n11 Berks 275,414 1\n29 Schuylkill, Lebanon 263,880 1\n49 Erie 250.682 1\n28 York 238,336 1\n22 Lackawanna 234,531 1\n21 Butler, Lawrence 227,604 1\n16 Lehigh 227,536 1\n15 Dauphin 220,255 1\n46 Washington 217,271 1\n31 Mifflin, Juniata, Perry, Cumberland 211,620 1\n19 Chester 210;608 1\n32 Fayette, Greene 208,764 1\n47 Beaver 206,948 1\n50 Mercer, Crawford 205,475 1\n35 Cambria 203,283 1\n41 Jefferson, Armstrong, Indiana 201.682 1\n18 Northampton 201,412 1\n24 Columbia, Lycoming, Montour 179,586 1\n30 Blair, Huntingdon 176,727 1\n25 Potter, McKean, Warren,\nClinton, Cameron 161,787 1\n34 Centre, Clearfield 160,114 1\n27 Northumberland, Snyder, Union 155,706 1\n23 Bradford, Susquehanna, Tioga, Wyoming, Sullivan 147,740 1\n48 Elk, Forest, Clarion, Venango 144,516 1\n33 Franklin, Adams 140,078 1\n36 Bedford, Fulton, Somerset 130,498 1\n14 Carbon, Monroe, Pike, Wayne 129,851 1\nExamination of the foregoing senatorial districts shows that, in many instances, they contain widely varying numbers of people. Some examples of gross disparities in population can be cited. The tenth district consisting of Bucks, with a population of 308,-567; the twentieth district consisting of Luzerne, with a population of 346,972; the thirty-ninth district consisting of Westmoreland, with a population of 352,629, are each represented by one senator. The fourteenth district consisting of Carbon, Monroe, Pike, and Wayne, with a population of 129,851; the thirty-sixth district consisting of Bedford, Eulton, and Somerset, with a population of 130,498; the thirty-third district consisting of Franklin and Adams, with a population of 140,078; the forty-eighth district consisting of Elk, Forest, Clarion, and Venango, with a population of 144,516; the twenty-third district consisting of Bradford, Susquehanna, Tioga, Wyoming, and Sullivan, with a population of 147,740, are each represented by one senator. In the examples just cited, senators from the tenth, twentieth, and thirty-ninth districts each represent more than two times as many people as do senators from each of the other districts.\nIn Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 562, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 1382 (1964), the Supreme Court of the United States said: \u201cif a State should provide that the votes of citizens in one part of the State should be given two times, or five times, or 10 times the weight of votes of citizens in another part of the State, it could hardly be contended that the right to vote ... in the disfavored areas had not been effectively diluted.\u201d\nCareful consideration of the entire legislative districting scheme for the Pennsylvania Senate, including not only the districts which we have cited above, but other districts as well, requires us to conclude that the Act of January 9, 1964, No. 2, which provides for reapportionment of the Senate by substantially diluting the right to vote of individuals in some districts when compared with, the rights of voters in other districts, fails to meet the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\nVI\nIn light of our conclusion that the Acts of January 9, 1964, Nos. 1 and 2, are constitutionally insufficient, we have given much consideration to the remedy which should be granted. Recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States make it clear that it is for us to determine \u201cwhether the imminence of the 1964 . . . general elections requires the utilization of the apportionment scheme contained\u201d in those acts notwithstanding their invalidity, as the following excerpts indicate:\n\u201cSince primary responsibility for legislative apportionment rests with the legislature itself, and since adequate time exists in which the Maryland General Assembly can act, the Maryland courts need feel obliged to take further affirmative action only if the legislature fails to enact a constitutionally valid state legislative apportionment scheme in a timely fashion after being afforded a further opportunity by the courts to do so. However, under no circumstances should the 1966 election of members of the Maryland Legislature be permitted to be conducted pursuant to the existing or any other unconstitutional plan. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals, and remand the case to that Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views stated here and in our opinion in Reynolds v. Sims.\u201d Maryland Committee for Fair Representation v. Tawes, 377 U.S. 656, 676, 84 S. Ct. 1442, 1452-53 (1964). (Emphasis supplied.)\n\u201cSince all members of both houses of the New York Legislature will be elected in November 1964, the court below, acting under equitable principles, must now determine whether, because of the imminence of that election and in order to give the New York Legislature an opportunity to fashion a constitutionally valid legislative apportionment plan, it would be desirable to permit the 1964 election of legislators to be conducted pursuant to the existing provisions, or whether under the circumstances the effectuation of appellants\u2019 right to a properly weighted voice in the election of state legislators should not be delayed beyond the 1964 election.\u201d WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, 377 U.S. 633, 655, 84 S. Ct. 1418, 1429 (1964).\n\u201cSince the apportionment of seats in the Colorado Legislature . . . fails to comport with the requirements of the Equal Protection Clause, the decision below must be reversed. Beyond what we said in our opinion in Reynolds, we express no view on questions relating to remedies at the present time. On remand, the District Court must now determine whether the imminence of the 1964 primary and general elections requires that utilization of the apportionment scheme contained in the constitutional amendment be permitted, for purposes of those elections, or whether the circumstances in Colorado are such that appellants\u2019 right to cast adequately weighted votes for members of the State Legislature can practicably be effectuated in 1964.\u201d Lucas v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly of Colorado, 377 U.S. 713, 739, 84 S. Ct. 1472, 1487-88 (1964).\nIt is obvious that the Pennsylvania Legislature cannot properly act to reapportion itself in the short time remaining before the election of November 3, 1964, and months after the April 28, 1964 primary election. We do believe, however, that the Legislature made an earnest effort to reapportion itself in 1963. Unfortunately, it was then without the benefit of the views of the Supreme Court of the United States expressed in the Reynolds cases and without an interpretation by this Court of important and relevant provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution. Serious disruption of orderly state election processes and basic governmental functions would result from immediate action by any judicial tribunal restraining or interfering with the normal operation of the election machinery at this late date. The Legislature should not be denied a reasonable opportunity to enact new reapportionment legislation. We therefore hold that the 1964 election of Pennsylvania legislators should and must be conducted pursuant to the Acts of January 9, 1964, Nos. 1 and 2. Under no circumstances, however, may the 1966 election of members of tbe Pennsylvania Legislature be conducted pursuant to a constitutionally invalid plan.\nTbe task of reapportionment is not only tbe responsibility of tbe Legislature, it is also a function wbicb can be best accomplished by that elected branch of government. Tbe composition of tbe Legislature, tbe knowledge wbicb its members from every part of tbe state bring to its deliberations, its techniques for gathering information, and other factors inherent in tbe legislative process, make it tbe most appropriate body for tbe drawing of lines dividing tbe state into senatorial and representative districts. We expect, therefore, that tbe General Assembly will enact reapportionment legislation in accordance with constitutional requirements.\nVII\nIn order to prevent undue confusion on tbe part of those who are assigned tbe primary task of reapportionment, we feel compelled to discuss several provisions of tbe Constitution of Pennsylvania as well as to comment upon certain aspects of the opinion filed by the district court.\nArticle II, \u00a716, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which relates to senatorial districts, provides: \u201cThe State shall be divided into fifty senatorial districts of compact and contiguous territory as nearly equal in population as may be, and each district shall be entitled to elect one Senator. Each county containing one or more ratios of population shall be entitled to one Senator for each ratio, and to an additional Senator for a surplus population exceeding three-fifths of a ratio, but no county shall form a separate district unless it shall contain four-fifths of a ratio, except where the adjoining counties are each entitled to one or more Senators, when such county may be assigned a Senator on less than four-fifths and exceeding one-half of a ratio; and no county shall be divided unless entitled to two or more Senators. No city or county shall be entitled to separate representation exceeding one-sixth of the whole number of Senators. No ward, borough, or township shall be divided in the formation of a district. The senatorial ratio shall be ascertained by dividing the whole population of the State by the number fifty.\u201d\nThe first sentence of \u00a716 embraces fully the population principle expressed by the Supreme Court of the United States in the Reynolds cases. The Constitution\u2019s intention to make population the starting point and controlling criterion in senatorial districting is manifest and mandatory. It acknowledges what the Supreme Court of the United States has also acknowledged, \u201cthat it is a practical impossibility to arrange legislative districts so that each one has an identical number of residents, or citizens, or voters,\u201d by providing that the senatorial districts \u201cshould be as nearly equal in population as may be.\u201d But this phrase cannot and must not be construed to permit substantial dilution of the right to vote. It is our view that \u00a716, when construed as a whole, demands that Senate apportionment legislation respect county lines and lines of other political subdivisions (such as wards, boroughs, and townships), insofar as possible, without doing violence to the population principle enunciated by the first sentence of \u00a716 and also by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. The Supreme Court of the United States has said: \u201cA State may legitimately desire to maintain the integrity of various political subdivisions, insofar as possible, and provide for compact districts of contiguous territory in designing a legislative apportionment scheme. Valid considerations may underlie such aims. Indiscriminate districting, without any regard for political subdivision or natural or historical boundary lines, may be little more than an open invitation to partisan gerrymandering. . . . Whatever the means of accomplishment, the overriding objective must be substantial equality of population among the various districts, so that the vote of any citizen is approximately equal in weight to that of any other citizen in the State.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 579, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 1390 (1964).\nWe hold, therefore, that Article II, \u00a716 of the Pennsylvania Constitution requires that senatorial reapportionment legislation must maintain the integrity of counties and other political subdivisions, insofar as possible, and must provide for compact districts of contiguous territory, subject always to the overriding objective and mandate that such districts shall be \u201cas nearly equal in population as may be.\u201d We must emphasize that, if necessary, any political subdivision or subdivisions may be divided or combined in the formation of districts where the population principle cannot otherwise be satisfied. Furthermore, the number of senators per political subdivision may not be limited if such limitation violates the equal-population principle.\nArticle II, \u00a717, of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which relates to the House of Representatives, provides: \u201cThe members of the House of Representatives shall be apportioned among the several counties, on a ratio obtained by dividing the population of the State as ascertained by the most recent United States census by two hundred. Every county containing less than five ratios shall have one representative for every full ratio, and an additional representative when the surplus exceeds half a ratio; but each county shall have at least one representative. Every county containing five ratios or more shall have one representative for every full ratio. Every city containing a population equal to a ratio shall elect separately its proportion of the representatives allotted to the county in which it is located. Every city entitled to more than four representatives, and every county having over one hundred thousand inhabitants shall be divided into districts of compact and contiguous territory, each district to elect its proportion of representatives according to its population, but no district shall elect more than four representatives.\u201d\nIt is clear that the first sentence of \u00a717 is in accord with the requirements of the federal constitution. It expressly recognizes the equal-population principle as the controlling factor in apportioning the House of Representatives. Division of the population of the state by two hundred, supplies \u201ca ratio\u201d and a starting point in the construction of districts. In contrast to \u00a716 which provides for a fixed number, i.e., \u201cfifty senatorial districts\u201d with each district \u201centitled to elect one Senator,\u201d nothing in \u00a717 precludes the establishment of a House of Representatives consisting of more than two hundred members, provided, of course, the equal-population rule is observed.\nThe requirement that apportionment should be among the several counties further signifies an intention to respect county lines and to utilize counties as units of representation to the maximum extent consistent with the equal-population principle. Indeed, \u00a717, when considered as a whole, demands that the boundaries of all political subdivisions be respected when not in conflict with the overriding population principle. It must be interpreted to require that counties with small populations, if necessary, be joined with other counties for the purpose of electing and sharing a representative. We hold that no provision of \u00a717 prohibits the division or combination of counties in the formation of districts where the population principle cannot otherwise be satisfied.\nVIII\nAlthough the opinion of the district court sought to anticipate some of the requirements laid down by recent decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, we feel that it differs in some material respects from the views contained in those controlling decisions. Throughout the district court\u2019s opinion runs the theme that if there is equality of representation as between rural groups of counties on the one hand and urban groups of counties on the other, then Pennsylvania will be apportioned constitutionally. With this theme we cannot agree. Unconstitutional discrimination may exist irrespective of the rural or urban character of the underrepresented or overrepresented district. Those whose task it is to reapportion the Pennsylvania Legislature must approach their assignment with the understanding that they are to create districts which are as nearly equal in population as is practicable.\n\u201cBy holding that as a federal constitutional requisite both houses of a state legislature must be apportioned on a population basis, we mean that the Equal Protection Clause requires that a State make an honest and good faith effort to construct districts, in both houses of its legislature, as nearly of equal population as is practicable.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 577, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 1389-90 (1964).\nFurthermore, the district court announced that it would not invalidate unequal representation resulting from use of the county as a district, provided that the disparity from the norm does not exceed one-half of a ratio. In our view, the establishment of a rigid mathematical standard is inappropriate in evaluating the constitutional validity of a state legislative apportionment scheme. In Roman v. Sincock, 377 U.S. 695, 710 n.21, 84 S. Ct. 1462, 1470 n.21 (1964), the Supreme Court pointed out that the lower court in that case had suggested that population-based variance ratios smaller than iy2 to 1 would presumably comport with minimal constitutional requisites, while ratios in excess thereof would necessarily involve deviations from population-based apportionment too extreme to be constitutionally sustainable. The Court said: \u201cOur affirmance of the decision below is not meant to indicate approval of the District Court\u2019s attempt to state in mathematical language the constitutionally permissible bounds of discretion in deviating from apportionment according to population. In our view the problem does not lend itself to any such uniform formula, and it is neither practicable nor desirable to establish rigid mathematical standards for evaluating the constitutional validity of a state legislative apportionment scheme under the Equal Protection Clause. Rather, the proper judicial approach is to ascertain whether, under the particular circumstances existing in the individual State whose legislative apportionment is at issue, there has been a faithful adherence to a plan of population-based representation, with such minor deviations only as may occur in recognizing certain factors that are free from any taint of arbitrariness or discrimination.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)\nFinally, the opinion of the district court declared that there is a discrimination in voting power when voters may, by reason of the arrangement of legislative districts, vote for two, or three, or even four representatives, while others are restricted to voting for one only. Language which appears in the opinion of Chief Justice Warren in Reynolds, and other cases, indicates that the presence of some multi-member districts in one legislative house is not per se unconstitutional: \u201cOne body could be composed of single-member districts while the other could have at least some multimember districts.\u201d Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 577, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 1389 (1964).\n\u201cSingle-member districts may be the rule in one State, while another State might desire to achieve some flexibility by creating multimember or floterial districts.\u201d Id. at 579, 84 S. Ct. at 1390.\n\u201cWe do not intimate that apportionment schemes which provide for the at-large election of a number of legislators from a county, or any political subdivision, are constitutionally defective.\u201d Lucas v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly of Colorado, 377 U.S. 713, 731 n.21, 84 S. Ct. 1472, 1483 n.21 (1964).\nWhile we do not believe that the creation of multimember districts of itself, would violate the Federal Constitution simply because the voters in a particular district (where justified by population) would vote for two or more representatives while those in another district would vote for a lesser number, we do believe that a legislative scheme which creates single-member districts and multi-member districts in an arbitrary manner would be objectionable. We would agree with the district court, however, that in the absence of any reasonable justification (historical or otherwise), such districting might be the result of gerrymandering for partisan advantage and, in that event, would be arbitrary and capricious. In light of the constitutional pitfalls inherent in such a districting scheme, it would be more prudent to approach the matter of apportionment by setting up single-member districts unless valid and compelling reasons exist which require the creation of some multi-member districts.\nOur interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Pennsylvania Constitution makes mandatory only such requirements as are in harmony with the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. We hope the difficult and complex task of the Legislature will be clarified by the guidelines set out in this opinion as well as by the Reynolds cases.\nWe have indicated that it is our expectation that the Legislature will proceed in timely fashion to enact reapportionment laws which conform to constitutional requirements. We must recognize, however, that if the General Assembly fails to act in a timely fashion, we shall be obliged to take necessary affirmative action to insure that the 1966 election of Pennsylvania legislators will be conducted pursuant to a constitutionally valid plan. Proper regard for our responsibility compels us to retain jurisdiction of this matter pending legislative action.\nShould the Legislature fail to enact a constitutionally valid plan of reapportionment as soon as practical, but not later than September 1, 1965, we shall take such action as may be appropriate in light of the then existing situation.\nJurisdiction retained in accordance with this opinion.\nAct of May 10, 1921, P. L. 449, as amended, 25 P.S. \u00a72201 (pertaining to the apportionment of Senate districts) ; Act of July 29, 1953, P. L. 956, 25 P.S. \u00a72215 (pertaining to the apportionment of House districts).\nThe complaint in this action was amended on December 13, 1963, to include an attack on Sections 16 and 17 of Article II of the Pennsylvania Constitution as well as upon proposed senatorial and representative reapportionment bills pending in the Legislature. On February 4, 1964, plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint which clarified the issues raised.\nButcher v. Trimarchi, 28 Pa. D. & C. 2d 537 (C.P. Dauphin Co. 1962).\nAct No. 1 provides for apportionment of the House, Act No. 2-of the Senate.\nDrew v. Scranton, 229 F. Supp. 310 (M.D. Pa. 1964), appeal docketed, 33 U.S.L. Week 3047 (U.S. June 19, 1964) (No. 201).\nSee note 7, infra.\nThis ease must be contrasted with Lucas v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly of Colorado, 377 U.S. 713, 716 n.3, 84 S. Ct. 1472, 1476 n.3 (1964), where the Supreme Court of the United States quoted, with approval, the position of the federal district court, which refused to abstain: \u201c \u2018The considerations which demand abstinence are not present in the instant case. Here, the General Assembly of the State of Colorado has repeatedly refused to perform the mandate imposed by the Colorado Constitution to apportion the legislature. The likelihood that the unapportioned General Assembly will ever apportion itself now appears remote. The Supreme Court of Colorado, while retaining jurisdiction of the subject matter of the controversy presented to it, has postponed further consideration of the cause until June, 1963, Under these circumstances, we must conclude that the parties do not, at least at present, have an adequate, speedy and complete remedy apart from that asserted in the case at har and thus grounds for abstention are at this time lacking.\u2019 \u201d\nAs already indicated, this Court heard arguments on April 7, 1964. The federal district court filed its findings, opinion and order two days later.\nReynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 84 S. Ct. 1362 (1964); WMCA, Inc. v. Lomenzo, 377 U.S. 633, 84 S. Ct. 1418 (1964); Maryland Committee for Fair Representation v. Tawes, 377 U.S. 656, 84 S. Ct. 1442 (1964); Davis v. Mann, 377 U.S. 678, 84 S. Ct. 1453 (1964); Roman v. Sincock, 377 U.S. 695, 84 S. Ct. 1462 (1964); Lucas v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly of Colorado, 377 U.S. 712, 84 S. Ct. 1472 (1964). These eases shall hereinafter be referred to as the \u201cReynolds eases.\u201d The cases deal\" with the following states, respectively, Alabama, New York, Maryland, Virginia, Delaware and Colorado.\nReynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 568, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 1385 (1964).\nIbid.\nId. at 566, 84 S. Ct. at 1384.\nId. at 563, 84 S. Ct. at 1382.\nid. at 577, 84 S. Ct. at 1390.\nId. at 568, 84 S.

Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 580, 581, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 1391 (1964).\nIbid.\nThese acts represent considerable improvement over previous legislation. The hearing judge, in his findings of fact, said: \u201cThe last apportionment of the Senate prior to the 1963 Apportionment Act aforesaid was under the Act of May 10, 1921, P. L. 449, as amended by Act of April 26, 1923, P. L. 106 (25 P.S. 2201). Under said 1921-1923 Acts, Philadelphia was divided into eight senatorial districts, which under 1921 [sic] population statistics ranged in percentage of district population to total Philadelphia population from a low of 7.1% (3rd. district) to a high of 15.6% (8th district). This imbalance of district percentages to total Philadelphia population figures became successively more marked with each decennial census. Under 1960 census figures, the range is from a low of 2.5% (3rd district) to a high of 26.1% (8th district).\u201d\nUnder the 1964 Act, this imbalance of district percentages in Philadelphia has been largely corrected. (The ratio per senator is 226,387 \u2014 11,319,366 divided by 50.) For example, the third district with one senator now has a population of 251,415, while the eighth district has a population of 248,372. Several other examples of districts in which imbalances were corrected are: District No. 38, which had a population of 134,345 per senator, now has a population of 233,003 per senator; District No. 40, which had a population of 328,712, now has a population of 241,633 per senator; District No. 42, which had a population of 109,140, now has a population of 226,269 per senator; District No. 43, which had a population of 157,955, now has a population of 237,367 per senator; District No. 44, which had a population of 338,549, now has a population of 233,086; District No. 45, which had a population of- 509,886, now has a population of 222,104.\nIn the House of Kepresentatives, where the ratio per representative is 54,150 (11,319,366 divided among 209' members) or 56,597 (if the population is divided by 200), many population disparities were lessened. Several examples can be cited: District No. 2 in Allegheny County, which had a population of 29,883 per representative, now has a population of 50,690 per representative; District No. 3 in Allegheny County, which had a population of 38,804, now has a population of 49,644 per representative; District No. 15 in Allegheny County, which had a population of 75,506, now has a population of 51,036 per representative; District No. 16 in Allegheny County, which had a population of 74,465, now has a population of 50,322 per representative; Beaver County District No. 1, which had a population of 76,152, now has a population of 51,261; District No. 2 in Bucks County, which had a population of 139,293, now has a population of 71,662; District No. 26 in Philadelphia County, which had a population of 36,459, now has a population of 60,105; District No. 1 in Chester County, which had a population of 49,034, now has a population of 52,912; while District No. 2 in Chester County, which had a population of 80,787, now has a population of 52,392; and District No. 3 in Delaware County, which had a population of 90,026, now has a population of 58,485.\nReynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 577, 84 S. Ct. 1362, 1390 (1964).\nThis, of course, is not so, since inequalities may exist between urban or rural districts themselves.\nSince a new scheme of legislative districting for the entire state, including Bucks County, must be devised in accordance with the principles we have outlined, it is unnecessary for us to reach the specific issues raised by the intervenors."}
