{"id": "457560", "contents": "The opinion of the court was filed\nPer Curiam.\nThere is no error in this decree. The revocation contained in the second codicil to the testatrix\u2019s will is self supporting. It is wholly independent of the devise following. The entire separation of the two testamentary acts is expressed in the clearest language. In saying as she does, \u201c I hereby unqualifiedly revoke \u201d the bequest previously made, she thereby wholly disconnects the revocation with all and every other bequest which she has made or may make.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
