{"id": "1057701", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nDecember 28, 1916, about 3:45 p. m., Lottie Brown was going along the east sidewalk of South Forty-seventh street, Philadelphia; when in front of No. 1429, she stepped into a pool of water three quarters of a yard long, one-half yard wide and six or seven inches deep ; she was thrown to the ground and sustained injuries. Both plaintiff and her husband sued the City of Philadelphia in trespass, alleging negligence and there are two appeals from the refusal of the court below to remove judgment\u2019s of nonsuit.\nPlaintiff testified she was looking ahead and saw the pool of water before stepping into it, but could not tell it covered a hole deep enough to cause a fall. When asked why she did not walk on the \u201cother part of the pavement,\u201d she replied, \u201cI did not think of it.\u201d At another point in her testimony she said, \u201cThere is constantly water there in different places\u201d; but she did not say there were other pools of water or that there was not sufficient room on the sidewalk for her to have avoided the particular pool in question.\nIn entering the nonsuit, the trial judge very properly stated: \u201cThere were other parts of the pavement upon \u2022 which she could have walked in safety......; she [preferred] testing a danger,......and injury resulted. I\nam of opinion her conduct was so negligent that she is not entitled to recover.\u201d\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
