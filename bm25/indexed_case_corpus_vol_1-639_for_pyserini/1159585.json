{"id": "1159585", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe question involved in this case was properly disposed of by the court below; accordingly the order of the court is affirmed on the following excerpts from the opinion of Judge Thomas, of the 56th Judicial District, specially presiding:\n\u201cP. H. Doyle died June 25,1928, a resident of [the Borough of Stroudsburg], and a paper writing dated April 29,1926, purporting to be his last will and testament was presented to the register of wills . . . for probate.\n\u201cTheresa O\u2019Mara, one of the decedent\u2019s daughters, filed a caveat against the probate of said paper writing. After due hearing the register entered a decree on November 4, 1929, admitting the said paper writing to probate as the last will and testament of P. H. Doyle, wherein he bequeathed and devised his entire estate to Katherine Y. Shull, and named her executrix, and letters testamentary were issued thereon to her.\n\u201cOn November 21, 1930, over a year after the probate, Theresa O\u2019Mara appealed from the register\u2019s decree to the orphans\u2019 court and presented a bond to the register in the sum of one thousand ($1,000) dollars with the Fidelity & Deposit Company of Maryland as surety, which bond was approved by the register.\n\u201cOn April 26, 1933, on petition of the executrix and sole heir to the orphans\u2019 court, a rule was granted to show cause why the appeal should not be dismissed for want of filing an appeal bond as required by the statute.\n\u201cThe question involved is, Whether the bond filed by the appellant in connection with her appeal is such a bond as is required by law. The bond in question reads [after reciting the names of the parties and amount of the bond] as follows:\n\u201c \u2018Whereas, the said Theresa O\u2019Mara on November 21, 1930, filed in the office of the Register of Wills of Monroe County, Pennsylvania, a caveat against the admission to probate of any paper writing alleged to be the last will and testament of P. H. Doyle, deceased, or the granting of letters testamentary on the Estate of P. H. Doyle, deceased.\n\u201c \u2018Now the Condition of this Obligation is, that if the said caveator shall pay any and all costs which may be occasioned by reason of such caveat, and which may be decreed by such Register of Wills or by the Orphans\u2019 Court of Monroe County to be paid by such caveator, then this obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.\u2019\n\u201cThe Wills Act of 1917, P. L. 424, reads: \u2018It shall not be lawful for any register of wills ... to entertain . . . any appeal from the probate of any . . . will . . . unless . . . appellants . . . shall, within ten (10) days after the filing of [the] appeal, enter into a bond . . . conditioned for the payment of all or any costs which may be occasioned by reason of such . . . appeal.\u2019 The act further sets forth that in case no bond such as aforesaid shall be filed, the appeal shall be considered as abandoned and dismissed.\n\u201cThe bond in this case is conditioned to pay costs that may arise on the caveat and not on the appeal. The proceedings on the caveat were ended and all costs paid. This bond contains no obligation on either the principal or surety to pay any costs on the appeal to the orphans\u2019 court, and the bond not complying with the statutory requirement is of no effect and is null and void, and is to be treated as if no bond had been filed: Bailey\u2019s Est., 281 Pa. 392.\n\u201cThe surety could successfully defend a suit on the bond. Its obligations cannot be extended by implication beyond the terms of its contract: Yubas v. Makransky, 300 Pa. 507-12.\n\u201cThe appellant sets forth in her brief that the court, having equitable powers, should permit revision of the bond and seeks \u2018leave of the court for this purpose.\u2019 This the court is powerless to do, as the Wills Act places sole responsibility on the register: Nicholas Est., 2 Lack. 421; Winklefoose\u2019s Est., 5 York 151.\u201d\nDecree affirmed at cost of appellant."}
