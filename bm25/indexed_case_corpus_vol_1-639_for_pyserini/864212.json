{"id": "864212", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nWe find nothing in this record that would have justified the rejection of defendant\u2019s claim to the $300 exemption, either on the ground that it was too late, or for other reasons suggested by plaintiff\u2019s exceptions thereto. The sale was not delayed, nor were costs incurred that might have been avoided bj^ an earlier presentation of the claim. There was therefore no error in dismissing the exceptions and discharging the rule to set aside the appraisement. The questions presented by plaintiff\u2019s exceptions have been sufficiently considered and properly disposed of in the opinion of the court below. For reasons there given the decree should not be disturbed.\nDecree affirmed and appeal dismissed with costs to be paid by appellant."}
