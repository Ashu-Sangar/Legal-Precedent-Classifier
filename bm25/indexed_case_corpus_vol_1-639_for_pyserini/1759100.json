{"id": "1759100", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nTestator, Robert Sewell, Sr., died in 1939, survived by his wife and three children, Robert Sewell, Jr., Elizabeth Sewell Odell and Beatrice Sewell Brown. By his will, testator bequeathed his entire estate to named trustees in trust for the benefit of his wife for life. In subparagraph First (c), testator directed the trustees, upon his wife\u2019s death,\n\u201cto pay over the net income in quarterly installments equally to my children then living and the issue of any children then deceased, including the issue of any children who predecease me, issue of deceased children taking the share their parent would take if living, and to continue such payments to my issue per stirpes until the death of my last surviving child.\u201d\nTestator\u2019s wife died in December, 1968. At the time of her death, only one child of testator, Beatrice Sewell Brown, was still living. Upon the orphans\u2019 court\u2019s confirmation of a first accounting, testator\u2019s trustees began to pay trust income exclusively to Beatrice Sewell Brown. Exclusive payments of income continued until March, 1975, when Beatrice Sewell Brown died.\nOn this second accounting, filed by trustees upon the death of Beatrice Sewell Brown, appellant Sharon Lee Watts challenged, as she now challenges on appeal, her exclusion from income payments under subparagraph First (c). Appellant is the adopted child of Robert Sewell, Jr., one of testator\u2019s children who predeceased testator\u2019s wife. Appellant was never given notice of the trustees\u2019 first accounting. Indeed, until the second accounting, appellant was unaware of the terms of her grandfather\u2019s bequest.\nThe trustees gave appellant notice of the second accounting, informing her of her right, under another clause of testator's will, to share in trust principal as a \u201cgrandchild.\u201d It was only upon notice of the second accounting that appellant learned of the exclusive payments of income to Beatrice Sewell Brown. Appellant then claimed that this Court\u2019s decision in Tafel Estate, 449 Pa. 442, 296 A.2d 797 (1972), permitting an adopted child to take under a bequest to \u201cchildren,\u201d entitled her to share trust income with Beatrice Sewell Brown as an \u201cissue of a deceased child.\u201d Although appellant does not contend that she should have been paid trust income before this Court\u2019s decision in Tafel, she does maintain that from the date of Tafel until termination of the trust the trustees erroneously made exclusive income payments to Beatrice Sewell Brown. Appellant contends that the trustees should be surcharged for making these exclusive payments from the time of Tafel until termination of the trusts. The orphans\u2019 court on the second accounting held that the trustees should not be surcharged. We disagree and, accordingly, vacate and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is axiomatic that \u201c[w]hen there are two or more beneficiaries of a trust, the trustee is under a duty to deal impartially with them.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 183 (1959). Accord, II Scott on Trusts \u00a7 183 (1967). By failing at the time of Tafel to confirm appellant\u2019s status as a beneficiary and continuing to make payments of trust income to Beatrice Sewell Brown, the trustees breached their duty as fiduciaries to deal impartially with appellant and Beatrice Sewell Brown.\nThe trustees attempt to justify their failure to treat appellant as an income beneficiary on narrow grounds. The trustees do not claim that they were unaware of this Court\u2019s decision in Tafel, nor do they dispute that appellant qualifies as an \u201cissue\u201d under testator\u2019s will. The trustees do not contend that they were unaware of appellant\u2019s existence. Rather, they concede otherwise:\n\u201c[W]e have known of the existence of [appellant] Sharon Lee Watts for many years. On January 6,1947 a notation was made on our docket card for the captioned trust to the effect that [Robert Sewell, Jr.\u2019s] wife had a child by a former marriage, Sharon Lee Melton. The entry continues . . . \u2018after the marriage the name of the child was changed to Sharon Lee Sewell and there is some question as to whether this child was ever adopted by [Robert Sewell, Jr.]\u2019 \u201d\nThe trustees\u2019 argument is that they had no \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of appellant\u2019s status and, in their view, cannot be surcharged for failing to recognize appellant\u2019s status as an income beneficiary. This view is based on an analogy to the duty owed by a fiduciary to beneficiaries upon the filing of an account. Under the Probate, Estates and Fiduciaries Code, a trustee \u201cshall give written notice of the filing of his account\u201d to unpaid claimants who give written notice of a claim and \u201cto every other person known to the accountant to have an interest in the estate as beneficiary, heir, or next of kin.\u201d See 20 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3503 & 7183(1). The trustees read the statutory language \u201cknown\u201d to mean that, unless a fiduciary is certain of a beneficiary\u2019s interest, there is no duty to inform or otherwise make provision for the beneficiary.\nAlthough the trustees insist that, based on the above docket entries, they had insufficient knowledge of appellant\u2019s status, the very docket entries they cite demonstrate otherwise. Since 1947, the trustees were aware that Robert Sewell, Jr.\u2019s wife had a child by a former marriage, and that the. child\u2019s name was changed to \u201cSharon Lee Sewell.\u201d Although the docket entry states that there is \u201csome question\u201d concerning appellant's status, the information the trustees did have presented more than enough evidence to require the trustees to confirm appellant\u2019s status.\nThe trustees\u2019 conduct at the time they filed their second account belies any claim that they were not substantially aware of appellant\u2019s status. At termination of the trust, when faced with testator\u2019s direction to distribute principal to testator\u2019s \u201cgrandchildren,\u201d the trustees had no new information concerning appellant\u2019s status. If the trustees believed that appellant was not in all probability adopted, there would be no reason then to inquire further. Yet the trustees inquired, easily confirmed that appellant was adopted, and informed her of her interest in the estate.\nThe trustees argue in the alternative that their exclusive payments of income to Beatrice Sewell Brown were required by a decree of the orphans\u2019 court confirming their first accounting. They conclude that, because they acted in accordance with this decree, they may not be surcharged. This contention, too, must be rejected. The trustees\u2019 premise, that fiduciaries may not be surcharged where they properly rely upon an adjudication of court directing payment of funds in their trust, is of course a sound one. \u201cThe beneficiary may be barred by a decree of a proper court from holding the trustee liable for a breach of trust.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Trusts, supra at \u00a7 220. Accord, III Scott on Trusts \u00a7 220, p. 1765 (1967). See, e.g., Halsey Appeal, 120 Pa. 209, 13 A. 934 (1888). This premise, however, can have no bearing where, as here, appellant\u2019s right to trust income never was \u201copen to dispute.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Trusts, supra at \u00a7 220 Comment a. Nothing in the decree of the orphans\u2019 court confirming the trustees\u2019 first accounting even purports to address appellant\u2019s claim on trust income. And there is nothing on the record to indicate that appellant then could have advanced her right to income. Appellant did not receive notice of the first accounting and was not otherwise aware of it. Compare Forsyth\u2019s Estate, 335 Pa. 281, 286-87, 6 A.2d 817, 819 (1939) (party participating in previous adjudication precluded from relitigating issues decided).\nOnly a subsequent decree of court, rendered following a proceeding at which appellant\u2019s right to trust income could have been put at issue, would provide the trustees the protection they now seek. In light of Tafel, the trustees could have obtained such a decree. See Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, Act of June 18,1923, P.L. 840, \u00a7 4,12 P.S. \u00a7 834 (1953), renumbered, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 7535. ^ See also Restatement (Second) of Trusts, supra at \u00a7 259 (\u201c[t]he trustee is entitled to apply to the court for instructions as to the administration of the trust if there is reasonable doubt as to his duties or powers as trustee\u201d). Here, however, the trustees failed to do so. Instead, they acted at their own peril and paid trust income exclusively to Beatrice Sewell Brown. Because this was error, we hold that the trustees must be surcharged.\nDecree vacated and case remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party pays own costs.\nMANDERINO, J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\n. At the time of the first accounting and throughout administration of the trust, appellant was a resident of Texas.\n. By subparagraph First (d) of his will, testator directed the named trustees to pay principal, upon the death of the last surviving child, \u201cto my grandchildren then living and the issue of any of my grandchildren then deceased. . . .\u201d The trustees determined appellant is a \u201cgrandchild\u201d entitled to take under this bequest. See infra note 3.\n. Nothing in the reasoning of the prevailing view expressed in Tafel would suggest that appellant would not be entitled to share in trust income as an \u201cissue.\u201d To the contrary, this Court has already held, in harmony with Tafel, that where no contrary intent appears, a bequest to \u201cissue\u201d includes an adopted child. Sykes Estate, 477 Pa. 254, 383 A.2d 920 (1978). See also Flinn Estate, 479 Pa. 312, 388 A.2d 672 (1978) (following view expressed in Tafel that \u201cchildren\u201d includes adopted children unless otherwise expressed). It should be noted that the trustees in their proposed distribution of principal in accordance with subparagraph First (d), see supra note 2, recognize the scope of Tafel includes bequests to \u201cgrandchildren.\u201d The trustees\u2019 accounting filed upon Beatrice Sewell\u2019s Brown\u2019s death seeks approval not only of distribution of income to Beatrice Sewell Brown but also a proposed distribution to testator\u2019s \u201cgrandchildren.\u201d This proposed distribution to \u201cgrandchildren\u201d includes two children of Beatrice Sewell Brown and also appellant.\n. Letter from Mrs.' A. R. Hammenway, Trust Officer, The Fidelity Bank, Stipulation of Counsel, Exhibit \u201cD,\u201d Record at 37a.\n. See supra note 2.\n. The record reveals that the trustees\u2019 inquiry into appellant\u2019s status was no onerous task. The trustees were able to confirm by phone conversation what their records already revealed. Thereafter they gave appellant notice of her interest. Appellant immediately responded. The trustees cite no evidence which would indicate that these same contacts could not have been made earlier.\n. Comment a provides:\n\u201cScope of the rule. The settlement of a trustee\u2019s account in a court having jurisdiction to settle his accounts renders res judicata matters which were open to dispute, whether or not actually disputed.\u201d\n. The sole issue then in dispute was whether David Dallas Odell, spouse of Elizabeth Sewell Brown (a child of testator who predeceased testator\u2019s wife) then had a right to take trust income pursuant to a testamentary appointment his spouse made pursuant to testator\u2019s will. Subparagraph First (d) of testator\u2019s will directed trustees to pay principal to testator\u2019s \u201cgrandchildren\u201d subject to the proviso that \u201cany child\u201d of testator may appoint \u201cany or all of the income from his or her proportionate share of the principal be paid to the surviving spouse of such child for and during the term of the natural life of such surviving spouse. . . .\u201d Elizabeth Sewell Brown exercised her power to appoint and David Dallas Odell claimed the appointment operated to give him an immediate right to income. The orphans\u2019 court disagreed and concluded that David Dallas Odell could take income only upon termination of the trust. (In accordance with this adjudication, the trustees\u2019 proposed statement of distribution provides for income to David Dallas Odell.)"}
