{"id": "1066119", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Sadler,\nThe executor of Barbara Monnia filed a final account of his trust, and by direction of the court made distribution of the balance in his hands. Subsequently, additional assets having been received, the administrator d. b. n. c. t. a. submitted a statement to the orphans\u2019 court. A claim to the fund so raised was made by the residuary legatees named in the will. After hearing, the court found to the contrary, and awarded the balance \u201cfor distribution under the provisions of the intestate laws of the Commonwealth to those entitled thereto,\u201d and directed the administrator to make such division. The parties who are thus indicated to receive are not named, nor are any shares fixed. From this decree, the present joint appeal was taken by three of the parties interested.\nDoes the record here show such a definitive decree as will sustain the present proceeding? Under the earlier acts, the orphans\u2019 court had exclusive jurisdiction to make and enforce distribution of estates of decedents (Ashford v. Ewing, 25 Pa. 213), and the same power is given by the Fiduciaries Act of 1917. The ascertainment of the next of kin for the purpose of distribution is within the scop\u00a7 of its allotted duties (Clement\u2019s Est., 160 Pa. 391); but it appears here that this finding of the necessary facts was committed to the accountant. It was doubtless intended he should prepare a schedule for submission and approval, but this was not done, and the record discloses nothing more than an interlocutory order: Bower\u2019s Est., 48 Pa. Superior Ct. 394. A decree, such as here made, which is uncertain in leaving undetermined the parties who are to take, is not final: Purviance v. Com., 17 S. & R. 31.\nThe situation is analagous to that found in cases where exceptions to an auditor\u2019s\u2019 report are sustained, and a distribution is ordered to be made in accordance with the directions given by the court. Such order is merely interlocutory, and no appeal lies until there is an absolute confirmation: Kaeir\u2019s Est., 264 Pa. 224; Hoyt\u2019s Est., 232 Pa. 189; Moore v. Lincoln Park & S. C. Co., 196 Pa. 519; Beach\u2019s Est., 30 Pa. Superior Ct. 572. Even though the appellate court can infer from the opinion filed what was intended, it cannot either affirm or reverse a decree which has never been entered: Dorscheimer\u2019s Appeal, 9 Pa. Superior Ct. 422. Under such circumstances, the appeal must be quashed, though the parties consent that the court assume-jurisdiction: Watkins v. Hughes, 206 Pa. 526.\nThis conclusion makes it not only unnecessary, but improper, to express any opinion on the merits of the case: Mitchell\u2019s App., 60 Pa. 502. When a final order is entered, the questions arising may be properly brought before the appropriate appellate tribunal. In this connection,- attention is called to the fact that the present proceeding is objectionable as a joint appeal: Reynolds v. Reynolds Lumber Co., 175 Pa. 437. It would further seem that none of the appellants had an individual interest sufficient in amount to give this court jurisdiction : Samson\u2019s Est., 201 Pa. 590; Samson\u2019s Est., 22 Pa. Superior Ct. 93; Staib\u2019s Est., 188 Pa. 238; McGlinn\u2019s Est., 270 Pa. 373.\nThe appeal is quashed, at the cost of appellants."}
