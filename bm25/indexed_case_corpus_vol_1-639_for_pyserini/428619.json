{"id": "428619", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, May 11th 1869, by\nRead, J.\nThe title by which the plaintiff claims the tract of land in Alsace township, Berks county, containing 86 acres, which is the subject of this ejectment, is the Statute of Limitations. His claim is as devisee of Susanna Hassler, the widow of Johannes Hassler, who died about the 1st February 1826, having made a will dated the 29th of December 1825, which was proved on the 13th February 1826. The widow died in June 1858, and her will, dated 29th September 1856, was not proved until the 4th February 1862. No executor was appointed by the will of the husband, but this land was specially mentioned in it. The widow appointed the plaintiff her executor, but this land was not mentioned or alluded to in her will, and her devisee claims it under the general words \u201c all my estate, real, personal and mixed, which I may own at the time of my decease.\u201d\nThe will of her husband gave Mrs. Hassler \u201c the use and benefit of all my property, movable and personal, together with all money that shall' be at my death, out on interest, so long as she liveth and r\u00e9maineth a widow, with liberty to appropriate the same to her sole use, where and in what manner she may think proper.\u201d\nTo ten god-children named in his will, he gave his personal property after the death of his wife, and the income of his plantation or farm during their lives, excepting four dollars yearly to the preacher of his congregation, and after their death to go to the use of our church.\nThe widow remained on the farm, and afterwards rented it, she living in Reading. The land, from 1827 to the commencement of this suit, was assessed as John Hassler\u2019s estate. Upon the death of Mrs. Hassler, the god-children by their tenants went into possession, and were in possession at the commencement of this action in 1862.\nThe evidence on the part of the plaintiff simply proved, that the widow remained on the farm, receiving the profits, and also when she removed to Reading to a house bought for her by the administrator of her husband\u2019s estate. There is but one expression testified to by one witness, which can be construed into her claiming adversely to the devisees of her husband. \u201c It is my property, and I will do with it what I please.\u201d\nOn the other hand, five witnesses prove clearly, that she had remained in possession and received the rents, under the belief that her husband had given her a life estate in it, so long as she remained a widow. \u201c She said Hassler had willed the farm to her as long as she had had his name; then, to the children they\u2019d held in baptism, of whom she was god-mother, and after their death it was to go to Spies\u2019s church.\u201d In this there was only one mistake, and that was as to her life interest, which is the true explanation of her taking the rents and profits, and negatives entirely any adverse claim or any intention to claim the property by the Statute of Limitations.\nThe learned judge submitted the whole question to the jury with proper instructions, and he is not dissatisfied with the verdict, which appears to have been a perfectly righteous one.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
