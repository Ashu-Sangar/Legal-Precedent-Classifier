{"id": "1063201", "contents": "The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered, March 10th 1879.\nPer Curiam.\nThe questions in this case were fairly submitted to the jury in a full and accurate charge by the learned president of the court below. The principles enunciated by him we consider as entirely settled in Brua\u2019s Appeal, 5 P. F. Smith 294, and Smith v. Bouvier, 20 Id. 325. In no view of the charge as a whole was it equivalent to a binding instruction for the defendant.\nJudgment affirmed."}
