{"id": "991650", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThe established practice in an appeal from a decree granting or dissolving a preliminary injunction is to determine only whether, under the facts shown, the discretion of the court was rightly exercised, and to express no opinion on the merits of the case: Paxson\u2019s Appeal, 106 Pa. 429; North Shore Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania Co., 231 Pa. 307. We see no adequate reason for reversing the decree appealed from and it is affirmed."}
