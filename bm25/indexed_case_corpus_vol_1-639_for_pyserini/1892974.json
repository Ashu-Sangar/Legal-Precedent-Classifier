{"id": "1892974", "contents": "Opinion\nPer Curiam,\nThis appeal is from the decree of the lower court which sustained defendants\u2019 demurrer to the evidence and dismissed the complaint.\nThe complaint, a taxpayers\u2019 suit, alleged that at a primary election the voters of the City of Bethlehem rejected a proposal to increase the city\u2019s indebtedness by $6,720,000 for the purpose of providing funds and toward the acquisition of land and the erection and equipping of an administration building, town hall, library and public safety building.\nSubsequent to the voters\u2019 rejection of the proposed increased indebtedness, the Bethlehem City Council initiated proceedings for the passage of two ordinances: (1) to organize Bethlehem City Center Authority under the provisions of the Act of May 2, 1945, P. L. 382, 53 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7301-322 and (2) a proposal to revise the city\u2019s capital budget. Both ordinances were passed on first reading. The complaint prays that defendants be enjoined from proceeding with the organization of the authority and from putting into effect the proposed revisions of the capital budget. Defendants filed their answer, admitted the results of the election and the passage on first reading of the two ordinances referred to, and denied that plaintiffs were entitled to equitable relief. At the conclusion of plaintiffs\u2019 case defendants demurred to the evidence. The chancellor sustained the demurrer and dismissed the complaint. An appeal was taken to this Court by one of the original plaintiffs. The complaint was properly dismissed because it was without merit.\nDecree affirmed at appellant\u2019s cost."}
