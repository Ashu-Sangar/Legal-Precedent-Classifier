{"id": "1941827", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Jones,\nFollowing a trial by jury, a verdict was rendered in favor of Scaife Company (plaintiff below and appellant in No. 43 March Term, 1970) and against, Rockwell-Standard Corporation (defendant below and appellant in No. 41 March Term, 1970) in the amount of $1,200,000.2s. While the court en banc denied Rockwell\u2019s motions for judgment n.o.v. and for a new trial, a new trial on the issue of damages was ordered unless Scaife filed a remittur damnum in the amount of $756,-001.28. Upon Scaife\u2019s failure to file this remittitur, the court below ordered a new trial limited solely to the question of damages and these cross appeals followed.\nA narration of the factual background of these appeals begins with Rockwell\u2019s merger on October 30, 1953, with the Timken-Detroit Axle Company and the concomitant acquisition of the Timken Silent Automatic (hereinafter TSA) division as a part of Rockwell\u2019s corporate structure. Although the TSA product was long considered the best in the oil-fired furnace industry, this type of business was far removed from Rockwell\u2019s chief concern, the manufacture of automotive parts. Moreover, reflecting the improvement and expansion of natural gas line facilities in the United States, the fuel furnace industry was drastically changing from oil-fired furnaces to natural gas-fired furnaces. Attempting to meet the challenge of its competitors, TSA developed and marketed its own gas-fired furnace.\nBesides this factual discussion, an explanation of the mechanical operation of a gas-fired furnace is necessary. The key component of a gas-fired furnace, simple but indispensable, is the heat exchanger. However, the TSA heat exchanger was defective in two respects: it was noisy and it cracked. As best stated by the court below, \u201c[f]or a Timken Silent Automatic furnace to make noise is one thing but for it to crack is another.\u201d For this reason the TSA gas-fired furnace was not functional and, therefore, not marketable.\nAlthough, it is a matter of some dispute whether Rockwell or Scaife initiated negotiations for the sale and purchase of the TSA division, negotiations did commence in the Fall of 1954. Reviewing the record, one fact is abundantly clear: Rockwell was very much aware of the defective condition of its heat exchanger and the effect of this d\u00e9fective component on the marketability of its final product. Besides numerous complaints by customers, Rockwell\u2019s cognizance of this problem is demonstrated, inter alia, by (1) its creation of a Heating Committee to scrutinize the situation; (2) its unavailing, trial-and-error method of improvement; and (3) Rockwell\u2019s establishment of an accounting reserve of $26,000.00 per month to permit the writing-off of the heat exchangers. To capsulize the controversy, Scaife allegedly knew none of these facts when the contract for the sale of the TSA division was executed on March 31, 1955.\nFor a period of many months, no allegation of fraud was pressed by Scaife and Scaife successfully developed a new type of heat exchanger. However, claiming that damage was already done, a complaint employing four theories of recovery was filed by Scaife. After receiving the evidence, the trial judge ruled that Scaife could go to the jury on only one of these theories: fraudulent misrepresentation. At this point we deem it wise to separate our discussion of these appeals.\nNo. 41 March Term, 1970\nThe primary issue of this appeal by Rockwell is whether there is sufficient evidence of fraudulent misrepresentation to justify the jury\u2019s verdict. Of course, if the evidence does not establish Rockwell\u2019s liability, we need not reach the issue presented by Scaife\u2019s appeal, No. 43 March Term, 1970, concerning the amount of damages.\nSummarizing the essential elements of this cause of action, Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Jones in Neuman v. Corn Exchange Nat. Bank and Trust Co., 356 Pa. 442, 450, 51 A. 2d 759, 763 (1947), stated, \u201cthere must be (1) a misrepresentation, (2) a fraudulent utterance thereof, (3) an intention by the maker that the recipient will thereby be induced to act, (4) justifiable reliance by the recipient upon the misrepresentation and (5) damage to the recipient as the proximate result.\u201d Accord, Eden Roc Country Club v. Mullhauser, 416 Pa. 61, 204 A. 2d 465 (1964); Savitz v. Weinstein, 395 Pa. 173, 149 A. 2d 110 (1959). Concerning the proof of fraud, our cases have consistently enunciated a very high standard. E.g., Yoo Hoo Bottling Co., Inc. v. Leibowitz, 432 Pa. 117, 247 A. 2d 469 (1968) (\u201cclear, precise and convincing\u201d) ; Gerfin v. Colonial Smelting and Refining Co., Inc., 374 Pa. 66, 97 A. 2d 71 (1953) (\u201cclear, precise and indubitable\u201d); New York Life Ins. Co. v. Brandwene, 316 Pa. 218, 172 Atl. 669 (1934) (\u201cclear and satisfactory\u201d). The question then becomes whether Scaife\u2019s proof of every element met this exacting standard.\nCombining the first and second criteria, we must examine whether a fraudulent misrepresentation was uttered. Initially, we note that a fraudulent misrepresentation can take many forms: \u201c \u2018fraud consists in anything calculated to deceive, whether by single act or combination, or by suppression of truth, or a suggestion of what is false, whether it be direct falsehood or by innuendo, by speech or silence, word of mouth, or look or gesture. It is any artifice by which a person is deceived to Ms disadvantage\u2019: [Citation omitted].\u201d Reichert Estate, 356 Pa. 269, 274, 51 A. 2d 615, 617 (1947). Besides our previous recitation of the facts, additional evidence in this regard, both documentary and testimomal, are very pertinent.\nFirst, during the negotiations, Scaife submitted twenty-six questions to Rockwell concerning the TSA division, including, inter alia: \u201cwhy is this division for sale?\u201d and \u201cwhat reasons for declining sales volume and faster decline of profits for recent years?\u201d Despite Rockwell\u2019s awareness of the defective heat exchanger, no mention was made of tMs factor. Second, Scaife was not permitted to question TSA\u2019s engineers and retail dealers during the negotiations. Third, testimony by various Scaife executives, if believed, indicated that any Mnt of trouble was excused by Rockwell officials as minor problems encountered daily by manufacturers. In light of the enormity of TSA\u2019s problem, we cannot reject the jury\u2019s implicit finding that Rockwell either deliberately evaded or actively concealed the true situation. Overall, we share the opirnon of the court en banc that, \u201cthere was sufficient evidence for the Court, as a matter of law, to submit to the jury and to justify the jury\u2019s finding that there was a false misrepresentation.\u201d\nThe third element\u2014an intention by the maker that the recipient would thereby be induced to act\u2014is easily satisfied. The rosy picture painted by Rockwell during the course of the negotiations, coupled with Rockwell\u2019s failure to disclose the malfunctioning of its heat exchanger, clearly supports the jury\u2019s verdict.\nAlthough neither party has specifically focused its argument on the fourth criterion\u2014justifiable reliance\u2014 it is evident from the facts stressed by each side that the crux of the legal controversy concerns this issue. Relying heavily on Emery v. Third Nat\u2019l Bank, 308 Pa. 504, 162 Atl. 281 (1932), Rockwell principally argues that Scaife knew or should have known of the defective heat exchanger and that any damage was essentially self-inflicted. On the other hand, one major facet of Scaife\u2019s position, discussed by the court in its charge, is that the long-standing business and personal relationship between the executives of each corporation, while not attaining the legalistic stature of a \u201cconfidential relationship\u201d, could justify a factual finding that Scaife reposed a specific confidence in Rockwell which was knowingly abused by Rockwell.\nIn Emery, this Court stated: \u201cA misrepresentation as to the subject of a proposed sale will not support an action for deceit if the subject be open to the buyer\u2019s observation. In Mahaffey v. Ferguson, 156 Pa. 156, 169, 27 A. 21, this court quoted approvingly the statement of Chancellor Kent, Commentaries, 2d volume 484-5, that the law does not go to the romantic length of giving indemnity against the consequences of indolence and folly, or a careless indifference to the ordinary and accessible means of information. The same opinion quotes from Slaughter v. Gerson, 13 Wallace 379, as follows: \u2018Where the means of knowledge are at hand and equally available to both parties, and the subject of purchase is alike open to their inspection, if the purchaser does not avail himself of these means and opportunities, he will not be heard to say that he has been deceived by the vendor\u2019s misrepresentations.\u2019 This court has consistently adhered to these principles. [Citations omitted].\u201d 308 Pa. at 511-12, 162 Atl. at 283. Utilizing this concept, Rockwell accentuates certain facts: (1) several marketing and engineering reports indicated TSA\u2019s sluggish entry into the gas furnace market; (2) Scaife executives had, at least, a glimmering of this problem; and (3) Dr. Anthony, a metallurgical engineer employed by the Mellon Institute, testified that it would be obvious from an inspection of the heat exchanger testing room (a Scaife official and Scaife\u2019s chief engineer had toured one of these rooms) that the heat exchanger was defective. However, the evidence introduced by Scaife repudiated each of these allegations. Owing to this extremely close, factual controversy occasioned by our rigorous standard of review as well as the possibility of a specific confidence reposed by Scaife in Rockwell, we believe the tidal judge did not err in allowing this case to go to the jury and that the jury\u2019s verdict is sufficiently supported by the evidence.\nOn these facts, there is undisputed evidence of continuous, business transactions between the corporations. Moreover, close, personal relationships existed between the executives of both companies. Of course, Rockwell contends that familiarity and personal relationships did not influence this business transaction. Accordingly, the trial judge, correctly employing this Court\u2019s language in Zahn v. McMillin, 179 Pa. 146, 153, 36 Atl. 188, 189-90 (1897), stated in his charge to the jury: \u201cl. . . there are cases where a party must not be silent upon a material fact within his knowledge, although he stands in no relationship of trust and confidence. If a party knows that another is relying upon his judgment and knowledge in contracting with him, although no confidential relation exists\u2014and I will say that none existed in this case\u2014and he does not state material facts within his knowledge, the contract will be avoided, for knowingly to permit another to act as though the action was confidential and yet not state material facts is fraudulent. It is said that a party, in such circumstances, is bound to destroy the confidence reposed in him or to state all the facts that such confidence demands.\u2019 \u201d See, also, Restatement of Torts, \u00a7542 (1938). Thus, the jury could have concluded that Rockwell knowingly abused Scaife\u2019s confidence which would further justify Scaife\u2019s reliance.\nHaving established each of the above elements of this cause of action, there is no question of proximately caused damages other than the extent thereof. On balance, we are of the opinion that Scaife introduced clear and satisfactory evidence upon which the jury determined that Scaife was the victim of Rockwell\u2019s fraudulent misrepresentation.\nRockwell next argues that Scaife\u2019s failure to complain or give notice of any breach for a period of nineteen months after the corporate takeover constitutes a waiver of any recovery. \u201cThe affirmance of a contract induced by fraud of the seller does not extinguish the right of the purchaser, and it is not a waiver of the fraud, nor does it bar the right of the purchaser to recover damages for the fraud. [Citation omitted].\u201d Tilghman v. Dollenberg, 418 Pa. 604, 610, 213 A. 2d 324, 327 (1965). \u201cAffirmance of the contract is not a waiver of the fraud; nor does it bar the right to recover; it does bar a subsequent rescission.\u201d Miller v. Central Trust & Savings Co., 285 Pa. 472, 486, 132 Atl. 579, 584 (1926). See, also, Emery v. Third Nat'l Bank, 314 Pa. 544, 171 Atl. 881 (1934). Accordingly, Scaife could affirm the contract and yet maintain this action for fraud.\nNo. 43 March Term, 1970\nAs noted earlier, Scaife\u2019s appeal questions the propriety of the new trial ordered by the court en banc limited to the issue of damages because of its conclusion that the verdict was excessive and Scaife\u2019s failure to file the required remittitur. Stated differently, the narrow issue presented is whether the combined award of $1,200,000.28, damages plus interest, is excessive.\nIn this area of law we begin with the well-recognized principle that the grant or refusal of a new trial because of the excessiveness of the verdict is peculiarly within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed unless an abuse of discretion or an error of law has been committed. See, e.g., Murphy v. Taylor, 440 Pa. 186, 269 A. 2d 486 (1970); Connolly v. Philadelphia Transp. Co., 420 Pa. 280, 216 A. 2d 60 (1966); Guzman v. Bloom, 413 Pa. 576, 198 A. 2d 499 (1964). Recognizing the difficult task encountered by an appellate court in reviewing the record when a trial court merely assigns conclusory statements\u2014\u201cinterests of justice,\u201d \u201cshocks the court\u2019s conscience\u201d and \u201csubstantial justice\u201d\u2014we have attempted to discourage this practice. See, Gilligan v. Shaw, 441 Pa. 305, 272 A. 2d 462 (1971) ; Hilliard v. Anderson, 440 Pa. 625, 271 A. 2d 227 (1970); Kralik v. Cromwell, 435 Pa. 613, 258 A. 2d 654 (1969) ; Beal v. Reading Co., 370 Pa. 45, 87 A. 2d 214 (1952); Bellettiere v. Philadelphia, 367 Pa. 638, 81 A. 2d 857 (1951). In HilUwrd, the defendant was granted a new trial upon the plaintiff\u2019s failure to file a remittitur solely because \u201cthe verdict shocked the conscience of the court\u201d. Primarly concerned with the \u201cshock the conscience\u201d test, we noted, \u201c[t]he court should state the reasons for this conclusion in order that we may have the opportunity of intelligently determining if an abuse of discretion occurred.\u201d 440 Pa. at 628, 271 A. 2d at 229. We now add the \u201cexcessive verdict\u201d conclusion to that list of judicial statements requiring additional, supporting reasons. See, Spangler v. Helm\u2019s New York-Pittsburgh Motor Express, 396 Pa. 482, 153 A. 2d 490 (1959).\nRelying on language in past decisions of this Court, Rockwell contends that tlie sole measure of damages in a case of this nature is the difference between the consideration paid for the property and its true market value, as of the date of the sale. See, Tilghman v. Dollenberg, 418 Pa. 604, 213 A. 2d 324 (1965); Neuman v. Corn Exchange Nat. Bank and Trust Co., 356 Pa. 442, 51 A. 2d 759 (1947). See, also, Restatement of Torts \u00a7549a (1938). Accordingly, Rockwell contends that Scaife\u2019s proof of its operating cost which included expenses required to produce and market the TSA product inflated the jury\u2019s verdict, whereas these figures should not have been presented to the jury. Since Scaife\u2019s evidence greatly exceeded the jury\u2019s verdict, we believe the trial judge abused his discretion in ordering a new trial after Scaife failed to file the required remittitur. We realize, however, that our conclusion begs the question whether Scaife\u2019s expenses and losses are includable in assessing damages.\nInitially, we recognize the position taken by many jurisdictions that losses and expenses incurred by the defrauded, party as a proximate result of the fraud may be recovered. See, 37 C.J.S. Framd \u00a7141 (1943); Restatement of Torts \u00a7549b (1938). Moreover, we noted in Neumam that, \u201c[w]hile formulated rules relating to the appropriate measure of damage in varying circumstances have to some extent become fixed, they are by no means immutable but bend to the exigencies of the particular case in order that just compensation may be ascertained and awarded\u201d. 356 Pa. at 457, 51 A. 2d at 766. Considering the demise of the oil-fired furnace industry, the steps taken by Scaife and the expenses thereby incurred to correct the defective heat exchanger can be fully justified as sound business practice and were proximately caused by Rockwell\u2019s misrepresentation. Additionally, Scaife\u2019s operating losses may not be equated with the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d rule prohibited in Neuman; whether all of these losses were proximately caused by Rockwell\u2019s fraud is, of course, a question for the jury. In short, to apply the measure of dam-, ages formula discussed in Tilghman to the sale of a \u201cdefective\u201d business would work a grave injustice. It is our opinion that the jury\u2019s verdict is fully supported by the evidence and should be reinstated.\nJudgment, as modified, is affirmed. The record is remanded with instructions to reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict. .\nMr. Justice Cohen took no part in the decision of this case.\nMr. Justice Pomeroy took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nThe jury awarded damages of $810,811.00, and interest of $389,189.28.\nThe three other theories were breach of contract, breach of warranties and unjust enrichment. The trial judge\u2019s rejection of these theories was not assigned as error before either the court en banc or this Court. Hence we will not consider this point.\nRockwell\u2019s argument Is primarily based on Section 2-607(3) of the Uniform Commercial Code, Act of April 6, 1953, P. L. 3, \u00a72-607(3), 12A P.S. \u00a72-607(3). Since the jury\u2019s verdict was based on fraudulent misrepresentation and not on any theory involving the Uniform Commercial Code, Section 2-607(3) is inapplicable. However, as hereinafter noted in our textual discussion, a similar, common law concept exists.\nPerhaps this reasoning was accepted by the trial judge; this, however, we cannot determine with certainty since no explanation was given. Nor can we make this determination from the jury\u2019s verdict since Scaife\u2019s suggestion, prior to the court\u2019s charge, that the jury be instructed to itemize its verdict was rejected as untimely by both Rockwell and the trial judge.\nRockwell also contends that the evidence presented by Scaife \u2014prepared summaries of Scaife\u2019s voluminous business records\u2014was inadmissible under the rules of evidence. Although the documents were available to Rockwell for several years prior to trial, no attempt was made to inspect these records until trial. Unfortunately, portions of this original mass of material were destroyed. Owing to this partial destruction as well as the sheer volume of these records, Scaife only introduced summaries. We do not believe this was error. See, IV Wigmore on Evidence \u00a71230 (3d ed. 1940). Even if there was error, there was no reversible error since Seaife\u2019s supporting witnesses were extensively cross-examined on these figures."}
