{"id": "1912389", "contents": "Opinion by\nMb. Justice Koberts,\nAppellant Frank S. Townsend was convicted by a judge sitting without a jury of two offenses under the Uniform Firearms Act, Act of June 24, 1939, P. L. 872, \u00a7628, as amended, 18 P.S. \u00a74628(d) and (e)\u2014possession of a firearm after a conviction of a crime of violence and possession of a firearm without a license. Concurrent sentences of one and one-half to three years were Imposed and these sentences were affirmed by an equally divided Superior Court. See Commonwealth v. Townsend, 209 Pa. Superior Ct. 406, 228 A. 2d 206 (1967). We granted allocatur.\nThere is no record evidence that Townsend had been convicted of a crime of violence. That conviction must therefore be reversed. See State v. Tully, 198 Wash. 605, 89 P. 2d 517 (1939). Townsend also contends that the evidence produced by the Commonwealth is insufficient to sustain his possession without a license conviction. We agree.\nThe Superior Court dissenters carefully summarized the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence (Commonwealth v. Townsend, supra at 407-08, 228 A. 2d at 207) : \u201cOn March 25, 1965, at approximately 8:45 p.m., police officers William Carlin and Fred Bacino were on duty in a patrol car near the intersection of Allegheny Avenue and Fox Street in Philadelphia. Carlin, the driver, observed a Bambler automobile about one car length in front of them which had stopped to let out one of its occupants, later identified as William A. Miller. As Miller was getting out of the right side of the car, Bacino saw a weapon fall to the ground and said to Carlin, \u2018That man dropped a gun, let us check them.\u2019 Miller picked up the gun and threw it on the back seat of the car. The officers approached on foot\u2014Bacino on the right side and Carlin on the left. Bacino asked Miller, \u2018What did you throw in the back seat?\u2019 Miller did not reply. Bacino looked into the back seat and saw a .32 automatic pistol.\n\u201cCarlin ordered the occupants\u2014Joseph L. Giambi [the driver] and appellant\u2014out of the car. They were searched, but no weapons were found.\n\u201cBacino later noticed a second gun\u2014a .22 Derringer\u2014partially concealed under the front seat on the passenger side. After securing a warrant for the car, a subsequent search revealed a shotgun under the hood. Appellant was tried jointly with Giambi and neither testified nor presented evidence on their behalf.\u201d\nNo weapons having been found on appellant\u2019s person, the Commonwealth premised its case upon a theory of joint possession. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Whitman, 199 Pa. Superior Ct. 631, 186 A. 2d 632 (1962). Two elements are essential to a finding of joint possession : the power of control over the weapon and the intention to exercise this control. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Thurman, 167 Pa. Superior Ct. 642, 76 A. 2d 483 (1950). Appellant concedes that the evidence was sufficient to sustain a finding of power of control, but insists that, under the doctrine of Whitman, the Commonwealth has failed to demonstrate any knowledge on his part of the presence of the weapons, an element which is a necessary predicate to a finding of intention to exercise control.\nAlthough the trial judge based his finding of guilt in great measure upon the fact that Townsend was sitting in the front seat (and thus the weapon partially concealed under the front seat would have been between Townsend\u2019s legs), there is absolutely no evidence of record indicating where Townsend was sitting. The totality of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on this point is contained in the following dialogue between the defense attorney and Officer Bacino: \u201cQ. When you went up to the automobile, isn\u2019t it a fact that Townsend was sitting in the middle of the automobile? A. I cannot recall that. Q. Giambi was driving, is that correct? A. Yes.\u201d\nThe Commonwealth must therefore rely on its contention that mere presence in a vehicle containing two weapons is sufficient to sustain a finding of guilt. To support this contention, it cites Commonwealth v. Whitman, supra; Commonwealth v. Pinckney, 194 Pa. Superior Ct. 371, 168 A. 2d 922, cert. denied, 368 U.S. 857, 82 S. Ct. 95 (1961) ; Commonwealth v. Hooe, 187 Pa. Superior Ct. 330, 144 A. 2d 580 (1958) ; and Commonwealth v. Thurman, supra. Each of these decisions is clearly distinguishable. In Pinohney and Thurman both defendants stated to the arresting officers that they were involved in offenses utilizing the items of which they were found in possession. Such a statement was never made by Townsend. Whitman was convicted of possession of burglary tools and possession of an unlicensed weapon. The crucial distinction between Whitman\u2019s conviction and that of Townsend is the very fact upon which the trial judge erroneously relied\u2014Whitman was sitting in the passenger\u2019s seat under which two weapons were found.\nHooe, according to the Commonwealth\u2019s brief, is its strongest case. Two narcotics officers observed Hooe and one Heflin, known narcotics users, in an automobile driven by Heflin. The\u2019 officers were apparently recognized and a chase ensued during which one of the officers observed Hooe reach down and disappear from sight; a moment later a white envelope was ejected from the car window. The envelope contained heroin. Hooe was later apprehended in Alabama. Two distinguishing circumstances are thus present\u2014Hooe\u2019s actions which gave rise to the permissible inference that he had ejected the envelope, and his subsequent flight. Not only was Townsend completely cooperative with the arresting officers, but there is not a shred of testimony beyond his mere presence to indicate that he was in any way associated with the weapons found.\nIn our opinion, Commonwealth v. Clinton, 391 Pa. 212, 137 A. 2d 463 (1958) controls. Reversing a conviction for joint possession of burglary tools, we there insisted that, in a prosecution based upon circumstantial evidence, conviction may not be based upon suspicion or conjecture, but rather the evidence must be such \u201c \u2018as reasonably and naturally to justify an inference of the guilt of the accused . . . and of such volume and quality as to overcome the presumption of innocence____\u2019\u201d Id. at 218-19, 137 A. 2d at 466. Clinton\u2019s conviction was based upon his presence in an automobile containing burglary tools; Townsend\u2019s upon his presence in an automobile containing weapons. We thus must reverse.\nThe order of the Superior Court is reversed and the judgment of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Philadelphia County is reversed.\nMr. Justice Jones dissents.\nThe Commonwealth apparently conceded in the Superior Court that the possession after a conviction of a crime of violence conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence. See Commonwealth v. Townsend, supra at 407 n. 1, 228 A. 2d at 207 n. 1 (dissenting opinion).\nThe Commonwealth attempted to establish that Miller was sitting in the back seat, creating the situation that Townsend was sitting either in the front seat above the concealed weapon or in the back seat next to Miller, who apparently had a weapon in his possession. However, the record discloses only that when Miller stepped from the automobile, he was in a \u201ccrouched\u201d or \u201cslightly bent over\u201d position. Given the fact that a Rambler is a compact car, Miller\u2019s position could just as easily have been a result of alighting from the front seat.\nWhen arrested, Townsend had several lacerations on his face. The Commonwealth attaches significance to these wounds as indicative of the fact that he was not just \u201calong for the ride.\u201d We fail to perceive how this fact aids the Commonwealth\u2019s case or in any way demonstrates that Townsend had knowledge of the weapons."}
