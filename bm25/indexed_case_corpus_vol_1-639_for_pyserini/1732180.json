{"id": "1732180", "contents": "OPINION\nPOMEROY, Justice.\nFollowing a trial by jury, appellant Michael Polimeni was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in connection with the shooting death of one Kenneth Patterson. Post-verdict motions were denied, and appellant was sentenced to a term of not less than three nor more than seven years imprisonment. In this direct appeal, Polimeni raises two issues: the first, a challenge to the array of the petit jury in the court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County; the second, a denial of a requested charge on involuntary manslaughter. We find the second claim to be meritorious and that a new trial must be had. Accordingly, we do not reach the merits of appellant\u2019s challenge to the array of the petit jury.\nI.\nAppellant contends that he was denied a fair trial because the trial judge declined to charge the jury, as requested, on the offense of involuntary manslaughter. The point for charge was refused because the appellant had not been indicted for and thus could not properly be convicted of that offense. The trial court\u2019s action was in accord with the prevailing case law in this Court. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hoffman, 439 Pa. 348, 266 A.2d 726 (1970); Commonwealth v. Reid, 432 Pa. 319, 247 A.2d 783 (1968); Commonwealth v. Edwards, 431 Pa. 44, 244 A.2d 683 (1968); Commonwealth v. Soudani, 398 Pa. 546, 159 A.2d 687 (1960); Commonwealth v. Comber, 374 Pa. 570, 97 A.2d 343 (1953); Commonwealth v. Palermo, 368 Pa. 28, 81 A.2d 540 (1951); Commonwealth v. Hardy, 347 Pa. 551, 32 A.2d 767 (1943); Hilands v. Commonwealth, 114 Pa. 372, 6 A. 267 (1886); Walters v. Commonwealth, 44 Pa. 135 (1863). But see and compare Commonwealth v. Thomas, 403 Pa. 553, 170 A.2d 112 (1961).\nWe have recently held that where it appears that the prospective evidence would support a verdict of involuntary manslaughter, it is error for the trial court to refuse to consolidate for trial an indictment for murder and voluntary manslaughter and an indictment charging involuntary manslaughter. Commonwealth v. Moore, 463 Pa. 317, 344 A.2d 850 (1975). See also Commonwealth v. Stock, 463 Pa. 547, 345 A.2d 654 (1975). The opinions by Mr. Justice EAGEN announcing the judgments of the Court in Moore and Stock did not address, because it was not necessary to do so, the issue now before us, i.c., whether, absent an indictment for involuntary manslaughter, a charge on that offense is required if properly requested. On the facts presented in those cases, the failure to consolidate indictments was by itself a sufficient ground for new trials. We have concluded, however, that the rationale of the Moore and Stock decisions is equally applicable to the case at bar.\nThe basis of the ruling in Moore, as set forth in the plurality opinion of Mr. Justice Eagen, is that\n\u201c . . . if a jury, giving credence to a defendant\u2019s version of an encounter could find that defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter, fundamental fairness dictates the consolidation, upon request, of that indictment with the murder and voluntary manslaughter indictments as possible jury verdicts.\u201d 463 Pa. at 322, 344 A.2d at 852-853.\nThe practical consequence, indeed, the purpose of this ruling was to permit a charge of involuntary manslaughter. In the words of the plurality opinion, \u201cfailure to so acquaint the jury prevents it from operating with full knowledge of the relevant law and precludes the defendant from having a fair trial.\u201d Id. We hold, therefore, that where in a trial of a case on a murder indictment there is present from whatever source evidence which would permit the fact-finder to return a verdict of involuntary manslaughter, a defendant is entitled, upon request, to a charge on the elements of that offense.\nIt is arguable that the result we reach today could be derived through application of the common-law concept of lesser included offenses and a determination that involuntary manslaughter, like voluntary manslaughter, is a lesser included offense of murder. Voluntary manslaughter has long been so regarded in Pennsylvania, and authority elsewhere would support the proposition that, properly considered, involuntary manslaughter is also a lesser included offense of murder. We need not, however, consider whether the common law rule in Pennsylvania should be changed, for we are of the opinion that our holding in the case at bar is required by the new Pennsylvania Crimes Code, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 101 et seq., which was in effect at the time of the commission of the crimes here involved. This case being one of first impression under the Code, it is necessary to consider the structure of that legislation and the definitions therein contained by which we must be guided.\nThe Crimes Code in Chapter 25, for the first time in Pennsylvania, establishes an offense known as \u201ccriminal homicide\u201d. A person is guilty of this crime \u201cif he intentionally, knowingly, recklessly or negligently causes the death of another human being.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2501(a). The Code then states that \u201c[cjriminal homicide [is] classified as murder, voluntary manslaughter, or involuntary manslaughter.\u201d Ibid. \u00a7 2501(b). (Emphasis supplied.) Murder is in turn divided into three categories: murder of the first degree, murder of the second degree, and murder of the third degree. Ibid. \u00a7 2502. Murder of the first degree and of the second degree under the Crimes Code together correspond to murder in the first degree under prior law; the new murder of the first degree is an intentional killing, while the new murder of the second degree is felony-murder. Murder of the third degree is comprised of \u201call other kinds of murder\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(c) (Supp. 1977-1978), thus taking the place of the former murder in the second degree, which the Penal Code described in the same words. The remaining two species of criminal homicide are voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter. They also are defined in the Crimes Code in the same basic terms as in prior law. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2503, 2504.\nWe think that the structure of Chapter 25 of the Crimes Code in which the above cited sections appear is such as to create one major homicide offense, that of criminal homicide, and that the several types of homicide, namely, murder of any of the three named degrees and voluntary and involuntary manslaughter are constituent subsidiary offenses within the single major offense. All grades of unlawful killing thus have been made lesser included offenses of the overall crime of criminal homicide. The differences between the classifications are largely a function of the state of mind of the perpetrator. This becomes clear when one examines the ranking for culpability purposes of the several categories of criminal homicide. Premeditated, intentional killing and killing in the course of committing a felony continue to be equated as the most highly culpable classes of criminal homicide. A felonious and malicious killing without a specific intent to take life (murder of the third degree, formerly second degree) is placed by the Code in the next highest degree of culpability, a felony of the first degree. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502(c). Next in seriousness is. a killing which, although intentional, is committed when the actor is under the influence of a sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation or is acting in the unreasonable belief that the circumstances would justify a killing. This subdivision of criminal homicide, voluntary manslaughter, is punishable as a felony of the second degree. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2503. Involuntary manslaughter, with which we are here concerned, is committed when the death of a person is caused as a direct result either of a lawful act or of an unlawful act done in a \u201creckless or grossly negligent manner,\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2504. In the scale of culpability, such a killing is a misdemeanor of the first degree. Id. \u00a7 2504(b).\nLike murder of the third degree, involuntary manslaughter is an un intentional killing. See Commonwealth v. Jones, 452 Pa. 569, 308 A.2d 598 (1973). What is more important for our present purposes is the fact that under the Crimes Code it is a killing which requires a state of mind which is in effect simply a gradation on the ascending scale of culpability culminating in malice. The state of mind which characterizes involuntary manslaughter is not malicious; it is referred to as \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d and is evidenced by acts, whether lawful or unlawful, done in a \u201creckless or grossly negligent\u201d manner as those terms are defined. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2504; see also n. 17, supra; Commonwealth v. Jones, 452 Pa. 569, 578-79, 308 A.2d 598 (1973). In Commonwealth v. Aurick, 342 Pa. 282, 288-89, 19 A.2d 920, 923 (1941), this Court stated that to constitute involuntary manslaughter \u201c \u2018[t]he negligence must be such a departure from what would be the conduct of an ordinary prudent or careful man under the circumstances as to evidence a disregard of human life or an indifference to consequences.\u2019 \u201d See also Commonwealth v. Root, 403 Pa. 571, 170 A.2d 310 (1961); Commonwealth v. LaPorta, 218 Pa.Super. 1, 272 A.2d 516 (1970); Commonwealth v. Clowser, 212 Pa.Super. 208, 239 A.2d 870 (1968); Commonwealth v. Hartle, 200 Pa.Super. 318, 188 A.2d 798 (1963).\n'We thus hold, to summarize, that because the legislature has classified both murder and involuntary manslaughter as subdivisions of the major offense of criminal homicide, a defendant who has been charged with murder is entitled on request to have the jury instructed on the elements of involuntary manslaughter at least where evidence is presented at his trial on which a verdict of that less serious offense could rationally be based.\nII.\nIt remains to determine whether from the evidence in this case a jury might rationally conclude that Michael Polimeni was guilty of involuntary manslaughter. As noted above, the Crimes Code definition of involuntary manslaughter is substantially declaratory of our previous law:\n\u201cA person is guilty of involuntary manslaughter when as a direct result of the doing of a lawful action in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, or the doing of a lawful act in a reckless or grossly negligent manner, he causes the death of another person.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2504(a) (1973).\nSee also 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 302(b)(3) and 302(b)(4) (1973), supra n. 17, where the Code defines reckless and negligent conduct. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the appellant we must then determine whether the jury could find defendant\u2019s actions to have been unintentional but \u201creckless or grossly negligent\u201d within the meaning of the Code provisions. The evidence at trial showed the following sequence of events:\nOn the evening of August 22, 1973, Michael Polimeni, the appellant, invited one Nicky Dellaquilla and one William Grande to the house appellant shared with his brother, Peter Polimeni. The purpose for the proposed meeting was to discuss some missing pills and a pill bottle belonging to Polimeni which he believed Dellaquilla had stolen. When Dellaquilla and Grande arrived at appellant\u2019s home at about 11:30 p. m., there were with them four other men: David Dowling, John Dyer, Frederick Kostanich and Kenneth Patterson. Surprised at seeing the others, appellant went into his bedroom alone, removed a loaded .38 caliber pistol from the safe there and placed the gun in his back trouser pocket. He thereupon joined the others, including his brother Peter, in the downstairs game room. A discussion ensued between himself and Dellaquilla concerning the missing pills, with the appellant at one point threatening to notify the police of Dellaquilla\u2019s alleged thievery. At that point, Kostanich intervened and turned the discussion towards an auto theft and crash involving Dellaquilla, one Churchill and a car belonging to a friend of Polimeni\u2019s.\nAppellant began to poke Kostanich in the chest and request that he depart from his home. It was then that Patterson, who apparently had been about to leave, came back into the game room, raised his right hand into the air and announced, \u201cThis is the hand of God.\u201d Polimeni responded, \u201cWell, f-u- and the hand of God.\u201d Patterson then advanced on Polimeni, grabbed him around the neck and began choking him, saying, \u201cThis is the hand of God, it is going to kill you.\u201d At this point Peter Polimeni joined the scuffle and removed Patterson\u2019s hands from his brother\u2019s neck, but Patterson again grabbed at Michael Polimeni, who then removed the gun from his pocket and said to Patterson, \u201cGet out of my house or I\u2019ll shoot.\u201d \u201cShoot, mother f\u2019r,\u201d responded Patterson. Beginning to feel faint and as if he might \u201cblack out,\u201d appellant pushed Patterson away from him with one hand, and with the other began to fire his gun. He emptied the five shot pistol, striking Patterson three times and wounding him mortally.\nFrom this account, three defense arguments may be drawn: (1) Polimeni justifiably killed Patterson in self-defense, and was guilty of no crime; (2) Polimeni\u2019s fear of his life was not reasonable, or he used excessive force in countering Patterson\u2019s attack on him, in either of which events appellant\u2019s crime would be voluntary manslaughter; (3) Polimeni\u2019s actions were reckless in that he consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk that death or serious bodily harm might result to Patterson from Polimeni\u2019s pulling his gun and firing, in which case appellant would be guilty of involuntary manslaughter. 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2504(a); 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(b)(3). The third alternative is weakened, to be sure, by appellant\u2019s admission that he knew he was aiming the gun at the victim, but this came on cross-examination after appellant had given conflicting versions (\u201cI don\u2019t know if I was aiming it\u201d; \u201c. . . didn\u2019t really aim, just pulled [the gun] out kind of in the direction our bodies were, so I didn\u2019t know what part of his body I was aiming at or anything.\u201d) Despite the ambiguity and ambivalence of these statements the jury could have concluded that Polimeni\u2019s conduct was in the category of recklessness (involuntary manslaughter) rather than of intentional killing either under sudden and intense passion resulting from serious provocation by Patterson or in the unreasonable belief that the killing would be justified (voluntary manslaughter).\nThe resolution of these conflicting interpretations of the facts is for the jury, which, of course, has authority to believe all, part of or none of a witness\u2019 testimony. Commonwealth v. Marlin, 452 Pa. 380, 305 A.2d 14 (1973); Commonwealth v. Oates, 448 Pa. 486, 295 A.2d 337 (1972); Commonwealth v. Petrisko, 442 Pa. 575, 275 A.2d 46 (1971).\nIn conclusion, we think that Mr. Justice EAGEN\u2019s statement in Commonwealth v. Stock, supra, 463 Pa. at 553, 345 A.2d at 657 (opinion announcing the decision of the Court) is equally germane to the case at bar:\n\u201cWe believe the evidence presented would have supported a verdict of involuntary manslaughter. The jury, crediting Stock\u2019s testimony could have determined the fatal wounding of Rhodes was unintentional and accidental. Furthermore, the jury, applying its knowledge and experience, could have concluded that Stock\u2019s conduct which contributed to the killing, while unlawful and criminally negligent within the definition of involuntary manslaughter, was not so negligent as to reach the level of recklessness and wantonness required for a murder conviction. Therefore, since the jury could have viewed Stock\u2019s conduct as coming within the ambit of involuntary manslaughter, it was error for the trial court . . . [not] to present involuntary manslaughter as a possible verdict.\u201d (Footnotes omitted)\nJudgment of sentence is reversed and case remanded for a new trial.\nJONES, former C. J., did not participate in the decision of this case.\nROBERTS, J., filed a concurring opinion in which O\u2019BRIEN, J., joins.\nMANDERINO, J., filed a concurring opinion.\nNIX, J., filed a dissenting opinion.\n. The requested charge was as follows:\n\u201cThere is a fourth type of homicide in the law of Pennsylvania; it is known as Involuntary Manslaughter. Defendant is not charged with this offense, but it is necessary that you understand what it is as an aid to your evaluation of the facts of this case. Involuntary Manslaughter does not involve malice as I have defined that term for you, malice being an essential element of murder. It is an unintentional killing, unlike Voluntary Manslaughter which is an intentional killing without malice based upon sufficient provocation.\n\u201cInvoluntary Manslaughter occurs where criminal negligence is the proximate cause of a person\u2019s death. Involuntary Manslaughter occurs by the commission of a lawful act in an unlawful manner or by the commission of an act not reasonably calculated to cause death or great bodily harm, but where the act is nevertheless an unlawful one.\n\u201cIn the instant case, if you find that defendant did not act with malice and that he did not intend to kill Kenneth Patterson and if you further find that defendant was resisting an attack but used excessive force \u2014 force out of proportion to what was necessary to protect himself \u2014 then you could find that defendant\u2019s resistance was the doing of a lawful act in an unlawful manner. Defendant would therefore, under those circumstances, be guilty of Involuntary Manslaughter and not guilty of the charges in the indictment before you.\u201d\nWe note that in the last paragraph of this point for charge the defendant\u2019s counsel was confusing some of the elements of voluntary manslaughter with those of involuntary manslaughter. This error does not, however, mean that the requested instruction taken as a whole was not sufficient to alert the court to the need to include mention of the subject matter in its charge. See Commonwealth v. Sisak, 436 Pa. 262, 259 A.2d 428 (1969).\n. In Moore, two members of this Court, Mr. Justice Roberts and the present writer, separately concluded that a defendant is entitled to a charge on involuntary manslaughter, if requested, irrespective of whether there has been an indictment for that offense, at least where the evidence is of such a nature that involuntary manslaughter would be a rational verdict, i.e, one supported by the evidence.\n. In Keeble v. United States, 412 U.S. 205, 213, 93 S.Ct. 1993, 36 L.Ed.2d 844, 850 (1973), the Supreme Court made the following comment:\n\u201c[W]hile we have never explicitly held that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees the right of a defendant to have the jury instructed on a lesser included offense, it is nevertheless clear that a construction of . . [the federal act in question] to preclude such an instruction would raise difficult constitutional questions.\u201d\n. The general rule in this jurisdiction and elsewhere is that a trial court need not charge concerning an included offense unless there is a \u201crational basis\u201d for acquitting the defendant of the offense charged and convicting him of the included offense. See Commonwealth v. Jones, 452 Pa. 569, 308 A.2d 598 (1973); Commonwealth v. Pavillard, 421 Pa. 571, 220 A.2d 807 (1966). See the American Law Institute\u2019s Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.07(5) and comment thereto. Tentative Draft No. 5 of the Model Penal Code at 42.43; Sansone v. United States, 380 U.S. 343, 349, 85 S.Ct. 1004, 1009, 13 L.Ed.2d 882, 887-888 (1965). See also Keeble v. United States, 412 U.S. 205, 208, 93 S.Ct. 1993, 1995, 36 L.Ed.2d 844, 847 (1973); McAllister v. State, 74 Wis.2d 246, 246 N.W.2d 511 (1976); People v.

Dougherty, 550 P.2d 175 (Utah 1976).\nIn part II of this opinion, infra, we conclude that there was evidence in this case from which the jury could justifiably have found that the appellant, while not guilty of murder, was guilty of involuntary manslaughter. Consequently, there is no need for us now to decide whether and under what circumstances a different rule, not dependent on evidential considerations, should be adopted in Pennsylvania. This question has not been argued to us and we express no opinion upon it. As Mr. Justice Roberts put it in Commonwealth v. Moore, 463 Pa. 317, 344 A.2d 850, 855-56 (1975), we \u201cneed not decide whether rationality should be a requirement for a permissible verdict, for in this case, a verdict of involuntary manslaughter would have been rational.\u201d 463 Pa. at 328, 344 A.2d at 856 (concurring opinion of Roberts, J.).\nTo be contrasted with the general rule is the situation which obtains in Pennsylvania relative to voluntary manslaughter, long recognized in this jurisdiction as a lesser included offense of murder; the court on request must charge on that offense regardless of whether there is any evidence to support such a verdict. See Commonwealth v. Jones, 457 Pa. 563, 319 A.2d 142 (1974); United States exrel. Matthews v. Johnson, 503 F.2d 339 (3d Cir. 1974), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 952, 95 S.Ct. 1336, 43 L.Ed.2d 430 (1975); Commonwealth v. Cain, 471 Pa. 140, 369 A.2d 1234 (1977). See also Commonwealth v. Matthews, 446 Pa. 65, 78, 285 A.2d 510 (1971) (dissenting opinion of this writer, joined by Mr. Justice ROBERTS). The reasons for this are historical: it having long been the law in Pennsylvania that a jury has the \u201cpower\u201d to return a verdict of voluntary manslaughter on a murder indictment even absent any evidence of the elements of manslaughter, see, e.g., Commonwealth v. Hoffman, 439 Pa. 348, 266 A.2d 726 (1970), due process of law was violated in the failure to charge on that offense on request. In contrast, the law in Pennsylvania until now has been that a jury had no power to return a verdict of involuntary manslaughter absent an indictment for that offense. The voluntary manslaughter anachronism is thus no precedent for what the rule should be with respect to involuntary manslaughter.\n. The doctrine of lesser-included offenses is of common law origin. See, e.g., Kelly v. United States, 125 U.S.App.D.C. 205, 370 F.2d 227, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 913, 87 S.Ct. 2127, 18 L.Ed.2d 1355 (1966); United States v. Markis, 352 F.2d 860 (2d Cir. 1965); Commonwealth v. Kellyon, 278 Pa. 59, 122 A. 166 (1923); Hunter v. Commonwealth, 79 Pa. 503 (1875); Commonwealth v. Gable, 7 S. & T. 433 (1829); F. Wharton, Criminal Law and Procedure (13th ed., 1972, C.E. Torcia ed.) \u00a7 545; C.A. Wright, 2 Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 515, at 372 (1969); American Law Institute, Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.07(4) (Proposed Official Draft, 1962). The common law concept is succinctly stated in Rule 31(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure:\n\u201c(c) Conviction of Less Offense. The defendant may be found guilty of an offense necessarily included in the offense charged or of an attempt to commit either the offense charged or an offense necessarily included therein if the attempt is an offense.\u201d\nFor a discussion of federal case law defining the phrase \u201cnecessarily included\u201d under this rule, see J. Wm. Moore, 8 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00a7 31.03 (1972).\nThe concept of \u201clesser included\u201d offenses is not always confined to those which are \u201cnecessarily included\u201d, either by statutory definition or by reason of the facts in a particular case, although the terms are frequently used interchangeably. Offenses which are \u201clesser included\u201d even though not \u201cnecessarily\u201d in that category are sometimes called \u201ccognate lesser included offenses.\u201d For discussions of the problems of definition and application involved in the included offenses concept, see, inter alia, D. Koenig, The Many-Headed Hydra of Lesser Included Offenses: A Herculean Task for the Michigan Courts, Vol. 1975 Detroit College of Law Review 41 (1975); B. George, Lesser Included Offenses in Michigan, Vol. 1975 Detroit College of Law Review 35 (1975); J. Barnett, The Lesser-included Offense Doctrine: A Present Day Analysis for Practitioners, 5 Conn. L.Rev. 255 (1972); Note, The Doctrine of Lesser Included Offenses in Kansas, 15 Washburn L. Journal 40 (1976); Note, Lesser Included Offenses: Application of Equal Standards to the Prosecution and Defense in Lesser Included Offense Situations, 4 Toledo Law Review 273 (1973).\n. The Model Penal Code \u00a7 1.07(4), note 5, supra, provides that one offense is included in another when\n\u201c(a) it is established by proof of the same or less than all the facts required to establish the commission of the offense charged; or\n(b) it consists of an attempt or solicitation to commit the offense charged or to commit an offense otherwise included therein; or\n(c) it differs from the offense charged only in the respect that a less serious injury or risk of injury to the same person, property or public interest or a lesser kind of culpability suffices to establish its commission.\u201d\nWe note that the General Assembly, although adopting portions of the Model Penal Code into the Crimes Code, did not incorporate \u00a7 1.07(4) of the Model Code. We do not, however, consider this a mark of disapprobation of the Model Code formulation of the doctrine of lesser-included offenses.\n. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Jones, 457 Pa. 563, 319 A.2d 142 (1974); Commonwealth v. Bailey, 450 Pa. 201, 299 A.2d 298 (1973); Commonwealth v. Kenney, 449 Pa. 562, 297 A.2d 794 (1972); Commonwealth v.

This further subdivision of murder so as to create a third degree of that offense was added to the Crimes Code by the Act of March 26, 1974, P.L. 213, No. 46 \u00a7 4, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2502 (Supp. 1977-78).\n. Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872 \u00a7 701, as amended, 18 Pa.C.S.A. App. \u00a7 4701. The definition of this classification of criminal homicide under the Crimes Code, therefore, like the definition of murder in the second degree under the former Penal Code, is to be derived from the common law. See Commonwealth v. Drum, 58 Pa. 9 (1868). See also Commonwealth v. Palmer, 448 Pa. 282, 292 A.2d 921 (1972); Commonwealth v. Tyrrell, 405 Pa. 210, 174 A.2d 852 (1961); Commonwealth v. Daley, 2 Clark 361 (1844). \u201cMalice\u201d is an essential element of this variety of homicide. Commonwealth v. Boyd, 461 Pa. 17, 22-23, 334 A.2d 610, 613 (1975); Commonwealth v. Buzard, 365 Pa. 511, 76 A.2d 394 (1958); Commonwealth v. McLaughlin, 293 Pa. 218, 142 A. 213 (1928). See also Commonwealth v. Hornberger, 441 Pa. 57, 270 A.2d 195 (1970); Commonwealth v. Malone, 354 Pa. 180, 47 A.2d 445 (1946). Mr. Justice Agnew\u2019s description of malice in Commonwealth v. Drum, supra, is still the classic statement of that element of criminal homicide:\n\u201cMalice . . . comprehends not only a particular ill-will, but every case where there is wickedness of disposition, hardness of heart, cruelty, recklessness of consequences, and a mind regardless of social duty . . .\u201d (emphasis added). 58 Pa. at 15.\n. Cf. the prior provision in the Penal Code, Act of June 24, 1939, P.L. 872, \u00a7 703, 18 Pa.C.S.A.App. \u00a7 4703. For culpability purposes, the new Code grades voluntary manslaughter as a felony of the second degree for conviction of which a sentence to a term of imprisonment of not more than ten years may be imposed; involuntary manslaughter is classed as a misdemeanor of the first degree, carrying a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 106.\n. Causing or aiding suicide is also a ground for conviction of criminal homicide. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2505. Such conduct is not, however, stated to be a \u201cclassification\u201d of criminal homicide. See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2501(b).\n. The punishments which the Crimes Code attaches to the several classifications of crimes are set forth in \u00a7 106 of the Code.\n. Both are grouped together under the rubric of \u201cmurder of the first degree\u201d as the first category of crime for culpability purposes, i. e., permissible sentences applicable to different classes of criminal offenses. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 106 (Supp. 1977-78).\n. \u201cRecklessly\u201d is defined in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(b)(3):\n\u201cA person acts recklessly with respect to a material element of an offense when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that, considering the nature and intent of the actor\u2019s conduct and the circumstances known to him, its disregard involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation.\u201d\n\u201cNegligently\u201d is defined in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 302(b)(4):\n\u201cA person acts negligently with respect to a material element of an offense when he should be aware of a substantial and unjustifiable risk that the material element exists or will result from his conduct. The risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor\u2019s failure to perceive it, considering the nature and intent of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor\u2019s situation.\u201d\nThe Crimes Code definitions of the two types of manslaughter are substantially the same as under prior law. See Commonwealth v. Moore, supra, 463 Pa. at 330, n. 15, 344 A.2d at 857, n. 15 (concurring opinion of ROBERTS, J.).\n. Whether the trial judge may so instruct the jury sua sponte is not now before us. See and compare Walker v. United States, 135 U.S.App.D.C. 280, 418 F.2d 1116 (1969); State v. Herron, 349 S.W.2d 936, 940 (Mo.1961); Tarter v. State, 359 P.2d 596, 600 (Okl.Cr.App. 1961); State v. Nodine, 198 Or. 679, 259 P.2d 1056 (1953).\n. Commonwealth v. Moore, supra, 463 Pa. at 321 22, 344 A.2d at 852.\n. This account is primarily a summary of Michael Polimeni\u2019s own testimony.\n. Michael Polimeni testified as follows on direct examination:\n\u201c. - . I kind of felt motion from the right side of me so I kind of turned and then Patterson grabbed me again and that\u2019s when I went back and pulled the gun out. I said, \u2018Get out of my house or I\u2019ll-shoot you,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Shoot, mother f\u2019r,\u2019 and I kind of started fainting and \u2014 started blacking out. And then I was trying to push him off me and I was shooting at the same time. ******\n\u201cMy head was kind of swelling. The only thing I knew, my head was getting heavier and heavier. I just kept on shooting the gun.\u201d N.T. 293-4.\n\u201cQ. Were you aiming the gun at all?\nA. I don\u2019t know if I was aiming it, I was just pushing and shooting the gun.\u201d N.T. 295.\n\u201cQ. Can you describe to us the sensation you felt when he grabbed you?\nA. I just felt like my head was getting heavier and heavier and I was getting light headed like, and I was just getting scared and start [sic] shooting.\u201d N.T. 299.\n******\n\u201cQ. Did you consciously point the weapon at Patterson?\nA. Consciously? I kind of pulled it out, aimed \u2014 didn\u2019t really aim, just pulled it out kind of in the direction our bodies were, so I didn\u2019t know what part of his body I was aiming at or anything.\u201d N.T. 300.\n******\n\u201cQ. Was it your intention to kill him?\nA. No sir.\nQ. What was your intention?\nA. Get him off me.\u201d N.T. 300 01.\nOn cross-examination Polimeni testified in part as follows:\n\u201cQ. How much time elapsed between the first and second shots?\nA. After I shot the first shot I didn\u2019t know if I hit him or what, and I was still trying to push him, I was hesitant on the second shot because I didn\u2019t know if I hit him or what, but he still seemed pretty strong and I was still like getting, you know, like going out, and I just started pressing the trigger after that.\n******\n\u201cQ. Were you aiming at Kenneth Patterson?\nA. I guess so, I pulled it out and he was in the general vicinity. I wasn\u2019t aiming for a specific part of the body or anything.\nQ. You knew you were aiming at him?\nA. Yes sir.\u201d N.T. 340.\nThe prosecution version of what occurred that evening differed from the above in the following particulars: the alleged purpose of the meeting in Polimeni\u2019s house was to discuss the stealing and wrecking of a car belonging to one Klingensmith; Patterson never actually grabbed appellant and said only \u201cTake it easy man, don\u2019t worry about it, God will take care of it\u201d; nonetheless, appellant started to scream, pulled the gun and fired five times, twice after Patterson had been felled."}
