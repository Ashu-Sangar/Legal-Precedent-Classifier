Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment in favor of Mr. Zarreii and denying summary judgment to Angi-no & Rovner, P.C. where the facts are undisputed that Mr. Zarreii, an adult, knowingly and voluntarily entered into a contingent fee agreement with Angino & Rovner, P.C. that required the payment of a 20% fee if Mr. Zarreii discharged the Angino & Rovner Law Firm and secured other counsel, particularly under circumstances where the Angino & Rovner Law Firm had prepared the underinsured motorist case completely to the point of selecting arbitrators and awaiting an arbitration hearing.\nb. Are attorneys prohibited per se from including a reasonable fee recovery provision in contingent fee agreements that governs the termination of the attorney-client relations prior to the occurrence of the contingency.\nc. Are discharged attorneys entitled only to the equitable remedy of quantum meruit for services rendered to former clients.\nd.
