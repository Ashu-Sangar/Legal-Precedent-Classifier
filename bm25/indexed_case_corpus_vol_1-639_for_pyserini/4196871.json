{"id": "4196871", "contents": "OPINION\nJustice GREENSPAN.\nWe permitted this appeal in order to review the Superior Court\u2019s decision under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9714, Sentences for Second and Subsequent Offenses, commonly referred to as the \u201cThree Strikes Law.\u201d The precise question is whether the Superior Court panel properly determined that the New York statute of Arson in the Third Degree, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 150.10, does not constitute an offense equivalent to the Pennsylvania statute of Arson Endangering Persons, 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 3301(a)(1). We conclude that the two offenses are not equivalent. As a result, we hold that the Superior Court did not err in concluding that a New York conviction for Arson in the Third Degree cannot serve as a prior crime of violence under Section 9714(a)(1). We affirm the Superior Court\u2019s order vacating the judgment of sentence and remanding the matter for resentencing.\nAppellee Carl Northrip (\u201cAppellee\u201d) was convicted of multiple counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse (IDSI), statutory sexual assault, incest, and corruption of minors in connection with repeated sexual attacks upon his 12-year-old daughter. Prior to sentencing, the Commonwealth sought application of Section 9714(a), which provides for a mandatory minimum sentence in the event a defendant has a prior conviction for a crime of violence. The Commonwealth\u2019s request was based on Appellee\u2019s prior conviction in New York for Arson in the Third Degree after he set fire to a building called Main Street Auto. The Three Strikes Law includes among its list of crimes of violence \u201carson as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3301(a)\u201d or \u201can equivalent crime in another jurisdiction.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9714(g). The trial court agreed that the mandatory minimum set forth in Section 9714 applied and ultimately sentenced Appellee to 30 to 60 years in prison.\nOn direct appeal to the Pennsylvania Superior Court, Appellee asserted that the trial court erred in applying Section 9714. Specifically, Appellee argued that New York\u2019s statute of Arson in the Third Degree was not equivalent to the specific Pennsylvania arson provision listed in Section 9714. The Superior Court agreed; it vacated the judgment of sentence and remanded the matter for resentencing. We granted the Commonwealth\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal, limited to the following question:\nWhether the Pennsylvania Superior Court erred by determining that [Appellee\u2019s] conviction for Arson in the Third Degree, as defined in N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 150.10, was not an equivalent offense to Arson as defined in the Pennsylvania Crimes Code at 18 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 3301(a), and thus, not a crime of violence as defined by 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 9714(g)?\nThe issue before us is one of statutory construction that implicates the legality of the sentence imposed. As a result, our standard of review is de novo and the scope of our review is plenary. Commonwealth v. Samuel, 599 Pa. 166, 961 A.2d 57, 60-61 (2008); Commonwealth v. Collins, 564 Pa. 144, 764 A.2d 1056, 1057 n. 1 (2001).\nAlthough the statute generally is referred to as the Three Strikes Law, the facts in this case concern Appellee\u2019s \u201csecond strike,\u201d as Section 9714 provides that any person convicted of a crime of violence shall be subject to a minimum sentence of at least ten years if, at the time he committed the offense, he had previously been convicted of a crime of violence. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9714(a). In defining the term \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d the Legislature set out explicit direction:\nAs used in this Section, the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d means murder of the third degree, voluntary manslaughter, aggravated assault as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702(a)(1) or (2) ... rape, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse, aggravated indecent assault, incest, sexual assault, arson as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3301(a) ... kidnapping, burglary of a structure adapted for overnight accommodation in which at the time of the offense any person is present, robbery as defined in 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701(a)(l)(i), (ii) or (iii), or robbery of a motor vehicle, or criminal attempt, criminal conspiracy or criminal solicitation to commit murder or any of the offenses listed above, ... or an equivalent crime in another jurisdiction.\n42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9714(g) (emphasis supplied).\nThe resolution in this case rests on the interpretation of the phrase \u201cequivalent crime in another jurisdiction.\u201d The Pennsylvania crime at issue in this case is defined as follows:\n(a) Arson endangering persons.\u2014\n(1) A person commits a felony of the first degree if he intentionally starts a fire or causes an explosion, or if he aids, counsels, pays or agrees to pay another to cause a fire or explosion, whether on his own property or on that of another, and if:\n(i) he thereby recklessly places another person in danger of death or bodily injury, including but not limited to a firefighter, police officer or other person actively engaged in fighting the fire; or\n(ii) he commits the act with the purpose of destroying or damaging an inhabited building or occupied structure of another.\n18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3301(a).\nThe New York crime is defined as follows:\n1. A person is guilty of arson in the third degree when he intentionally damages a building or motor vehicle by starting a fire or causing an explosion.\n2. In any prosecution under this section, it is an affirmative defense that (a) no person other than the defendant had a possessory or proprietary interest in the building or motor vehicle, or if other persons had such interests, all of them consented to the defendant\u2019s conduct, and (b) the defendant\u2019s sole intent was to destroy or damage the building or motor vehicle for a lawful and proper purpose, and (c) the defendant had no reasonable ground to believe that his conduct might endanger the life or safety of another person or damage another building or motor vehicle.\nN.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 150.10.\nWhile this Court has not spoken on what constitutes an equivalent crime under Section 9714, it has considered the very same term in the context of a previous version of the Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) statute. See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3731(e), repealed by 2003, Sept. 30, P.L. 120, No. 24, \u00a7 14, effective February 1, 2004. Section 3731\u2019s framework provided for enhanced sentences each time a defendant faced sentencing on a DUI conviction following conviction of a previous DUI offense or \u201can equivalent offense ... in [another jurisdiction.\u201d Id. In Commonwealth v. Shaw, 560 Pa. 296, 744 A.2d 739 (2000), this Court considered whether the defendant\u2019s prior conviction in New York for Driving While Ability Impaired, N.Y. Veh. & Traf. Law \u00a7 1192(1) (\u201cDWAI\u201d), was an offense equivalent to Pennsylvania\u2019s DUI statute. Beginning with the standard to be applied in determining equivalency, this Court formally adopted the rationale of a Superior Court case that addressed the precise issue:\n[A] sentencing court [must] carefully review the elements of the foreign offense in terms of classification of the conduct proscribed, its definition of the offense, and the requirements for culpability. Accordingly, the court may want to discern whether the crime is malum in se or malum prohibitum, or whether the crime is inchoate or specific. If it is a specific crime, the court may look to the subject matter sought to be protected by the statute, e.g., protection of the person or protection of the property. It will also be necessary to examine the definition of the conduct or activity proscribed. In doing so, the court should identify the requisite elements of the crime \u2014 the actus reus and mens rea \u2014 which form the basis of liability.\nHaving identified these elements of the foreign offense, the court should next turn its attention to the Pennsylvania Crimes Code for the purpose of determining the equivalent Pennsylvania offense. An equivalent offense is that which is substantially identical in nature and definition [to] the out-of-state or federal offense when compared [to the] Pennsylvania offense.\nShaw, 744 A.2d at 743 (quoting Commonwealth v. Bolden, 367 Pa.Super. 333, 532 A.2d 1172, 1175-76 (1987)).\nThe Shaw Court went on to compare New York\u2019s DWAI statute with Pennsylvania\u2019s DUI statute and determined that the two were not equivalent because the former \u201cprotected] the public from a broader range of reckless behavior\u201d than did the latter. Shaw, 744 A.2d at 744. Noting that New York\u2019s law punished drivers suffering from any alcohol related impairment and Pennsylvania punished only those drivers who suffered substantial impairment, the Shaw Court concluded that the New York statute cast a \u201cwider net,\u201d which constituted an \u201cappreciable difference\u201d in the elements of the two crimes and so precluded a finding of equivalency. Id. at 744-45.\nIn the matter sub judice, the Superior Court concluded that the Shaiv majority\u2019s test for equivalent offenses in the DUI context applied to analyses under the Three Strikes Law. Indeed, the Superior Court had applied Shaw in a Three Strikes case several years earlier. See Commonwealth v. Ward, 856 A.2d 1273, 1277 (Pa.Super.2004) (applying the Shaw test for equivalent offenses in a Section 9714 case and concluding that the appellant\u2019s New York robbery conviction was equivalent to a conviction under Pennsylvania\u2019s robbery statute at 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701(a)(1)(h)).\nIn their briefs before this Court, the parties agree that the standard set out in Shaw is applicable in this case. Each concedes that in determining whether offenses are equivalent for purposes of applying Section 9714, the court must consider the elements underlying the two statutes, as well as the classification of the crimes, their definitions, and their requirements. The parties likewise concede that the Superior Court applied the Shaw standard as required. The Commonwealth, however, insists that the Superior Court erred because it went beyond Shaw\u2019s test of reviewing the elements, definitions, and other requirements of the relevant statutes. Specifically, the Commonwealth takes issue with the panel\u2019s inquiry into whether \u201ceach and every factual scenario, whether speculative or not, [is] proscribed by both statutes.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 14. This additional analysis, argues the Commonwealth, prompted the panel to conclude \u2014 improperly\u2014that the statutes were not equivalent. Id.\nOur task is to determine: 1) precisely what standard is to be applied when making an equivalency determination under Section 9714 and 2) whether the two statutes at issue here are equivalent.\nThe Commonwealth is correct that the Superior Court focused its inquiry primarily on whether there was any possibility that an act of arson would result in conviction under New York\u2019s law and would not result in conviction under the allegedly equivalent Pennsylvania law. The panel stated:\n[T]he critical inquiry is whether any factual scenario sufficient for conviction of New York section 150.10 would correspondingly have been insufficient for conviction under Pennsylvania section 3301(a).\nCommonwealth v. Northrip, 945 A.2d 198, 210 (Pa.Super.2008) (emphasis supplied).\nThe panel fashioned such a scenario and, applying the following rationale, determined that the two statutes simply could not be deemed equivalent:\nFor example, a person might intentionally set fire to an abandoned, isolated, and remote building, of which another person had a possessory or proprietary interest. If he reasonably believes that firefighters would not respond and place themselves in danger because of the building\u2019s remote location, he would nonetheless be subject to prosecution under New York section 150.10 because he would fail to meet the first requirement of pleading an affirmative defense under that section. See N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 150.10(2) (requiring a defendant to prove, inter alia, that \u201cno person other than the defendant had a possessory or proprietary interest in the building\u201d or that all persons \u201cconsented to the defendant\u2019s conduct\u201d in order to have an affirmative defense). However, he would not be subject to prosecution under Pennsylvania section 3301(a) because he would not have placed another in danger of bodily injury, pursuant to subsection (a)(l)(i), or destroyed an inhabited building or occupied structure of another, pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(h). See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3301(a)(1). Instead, the highest-graded arson offense of which he could be convicted is Pennsylvania section 3301(c), which is not a crime of violence in Pennsylvania.\nId. at 210-11.\nThe Commonwealth characterizes the Superior Court\u2019s analysis as a fatal error and claims that its additional inquiry into potential fact patterns was \u201cspeculative\u201d and improper. In response, Appellee asserts that the panel\u2019s consideration of hypothetical factual scenarios did not adversely affect its analysis; it merely demonstrated that the two statutes were not equivalent. Appellee urges us to affirm the Superior Court\u2019s decision, despite its reliance on hypothetical facts, because the panel ultimately (and properly) applied the Shaw test.\nThe Superior Court certainly concluded that the \u201ccritical inquiry\u201d in this case was whether it could imagine \u201cany factual scenario\u201d that would result in a conviction in New York and an acquittal in Pennsylvania. Northrip, 945 A.2d at 210. But the Three Strikes Law neither directs nor requires the court to consider every possible set of circumstances in order to determine whether the mandatory sentence applies. Rather, Section 9714 simply sets out a specific statutory provision, in this case Section 3301(a)(1), and provides that the sentencing court must impose a mandatory minimum sentence if it finds the defendant has been convicted of a crime that is \u201cequivalent\u201d to that statutory provision in another jurisdiction.\nIn determining whether a foreign state\u2019s statute is equivalent to a Pennsylvania crime under Section 9714, we hold that the sentencing court is to apply the test this Court articulated in Shaw. Thus, the court must consider \u201cthe elements of the foreign offense in terms of classification of the conduct proscribed, its definition of the offense, and the requirements for culpability.\u201d Shaw, 744 A.2d at 743 (citation omitted). With respect to the underlying policy of the statutes, we hold that analysis of policy considerations is appropriate, though not controlling. See Shaw, 744 A.2d at 744-45 (noting the relevance of the statutes\u2019 policies but rejecting the Commonwealth\u2019s claim that the statutes were equivalent merely because they shared a policy of punishing impaired drivers).\nDespite our agreement with the Commonwealth that consideration of hypothetical scenarios is unwarranted when determining equivalency for purposes of Section 9714, we disagree with the Commonwealth that the court must in every instance consider the actual facts underlying a defendant\u2019s prior, out-of-state conviction. The Commonwealth insists that the panel should have inquired into the actual facts underlying Appellee\u2019s New York arson conviction. Had it done so, the Commonwealth maintains, it would have concluded \u2014 as did the trial court \u2014 that Appellee\u2019s conduct would be deemed culpable under both statutes, thereby malting them equivalent for purposes of Section 9714.\nAgain, we look to Section 9714 for direction. Both the statute\u2019s structure and its plain language demonstrate that for most crimes, the focus is not on the facts underlying a conviction, but rather on the statute that triggered the conviction. Section 9714\u2019s reach is targeted and specific. With respect to arson, the statute sets out a singular subsection\u2014 Section 3301(a). Section 9714 does the same with other crimes, listing either a single type of crime or a specific subsection or subsections of particular crimes, most of which are first-degree felonies. For example, a conviction for voluntary manslaughter, rape, or deviate sexual intercourse qualifies as a crime of violence under Section 9714. Two of seven aggravated assault subsections are included in the definition (18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2702(a)(1) and (2) \u2014 both first-degree felonies) and three of five robbery subsections (18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3701(a)(1)\u00ae, (ii), and (iii) \u2014 all felonies of the first degree) make the list.\nEven more telling is the fact that with respect to burglary, Section 9714 does not set out a statutory subsection at all. Instead, it explicitly directs the sentencing court to apply a fact-based test for determining whether the prior conviction is a crime of violence. Section 9714 includes only one type of burglary in its purview- \u2014 one that is not set out in a specific subsection of the burglary statute: \u201cburglary of a structure adapted for overnight accommodation in which at the time of the offense any person is present.\u201d 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9714(g). See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3502 (defining burglary as the unlawful entry onto a premises with the intent to commit a crime therein, regardless of whether someone else is present).\nThis very specific and deliberate method of defining crimes of violence in Section 9714 demonstrates the Legislature\u2019s clear intent that with respect to all crimes except burglary, the focus is on the crime for which the defendant was convicted, not the factual scenario underlying that crime. Section 9714 both directs and limits the sentencing court\u2019s inquiry. In keeping with the statute\u2019s mandate then, we must focus on the crime of arson and its elements, not the facts underlying Appellee\u2019s conviction.\nApplying the Shaw test to the instant matter, we conclude that the Superior Court correctly determined that the New York statute and the Pennsylvania statute are not equivalent for purposes of applying Section 9714. At first glance, the laws appear to have similar elements and burdens of proof. Both punish a person for intentionally setting a structure on fire and both define the word structure to include a place of business. However, the framework of the two statutory schemes reflects striking differences in terms of the \u201cclassification of the conduct proscribed\u201d and the \u201csubject matter sought to be protected.\u201d Shaw, 744 A.2d at 743. First, the New York statute describes a third-degree felony; the Pennsylvania provision describes a felony of the first-degree. Moreover, the New York law focuses plainly on the protection of property. The Pennsylvania law decidedly does not. Significantly, the Pennsylvania subsection is titled \u201carson endangering persons\u201d and a different, separate subsection is titled \u201carson endangering property.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3301(c). Pennsylvania punishes, as a second-degree felony, the deliberate starting of a fire with the intent to destroy or damage a building or structure adapted for carrying on business. Likewise significant is the fact that New York\u2019s other arson statutes specifically address injury to persons and assign higher grades to those offenses. See N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 150.15 (arson in the second-degree) and 150.20 (arson in the first-degree).\nIn light of the material differences between these two statutes, we conclude that the Superior Court was correct in determining that the New York offense was not equivalent to the Pennsylvania offense. As a result, the panel properly concluded that a mandatory minimum sentence under Section 9714 was not proper and the sentence imposed must be vacated.\nAccordingly, we affirm the Superior Court\u2019s order vacating the judgment of sentence and remanding the matter for resentencing without application of Section 9714. Jurisdiction relinquished.\nChief Justice CASTILLE and Justices SAYLOR, EAKIN and BAER, TODD, and McCAFFERY join the opinion.\nChief Justice CASTILLE files a concurring opinion in which Justice TODD joins.\nJustice SAYLOR files a concurring opinion.\n. The trial court sentenced Appellee as follows. On the first count of IDSI: 10 to 20 years; on the second count of IDSI: 10 to 20 years, to be served consecutively; on the first count of Incest: 10 to 20 years to be served consecutively; on the second count of Incest: 10 to 20 years, to be served concurrently; on the third count of Incest: 10 to 20 years, to be served concurrently; on the fourth count of Incest: 10 to 20 years, to be served concurrently; on the first count of Statutory Sexual Assault: 18 to 36 months, to be served concurrently; on the second count of Statutory Sexual Assault: 18 to 36 months to be served concurrently; on the third count of Statutory Sexual Assault: 18 to 36 months, to be served concurrently; on each of six counts of Corruption of Minors: 6 to 12 months, to be served concurrently.\n. A person who is convicted of a crime of violence and has two prior convictions for crimes of violence arising from separate criminal transactions (the \"third strike\u201d) is subject to a mandatory term of 25 years, unless the court determines that such punishment is insufficient to protect public safety. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9714(a)(2). In such a case, the court may sentence the individual to life in prison without parole. Id.\n. Pennsylvania law defines \"occupied structure\u201d as \"any structure, vehicle or place adapted for overnight accommodation of persons or for carrying on business therein, whether or not a person is actually present.\u201d 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3301(j).\n. New York law defines \"building\u201d as \"its ordinary meaning [as well as] any structure, vehicle or watercraft use for overnight lodging of persons, or used by persons for carrying on business therein.\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 150.00.\n. Section 3731 was repealed in 2004. In its place, the Legislature enacted a DUI statutory framework that, like its predecessor Section 3731, provides for enhanced sentences for convictions that follow a first DUI offense. See 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 3802-06. Under the revised statutory scheme, the first DUI offense carries a mandatory minimum sentence of six months probation; the second offense carries a mandatory minimum prison term of five days; the third offense carries a mandatory prison term of ten days. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3804(a). The law provides for harsher sentences, likewise subject to enhancement for second and third offenses, in the cases of drivers who have high rates of blood alcohol, those involved in accidents, those who refuse blood testing, and those who drive commercial vehicles or school buses. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3804(b); (c). In revising the DUI laws, the Legislature did away with the term \u201cequivalent offense.\u201d The statute now provides for enhanced sentences following convictions for offenses \"substantially similar\u201d to Pennsylvania's previous and current DUI statutes. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3806(a)(3).\n. The Shaw Court noted that a plurality of this Court had adopted the Superior Court\u2019s Bolden approach in Commonwealth v. Robertson, 555 Pa. 72, 722 A.2d 1047 (1999). Shaw, 744 A.2d at 743.\n. In a concurring opinion, then-justice Cappy, joined by then-justice Zappala and Justice Saylor, voiced agreement with the conclusion that the statutes were not equivalent, but disagreed with the Majority\u2019s standard for equivalency. Specifically, the concurring justices believed that the equivalency inquiry should focus only on the essential elements of each offense; underlying policy comparisons were unwarranted. Shaw, 744 A.2d at 745. (Cappy, J., concurring).\n. This is so, the Commonwealth argues, because Appellee set fire to a business in New York and so would have been convicted of Section 3301(a) in Pennsylvania because the property was one adapted \"for carrying on business therein.\" See 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3301(j).\n. In Commonwealth v. Samuel, 599 Pa. 166, 961 A.2d 57 (2008), this Court held that it was for the sentencing court to determine whether a defendant's act of burglary satisfied the factual requirements of Section 9714. Id. at 63. The Samuel Court recognized that the Section 9714 definition of burglary did not mirror that set out in the burglary statute. Id. at 62 (citations omitted).\n. As noted above, the majority of offenses deemed crimes of violence in Section 9714 are first-degree felonies.\n. Section 3301(c), Arson Endangering Property, is not listed as a crime of violence under Section 9714."}
