{"id": "551792", "contents": "The opinion of the court was filed March 7th, 1887.\nPee Curiam.\n\u2014 The reasons stated in the opinion of the learned judge clearly justify the court in refusing to strike oft the judgment. Not only were the laches too great, under the undisputed facts, for the defendant below to successfully invoke the aid of the equitable power of the court, but the judgment had also been regularly and duly revived: Duff v. Wynkoop, 74 Pa. St., 305.\nJudgment affirmed."}
