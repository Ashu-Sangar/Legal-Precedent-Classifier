{"id": "1802547", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nFLAHERTY, Justice.\nWe granted the petition for allowance of appeal of Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cJ & L\u201d) to determine whether our decision in Beissel v. W.C.A.B. (John Wanamaker, Inc.), 502 Pa. 178, 465 A.2d 969 (1983) precludes termination of disability payments under 77 P.S. \u00a7 771, where the payments were made under a mistaken belief that the cause of an employee\u2019s disability was work-related.\nAppellee, claimant under The Pennsylvania Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736, art. 1, as amended, 77 P.S. \u00a7 1 et seq., (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d) suffered back pain caused by an acute lumbo sacral strain after operating a mobile crane during the course of his employment. He notified his employer within a few days of the occurrence, and then sought treatment at local hospitals. Under a notice of compensation payable dated October 10, 1977, claimant began receiving biweekly disability payments of $199.00 commencing July 30, 1977. On October 13, 1977, Dr. El Attar, a physician for J & L, requested claimant\u2019s hospital records. Based upon that review, Dr. El Attar concluded that claimant\u2019s disability was not work-related, but was the result of the advanced stage of an underlying illness contracted during World War II. Dr. El Attar\u2019s conclusion was further supported by observations of claimant after the commencement of compensation payments, where claimant exhibited new symptoms which were consistent with Dr. El Attar\u2019s diagnosis and which were not claimed to be work-related.\nIn December 1978, J & L filed with the department of labor and industry a petition to review the referee\u2019s award grounded upon an alleged \u201cchange in the nature and character of claimant\u2019s disability.\u201d In support of its petition, J & L offered evidence which tended to prove, not that there had been a change in the nature of claimant\u2019s disability, but rather that the cause of claimant\u2019s disability was not work-related. The referee accepted J & L\u2019s evidence, and, upon concluding that claimant\u2019s disability was unrelated to his work, the referee entered an order terminating disability benefits effective December 4, 1978. On appeal the Board affirmed.\nAuthority for the referee\u2019s award is provided at 77 P.S. \u00a7 771 (Supp.1986) as follows:\nA referee of the department may, at any time, review and modify or set aside a notice of compensation payable and an original or supplemental agreement^] or upon petition filed by either party with the department, or in the course of the proceedings under any petition pending before such referee, if it be proved that such notice of compensation payable or agreement was in any material respect incorrect.\n[Emphasis supplied.] There can be no question that an agreement or notice of compensation payable which provides for payment for a disability which is not work-related at its outset is materially incorrect. Wertz v. W.C.A.B. (Ferro Corp.), 90 Pa.Cmwlth.Ct. 515, 496 A.2d 90 (1985).\nCommonwealth Court reversed the termination of benefits, citing our recent opinion in Beissel, supra. Beissel was a workmen\u2019s compensation claimant who underwent surgery for a bad back 13 months after she slipped and fell at work. Four written medical reports, including three prepared for employer\u2019s insurance carrier, indicated that Beissel\u2019s back problems were related to her fall. An agreement was reached between Beissel and her employer\u2019s insurance carrier, and nearly two years after the accident, the employer filed a notice of compensation payable for a lower back injury. After paying compensation for almost two years, the employer filed a petition for termination of benefits and produced evidence in the form of testimony of yet another physician indicating that Beissel\u2019s back problem\u2019s were caused by a \u201ccoughing and laughing spell\u201d which occurred 10 days prior to her fall.\nWe reversed the termination of Beissel\u2019s benefits, stating: \u201cSince [employer] had an opportunity to, and in fact did, investigate the cause of [Beissel\u2019s] disability, the notice of compensation payable [employer] filed constitutes an admission of its liability to [Beissel] for compensation for a lower back injury.\u201d 502 Pa. at 183, 465 A.2d at 971. The instant case is distinguishable from Beissel because the record does not show that J & L actually investigated claimant\u2019s condition prior to the notice of compensation payable. On the contrary, the record demonstrates that J & L commenced payment of disability benefits prior to its investigation of the causes of claimant\u2019s disability. After its investigation of claimant\u2019s condition was complete, J & L determined that the condition was never work-related and thus, that the notice of compensation payable was, in the language of \u00a7 771, incorrect in a material respect.\nCommonwealth Court also based its decision upon a perceived potential for abuse if employers are permitted to repeatedly challenge the cause of a claimant\u2019s disability. This observation is certainly consistent with the spirit of our decision in Beissel, where we reversed an order terminating benefits. There, two years after compensation payments commenced and in spite of the fact the compensation award was based upon the opinions of three of the insurer\u2019s own physicians, the employer sought to terminate claimant\u2019s disability payments when yet another physician reviewed the case and opined that all his predecessors were wrong in their assessment of the cause of claimant\u2019s disability. Repeated litigation of the cause of a claimant\u2019s injury is wasteful and, thus, to be avoided. However, there is no hint on this record that J & L is guilty of such abuse.\nIn short, we cannot ignore the clear provision of \u00a7 771 that compensation may be terminated where it is paid under a notice of compensation which is materially incorrect. The Act imposes upon employers the duty to promptly commenee payment of compensation and the cause of an employee\u2019s disability may not always be obvious. Where, as here, an employer promptly commences payment of compensation prior to commencement or completion of investigation into the cause of claimant\u2019s injuries and later determines that the claimant\u2019s disability was never work-related, in the absence of evidence of repeated contests of the cause of the disability such as occurred in Beissel, the employer must be permitted to seek relief. This rule promotes the early payment to injured employees which is clearly contemplated by the Act while it preserves the legitimate expectation that an employer\u2019s liability under the Act for work-related injuries not become a general disability insurance policy.\nThe order of Commonwealth Court is reversed and the record is remanded to that Court for review of issues not previously disposed of on appeal. We relinquish jurisdiction.\nReversed and remanded.\nLARSEN, J., files a dissenting opinion in which NIX, C.J., joins.\n. Since we granted the petition for allowance of appeal, J & L filed a petition for reorganization pursuant to Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, and by letter dated October 3, 1986, requested this Com\u00ed to stay this matter pending resolution of the bankruptcy proceeding. In light of the substitution of Safeco Insurance Co. as appellant in this matter, we decline to rule on J & L\u2019s request.\n. The record is not clear as to the exact date of the occurrence, indicating both July 18, 1977 and July 20, 1977, as the date of claimant\u2019s injury.\n. The Act provides in pertinent part:\nA referee designated by the department may, at any time, modify, reinstate, suspend, or terminate a notice of compensation payable ... upon petition filed by either party with the department, upon proof that the disability of an injured employe has increased, decreased, recurred, or has temporarily or finally ceased, or that the status of any dependent has changed____\n77 P.S. \u00a7 772 (Supp.1986).\n. The referee concluded that J & L was precluded from challenging the propriety of benefits paid prior to the date of its review petition.\n. The Act provides in pertinent part:\nThe employer and insurer shall promptly investigate each injury reported or known to the employer and shall proceed promptly to commence the payment of compensation due either pursuant to an agreement upon the compensation payable or a notice of compensation payable____ The first installment of compensation shall be paid not later than the twenty-first day after the employer has notice or knowledge of the employe\u2019s disability____\n77 P.S. \u00a7 717.1 (Supp.1986).\n. Claimant has not received worker\u2019s compensation benefits since November 19, 1980 when the referee granted J & L\u2019s request for a supersedeas pending resolution of the review petition. After his successful appeal to Commonwealth Court, claimant filed, in this Court, a petition for special relief, requesting reinstatement of his worker\u2019s compensation benefits. In view of our disposition of this matter, claimant\u2019s petition for special relief is denied."}
