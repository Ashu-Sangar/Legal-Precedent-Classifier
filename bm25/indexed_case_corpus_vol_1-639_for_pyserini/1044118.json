{"id": "1044118", "contents": "Judgment was entered in the Supreme Court,\nPer Curiam.\nBy the 28th section of the Poor Law of June 13th 1876, the father and grandfather, and the mother and grandmother, and the children and grandchildren of every poor person not able to work, shall, at their own charge, being of sufficient ability, relieve and maintain such poor person, at such rate as the Court of Quarter Sessions of the proper county shall order and direct. Maintenance of a father or mother unable to work is, therefore, a legal liability. When we add to this the feelings of natural affection and the desire produced by these feelings to provide for the comforts of parents, the right to effect an insurance on the life of the parent, to carry out these purposes, ought not to be denied. It would be technical in the extreme to say that a son has no insurable interest in his father\u2019s. life. Poverty may overtake the father in his lifetime, and thus both father and mother be cast upon the son; or if the father die before her, the necessity may fall at once upon the son. Why then should he not be permitted to make a provision, by insurance, to reimburse himself for his outlays, past or future ? What injury is done to the insurance company ? They receive the full premium, and they know in such case, from the very relationship of the parties, that the contract is not a mere gambling adventure, but is founded in the best feelings of our nature, and on a legal duty which may arise at any time. We are of opinion that the policy is not void.\nJudgment affirmed."}
