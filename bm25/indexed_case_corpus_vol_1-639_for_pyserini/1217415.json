Dellone and Mary Dellone \u201cjointly, with the right of survivorship\u201d for $100 a share; as part of the transaction, they agreed not to sell or transfer the stock \u201c. . . without first offering the same to . . . C. J. Delone, his heirs or assigns, at the same price of $100.00 per share paid for by them ...\u201d The seller guaranteed them an annual return of 5% on the investment and they agreed that \u201c. . . over and above five per cent.
