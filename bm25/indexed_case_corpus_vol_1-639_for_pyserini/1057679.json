{"id": "1057679", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Justice Moschzisker,\nPlaintiff, Robert Edmund Ralston, claimed damages, alleged to have been suffered by bim through injuries to his wife, due to the negligence of defendant company; he recovered a verdict for $2,000, upon which judgment was entered in his favor; defendant has appealed and asks judgment n. o. v.\nA formal release, bearing the admitted signatures of both plaintiff and his wife, was proved; but he contended it was procured by fraud. The issue as to the alleged fraud was submitted to the jury and found against defendant; the question for determination concerns the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict.\nWe shall state the case according to plaintiff\u2019s version ; but, at the same time, we note that, so far as the procurement of the release is concerned, most of the facts asserted by him are flatly denied by defendant.\nMrs. Ralston was injured, while a passenger upon one of defendant\u2019s trolley cars; the following morning, her husband informed the transit company of the accident; a few hours later, one of the defendant\u2019s claim agents called at the Ralston residence, and, in the presence of plaintiff, took a written'' statement from his wife, in which a claim was made against defendant \u201cfor the sum of $25,\u201d to cover damages suffered by reason of the accident; when upon the stand, plaintiff more than once denied any such claim had been made, asserting he was \u201cpositive about that,\u201d also saying he was \u201cpositive\u201d the subject of a settlement was not even discussed at the time in question, or until the third visit of defendant\u2019s agent. He likewise emphatically denied that his wife had signed any statement whatever concerning the accident; but, when shown the waiting to which we refer, containing his own signature as a witness, he retracted his former testimony, with the excuse that the matter had been so long ago he could not remember. At no time, however, did plaintiff allege any irregularity in connection with the procurement of this written statement, which is of importance, for it inaugurated negotiations that culminated in the signing of the release, here attacked; also, it indicates the amount finally paid closely approximates that originally claimed.\nTo set aside the release, plaintiff presented merely the testimony of himself and wife; and that given by the latter differs in several material respects from plaintiff\u2019s own version \u2014 both as to the preliminary negotiations leading up to final settlement and what actually occurred at the execution of the release. It is not necessary to state in detail these differences, for the fact that they exist is the material circumstance to which we wish to call attention.\nIt appears plaintiff knew that the man, who procured the release, was a representative of defendant company, and that he cabled for the very purpose of negotiating a settlement. Subsequent testimony shows several other visits by defendant\u2019s agent, culminating in the payment seven days after the accident of $20 \u2014 an amount midway between $15, originally offered by defendant, and $25, first claimed by plaintiff.\nThe release was executed by both Ralston and his wife, in the presence of defendant\u2019s agent, and another, entirely disinterested, subscribing witness. The latter was not produced at trial, it being testified on plaintiff\u2019s behalf that she was dead; although it appears, by an affidavit since filed, that such testimony is either false or mistaken, for the witness is still alive. This matter is discussed at length in our opinion disposing of the appeal in the case of Carrie Ralston, and need not be further referred to here.\nRalston and his wife both testified they executed the release without reading it, and in ignorance of its contents. So far as plaintiff is concerned, his only excuse for not reading or otherwise informing himself as to the contents of the paper, is that Ms wife was crying at the time he put Ms signature thereto, and, when he asked defendant\u2019s agent, \u201cWhat is on this paper?\u201d the latter \u201cflew up like a wild tiger, just as much as to say 'What do you ask me that for, what do you think I am?\u2019 \u201d Then, plaintiff said, \u201cI simply signed it.\u201d After this, he was asked, \u201cDid you read it before you signed it?\u201d to which he replied \u201cNo, sir, he wouldn\u2019t let me.\u201d Plaintiff does not attempt to say what means, if any, were taken to prevent Mm from reading or informing himself as to the contents of the paper; so Ms mere assertion, that the agent \u201cwouldn\u2019t let\u201d him read it, can only be referred to the prior vague statement to the effect that, when he (plaintiff) asked about the contents of the paper, the agent flew up \u201clike a wild tiger.\u201d\nThe testimony which we have already recited \u2014 together with allegations that the paper was folded in such a way plaintiff could not observe its contents, that the agent told him it was a \u201creceipt\u201d for money paid to date, and he would return later and make other payments, to culminate in a final settlement \u2014 constitutes the evidence relied upon to set aside a somewhat lengthy, formally drawn, sealed release of damages, admittedly signed by a thoroughly literate and mentally capable man of affairs, after negotiations with one whom he knew to be an adjuster of claims representing the defendant company.\nEach of the following cases, in one respect or another, is relevant to the one in hand; and, when considered together, as a line of authorities, the principles here applicable will appear therefrom.\nPa. R. R. Co. v. Shay, 82 Pa. 198: Plaintiff, who signed a release, said he could neither read nor write; but execution of the paper was not denied. He did not know contents of instrument, understood it to be simply a receipt for expenses, and did not intend to release damages when he put his name thereto. While the representative of defendant told plaintiff it was a receipt (as it was), it also was a release, which, he did not tell plaintiff. The case was submitted to the jury, to find whether the release had been \u201cobtained by fraud.\u201d We said there was no evidence to justify submission, and, applying the rule laid down by Justice Gibson in Greenfield\u2019s Est., 14 Pa. 489, 496 \u2014 \u201cIf a party who can read will not read a deed put before him for execution...... he is guilty of supine negligence, which......is not the subject of protection either in equity or law\u201d \u2014 we reversed a judgment for plaintiff. This authority is followed in many later cases, and is cited as late as O\u2019Reilly v. Reading Trust Co., 262 Pa. 337, 343.\nSeeley v. Citizen\u2019s Traction Co., 179 Pa. 334: Plaintiff, a woman, released damages, for $25, six days after the accident; she testified that she did not \u201ccomprehend the nature of the writing.\u201d The trial court instructed for defendant, and we affirmed a judgment in its favor. No evidence of \u201ctrickery or fraud\u201d appears; but the case is important here because we there recognize (p. 338), as a relevant consideration in passing upon the validity of the release, the fact that plaintiff was a person of \u201cintelligence and fair education\u201d \u2014 as is the present plaintiff.\nBruns v. Union Traction Co., 185 Pa. 533: Plaintiff\u2019s husband was hurt at his work, August 9th, and died, as the result thereof, August 15th; the day before his death, he executed a release, upon payment of $40. The evidence tended to show the paper was signed when deceased was \u201cmentally competent,\u201d and after he had \u201cbargained\u201d with the representative of defendant company; the fact of this prior bargaining was taken into consideration in affirming judgment on a directed verdict for defendant, as it must be in the case now before us.\nKane v. Chester Traction Co., 186 Pa. 145: Plaintiff, a woman, signed a release; she claimed it was obtained through fraudulent representations by defendant\u2019s agent, who told her the local judge was a stockholder in defendant company, and, therefore, she had no chance to win a suit at law. We said, assuming as a fact that such false statement was made, there was no \u201cclear testimony\u201d that it induced the execution of the release; and stated (p. 150) the \u201cflimsy nature\u201d of the alleged misrepresentations was such as not to affect the judgment of a person of \u201ccommon sense.\u201d We also said \u201cthe fact that the injuries proved greater than they looked to be at the time of the release is not to be considered at all,\u201d citing Seeley v. Citizens Traction Co., 179 Pa. 334. Judgment for defendant was affirmed. Here again the apparent \u201ccommon sense,\u201d or intellectual capacity, of the person who signed the release is taken into account in passing upon the evidence as to its validity.\nIn DeDouglas v. Union Traction Co., 198 Pa. 430, binding instructions were given for defendant, and judgment in its favor affirmed. Plaintiff, a woman, signed a release, a few days after the accident, on payment of $50. She testified that an agent of defendant company called on her, paid the money, and asked for a receipt; whereupon she put her name to a paper which he produced. We held the proofs insufficient to overcome the release, saying: When evidence to set aside a release is not \u201cclear, precise and indubitable,\u201d the issue \u201cshould be withdrawn from the jury.\u201d This is an authority that, in such eases, it is the right and duty of the court to judge as to the sufficiency, in quality, of evidence to go to the jury, on a question of alleged fraud in the procurement of a release.\nOgden v. Phila. & West Chester Traction Co., 202 Pa. 480: Plaintiff signed a release, and afterward set up an oral agreement, made at same time (by way of inducement), which entitled him to compensation beyond that given under the release. A judgment on the verdict for plaintiff was reversed. We held (p. 485) that the evidence was not \u201cclear, precise and indubitable,\u201d and the trial judge, \u201cas chancellor,\u201d should have so declared (p. 486); that the evidence was not sufficient to \u201cwarrant the destruction of a written instrument\u201d; and, applying the rule in Pa. R. R. Co. v. Shay, 82 Pa. 198, in that regard, stated (p. 487) : \u201cWhere a chancellor could not reform a written instrument......because of the doubtfulness of the parol evidence to set it aside...... he should not permit twelve chancellors in a jury box to nullify it.\u201d\nLaird v. Union Traction Co., 208 Pa. 574: Plaintiff executed a release, on payment to him of $150, the day after the accident; a judgment for defendant, following binding instructions in its favor, was affirmed. Plaintiff claimed he was unconscious from his injuries, when the release was signed. We said, \u201cTo set aside a written instrument, the evidence must be clear, precise and indubitable, whether the allegation be fraud practiced by the beneficiary under it [i. e. the person to whom the release is given] or incapacity by him who executed it\u201d; and added, there was no evidence of fraudulent representation or undue persuasion when the release was executed, but there was \u201csome slight evidence on part of plaintiff that he was in a state of unconsciousness\u201d at that time. The case is treated as though there were no evidence of fraud present; and this apparently because of the insufficiency of the testimony as to plaintiff\u2019s unconsciousness ; for, if plaintiff were really in a state of unconsciousness, when the release was taken from him, and defendant knew it, the obtaining of the paper under such cii\u2019cumstances would, in itself, be a fraud. This authority is valuable here, for it clearly rules that tbe trial judge, in such cases, acts as a chancellor in passing on the legal sufficiency of the proofs (pp. 576-7) \u2014 as to Avhether or not they measure up to the standard required \u2014 and, if he considers the evidence not of a quality to be reasonably found \u201cindubitable,\u201d he should not submit it to the jury.\nHicks v. Harbison-Walker Co., 212 Pa. 437: Plaintiff, Avho signed a release, on payment of $25, claimed the person who obtained his signature thereto \u201cmisrepresented it as a receipt for money donated to him\u201d; he could not read, and did not ask to have the paper read. We considered plaintiff\u2019s \u201cmental capacity\u201d; and, noting that bis story was uncorroborated, applied tbe rule from Greenfield\u2019s Estate, 14 Pa. 489. Judgment on binding instructions for defendant was affirmed.\nSpritzer v. Pa. R. R. Co., 226 Pa. 166: Damages were released, for $200. Plaintiff claimed be \u201cwas not in mental condition to appreciate wbat be was doing\u201d at tbe time tbe release was signed. Judgment on a verdict for plaintiff was reversed. This court said (p. 168) : \u201cStarting with tbe presumption in favor of tbe release, tbe burden was on plaintiff to show conditions wbicb would avoid it in law.\u201d We then note that, \u201cwhen tbe attempt is not to alter but to overthrow a release,\u201d one witness is sufficient; adding, however, that, plaintiff having failed to prove be did not know wbat be was doing, tbe release must prevail. In tbe course of our consideration of tbe law, we state (p. 173) : \u201cNothing short of evidence precise, clear and indubitable can be allowed to overcome a written instrument; when it does not come up to this measure, tbe case should be withdrawn from tbe jury.\u201d\nBaranski v. Wilmsen, 56 Pa. Superior Ct. 153 (Rice, P. J.): Plaintiff signed a release written in English; judgment in bis favor was reversed, because there was no sufficient evidence to justify tbe \u201cspecial finding\u201d of tbe jury that defendant procured plaintiff to sign by \u201cfraud\u201d (p. 158). Baranski was a foreigner, who could neither read nor write English, but tbe negotiations, leading to tbe release, were carried on in a language be understood. Tbe paper was executed three weeks after tbe accident, when tbe injured man was mentally capable. Plaintiff did not ask to have tbe paper read to him; although be requested an interpreter be provided, wbicb was declined (p. 160). While Baranski was not told tbe document was not a release, neither was be informed it was of that character. Tbe Superior Court applied tbe rule laid down in Pa. R. R. Co. v. Shay, 82 Pa. 198, saying (p. 161) : \u201cIf one who can, will not read a paper put before him for execution, he is guilty of supine negligence,\u201d which \u201cis not the subject of protection either in equity or at law,\u201d adding, \u201cnothing short of evidence precise, clear and indubitable can be allowed to overcome a written instrument,\u201d and, when the proofs do not measure up to this standard, \u201cthe case should be withdrawn from the jury.\u201d\nWhile all said in the case last cited is not adopted, it is important for the definition we are about to give, and its application by Judge Bice. \u201cWhen the terms clear, precise and indubitable, are used, in defining the requisite proof of a particular fact to be made out by oral testimony, it is meant that it shall be found that the witnesses are credible, that they distinctly remember the facts to which they testify, that they narrate the details exactly, and that their statements are true.\u201d After this definition (which is approved by us in Lindemann v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., 251 Pa. 489, 492, 494, infra), President Judge Bice states that, since plaintiff gave several discrepant versions, concerning the circumstances relating to the execution of the paper in controversy, doubt was cast upon the \u201cdistinctness of his recollection and the exactness of his statements\u201d; therefore his evidence could not be considered \u201cclear, precise and indubitable.\u201d For instant application of the rule under discussion, see next to final paragraph of this opinion.\nThe line of cases just reviewed furnishes ample authority for holding, as we do, that, under the evidence at bar, plaintiff\u2019s claim should have been withdrawn from the jury by binding instructions for defendant.\nWhere a writing is executed by reason of misrepresentations as to its contents, the instrument is not the deed of the party who signed it (Green v. North Buffalo Township, 56 Pa. 110, 114); but, in order to set aside a solemn written instrument on this principle, the facts alleged for that purpose must be \u201cdefinitely and distinctly established\u201d: Burt v. Burt, 221 Pa. 171, 174. Of course, whether the evidence is true is a question of fact (Pusic v. Salak, 261 Pa. 512, 519), but whether it meets the required standard which justifies its submission to the jury (to pass upon its truth) is always a question of law; and, as we have seen from numerous authorities here cited, some of the qualities required of evidence, to set aside a written instrument on the ground of fraud in its procurement, are that the witnesses depended upon for that purpose shall \u201cdistinctly remember the facts to which they testify\u201d and \u201cnarrate the details exactly\u201d: Lindemann v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., 251 Pa. 489; Baranski v. Wilmsen, 56 Pa. Superior Ct. 153, supra.\nHere, the transcript of plaintiff\u2019s evidence shows that he either deliberately falsified certain material facts or (in the words of Judge Rice in the case last cited) that he cast serious doubts upon \u201cthe distinctness of his recollection and the exactness of his statements.\u201d Under these circumstances, the evidence was not of the standard required to justify its submission to the jury as sufficient warrant for setting aside a solemn written instrument. As said by Mr. Justice Green, in Wojciechowski v. Spreckels\u2019 S. R. Co., 177 Pa. 57, 65, \u201cNo man\u2019s deed for the house he lives in would be safe if it could be destroyed by such testimony as this\u201d; and we may add that all future efforts to compromise damage claims might well be abandoned if formal releases can thus easily be set aside.\nTo say the least, the testimony relied upon by plaintiff, to sustain his allegation of fraudulent procurement of the release, plainly shows either a confusion in Ms mind as to the real facts leading to the execution of the instrument or, if not that, then it discloses the case of a man, mentally capable and with business experience, dealing with another, whose character \u2014 as the representative of one against whom he had a claim \u2014 was fully known to him, and with whom for several days he had been in negotiation for settlement, signing a release (which he had an opportunity to read, had he seen fit to take advantage of it), upon payment of an amount midway between tbe sum originally claimed by Mm and that originally offered by defendant. Looking at the matter from the first aspect, the evidence was not up to the standard required by law to accomplish the end in vieiv, and, from the other, it presents a case of what Mr. Justice Shakswood, in Pa. R. R. Co. v. Shay, 82 Pa. 198, 203 (quoting Chief Justice Gibson), designates as \u201csupine negligence\u201d; which, he correctly adds, is \u201cnot the subject of protection, either in equity or at law.\u201d\nThe following cases, relied upon by plaintiff, where releases have been set aside, are all distinguishable from the one at bar; but, as will be observed, even some of these fully recognize the principles which we have applied in determining that defendant is entitled to judgment in its favor.\nEttinger v. Jones, 139 Pa. 218, is one of those cases which must be confined to its own peculiar facts. A woman, whom defendant had got into trouble and promised to marry, signed a release, at his urgent solicitation, when she was under great mental stress; the only consideration was that imparted by the seal upon the instrument, and a renewal of the promise to marry when defendant got out of trouble with another woman. In affirming judgment for plaintiff, we held the release, obtained by \u201ctrick and fraud,\u201d was void.\nGibson v. W. N. Y. & Pa. R. R. Co., 164 Pa. 142, is a case where plaintiff proved that, when his name was put upon the release, he was mentally incapable, from the effects of anaesthetics administered a short time before. Apparently, it was not alleged defendant either knew of \u25a0\u2022jr took advantage of plaintiff\u2019s weakened mental state, the sole contention being that, owing to his lack of mind, no contract existed. In deciding this issue was for the jury, we said (p. 149) : \u201cWhere a fraud......in the creation of the instrument, is the defense, it is a purely equitable one and equitable rules will be enforced as to the measure of proof to sustain it, but where the defense rests on the existence of a fact involving no element of. fraud, the evidence is for the jury, under the common law rules of evidence.\u201d\nJulius v. P., A. & M. Traction Co., 184 Pa. 19, is much like the case just reviewed.\nClayton v. Consolidated Traction Co., 204 Pa. 536: Plaintiff, a woman, signed a release, upon payment of $5, ten days after the accident; she afterwards claimed it was procured by fraud. Judgment on a verdict against defendant was affirmed. Plaintiff testified a man called at her house, claiming he was a friend of the car conductor who had caused the accident, and said he had come to see her in regard to getting the former reinstated in his position. At a second interview, this man inquired how much expense she had been put to, and, when told $5, gave her the amount, asking for a receipt. He produced a paper, folded in such way plaintiff could not read it; neither did he read it to her, but designated the place where he desired her to sign. Plaintiff did not know the man was a representative of the company. This testimony was fully corroborated by a disinterested witness. We said (p. 541) that defendant\u2019s agent not only misrepresented the true character of the release, but \u201cprevented\u201d its contents from being known, and this, taken with the other circumstances in the case, constituted such fraud as to avoid the instrument. However, we there expressly recognize the authority of Pa. R. R. Co. v. Shay, 82 Pa. 198; and DeDouglas v. Union Traction Co., 198 Pa. 430, but distinguish them on their facts; we also recognize the authority of Greenfield\u2019s Estate, 14 Pa. 489, and, in this connection, state that the mere circumstance of the release not being read to plaintiff would not convict defendant of fraud in procuring it; finally, we direct attention to the fact that the man who called upon plaintiff did not introduce himself as a representative of defendant or, in any sense, negotiate for a settlement of her claim against the traction company. These facts, \u25a0with other apparent differences, distinguish the case from the one now on appeal.\nIn McCaw v. Union Traction Co., 205 Pa. 271, while a release was set aside, on ground of fraud in its procurement, the report fails to show the character of the evidence, except that plaintiff claimed he was unconscious when the paper was alleged to have been executed by him. The only assignment concerns critical comments by the trial judge on the release. The case is not enlightening.\nGordon v. Great A. & P. Tea Co., 243 Pa. 330: Plaintiff signed a release, which he claimed was procured by fraud. Judgment, entered on a verdict for plaintiff, was affirmed. A payment of $150 had been made at the time the release was signed; but plaintiff presented evidence to show he was then in an enfeebled mental condition, as the result of a \u201chead operation,\u201d necessitated by the accident; that the representative of defendant informed him the '$150 was a gratuity from his employers, \u201cto put\u201d him over the holidays, and the word \u201crelease\u201d was not mentioned; that a document was placed before him with only the signature line exposed; and he was hurried in the execution of the paper, which the representative of the company stated was merely a receipt. We said (p. 335) the evidence was sufficient to justify the plea that plaintiff\u2019s mind \u201cwas so enfeebled at the time he signed the paper he could readily have been made a dupe of designing persons,\u201d and this, together with the other evidence in the case, was ample to sustain a finding that he was deceived and defrauded into the execution of the alleged release, adding, \u201cthe fact that plaintiff did not read or require the paper to be read to him\u201d could not (under the peculiar circumstances) be given binding effect, for he had not been afforded a \u201cfair opportunity for examination\u201d thereof, and had been deceived as to its contents. We there note the distinction between cases where the effort is to \u201creform\u201d and those in which the attempt is to \u201cset aside\u201d written instruments; also, in the latter class of cases, the difference between those where either the \u201celement of frand or mental enfeeblement\u201d appears, and instances where snch elements are lacking. Here, in the pending case, the effort is to set aside the release, and, while frand in its procurement is alleged, the evidence depended upon to prove that element fell short of the legal standard required for the purpose, as already shown in our review thereof, and as we shall hereinafter briefly discuss. The facts at bar and those in the last cited case differ in many apparent respects.\nLindemann v. Pittsburgh Rys. Co., 251 Pa. 489: Plaintiff signed a release, upon payment to him of $50. At trial, there was ample evidence, \u2014 both lay and expert,\u2014 to sustain plaintiff\u2019s contention that the release had been executed when he was mentally incapable; and the issue was decided accordingly. All that is said in the opinion of the court below, affirming judgment on the verdict (adopted per curiam) must be read with the peculiar facts of the case in mind. This definition, relevant here, is there approved: \u201cIndubitable proof is evidence that is not only found to be credible, but of such weight and directness as to make out the facts alleged beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d\nIn Hogarth v. Grundy, 256 Pa. 451, it was alleged plaintiff signed a release, on payment of $200. Plaintiff admitted some money was given him by his employers; but said it was at a time when he was suffering intensely from the effects of an amputated arm. The agent of defendant, who called to get the release, did not make known to plaintiff who he was, and the latter did not know him; he told the injured man that he was going to give him a \u201clittle money,\u201d as a \u201cpresent\u201d from his employers, \u201cto help Aim out on expenses.\u201d Plaintiff had no recollection of signing the release, \u2014 which contained only his mark \u2014 or any other paper, and he denied that the man, who brought the money, said anything about a settlement of his claim against defendant. He was corroborated by his wife. We affirmed judgment for plaintiff; but, as may be seen, the case is readily distinguishable from the one before us.\nVanormer v. Osborn Machine Co., 255 Pa. 47: Plaintiff signed a release in consideration of $1,150, and subsequently claimed it was obtained by fraud. He testified the agent of the company, which insured defendant, got his signature by pretending to have a telephone conversation with his, plaintiff\u2019s, doctor, an eminent eye-specialist, \u201cin which the agent quoted the doctor,\u201d who had just examined plaintiff, as saying the latter\u2019s right eye, \u201cwould come out all right, and he would soon be able to resume his work.\u201d The injured man, relying on the information thus conveyed to him, as to his physical prospects for the future, signed the release; whereas the pretended conversation was an absolute falsehood, and plaintiff soon afterwards lost the sight of his eye. We sustained a judgment entered on a verdict against defendant; for the evidence was ample in every way to show a direct case of fraud in the procurement of the release.\nWe have reviewed the cases cited to us by counsel on both sides, and believe they comprehend all recent rulings on the subject in hand; we shall now refer to the latest relevant authority. In Palkovitz v. American Sheet & Tin Plate Co., 266 Pa. 176, 181, plaintiff, an ignorant foreigner, who did not understand our language, signed a release, typed in English. On appeal, affirming judgment in his favor, we said that, since defendant\u2019s own, principal, witness had proved the alleged release to have been procured under such circumstances as to destroy entirely its effectiveness, it was \u201cnot in a position successfully to maintain plaintiff had failed to produce sufficient evidence to that end.\u201d While the statement just quoted is sufficient to distinguish the case from the one now before us, yet another distinguishing point between the two is the illiteracy of Palkovitz, as compared with the plaintiff at bar, who is a man of fair English education, a bookkeeper by profession, engaged, at a salary of $3,000 a year, as an auditor of accounts, which work had trained him to be \u201caccurate and careful,\u201d as he admitted on the stand.\nOf course, every slight departure or variation in testimony, depended upon to set aside a written instrument on the ground of fraud, will not condemn the proofs as insufficient; but, in the present instance, as already pointed out, the evidence clearly fails to measure up to the required legal standard, which, as hereinbefore shown, is that in such cases the proofs must be clear, precise and indubitable. The first mentioned requirements mean that the witnesses must be credible, distinctly remember the facts to which they testify and narrate the details exactly (Lindemann v. Pittsburgh Eys. Co., supra); and, to the extent we are at present concerned with the last requirement \u2014 that the statement of the witnesses must be indubitable, or true (that is, so far as we are concerned with its application to the preliminary consideration of the evidence by the court, to judge of its sufficiency to go to the jury) \u2014 it simply means that, disregarding counter-attacks on plaintiff\u2019s proofs, they must have the appearance of truth, at least to the extent of being free from manifest inconsistencies, or marks of inherent unreliability. Unfortunately for plaintiff, this cannot be said of the testimony upon which he depends, and the court below erred in law when it refused so to hold.\nThe assignments of error are sustained, the judgment in favor of plaintiff, Robert Edmund Ralston, is reversed, and, so far as his claim is concerned, judgment is here entered for defendant."}
