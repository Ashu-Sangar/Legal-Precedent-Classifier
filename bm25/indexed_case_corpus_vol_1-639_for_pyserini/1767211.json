{"id": "1767211", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nBased on ample evidence of record, the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County, Orphans\u2019 Court Division, agreed with appellee Cumberland County Children\u2019s Services that, from February 7, 1977, to November 9, 1977, a period in excess of nine months, appellant L.L.D. maintained absolutely no contacts with his two sons, B.M.D. and R.L.D. Pursuant to section 311(1) of the Adoption Act of 1970, Act of July 24,1970, P.L. 620,1 P.S. \u00a7 311(1) (Supp.1980), which authorizes termination of parental rights where a parent \u201cfor a period of at least six months . .. has refused or failed to perform parental duties ...,\u201d the orphans\u2019 court entered a final decree terminating appellant\u2019s rights. This appeal followed.\nAppellant does not dispute the orphans\u2019 court determination that appellant maintained no contacts with his sons. Indeed, this determination of fact, supported by the record, may not be disturbed. See e. g., Hamill Estate, 487 Pa. 592, 410 A.2d 770 (1980); In re C.A.W., 487 Pa. 163, 409 A.2d 16 (1979); In re William L., 477 Pa. 322, 383 A.2d 1228, cert. denied, 439 U.S. 880, 99 S.Ct. 216, 58 L.Ed.2d 192 (1978); Cohen Will, 445 Pa. 549, 550, 284 A.2d 754, 755 (1971).\nWhat appellant does dispute is the orphans\u2019 court conclusion that termination is appropriate even though, in appellant\u2019s view, appellee did not make appellant sufficiently aware of the consequences of his failure to perform parental duties. In In re I. L. G., 492 Pa.-, 424 A.2d 1306 (J. 326 of 1980, filed 1981), we considered substantially the same claim. There, despite its finding that the natural parent refused or failed to perform parental duties for a period in excess of the statutory six month period, the orphans\u2019 court refused to terminate parental rights because a children\u2019s services agency failed to \u201cinform [the parent] of the possible consequences of ... failure to perform . .. parental duties.\u201d Relying upon the traditional and fundamental principle that \u201cthe parental obligation is a positive duty which requires affirmative performance,\u201d In re Burns, 474 Pa. 615, 624, 379 A.2d 535, 540 (1977), (see also In re Adoption of Orwick, 464 Pa. 549, 347 A.2d 677 (1976); In re Adoption of Mehlon Nichelle McCray, 460 Pa. 210, 331 A.2d 652 (1975); Appeal of Diane B., 456 Pa. 429, 321 A.2d 618 (1974); In re Smith\u2019s Adoption, 412 Pa. 501, 194 A.2d 919 (1963)), this Court concluded that neither the Adoption Act nor our cases support a refusal to terminate on this ground.\n\u201cOur courts are without authority to engraft upon the Adoption Act a provision conditioning a parent\u2019s obligation to perform affirmative parental duties only upon \u2018warning\u2019 by a children services agency. This the Legislature did not do and we may not intrude into this exclusive province of legislative judgment. As Justice Holmes observed in Missouri, Kansas and Texas Railway Company v. May, 194 U.S. 267, 270, 24 S.Ct. 638, 639 (1904), \u2018legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts.\u2019 \u201d\nIn re I. L. G., 492 Pa. 507, 424 A.2d 1306. As in I. L. G., appellant\u2019s contention that termination is improper must be rejected.\nDecree affirmed. Each party pay own costs.\nNIX, J., files a dissenting opinion.\nAppellant, fully represented by counsel at the hearing on appellee\u2019s termination petition, also disputes the refusal of the orphans\u2019 court to continue the proceedings a third time so that appellant could personally appear. Appellant cites nothing in the Adoption Act or our cases which mandates the presence of the parent whose rights are the subject of a termination petition. Thus whether a continuance should be granted is for the discretion of the orphans\u2019 court. See 4 Std.Pa.Prac. Ch. 19 (Continuances), \u00a7 4 at pp. 617-18 (1955) (citing cases). This record, reflecting two previous continuances to accommodate appellant, reveals no abuse of discretion. Indeed, the court held the record open fifteen days after its hearing to permit appellant an opportunity to substantiate the need for an additional continuance. No such substantiation was presented."}
