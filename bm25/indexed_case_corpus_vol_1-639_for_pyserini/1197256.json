{"id": "1197256", "contents": "Per Curiam,\nThis appeal is, from a decree restraining defendant from trading under the name \u201cGreat Northern. Metal Co.\u201d or any other name deceptively similar to plaintiff\u2019s trade name \u201cNorthern Metal Company\u201d. The evidence supports the findings of fact made by the learned chancellor, approved by the court in banc; the decree must therefore be affirmed. See, generally, Geffen v. Baltimore Markets, Inc., 325 Pa. 509, at page 515, 191 A. 24; Restatement, Torts, sections 716, 717, 727 et seq. Costs to be paid by appellant."}
