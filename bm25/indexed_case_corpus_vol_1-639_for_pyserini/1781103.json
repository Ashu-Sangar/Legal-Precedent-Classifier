{"id": "1781103", "contents": "OPINION OF THE COURT\nROBERTS, Justice.\nAppellant Richard Canady appeals from judgments of sentence imposed by the court upon a jury\u2019s verdicts of guilty of murder of the second degree and involuntary deviate sexual intercourse. Appellant seeks a new trial on the basis of several claims of evidentiary and trial error. We reject appellant\u2019s contentions and affirm.\nAppellant\u2019s first contention \u2014 that an inculpatory statement which he made to police on January 18, 1977, was the product of an arrest made without probable cause and hence inadmissible \u2014 is not substantiated by the record. At the time of appellant\u2019s arrest, police had found the body of the victim, a sixteen year-old boy, who had disappeared on December 25, 1976. The body bore marks of sexual abuse. From investigation, which included interviews with appellant and the victim\u2019s family, police knew that appellant and the victim had been together during the evening of the victim\u2019s disappearance and had been last seen together at midnight. Members of the victim\u2019s family had informed police that appellant had called them several times to inquire concerning the victim\u2019s whereabouts. In addition, the victim\u2019s cousin had told police of an unsuccessful sexual advance that appellant had once made toward the victim. This evidence, together with the fact that police knew that appellant had twice previously been convicted for sexually-related assaults on teenage boys, amply supports the suppression court\u2019s finding of probable cause.\nAppellant\u2019s second claim of error relates to a confession signed by appellant and introduced by the Commonwealth at trial. Appellant alleges that he never made the inculpatory statements contained in the confession, but that he signed the confession because of police coercion. At the hearing on appellant\u2019s suppression motion, appellant testified that he had been severely beaten and had sustained a cut above his eye during his interrogation. Appellant also presented testimony that while in custody after his arrest he had related the same claim to a public defender, his brother and a member of the staff of a police abuse project. The court discredited appellant\u2019s evidence and chose, instead, to credit testimony by police that appellant\u2019s injuries had been self-inflicted. The court thus concluded that the Commonwealth had met its burden of establishing the voluntariness of appellant\u2019s confession by a preponderance of the evidence. See Lego v. Twomey, 404 U.S. 477, 92 S.Ct. 619, 30 L.Ed.2d 618 (1972).\nIn reviewing a suppression court\u2019s determination in favor of the Commonwealth, this Court accepts \u201conly the evidence of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses and so much of the evidence for the defense as fairly read in the context of the record as a whole remains uncontradicted.\u201d Commonwealth v. Brown, 473 Pa. 562, 566, 375 A.2d 1260, 1262 (1977). Under this standard, the suppression court\u2019s decision must be sustained.\nIn his third claim of error, appellant contends that the prosecutor improperly suggested that appellant had been convicted of a prior crime by asking whether the reason that he had been a patient in a mental institution was because he had been \u201ca sexual offender.\u201d Appellant\u2019s confession, which was admitted into evidence before the jury, graphically described appellant\u2019s prior sexual relationships with younger boys. We are satisfied that the prosecutor\u2019s passing reference, which did not refer to any specific incident or criminal conviction, cannot form a basis for relief. See Commonwealth v. Story, 476 Pa. 391, 410, 383 A.2d 155, 164 (1978).\nAppellant\u2019s fourth claim of error challenges the trial court\u2019s refusal to declare a mistrial when the prosecutor asked appellant if he was a homosexual. As appellant\u2019s confession, in which appellant admitted homosexual activities, was already in evidence, this claim, too, must be rejected.\nBecause none of appellant\u2019s claims either individually or collectively merit relief, the judgments of sentence must be affirmed.\nJudgments of sentence affirmed.\n. Appellant was sentenced to consecutive terms of life imprisonment for murder of the second degree and five to ten years for involuntary deviate sexual intercourse.\n. In a related claim, appellant contends that he was subject to a prior illegal arrest on January 14, 1977. Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, the record establishes that appellant contacted police and voluntarily went to police headquarters, where, after receiving Miranda warnings, he made an exculpatory statement.\n. Judicial review, by either the suppression court or appellate courts, of claims such as appellant\u2019s often centers on a swearing contest between defendant and police. A number of commentators, including law enforcement officials, have advocated the tape recording of custodial interrogations as a procedure which would aid police investigations, protect police against frivolous claims of abuse, and make judicial review of the voluntariness of in-custody statements more meaningful.
