Ho fault is found with the items of this account.' They are not shown to be incorrect, nor is error assigned thereto except in the matter of interest. It is the result that is complained of.\nAs a mere cash account it is doubtless correct. It shows the expenditures and receipts. But when we examine it to ascertain what, if any, profits were made by the firm, we cannot adopt the master\u2019s conclusions. The item of $1,385.15, \u201camount paid for building expenses\u201d must be thrown out in estimating profits, for the plain reason that it was expended for betterments. It was evidently for the permanent improvement of the real estate. . The master does not give the items of this expenditure, but enough appears to show its general character. In one place he refers to it as \u201c the amount, expended for building.\u201d In another place he says : \u201c The mill was.not in a condition for successfully parrying .on the business, and considerable money was expended in improving it.\u201d Again the improvements were for \u201crepairing, improving and increasing the capacity and power of the mill.\u201d This is something outside of the ordinary repairs to a property of this description. The improvements were evidently of a permanent character, for the purpose of increasing the capacity of the mill. They added to the permanent value of the real estate, and must therefore be regarded as capital. The outlay was not a part of the annual current expense of carrying on the business. It was perhaps a necessary expenditure, but it was no more a part of. the expenses of the business than the purchase of the mill property itself.\nWe are of opinion that the appellant is entitled to his salary at the rate agreed upon up to April 1, 1877. This will leave no balance in the hands of the appellant to charge interest upon. We need not therefore discuss the fifth assignment. The costs wc will leave as the court below has placed them ; the costs of this appeal, however, must be paid by the appellees. ' It will be the duty of the court below to enter a decree in accordance with this opinion, or if necessary, to send the case back to the master for that purpose.\nThe decree is reversed at the costs of the appellees, and the record remitted to the court below with instructions to enter a decree in accordance with the foregoing."}
