{"id": "295718", "contents": "Opinion by\nMr. Chief Justice Moschzisker,\nHenry E. Shock died February 10, 1917; by his will, dated November 16, 1916, he divided part of his residuary estate into three portions, for the benefit of his three children during their respective lives, and conferred upon each of these children, namely, James E. Shoch, Nettie A. Shoch, and Bessie Clair Shoch Neel, a testamentary power of disposition over his or her particular portion, providing that, \u201cin default of such appointment, then the said part and proportion of the principal of my residuary estate from which said deceased child had been paid the income during his or her life shall be paid, transferred and conveyed unto such of my grandchildren who shall then [at the death of the child] be alive, absolutely and per stirpes.\u201d\nJames E. Shoch died January 7, 1918, leaving one child, a minor son, James E. Shoch, Jr., for whom Stephen J. Simon was subsequently appointed guardian.\nNettie A. Shoch was a single woman when her father made his will, and remains such. Bessie Clair Shoch Neel, the wife of Percy L. Neel, had three minor children at the date of her father\u2019s will, who still live, namely, Sara, Percy and Harry, of 'whom the Commonwealth Title & Trust Company is guardian.\nOn the adjudication of the account of the surviving executor of Henry E. Shoch, deceased, a controversy arose over the ownership of that share of the residuary estate from which his son, J ames E. Shoch, deceased, had received the income, and the Orphans\u2019 Court of Philadelphia County, passing on the meaning of decedent\u2019s will, construed the word \u201cgrandchildren,\u201d as used in the above-quoted devise, to mean only the children of the child who had power of appointment over the particular fund before the court. The property in question was awarded to the guardian of James E. Shoch, Jr., to the exclusion of the .Neel grandchildren, and the guardian of the latter has appealed.\nIn another opinion filed this day, on the appeal of Germaine S. Shoch Lentz, the widow of James R. Shoch, deceased (the preceding case), we held that her husband had died intestate, so far as-the interest of his son James R. Shoch, Jr., is concerned, and that the court below did not err in making the award to the latter\u2019s guardian; we there said, however, that the part of Henry R. Shoch\u2019s will above quoted, so far as the meaning of the word \u201cgrandchildren\u201d was involved, would be more particularly considered on the present appeal.\nAppellant contends that its three wards, the minor children of Bessie Glair Shoch Neel, should share with James R. Shoch, Jr., the portion of the estate from which the latter\u2019s father had drawn income during his life. In deciding otherwise, the court below said, inter alia: \u201cIt is elementary that a gift per stirpes is prima facie a gift to a group whose ancestor is dead, and they take in his right; this clause really means that the third should go to \u2018such of my grandchildren\u2019 as are the children of this stock, and, read in this way, we find an interpretation breathing equality, without the necessity of discarding some of the words used by testator.\u201d\nWe agree with the court below that Henry R. Shoch intended the children of each child of Ms, who might die intestate, to take their parent\u2019s share absolutely, and that he used the term \u201cper stirpes\u201d in the sense indicated by that tribunal.\nAnderson\u2019s Law Dictionary (p. 765) states \u201cper stirpes\u201d to mean \u201ctaking by representation \u2014 opposed to per capita\u201d; but, the Neel children could not take as representing their mother, for she is still alive. The only two cases cited on the subject in Words and Phrases (vol. 6,1st ed., 5286, and vol. 3, 2d ed., 955, respectively) sustain the meaning ascribed to per stirpes by the court below. Thus: \u201cWhen issue are said to take per stirpes it is meant that the descendants of a deceased person take the property to which he was entitled or would have been entitled if living,\u201d citing Rotmanskey v. Heiss, 39 Atl. 415, 86 Md. 633; and \u201cThe expression- \u2018per stirpes\u2019 means to take by stock or through a common source, and, when applied to estates, signifies that the particular descendants shall take among themselves the share of their deceased parent,\u201d citing Parrish v. Mills (Tex.), 102 S. W. 184, 188. Moreover, in the only two other portions of his will where Henry R. Shoch employs the phrase \u201cper stirpes,\u201d he uses it to convey the meaning that grandchildren shall represent their deceased ancestor; and, when this sense is given that phrase in the present portion of the will, it serves to maintain the scheme of equality of distribution between testator\u2019s three children which the document as a whole indicates testator desired.\nAppellant urges, against the construction we have adopted, that testator\u2019s daughter, Nettie, is single, and unless she marries and leaves issue, or exercises her power of appointment, this interpretation will produce an intestacy. The opinion of the court below, disposing of the contention just referred to, well says: \u201cWhile this is true [that an intestacy may result], it is the lesser of the evils presented, and we have authority for so holding. In 2 Jarman on Wills (6th Eng. ed.), 1714, it is said: \u2018Accordingly, where property is given to A, B and C for their lives, as tenants in common, and \u201cafter-wards,\u201d or \u201cat their death,\u201d it is given to their children in equal shares, this is generally construed to mean that \u201cat their deaths\u201d it is to go to their respective children; that is, the division is per stirpes.\u2019 In a footnote, Jar-man adds: \u2018On the other hand, it must be remembered that, if the stirpital construction is adopted, and one of the tenants for life dies without issue, there may be an intestacy as to his share, [but] this is not allowed to affect the construction\u2019\u201d citing, in support of the foregoing principle, Campbell\u2019s Trusts, 33 Ch. D. 98, 101.\nThe questions here presented are not free from difficulty; but, after seriously considering the able argument of counsel for appellant, we are not convinced of error.\nThe decree of the court below is affirmed, the costs to be paid out of the fund in controversy."}
