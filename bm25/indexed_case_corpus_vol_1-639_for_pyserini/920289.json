{"id": "920289", "contents": "Pee Curiam,\nIn this case judgment was entered for plaintiff for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense. The affidavit filed by the defendants was clearly insufficient to prevent judgment. The alleged fraudulent representation of the defendants was not properly specified in the affidavit in any material particular and no supplemental affidavit was filed. No error was committed in entering judgment against the defendants.\nJudgment affirmed."}
